Subject: Re: Shipping a bus to Italy

I was in Europe few months ago and made some researches about that, in
case of a really good deal on a bus there....

There is a company called HUAL (http://www.hual_dot_com/) which does it.
Easiest place for me would have been from Amsterdam, NL to New York and
would have cost about US$600 one way. It takes about 3-4 weeks to ship.
You'll find more specific information about the trade route and sailing
schedule on the company's web site.
