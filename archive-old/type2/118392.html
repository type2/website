&gt; &gt; Check the indexing of the distributor drive gear. It sounds like the
timing
&gt; &gt;   is way retarded, if the distributor is out by one tooth you will not
be able
&gt; &gt;   to use the timing scale to time the motor.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; This might be the problem with regard to setting timing with the light.
Looking
&gt; at the picture I thought I had it right.

I don't think so.  The timing light will flash when the plug fires; what the
timing scale then shows you is where that piston is as it travels up and
down, usually right near TDC.  If the distributor drive gear is off by much
you might have to twist the distributor way away from its &quot;normal&quot; position
to get the ignition timing right, but what you read on the scale with the
light is still correct.  Now, what really *will* screw you up in a fairly
&quot;non-recoverable&quot; way is if the cam/crank gears are off a tooth.  Any chance
of that?

&gt; So I have low vacuum for a new engine (assuming no other obvious leaks)
and I
&gt; need the timing advanced for the engine to idle. Any idea what is wrong?
Valves
&gt; have been adjusted to 0.006&quot; per Bob Donald's page on hydraulic lifters.

I have to admit I've never understood the logic of Bob's page about the
lifters.  That doesn't make it wrong, maybe it's just an admission of my
ignorance.  Anyway, it seems to me that providing a &quot;gap&quot; here where the
design doesn't dictate it can only result in low valve &quot;lift&quot;, at least
until things warm up enough.  Why not re-adjust these to &quot;spec&quot; (1 to 2
turns, depending on your orthodoxy), particularly if you don't have the
lifters clattering?
