Subject: Looking for : 4 15in RIM for BUS

Hi,

I'm in Montreal, Quebec.

I would like to buy 4 or 5 RIMS for a BUS, but 15 inch. since I would 
eventually convert my front drum brakes to disk brakes... Could exchanged 
them for our old 14inch rim...

I have a 1966 BUS, with westfalia camper interior.

Thanks,

Caroline or Mike at 514-765-0268

&gt;Subject: [VB] Translation needed for VW tool...
&gt;Date: Wed, 31 Aug 2005 06:02:35 -0700
&gt;
&gt;Hi again,
&gt;
&gt;At the recent C.O.V.V.C. show in Columbus, OH I scored a rare VW Special
&gt;Service tool from an older VW factory trained mechanic in the swap
&gt;meet.  Made by MATRA, this is the tool made to quickly and precisely
&gt;adjust/set proper toe-in on the front suspension of any early VW model.
&gt;Very neat item, I can't wait to throw out my old yard sticks (ala the
&gt;Muir method for setting toe-in) and put this SST to use.  There is a
&gt;small calibration scale on the tool and the words on it are in German.
&gt;Can anyone translate the words &quot;VORSPUR&quot; and &quot;NACHSPUR&quot; for me?  I'm
&gt;guessing it's something like positive and negative, or more and less,
&gt;you get the idea.  Thanks for the translation assistance!
&gt;
