Subject: Westy interior replacement

The wall panels etc on the 81 long ago shed their vinyl and a PO put a
half-assed coat of paint on them without removing the old glue etc. Generally
ratty looking especially when the wood grained Westy components are actually
in great shape. In addition the fabric covered door and hatch panels are just
plain filthy, original color un determined.

I found what I believe is called &quot;tile board&quot; at home depot which is proving
real inexpensive and easy to work with for replacing originals. This stuff is
something like 1/8&quot; masonite with a stark white hard finish  intended I would
imagine for bathrooms and cost $13 a 4x8 sheet. I use the old panels as
templates for both cutting and screw holes and finish off the edges with a
sanding block. Use a formica type jigsaw blade and it is very easy and
smooth.Most of the edges are covered by edging in the van anyway. 

I expect to do the rear and sliding doors as well as the ceiling also. Two
sheets and miscellaneous finishing washers and new screws etc should bring
the total cost to less than $35. Should be very sanitary feeling.
