&gt; To run the accessories that are wired into the aux battery while the bus
is
&gt; running is exactly what the instructions that come with the kit says NEVER
&gt; to do.

This sort of defeats the whole purpose of this extra relay, doesn't it?
Wouldn't you be running your fridge on 12v or propane while you are driving?

I opted to use the instructions on vanagon_dot_com that do not require an extra
relay, and are more than satisfied with the results.
