What did you cut the panelling with?  Is there a special fine toothed saw you
use so you don't rip the edges?

Did you simply lay your old (removed) panelling over birch as a pattern?

What about curtains?  Do you have a source for the (stock) material?  Is it
the same checkered pattern as the breadloafs or were they white prior to '78?

Sounds like your panelling job came of fairly inexpensively, is that true?
 What was total cost for all pieces with Fontana purchased birch.  That
lumber yard is real close by me and I'd love to follow your footsteps if it
worked out good for you.  Thanks.
