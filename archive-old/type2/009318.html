I own a '78 Westy, that will come back from the mechanic's tonight! YAY!!
(If your curious, she was getting two valves, brakes, and clutch replaced.)

Now I need new tires and wheels. The old wheels are in terrible, rusty
shape. The tires are old and make the bus feel like a tractor. My mechanic
said to get 6&quot; radials. I think this is referring to the tire, and not the
wheel, right? 

Anyway, I'm very very open to suggestions about what the best tire/wheel
setup would be. I'm going to have the wheels probably forever, and so I want
lots of different ideas and opinions to work from. I'll probably be buying
them on Thursday afternoon from Discount Tire, here in Seattle. Another
place someone mentioned liking was Les Schwabb. Price is a factor, but since
I have no idea how much these things will cost I'm not sure how much of a
factor it will be. 

Thanks for any information!
