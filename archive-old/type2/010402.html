so, many of you said &quot;exhaust leak&quot;.
i looked and felt around.. and sure enough.
the header i purchased from Pozzi's in sacramento
has a hole near.. well at the welded flange that
holds the canister to the right exhaust pipe.

this pencil eraser sized hole can be patched?
if so, by weld bead only?
i've had the dang thing only a few months...
should i raise a big stink with Pozzi's?
i paid $110 for that &quot;header system&quot;. 
i was thinking it would be because the gaskets
were shot at the link between the heater boxes
and the exhaust pipes.however they seem sound.
 i covered the hole with my finger for a bit
 [they were cold and wet], i'd already warmed up the 
 engine and stopped her for a while... so she was ready to 
 idle right off. didn't seem to make a huge difference.

 also a bit of a high pitch whine , although i ws thinking
 that might be the tranny in neutal at idel.. it vibrates the
 chassis a significant amount... that tranny is going to 
 die soon, i'm sure.

 prolongs the life thta i don't drive anywhere besidsd the 
 drive way.heh.
