Because the &quot;rest of the world&quot; is wrong (IMO)

The common &quot;cigar lighter&quot; sockets are poorly designed for continuous use,
being designed for momentary high-current heating where a bad connection
won't hurt things.  The only thing that holds &quot;cigar ligher plugs&quot; in
place is friction, and for long-term connections they will work loose.
Anyone who has accidentely dropped a coin into a cigar lighter will know
the other disadvantage to their design!

Ham radio folks tried using cigar ligher plugs for their radios, but most
have gone to using a common Radio Shack connector (222 Molex) for 12V
applications.  I use these and they work well.

There really needs to be a good &quot;12V recepticle&quot; standard, and the BMW
approach is as good as any.
