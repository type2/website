Subject: Engine/tranny install advice

Those of you with newer (non-removeable valance) Bays who have pulled your
engine and or tranny. 

Have you done it without help?

How? 

I'm looking at the bus now trying to figure out how I'm gonna get the rear
high enough to get the engine under there. Last time I pulled it Billy (my
brother) was still alive and we cheated by using the Chevy to pull the bus
up on a set of ramps while using the jack under the engine to roll it back
at the same time the bus was rolling back and up. Then we reversed the
procedure for the re-install, used the Chevy to slowly roll the bus back
down the ramps as I pushed the engine along to keep it centered in &quot;the
hole&quot;. 

This one's gonna be done all alone, at midnight, in the parking lot at
work. I have to get that turn-key motor out of the cargo bay onto the jack
(no problem really since I have the ATV jack). Then attach the tranny to
the motor. Then get the back end of the bus high enough to roll the engine
under there. Then lower the bus back to level so I can lift the assembly up
into place.

I have the ATV jack and a small floor jack (15&quot;? lift).

I may be able to do the ramps and truck trick using a come-along to move
the bus rather than the truck.

Ideas??

Curse the Fed for mandating the solid rear valance!!
