Subject: Re: timing advace more info

Sorry, I forgot the following info...
engine--rebuilt longblock 1600
Carbs--40mm Kadrons jetted for a 1600 by the manufacturer (sold by SoCal,
they reassured me that everything was set up for a stock 1600.  Balanced
and idle set yesterday (took about 50 tries with breaks so I didn't pass
out from the exhaust)
distributor--new bosch 009 advance
Exhaust--monza style four tip

Timing--15 degrees btdc
I started out at 5 degrees ATDC and advanced 2 degrees until She idled
smooth and accelerated fine.
Note, anything less that 15 degrees BTDC left me backfiring on the
deceleration


Thats about all I know.  She doesn't hesitate when turning over (which
happens when timing is way advanced).
  

Anyone else want to chime in???  I gotta have her running smooth so I can
garage my non-VW winter beater!!!!!

Thanks

 Well . . I have some chime time . . . :-)

 If it wants 15 deg. , then give it to it , don't be asking us 
dummies  . . . :-)  in conclusioon , if it don't ping on the 
steepest hill, you're golden . . :-)

 I might check the total advance on the dizzy tho . .  to see if
it is advancing properly . . 

 Now on the other hand . . :-) . .  if you're screwing around
with leaks in your exhaust and this is what you call &quot;backfiring&quot;
and then you use the dizzy to kind of &quot;lean&quot; the the mix, then
you are too advanced and it will show up as heat and pinging . .

 The engine will let you know . . :-)

 Oh yes . . do you have a balance tube from one manifold to the 
other ?  the kadrons love them . . low end torque and mileage . .
