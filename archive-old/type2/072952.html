VW Trends mispelled the word &quot;Volkswagen&quot; in the July 1999 issue.

To top it all off it was on page 6 which also happens to be the Editor's
Note section sporting a picture of none other than Henry Dekuyper himself.
&quot;50 Years of VolkswagOns&quot;.

Just thought I would point it out to those who didn't notice.  Maybe its
the way the watercooled VW world should spell the name.

You only live roughly 75 years, so have as much fun as you can even when
things are tough.  Enjoy life's expedition!
