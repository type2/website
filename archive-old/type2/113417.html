&lt;&lt; The difference here is that municipalities would be allowed to set up
roadblocks and check everyone who passes by.  They don't have to work on
one person at a time, they can cast a wide net.  Considering that the new
car dealers just about own our city council, this is of some concern.
They might decide to crack down on everyone driving a car more than 10
years old so as to promote new car sales and the tax revenue it would
generate.

Not good for us vintage VW folk!
