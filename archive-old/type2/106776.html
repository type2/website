Last time I tried to get a rear bumper off was the first time I snapped the head off a bolt. It was the last bolt too,

Bumper on head make Billy angry,

&gt; Has anyone else noticed that the washers holding the rear bumper on are either cracked or about to crack and fall off? The slot in the bumper where they bolt through is oval instead of round and the washer is required for support.
