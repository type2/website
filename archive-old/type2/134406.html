Subject: Re: [T2] WTB - EGR valvle + plumbing for 81

You need to tell us whether this is for a Federal or California Vanagon.
They have different EGR components.

You've described the layout correctly for a Federal vehicle: EGR filter
connected to the crossover pipe at one end and to the bottom of the engine
tin at the other; then another pipe is connected to the top of the engine
tin on one end and the EGR valve on the other.  Have you determined if you
want/need working parts or parts that will simply satisfy a visual
inspection?

&gt; im trying like heck to track down an actual EGR filter and may have to
suck
&gt; it up and get the one from vanagain for $260 or whatever it costs.
&gt;
&gt; but I cannot find any of the rest of the parts I need and im hoping
someone
&gt; out there can help me out.
&gt;
&gt; from what I can tell from the diagrams, the egr filter connects to the
&gt; crossover pipe directly, then connects to the engine compartment where it
&gt; connects to a pipe that then connects to the EGR valvle.
