Steve,

     Would you pull the heads with only 29,700 miles on the engine?  I
rebuilt this engine for the PO in 1996.  I used all new or rebuilt parts.  I
thought it had 35,000 on it but when I checked the reciepts it has only
29,700.  As far as the heads go, I would not pull the tin to re-torque the
top bolts unless the bottoms were more then a couple of pounds out with a
clicker torque wrench.  The oil drip out of the pushrod tubes is less then 1
quart in 2000 miles.  It is a very tiny drip.
