Subject: RE: [T2] Stock Exhaust choices

&gt; If you can get the Liestritz system from Bus Depot:
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=211251053EC
&gt; 
&gt; You will find that it bolts up very nicely.  It seems to have 
&gt; a longer service life than the cheaper options.
&gt; 
&gt; I notice that Ron has appended a /Ernst to the Liestritz in 
&gt; the ad.  You might check ahead to see what manufacturer he is 
&gt; actually stocking or if the manufacturers have merged.
&gt; 
&gt; Avoid Mexican or Brazilian mufflers.  The money you save 
&gt; won't be worth the extreme hassle of making the parts fit.


I list both brands because availability is spotty, so I ship whichever one I
can get at the time. Both are quality German mufflers and I have found them
to be roughly comparable in quality (and superior to the rest). At the
moment, with the Leistritz brand in the process of restructuring, it will
probably be Ernst for quite a while. The included damper pipe, tailpipe, and
hardware may also vary in brand based on availability, but are typically
Ernst (Germany), Jopex (Denmark,) and/or HJS (Germany), all of which fit and
are well made. This setup is far superior to any aftermarket setup, for
about the same price.
