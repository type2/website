Subject: Re: [T2] Is there an alternative to a BN4?

&gt; The idea of a supplemental heat source, particularly one that can be
&gt; used while in camp, is extremely attractive to me. Is there another
&gt; option, besides the BN4, that has been used and found to be effective,
&gt; reasonable priced, safe, and otherwise worth considering. Perhaps one
&gt; that burns propane?

I use a BA-4
