Subject: Re: [T2] '71 westy interior question

He is some info that was sent to me  about the counter over the sink in
early Westys. I have not checked my '73 yet, but does anyone else know if
they have this bumper for the counter to rest on? Was this something on the
71's only or on other years also? I have a seat cover on mine and have not
noticed a bumper, but I have not really looked that close either.

Thanks,
Corbett

Yes, it's a counter-top that folds over the sink.  Hinged on the inboard
vertical panel of the sink's pedestal structure, it opens (swings 180deg) to
become a small utility table that spans the aisleway.  The forward corner of
the counter/table should just make contact with the backrest of the
rear-facing seat behind the driver's seat (left-hand drive).  Now, about a
support solution so that it's not relying only on the hinges:  I discovered,
hidden within the upholstery of the rear-facing backrest, a black rubber
&quot;bumper&quot; placed perfectly for the table to rest upon.  I'm speculating that
is what it is for.  The problem is that because it's inside the upholstery,
the padding and vinyl of the seatback deflects the table edge away, so it
loses its support.  I've not yet done it, but I plan to cut it open
deliberately and re-sew it to expose the bumper fully.  I don't know if the
interior upholstery is original on my '71 or not.  Maybe it's a re-do and
they covered the bumper.
