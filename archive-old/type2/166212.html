Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Help!  For anyone with Hankook tires on a 
  Vanagon/Bubble Bus

&gt;&gt; There's another consideration as well.  I put a set of these 
&gt;&gt; on my 80 Westy, and the handling got definitely squirrely on 
&gt;&gt; the highway, relative to the Michelins I had been running.  
&gt;&gt; With every side gust, it felt like the bus was going over.  
&gt;&gt; You might not like the effect.  I don't think I'd put another 
&gt;&gt; set on there now.
&gt;&gt;

I put a set of Hankook's from the Bus Depot on my buddy's '75 Westy 
right before we left for Everybus 2007, and all I can say is that the 
difference in handling was incredible. Previously it had a mis-matched 
set of passenger tires on it, and after the RA08's were put on, the 
handling in cross winds was so much better. We drive over a bridge 
every day to get to work and it can get some pretty nasty cross winds. 
  I would _highly_ recommend the RA08's for any Bus.

Hope this helps,
