Subject: Re: [T2] attempted theft/repair?/prevention?

Any commercial glass shop can do window screens.

&gt;in it.)
&gt;It doesn't look like they ended up getting in, either that or they locked 
&gt;up after themselves and didn't touch a thing inside.  They pried up the 
&gt;louvered windows and tried to stick their hand through the window 
&gt;screen.  They ripped the screen, but it is not easily patched because they 
&gt;ripped it where it connects to its frame.  My first question is: is this 
&gt;reparable?  I couldn't find them for sale anywhere so I have no idea how 
&gt;much a replacement costs.
&gt;My second question is: has anyone installed some type of alarm or anti 
&gt;theft device that actually works and doesn't send you running out to your 
&gt;car at 3 am every night every time a truck drives by.
&gt;Just another sign to leave this area.

I'd start with a $3 flashing LED that comes on each time you turn the key off.

Will make them wonder and worry.
