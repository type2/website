Subject: Re: [T2] body work?

Go to large book store - look in transportation.

I think the publisher of the book I have is Motorbook.

&gt;Well, if I don't get replies I'll check the archives, but I figured with
&gt;this community there would be plenty of people who'd love to throw
&gt;suggestions, advice, and ideas out, and possibly even get into &quot;discussions&quot;
&gt;over the finer details of what grit sandpaper to use between paint coats and
&gt;so on...
&gt;
&gt;I've got some various bodywork things to do on Lucy my 75 camper. I'm going
&gt;to put together a website with pictures and probably post to the list from
&gt;time to time with updates on the work. I've never done bodywork before, and
&gt;have absolutely no clue what I'm getting into. But, I've done several engine
&gt;rebuilds and such and figure I should learn the next thing.
&gt;
&gt;So my first question then: any suggestions on a book or website that will
&gt;introduce me to the field of pulling dents, grinding metal, replacing rusty
&gt;bits and sections, and ultimately painting?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!
