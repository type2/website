&gt;I just changed out my tranny and am replacing the fluid.  Does anyone
&gt;know the proper gear oil to use?  GL4 is what Bently's says but does not
&gt;give a weight.  Also what is the difference between GL4 and GL5?

GL5 has more high pressure (mostly sulfur in dino oil and cheaper
synthetics) additives.  Problem, uncoated bronze VW synchro rings
(used until '85 or so) are eaten by sulfur.  Not a problem in most tranny
rear end combos where you could use GL5 in the rear and a GL3/4 in
the tranny.  Weddle engineering told me one time the practical difference
is seeing 125k out of a set of OEM syncros instead of 250k (I was needing
to run a GL5 if I bought a clutch pack limited slip.)  OK in later boxes,
good shops should be using the later moly coated rings now days, but
if you don't know and are concerned your best choices for a VW box are
straight GL4s anyway.  Redline MTL or MT90 depending on your POV
about weight, either will work fine I think as both are synthetics anyway.
MTL is 70W80, MT90 75W90, VW recced 80W90? dino oil so the MT90
is more appropriate but I've used the MTL for years, nice in winter.

www.redlineoil_dot_com for a dealer near you, though best price from most
FWD performance companies (many are online for VW's, Hondas, etc.)
Stuff goes $6-$10/qt depending on source, don't whine VW's new synthetic
fill is $40/qt.  Correct GL4 dino oil is available (Sta-Lube still has some)
if you look around locally.
