Subject: Starter Out!!!

Thanks to Everyone who drop me a line reference &quot;Starter Removal&quot;....The nut 
that needed to be taken off inside the engine compartment would not budge..so 
I had to remove the oil filter to get a bit more leverage....And all went 
smooth after that....Hope to get the Starter tested tomorrow..And get back on 
the road..Thanks again to everyone...Adam
