Subject: VW-STILL LOOKING FOR 'BRA' TO FIT '71 TYPE II

Can anyone help me on this?  I need a cover for the front panel of my '71
Bus to cover up some unrepairable (well, unaffordable) damage.  I'm going
to punch holes in it for a front tire mount so preexisting ones are OK.
While I would like a nice one, any condition will do.

Am in the L.A. area.  Will pay costs of shipping, etc.

Mucho thanx,

Nick Pace
