Hey Volks,
I will be moving to albuquerque in a couple of weeks. I am currently bussless,
and am interested in buying a daily driver to drive in and around Albuquerque.
I am going to the University of New Mexico, so I will be a poor college kid.
What my plan is right now is to just get something to drive around the city,
and little by little make it roadworthy to make it back home (South Dakota)
next spring. If anyone lives in Albuquerque and knows of any such busses,
please let me know. Also, I would be interested in hanging out with any list
members that may live in Albuquerque to find out where all the good, bad and
ugly bus shops are at.
TIA
Matt
