I agree, you see far more shortened then stretched. But there have been
some stretched. The most impressive is Charlie Hammill (SP?) splittie limo,
WOW! But I lean more towards a bay stretch, ideally as long as possible
with an early westy on the front and a later westy on the back, opposing
pop-ups you know? Anyway, this guy is stretching a Vanagon now, but he has
a shot and description of a bay he stretched in the past. Probably a lot of
the info about the Vanagon stretch is applicable.
