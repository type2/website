Subject: Re: [T2] Stranded in Southern Utah. Need a helping diagnosis.

Hi Jason,

I thought of that too, but the Vanagon does not have the same rear 
linkage as a baywindow. I discovered this two years ago when dropping 
the engine on Dad's Vanagon westy.

I agree that it does sound like a linkage problem.

Ryan,

To verify the mechanic's advice you are  going to need to have a helper 
work the bus through the gears while you watch the action at the 
transmission end. If the linkage is bent or twisted you will definitely 
have trouble engaging certain gears. Try disconnecting the linkage from 
the transmission and see if the tranny can be shifted using the 
nosecone lever. If so, repair the linkage problem and you're good to 
go. If the nosecone lever can't get you into  all the gears then you're 
going to need to pull the tranny apart for a closer look, or swap it 
out completely.

The problem with Dad's Westy tranny was that we bent the shift rod 
downwards when we forgot to disconnect it when lowering the tranny to 
re-install the engine. Once the engine and tranny were back in position 
I was able to straighten the shift arm with a bottle jack pushing it 
upwards,, and since then the shifter has worked fine.

Happy trails,

&gt;&gt; The mechanic crawled under and came to the conclusion that the problem
&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt; transmission. Does anybody have any other suggestions that I could
&gt;&gt; bring up to
&gt;&gt; another mechanic on monday? Thanks in advance. It would be much
&gt;&gt; appreciated
&gt;&gt; for any advice.
&gt;
&gt; Look at the shift rod coupler at the transmission end of the shift rod.
&gt;   If the rectangular bushings on each side of the cage are worn out,
&gt; then there could be significant slop, preventing proper engagement of
&gt; the various gears.  Judging from your symptom (gears that work are on
&gt; the bottom of the H-pattern), I would definitely make an effort to rule
&gt; out shift linkage problems before swallowing hard and doing the
&gt; transmission itself.
