&gt; Not the top one over the top of the carb(s)/FI. It's amazing how useful that

&gt; about the 73 is better crash protection started that year.

The removable rear apron also disappeared about this time.  :(

So, it's kind of a trade-off.  Improved access from above on the newer
models, but more difficult engine removal.
