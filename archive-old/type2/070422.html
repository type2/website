&gt;HI All,  Found out something interesting about the wiring this morning
&gt;on one of my bugs.  Yeah, I know it's not a type 2, but I think everyone
&gt;will be interested in this.  I was, and still am, having the hot Generator
&gt;problem.  Apparently, if the generator is hot it means that the current
&gt;is getting lost somewhere, so the Generator has to 'work' harder to keep
&gt;up the voltage.  So I decided that maybe if I took all the fuses out and
&gt;put them in one by one I might figure it out.  Well,  would you believe
&gt;that the car will run and function without any fuses in it? =:O  I AM
&gt;getting closer to the solution ... at least the generator didn't get hot
&gt;when no fuses were in there :)  This is a '72 bug.  I don't think the
&gt;buses will run without at least the one fuse going to the coil.  I wonder...
&gt;if the bug will run without any fuses does that mean the main power wire
&gt;coming off the voltage regulator is shorted to the circuit that has the
&gt;coil on it?  Hoboy 8(  I'm still on it.  This is an area in which we
&gt;really need some discussion.  I have had this problem for weeks now,
&gt;without any answers, only more questions.  If I come up with any answers
&gt;I'll be posting them pronto.

You should find a manual that has wiring diagrams for your year. Hayes,
Chilton, Gently all have fairly good wiring diagrams. Bugs will run with no
fuses in the fusebox. The wire from the generator goes to the headlight
relay, then to the ignition switch. A wire from the ignition switch then
runs to the rear of the car and attaches to the coil. This circuit does not
include a fuse, and when the ignition switch is turned on, power goes to the
coil. If the ignition switch is in the on position, and the car is not
running, you may heat your coil up and damage it.

BTW, a hot generator does not necessarily mean that you have a short. Having
a battery that is always run down or blowing fuses indicates a short is
present. Usually, a short is caused by a wire that has the insulation
scrapped/burned off. Look at all the wires that attach to the fuse box for
cracks in their insulation. A digital volt meter is the tool that is the
most helpful for locating shorts; the wiring diagram is the other. Muir has
a great chapter on how to test the electrical system on a bug.

Just a thought - has anyone thought of posting gif/jpg of wiring diagrams
for the various years and models of VW's? This would be a great addition to
a VW web page!
