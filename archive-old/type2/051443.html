That, or some other adapter plate setup, probably could be made to work, but
there would be other considerations:

Peripheral and lateral clearance for the larger wheel/tire assembly, in both
the laden and unladen mode...

    Will the larger wheels/tires clear the trailer chassis and bed?

    How about fenders, if any?

And this would not solve the most critical problem.  You'd still be running
very small wheel bearings.  Though those bearings would be making fewer
revolutions/mile, they'd still have a short service life because of their
size limiting heat tolerance and lubricant capacity.

The small bearings would also be subject to greatly increased side loading,
partly due to the greater mass of the larger wheel/tire assembly and partly
because of the greater &quot;leverage&quot; due to the longer distance between the
bearing and the tire contact patch.  [Think about the forces imposed in a
curve at highway speed]

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Any chance an old brake drum from a bus could be drilled to accept bolts
mounting it to the trailer and then leaving VW studs for mounting?  Sort of
like using the drum in the same way that a wheel adaptor allows other wheels
to be mounted on VW hubs?  Might require machining off the inside of the
drum to provide
clearance and lightening, leaving just the stud face.  &lt;&lt;
