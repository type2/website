Subject: Re: Octane again

In Bruce Anderson's 911 Performance book, he has a large section 
dedicated to octane and performance, with explanations of what
the differences are, pros and cons, additives, the whole 9 yards.
He has enough information in there to pretty much silence this entire
thread.d  If you guys want, I can scan and OCR it and put it up on my
page. When this subjec pops up 5 months from now (which it will
when enuf newbies show up) then we can say &quot;go look at http:...)

I know it kinda takes the fun out of it, but it would preserve
bandwidth.
