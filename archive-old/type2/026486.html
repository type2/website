Subject: RE:  Why is backfiring?
Message-ID: &lt;D3C18AEA0EA1D111B8DA00805F85E889011F8E0D_at_DSNTEXSRV3&gt;

&gt;On my never-run-for-me-before rebuilt engine that I'm trying 
&gt;to test-run, it tends to stall out and backfire (ie, flames from
&gt;the carb).  Izzat a fuel problem?  Timing?  Advice sought.

Flames from the carb are usually one of three things.  
1.)  Your timing is way off (or maybe firing 1-2-3-4 and not 1-4-3-2 - been
there twice!).
2.)  Your valves are way off (like you set the #1 valves when #3 was at TDC)
and/or your distributor is installed 180 degrees off.
3.)  You've got an intake valve that's not closing all the way or has a hole
in it (bad, possibly expensive, and will require removing the head).

When I rebuilt my 73, a friend was helping put on the sheet metal and
dropped one of the screws.  He didn't see where it went and I told him it
didn't matter as long as it didn't fall into that opened sparkplug hole.  He
swore that there was no way it could have.  First time we fired that baby up
(dual Weber 44 IDF's), I missed singing my eyeballs by a heartbeat as a
column of flame came 8 inches up out of the #2 stack!  It seems the screw
got caught on under the intake valve and prevented it from closing.

Hope yours is really bad timing/valve adjusment/1-2-3-4!!  Let us know what
you find...
