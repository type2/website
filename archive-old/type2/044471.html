Subject: Re: [T2] Why did they cut my bus?

OK, somewhere, at sometime, I saw a page about replacing this without looking 
so ugly... does anyone have some info on this for him? Basically it was 
cutting an oval out, using a sheet metal panel with a gasket (I think  / 
recommend) and screwing it in with sheet metal screws. Anyone... anyone...
