&lt;&lt;  Here in the UK  one of the latest go faster product is a fibre glass rap

Only if you can afford to replace your exhaust pipes early and often - the
heat retention is murder on cast iron. 
You could also run a double pipe air intake and fill the space between the
pipes with dry ice to super chill the air...
