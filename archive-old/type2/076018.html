&gt; It's much different than the &quot;run your engine at 2k for 20 minutes&quot;
&gt; method...

Mike,

I think that it is only different in being more theoretical and less
procedure oriented.  There are some differences, but they are minor and
related to the different natures of the vehicles. The discussion of theory
is solid (brake vs. break aside :-) and valuable for us to know.

Below, I compare Joe Fournier's procedure in the library to the NTNOA
page:

From Joe Fournier:

  1.Immediately upon starting, run engine up to 2000 rpm for 20 minutes.
    Watch oil pressure and temp gauges. You're letting parts machine
    themselves to each other for preliminary fit.

  2.Drain oil while it's hot. Replace before starting again. If time
    allows, let engine cool and check valves.

From NTNOA:

    An engine's initial run should be used to bring oil and coolant (air,
    oil, and/or water) up to operating temperature only, with little or no
    load, then shut down and allowed to cool to ambient temperature. This
    is important. After each run the engine needs to completely cool down
    to ambient temperature.

My comment:

Both agree on a no-load run.  To bring a properly tuned and cooled VW
engine to full temp takes 20 minutes, so they match in that respect.  The
time would be different for a bike engine which is smaller and has no
forced air cooling. Really the only difference is the 2K RPM which is not
spec'ed in the NTNOA article, but is implied elsewhere in the article by
phrases like, &quot;We must achieve a happy medium where we are pushing on the
ring hard enough to wear it in but not hard enough to generate enough heat
to cause glazing.&quot;  I'll bet an inquiry on initial run to those same
experts would produce a recommendation of close to 2k RPM.

One flaw in Joe's article is the &quot;if time allows&quot;.  Time *should* be
allowed!!!  The NTNOA article is correct, IMHO.

Joe Fournier:

  3.Inspect drained oil for metal particles. React accordingly; check for
  magnetic properties to distinguish aluminum and brass from iron.
  Aluminum = bearings...some wear is expected, but no chunks. Brass =
  timing gear or valve guides. Shouldn't find much of this, if any.
  Iron/steel = crank, cam, rings, cylinders.._dot_definitely no chunks, but
  I'd expect *some* of this in breakin oil.

NTNOA:

  Oil change comes much later, read on...

My comment:

This may be apples vs. oranges, the load on a &lt;500 lb. bike is way less
than a 1 ton bus.  The idea of &quot;lightly and gently&quot; for a bus is hard to
imagine... put it in 1st and you are pushing a ton, no matter what.

Joe Fournier:

 4.Run engine for 5-10 miles doing the drive up to 55; then wind
   (down-shift) down to 20 mph...at least 5 times...as many as 10. You're
   letting parts further machine themselves to each other with the
   emphasis being on the cylinders, which must machine themselves under
   load because their position/geometry is slightly different at different
   RPMs...thus, the variance in RPMs and the downshifting. I don't fully
   understand this, but Bob Hoover instructed me to do this and I do it
   religiously. I consider this as important if not more important that
   the 20 minute breakin.

NTNOA:

  This time give the engine light loads at relatively low rpm and stay
  out of top gear. Lugging the engine, i.e., low RPM with a lot of
  throttle (manifold pressure), is more detrimental than high rpm. Another
  key is too constantly vary engine load during the entire break-in
  period. A constant load is not ideal for breaking in bearing tolerances.
  This second run should last only 10-15 minutes before another complete
  cool down.

My comment:

There are definite differences here.  Going to 55 (in 4th, I hope!) then
slow down vs. light loads and stay out of top gear being the biggest, but
I think this may be a motorcycle vs. car thing.  MC's have more gears and
run at higher RPM's.  The times are, however roughly equivalent, if you
match minutes vs. miles and the constant variation of load is the other
vital point both articles make.

Joe Fournier:

  5.Let sit over night. Check valves.

    I record all valve settings (per valve) and maintain that information
    for the first 300 miles. I check and adjust valves at the following
    times:

     after 20 minute break-in
     after 5-10 mile break-in
     at 25 miles
     at 50 miles
     at 150 miles
     at 300 miles

    If I notice trends, I check more often. Since work is about 25 miles
    round trip, I usually get pretty close on these.

NTNOA:

  The third run should see slightly higher rpm with light to medium power
  loading using short bursts of acceleration to help seat the rings. Again
  10-15 minutes of running should do it and again avoid top gear. A forth
  run should consist of light to medium engine loads with a few more
  bursts of medium-high rpm, and lasting just 10-15 minutes varying the
  engine load and again avoiding top gear. Next while the engine is still
  warm drain the oil and change the filter. This gets out the new metal
  particles that are being worn away. Most of the metal particles will
  break away within the first 50 -75 miles. To ensure the rings seat well,
  use the same high quality oil and don't be shy about short duration high
  rpm blasts through the lower gears after the oil has been changed.

  A few more 15-20 minute sessions should be used to work up to the
  engine's redline gradually increasing the engine loads. After some
  definite hard running and 250-500 miles it's a good idea to check the
  valves.

My comment:

Here again there are more similarities than differences.  VW's are very
sensative to valve adjustment, Nortons may well be less so.

Note that the Norton's first oil change occurs at ~1-2 hours of run time
rather than 20 minutes, but the initial oil change occurs rather quickly
in either case. This is a point of contention among many people I have
talked to.  Do you leave the initial oil and it's filings in to speed
break-in or change it to slow it down... intelligent people I respect vary
on this and I am not sure there is a &quot;correct&quot; answer.

In either case, you are building the engine up to &quot;normal&quot; operating
conditions over a series of runs with frequent checks.

Joe Fournier:

  6.At 300 miles, pull the engine and retorque the heads. This is a step
    many people skip, but I'm not inclined to. It will tell you a lot
    about how your engine is running and is neccessary to assure engine
    longevity and reliability. It gives you a chance to tighten up tinware
    and do those things that you meant to do but were in too much of a
    hurry to do the first time around.

NTNOA:

After 500 miles re-torqueing the head is suggested.

My comment:

Again, a slight difference in mileage, but not significant.

In closing:
All in all, given the apples and oranges nature of the beasts, I would say
that there are more similarities than differences and if someone told me
they broke in their VW engine using the NTNOA procedure, I would certainly
not have any problem with that.
