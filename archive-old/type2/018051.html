I've been playing w/the  idea of fixin this bus(1980 Vanagan) for a long
time I'm sure some of you know my sob story by now. So I got a windfall
and towed him to the shop. Its having a fuel prob. so I asked the guy to
go a head and fix the fuel prob. then we will see what kind of motor
work we'll have to do. Well, it may need to be rebuilt or a new motor
put in. if so the time for serious thouhgt comes in.
questions: is this Model worth restoring? is there and shortcomings in
design that would be a PITA to have forever?
what kind of money  am I looking at for a rebuild or motor + labor. Is
it worth it to rebuild than to buy new engines?
this mech told me a new engine installed  would be around 3000...is that
good? |; thank you in addvance--
