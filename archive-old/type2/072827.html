Subject: Re:  Campmobile owner's manual supplement

Joel:

A couple of years back I bought a brand new, never used, campmobile manual
for my '79 westy from Schiff European Automotive Literature Inc.  It was
the real deal, but I don't remember what I had to give for it, but I don't
remember it being outrageous. I spoke with Barry Schiff at (401) 946-4711.

Check it out!
