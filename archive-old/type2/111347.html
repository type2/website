Subject: Re: [T2] windshield tips

Have
&gt; lots of people on the outside gently
&gt; pushing on the glass.

what would be considered lots??
2-3?

1/8&quot; diameter, something like twine?? or thicker?

Do you set the bottom seal in first then have the
string start from each lower corner working into the
top center of glass??

thanx,
robert
