&gt;   Most definitely get a regualator -- unless your pump is capable of
&gt; automatically cutting off when it feels back pressure, which most won't.
&gt; Otherwise it will overpower the float and you'll see gas leaking out the
&gt; top of the carb.
&gt;     The stock mechanical pump only puts out a few psi.

Good point about the stock pump. If anyone is building a type 4 engine
from scratch and using a 75 or later case, I believe Rimco in California
has mentioned that they can machine the blank to accept the 72-74
mechanical pump- far and away the best fuel pump for a carbed 2-liter.
The pumps are a little expensive new but cores and rebuild kits are
around. I would guess this little pump would put out enough fuel to
supply 90-100 hp. (That should be enough for most of us!)
