&gt; Your original e-mail asked how to remove the front shift rod bushing, but
now you seem to be asking about the bushings on the rear shift rod (between
the rear coupler and the front shift rod).
&gt; If you meen those bushings (which look similar to a shuttlecock) then you
must reove the engine and transmission to replace them.

Yes I was trying to say these, I was hoping I did not have to remove the
engine and tranny, but i guess there is no choice, thanks for your help.
