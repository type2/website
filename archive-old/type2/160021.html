Subject: Re: [T2] Crash test ratings?

hey guys  I had a customer of mine that got ran off the road and hit a  
building with his right corner of his 78 westy,  he got tore up some cause  he 
didn't have a seat belt on and the right side of the bus was pushed back to  the 
front axle. I think he was going about 30-35 miles an hour. All and all it  
held up fairly good  later  Mark dearing
