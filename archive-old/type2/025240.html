Subject: Canadian dollar, BN4 gas heaters, engines?

Ok, watching PBS tonight, I see how the Canadian dollar is down and that
sending some US $ up there is win-win for both sides.

Anyone in Canada want to take advantage of the opportunity?  Locate NOS
stash of parts?  Pull Gas Heaters out of junk yards and sell them for
US$70.00 to US$100 ...  (German BN4 / BN6 out of late loaf early VANAGON
being in high demand here... especially with all the switches and relays)

Any leads or offers to broker appreciated.  Gas heaters would be a great
possible ... I bet we could work out some good deals.
