Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Dash

Todd asked:


 Does anyone have a Type-2 dash that they'd like to sell that is damage
free? I had just re-installed mine, and I'm not happy with it. I really don't
like doing all this work, and then re-install a cracked dash.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

You might want to mention the year of your bus. Dashes are different on the ends with the amount of screws.
Some are 2 screw, some are 3 screw.  And then there is the early 68 that did not have the padding on it.
Along with the NON USA non-padded dashes......
