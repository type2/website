Subject: Generator Swap 30 AMP for 38 AMP

Hello all,

I have a 70 Sportsmobile that the generator crapped
out on a week or so ago.  I decided to switch to an
alternator conversion, but dont know if it will arrive
in time to install it for BNNTA.  I tested it per Muir
and Bentley, and it is the generator.

My question is, I have a working 30 AMP generator and
voltage regulator on my 71 KG that I could swap out if
needed.  From the archives, I would have to use the KG
generator pulley, would anything suffer from the
decreased amperage??

Daylight driving only, stock radio, etc...

Does this sound kosher to you guys and gals?

Thanks
Chuck
