Hi folks and Greg,
   When I painted my fiberglass top I used a marine paint.  It's a single 
part polyurethane called Brightside Polyurethane and is made by Interlux.  
It's made to be used on fiberglass boats and so it stands up well to the 
weather.  Just know that it is slow to dry.  The can says 2 hours to touch 
and 16 hours to overcoat.  My experience showed it to take a little longer 
than the 2 hours.  It comes in a variety of colors and has a nice shine.
