Subject: Re: [T2] Ball joint replacement

Mike
this is a burly job:
#1 Make sure that your mechanic knows how to press VW ball joints...special 
tools involved.
#2 Before you remove the arms, take the dust caps off (yes they do come off) 
and make sure that your weld holding the sheaves together is intact...if not, 
weld them together BEFORE you remove the arms...If you don't have access to 
anykindofwelder clean out good with carbcleaner and try JBweld?...It's just 
that you don't want to have to realign them once the arms are off...they are 
really PITA to do that way.
#3 Get the right rubber and clamp for your stabilizing bar.
#4 Replace your tie rod while your at it...probably needs it anyway.
#5 Replace your inner and outer wheelbearings...ditto.
The parts are available from Bus Depot .Com:
...Balljoints...$17ea
...Clamp and Rubber $8 set
...Adjustable Tierod with ends...$27
...Wheelbearing set...$17
Check out procedures in the archives...
Aloha and Good Luck'
