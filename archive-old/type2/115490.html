Subject: Re: [T2] Birth Certificate... the next step?

how do you get this birth certificate?

&gt; However, I would now like to get more details, specifically where in the US
&gt; was the bus shipped? Who purchased it? etc...Does any one know how do get
&gt; this information?

the import port is listed in the M-codes. That might lead you on the
trail of PO's, but I kinda doubt you will have the extreme luck of
that.
