Subject: Question about brake refill line and resevoir
Message-ID: &lt;380BA3A9.E7BE4E27_at_mail.wf_dot_net&gt;

Hi Folks--

Under my 1970 Westie I've got a plastic two-pronged brake fluid resevoir
that sits right on top of the master cyliner. There is a plastic brake
refill line that comes from the upper resevoir under the dashboard
directly into this two-pronged resevoir...and that's where I have a
leak, where the plastic refill line plugs into the two-pronged resevoir.

My question is this: is there supposed to be a rubber grommet that fits
between the refill line and the two-pronged resevoir, or does the hose
plug directly into the resevoir?

If there is a grommet (my inital impression), RMMW doesn't carry it. If
I don't need a grommet, can I simply cut an inch off the current hose
and reattach, or is it necessary to buy new hose and replace the entire
refill line...and is it necessary to bleed the brakes afterward, since
I'm not messing with the resevoir or the master cylinder?

Pardon my inexperience, and thanks for help!!!! I need to get this leak
fixed!
