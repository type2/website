Subject: RE: [T2] VWTrends rumor

Didn't VW Trends go out of print once before?  In the 80's?  Certainly I may
be mistaken and I have not taken any time whatsoever to confirm my hazy
memory of this, but I think it did.  Whether or not these types of magazines
give good tech info or vendors with integrity, for me is a side issue.  If
this rumor is true, what I will miss is the photography and coverage of
national events here in the U.S. and occassionally Europe.

I likes tuh lookie at duh purty pikchurs....
