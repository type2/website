Hi,
I've just finished building a 1776 engine for my 71 bus.  It has a full flow
filter, stock heads, counterweighted crank, stock pict-3 carb, header system
all in a new case.
My problem is after it warms up, it just keeps heating up even at an idle.  My
temp gage after 10 min went past the 180 degree mark so I shut it down.  The
oil pressure at idle dropped to about 10 pounds.  Here is what I have checked
so far.
-The oil pressure is great at start up  40 at idle and 60 - 70 pounds at 3000
Rpm
-When the engine starts to heat up (180degrees) the oil pressure is 60 pounds
at rpm but 10 pounds at idle!
-I have checked the air flaps and thermostat all fine
-checked timing -fine
-checked the fan belt-fine
-checked the pressure relief valve spring- not stuck
-it has enough oil
tomorrow night I will be checking the cylinder pressure( gulp ) 
I am wondering if my fan is not putting out enough air?
If you have ANY IDEAS I would love to hear them (my wife is hinting that I
should take it to a pro mechanic! gasp!)

thaks Rob
