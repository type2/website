Subject: EveryBus 2007 T-Shirts Info

Howdy all. As EveryBus 2007 is growing ever closer, and so is the deadline
for pre-ordering T-Shirts, I wanted to give a last reminder on the
information. I am also doing dash plaques again, as I have for the last 3
years.
While I will have a few shirts available onsite, now's your chance to
guarantee your shirt, in your size, and can even custom order a
sweatshirt, long sleeve Tshirt, etc. In addition to checks and money
orders, as I've done for the last few years, I can also take paypal now.
Information and pics here:

Thanks, and see y'all there!
:)
