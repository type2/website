Subject: Re: [T2] cross your fingers

&gt; Jest fer fun...What was the one vehicle (VW or other-
&gt; wise) that any of the list members wish they had
&gt; held onto...?-(
&gt; Extra points for giving/selling away cheap that which,
&gt; had you kept, could help finance your retirement... ;-(

In 1995 I bought an original paint '65 21-window for $1200 from a place in
western VA (the name Cash's rings a bell)....I drove it home to Lynchburg...

It had the plates 65 DLUX

I put tires and brakes on it and drove it for about two years....I then
traded it straight up for a '78 Auto Camper from a guy in Va Beach...

It has since disappeared....I even tried to find it....
