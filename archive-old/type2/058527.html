Subject: Stumbling on low tank? ('72 single carb)

My wife noticed that our bus runs roughly when the gas tank drops down to
about 5 gallons or so.  It has the 1700cc engine with a single Weber carb.
As soon as she fills it up (with 89 octane) it runs much better.  She's
noticed this over the last few tanks and she alsways buys gas at the same
station.

I think I remember something like this being discussed before, but I could
not find it on the list archives.

Any tips on this problem?

Thanks
Dave
