&gt; &lt;&lt; Also anyone know of a good way to cob job the rust holes especailly the
&gt;  wheel wells and floor boards and runners, I have some sheet metal riveted
&gt;  down but need to plug up any leaks.  &gt;&gt;


I use the 4 inch wide metal construction tape as a temp hole cover or rain
stopper until I can do the job right.  As everyone else says it doesn't
stop the &quot;Cancer&quot; but it will keep the rain out.  I usually wire brush the
loose rust off, hit it with a couple coats of &quot;Extend&quot; then cover it with
the tape. is usually good for a year or two holding action til I can get
to it to do it right

&gt; Metwiz2 is probably having a fit if he's reading this- just don't try to sell 
&gt; it a year from now and tell potential buyers it's &quot;rust-free&quot;.       Jeff S.

SShhhhhhhhh!
