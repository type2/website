&gt; slightly forward of the fan. Since it was dark I decided to feel
&gt; around under the bus for a fresh oily spot.
&gt;
&gt; BINGO. the filler neck tube that connects to the case was the
&gt; oiliest. I wiggled the tube and could feel a bit a looseness. I felt
&gt; around for the bolts. First I found the bottom one. There was not
&gt; bolt in to top - just a hole where I suspect a bolt should be. I do
&gt; not have a Bentley handy to see how the setup is supposed to be. Can
&gt; anyone confirm that there should be two bolts holding the metal
&gt; portion of the neck to the case? What size is the bolt -length,
&gt; diameter and thread size?
&gt;
&gt; I would take out the lower one and check but the engine carrier is in
&gt; the way. It looks like the top one (which is missing) can be replaced
&gt; without removing everything.

The lower one is a nut on the rear side.
The upper is a nut also but.....it is on the front side. What you think is a
hole for a bolt is the threaded hole that the stud is in. Both nuts are
13mm. [8x1.25]
