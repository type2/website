Subject: tire question
Mime-Version: 1.0

ok volks...

the suspension is almost completely replaced...tonight i will put on the 
new tie rods and ends.

so, since i can't access the type2_dot_com web page at the moment.._dot_can someone 
refresh my memory?!

currently on the bus ('75 Westy) i have Cordovan Radials MSR 185/70R14 put 
on by the PO.


first...are these passenger car tires?  if not, what class are they?
second...what load range/class tire do i need since it is a bus AND a camper?
third...where is there a good place to order tires online? (reputatable and 
CHEAP!)

all of the tire joints in my area would have to order the different class 
tire anyway, so i figured maybe i should just go to the source.  the only 
nice thing about having, say SEARS, order the tires for me...i that i can 
go anywhere in the country and get customer service if there is a problem.
