Subject: Re: [T2] Bonus engine plus questions

Nah - It's all junk. It'll grenade if you try to build it. Better just box 
it up and send it to me for safe keeping. I know how to dispose of it 
safely and according to EPA guidelines... &lt;grin&gt;

&gt;I picked up an old 72 deluxe yesterday and discovered, much to my delight,
&gt;that in the rear passenger area there was an apparently COMPLETE 1700 engine,
&gt;complete but dis-assembled. It looks like all the parts are used except for
&gt;the case. Which appears to be a NOS case with a &quot;CB&quot; code. This thing is
&gt;spotless the only problem is that some of the studs have some surface rust
&gt;from sitting in a damp bus on a farm for a couple of years.  I am possibly
&gt;going to try to build it unless someone really needs the parts, most notable
&gt;is the NOS case. Anyone looking to buy an engine?
&gt;My questions: The cam and crank I found have some light surface rust on them
&gt;from being in the moisture, is it possible to just polish these up with a
&gt;light sanding or wire brushing on a grinder, then use them in the re-build, or
&gt;is the sanding and polishing of these parts not reecommended?
&gt;Also, can I put this engine back together and OMIT all the emissions crap?
