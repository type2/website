Subject: Re: [T2] replacing window seals w/out breaking window

Brian,

Same as you, I've done bug windshields before...no problem...

T2 is a different beast.  To get the windshield out, just get a box knife
with an extendable blade and cut it out from the front.  Slide the blade
down next to the glass and cut the seal thru to the metal frame.

Take the rubber 1/2 seal off and then do the same from the inside(with a
helper on the outside.  Eventually, it should tilt right out from the top.

If it is already cracked, you are probably doomed.  I don't believe that
you can get a new seal on it and back in with out it cracking the rest of
the way and probably breaking.

As one listed stated(and i can verify), getting a new seal on a t2 bay
window is like wrestling a boa constrictor....I tried for 2 days.

Then stretched it all day, threw it in the dryer for 10 minutes(in a
pillow case) and had a helper.  Finally got it on and back in the bus.
Yes, and my hands *did* hurt afterward&lt;grin&gt;

Looks good now!

Cheers, dave

&gt; Thanks to everyone who replied concerning the 71 vs 73 issue.
&gt; 
&gt; Now my question is about replacing window seals.  I've replaced a windshield
&gt; seal in a bug so I'm familiar with the technique used to get the window and
&gt; new seal back in place.  That windshield was already cracked and removing it
&gt; only cracked it more.  Additionally, the article I read on www.type2_dot_com
&gt; concerning window seal replacement mentions that the glass will be broken
&gt; when removed.
&gt; 
&gt; My question is how do I get the glass out without breaking it?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Brian
