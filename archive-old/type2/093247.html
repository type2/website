Subject: Re: [T2] '78 westy timing

Pull the injectors to see which one is leaking with pump pressure. My guess 
would be the cold start injector.

How rich is it running?

&gt;Thanks for all of the answers. Some PO evidently removed the timing strip
&gt;so I will replace. Thanks. Anyone have suggestions,remarks about how gas
&gt;is getting in the oil? I have checked the injectors, cold start valve,
&gt;replaced the points which were pitted and replaced the injector seals. I
&gt;also used gas treatment and drove several miles- still gets fuel in oil.
