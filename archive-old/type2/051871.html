Subject: [T2] recomended vendor!!!!!

I contacted several places recomended by California Smog folks for a rebuilt 
EGR (thanks Jack in Costa Mesa). I found one that deserves our bussiness. He 
rebuilds the EGR valves. There is a piece of rubber that has to be a 
specific type and shape inside the valve. He has hunted high and low to find 
it and also the machine that forms it. He also puts in a new stainless steel 
seat. Consequently its not cheap. However I find it wonderfull that someone 
will go to that trouble to make factory spec parts for our beloved vans.

The other four companys I spoke with did not seem to be as well informed as 
he was when we were talking about the specifics of the valve.

Please support him if you need any smog related parts for your 80-83 
Vanagons (78-79 too I think). We need to keep these people in business.

Company name:

Darron I belive was his name.
