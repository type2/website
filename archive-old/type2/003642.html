Subject: [T2] Engine Pull (long)


&gt; Hello list. I have a 1970 Westy with a Brazilian 1600 DP motor in
&gt; it. I pulled the motor yesterday afternoon to replace the firewall seal
and
&gt; some other stuff. I have both Bentley and Muir. From reading these, I
&gt; deduced that my engine pull differerd from an original 70 because my motor
&gt; has the dog house oil cooler. This meant that only one of the top nuts
&gt; removed from inside the engine compartment, the one which holds the
starter
&gt; on the upper right (fif). The other upper mount, on the left side, because
&gt; of the dog house, is removed from under the bus. It is located right
behind
&gt; the clutch lever. On my bus, there was no clearance around the bolt to get
a
&gt; socket on. Part of the bell housing casting was in the way, very close to
&gt; the bolt head.

Try putting a small, but, thick lock washer under the bolt,  that should
raise it up enough to clear the bell housing. Then you can use your socket
on it.

I tried a wrench, but there is no room to move it once on. I
&gt; sat and scratched my head for a while, then went down to the FLAPS to get
a
&gt; 17mm &quot;crows foot&quot; wrench. This did the trick, just barely.
&gt; Did I have so much difficulty because the bell housing is for the
&gt; original engine? I was thinking of using an allen head bolt when I put the
&gt; engine back in. Would this be O.K. Also, the tin around my spark plugs
&gt; looked hacked up. I think that the P.O. used the original single port tin
on
&gt; this dual port motor. Are there two different styles?

Yes, single intake port tin, and dual intake port tin.  I think 71 was the
first, last,and only year for the type 1, dual  intake port, upright engine
in a (US) bus........


Thanks in advance for
&gt; your kind advice.
&gt;
&gt; Jeff
