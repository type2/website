&gt; Since I don't use this, and don't plan to use it, can I just take all that
&gt; wiring out to tidy up, or am I making for a pandora's box?

You can do what you like, but the next person might want to restore the
system and will say nasty things about you.  I'd suggest that you not
remove the wiring unless it is causing you trouble.
