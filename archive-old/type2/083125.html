Subject: Looking to buy one.

Hi ya'll,

I'm hoping to buy an air-cooled VW bus soon. Tired of
taking the city bus all the time! Can anyone recommend
the best year to look for, and/or someone to check it
out and/or do a bit of repair/resto if it needs it. I
would ideally like to find a power blue one with a
pop-top in excellent condition. I don't think I'll
need any of that sink and stove stuff though. It seems
that that stuff is just more stuff to break down. I
know this might be a bit much to find, but I'm keeping
my hopes up.

Thanks,
Terry
