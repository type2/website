Subject: Re: [T2] VW parts vendor with fastest delivery...

I might want to chime in here that Ventura Warehouse Group (VWG) does
quite a bit of drop shipping for Bus Depot and that either John or
myself see and enter these orders (by fax from BD) and make sure that
those received early enough in the day go out the same day they are
placed from the warehouse in Southern California.  This sometimes
translates into a bit faster ground serivice if you are on the west
coast to about the eastern side of the Rockies.

Dan, Mike and Kay at the Bus Depot do a far amount of calling John or
myself throughout the day to determine a close as possible for
shipping charges, especially where oversized sheet metal is concerned.

There are of course times when we will be out of stock of an item and
we let Bus Depot know right away if that's the case.  There's been a
number of times where I will call and give them a heads up if we're
running short or if an overseas shipment has been delayed (especially
if the LA/Long Beach port is moving too slow, which is usual).

&gt; Orders placed with the Bus Depot get broken into two classes, regardless of
&gt; whether placed online or by phone - Standard delivery and Expedited
&gt; delivery.
&gt;
&gt; Standard ground orders get placed in queue and are shipped based on the
date
&gt; received (unless an item has to be ordered in, which can cause a
&gt; usually-short delay). Usually this means they go out the door within about
a
&gt; day or so of when we get the order, if in stock of course. On a
particularly
&gt; busy week it can be a bit longer, but even then we usually get caught back
&gt; up relatively quickly.
