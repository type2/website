Subject: Re: &quot;One-man brake bleeder&quot;

&gt;I am looking at the &quot;one-man brake bleeder&quot; in the RMMW catalog ($34.95)
&gt;and thinking that it is doubtless way overpriced. It's a vacuum pump,
&gt;isn't it? With a reservoir on the business end for checking bubbles?
&gt;
&gt;I am guessing that by squeezing the handle, brake fluid is drawn out of
&gt;the cylinder, bringing any bubbles with it. The air bubbles pass into the
&gt;pump reservoir and exit through a break in the pipe (the break is
&gt;submerged in brake fluid).
&gt;
&gt;Have I got it right? Because if I do, some clear hose, a jelly jar, and
&gt;one of those pumps that fits on a drill chuck (8.95) will do the same job.


I have always lived by the old saying &quot;You always get what you pay for&quot;.
The type of bleeder that uses a hand held vacuum pump is made so that you
can hold a vacuum while the fluid is being bleed out.  They also have a
gauge to let you know what your vacuum pressure is so it doesn't drop too
low and let air bleed back into the system.

I paid $75 for mine from Mac Tools a number of years ago.  It has bleed
many a line with no problem.  If you spend a bit more for the best and if
you take care of your tools, you only have to spend your money once.  I
have tools that I purchased back in the 70's that are still in great shape
and by today's $, I spent pennys in the 70's for high quality.

Believe it or not, you don't save any money trying to get by cheap.  In the
long run, you will pay MUCH MORE.  And when it is something that has to do
with safety, such as brakes, don't be cheap.
