Subject: --- where are you living??? ---

&gt; From: Jean-Baptiste Le Pesant &lt;jblp_at_zone_dot_ca&gt;
&gt; Date: Fri, 25 Oct 1996 22:32:50 -0400 (EDT)
&gt; Subject: --- where are you living??? ---

&gt; Where you live: State, city, and a nearest big city (to help me
&gt; locate you on a map!)
Illinois....DeKalb (between Chicago and Rockford)

&gt; What is you van: year, model
'67 Deluxe
'84 Vanagon L
'67 Double Cab
'67 Westfalia
'67 Westfalia walk-thru
'66 Deluxe (parts)
'73 Superbeetle (wife's)

&gt; What is your name:
Jim Bryant

&gt; What is the name of your van:
Only the '67 Deluxe has earned a name: Potluck

&gt; Do you think I can answer how old are you??
46 in American Standard years...23 in Metric VW years!

&gt; And give me your suggestion!!
I suggest you join NEATO (pre-'68) or LiMBO (post-'67).  Each
spring (April/May) they send out a booklet listing members
willing to help travellers in VW buses:  the TTT (Transporter
Tourist &amp; Traveller) Directory.  It lists about 400 people around
the world (mostly USA/Canada) willing to talk with, help or
provide camping space to brother/sister bus owners.

Et, je peux parler un peu de Francais.
