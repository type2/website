Subject: my 73 auto lives kinda???

well, i was forced to drive my 73 hi roof automatic bus to work today 60-65
mph flat ground.  i have the flaps installed and they are all the way open
as i still need a thermostat but it seems it is running hot.  the only
thing i've done to the engine is install an svda dizzy (had a 009) and put
the flaps in (they were missing when i bought my 72 (engine is from the
72))  I can put the dip stick on the back of my hand w/o burning skin off
but can only keep it there a few seconds.  the oil pressure light came on
as i got off the freeway just blinking a bit but as soon as i started
driving again it went right out and didn't come back on as the engine
cooled a bit in city driving for the last 1/2 mile.  anyway, gurus, help me
out here,  many thanks for this great list.
