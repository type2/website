Okay, what about all of us poor slobs with progressive setups? 


Jonathan:
I have a Weber 32/36 DFEV carb on my 71 Bus, and I drilled and tapped a 1/2 inch fitting at the base of the center section.  It works OK, but these carbs seem to be quite sensitive when it comes to tuning with vacuum requirements.  It's taken me a few weeks of tinkering to finally get it as good as it's going to get.
