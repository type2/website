Subject: Electronic Ignition System

Hey Everyone
    Okay, I checked the archives for this, but I only found snippets.  In my 
quest to make &quot;George&quot; reliable enough to take off to college, I'm seriously 
considering an electronic emmission system for reliability (Points are my 
sworn enemy).  Anyway, I called a parts place in sacramento that a local VW 
shop recommended, but they said that the ignition system they offered 
wouldn't work because my '77 std (California Model) was &quot;Single Vacuum,&quot; and 
putting the system in would violate CA smog regulations (?).  Can anyone tell 
me if this is true, and if there is a system that I can cram in there that 
doesn't violate my state's useless smog rules.

Thanks
Matt
