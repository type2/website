Subject: RE: [VB] Recommendations for a digital advance timing light...

Hi Bill,

All those bells and whistle just means something will break sooner.  I
have a simple 6/12V Snap-on unit.  It has one knob for the degrees
advance.  I set the timing statically, start the engine, set the light
for maximum advance and then give it throttle to where it should be
fully advanced and then check it out and make small adjustments if
needed.

Having to use a separate power supply sounds like a pain and not easily
used on the road.

Hi all,

Thought I'd upgrade my timing light and was looking around for a digital
timing light that you can set the advance and read the tachometer, etc.
There
seems to be lots of 'em out there, and the ones that list a voltage
range seem
to be 10 to 16 volts.  I want one that can somehow be used on both my 12
volt
and my 6 volt cars.  Any ideas or recommendations?  If it has to have 12
volts, can you supply power from a portable 12 volt battery but use it
to
time/work on a 6 volt system???

Someone out there has encountered this and has a solution...
