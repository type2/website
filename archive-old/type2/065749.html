Subject: Bus Restoration

Hi all,
As some of you might have noticed in the past, I have asked some 
questions regarding my ongoing 71 transporter restoration.  Well, one of 
the many tasks at hand is finding a reliable autobody shop to work on the 
body.  Luckily the body is in excellent shape (originally from CA), and 
the frame is 100% solid, but needs a few dents pulled and some bodywork 
TLC.  One problem:  I'm picky, but I'm willing to pay for a quality job.

The questions are:
1.  Does anyone know of a reputable shop in the New England area that 
they recommend?  Possibly with personal experience and/or references and 
actual restored buses I could look at...

2.  What should I expect to pay for a quality paint job (exterior, 
original 2 tone paint, interior white, engine compartment 2 tone, various 
body parts such as bumpers, and general body work)?  This will also need 
to include a new headliner and window replacement (I have most of the 
rubber).

3.  What should I watch out for?

4.  How long should it take?

The bus is currently stripped out with only a windshield, and I am 
refinishing all the interior parts, engine, etc.  Transportation of the 
bus is not a problem.

Thanks in advance!!!
