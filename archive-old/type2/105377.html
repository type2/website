Subject: Fuel Line Snafu

I was working on my 1980 Vanagon today, Pulling the clutch slave 
cylinder for r&amp;r. Discovered fuel dripping over on the passenger side 
above the axle and in front of the engine. On closer inspection I found 
what looks like a hard plastic tubing coming from the fuel tank toward 
the engine. It appears the P.O. had a leak in the area where the fuel 
line passes through the engine tin. The hard plastic tubing has been cut 
off about 5&quot; ahead of the engine tin, cloth braided fuel hose has been 
slipped over the plastic tubing and hose clamp applied. I looks as 
though the plastic hose has been kinked just in front of the hose clamp. 
Not sure the rubber hose is F.I. rated.

I plan to replace all the fuel lines in the not too distant future. Is 
there some way to Join some F.I. Quality fuel line to this plastic line 
without leaks? Am I going to have trouble replacing all this plastic 
fuel line with F.I. hose? Is this plastic line standard on an 81 air 
cooled Vanagon?

Thanks
Tom
