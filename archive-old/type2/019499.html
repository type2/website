Hi John,

I forgot to tell you in the email.  A shop sold me what they identified as a 75
1800.  The engine serial # prefix of GD identified it as a 2.0L, Lucky me.  If
the prefix on the 75 is an AW or ED, it is an 1800.  GD and GEs are 2.0L.  If
you have the computer which came with the engine, it should work.  In my humble
opinion, since the computer senses basically mass air flow, head temp, and
ambient air temp, I submit the computer will properly adjust to a proper
mixture.  In a carburated pre smog moter, an increase in displacement required a
smaller main jet in the same size carburtor.  Larger displacement = greater
volume air flow per stroke.  Greater volume of air flow through a venturi = more
fuel pulled in.  As VW increased displacement, the used smaller jets to maintain
the same mixture.

Keep smiling,

Mike

&gt; The engine is complete, pulled out of a 75 bus. It has all the FI
&gt; parts, brain, harness, etc, .  If it's the original engine from a 75 then it
&gt; should be a 2 liter shouldn't it?   Also will the 75 engine mate up with my
&gt; 73 tranny/bell housing?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; John
