Soon come, mon. Take it easy, bus consumers. It's great to live in the
US and be able to order software at 10 o'clock at night and expect it to
be delivered by noon the next day. Or get your food fast at a
drive-through. Photos in an hour, glasses in an hour... can I get that
FedEx'd?

But it's not realistic to expect every business to operate with that
kind of phenomenal speed.

I am tailgated daily by folks who are obviously in a BIG HURRY, and it
seems to irritate them to no end that I'm NOT in a big hurry. I like to
mosey along. And I don't have a problem with the Bus Depot operating on
human terms. 

I work with scientists who somehow expect me to be able to crank out
their presentations and other graphic work instantly, and who express
concern that E6 film still takes a couple of hours to process, even on a
rush basis. It's not realistic. They don't understand what goes into it
all. I'm not pressing them to come up with favorable results in their
experiments faster than they can, although it would be nice if the stock
options were worth more than the paper they're printed on...

Loosen your screws. Be happy with low prices and actual bus driving
people running the business. Don't disappoint yourself. Be realistic.
And don't chew on my favorite vendors, please. It'll shine when it
shines.
