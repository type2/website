Subject: Re: [T2] Stranded in Colorado

Hi Bob,
&gt; well I have had both over more than 30years
&gt; including a new 412 in 74 when
&gt; FI was fairly new to VW....I don't think I would
&gt; ever have another carbed
&gt; bus.
&gt; 
&gt; I think the biggest problem with the Fuel Injection
&gt; is the learning curve,
&gt; most folks don't want to take the time to learn to
&gt; think differently.  But
&gt; the rewards of a properly operating fuel injected
&gt; type 4 engine is worth
&gt; it.
Well,that may be the case but the guys that work on my
VW's &amp; my brother's &amp; my friends curse at FI on a
daily basis.
The computers tend to be overly sensitive &amp; both of my
friends who changed to carbs had an unusually large
amount of water in their fuel tanks that couldn't
accounted for in any other way but with the FI.
Don't ask my how or why.
Also,my friend who changed to Webers found that the FI
was nothing short of dangerous...his bus used to stall
in the middle of intersections &amp; die for completely no
reason.
Sure my other mate who had a FI Type 3 had only good
things to say about the FI.....when it actually
WORKED.
If it works it's wonderful,but by &amp; large many people
I know have just found it an irritaing &amp; expensive
venture.
&gt;  the fuel injected type IV engine IMO is the engine
&gt; Ferdinand would have
&gt; built if he could have.
Maybe but I'd like to think his fuel injection
would've been more reliable.
I agree...I think the traditional Cal Look crowd who
prescribe to Der Kleiner Panzers style of performance
i.e.twin 48IDA's &amp; a stroker motor need to open their
minds.
Cal Look is fine but lets face it Webers &amp; Dellortos
are VERY old technology.
But the only aftermarket VW style FI out there is VERY
pricey,especially here in Australia &amp; to be frank the
standard one doesn't exactly do us proud Down Under.
Maybe it's the heat that affects the FI or maybe we're
old sticks-in-the-mud,but it hasn't been that reliable
for most people I know who've owned one.
Hey,if you can tell me how to get a VW FI setup
running well I know where I can score a 1600 FI motor
NOW &amp; I'll certainly consider using it.
But I'm not holding my breath.
I'm willing to be persuaded though.
&gt; &gt; :-)
&gt; &gt; Cheers
