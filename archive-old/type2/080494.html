Subject: Re: [T2] steering coupler folks be aware!!!!

Volks,

I was kind of ignoring this thread because i thought it was about pulling
the pitman arm off the steering box.  I just read a couple tho and it
turns out to be about the coupler between the steering shaft and the box.

First, I have replaced more than a couple.  Second, I do not believe you
can get the real VW bus ones any more, but would be delighted to be proven
wrong on this!  The original dampers were square and had steel or FG
reinforcement, as Andy mentioned.  The only replacement I have found is
the bug damper which is solid rubber and round.  I do not see any
reinforcement in it, tho there may  be and it is just not exposed.  Third,
and very important.....

**************************************************************************
When you install a new damper make sure you install the bolts thru the top
and put the nuts on from the bottom!!!!!!!
**************************************************************************

You are supposed to use new anti-vibration nuts, and I do recommend that
but as a &quot;belt and suspenders&quot; measure, putting the bolts thru from the
top ensures that they don't fall out, even if the nuts fall off.

The job is a doddle to do without removing the steering box if:

(a) you jack up the front end of the bus and put it on jack stands; and
(b) you have a helper to turn the wheel 1/4 turn at a time and to insert
    the bolts and hold them with a socket while you tighten the nuts.
