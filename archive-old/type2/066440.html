Subject: Re: Heat for da bus

I've been contemplating on what kind of heat to use in my little storage 
shed I built, and in my search for a good heater, it seems to me that a 
double-eye propane heater will work well.  I know the kerosene heaters 
work great but they are expensive.  So this got me to wondering, if one 
had a way to anchor down the propane bottle, could you use a propane 
heater with the infra-red elements?  Granted, it is sort of an &quot;open&quot; 
flame but I would think if a person anchored it real well, that it would 
be an excellent source of heat.  And all you'd have to do is make sure 
you had enough rust holes for fresh air. :-)

What do y'all think?
