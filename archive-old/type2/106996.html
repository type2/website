For FI engines, anything like 3% and you certainly have an issue, something 
is not spec, and you are approaching the point where the system cannot 
compensate. A tight motor will give clean idle and running at less than 1%.

For carbed engines, a tight motor will idle at between 2 and 2.5%. Any 
setting beyond 3.5% and you begin to see unburned gas and potential for 
cylinder wash, and you have other issues that should be corrected.

Know that most cylinder wash naturally occurs during the first few minutes 
of operation while under cold to warm running. If you do mostly short run 
driving, commuting but a mile or 3 daily, you should inspect your oil level 
weekly and if you see the level coming up, and/or you can smell gas when 
rubbed on your fingers, or it is apparently thinning, change the oil.

A sure sign that the motor is operated without sufficient warmup and full 
operating temp is the yellow matter custard, not dripping from a dead dogs 
eye, but inside the oil filler cap and tube. This comes from the condensed 
water inside the crankcase that remains from the initial warmup cycle. So 
you will have both gas and water contamination

If the motor is kept at operating temp for 5 to 10 minutes or more this 
moisture and gas is evaporated and sent out the breather. No build up, no 
issues. Normal oil change intervals are sufficient. But if you do have this 
short drive issue, you should pull and check the crankcase breather box 
(T-IV) as a part of regular lube maintenance inspections. Also, if you have 
gorilla snot at the oil fill cap, you may also find monkey phlegm inside 
the valve covers as well. Short run driving falls under severe operation 
conditions and requires spezialized maintenance, from the earliest T-II 
Bentley, rule of thumb, lubrication service every 4 to 6 weeks. But 
maintenance by inspection will prove how much is correct for your actual 
use.

Bottom line, if you are running at 4% co or more, you will get cylinder 
wash and should resolve the cause sooner rather than later to avoid more 
costly damages.
