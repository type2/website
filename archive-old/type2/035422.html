Subject: RE: Electric fan cooling proposal

I did a quick calculation to see what electrical power would be required to
replace the engine driven fan.

Assuming for a moment that a 3 HP electric motor per side would provide the
required cooling.  Converting mechanical HP to electrical watts:  

Power = 3HP(746 watts/1HP) = 2238 watts

 and

Power = (Voltage)(Current)

 so

Current = (2238 watts)/12 V = 186.5 amps

The actual current draw for a 3 hp motor would be somewhat larger to account
for friction and copper losses.  To make it work you would need to be able
to obtain sufficient cooling with a fairly small motor(s), like 1/4HP total
(about 20 amps). Good Luck.

All I want to say is that the stock fan, by testing with dynometer, takes
about 7
hp at 4500 rpm.  (my source was several magazine articles concerning vw dyno
tests in vw trends and hot vw magazines, they refer to over 10 hp at race
engine
rpms like 6000)

You are therefore looking at matching that sort of power with your two
electric
motors.  I think even a 3 hp electric motor on each side is too heavy and
impractical to power at 12 volts, maybe 10 amps each?

I remember seeing the cfm in one of the vw workshop manuals but don'at have
it at
present.  I bet the cfm you are working with is too low or is for idle
speed?

But if there is massive efficiency to gain from outside air collection, my
own
theory is that it will require a duct to the front of the vehicle, forced
air
feed to the system would work to reduce the current draw at high loads.

I hope it works out because this is a commendable project for research.

By the way, if the engine access limitation that frustrated you was the need
to
pull the engine to replace the generator, I have a simple fix for that.
There's
a way to refit the generator without using two 10 mm nuts that attach it to
the
backing plate, and under this method it goes straight in and out in the car,
no
problems.  I posted this advice about a week ago
