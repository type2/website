These tools are available at most auto parts stores.  They come in two
versions, one is simple stamped steel and the other looks like a large
screw drive with a forked end.  Not very expensive.  I've had mine for
about 15 years.

&gt;       Jeff Carver is right- a fork-shaped tool would be MUCH better
&gt; for removing door inner pannels. I think I'll try to make one from
&gt; a thick-bladed putty knife next time I'm making tools...
