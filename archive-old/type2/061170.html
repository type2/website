I'm talking to one person in the UK and one in Australia about distribution
there. The nature of this thing is that the CDs can be burned one at a time
locally so it's possible to do small local distributions if that solves the
problem of high shipping/transaction costs.

I don't know if the UK distributor could ship to Europe without VAT/duty
hassles but unfortunately there don't seem to be many European subscribers
anyway.

Please stay tuned.
