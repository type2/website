Subject: Re: [VB] What H4's is everyone using in ther Buses?

It is prudent to install relays with bulbs that have more draw than stock. I have a three relay system in mine and pulled a new 8g main power wire from the battery + terminal to the fuse block under the dash to be sure I had adequate power for the bulbs (and the monster stereo/amp/sub woofer)
I am now using the new technology blue 65/65 watt bulbs with better light than event the 80/120 bulbs I had before. 

I also rigged a relay system to allow me to flash my high beams with the dimmer switch but that is another story.
