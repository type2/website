Subject: &quot;carpet&quot; for awning...

My costco has a pretty nice 6' x 9' &quot;astroturf&quot; kind of carpet, but much
softer and lighter! for $25.00.  Very lightweight, and hoseable.  I've
been keeping my eyes open for something that would make a nice carpet
for the &quot;patio&quot; area.  Colors green, blue and gray, I think...  I got
the green for the desert, looks like a patch o' lawn.  Pretty nice on
bare feet.

Teri
