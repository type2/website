&gt; does anyone know what the best timing for a 1970 bus with a AD code

Your timing will depend on the type of distributor you have.

Take a look at your distributor:  

	a) does it have 2 vacuum hoses leading off of it to the
		carb?  If yes, you've got a vacuum adv. dizzy.

	b) if not (or alternately) look on your distributor for a 
		part number.  If the part number ends in (or includes)
		&quot;009&quot;, then you've got a Bosch 009 mechanical adv. 
		distributor.


Right.  So for the 009, you want to time it to 30 deg ATDC at
full advance.  Expect full advance to be at or above 3200 rpm.
So yeah, 30 deg _at_ 3200 if you've got a 009. 

Not sure how to time a vacuum adv. dizzy, but http://www.type2_dot_com/library/electrip/dvh.htm 
from the type2 library says:  set it at 0 _at_ idle, let it warm up, then
~5 adv, but that's for a '71, which is a different engine than you have,
and, i'm not sure if they chnaged the dizzy between those two years
(doubtful).

So, I expect you'd be good to go with ~5 deg atdc, after you've let it
warm up a bit.  And if not, I'm assuming someone will correct me here.  :)

	-t
	-answering a number of the questions i asked months before
		and waiting to clean up and try out the 001 i have
		sitting in a box somewhere.
