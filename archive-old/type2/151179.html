Subject: Duncan's new bus (oops/power loss update)

Duncan,

Welcome aboard,

&amp;gt; I'm reasonably new to this group, and was lucky enough to get myself a 1970
&amp;gt; Deluxe Sundial US Import T2 at VanFest in the UK

Cool, my best friend in California also has a 1970 Sundial, and a 1966
Sundial.

&amp;gt; questions that may seem daft but what the hell!

Go to the archives for basics on maintenance, routines, basics.  Most topics
have been done to death here, and done well.  Also read through the library.

&amp;gt; What's the best oil to use in it? Do I need a different version for winter
&amp;gt; and summer?

Many will say SAE30 or 40 for summer and 20w50 in cold weather.

&amp;gt; When I brake I get a dull clacking noise from the righthand rear wheel
(it's
&amp;gt; drums all round) - could this be the brakes?

If it makes noise when you brake only, and is consistent with wheel RPM's,
it's probably the wheel in question and probably something braking related.
Brakes are a good first system for a newbie to look at.  Get the Bentley
manual, replace your rubber brake hoses NOW!  Have a look at your shoes for
wear/evenness/replacement.

&amp;gt; What are the little odd bits of maintenance that I really should get in the
&amp;gt; habit of doing regularly? Especially for longish journeys. And how often?

Valve adjustments and oil changes at 1500-3000 miles depending on your driving
style.

&amp;gt; if I replace
&amp;gt; the rubbers, on the cab doors in particular, will they be a pain to remove
&amp;gt; and replace again next spring when I come to get a quick spray done?

Window seals are push in/out.  Cab doors are glued in, knowwhatImean?

&amp;gt; When I rub down the various small patches of surface rust, what's the best
&amp;gt; thing to do? Rub back to bare metal, treat with a rust inhibitor, sand back
&amp;gt; again and prime?

Yes to all, and grind off any heavy rusting before chemical application.

&amp;gt; Would a spray-can primer be good enough until I get a
&amp;gt; top-coat of colour put over when it goes in for its respray?

No, primer is pourous and will rust through.  At least rattle can it.

&amp;gt; The first job is to scrape off the
&amp;gt; old belly protection ,which is pretty flaky, wax-fill the cavities (was
&amp;gt; thinking of Ditrinol) and reseal the underbelly.

Big job.  Many say the factory coating holds up well and is difficult to
scrape off.
Folks in the US like POR-15 quite a bit.

Good luck,

Billy
Murfreesboro, TN
