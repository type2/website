Subject: Re: [T2] What's a &quot;Pure&quot; bus?

&quot;Gotta keep these things wound up, but many people

is just the way the engine needs to be driven.&quot;

Does the same logic hold true for the 1600 SP?  I'm
driving my first bus with an upright and wondered if
it likes to be revved or am i overworking the beast?
