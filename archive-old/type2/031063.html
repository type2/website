&gt; Sure could.  I started teaching my daughter to drive a stick when she was

&gt; had one to try as an option, but that was it.  I was told (would kind of
&gt; like to know if this is true, doesn't seem possible) that the military is
&gt; going to automatics because so few new troops can drive the sticks.  Tell me
&gt; that isn't true, Matthew.

don't know about the military (when I was there they were all sticks) but
in the bus industry almost all buses even the Greyhounds are automatics
now, one reason is the lack of stick skills but the other is that it is
far cheaper in the long run.  seems too many drivers were burning out
clutches (some intentionally)
