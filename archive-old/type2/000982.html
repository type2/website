Subject: Parts Find in Florida

Hey Volks,
I was out hunting for parts today and I finally found the long rumoured
Mother Load of  Bus Parts. The guy, &quot;Bunny&quot;, is on his last legs, as he has
Multiple Sclerosis(sp?) and though he has a sense of humour about it, knows
instinctively that he won't be among the living for too long. He is living
in a pretty shabby state and is selling all of his 20 plus years worth of
Bus stuff. Heat exchangers? He has more than twenty...(hey, in Florida they
just pull em out). Complete Exhausts? Too many to count.  Westy stuff? at
least four complete sets in various layouts. Many rebuilt Trannys from many
years. Many Pancakes, a few uprights. Ready to go... Clutches, Brakes(discs
and drums) Hell, this guy has got 20 years worth of Bus Stuff that he wants
gone. Cheap!!! I will be going to his &quot;other&quot; warehouse tommorow. He has
asked me to post a partial list of what he has available. I will try to take
some kind of inventory and post it in the next few days. I think that
someone with a trailer and space to store this stuff would do well to think
about coming down here and buying him out. Cheap!! He  lives at his
warehouse has had to stop working for more than an hour at a time due to the
fact that he has almost no stamina. Sob story aside, I will do what I can to
see that he at least gets some food and such. Also will try to help get the
word out about all of this stuff. He can be reached at (305) 687 9004
anytime.
