Hiya Mike,

This is probably fixable by either you or a locksmith.  Depends on how you 
want to handle it.  
I'm assuming from your description that when your door is unlocked and closed 
you cannot open it using the door handle trigger only, right?  If you have 
you door open and you try the handle trigger the latch does not move, correct?
This can be remedied by you by simply replacing/fixing the entire latch 
mechanism.  Pretty easy (except for one step).  Pull off the door panel.  
Undo the allen screws (2) holding the handle assembly.  Remove the three 
latch (two on the door edge, one behind the door panel) screws.  So far, so 
good.  Now the tricky part.  Before you can remove the latch assembly you 
have to remove the rear channel guide for the window.  This can be a bear.  
Anyway, once the latch is out you have three options........ fix it yourself 
(kinda fun), take it to a locksmith, or just replace the entire unit.  Once 
fixed, replacement is just the reverse of removal.
Let me know what you decided.

Mike
