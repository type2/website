Have a complete Eberspacher BN 4 heater fs. Believe it's the older model.
Was operational when we bought our $400 camper last spring. I removed it
because SO was scared to death as it was mounted between the front seats.
Ok, so I was afraid of it too, and I'm fearless. Po had the fuel line and
rusty lower end of tailpipe laying against one another through same hole in
the floorboard....guts-ball type of guy.

Model (?) : 201295
serial:         72401

It just needs power run to it, fuel line attached, and a safe place to mount
it. Has a short, through body type shroud on front, with a pull knob on
it...so must have been mounted UNDER chassis. (Type 4?). In any case, I
can't help you with the technical stuff. Listee Ron Van Ness has a very
complete article on installation problems/solutions, which I could ship with
it..but you really should check it out yourself before buying. Other than
probably patching lower 3 inches ot tailpipe...ready to go.

It's in Western NC. If shipping needed, UPS fee is in addition to the $75
price. I'm Karl v. S. trained to sell cheap :), so if this seems too high,
let me know. I really doubt it tho' after seeing the prices on all the
&quot;partial' crap fro sale at swapmeets.

Marv Krupp....about to move back to Fla for the year...we don't need no
stinkin' heater.
