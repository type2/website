Those of you who have these set ups, so you run your brake vacuum off of one manifold or both?  

another q.    I hook up a vacuum gauge inline to my brake booster to determine if I have a leak in the hoses or diaphram and the vacuum gauge needle was bouncing very fast between 5 and 20 (hg).  both at idle and as I brought up the rpm's.  The vacuum is currently pulling only from one cylinder (#1).  That is where I have it tapped.  What does the fluttering needle indicate?  Also I think I have a clogged idle jet on that same carb, which might be causing some of the readings.

any ideas?

paul.
