Subject: Garage Sale Finds

The wife and I dumped the kids on Grandma this morning and hit the garage 
sale circuit.  The forecast of rain for the weekend really cut into the 
number of sales, but I found something at each one we went to.  Goodies 
included a copy of &quot;The Love Bug&quot; and a copy of &quot;Herbie Goes to Monte 
Carlo&quot; (25 cents each).  At another sale I was walking by a table when 
the wind blew open the cover of a large format atlas to reveal a full 
page ad for a '90 Westfalia Camper.  What the heck, only 25 cents.  At 
the same sale a copy of the 1967 VW Dealer promo &quot;Think Small&quot; turned 
up.  This is a small hard-bound book with VW related cartoons, stories, 
and jokes.  Again, only 25 cents.  Other finds during the day were a pen 
&amp; ink drawing (framed) of a street scene in Eureka Springs, Arkansas with 
a Bubble Window Westfalia parked on the street ($1).  I also picked up a 
sunvisor for a '50s Beetle (I think).  It is clear, dark green plastic 
with a metal frame.  It looked familiar and when I picked it up I found a 
VW logo on the back.  Only 50 cents.

Just little treasures, but it made for a fun morning. :-)
