Subject: Oil Breather

As I was tinkering with my bus this morning I noticed that the air cleaner
has a pretty fair amount of oil in it, obviously from the breather tube.
This is a 74 1800cc with a Weber progressive and stock breather. When I
popped the top plate off of the air cleaner there was a sheen of oil and a
few srops collected on the bottom plate. The filter element itself is damp
with oil and wet on the rubber edges.

Does this seem excessive to anyone? Any ideas as to what could be causing
it?

regards,
Dave
