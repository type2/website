Subject: [T2] 1600 in a 72'??

I recently purchased a 71' van which has had a single
owner since it was bought in 1972 in Switzerland. 
Because it has 410,000 km  on it i bought it for
parts, the front part of the frame is rusted out and
the steering doesn't work.  However, he has a brand
new 1600cc engine in it with under 8,000 km on it.  

So I was wondering how hard it would be to put the
1600 engine in place of my 1700 in my 72' camper. 
Mine has 72,000 origninal miles, and I was planning on
swapping gas tanks anyways so the motor would be out
(do the gas tanks match up? from everything i've read
they do.) So I was wondering how possible is it to put
this new engine in my bus. 

And if it's not going to happen, is there anybody who
would be interested in this almost brand new engine
with everything attached?  

Thanks for the advice
