&gt; The are very customer friendly.

&gt; Camping World  1-877-273-2002

With the exception of an installer I worked with, I've found Camping World
to be uniformly snotty and their customer service to be just about the
bottom of the barrel. I'd highly recommend using independent RV places for
camper needs. Or West Marine for &quot;RV&quot; supplies/parts cheaper than Camping
World. Maybe I've just had bad experiences, but I do not regard them well at
all!
