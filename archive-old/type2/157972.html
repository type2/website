Subject: Re: Masonry Sand

I am surprised that no one has mentioned that one should not use silica
based sand as the very real danger of silicosis.

This disease is not something that you want, it is a pervasive, aggressive
particulate that infiltrates the lung tissue, and much like other
particulate diseases, is not shed.

see: http://en.wikipedia_dot_org/wiki/Silicosis

Kindest Regards,

Mark

&gt; &lt;&lt; I used children's sand box sand and the blaster was OK as long as the
&gt; sand was Sahara dry...Any moisture in the sand and it stopped...&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; BTW--sand box sand it pretty aggressive to be blasting away on sheet
&gt; metal--
&gt; Yea, the unit your talking abut really just sucks the sand---but Silica
&gt; sand would be a much better bottom line, as far as the finished product
&gt; goes.
