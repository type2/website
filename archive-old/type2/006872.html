Subject: Need help with alternator problem

Hi everyone,

I wanted to post this query to the group...

During the past two summers -- Las Vegas summers (105+) -- I have had a
problem that seemingly relates heat to alternator output. For those of you
not familiar with the Wayback Machine, she is a 1971 hardtop Westy with a
Bernie Bergmann hydraulic 1835 using a CB Performance DFI (Digital Fuel
Injection) system. It runs great and passes smog with ease. When things heat
up, June to September, if driven for some period of time -- then engine and
engine compartment is obviously quite hot. When extra load is placed on the
system, e.g. head lights on, Mr. Swampy running on high (It works great in
the almost negative humidity of the Mojave) the engine starts cutting out.
Turn everything back off and off we go! My assumption at this point is that
the extreme heat is impacting the alternators output . This never happens in
the cool months. Anyone with any ideas?

Thanks,

Scott
