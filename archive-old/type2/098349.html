Subject: Looking for braided lines for my 70 bug gas heater

I'm looking for the braided steel fuel lines for my gas heater in my 70 
bug, as the originals on the car I just bought are toast. Does anyone 
know where I could get a set of these used or new? I am not sure what 
model heater it is, a B2 I believe the small one that sits on the drivers 
side under the front hood and has a line right down into the front 
drivers side of the gas tank.

Many thanks,

Courtney
