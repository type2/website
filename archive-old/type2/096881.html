Subject: Re: [T2] many thanks

&gt;What was the problem though?
&gt;
&gt;I like to hear the solutions.
&gt;Chris M.


me too. my 68 turn switch isn't working on right turns. the lever doesn't
hold down during turning, nor when straight while signaling the right turn
for that matter.  on the late bays i know about the spring and two plastic
tabs, but on the earlier models, i'm wondering.  - steve
