&gt;I need some cv joints for my 69 and was wondering if any of the list members

&gt;could get a whole reman axl. 

At $40 you are just getting the joint. You need new boots probably and hardware and that whole kit runs $50-60.

If your own labour is worth money to you and you don't have a puller you might need, get the complete axle. If you want the experience (and sometimes it ain't pretty) and don't mind spending money on tools get the joints.
