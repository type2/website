Subject: how do I install a baby seat in a bus

I would like to install a baby seat in the bus for my 2 year old son.  I
assume it would go in the back seat or the backwards facing seat behind the
driver.  What kind of seat would work?  How would I install it?  I have a 73
Campmobile.  Thanks for the help.
