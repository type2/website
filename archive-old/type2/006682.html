Hi, It's me again.  Due to circumstances beyond my control, I am unable to
get the flags.  Sorry for any problems. This list rocks. Ciao from
Italy....Sep 00, Drifter, my family and I will move back to the states.
I look forward to meeting many of you during the bus campouts.  I am still
open to the BPRS if it rolls.  Drifter runs great due to help from many of
you. I really appreciate the comradre. I feel like you are part of my
family.  Ciao!
