Andy,

I bought Big O 27/8.50-14 LT tires for Bleu ('77 ASI) a couple of years
ago.  Ran them about 20k miles before they HAD to be replaced.
(Treadwear)  Would not buy them again.  Feel a bit penny wise and pound
foolish.  Am trying Costco's Kirtlands in LT 195-14 right now.  They too
are 'cheap' tires.  About $48 each.  Other WetWestie members swear by
them.
