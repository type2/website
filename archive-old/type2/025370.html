&gt; I think maybe a better approach to this problem is to find a way to make the
&gt; access hole less of an eye sore. I haven't taken a real close look at the
&gt; hole yet. What I have in mind is to cut off the flap of metal that remains.
&gt; Then fashion a small frame to fit the resulting hole. At that point, hinges
&gt; and a lid could be attached so that the hole at least has a finished and
&gt; intentional look to it.
&gt; 
&gt; What does everyone/anyone think??

I think you've got a great idea. Put a seal around it, though.
