Subject: Re: [T2] papery stuff

&gt; Just to throw another idea into the mix, I used fabric that looks kinda 
&gt; like water/clouds and people love it. Plus, it really makes the bus 
&gt; look more spacious. You might want to try it ;) 

How about mirrors on the ceiling?  Sounds like a good upgrade.
