Subject: Re: [T2] Painting wheels with POR

Chris,

I have some of the same issues on some original vw wheels.

It's called the Faraday Cage Effect.  Where you have two surfaces with a 
&quot;deep&quot; corner, the powder does not get as electrostatically drawn in to 
the crack.

Powder coaters &quot;nightmare&quot;...found this...

I believe the answer is to use some of the &quot;special&quot; metal filler and 
smooth out the cracks so that the effect is not quite so bad or 
is elminiated.

Several powder coating companies sell such a thing.

BTW, you can see some wheels that I powder coated on my... ummmmmm... 
&quot;other ride&quot;(Brazillian Puma...also a vw) here.

The black is the powder coated part.  I have about 4 hours each worth of 
work in these wheels.  They are aluminum.  The last picture is a little 
fuzzy, but seeable.  Sorry they are so large.

BTW, I *did* clear powder coat the rear sides, but did not coat the
area where the drum/rotors will bolt up because of the difficulty of keep 
ing the clear out of the area where I wanted just black.  I have 
some others that were done at a shop and are completely covered in powder 
coat.

Chris, I *want* to see your bus on the road eating mustangs for lunch!!!

Cheers, dave

&gt; If the wheels you had powder coated were prepped right, they should be

&gt; Probably right. I won't argue... 
&gt; 
&gt; For all the hoopla regarding the advantages this refinishing system, 2
&gt; years, and &quot;just showing signs of rust&quot; is no bargain--
&gt; Interesting thread all the same! Thanks ALL!
