Hello all:
    Over the next week or so my bus will be going under the knife
(er...wrench). She will be getting a transmission transplant, new cv joints,
new wheel bearings and a stock shift kit to replace the Em*i POS one that
some PO thought would &quot;look cool.&quot; I am replacing the 71 transmission with a
70 (it's the only year I could find). The only problem with the tranny that
I bought is that the gear selection lever and bushing are rusty. I would
like to replace them with the ones from my old transmission but I'm not sure
if they are compatible and if they are, where would I find the gasket that
goes between the shift housing and the transmission? Any tip, hints, ideas
sources or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
TIA,
Jeff Mitchell
