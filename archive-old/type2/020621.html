Subject: idling problem 77 bus

Hello, I have a '77 bus that has been converted to a 1600cc,
dp,34-3 solex, stock, petronix. My problem is when you first
start her up, she won't idle cold unless i set her choke
almost full closed with the idle arm sitting on the
stair-step almost at the top. if you let her idle like that
for a couple minutes and take off, she will still die unless
you stay moving for at least a couple miles and she gets
warm then she's fine. it's real strange, seems like a vaccum
leak , but can't find it. the idle will stay steady for a
few seconds and then slow down and die, if you hit the gas
for a split second, she'll rev back up for a few seconds at
a idle, then die again. the carb is almost new and had it on
my bug and is good, and i left the choke setting just the
same(about half closed-cold) never changed anything on it.
can't find any leaks from the intake manifold boots, or
ends. . i have the main idle screw turned up so she will at
least idle for now but real annoying being that high.
electromagnetic cut-off jet is working properly too. i have
noticed though before  if you pumped the brakes she would
rev (vaccum assist) but now instead it kills her if you do
it long enough?  should i turn up my choke richer??any help
would be greatly appreciated!! -mark
