&gt; I know this one has been beaten into the ground ,many times here but I want
&gt; to know if any of you have tried the following tires and can tell me about
&gt; them. I do almost entirely highway driving with a very ocasional gravel
&gt; roads. I am trying to decide on a tire and the only one I have heard people
&gt; speak highly of is the Michelin Agilis 61. So let me know what you can
&gt; about these tires:
&gt;
&gt; Goodyear Wrangler HT Load (C) Speed (R) rated at 1710 lbs max PSI 55
&gt; Bridgestone 603V Load (D) Speed(R) rated at 1855 lbs max PSI 65
&gt; Dunlop SP LT 5 Load (D) Speed (R) rated at 1855 lbs max PSI 65lbs

I use and like the Bridgestone 603V.  It is available from any Firestone
dealer and they often run sales, so if you plan ahead they are very
inexpensive.  Highway stiffness is good.  I do a lot of gravel and dirt
roads and these tires do fine.  The lack of an aggressive tread is often
an advantage in loose conditions as the wheels can spin without digging a
hole.  Since the 603V is available in the stock 185R14 size, you can use
the stock inflation pressures.
