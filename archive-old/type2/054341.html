Subject: definition of rebuilt engine

I believe you've answered your own question. The rebuilt can range in
quality from meticulous assembly of parts either remachined to original
specs or new all the way down to the minimum fix necessary to get a broken
engine running again. Upon request, most rebuilders will provide a list of
features and components, though.

What follows is my opinion on the game that is being played in the industry.
Delete now if you don't care for lengthy, chatty discourses.

In the absence of legally binding and enforceable norms, reputation may well
be the only incentive for a rebuilder to produce a quality product, which is
often not enough incentive when glossy pictures rather than word of mouth
are the only criteria accessible to most buyers.

There are also other factors that play against the buyer, the most important
being asymmetric information:

An engine is not a transparent commodity. Typically, you cannot tell a good
engine from bad while it's sitting on the shelf or from a picture in the
magazine. They may all look shiny from the outside.

The typical buyer is not sufficiently trained to ask the right questions. If
he were, he could probably build his own. The typical buyer of VW engines is
a kid and mass rebuilders know that.

Once the engine is installed, chances are it will run (at least) for a few
thousand miles. After a few thousand miles, it is not always clear-cut who
is to blame for the failure. Besides, the typical buyer will probably
already have sold the vehicle a while ago and warranties are rarely
transferable to the new owner.

The owner must bear high transactions costs when returning an engine under
warranty. Even assuming the engine has to be pulled anyway, return shipping
still costs a fair amount and rebuilders make a point of taking a lot of
time to repair and return the engine, precisely to discourage being taken up
on the warranty. And if the buyer has wisened up, he may realize that it's
not a good idea to trust a repair to a rebuilder who wasn't able or willing
to build a durable engine in the first place. To top it all, there is always
the risk that the rebuilder may decide he is not responsible for the failure
(and sometimes he may actually be right) and will charge you for the repair.
(He has your engine, hence you by the short'n-curlies, so don't count on a
bargain, either!) Thus it very often makes sense not to take the rebuilder
up on their warranty. This means that to a large extent, warranties are just
_cheap talk_. And 100,000 miles warranties are too good to be genuine.

Most VW owners are price-sensitive shopper ;)  If charging 10% more for an
engine (reflecting a higher cost of production) leads to more than a 10%
decline in units sold, then total revenue shrinks. So it should be no
surprise that most engines are priced quite low. To then make a profit,
rebuilders have to shave costs.

A few rebuilders will target the wealthier customers, though, and charge
more, hoping that the higher price will signal quality, thereby justifying
itself. Unfortunately, some rogue rebuilders can play the same game without
offering true quality in return. Hence paying more does not guarantee
getting more.

The key is information and hearing from past customers. Fortunately we have
the internet.
