Subject: Re: [T2] engine seal

Try www.busdepot_dot_com and look for part # 411 813 225

&gt;I Have recently acquired a 78 Bus and it is missing the seal &gt;between the
engine compartment and the engine tin.I have &gt;looked at several websites with
Bus parts and can not find this &gt;seal can anyone get a part number for this seal
or a parts &gt;supplier who would carry it and its exact name. I was told i &gt;need
to get it replaced soon or the engine will run hot.  Any help &gt;would be greatly
appreciated.
