Yes, I know, it would be great if we could all just give up all
extraneous possessions, and always be able to find what we need along
our path of life.

REALITY ALERT!

I just spent $7000 resurrecting my '76 Type two. I still need many
parts, and have some extra around. Recently I talked with a member of
this list, and sent him a brake vaccuum unit I had to go tear off of a
junked car. I spent 1.5 hours taking it off, and $9.50 to send it to
him. So far I have gotten squat back except thank yous and promises of
the shipping costs in the mail.

I sent it with hopes of 'good karma' and being part of the 'bus
brotherhood' but have only received feeling like a used idiot in return.
I know this is probably only an isolated incident, but it shapes my
future actions. Hell, I got my bus from a past list member, and he had
no problem concealing the problems with this bus so he could sell it.

So I would not call it profiteering so much, as just not being an open
headed idiot. I wish I was wrong, and will continue to deal with ppl in
as open and trusting a way as I can, but I am afraid we live in a
material world, and most ppl mistake kindness for weakness, and take
whatever advantage they can.
