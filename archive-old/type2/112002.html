&gt; I just pulled the engine on my 78 bus...pilot bearing was desintegrated (sp)
&gt; The only thing left in the crankshaft end is the bearing race. Lots of options
&gt; in pulling this out...torching, cutting, etc. I tried using a slide hammer
&gt; with a angled tip, but no luck cuz the race lip isn't big enough. I know there
&gt; is some kind of special bushing puller tool, but don't have it...any ideas?

There is a special chisel with a point that gets between the outer race
and the gland nut while pushing the race toward the center of the bore.
I've no idea of the name of this chisel, but the one I have works great
for such problems.  It mangles the race, but if it's already trashed...
