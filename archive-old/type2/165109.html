Hi Jamie,

That sounds like a good idea to me.

It sounds like an awesome opportunity for a tech seminar at BOTC. Now  
all I need (nudge nudge) is someone to lead it...

BTW, they have digital micrometers on sale at crappy tire this week;  
somehow I think this would be a good time to pick one up... Product  
#58-6800-4

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; My suggestion to Greg, take the heads apart for inspection.. at the  
&gt; very least lap the valves.. install rings, hone the cylinders,, lap  
&gt; them into the heads, to get rid of the gaskets.. install cylinder  
&gt; base gaskets..
&gt; double check all the specs and re-assemble
&gt; I would CC the heads too... then he will know the specs of that  
&gt; engine,, not just what a book says about it.
&gt; What is a set of rings worth anyway.... my guess was less than $100.00
