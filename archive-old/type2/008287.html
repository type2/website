I dunno about the other questions, but I can do this one.

Run as much as you can from the 2nd battery, keeping essential car
services from the original one (ie. the stock items from the original
battery). I'd recommend you run the stereo, cigar lighter (ie. 12V
socket for accessories) from the 2nd battery, plus all camping
stuff such as lights, fridge, water pump, etc.

3. What circuits run on the axillary battery?  I'd like to run most
circuits from this battery when camping.
