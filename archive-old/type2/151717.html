&gt; Well, as promised, I will have them cheaper - AND better.
&gt; I liked the design of the one shown in the above link (the mounting method
&gt; is absolutely brilliant!), but I had an improvement in mind. So I called the
&gt; manufacturer and asked them to do a minor rework for me. They had a version
&gt; that added a small mesh pouch between the two cup holders for a cell phone.
