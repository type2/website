&gt; I would replace the line traveling from the Servo
&gt; to the Engine, the one with the one way air check 
&gt; in it. I replaced it last month and it took care 
&gt; of some vacuum leaks that I was having. You need 
&gt; the right kind - I bought mine from the dealer for $80 for only a couple of meters, but it's got the scotch guard in it. This replacement stopped my 
&gt; wild idle and hot running


Chris..

How did you diagnose that the servo was bad?  I've got a 71 bus that won't
hold an idle (dies) and runs really hot.  Any idea if the servo mechanism
is the same, i.e. the troubleshooting runs across years?

Should I be clamping the vacuum line in various places as it runs to the
front of the bus to look for leaks?

What are the trouble signs of a bad brake/vacuum servo?

Thanks,

Tom
