Subject: RE: [T2] temperature guage questions?

&gt;We have been driving our rebuilt 78 Transporter now for about a week and
everything is excellent!  After witnessing first
&gt;hand the abuse my cylinder heads took from the overheating caused by the
previous owner (missing engine tin, lack of 
&gt;seal,three inches of dirt, debris and leaves packed into the cooling fins
etc.) I am very interested in installing some sort &gt;of temperature guage
and/or oil pressure guage in order to monitor the running condition of the
motor.  The &quot;dipstick 
&gt;check&quot; doesnt provide me a whole lot of comfort.  I have reviewed the
archives and library, but am still unclear on the 
&gt;best/easiest method of accomplishing this task.  Someone suggests that an
oil pressure guage is all that is needed as it is 
&gt;directly related to temperature.  Is this a safe assumption?  Should I
install a cylinder head temperature guage or an oil 
&gt;temperature guage?  As I am sure there are many options available, I am
very interested in hearing your suggestions.  Thanks 
&gt;in advance!

While there is a direct link between oil pressure and temp, there is a
bigger link between oil pressure and RPMs. I have the oil temp, oil
pressure, and tach.  I would have a problem relying on the oil pressure
becuause the pressure varies so much depending on RPMs. When climbing hills
or long grades the pressure drops due to lower RPMs and higher temps.  It's
hard to know whether your oil pressure is OK unless you know what your temp
is.  I have simply gotten use to my bus's pressure reading at 3,000, 3,500,
3,800 or whatever RPMs.  However, if you try to factor in different temps
then it all becomes too confusing.  Obviously the hotter the oil the lower
the pressure, but how much?  Is the pressure change because of heat or lower
RPMs?  Can this all be calculated and factored in?  Of course, but it's much
easier to just get a oil temp gauge.  I have a pilot's license and sometimes
it's nice to just stop worrying about all the damn gauges and look out the
windows for a while.  I feel the same way about my bus, so it helps to keep
it simple.  Good luck.
