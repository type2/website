Sounds like you've got a bad ground wire, something is drawing down your
current, a loose or poor ground will do just what you're describing.. I'd
just double ground the engine with a jumper cable to test it.

Feel of the sides of your battery, if they are swolen out it will mean
you have an internal short. Wash your battery top down with baking soda,
a dirty battery can also drain down current.

&gt; My '73 stalls at idle when the headlights and/or heater are on.  It 
&gt; just slowly dies.  Everything is set within specs.  I can't find a 
&gt; vacuum leak.  #1 is down to about 80 psi and little difference is 
&gt; noticed at idle when I disconnect that plug wire, could this be it?  
&gt; It will idle if I kick it up to about 1500 rpm and some difference 
&gt; is noted when I pull #1 wire.  All carb electric's work and there is 
&gt; enough fuel.
&gt; 
&gt; The archive did not help with this one.  Maybe someone has had this 
&gt; exasperating problem and can help.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
