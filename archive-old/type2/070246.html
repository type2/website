&gt; i saw one that said  &quot;fukincrawlin&quot;

I like that...kinda like the one I saw years ago on back of a splittie
[though I think it might have originally been intended in a religious
sense] that said &quot;Powered by hope&quot;.

Also, up here in Canada anyway, School Busses and Gov vehicles have
stickers that say &quot;This vehicle stops at all railway crossings.&quot;, I
have seen one of these on the back of a breadloaf that had been
modified to simply read &quot;This vehicle stops&quot; :)

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!
