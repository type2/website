&gt; &gt;this pod is designed for mounting upright, it probably would not be a

&gt; OK, let me see if I can tell you what the pod is all about.
&gt; The pod is not VDO.

ah I have the VDO pod

&gt; I cannot find a VDO pod, so the pod from the supplier is a 3rd party 
&gt; sourced one that comes in either left or right angled meter mount.

I had heard that the VDO pods were NLA...hope not permanent

&gt; To my mind, but unable to see an actual installation, I sort of thought the 
&gt; pod on the dash would be the way to go.
&gt; 
&gt; Now then, the vendor guy says he does not think I will like the pod being 
&gt; mounted on my dash, so he suggested the upside down scheme.

maybe on a regular car but on the buses we sit up straighter and closer to
the dash.  I don't think a guage under the dash would be very
noticable. mine is on the dash and is in sight but not in the way.

YMMV

&gt; Maybe I should just order both pods, left and right sided configuration 
&gt; mount, so as to be able to make up my own mind upon receipt, and then 
&gt; return the one I decide to not use.

not sure the dealer would like that but why not.   or you could put the
most viewed guages up top and less looked at guages down low.
