&gt; &gt;I'm getting ready to remove my motor. I am planning to purchase an ATV jack.
&gt; &gt;how high does the jack need to lift?
&gt;
&gt; 9-10 inches? I can't remember the exact height but all the jacks I've seen are tall enough.


I use a low profile Hyd transmission jack... it is a little easier to use
(My opinion) and it also tilts and pans which the ATV jacks do not.
little bit more expensive but a lot less hassle.  Harbor Freight has one
for right about $100 when you find a sale.  their manual one is functional
but really needs some umph to get it started.
