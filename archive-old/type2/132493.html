Subject: Bus Tow Bar?

Martin, I'm to far away to let you barrow mine but if you have access to
a Beetle tow bar or any other type of tow bar I can show you how you can
adapt it to the Bus.  The cost for materials to do this is about $20.00.
I used an old tow bar I had to make mine and you can view it at

Let me know,

Kevin





Afternoon all,



I was wondering if anyone in the Washington DC area might have a bus tow
bar I can borrow this/next weekend. I am going to pick up a non-running
bus in VA Beach, and my truck is broke. I'm concerned that my 97 Volvo
wagon might not be able to handle a bus on a tow dolly.  I am willing to
compensate you for your time and inconvience.



Let me know,



Thanks,



Martin Green
