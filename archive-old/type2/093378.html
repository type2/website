Am wondering what this &quot;newness&quot; is all about myself.

Having this past year discovered the width and breadth of &quot;GAAP&quot;,
as in
Generally Accepted Accounting Practices.

I am wondering if the new claims might just be the result of &quot;GAAP&quot;,
as in
Generally Accepted Advertising Practices.

Maybe their response to a well structured technical inquiry might be of 
benefit to the list.
