Subject: Re: How to check Speedometer?

Wiggly at low speed speedo needle is just a cable thing, get the cable lubed,
then if that fails renew it, of course we never will till it breaks.  You can do
the timed speed over a mile and check the calibration of course.  You will also
get everybody telling you to use math (factor the tire size, rear end gears, hey
you need to use a third gear factor maybe, know the rpms or something) maybe it
could be done that way, or just use a machine to spin that wheel in the air
yourself and do a little mark on the tire to count wheel rpms at 30 mph.  But if
you want something to hold up in court, keep trying the speedo shops for a test,
somebody will take your money for that.

&gt; I recently received a ticket from a &quot;local speed trap.&quot; He said 40 I said 30.
&gt; So, I went to the local speedometer test shop and they could not test a VW
&gt; Bus because the cable connects to the front wheel.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone have an idea on how to calibrate the speedometer. Mine does jerk
&gt; around at speeds below 35 mph, then seems to steady out at higher speeds. In
&gt; the freeway I keep up with the other vehicles without a problem. The
&gt; speedometer is usually around 70 during those times.

&gt; Thank-you
