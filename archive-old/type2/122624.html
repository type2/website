Subject: When trannies go bad

I was hoping someone could help me (newbie) diagnose my current problem with
my 1980 T2 Vanagon manual.  When I need reverse, I have a hard time getting
it moving without a series of rapid shudders.  The same for 1st sometimes.
It goes into gear easy enough, but the clutch is very tricky to get to work
right.  From what I've read, the shifting procedure is as follows:

1. clutch all the way to floor
2. shift into gear
3. very little if any gas needed
4. release clutch relatively rapidly
5.  off you go

Mine is tricky, I have to pause on the clutch about 3/4 of the way back up
when I start to move or else I get the shudders and shakes, not any grinding
noise though.  So, I'm longer on the clutch than I feel I should be.  What
makes me think transmission is that its even trickier on a hill.  Maybe just
a clutch adjust though?  Warped flywheel?  Thanks for reading.
