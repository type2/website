&lt;&lt; My rebuilt 1700 w/ duel weber carbs on my 72 westy seems to &quot;skip a beat&quot;

 running, and when you let off the gas quick sometimes.  having the valves
 checked and the carbs synched didn't seem to help, think getting an eletric
 ignition would help?

  &gt;&gt;Just went through the same thing with the wife's 412 station wagon.  It
would pulse at stop lights.  So I went to town on it yesterday, turned out the
old pig still had the original cap and  plug wires!  I'd look into those.  As
for the electronic ignition.  I have a compu fire in my 69' camper.  Seems the
only time I even think about it is when I'm telling someone how great they
are!  There are several ignitions on the market, Pentronic has troubles.
There an arm in there some where that gets broken.  The Compu fire is just a
little box (replaces your points) and a little disc that slips under your
rotor (disc never touches anything-should last forever).  
  Peace, Love, and off to do the push rod tubes seals....ugh!
