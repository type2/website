Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Paint

Would be wise to purchase and check out Bob Hoover's words on the subject/building a T1 in general.  A quick answer, yes everything should/could be painted.  Most certainly jugs need a good coat of flat black, not best to buy flat, better to flatten some good oil based stuff with a bit of gas, you are BRUSHING a thin uniform coat, no spraying.  I tend to sandblast the barrels myself first (with the insides well masked.)  Case needs it as well, your choice, black is fine, the Mg based VW case corrodes like nothing in the world, even sometimes in dry climates.  I guess that a new aluminum replacement case if you were going that way, like T4 cases would be much less prone.  Heads, a bit harder, being aluminum won't go so bad, probably not worth it as attention to detail to get into the fins cleanly is tough and you'd have to conversion coat them (alodine or whatever PPG or whoever will call the alodine they sell you for aluminum prep) first to get any real lasting adhesion, I
 don't bother with heads.  Case and barrels, certainly.
   
  Brings up an aside, does anyone have a good recipe for something to paint the T1 case with that actually simulates that dull grayish silver that a Mg based case will take on over time, for restoration purposes/authenticity this is?  I've tried some flattened metallics with not a lot of sucess in finding the &quot;perfect&quot; looking coating.

  &gt;engines, however, I need advice. I have heard from many to be careful due to
  &gt;the paint &quot;holding in the heat&quot;. Also, some have even gone so far as to say,
  &gt;&quot;stay away from .... color&quot;. What is the advice of this group? Is it safe to
  &gt;paint the engine tin? Can the jugs or block be painted? Any advice would be
  &gt;appreciated.
