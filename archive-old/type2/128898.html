Subject: Re: [T2] How do i get off?

I have lost the &quot;vw bug&quot; and have moved on
to the econoline bug. 


The Ford Beetle. Wouldn't that be a strange little car? It would have gone through many transformations over the years - a Beetle with fins, a Beetle with quad headlights, a big tooth grinning chrome grille in the 50's. 

In the early 70's they would almost certainly have removed the aircooled flat four out backand replaced it upfront (to share chassis and suspension parts with all the other Ford sedan and coupes with an inline 4 banger shared with the Pinto driving through a 3 speed tranny but later detuned it to make no power whatsoever to meet EPA regs. 

The end would be in the 80's when Ford adds a big Techumseh air conditioner compressor to drive the a/c and a half-vinyl covered top, faux convertible top, wire spoke hubcaps to relate the Beetle to the Town Car. 

The same car would be marketed with vinyl graphics, driving lights, chrome exhaust tips, a few fake fiberglass vents, and a garish paint job and vinyl interior to the sporty crowd. 

Same drivetrain, suspension and body sold to both groups, advertising folks stressing different aspects of the same car to sell it to each group... 

In 1985 in a last ditch effort, Ford would stress the Beetle's German roots and all the quality that should entail despite the fact that the Beetle has been built in Dearborn since Ford acquired the VW plant and it's tooling after WWII. 

Finally in the late 90's and early 00's it would return - reborn with scoops and muscular attitude beyond it's past incarnations and would threaten the Corvette and Viper... 

Yeah right... Back to work...

Wonder what a Ford Westfalia (Transporter) would look like?
