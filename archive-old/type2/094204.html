Subject: Re: [T2] fuel filler hoses

Pat, for the bottom right angled hose, I like to use a molded hose you can
buy at most any auto parts store: Gates (E) 70739 is the number, don't know
what it fits, but it is very close to the original, but will need trimmed a=
s
it is longer than stock.  Use your old hose to trim to size.

BTW, if you need the upper hose, Bus Boy's has them:  211-201-119=A0 Filler
Neck Collar and Elbow, Upper, 1974 All, 1975 to 1979 without Catalytic
Converter=A0 $32.90

&gt; Well, I have my first sorta serious problem.  I went to fill the bus yest=
erday
&gt; &amp; fuel came leaking out from the left side.  I am assuming it is one of t=
he
&gt; hoses to the tank.  Maybe both are bad.  I know the top one is available =
from
&gt; Bus Depot but the bottom hose is NLA.  I have searched the archives &amp; bel=
ieve
&gt; that the 2 1/4&quot; ID fuel hose from NAPA will work for both hoses.  Is this
&gt; correct?  Does anyone know how many feet I will need?  I have the microfi=
che
&gt; of the area but it is not really to scale.  This is scary stuff.  I want =
to
&gt; fix this this weekend.
