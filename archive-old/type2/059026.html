All,
   Got report from a friend. He sez he knows where I could pick
up a 1955 TYPE II shell,,i.e. just the body with the glass intact.
no running gear. This is beyond my scope but he claims
it is straight and only surface rust.....If anyone out there is really
interested I will go look at it and maybe get some digital pics.
This jewel is just south of Seattle Wa. and the guy wants
$50.00.
