Subject: Univ of Texas Type2 member...

Im looking for the member of this type2 group who attends The University 
of Texas, is a music major, likes the Grateful Dead, and has their own 
web page with a link to Hoover's gospels. I was checking out your web 
page when I temporarily let a teacher use my station to install software 
on the computer I was at. When she was done, She REBOOTED THE COMPUTER, 
not even botehring to ask me if I was using it (and I am the LAB TECH  
for the classroom!!!!! - HOW DARE SHE!) Man oh man, teachers sometimes....
I want to finish checking out your web page :) could you please look me 
back up and let me know where you are?
Thanks

Chameleon
