Subject: New canvas top

I've got a 71 bus that apparently was modified by a company called
Sportsmobile (this top is called a Penthouse - not sure if all of them
were). When I bought the bus a couple of years ago, I knew I was going
to rebuild the engine and replace the tent. No problem with the engine -
1641CC, Engle cam, balanced crank and rods, progressive carb - runs easy
and strong. The problem I have is trying to find a replacement canvas
tent for it. I know I can get one custom made at a custom price. Even
tho Sportsmobile is still in business and makes whole vehicles now, the
tops still look similar. Does any have a company name of a place that
has them. I'm not interested in a used one - only new. Also, am I
missing something about keeping this fiberglas top up. It seems to very
top heavy and I could never trust it without some additional supports
than what it apparently has. Any body have and ideas. Tom
