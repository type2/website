Marvin,

I thought the first thing you need to do is any adjustment at the handle.
Then at the wheels, then back at the handle.  A well adjusted e-brake should
click 5-6 times at most.  Ask me how I know...having the handle click past
the last rachet will have you cursing your e-brake for quite some time!

Marvin,

     Sounds like a brake adjustment is in order.  First adjust the shoes at
each rear wheel &amp; then try the parking brake.  If they still take more then
6 clicks then the parking brake needs adjusting.  Follow Muir's
instructions.
