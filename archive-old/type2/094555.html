Subject: Buses Of the Corn Trip Report (Long)

Hi Volks,

It's late, but it's done. My Buses Of The Corn trip report is now 
complete. If you want to skip my epic prose and just gawk at the 
pictures go straight to the website at 
http://www.geocities_dot_com/busesofthecorn.

...And now on to the report!

I would like to report that the 2nd annual &quot;Buses Of The Corn&quot; is now a 
week behind us. BOTC went off extremely well and a good time was had by 
all. The weather was terrific, marred only slightly by a quick 
thunderstorm on Friday afternoon, otherwise it was dry and very warm.

39 Buses came in from all points of the compass. The long distance award 
went to Jared Roberts of New Hampshire, who travelled 800 miles to join 
us in his 67 westy. Other campers came in from West Virginia (the Auch 
Family), Michigan (Ina Deneau and Dave Winne), Cornwall, Ontario and 
some from Quebec as well. Along with the buses were 2 A/C beetles and 
two New Beetles, with one NB hauling in the 200 cobs of corn that fed 
the crowd their Saturday evening corn-roast. This is more than double 
the attendance from last year's event and a sure sign that Buses Of the 
Corn has become an event of its own and not just a stop on the way to 
the Great Canadian Bug Show.

One of the best features of BOTC is the location. Heber Down 
Conservation area is very close to Whitby, Ontario; and puts campers 
only minutes away from fuel, camping supplies and all the urban 
amenities. But it's also well away from the beaten path, Lyndebrook Rd 
is at least a mile North from the Taunton Rd  and then the gravel entry 
road comes at least half that far south again. The surrounding area is 
all undeveloped conservation area lands. We're well isolated from nosy 
on-lookers and the campground quickly evolves into its own little world. 
A world of buses, and bus-folk. Heaven, kinda.

Friday:

At certain times on Friday I felt like I was Radar from M*A*S*H. 
Suddenly my ears would perk up and I'd tell whoever was nearest 
&quot;incoming&quot;; they'd listen a minute and tell me I was wrong. Sure enough, 
3 to 5 minutes later the buses would come rolling down the road into 
camp. Folks started rolling in about 1:30 PM Friday and the buses 
continued to arrive for another 12 hours. The group would welcome them 
in to dinner or up to the fire and the intros would begin another round.

Saturday:

The BOTC events were the best part this year. As soon as I discovered 
the Great Canadian Bug Show was going to be a Sunday-only event I knew 
we would need something to keep people occupied. Except I had no idea 
whether people would be motivated to follow through with such crazy 
concepts. We started off on Saturday morning with The Full Moon Bus 
Club's &quot;Breakfast Burritos&quot;. That one is a proven winner. Although the 
Burrito experience was new to most people attending there were enough 
EveryBus/BusFusion veterans present to get things happening smoothly. 
The organized pandemonium was an excellent beginning; there were plenty 
of contributions and lots of teamwork. You simply can't find a better 
way to start the day.

After breakfast was cleaned up people gathered for Kendrew Pape's  
&quot;Camping Competition&quot;, where contestants competed against the clock to 
demonstrate their Mad Camping Skillz. Beginning from a rolling start the 
stop-watch was triggered the instant the buses wheels stopped rolling. 
They were then required to set up their bus to sit down and relax with a 
beverage. Then it was time for a meal, so they had to set up a table and 
eat or drink something. Next they needed to set up for bedtime, and lay 
down until their head hit their pillow. Finally, the bus had to be 
returned to travelling condition and the stop-watch was finally switched 
off as their wheels turned again. With Kendrew's lively colour 
commentary the event drew a large crowd, who were all amazed by Larry 
Johnston's blistering 34-second run. Way to go Larry!!

The next event on tap was Frisbee golf. The meadow adjacent to the 
camping area proved perfect for a 9-hole frisbee golf course and the 
weather co-operated with a dry and not too windy day. The top scores all 
came in in the low 30-s. Winner of this event was Dave Ireland, with an 
awesome 6 under par 30-stroke finish.

After lunch we gathered at 1:30 for the Driving Skillz Competition. This 
event was co-ordinated by Adam Narraway. The course was a timed run 
across a field with a serpentine course marked out with water balloons. 
Popping a marker balloon added to the points score. The course started 
from a standing start and went through the S-bends to stop the driver as 
close to a marker pole as possible. Then a measurement was made to see 
how close they could get without touching it. Next they went back 
through the course the way they came.... but in reverse, of course. 
Thereverse slalom ended at the LumberJack parking...  we all watched on 
in horror as the driver attempts to park as close to a cardboard mock 
palm tree as possible without hitting it. Another measurement is taken 
and the driver is then sent off to parallel park the bus using picnic 
tables as the other cars. Kenrew's bus only backed into the tables a few 
times; Phil Gowdy generously volunteered a spare turn signal lens and 
all was well.

This event drew a bigger crowd than the Camping Skills and had over 20 
competitors. Some  drove their own buses but most opted to try their 
hand with Kendrew Pape's 78 Automatic 7-passenger bus &quot;Buster&quot;. Kendrew 
was very gracious to share his ride with the group and didn't even 
flinch when someone asked Adam if there would be a penalty for rolling 
it. I drove buster on my run through the course and was very impressed 
with the accelleration a 2L FI engine can deliver to a non-westy. The 
brakes were good too, as I discovered after scraping myself from the 
windshield after applying the binders coming into the first corner of 
the slalom. Phil Gowdy took first place honours in this event, which was 
highlighted by Kendrew Pape getting the wheels off the ground hitting 
the first set of bumps in the course. Kendrew's 12-foot slide coming 
into the first pole was pretty impressive as well. But Phil's accuracy 
won the day and I was surprised to later learn that I came in second. I 
think Phil may have had an advantage through the slalom by having his 
kids aboard... they added ballast and smoothed his ride through the 
bumps.

After the Driving Skillz, there was an unscheduled and very welcome 
water balloon fight followed by the kids scavenger hunt. Then the 
shucking started in earnest and soon the corn pots were brought to a 
boil. Fresh picked that very morning, the corn was succulent and sweet, 
and everyone had plenty to go along with the awesome array of side 
dishes and desserts that people brought to share. Watermelon, fruit 
cocktail cake, chili, salads... something for everyone and absolutely 
no-one went hungry. We also sang Happy Birthday to Ina Deneau, who 
arrived early (Even before I did!!) at the event in her Vanagon Westy.

After dinner the gang regrouped at 8 PM for the awards ceremony. First 
the sponsors were thanked and the event prizes were awarded, then we 
heard about the 2003 Isles de Madelienes event being organized by the 
IWCCC. They're planning a week-long event out in the middle of the 
Atlantic  in an attempt to break their own Guinness World Record. Frank 
also told us about BusFusion, which is the campout he organizes in 
Almonte Ontario. Jamie Rivers was on next, he told us about &quot;The Bug 
Pack&quot; and raised the suggestion of an upcoming &quot;Backbone of Ontario&quot; 
fall colours tour. Then it was time to divvy up the remaining door 
prizes; everything from a &quot;Winter Driving Kit&quot; (Socks and mittens 
knitted by my mom) to deer whistles to the Special Edition BOTC Alarm 
Clocks. Sebastien Laplante also brought a great selection of goodies 
from Tenaquip, a Quebec-based Industrial tool-supply company that he 
works for. Thanks, Sebastien!

Soon after the official ceremonies dispersed people regrouped around the 
campfire, and many hours of friendly chat followed. I left the campfire 
at about 1:30 and by then pretty much everyone had already gone off to 
bed.

Next morning started early as the vendors packed up to roll out to the 
Great Canadian, about 8 buses headed out on the 9AM Carabus, and the 
rest dribbled out in fits and starts until about 11AM. I looked around 
and they were all gone, and not a trace of their passing was left. What 
an excellent way to say thanks; I was very impressed. There wasn't a 
single person there I wouldn't be glad to camp with anywhere.

I had a great weekend, and I'd like to thank everyone who came out, with 
a special thanks to my event co-ordinators (Adam Narraway, Collie 
Corner, Eric Fischer, Kendrew Pape and Vicki Rivers), my wife Colleen 
(&quot;Couldn't have done it without You, love&quot;), my parents Gord and 
Margaret Potts, My brother Martin and also to Laur Corner who did a 
great job chasing down loose ends and bringing in 200 cobs of corn in 
her New Beetle. THANKS, YOU GUYS ROCK!!!!

A few things to work on for next year include improving the water 
supply, Not inviting the mosquitos, and just leaving Sunday open for 
people to use as they please.

Already I'm looking forward to Buses Of the Corn 2003.

Happy trails,
