&gt;&gt;&gt;Exhaust wrapping is fiberglass-mesh webbing, approximately 3
millimeters
thick, and about 6 centimeters wide. It is applied by moistening the
mesh, then wrapping the exhaust spiral fashion. The webbing hardens into
a chrysalis around the pipes.



Dont do this ask Dave Jersey.
When he was down a year or so back he had thought he'd blown something in
the Burrito Express. Turned out that the muffler he had wrapped completely
corroded out the pipes under the wrap and in a fairly short span of time.
He suffered the pains of wedging an Ill-fitting aftermarket extractor in
the parking lot of the studio in the rain.
