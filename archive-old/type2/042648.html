Subject: Gearbox confusion (Was engine from '79-&gt;'73).

Hi,
	You can do this- David Schwarze has a '73 with a late engine in it,
IIRC,
David, are you following this?

 From the library (David again):

+---
The 091 trannies started in 76 in the US. At this time my best guess is that
sometime in 74 they changed from 5.375 to 4.86, still in the 002 case. In 76
they started with the 4.57 and the 091 case.
The 75 case was one year only, 002 number but with 091 style ribs on it. 

This is one area where the Bentley appears to be a poor source of
information.
You really can't be sure what you've got until you open it up and look. You 
can just make an educated guess. 
+---

 I have a theory that one source of the confusion is that VW changed the way
they set up the gearing between upright and pancake engined busses as the 
torque from the pancakes increased. Initially (~72-73) the pancake engines
had a higher top gear and the same final drive as the uprights but then as
the 091 transmission was introduced and the low end torque of the 2.0l 
pancake increased they simply used a different final drive to &quot;regear&quot; the
091
for the different engines (or for &quot;mountain ratios&quot;).
 I don't have enough data around to check this out- can anyone debunk it?

Cheers,
	 W.
