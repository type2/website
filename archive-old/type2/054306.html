Subject: Re: unusual type2 engine number

&gt;the number on my engine case is different from any other bay type2:
&gt;w 019912 G
&gt;two other things around the number: 1) it begins with a small vw stamp,
&gt;with a clockwise arrow around it; and 2) there is  -4 above the space
&gt;between &quot;2&quot; and &quot;G&quot;
&gt;
&gt;can anyone identify it?


thanks list! it seems to be a factory rebuilt type4 1700 from the early
70's. ver-r-r-y different timing, my friends, which is what i was after in
the short run.

steve - wanting comments about the tiico 2.0 rebuilds from south africa
that were posted to the list last week?
