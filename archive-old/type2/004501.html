Subject: Westy Light Switches- '68-7x?
Message-ID: &lt;006101bf20b8$f9ba4a30$5654a980_at_gispc7.prg.utk_dot_edu&gt;

Sent this a few weeks back, I never saw it come through.  So here I go
again.

_________________________________________________________


The light assembly that I'm referring to has three bulbs within, two
switches (one with a blue trim ring, one with red), and a grey rubber base.
It is mounted above the swing-out table in my '69 Westfalia.

One of my switches has fried.

The one on the light that makes the two outboard bulbs fire is fine, but the
one that works the single center bulb in the assembly is shot.  As far as I
can tell, these two switches are identical.

I don't see any mention of this switch in parts catalogs, nor any mention of
the assembly itself.

The little rectangular box-like switch has a Bosch symbol and part number on
the side, but I can't find a replacement.

Anyone have a source?

Searching for the Grail,
