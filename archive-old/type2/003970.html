Easiest way is with an engine scope. On display or raster, watch the pattern
when the points open. If it is more than 3 degrees off, dist is worn out.
Lacking a scope, you can measure the point gap each time they open. If they are
even, then the lobes are decent. You can measure the gap and then try to move
the shaft towards the point rubbing block. Hold it with pressure and measure the
gap again. If it increases, shaft/bushings are worn.


&gt; I'm sure this can't be too tough a question. How do you
&gt; determine if a dizzy is worn out? I think it has
&gt; something to do with excessive freeplay but I'm not sure
&gt; exactly where.
