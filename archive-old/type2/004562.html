&gt;
&gt; Can any one tell me, in which back issues of Dune Buggies &amp; Hot VWs, did
the
&gt; various articles about &quot;Project Westfalia&quot; appear.
&gt;
&gt; I am interested to find out, what was covered in these articles.
&gt;
&gt; There was a passing mention of them, at least three years ago, in a
website
&gt; regarding the Wayback Machine, belonging to someone by the name of Scott,
&gt; but I cannot find the URL.
&gt;
&gt; Scott had fitted some homemade air intake duct extensions, which he
claimed,
&gt; improved his engine cooling, so I would like to find out more about them.
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas folks?
&gt;
&gt; Regards.
&gt;         Nigel A. Skeet
