Thanks to everyone who replyed giving me some suggestions...

Im thinking it may have been the FI connection.. the little clips that hold 
it tight are gone and its been trying to stay in place with zip ties but it 
slipped off... I did try pressing it tight into place earlier but that didnt 
seem to help at the time, so im reluctant to say thats what it was... oh 
well, im crossing my fingers and driving back to san francisco now... I have 
faith! (i have faith right? heh)

If all goes well, ill go check out the old volks show n shine event tomorrow 
back here in san meteo... if not I may have to take the vw GT* instead.

learning as I go...
