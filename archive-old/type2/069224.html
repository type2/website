Subject: Removing door pannels

Does anyone know any tricks for removing door panels. I have to fix the
window crank and I'm not sure how to get the door panel on and off. I
have pried some of the clips out but I don't see how to get the door
handle and the window crank handle off. Any help would be most
appreciated.

Also where is a good place to get replacement parts should I screw
something up, like a new door panel, clips, whatever is broken in the
window mechanism, etc.?
