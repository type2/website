Subject: Thanks from the friend with an electrical question

Thanks to all who replied to my last post about the guy who now owns my old 66 and had NO electrical power.  You all were right on the money (but of course!) Seems that the wire going to the starter from the battery had come loose and was loosing contact.  He tightened everything up and his new '66 is back in business. Plus it makes me look like less of a heel, being that it was a minor thing, because I PROMISED him when we made the trade that the bus was VERY reliable and NEVER gave me an ounce of trouble (and that's the truth!)  Thanks!



Peace, John Baker
