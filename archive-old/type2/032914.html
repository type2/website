Subject: Rear shocks

Volks,

   I purchased new shocks all the way around and started to install rears. 
Mine are , like most I assume, spring over the shock. I compressed the spring 
, removed spring attachment holder on shock and then noticed the other shock 
has no place to attach the device that holds the spring in place to the 
shock.  I assume I have the wrong shocks or are these superstar shocks and 
you dont need the spring???
