Subject: Re: cooling system for 78 Westy

Thanks there.  I think I have all the necessary tins, my S.O. just doesn't 
think I should spend the time to put them back on after replacing the push 
rod tube seals.  Thanks everyone for your support!!!!   I've been working 
hard on keeping my 78 Westy STOCK and now I can do it with confidence  (LMAO).
