&gt; - Turkey Dinner, (deep-fried on the campsite): This was a challenge.
&gt; I really enjoy Thanksgiving, and since JBB was moved up a week this
&gt; year I was going to miss it if I didn't bring it with me. So we held
&gt; a Canadian Thanksgiving at JBB. Jeff brought the birds, Sharon

and if this is a sample of Canadian thanksgivings, I'm becoming Canadian
(at least one weekend a year anyway)

&gt; brought the peanut oil and my Dad and I brought the cookers. Everyone
&gt; who came brought a side dish, and chipped in a few bucks towards the
&gt; turkey and oil. So many excellent side dishes were brought along that
&gt; it was impossible to taste them all on one plate. Did you know that
&gt; sauerkraut is traditionally served with turkey in Maryland... Who'da

you mean everyone doesn't have saurkraut with thanksgiving???

&gt; thunk it? It took less than an hour to cook two 15lb birds and we fed
&gt; about 35 people in total.

and boy was it good,,,.!!! my stomach still thanks you

&gt; Many thanks to Jeff Stewart and Sharon Simpson for putting on a great
&gt; event.

here  here !!

&gt; Pics will be posted soon.... There are some other peoples
&gt; shots already online at www.fullmoonbusclub_dot_com.

old fashion I am, mine are still on film in the camera...


glad you guys could make it, next year better weather, or we get new
weather guys on TV..

Bob
