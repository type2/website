&gt; If you want credit for search and rescue, you've got to find and save
&gt; something at risk.
&gt;       There still IS some romance to finding and maintaining old
&gt; vehicles, but the world of old vehicle collectors and maintainers
&gt; is full of people buying and selling amongst each other. I really
&gt; wanted there to be an Aircooled Search And Rescue Team too. Oh well.
&gt;
Rest assured that the Search and Rescue Team is alive and well. Some missions
are a lot easier than others, and might not even count as rescues. In defense
of the Team however, consider the condition of my current '67. It was sitting
in a field since 1981. I proceeded to rescue it, and have replaced almost
everything, and driven it halfway across the country.
I'm looking into a lot of 7 Beetles, some dating back to '63, that are sitting
in a field of a farm. They've been sitting since the early eighties all the way
up to the most recent deposit, 1989.
 Granted this may not be a true rescue, but it is, at the very least a
wonderful adventure. This is also not a vehicle for my collection, but for me
to use as a truck. I understand that there are collectors who swap vehicles as
an expensive hobby. I have been involved in several trades, but always with
daily-driver or worse type vehicles, and that was just because I was confused
as to what kind of bus I wanted, since I realistically can't have a huge
assortment.
 I am sorry that you seem to be disillusioned by the &quot;ease&quot; of this adventure.
I hope you won't write off the Search and Rescue idea because of it. I thought
I was tapping into the spirit and love of VW's that so many of us have. I have
accompanied several friends on &quot;rescues&quot;. Granted, some aren't as in depth as
my saving my current bus, but I love the adventure of helping someone find
their bus. Even if it is running perfectly, and wouldn't go to the crusher,
there's still some romance in finding that perfect vehicle for someone. I'm
sorry this adventure doesn't qualify as a real rescue, but I promise to do
better the next time!
:)
I do know of a 50's panel van that the owner will trade for a proper storage
shed...
And with that, I am out the door, to bring home the Bus.
:)
HAppy Friday all, and enjoy those VW's no matter what the condition may be!
