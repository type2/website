Subject: [T2] e-brake fixed

Thanks for all the suggestions, it ended up being the horse shoe clip broke 
off. So I but in a bolt with two nuts to hold it on ( this is what my 
mechanic did to the other side). Hopefully it will hold for a few years. But 
I still don't know where that nut in the other side came from. Oh well, at 
least I learned you don't have to take off the axle nut to get to the brakes 
!! Thanks again for all the help.
