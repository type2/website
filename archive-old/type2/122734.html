Subject: Re: [T2] 69 campmobile transport and dimensions

On Thu, 11 Mar 2004 20:46:01 -0700 
Karen I. Eblen said something about [T2] 69 campmobile transport and dimensions:

&gt; my 69 has been sitting at my dear ol' mom's in Texas for too long and 
&gt; although I've managed to keep it up and running with several visits, I'm 
&gt; nervous about driving it back to Boulder. 

Heh. 2 Augusts ago I bought a '74 *PARTS BUS*, rusted and beat up, in
Boulder for $265. I drove it to the RMMW show, let the kids use it as the
&quot;paint bus&quot;, drove it up to Bandimere, then drove it home to Texas -- WAY
on the other side of Texas (Port Arthur area). Blew out a plug part way
back but that's the only problem I had. Still have all the glass, the
pop-top (soon to be tossed as it's just taking up {LOTS OF} space), seats,
and motor (now dead, but I drove on it for 6 months or so).

What is your &quot;daily driver&quot; there in Boulder? Perhaps you could buy/borrow
a tow bar and just tow it home. I bought a '73 Riviera camper in Concord,
CA in January and towed it back to Texas that way (with a weekend stop at
BBB-8). Roughly 2000 miles one way.
