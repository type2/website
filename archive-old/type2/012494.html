Subject: 914 Race Prepped case, neat.
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

I bought a 914 case off ebay recently that was prepped in the
early 80's for SCCA racing and thought I'd tell a little bit about
the thing as it is way cool.

First it shuffle pinned on all main webs, pretty standard thought,
but then it had the through case bolt holes line drilled out to 1/2&quot;
and tight slip fit through bolts carved out of grade 10, 5/8&quot; bolts.
Alignment seems to be real important for this thing, of course
the T4 being the ultimate high revving machine stock as it is,
I can't imagine why they went to the trouble 8-)
Align bored 0.020 after all this of course.

It really gets neat from there, instead of just tapping and plugging
all the oil galleys, most of them were first enlarged, then TIG welded
shut.  Sort of an annoyance as I don't know how I'll clean it, will
probably have to drill through and tap the flywheel ends.  The oil
pickup was TIG'ed up as well, and the case is plumbed with a
scavenge plate for dry sumping.  This is real bizzare as they flycut
out the stock T4 sump plate area to use a T1 bolt pattern style
plate.  Guess no real way to mount a scavenge plate with the stock
setup when you look at it.

The plain coolest thing though is the fact that all the main bearing
webs are carved back, clearanced, and polished to clear a billet
SCAT crank he ran, shame he sold it years ago.  Then to boot,
and this is beyond neat they installed piston squirters in the webs
to spray down the back of the pistons.  It is hard to describe how
they supply them, but real cool.  They ground tiny oil channels
behind the main bearings up to holes cross drilled through the
webs then peened a steel plug with a tiny squirter hole down the
cross drill.

They also massively enarged the oil passage from where the little
plate mounts on the rear passenger side, into the main sump for
some reason, polishes the sump inside, welded shut the oil drain,
and did a bunch of other detail stuff.

It is all based on a 914 style case without the oil fill in the rear
and oddly I had not realized before not really modifiable to take the
bus oil fill, which isn't an issue with the dry sump.  Has the 914
and vanagon location dipstick, plugged of course.  It is a dual relief
style case without the pocket on the oil intake, long pickup style.
I also never realized how many detail changes there are in the casting
of the early case, a lot of the webbing here and there is different,
different even from the last 1700 bus case I had.  This thing is
probably 411/412/early 914 vintage though.

Anyway, they guy had about $1500 into the case in the mid 80's and
I gave $200 for it, 2 914 baffle plates, a dented CB Performance style
dry sump tank, and a nice set of rocker shafts, so I'm tickled to death.
I'm unsure if I'll build the Stephens engine back into this thing or not
as the CB Performance dry sump pump uses the stock pickup, but
I do really like the piston squirters and the 1/2&quot; through bolts so I
may just add em to a good stock case.  It is a neat piece though,
it seems that even FAT and Ollies who did this thing in the day no
longer do this sort of stuff to a T4.
