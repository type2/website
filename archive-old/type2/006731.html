The double foil insulation that I mentioned buying from Lowe's has bubbled
plastic between the layers of foil, not felt like Whitney's.  This plastic
bubble material is somewhat like the plastic bubble packing material
except it is denser (I cannot pop the bubbles by standing on the insulation).
Now I need some opinions (are you there Matthew).  I have heard from a list
member who put his Whitney insulation down with the foil against the metal
and it caused condensation between the foil and the metal of the van.  Since
my insulation is foil on both sides, will it cause me a condensation problem?
I can put vapor barrier over the insulation in the side panels, but do not
feel that I can effectively seal the whole floor area and perhaps not the
roof area.  Should I throw away my double foil insulation and order the single
foil from JC Whitney?  My panels are not rusted on the inside now, and I
would hate to create a problem that I don't have now, by installing the 
insulation.  I am soliciting advice/opinions.  Thanks.
