Subject: Anybody Have These?

I need the two lower cooling tins that go between the heater boxes and the 
case for a '73 1700.
If anyone has these please let me know. I can't find anyone who has them. 
Unfortunately there are no Pick-A-Part type places around me that have any 
Buses, pretty rare if you ever find one around here. Are there any scavenger 
hunters out there?

Parts R and W under the Engine Tin Section listed below.

Thanks,
