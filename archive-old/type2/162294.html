Subject: Re: [T2] More Insurance Questions 

Ray,

Thanks bunches...I figured you would chime in here.

The only difference is that I had to provide an appraisal
to Farmers at the same time they did the insurance.

That says to me that if the bus is &quot;totaled&quot; then I *will* 
get the agreed on &quot;appraised&quot; value.
I did read the link on &quot;insurable interest&quot;, but I am off the hook since I 
paid for an up-front appraisal at the time the policy was taken out.


The charges for this are less than a new car, but more than just the 
liablilty that I pay on some of my other VW's.

Oh, and for the few times that I have ever had to deal with a claim(less 
than 3 times in 30+ years), Farmers was up front and IMHO *very* 
fair....oh, and very fast as well.

Of course, my agent loves me...4 cars(down from 6) + wife has 3)...LOL!


Cheers, dave

&gt; different things.  But the value of your vehicle
&gt; is the value of your vehicle.  You will need
&gt; evidence to back up that value, either at the
&gt; time of the claim or when you are trying to pay
&gt; more for an agreed value.  
&gt; 
&gt; There is no reason to pay more for agreed value. 
&gt; Either your vehicle is worth a certain amount or
&gt; it is not.  EVEN if you have an agreed value
&gt; policy of say $20,000 on a $2000 bus, YOU WILL
&gt; ONLY GET $2000.  Period.  I posted in the
&gt; archives about the concept of &quot;insurable
&gt; interest&quot;.  Check it out if you have any
&gt; questions.  If you bus is worth $20000 and you
&gt; buy a normal policy, you will get the value of
&gt; the vehicle.  
&gt; 
&gt; Agreed value is the &quot;whole life&quot; of auto
&gt; insurance.  Insurers sell it, but no educated
&gt; consumer would buy it.  
&gt; 
&gt; Shark, the fact that you have an &quot;agreed value&quot;
&gt; vis-a-vis your insurer has nothing to do with
&gt; damages that a tortfeasor owes to you.
