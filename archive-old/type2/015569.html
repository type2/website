&gt;Volks,
&gt;	Anyone know what I'm looking at here? I need a rebuild kit. Will the

&gt;the parts store?

So far as I know, all Solexes are marked with their modle number. Pull it
off of there, clean the exterior. On the edge of the baseplate you might
find stamped modle numbers, but some Solexes only have the model number
cast into the body. 

I would never try to even start an engine that sat for 8 years without
rebuilding/replacing the carburator first, change the oil, check the valve
lash which will verify that the motor will turn (squirt some lube in the
cylinders before to attempt to turn it), clean or replace the battery and
cables, drain the old gas, blow out the fuel lines, replace the hoses and
filter, verify ignition stuff and change the oil/filter. Only then are you
ready to crank it over with the starter with the plugs out until oil
pressure is established. Now do a compression test. The first few
revolutions with rust scale involved could mean it is foolish to go further
without pulling the cylinders.

You can have some time then to figure out what to do about fuel delivery.
If you have a mechanical pump, for sur it is toast or won't make 50 miles
before it leaks. If you have an electric pump, get a mechanical pump. 

Got the motor running??? Good. Now pump the brake pedal several times and
if it comes up firm, press on it as HARD AS YOU CAN. If something is going
to pop, you want to know before your engage the clutch. Even if it is firm
and holds, no that you have very real safety concerns with the brakes on
anything that sits more than 2 years if you have much humidity around and
at 8 years I wouldn't trust non used brakes even in Pheonix where it's bone
dry always. 

This is the reality of making these long sitting vehicles functional again,
but I think it's worth it. It might actually cost 3 or 5 or 7 grand to
resurrect a Bus, but have you seen the price of a new EVan or even a New
Beattle??? Half price or less for safe and dependable transportation works
for me.

Just know that fixing your carb is just one of many steps you must address
before you have a reasonably safe vehicle to drive.
