Subject: Re: [T2] Driver side sliding door??

Hiya Rob,

Insofar as production goes, VW was (is?) a rabid supporter of the &quot;one size 
fits all&quot; philosophy.  So, all Busses, left hand drive or right hand drive, got 
the tracks on both sides.  In 99% of those Busses only one track was ever 
used.  But there were a few double sliding door models made.  IIRC most of those 
Busses were European models.
