&gt; How do I remove the cosmoline from my new engine case without damage to
&gt; the case?


I just ran into this same problem a couple of months ago.
The consensus was that you should use clean kerosene
and let it soak on there for a few minutes. Soap or 
non-solvent degreasers dont seem to be able to touch it.

BTW, the gold-green color of the case will prob. stay. The
cosmolene kind of 'stains' the metal. Fine sand paper will take
it off, but I am not that crazy.

Good luck!
(Nothing like a nice, new, shiny engine case to brighten your day...)
