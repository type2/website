Hey Volks,

About once a year I like to poll the list and find out what people are
using for keeping track of gas mileage, repairs, oil changes, etc. on
their bus. 

I've been using an Excel spreadsheet for a few years, and over time I've
added way too many metrics that I've put into it. So much so, that it's
become like one of those grossly bloated Swiss Army knives (the really
big ones with compressor, wind gauge, telephone and small satellite dish
built in). I mean, hey do I really need to know what my energy
consumption is in joules? ;-)

Just kind of curious, what, if anything, are you using?

me to do bad things. Other times they
just say , &quot;Man, these fries would
be good with ketchup!&quot;
