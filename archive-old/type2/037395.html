Subject: Re: VDO tachometer problem

Thanks Sean Bartnik for your thoughts.

But I should make something clear.
I have manual transmission and off course the engine does not have a
variation like this. The engine runs very stable and nicely. The speedometer
also shows no variation! But the tachometer shows this large variation,
which is quite large in my opinion.
I guess that if I change the coil to a more powerful one (new), the
variation should be less? What do you think?

&gt; &gt; Maybe some experienced people could help me out here!
&gt; &gt; I put in a VDO tachometer and it works.
&gt;
&gt; Not necessarily.  If you are having that much variation in rpm at 60 mph,
&gt; and you have a manual transmission, then you have a problem with either
the
&gt; tachometer or the speedometer.  There's no way that the engine can vary in
&gt; rpm that much at a constant speed.  Remember that the engine and
&gt; transmission are locked together mechanically (this is called the clutch).
&gt; If you are going 60 mph, the engine rpm will always be the same (assuming
&gt; you keep the same tires, same gearing in the transmission, etc).  So
&gt; therefore your variability is either in the tachometer or the speedometer,
&gt; i.e. the tachometer is not reporting the correct rpm all the time or the
&gt; speedometer is not reporting the correct speed all the time.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I got a 74 2L carb.
&gt; &gt; The only thing which needs some attention is that the rmp vary a lot
when
&gt; &gt; driving at a constant speed. If I drive around 60mph the tachometer
shows
&gt; &gt; around 4000rpm in 4th gear! Is this correct and schould it be like this,
&gt; or
&gt; &gt; is this too high?
&gt;
&gt; On a '74 that might be normal.  I think the '74 transmission had lower
&gt; gearing than the later ones because the '74 originally came with the 1.8L
&gt; engine as opposed to the 2.0L.  My '79 2.0L runs close to 3500 rpm at an
&gt; indicated 65 mph or so, but I am unsure as to the accuracy of the
&gt; speedometer.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; And at this constant speed the variation can be from 3800rmp till
&gt; 4200rmp..
&gt; &gt; I think that's a big variation!
&gt;
&gt; If your Bus is an automatic, then I'd say it's possible.  Remember that an
&gt; automatic has no direct mechanical linkage between the engine and
&gt; transmission, rather there is a fluid coupling called the torque
converter.
&gt; So depending on conditions, the engine rpm may fluctuate even though you
are
&gt; driving at a constant speed.  This is of course assuming the Bus automatic
&gt; transmission does not have a lockup torque converter, and I don't think it
&gt; does.  Correct me if I'm wrong, auto tranny gurus.
