Subject: Re: [T2] what about roof top AC?
Cc: &lt;type2_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

&gt;I started wondering what that box was thats on top of all RVs. Once i
&gt;found out it was AC i thought, why can't i have one of those for my
&gt;77 Riviera camper. Turns out they run on A/C so you'll need a generator
&gt;too, but they do have optional heat too. They are pricy ~ $600 for unit
&gt;plus ~ $400 for a generator, but can you put a price on comfort. And they
&gt;even worked with the motor stopped.
&gt;
&gt;I was wondering if any has tried this. If my Riviera pop top could hold
&gt;75lbs, or if i could remove the front 'glass part and put it there, right
&gt;above the front seats. And make some kind of rear bumper mount for the
&gt;generator.

Really funny you should mention this Eli.  I am putting together all the
parts to put an electric air in my '76 westy with the generator mounted on
the front under a Coca Cola metal box (of course the bottom and back are
cut out and I think I will louvier the front).  You're right, the AC can
run all the time, even while you are grabbing a burger.  Then when you get
to the campground, plug in the AC and shut down the generator.  In the
winter, just remove the generator.

I was going to put the electric compressor in the engine compartment on the
left, the condensers under the bus and the evaportor under the dash.

Now a friend of mine, Jeff Adams &lt;jadamsx4_at_email.msn_dot_com&gt; is doing just
what you discribed to the exact same bus!!  He has found one of the roof
top mounted units used, but has taken off the cover and is going to put
something a bit more presentable on top.  Drop him an email and he only
lives in KC, so maybe you could drop by when you go to the MoKan show on
June 2.
