Subject: Running FI Out of Bus, Testing

Connections for the left side of the Double Relay: Since the harness for 
this side stays in the bus and you don't have a spare try this with wires 
and appropriate connectors.

88d to + side of Fuel Pump.
86c to + side of Coil.
88z to #30 on Starter. Also you need a jumper between 88y and 88z.
85  to Ground, you can use the same Ground for the - side of the Fuel Pump.
86a to #50 on the starter.

For the questions earlier yesterday, this may help or cause flames from the 
Gods of the List. Maybe a smalll debate, since some are interested in a test 
stand others are convinced that it will not work running the FI out of the 
engine.

+ side of Battery to the #30 on the starter.
- side of Battery to ground, bellhousing has a few good grounding locations.
Run a wire between the + side of the battery to the + side of the Coil, put 
a toggle switch in that line to turn on the power and to shutdown the engine 
when you get it going.
Run a jumper between the #30 and the #50 on the starter. Here you definately 
want a switch. One that is a trigger type that only makes contact when 
pressure is applied. Most FLAPS carry a starter setup with a trigger and two 
wires with alligator clips on the ends. Very useful even when working on 
your bus with the engine in. No more running back to the front to turn the 
key.

Aslong as you block and or make the proper connections to alleviate vacuum 
leaks then you should be okay.
