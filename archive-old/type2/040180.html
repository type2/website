Subject: =?ISO-8859-1?B?3A==?=ber-Kamper survives first highway run!

Hi Volks,
 
Just thought I'd drop y'all a line to mention that the motor is now in the
Über-Kamper and it has survived it's first run. 60 miles from Erin to
Scarborough, 97% highway driving between 50 - 70 MPH. Since we didn't have
time to replace the fuel tank, I drove it home with the motor slurping from
a 5-gallon outboard motor tank tied off to the spare tire well.
 
Dennis  (Aka Denmeister) did a magnificent job of tweaking the engine, and
the fact that there wasn't any camping gear installed yet might also have
affected the acceleration (grin). There is still plenty of work to be done,
but now that it's a running vehicle it'll be a lot easier. The brakes work
way better... No more &quot;ABS&quot; effect from the 73's warped front disk.

A closer look at the motor says that for this season I'll probably configure
the Bus without the pop-top, and put my effort into replacing the muffler,
erspacher furnace and heater boxes instead. The interior wiill get a
full-width Z-bed (ie, no closet) and the rear-facing seat may be replaced
with a pickup-truck style drop-down seat mounted to the wall behind the
driver. That way I can put swivels on both of the front seats. Next year
I'll put in the double-bed pop-top.
 
Stay tuned to www.geocities_dot_com/vw_type2 &lt;http://www.geocities_dot_com/vw_type2&gt;
for more details, I'll try to get an update posted later today.

This weekend's efforts will focus on gas-tank replacement, and removing
stuff from the 73 bus to distribute it  to needy list-members. (You know who
you are...)
 
Happy Friday,
(Made more so by the 3-day weekend we celebrate in Canada)
