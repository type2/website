Troy,

On thing you can do to check out the pressurized side of the fuel system
is this.  Pull the wire off of the positive (+) side of the coil and
tape it up good!!  We don't want any sparks.  This will keep you from
damaging your coil or points.  Next, pull the airbox cover and filter out
but leave the air sensor unit in place and the harness plugged in.  Now,
you can turn on the ignition and when you take a wooden dowel and open
the little air flapper in the air sensor unit, the pump will come on.
When you let the flap close, the pump will turn off.  Now you can
pressurize the fuel loop and take a look about.

&gt; I own a '79 2.0 Fuel Injected Westy. Recently I had a sudden fuel leak out
&gt; on the road.  It was a lot of gas and only leaked when the engine was
&gt; running.  I got home before it started a fire but I am having trouble
&gt; figuring out where it was coming from. It seems to be coming from inside
&gt; the gas tank compartment, but after taking the panel off I can't tell what
&gt; might be the source.
&gt; 	Could it be coming from the sending unit somehow?
&gt; 	Is there anyway to fix without pulling the engine?
&gt; Thanks in advance.
