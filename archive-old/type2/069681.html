Subject: Looking to trade Distributor for Guage

Hi folks,

I have a stock distributor for a nonCalifornia 74-79 bus (Bosch # 0 231 168
005,VW # 021 905 205P)
that I'd like to trade for either a VDO cylinder head temp or oil temp gauge
(preferably with sender.  The distributor comes with a set of points (used I
think), a new condensor, no cap or rotor.  Vaccuum chamber sucks (I mean,
it's good!!!).  I also have a crankshaft endplay tool I could trade for
something.

According to my maintainence log I now have 64,000 miles on the bottom end
(a Mofoco rebuild, BTW purchased in '90-'91 for $259) of my 1600cc single
port engine and 50,000 miles on my rebuilt heads (local friend rebuilt).
Before I finish and install my very own first rebuild on my spare engine, a
1600 dual port, I'd like to get some temperature data on my aged engine so I
can develop my own theory of relativity.  Any lonely vdo gauges out there
looking for a home (I promise I won't subject them to use above 250 deg ;-) ).
