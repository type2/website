&gt;My fuel gauge seems to be miscalibrated. When my tank is full it

&gt;One of the POs has obviously replaced the sender in the tank.
&gt;Unfortunately, this was done the quick and dirty way by cutting
&gt;a hole above the fuel tank to gain access to the sender. Could
&gt;an incorrect sender cause this problem? (such as a 68-73).

Don't know if it's the same for 79 but on my 73 there is a little box
mounted behind the fuel gauge, and on the box there is a very small set
screw that will adjust the range of the needle.
