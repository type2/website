Subject: Re: [T2] 1971 bay vs 1969 bay

&gt; - disk brakes in the front
&gt; - vacuum assist on the front brakes
&gt; - a dual port engine (stock)
&gt; - doghouse-type fan shroud for oil cooler (more efficient cooling)
&gt;
&gt; The major difference with the '69 was that it came with a single-port
&gt; engine (although who knows what it has now) and drum brakes all around
&gt; (and no vacuum assist).
&gt;
&gt; I also can't remember, the '69 might not have reverse lights?

yes there are reverse lights in all the bays afaik.
