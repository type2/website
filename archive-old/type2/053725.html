Subject: wisconsin bus owners

Anybody who owns a bus in Wisconsin please reply!  

I had recently taken a '72 Westfalia  out of 12 years
of storage and returned it to running condition. 
While I believe it is mechanically sound and running
well, it would be nice to have a friendly VW owner
take a second look at it.  And it would be nice to
have another bus to compare it to.  It's just the
beginning on my long road to restoring it, but any
help would be greatly appriciated!

Thanks,

Andy Martin

'72 Westfalia
