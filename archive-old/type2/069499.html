No Halfords has not invaded the good old Us of A , or at least not
California.
we have horrible cheap Chinese toolkits for sale in our Flea markets (boot
sales).

Does anyone have a need for a good quality set of BSF or Whitworth
spanners/wrenches that I brought over here, I no longer have my '34 Austin 7.

Great pictures on the web page.
