Subject: Searching for the perfect transmission oil--GL-4 Hypoid of course.

Dr. Bob +ACY- list,

Just ordered a 16 gallon drum of GL-4 Hypoid 85/90wt. +ACo-Stalube+ACo- gear oil
+ACo-delivered+ACo- from NAPA. They have it by the qt., and gal. size as well. Found
another commercial supplier in South San Diego that had it for less +ACQAJA- but
only in the Castrol brand.  Kendall has apparently discontinued the GL-4
gear oil. al

You will need approx. 2 gal. for your 71 bus tranny. One for the first 300
to 500 mile break in, and the other for the first maintenance service.
