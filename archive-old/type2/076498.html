&gt;&gt;&gt;I did not leap in to volunteer the correct number (232,000). Not
&gt;totally honest, but made a big difference in the end. 
&gt;
&gt;p.s. Sorry if I offended any list members with my flexible scruples.&lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt;i am not personally offended. its your decision &amp; if you can live with it,
&gt;then do so.  however, my wallet is offended.  situations like this are just
&gt;one of the reasons that insurance rates are so high. &amp; i'm not saying that
&gt;just to flame someone, either. i've been through similar situations &amp; felt
&gt;that i had to add my .02 on this thread.


This fortunate misreading of the mileage in this case just saved 
everyone time, money and aggravation. The outcome was that the 
owner of this Bus got what he was entitled to: reimbursement of 
the damage sustained in an accident that is covered by an insurance 
company. 

I just moved to the US and picked my Bus up in Baltimore. It needed to 
be insured so we added it as a second vehicle to my girlfriends 
insurance, for now. I am very suprised to see that I'm only insured 
for 15K here and 15K there, it's like driving around with no insurance 
at all. The standard car insurance in Holland, or the countries around 
it, is something like, $2.500.000 maximum per case. 15K doesn't even 
cover a few weeks in hospital. The strangest thing is that this 15K 
liabillity insurance costs me twice as much as what I had in Holland, 
where my Bus was also covered 'all risks' to the estimated value of 
around 15K (at todays exchange rate). Insuring a 15K risk should not 
cost more than $30 a months or so. The insurance companies can collect 
a lot of premiums and hand out 15K here and there, great way to do 
business...

Needless to say, I'm worried about someone running into my Bus in 
some way. Isn't it so, that if it is values by an approved company, 
to a certain value, that the insurance has to treat it as if it 
was a 1999 car with a certain &quot;blue book&quot; value? I would greatly 
appreciate any info on how to insure a Bus in the US, in such a way 
I won't be paying someone's wheel chair the rest of my life (fingers 
crossed), or loose my investment in case some uninsured driver runs 
into it. 

All that said, there is no way an insurance company could -really- 
'undo' the damage to my Bus, it would just never be the same. 

Brian.
