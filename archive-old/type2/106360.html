Subject: mud flap mounting

I finally saw a set of factory mudflaps and I understand how they mount now.

There is an L-bracket  about 8 inches long and 1 inch long after the corner. The short end bolts into one of two holes in the engine carrier clips that hang down from the frame. The other piece in the hardware kit is a trapezoidal piece with a bend that connects to the bottom end of the rear wheel well by two bolts. The mudflap is sandwiched between these two pieces of hardware and held in place by two bolts.
