Jack,
Pretty sure &quot;Jbugs&quot; who is now owned by &quot;California Pacific&quot; carries dizzies. Funny thing - in the Jbugs catalog, a stock dizzy for a 75' 1800 was priced at something like $336.00!!! Might have been a typo...   You west coast-ers might know more about California Pacific...

&gt;For several years, I've been buying refurbished stock distributors from Jim

&gt;Does anyoine know if OVH is still in operation?
&gt;Is there another source for stock distributors?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
