&gt;If I had paid $250 I could have had a nice OEM muffler. But at the

&gt;the other major issues.

&gt;I really didn't expect much from a $99 muffler. I'm certainly not
&gt;going to bash Bus Depot for selling it. I knew going in it was junk.

Indeed, EMPI fills the big market for short term fixes. When you add up all 
the short term mentality, you end with the same cost to do it right the 
first time in addition to the compromise, get by for now, costs. Do piece 
it on down the road, but get real and realize that $5000 time/money added 
to a good chassis to begin with is about the lowest possible time/money for 
anything like safe and reliable to something like the original standards 
contemplated. So, put into place the plan to build it back to standard 
factory specs, German parts, quality assembly, with the factory procedures 
in hand and in control.
