Subject: RE: [T2] thermostat

Jeff,

We sell the complete reconditioned kit for $89.99 with a new thermostat. In
the olden days folks said the engine would run cooler with out the flaps in
there. This has since been corrected and the original intent is back in
action. i.e. get the engine up to proper running temperature as soon as
possible and keep it there.
