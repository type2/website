&gt; &gt; Do people actually know the origin of that bear?
&gt;
&gt; I *am* amazed!  The dancing bear was the logo that Mike Owsley put on the
&gt; acid tabs he distributed at early Dead shows.  (Don't ask how I know ;-*)
&gt;
Ok, here's the story;
 Stanley Owsley was the Dead's soundman. he was also one of the innovative
chemists of LSD. His nickname was Bear. Hence the album &quot;Bear's Choice&quot; is his
production baby from shows he ran sound for. The dancing bears are shown as an
illustration on that cover, and were also used as decorations on the infamous
blotter paper. Owsley floated around the Greenpeace booth at lotsa shows, and I
had the pleasure of talking with him at length last March.
 As for the VW content- he used to drive a Karmann Ghia. He had some
interesting views on busses and cars indeed...
