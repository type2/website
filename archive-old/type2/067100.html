&gt; Also in interesting news:  I think it a fair statement that the Corvair was
&gt; an attempt by GM to emulate the bug, right?  Anyway, they didn't stop at
&gt; the bug.  Did you know there is an air-cooled, small van/bus thing called a
&gt; Corvair something or other?  A very bizarre vehicle indeed.
&gt; 
&gt; Just meaningless chatter,

If you are referring to the Greenbriar line of Chevy vans, I would not
call them bizarre.  These were quite nice, and like the ford Econoline,
came in singlecab pickup versions, similar to the VW.

Except, unlike the VW versions, they had more horsepower than your average
riding mower.

Except, unlike the VW versions, the sides didn't fold down.

There are still a few of these floating about in my neck of the woods, owned
by some diehard Corvair fans.  I think that the worse a vehicle is mechanically,
the more dedicated the fanatics. (maybe excepting Chevy Vegas and Pacer owners)

If you want to start collecting another unique vehicle, I'm sure that there are
still some available out there...
