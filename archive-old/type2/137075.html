Subject: Re: [T2] Can't get engine out

Hi All,

Thanks for the pointers. I have *all* of the rear tin off (and the oil 
filler).

The real problem is that the engine wont disengage from the 
transmission. Can I pull side to side as I'm pulling back? Or do I risk 
scratching something important by creating friction?

thanks again,
Harry
