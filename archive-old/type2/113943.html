Okay, I can't let this one go.

You say you are mad when you see someone driving alone in a big V8 SUV?  Let me ask you this - do you ever drive alone in your bus?

The reason I ask is simple - Big V8 SUVs get about the same mileage as VW busses.  I should know, I own one of each.  One '73 VW bus, one '97 Ford Expedition.  They get about the same mileage (15 city, 20 highway).  And you know what?  The Expedition produces much less emissions than the VW.

That said, I still drive my bus because, as someone else mentioned, we have the freedom to drive what we want here in America (and Canada too).
