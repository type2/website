Subject: Re: [T2] Baywindow Popout Glass &amp; Fiamma Rack

&lt;&lt; (1) Back when I was still brain-storming my resto, I recall coming across

custom popout glass and frame for the rear hatch of a Baywindow.  Anyone

know the vendor or have a link?

 &gt;&gt;

Just for the empirical evidence, I used a plumber's smoke bomb wired
underneath the bus and had a buddy follow me as I drove...The smoke
came out from the bottom of the bus and went straight up the back
to the roof...Anybody with severe oil leaks will note the same effect...
The oil comes out  from under the back of the bus and is deposited
on the engine hatch and the rear hatch and window...Now, I can't say
for sure that a pop out hatch window will suck exhaust fumes back
into the bus, but I might bet a virtual buck that it does... ;-(
