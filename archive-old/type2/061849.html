&gt; I am thinking of replaceing the ice box in my 72 sporsmobile with a
refrigerator.I see they have norcold ref. in the J.C.whitney book but
they are not cheap!If anybody has done this can you tell me if it is
worth the swap or will I simply be throwing good money away.Maybe
someone can offer a better idea than norcold.

Advantages to refrigerators:
You can make a small amount of ice
More room for food (no blocks of ice)
No need to buy ice, so you can stay in the boonies longer
Definite cool factor  (pun intentional)

Disadvantages of refrigerators
Expensive!
Must be reasonably level to function (if you are comfortable in the
bus, it's level enough)
Needs 110v or propane to run for long periods.  Battery will not last
more than a few hours.  You have to remember to switch modes when
parking or risk dead batteries.
more parts to maintain/break.
Takes up space in bus, cannot be removed.
Has a hard time maintaining temperature in high ambient temperatures.

I've gone both ways at times and have reverted back to a good quality
Thermos ice chest.  I prefer this to both the refrigerator and to the
upright ice box for reasons of portability, economy, and simplicity.
