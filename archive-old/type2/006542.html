Because it's designed to have a &quot;tight&quot; spot in the straight-ahead position,
it is very important to get the steering gear accurately centered along with
the rest of the steering components.  Failure to do so can shorten the
service life of the steering gear considerably.  In fact, if the steering
gear is adjusted without first being properly centered it can bind or even
lock up.

Most repair manuals have a procedure for centering the steering gear in
their writeup about how to adjust it.

Proper alignment settings are very important, but that job isn't done until
the steering gear is correctly centered so it _stays_ centered as the bus is
driven in a straight line.  The position of the steering wheel spokes is NOT
an accurate indication of the correct centering of the steering gear.
