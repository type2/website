Subject: Alternator Light 77

Recently my Alternator light has started coming on
intermittenly at low speeds (&lt;25) along with the EGR
Light (EGR has been removed long ago...).  Also the
alternator and pully seems very very hot to the touch,
though I can't remember if this is unusual or not. 
The bus continues to start and run like a champ.

I was happenning all the time and I cleaned the
positive connection on the battery terminal and that
helped some, as it was on all the time, I'll try
cleaning the post and replacing the terminal on the
end of the wire tonight as well.  The wiring coming
out of the Alternator still feels supple and not
melted, cracked or burned...

Anything else to check ?

Also this is a new alternator about 2 months old, I
recently replaced my old alternator and battery
together as my battery boiled over ...trust me hearing
a loud boom from the back of the bus pooling over and
seeing the tops of the battery off with large amounts
of vapor escaping is a seriously scary thing to see ! 


Once the new alternator was installed everything
worked great and no lights on the dash, until now 

I'm hoping I don't have to pull the alternator again
as that was one difficult task compared to alternators
I've replaced on other vehicles.
