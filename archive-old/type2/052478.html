Subject: [T2] Brake Seized Up

Last week I drove my bus a good distance in the pouring rain.  It was about
a 3 hour drive.  When I got to my destination I set my emergency brake and
left the bus for the weekend.  When I got back two days later, I started up
the bus and attempted to drive away... but my right rear wheel was locked up
so I could not move.

I suspected that my emergency brake has somehow rusted to the drum and was
causing this, so I got out my trusty hammer (yes.. the same hammer that
helps me in hot start situations) and gave my wheel a few good whacks.  The
wheel was now free and I was able to drive away.

My question is.. is this a normal occurrence in wet weather? Or do I have a
big problem to worry about?  I had the brakes done about 4000 miles ago.. so
I would assume they are in good shape.

Thanks again for any ideas..
