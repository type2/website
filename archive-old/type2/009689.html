I have a possible oil pressure problem that has been puzzling me.  I have a 
2.0L FI stock engine in a '79 bus.  Ever since the rebuild, my oil pressure 
gauge will drop to zero at the first stop sign (or light :) on a cold 
engine.  I give it a little gas and it usually returns to around 40psi and 
stays there until the oil is warm.  I did not replace the oil pump (it had 
very little wear).  I recently tried polishing the oil pressure relief 
plunger and replacing the spring and washer--no change.  Switching from 
10w30 to 20w50 seemed to help a little.  Any ideas?  Is the oil pump shot?  
How serious is this?

Thanks!
matt
