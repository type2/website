&gt; &gt; After you make sure that you got the right cable, be sure to order another

&gt; Good advice. The cable that came with my Bus had 3 washers on the end
&gt; because of stretch (I assumed).  I bought a new one and it had the exact
&gt; same problem - too long. So I still have 3 washers at the end of my cable.
&gt; Don't recall its length I assumed If I ordered  a cable for a 1978 Bus it
&gt; would fit (RMMW). Does anyone know what length cable I should have for a1978
&gt; Bus?

Washers are used to get the correct &quot;bow&quot; in the flexible bowden tube at
the end of the clutch cable tube.  The washers might be correct.

Now, if they are on the inner cable itself, they are not right!
