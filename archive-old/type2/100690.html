Subject: Intake manifold gaskets.

Original Question:
I decided to replace the intake manifold gaskets on my 82 2.0L Vanagon this weekend....Any suggestions on the best way to loosen up the manifolds and replace the gaskets while the engine is still in the van?

&gt;Not too hard, just remove the AFM unit, disconnect the fuel ring
&gt;(at the cold start injector), disconnect the injectors from the &gt;runners (be sure to protect the tips - wrap em in a baggie), then &gt;remove the nuts holding the runners to the heads.  Pull the runners &gt;out to the sides, you may have to wiggle them a bit.

Mike:

If he's just doing the runner to plenum gaskets, can't he just loosen the bolts on the runners with the injectors/electricals attached to get the room he needs? He didn't say he was gonna do the gaskets at the block.

Later,

Billy
