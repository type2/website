Subject: clean out crank case without opening it?

I pulled the breather-box-cap off my case, and
I see oil that has dried up (cooked?) and turned
to grease inside my case.  I hope this is only
above oil level, and not throughout the entire
case...

Are there any oil additives that will clean this
stuff out?  I'm thinking about moving the engine
out to the parts cleaner, and run paint thinner
through it for a few days.

The engine is out, so I might as well change
the oil again.  Any suggestions for solvents
to run through my case?

Jen
