&gt; Greetings volks
&gt; Having recently acquired a 69 westy I went to check the archives to decode
&gt; the M-codes. Discovered 67 and earlier no prob, 70 and later no prob. Did
&gt; 68 and 69 not exist? : ) Would appreciate if one of you folks could decode the
&gt; following;
&gt; 19  8
&gt; 181  191  500  517
&gt; 21  426  097  119  121
&gt; 2310  523324  9005635
&gt; would really like to know date of manufacture and where delivered
&gt; tia

&gt; 70 westy
&gt; 69 westy?

Hi there,

It has been a long time since I last posted anything about option codes
(also known as 'M-codes'). Yes, it is right there is nothing to find on
the web about the plates from the '68 and '69 busses. I am still
planning on putting some info on my page about it, but I don't have the
time lately. 

The Early Baywindow plates are basically the same as the late splitty
plates. But there is a little difference. The baywindows have some
engine info on them. Let's decode this plate.

  19 8
  181 191 500 517
  21 426 097 119 121
  2310 523324 9005635

19 8 = the date, same as on Splitties: 18th of August. Your van has been
built in the first half of model year 1969 (judging from the VIN it was
number 5635) so the exact  production date is 19th of August 1969.

Option codes (also known as 'M-codes'):
181 = Strange code. The VW micro fiche says it means &quot;Chrome instead
      of painted parts&quot;, but it also states that this code is used
      since 1974. So perhaps it means something else on older busses.
191 = &quot;With outer and center underfloor plates&quot;, These are plates
      fixed under your car to make it more solid and to protect the
      bottom.
500 = Full width metal partition between cabin and cargo/passenger
      compartment
517 = Campmobile
426 = Specifications for the USA? Not sure. Perhaps it means 'speedo in
miles', sealed 
      beam headlamps', side marker reflectors' and such.
097 = Car radio, model &quot;Emden&quot;
119 = Eberspaecher gasoline heater
121 = Fresh air fan in cabin (nice option code!)

Then there is some info about the engine:
21  = the 2 stands for: Option code 157 - &quot;Exhaust control system'
      the 1 stands for: 4 speed manual transmission

Model info:
2310 = the 2 stands for: Type 2
       the 3 stands for: Kombi (van with windows)
       the 1 stands for: LHD, sliding door right
       the 0 stands for: - nothing in this case -

Color info:
523324 = the 5233 stands for :a certain color, which one I don't
                              know. If someone does know, mail me!
                              (molenari_at_dds.nl)
         the 24 stands for: a certain color of the seats and door
                            panels, again I don't know which one

          *) These colors are probably all standard VW colors, but for
          some reason they used a different code on Westfalias

9005635  This is the VIN. The '9' stands for model year 1969. The
'005635'
         tells you it is the 5635th bus produced in that model year.
         *) the complete VIN is formed by adding the type number:
         - 239 005 635 -

So there is no indication of where this bus was exported to. It could be
possible that in the first months of 1969 they didn't put this on the
plate. For what reason, I don't know. It's strange, because splitties
did have an export code and so do the later busses.
The other possibility is that it was delivered inside Germany, which
seems strange as well because it has an exhaust control system.

Something about the date. Near VIN 9150000 they changed the system of
displaying the production date:
Before it was DAY &amp; MONTH:      18 3 - 18th of March
Later it changed to WEEK &amp; DAY: 43 4 - Week 43, Thursday



I hope I provided you with some interesting information, even though it
isn't technical.
