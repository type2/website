Subject: fs: Airconditioner from a  77 westy

Hey... this is a bit late, but maybe i'll catch someone... I've got an 
underdash style airconditioner from my 77 westy.  It wasn't working when 
i removed it, and i'm sure it needs a lot of work... I'd like to get rid 
of it, so it'll be pretty cheap.  It can't be shipped, but i can bring 
it to the  June Jitterbug tomorrow in Niagara Falls, Canada, at 
fireman's park.  Email me at tgtsfkncld_at_att_dot_net for more info.... Also, 
my cell number is 716-930-2064.  If you can't get ahold of me, try to 
find me at the show... My van won't be in it, but it's the rustiest one 
in the parking lot, schoolbus yellow westy with a sign in the back that 
says &quot;HEY MAN&quot;.  

thanks...
