Subject: Seized engine or not?

I am wondering if the 69 Bus I bought has a seized engine or not.

The details are as follows:

- 1600 with solex carburetor, engine installed in 1994
- last time it run was 3 years ago
- the rear wheels do not turn, front wheels rotate great and the drums seem to
be in much better shape than the rear ones
- gear shift seems to be in neutral
- clutch pedal is very difficult to move, I would say jammed. The clutch lever
on the tranny seems to move a little bit.
- I can not turn the pulley by hand

Some of the things I am going to try in the next couple of days are:
- check tranny fluid
- put some oil in the cylinders
- spray all clutch linkages with oil
- try to take the rear wheels off, I will have to find a 46 mm socket and
breaker bar.

Any other things I can try?

Cheers,

Hans Brouwer
