Fuel Injection-It's nothing to be afraid of!  I bought my old '76 Westy 
mainly because the FI had been removed and it had a single Weber carb. After 
reading so many horror stories about FI, I wanted no part of it. Well, the 
Weber presented it's own nightmares, which I never fully sorted out. My '77 
has the FI, and for the past two weeks I've been tearing everything apart, 
replacing fuel lines, injector seals, cleaning electrical connections, 
replacing the manifold boots, and it now runs very nicely. Thanks in large 
part to Sean Bartnik's FI info, and Bentley's, I now believe I understand the 
function of each part, and how the system works. It's no longer some dark 
mysterious force. The '77 barely ran when I bought it, and replacing all the 
vacuum lines/seals/etc. has made a very big difference. Some of you may 
remember a while back I had dropped my spark plug socket under the tin by #1 
cylinder, had a hell of a time getting it out. One tool I bought after that 
was a flexible neck light with a magnetic pick up on the end. I don't know 
how I made it so long without this thing-it's great for looking into the dark 
recesses of the T-4 engine. It was only $7.00, money well spent. I finally 
got tags for the Westy this week, finally gonna get to drive it this weekend. 
 The axle beam replacement is done, and while I can't say it was fun, this 
too was a valuable learning experience, and again, thanks to listmembers who 
posted details of the job. I've delved further into this vehicle than any 
I've ever owned before, but I now feel more comfortable with it. BTW, the 
fuel lines were close to disaster, I know it's said  a lot here, but if you 
haven't looked at yours in a while, do it now! Can't wait for Everybus 2001!
