Subject: RE: [T2] Sliding door question/lighting question
Content-Disposition: inline

 The sliding door on the '73 is loose on the bottom, when you slide it open. Is there something missing/unhooked?

Also the dash light for the speedometer is out. Who would sell the bulb for it?? Could there be something else wrong with the light??
