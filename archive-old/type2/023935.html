Subject: Timing notch on '73 1700
Message-ID: &lt;6b45c524.249ff9d0_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Volks... My primary bus is a '71 Kombi/Camper with a 1600DP engine, with 
corresponding notches on the pulley wheel for timing.  Having recently gotten 
a '73 Sunroof with a CB engine (dual carb-1700?), that is to be used by my 
son for his second year of college, I was attempting to tune it up, prior to 
syncing the carbs.  I went to find the timing notch on the pulley wheel and 
had no luck.... no tiny notch, no paint spot, nothing...I carefully cleaned 
the wheel, used my fingernail to feel for any kind of notch on the front of 
the wheel (FIF) ...zip.... I can find approximate TDC by lining up the rotor 
with the notch on the dizzy, and feeling the slack in the pully wheel...there 
is a scratch on the rear of the pully wheel (FIF) that I am wistfully 
thinking lines up with the 10 degree mark on the timing scale....but that 
seems reaching for straws.

Additional info... the PO said that when he purchased the bus from the PPO, 
that he was told this is a rebuilt engine, with odometer reset to zero... if 
so, have about 7200 miles since a rebuild...

would a rebuild include installation of a pulley that has no markings?  If 
so, how do I mark TDC on the pully wheel?  (figure I could find TDC by seeing 
where the #1 piston stops moving up by putting something in the spark plug 
hole).  With the fan arrangement that is on a 1700,  I find it difficult to 
see the case half lines.  am I going to have to pull the heads and watch #1 
piston, and make a precise guess at where the mark should be?

Anyone ever had this problem?  Usually I can find the answers in the 
archives, Bentley or Muir, but this one has me stumped... Thanks for any info
