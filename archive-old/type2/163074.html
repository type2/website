Friday post (u outta be warned)

These are called &quot;sucres&quot; (sugars, because of their apperance) in
french. Very popular by the shade tree mechanics over there. My dad
taught me everything about them. The Home Deported ones are quite
oversized

&gt; Is it something like that ???

Discount tire of america fixed the nail puncture in my Signet SV tire
for free. I did not even buy the tire there! wow.

I have just over 1000 miles on the rebuilt rebuilt type1, time to
flush the best Rite-Aid oil. Oil light does not come on at idle
anymore after I cleaned up both oil pressure valves.
