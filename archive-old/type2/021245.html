Missy:
I'd second that idea: Taking  donations by Paypal is a good idea!
My attention span gets interrupted after I leave the computer! with Paypal I DO
IT NOW!

&gt; someone might want to check on this, but...paypal has a referral bonus to
&gt; the person that referred and a sign-up bonus for the new person.  the
&gt; listmaster could set up an account and everyone (that was new to paypal)
&gt; can use the listmaster as the referral, therefore giving $5 to the
&gt; listmaster.  then the new member can give the $5 bonus they received to the
&gt; list.  The end result....each new member ends up donating $10 of paypal's
&gt; money to our cause.
&gt;
&gt; anyway, i love this list.  tell me when and where, i'll donate.
