Subject: loose antenna

As long as I've got my head under the dash tinkering w/ my windshield washers,
I might as well take care of another problem nearby. My antenna is sort of
loose. Having never seen one not in place, I have no idea how it hooks on, can
someone clue me in. How big of a pain is it gonna be to tighten it up?? Is
this a sign that I'm gonna have to take my little Weinerschnitzel Hotdog man
off the top of my antenna??(GASP)
