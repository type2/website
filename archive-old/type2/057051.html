&gt; 
&gt; Please Help!
&gt; 
&gt; I have a '79 type 2 with a rusted out passenger side heater exchanger or
&gt; &quot;heater box.&quot;  I have been trying to find a replacement for about two
&gt; weeks now and have had no luck.  Where can I find such a part and how
&gt; much can I expect to pay for it.  The one I found they want almost three
&gt; hundred dollars for... I can not afford that.  In the mean time the
&gt; local officers of the law are frowning on my noise levels.  Help.

I have an '81 pass. side heat exchanger.  I would be able to help Jared if
it fits into a '79.  
Does anyone know if an '81 will fit into a '79?  I don't think it will,
but I'm not certain.
