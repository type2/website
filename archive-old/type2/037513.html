Subject: Re: Starting a bus without a ley

I had the key snap off in the ignition while on vacation on a holiday
weekend at night on a lonely country road. This is how I got it started. 

I crawled under the bus and cut 5ft of ignition wire (my ignition key was
useless so what the hell) I attached one end to the hot side of the battery
and the other end to the hot side of the coil(thats the side furtherest
away from the center of the engine or the side that is NOT connected to the
points/condenser/dist....got it?) Then I used a scewdriver to jump the
starter or you can just bump start it in gear. I drove that baby from
Monterey to Los Angeles just like that.

&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;Hold the flames because I AM NOT TRYING TO STEAL A BUS:)
&gt;
&gt;There is a 1969 bus for sale at a very low price in my area( clear title).
&gt;Beacuse of major problem with our family car I might be cheaper to by this
&gt;bus then get the volvo fixed.
&gt;
&gt;The bus ran ok when last parked  over a year ago but the key has been lost.
&gt;I want to go look  over the bus and see about buying it but I really want to
&gt;get it started while I am there.
&gt;
&gt;Can a bus be started and driven with the key in the off position. The owner
&gt;reports that if there is a steering wheel lock is does not work so that is
&gt;not an issue. Any adivce in the matter would be greatly appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;Please respond privately.
