&gt;Just put a 1.8L with two carbs from another engine into  my 72 Westy. I
&gt;have adjusted the carbs as on page 57 of Haynes. It starts right up and
&gt;runs fine, but after it warms up and is turned off for a few minutes it
&gt;turns over but won't start again until it cools off. I don't think it is
&gt;overheating. I suspect the  &quot;mixture control screws&quot; (one on each carb) may
&gt;be off since the chokes seem to be operating fine and everything else
&gt;checks out. The screws are set at 2 1/2 turns out. If I want it richer do I
&gt;turn them out more? 

Yes, but 2-1/2 turns should be more than enough.  Did you also set the
small idle mixture screw on top of the left carb?

&gt;Do the screws control air or fuel?  

Fuel for idle.

&gt;I also don't have a
&gt;CO Analyser Meter and this thing is supposed to pass inspection tomorrow.
&gt;Any ideas? 

Put the idle screws in until the rpms drop, then back out 3/4 turn, and
don't shut it off.  :-)
