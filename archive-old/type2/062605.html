Subject: Gas cap

I lost my cap to my '69.  Apparantly '69 is an odd year for gas caps.
Catalogues list through 68, skip '69 and pick up again in '70.  I tried various
home made gas caps including coke cans, corks and pieces of wood.  Eventually I
found a junker '69 and asked the owner for the gas cap..He said I could have it
but only if I took the rest of the bus with it.  Towed it thirty miles to home,
parted it out and cut up the body with a sawzall.  City came and took it away.
All I really wanted was the gas cap, but I did use some other stuff.. front sway
bar, brake drums (better specs than mine)...John Jensen in Annapolis
