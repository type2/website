&gt; The sump plate senders are OEM Porsche parts and give useful

I'm not going to get into a p***ing match with you about oil temp senders.  I 
stand by my original statement.  OEM Porsche sump plate senders are not even 
close to what's commonly used.
Obviously the original poster isn't very knowledgeable about the nuances of 
air cooled VW's.
A better way to say the same thing might be something like:
There are some oil temp senders that work the way they should and I believe 
one is the OEM Porsche sump plate senders.  They work better because blaa 
blaa blaa.  They can be purchased at blaa blaa blaa.
Isn't the purpose of this list to pass on our hard won knowledge to help our 
brother/sister bus owners?

&gt; An expensive bit of insurance, that.
  
Not at all when you consider the cost and inconvenience of having to replace 
an engine in an emergency situation

&gt; I run 87 (or lower if I'm in higher 
&gt; elevation) and prevent pinging by keeping tabs on the timing, compression, 
&gt; and engine temperature.  To each their own I guess.

You obviously know what your doing.  You must be very intelligent and well 
read on the subject.  By the way where do you get fuel that is lower than 87?
