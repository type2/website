I guess I had forgotten the reasons I used to stick with straight 40 back
when I initially made my decision to do same.

As is the usual, once you have done your research and come to a decision,
you are generally better off to stick with what you came up with, even
after you have long forgotten all of the facts that got you there.

I'm gonna go back to doing some reading on the subject, and I bet I come
up with what I decided upon way back when......... For Houston, Texas -
Straight 40 weight oil is probably one's best bet, with maybe a just a
slight change when in the coldest throws of what we call our Winter down
here.

Thanks Karl, for getting me back on the right track as to oil weight.
