Subject: bad buyer

So, I had a woman look at my 1977 Westy yesterday, she
had to be in her late 50's and could hardly walk. I'm
asking $2,900 for my Bus, so, I'm not asking a hell of
alot. She said for the price she thought she would get
something in better shape, in my mind look at
thesamba_dot_com and in NYC someone is also selling a 1977
westy, rusty, back bumper about to fall off, and
graffiti all over it. She asked how many owners my Bus
had, I said I don't know, it just got here from Cali
last year, she said I should know that. Do all of you
know how many owners your Bus had? She said that the
air-cooled engines dont last that long. She asked how
many engines my Bus has had? I said I don't know, it
could be the original one. She said again, I should
know these things, I lost it at that point and told
her nobody would know these things unless you owned it
from day one. Am I nuts?
