Subject: Re: Bus tires

Having worked in the auto industry, and searched for good tires for my
Kombi, I came across literature for the Michelin MX.  The MX was listed in
the literature as being specifically for the Vanagon, but because it is not
a commonly stocked tire, you really have to know what you're asking for
or you may end up with MX4 passenger tires...

I understand and can relate to the general distrust of tire dealers, and am
skeptical when I take my old VW's to anyone for service I'm not able to do
for the car myself.  I've even been told by the local VW dealer they won't
do
a state inspection (which on my car is essentially a horn and light check)
because they don't have anyone to work on aircooled VW's...(I guess the
newer cars must have watercooled electrical systems or something)

I have 2 more MX's on order for the Kombi and will have them put on
while the Kombi gets its body worked over, and look forward to the
improvement they will have on the handling.

&gt;Hi,
&gt; Mike writes:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Geez, I just purchased a new set of tires for my '79 Westy.  I thought I
&gt;&gt; did my homework and eventually decided on a full set of 185R14 Michelin
MX
&gt;&gt; 6ply reinforced tires with a load/speed rating of 94R (1540lbs.)
&gt;
&gt; These sound OK to me, but the &quot;94R&quot; rating doesn't tie up with your
&gt;stated weight rating: a 94R tyre is rated to a maximum of 1477lbs at
&gt;a maximum speed of 106mph. Do they have the &quot;C&quot; suffix?
&gt;
&gt;&gt; But now am I to assume that these are not up to spec?
&gt;
&gt; IMHO they are (just) within spec.
&gt;
&gt; I wrote that 95 was a minimum and 97 offered better handling. I also
&gt;suggested that &quot;most listees&quot; thought that this was the case, which,
&gt;on reflection, was probably an overstatement if not an outright lie...
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Where did you get these figures?  I searched through the archives for
tire
&gt;&gt; info and didn't find any specs this demanding.  Most tire dealers I spoke
&gt;&gt; with said the reinforced MX was made specially for Vanagons; most also
&gt;&gt; did not stock these tires and had to place a special order.
&gt;
&gt; I got those figures from my interpretation of the postings to the
&gt;list on the improvements in handling that listees have experienced
&gt;with &quot;Load range D&quot; and similar tyres, from my own research (reading
&gt;and driving experience) on the subject over a period of several years
&gt;and from reading owners and workshop manuals.
&gt; I should have said something like &quot;some listees report...&quot; or &quot;It has
&gt;been suggested...&quot; but hey: this is the net!
&gt; I am extremely skeptical about claims that the MX was specially made
&gt;for Vanagons. There are any number of vans in Europe that use a 185R14C
&gt;tyre. I should say that my impression of US tyre dealers generally
&gt;is pretty poor, largely as a result of the reports that I've read on
&gt;this list, so I wouldn't believe anything I was told by one...
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Since we're on the subject... what exactly does it mean to have a load
&gt;&gt; rating of say, 1540lbs?  Does that mean 4 tires with that load rating can
&gt;&gt; support 4 x 1540lbs?  Or is this per axle?
&gt;
&gt; It's per tyre: total load shouldn't exceed 6160lbs in your example,
&gt;but you need to take into account that the rear axle carries more
&gt;weight than the front, so if you have a 60/40 distribution you should
&gt;look at the minimum specs for the higher loaded axle.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I don't have the owner's manual for the Westy... anyone know the weight
of
&gt;&gt; one of these?
&gt;
&gt; For a '78 Westy (&quot;Campmobile&quot;) the GVW is listed at 4961 lbs. Gross rear
&gt;axle weight 2800 lbs. That suggests a minimum of 1400lbs.
&gt; The Kombi and delivery van go up to 2866 lbs.
&gt; A load index of &quot;93&quot; would be 1433 lbs so you could argue that this
&gt;is all you need. You won't convince me, though :-).
&gt;
&gt; The Vanagon requires a &quot;97R&quot; load rating. You can get away with a bit
&gt;less on a type2. IMHO that &quot;bit less&quot; gets you to a minimum 95.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Anyway, I've had these Michelins for a week and have been very happy.
Oh,
&gt;&gt; she handles like a dream!  Can't wait to see how gas milage improves.
&gt;&gt; Although... anything would have been an improvement over the
&gt;&gt; cracked and balding old Yokohamas I used to have!
&gt;
&gt; Don't worry, be happy! I'm sure these will be fine. You might like to
&gt;try and get an opportunity to drive a bus with higher rated tyres in a
&gt;crosswind, though, you may be surprised at the difference.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;   W.
