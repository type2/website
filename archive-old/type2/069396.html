Subject: The Beam, Part 5: The finalie, and th etune up..

Alright..i guess it took longer to get around to this than i thought..:) 
&lt;i left my notebook in the bus, and didnt feel like going out to get it, 
you know?&gt;

So, Tuesday...
Went to get the shocks from Goodmans, and after waiting around for a 
while, we found out that dads credit card wasnt working anymore, and we 
of course, didnt have the cash to pay it off..so, he held then for us, 
and we were to get them the next day..Before we ent to get them, we were 
driving all around town looking for upper shock mount bolts! the head 
twisted off the pass. side one wene we tried to remove it...have you ever 
tired to find 12mm grade 8 bolts, at least 100mm long, but not to much 
longer????? even the big ol' KC Nut and bolt Supply didnt have 'em..and they
also had a min. purchase of 50$'s..:(...tried V-Village. &lt;had previously 
called 'em about a beam, but they had said &quot;A what? i dunno what that 
is.&quot;...&gt; and angain got the impression of idiots..&lt;if i offend anyone, 
good..&gt; they were like, man..i dont know, why dont ya jus drill it out 
bigger? i left then..wheni walked in, one of their service techs was 
sorta laying on the counter, and this other guy was saying &quot;Whats 
amatter? They take away your vido games back there again? and the tech 
siad &quot;yeah..they wanted us to work&quot;....whadeva.... tried a 
bmw/mercades/porche parts place...they didnt have anything either.
Finialy found 'em at a Carquest... 
So anyway, we went home without the shocks, and proceeded to weld some 
flat steel straping up agains tthe frame to help reinforce it where it is 
cracked or rusted through.  Then sprayed undercoating on it, and went to 
bed..

Wendsday:
After picking up the shocks and damper, we proceeded to put the beam 
in...left the shocks off till we got it in, for mor eoom to work. Went in 
real smooth. It was hard to get out, because the passs. side shock mount 
bolt had cought on the brake line and hung on that. Of course, it cracked 
it, so we had to replace that..got one piece, and it was just 2 inces to 
short!! so we went back, and got another...fit in great..just a little 
long, but better than to short..
Found out the drag link ends are bad..lots of play....so, guesss we'l 
have to replace that..Bleed the front, since we couldnt get to the rear 
yet..real mushy...but, drove it anyway..had to get it out of the garage 
and all...cranked it up, and it was running like shit..real bad..but it 
drove..and handled wow!!
parked it, and went to bed..

Thruday:

Turkey! Brisquet!&lt;or how ever you speel it!:)&gt;  While we were working on 
the bus wendsday, dad had been smoking the meat..mmm! GOOD!:)
dads girlfriends family all came over &lt;why not, we ARE at her house..:)&gt;
after, me and dad pulled the tires off, and rotoated those..&lt;did the 
front while the beam was being done...&gt; cnat do the crossrotate, cause of 
the different tires types on the frnt and rear..oh well..
while they were off, we adjusted and bleed the rear brakes, still no 
pedal. bleed and bleed and bleed. front rear, around around 
around...tried it Muir way from farthest to closest, VW's way of front 
right, front left, rear right, rear left..still nothing. Gave up..

Friday:
Went out to get a cap and rotor for the dizzy, since when i set the 
timing thruday night &lt;got bored and was a bit pissed..:)&gt;it was not to 
smooth..and the cap had burn spots on the contacts..got over 
charged..would have been cheaper to just go into town to get 'em! 15.93 
for a cheap name cap an rotor! hell..in augusta, i could get bosch for 
12!and cheap &lt;Wells, from Autozone,&gt; for less than 8! instead, i had 
&quot;Standard&quot; from O'Rielly's.._dot_cant wait till the autozone opens.
Anyhow, put the bus back in the garage. Bleed 'em aagian. Nothing!!!!
i decided i'd find a volunteer from the list to help &lt;RIGHT!! stil 
waiting..:), and theni chagned the oil, couldnt replace the strainer like 
i need to because either NAPA or ORieelys carries it. had the Felpro 
gasket set though..nice set..anyhow...couldnt adjust the valves, cause 
i'd had to drive it..i'm not to worried about 'em, cause they havent 
mooved in the past more than say... .001, and that would only be maybe 
#3..at scheduled adjustments that is..:)i WILL get 'em adjusted 
though...dont worry...
poppee the cap  and otor on, and cranked her up...Vroom! smooooth...just 
like she should run..:) i do need to recheck the timing though..adjusted 
the carb a bit..still want to try a tick dizzy for it though..i hate 
009's...anyone want to look up what is stock for a 69 bus? &lt;you bentley 
owners out there&gt;, then anyone want to pass one on for free, or cheap?:)

So, drove it back to the city after that..well, cleaned her out real 
well..wow! she lookes amazing inside once cleaned up...its been so long 
since i saw it..you should have seen dads eyes! he'd never seen her 
cleaned out!! he almost approved!!;')

anyway, other than the extraextra play in the wheel, and the tendancy to 
wander, and the still needed alignment, &lt;but not to much, it seems&gt; she 
drove great out here...in the rain too..:)

now to order that rubber tape to rebuild the balljoint and tirrod end 
boots...


Saturday:
Nothing. Aint done nothing to her! fir the first time in a while! Its 
over for now...well, almost...gotta get the drag link, and a volunteer to 
bleed the brakes........thanks all!!!
