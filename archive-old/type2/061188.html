Subject: Re: Oil filer neck

&gt;The oil filler neck in my 71, type one
&gt;has a small chrome neck on it about 3- 4 inches long.  Apparantly for looks
&gt;only. Trying to add oil is next to impossible

I keep one of these in each bus wrapped in paper towels: go up to the
Wal-Mart and look in the automotive department for a red plastic spout
gizmo that screws onto the quart bottle of oil. You attach the gizmo the
the oil bottle, then rotate to turn it on/off. The oil doesn't come out
until everything is situated the way you want it. No muss no fuss. Runs
around 98 cents. Best thing since canned beer.
