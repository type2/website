&gt;I am tinkering, and the oil is WAY over capacity.  It seems like it may
&gt;smell of gas, but maybe I am paranoid.
&gt;I have drained the oil, and it seems to be extremely thin.  It is 30wt
&gt;Castrol.
&gt;If there is something in the oil, making it thin and over capacity, what do
&gt;you think it may be?

Sounds like gas from over-rich running. Leaking injector/s, bad oxy telling 
ECU it's lean lean lean so the computer puts out rich rich rich. Bad temp 
sensor can cause similar symptom. Pull plugs. Lots of carbon??? Confirm 
over rich. Change and monitor your oil daily and get it fixed pronto. If 
you see oil level increase by more than half a quart, change it again, till 
you find the cause and fix it.

Do a compression test. Weak cylinders= poor combustion= raw fuel in the 
crankcase.
Verify spark intensity. Weak spark   = poor combustion= raw fuel in the 
crankcase.

But do verify leak down of fuel pressure, and it that's it, find the 
leaking injector. It will be found serving the cylinder that has poor 
compression from gas diluted lubrication and scored walls and rings. 
Monitor the oil constantly. Daily is best, but at least every time you fill 
the tank. One day it will save your motor.
