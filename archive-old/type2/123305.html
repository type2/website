Greg,

Ummmmm...some &quot;no's&quot; in here...I'm gonna cut all the parts out except
what I consider the inaccuracies....see resposnes below.

Been reading the megasquirt list for about 2 years or so now...some of
those people are *far* beyond what I understand...and must be automotive 
engineers...and *good* ones!

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi Richard,
&gt; 
&gt; Well said. I'm not sure you're right though. I've done a lot of 
&gt; homework on VW Fi this winter researching a possible L-Jet or 
&gt; megasquirt install, and I'm prepared to back my claims.
&gt; 
&gt; En Garde!!

&gt; Have a look at this file:
&gt; www.texas912_dot_org/912E%20Tech%20Data/912E%20FI%20Technical%20Manual.pdf
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; So my reasearch tells us that the fuel pressure is constant... it's the 
&gt; *duration* of the injection pulse that sets the fuel volume. The pulse 
&gt; duration is generated by the ECU, which reacts to the AFM. Vacuum is 
&gt; not mentioned as having an affect on pulse duration or fuel pressure.
&gt; 
No, Bentley green book, page 11 in the FI section on testing the fuel 
pressure regulator.  Bentley &quot;says&quot; that fuel pressure is most important 
at idle because of the exhaust emissions.  It also says that when you test
the regulator you get:

vacuum hose off = ~35psi  (33-37 considered of by experienced mechanics)
vacum hose on   = ~28psi  (26-30 &quot;                                    &quot;)

So fuel pressure is *not* constant.  So, with hi vacuum(not much 
throttle), they want 28 psi...at hi throttle(low vacuum) they want
35psi.

Connector to the coil from ecu tells *when* to inject.
AFM tells *duration* of injector opening(or how much fuel).

The AFM line above is why a lot of us want to go to megasquirt...
#1, it is &quot;supposed&quot; to be a restriction in the air intake and #2,
I've &quot;heard&quot; that at about 4,000 rpm, the vane is on the max limit....so
you really don't get a longer duration of squirt, but you do get more of
them because the ecu is also watching the rpm's as well.


So, the below line is also not correct.  Otherwise, we would not have a
vacuum operated fuel pressure regulator.  

&gt; Vacuum is not directly related to fuel pressure except on trailing 
&gt; throttle. Perhaps you are confusing the L-jet system on FI buses with 
&gt; the D-Jet used on earlier VW's and Porsches.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; DISCLAIMER 2:
&gt; I don't claim to know everything. That's my teenage son's job.:^) If 
&gt; someone can disprove or dispel my arguments I'd be happy to listen. I 
&gt; like to learn something new every day, and most days I still do.

&gt; Happy trails,
