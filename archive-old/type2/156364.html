&gt; Thanks for the photo hosting tip. Here is a link to the photo:

&gt; looks pretty much like a hack job with lots of air gaps all around. I
&gt; suppose I need the conversion tins I posted about earlier. Anybody know of a
&gt; good cheap set?

While you're fiddling with the engine, you might move the vacuum advance
hose to the correct port on the carburator, the one that comes out the
left side.

Also, while you're fiddling with the tin, get rid of that fan shroud and
get the proper one for the engine.  The aftermarket &quot;36HP&quot; round top
shrouds lack the proper air vanes and can make the engine run hot.

If it were mine, I'd make the collection of a set of proper tin my first
priority.  It will take some effort, but it pays off in a reliable bus.
