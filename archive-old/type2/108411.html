&gt; 1962 VW Coca-Cola Bus from Hong Kong.

I have the same bus, sans the Coca Cola logo.  Not sure what they're selling
for, though:

Subject: [T2] Mini splittie &amp; picture of Giacomo

&gt; Had a nice surprise at church tonight.  A family came back form a short
vacation to Myrtle Beach, SC and while there they found an interesting
souvenir at the Gay Dolphin Gift Cove (Ocean blvd. &amp; Boardwalk at 10th; 916
North Ocean Boulevard, Myrtle Beach, SC 29577; 843-448-6550.)  (Our friends
have a champagne bay.)
&gt;
&gt; They picked up a couple of Die-cast splitties made by Welly.  They're
approximately 1:48 scale, with operating double side doors (don't remember
what they're called, the ones that replace the sliding door).  The text on
the underside labels them as a 1962 Microbus (Welly Product #9764).
&gt;
&gt; They got one to match their own bus, and picked up a white on red one for
us.  Really nice of them to think of us like that.
&gt;
&gt; There are full width bench seats, front, middle and rear; with a suitcase
between the middle and rear seat and a briefcase centered on the rear seat
(all molded in, except the middle seat which seems to be glued to a slightly
raised platform the same size as the seat bottom.  A splittie owner would
have to look at the dash to see how authentic it is...
