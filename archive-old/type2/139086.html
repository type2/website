&gt; I've found that Cofap, Mahle and OEM VW pistons are most always within 1
&gt; gram.

This is very true for pistons. Rods always need material removed and the
worst are clutch pressure plates, which can be way off, even brand new sachs
units. I just had an engine balanced and the sachs (brazil) PP needed tons
of work to get it balanced. I don't do this work myself, it is done at a
specialist shop, but I get a rundown afterwards on what parts need balancing
from the shop, just so I know what's what. The factory balancing tolerances
for our engines were pretty wide, and you can hear and feel the difference
in a balanced engine. It is a very good investment to have your parts
professionally done.
