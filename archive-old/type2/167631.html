Subject: injectors, aren't??

the continuing saga of the 78 2liter FI engine.  I can get engine to start
from ether, but the injectors are not firing.

have gone thru the troubleshooting guide step by step
(remember this was a working engine before putting a new long block in.)

every step.

. test light at injector does not flicker weakly.

. double relay works fine (35psi fuel presure)
. trigger impulse is present at term #1 of control unit
. correct voltage on pins # 10-5  10-16 and 10-17

conclusion, control unit defective

but I have several spares and have tried em, what are the odds of 6
control units having the same defect???  I've never seen a bad control
unit in almost 20 years of driving a FI VW....

still at none of the injector plugs do I get the &quot;weak flicker&quot; and I've
seen it often enough to know what it looks like...

what else is left, nice fat spark, lots of presure, engine will start and
run on ether, (for a moment or so)

????????

thanks
Bob
