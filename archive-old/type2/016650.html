&gt;&gt; 2) where is the best place to install a bilge blower, up towards the front,
I think the front-slightly less degrees to deal with and shorter wire
from the switch
&gt;. are you seeing    way better heat ?? or is there just a
&gt; little improvement ??
a moderate improvement in my old way rusty 70- it made it so the
windshield would stay clear and that's a big deal- a gas heater unless
integrated into the front ducts like the 74-79 factory heater won't do
much for the windshield.
&gt; purchase a gas heater...at this point doing either one seems to be a pain
&gt; in the ass, and I dont want to waste my time and effort going with the
&gt; wrong setup....thanks....Keith
Want it really nice- do both, double pain
