List folk-


Not Bus-specific, but at least Bus-applicable:

My buddy mail-ordered a gas tank for his Bug and it arrived with a 
questionable paintjob.  It was a bit tacky on the outside and somewhat 
smudgeable, and tackier and wetter (almost like petroleum jelly) and makes 
your fingertip black when you probe around inside the filler hole.

a)  This is normal.  The tank is OK.  Go ahead and install it as is.  Happy 
motoring.

b)  This is normal.  The tank has to be treated by the user somehow before 
installing.

c)  This ain't right.  Send the tank back for a replacement.

d)  Why even deal with it?  Send the tank back for a refund.  Take the old 
tank to a shop and have 'em fix the weld around the threaded outtake 
receptacle from where gas appears to be seeping.  Then clean and treat the 
tank with a marine coating.

Thanks-
