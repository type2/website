I worked last year for a FLAPS. They were allowing returns for anyone not 
satisfied.Yes I told everyone, they were junk.

&gt;  We got a shipment of those little heaters you plug into your cigarette
&gt;  lighter, that are designed to clear the fog from your windshield. They
&gt;  claim to put out HUNDREDS of BTU's. Pay attention here because a butane
&gt;  cigarette lighter probably would be rated in the hundreds too. &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I posted this a couple of weeks ago, that these things are worthless. I hope,
&gt;at least, you didn't pay for it, or can return it.  When you say &quot;we got a
&gt;shipment,&quot; I assume you work for a place that sells these stupid little
&gt;&quot;heaters&quot;? If so, I hope when a customer asks if they work, you'll tell them
&gt;the truth. You'll generate more heat from a fart than these things can
&gt;produce!    Jeff S.
