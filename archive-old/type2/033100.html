Subject: WorthDying?Sequel

Hi faded curtain interest group.
Several p-mailers asked me to share what I found out about how to dye our 
stock curtains and which product is best to use.
I had several well intended responses and suggestions. We contacted dye 
makers and ordered catalogs.
Dyes, all agree, only work on natural fabrics like wool, silk, cotton etc.
Our stock curtains are man made fibers and are colored during their 
manufacture.

Karl put it simply and accurately: 

Man made poly fibers-can not dye them. :(
