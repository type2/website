Subject: Re: [T2] Bus sighting [It's Friday]

watching a re-run of Seinfeld just the other night
i saw a bay.

went by real quick, but it looked like it had the
lower turn signals, so likely a 68-72 variety.

Kramer hanging out in the back with the dope-smokin'
hippies was of course hilarious.

happy friday,

Joel Wilson
