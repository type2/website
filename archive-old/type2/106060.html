&gt; awkward place like that too, but you couldn't change

&gt; the headbanger shelf above the bed or in the side of
&gt; the closet. Yes the radio, not just the speakers.

I take the time when I drive to get some peace and quiet (well as much as
is possible in a bus) enjoy the scenery and listen to a 4banger do it's
