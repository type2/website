Subject: heating while driving

I just returned from Europe, where I picked up an item for about
$21 which should interest most of you.  As usual, hindsight is
better than any other type, and I know wish I'd brought back a
shipload of these things.

Anyway, it is a very simple 12v (plug into yer cig. liter) mat
almost like a simple seat cover which hooks via elastic to
your seat and warms your back and bottom sides as you drive.
It literally warms up within block or two of being plugged
in, and has not yet once blown a fuse in my Passat at least.  I
like using it on cold mornings while I'm waiting for the regular
heating system to warm up.  


These things sort of exist in the US, but they are heavier,
bulkier, more complicated, take a long time to heat up, and are
very expensive.  They are also hard to find.  In Germany, the
unit I bought was nearly everywhere to be seen - in department
and even grocery stores, now coming out for the cold weather, I
think.  

At any rate, I plan to have some more sent/brought over for
Germany, especially for my air-cooled VW's.  If any of you
have friends or relatives over there - you might want to
plead and beg for them.  I'd say they work better than many
cars on the market today which have heated seats built in - like
the Volvo, Audi, MBZ, etc., at least better than the ones I
experienced a few years ago in a Volvo.
