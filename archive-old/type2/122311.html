have any of you NON-westy bus owners (deluxes, hard-top campers, etc)
ever replaced your ratty vinyl headliners with some westy-style wood
(or masonite) paneling?

In the westys there is a small metal strip that is secured to the body that
the headliner fits into.  Without the strip, the headliner would not want to
stay to the curve of the roof, I'm sure glue would be a waste of time, that
heavy headliner material doesn't want to bend easily and the glue couldn't
hold it.
