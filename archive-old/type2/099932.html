Subject: poptop conversion? 

hi there list,
i'm in need of some advice on replacing the 
poptop on my 70'Westie. i've located a lid 
that's in decent condition, but it's from a 
73camper?.?. it has the front luggage rack where 
my 70'has a rear luggage. 
i prefer the newer set-up. with the ability of 
adding weight to the front of the bus instead of 
the rear. 
and after takin some quick measurements at the 
junkyard, it looks like it'll work. but i was 
wanting to double check with u all, and get your 
opinions on the idea. 
thanks for your time and attention. any advice 
will be much appreciated.
