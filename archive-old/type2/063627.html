Hey Ron,
You forgot about the always popular and everybodys favorite
66 DELUXE MICROBUS, 23 windows, with canvas sunroof, exc throughout,
$9000 or best
offer. (203) 776-3615 

I assume these adds have been coming from the bargainnews at
http://www.bargainnews_dot_com Which is a free to advertise paper in the Ct
area. A great paper which I have gotten many VWs by and am also trying
to see my ghia by.
