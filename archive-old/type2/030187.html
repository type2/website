&gt; George,

&gt; I kinda disagree with you on this issue.
&gt; 
&gt; My 74 Westy has had a K&amp;N for 33,000 miles, or all it's life.
&gt; 
&gt; My 85 GL has had a K&amp;N for 177.000 miles or half of it's life
&gt; 
&gt; My 86 BMW 325E has had a K&amp;N for 227,000 miles or all of it's life
&gt; 
&gt; My 86 Honda Goldwing has had a K&amp;N for 123,000 miles or all of it's
&gt; life.
&gt; 
&gt; If a vehicle is used for traveling down the big asphalt ribbon, the
&gt; chances of ingesting mass doses of abrasives is limited.

This is the key point.  If you stick to the pavement you could just about
run velocity stacks with impunity.  However, my real world has dirt roads
on it and I make use of them fairly often.  You probably wouldn't take
your BMW, or Wingabago on these roads, but buses are made for this sort of
thing.
 
&gt; None of my vehicles present or past have been without the benefit of K&amp;N
&gt; filtration.
&gt; 
&gt; And none of my current vehicles use one ounce of oil between periodic
&gt; maintenance.

Well, I'm obviously not going to sway you.  I used to think along the same
lines, but I eventually figured out that race parts weren't always ideal
for street use.  Unfortunately, accessory stores don't make much money by
telling you that the stock parts work best, so a lot of misinformation got
created to support sales.
 
&gt; One more thought----My 76 TT 500 Yamaha dirt bike has had a  K&amp;N since
&gt; it was new, and the upper end has never been apart due to filtration
&gt; failure.( or for any other reason either)

How many miles have you _really_ put on that bike in conditions where you
were continuously surrounded by dust?  That's the environment that a bus
engine lives in any time you drive down a dirt road, since the engine is
in the back of the vehicle.  Bikes take their air from under the seat,
which is usually away from the dust.
 
&gt; K&amp;N filters, has been an excellent addition to any vehicle I have ever
&gt; installed them on, when properly maintained.

I liked K&amp;N filters back when I was racing motorcycles.  I never DNFed due
to a filter clog, my sponsor rebuilt my engines when needed, and if I
managed to finish well there was a little contingency money from K&amp;N.

Now that I pay for my own engines I use filters with smaller pore sizes!
