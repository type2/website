Subject: RE: '71 electical diagnostic terminal

My recently sold '71 had the test network. I also had the European-style bed
up top. I concluded that the bus came over from Europe with a serviceman or
woman...so, like so many other things, maybe it was a Euro-option sooner
than it was an option over here.

Never used it for actual testing, but I did steel juice from it a couple of
times. Pretty handy.

&gt;I just took another look at the Bentley manual's electrical schematic.
&gt;It says that the test network was included in buses starting in January
&gt;1971, though the &quot;1971&quot; model cars had been in production since
&gt;mid-1970.
&gt;
&gt;My previous bus was also a '71 (it was a passenger bus with a front
&gt;bench seat), but it didnt' have the test network terminal. It did,
&gt;however, have a few mystery wires that I suspect might have been part of
&gt;the test network.
&gt;
&gt;The wiring diagram includes terminal numbers, so I know which part of
&gt;the socket goes to which bit of the electrical system. Just from looking
&gt;at it, I could see how to use it to get dwell and tach info. However,
&gt;the connections to the coil, the generator, the starter, and the
&gt;regulator suggest that there are tests that would allow me test these
&gt;components conveniently. I'm not sure what those tests would be.
&gt;
&gt;Somewhere out there I know that there are specs on this. Anyone out
&gt;there have the manuals that the VW dealer mechanics used?

&gt;&gt;?? the 71's didn't have that diagnostic stuff ... it wasn't until about
&gt;&gt;late 72 or so, i think. i know the 73's DID have it. my 71 bus (non-camper)
&gt;&gt;didn't have it, anyway.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;and you do NOT want one of those machines! ;) it was about the size of a
&gt;&gt;refrigerator!! i doubt if any still exist.
