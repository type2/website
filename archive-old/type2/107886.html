Subject: RE: [T2] strob light bulb replacement?

&gt; Where does Grace have a strobe light installed?

rofl,.... how fun would it be to have a party in that bus.  unless
you were epileptic of course, and then it would really bite.  Maybe
it's in the dome light.  Or possibly a fog light attatchment?  I
couldn't see it being part of the head light unless of course you
were living in the State of Confusion, U.S.A.

I saw a police car with a directional strobe once.  It was military
police and they were using it to spot a guy that was hiding in some
tall brush.  The strobe effect made him stand out as he was moving
from cover to cover, whereas the human eye can't see the movement in
the dark so easily with a solid beam.  Hmmmm  Volkswagen bus police
cars in the U.S. in the 21st century? ponder ponder.

On a serious note.  If it is just a standard modular strobe light it
has everything to do with the manufacturer as _some_ strobes are gas
injected and actually require boxed disposal because even an inert
bulb has high pressure gas in it.  Some units can have a bulb
swopped out, but they are high end and usually for light shows,
etc..  The small ones for your house that are found at Radio Shack
are disposable.  If you have one of those, it's a fixed unit.
