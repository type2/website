Subject: Re: [T2] SVDA and Kadrons

Hey Larry
      any info you want about the Kadrons set up  you should contact AJ Sims 
at  _http://lowbugget_dot_com/_ (http://lowbugget_dot_com/)  He truly is the  Kadron 
expert. He can tell you what jets and any other info you need to make  them 
work.
 
Why anyone is still buying from aircooled_dot_net  is beyond  me , I  see he's 
selling bus backing plates at twice the price of anyone else.
 
 
Mario
