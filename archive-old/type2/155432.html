Hi John,

I put a  Pertronix on my bus in the fall of 2002, so far it has  
served me well for over 32,000 miles with no problems or need for  
adjustment. It's actually been on three different engines over this  
period.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; I wonder how many people  have 40,000 trouble-free miles on a  
&gt; Pertronix?  The
&gt; two I had didn't last 10,000...............
