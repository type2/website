&gt;Thanks for the answer  BUT mine dont work that way (at least not in their
&gt;present state.  So can I adjust them?  I mean, they work so well in the
&gt; opposite harmony that they are in right now, it looks like it is designed
&gt;that way.  Ones open, others closed.  and they switch when I pull the wire
&gt;down.  If you can explain anymore, please enlighten me.

It's normal for them to move in opposite directions.  Look closely at how
the air flows, especially on the drivers side, and you will see why it
works.  I think when you think the drivers side flap is closed, it is
actually open.
