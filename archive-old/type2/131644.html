Subject: Exhaust Fastner Help

Woohoo Freakin Friday! Hi all I am going to buy some fastners today for my 
exhaust system and need a little help on Bolt, Nut and Washer sizes. I am 
looking for the 18 bolts nuts and washers to connect the HEs, muffler, and 
U-Pipes. Anybody have the appropriate sizes available, I am at work and 
don't have my Bentley. The ones I pulled off, the threads of the bolts 
barely made it through the nuts and the were all different sizes. I would 
like to find the correct ones.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
