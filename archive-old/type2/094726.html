Subject: RE: [T2] how hot?


Basically I hooked up my head temp gauge and as this engine has broken in:
head temps started out around 350-400 at 60 mph cruise, now they are at
400-450+ and even though it runs great I am worried that it will blow on a
long trip from Atlanta to West &quot;by God&quot; Virginia I have planned. Oil temps
are below 210.  It is a Type 1, 1835 DP with Solex progressive carb, Engle
110 cam, 7.6:1 compression, dual QP exhaust.  Like I said, I have a hunch
that the 2nd barrel of the carb is jetted too small causing it to run lean
at fast cruise.  Also considering lowering CR a few points, comments?
Timing is 009 at 8 btdc. (flame on)

Thanks!

Holes burned in pistons are usually from timing making the spark fire too
early where the engine starts to &quot;ping&quot;.  Extremely hot heads may cause the
valve seats to come loose.

Why are your heads running hot?  Are you not driving your air cooled engine
correctly?  Driving technique and incorrect timing seems to be the major
cause of overheated heads.

I pull a 1300 lb Scamp with my 2L'76 westy up mountain passes with an engine
that is getting close to 180,000 miles and no overheating on the heads.  Oil
will run 260 with 40 pounds pressure when we were close to 10,000 feet.


&gt; I am wondering if anyone knows from experience a head temp that burned a
&gt; hole in a piston. I know my heads are running too hot but I plan to fix it
&gt; soon, might be caused by 2nd barrel of solex progressive too lean.  What
is
&gt; the max head temp you would run for a short trip?  (or what temp would you
&gt; stop and pull over)
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
