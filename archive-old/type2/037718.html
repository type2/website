Subject: P-Brake Lever Question/Comment

'Morning Folks,
       Over the last weekend I posted my findings on why my parking has never 
worked in three years, the levers were reversed. A while back I noticed the 
levers were attached to the shoes with stainless steel bolts and those nylock 
(sp?) nuts, which seem to hold the levers on just fine, even if they were on 
backwards. At that time I ordered the correct anchor pin and &quot;horse shoe&quot; 
type clip, which I installed when I flipped the levers. The horse shoe clip 
does not fit too well around the pin (yes, I had it in the slot in the pin), 
and I had to crimp it with a pair of pliers to get it to stay on, but even at 
that it doesn't look too secure. Had I checked this out in advance, I'd have 
gone looking for a circlip to fit the end of the pin, rather than this horse 
shoe type clip. Anyone have any trouble with these clips falling off? (Not 
original clips if you still have them, I'm wondering about replacements 
ordered in the last year or two) I don't want my parking brake hardware 
coming apart while I'm on the way to Everybus!      TIA,    Jeff S.
