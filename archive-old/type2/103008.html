Subject: Re: [T2] fuel cutoff solenoid

&gt;If you are installing a cutoff solenoid in your fuel
&gt;line and are having problems with &quot;trapped pressure&quot;
&gt;you might consider controling the solenoid with a time
&gt;delay relay. If you can quantify the time required to
&gt;allow for pressure stabilization after shutting off
&gt;the engine, then you can set the time delay to leave
&gt;the solenoid open for that period of time and then
&gt;shut off.

I'm sure I've missed something here important but where is the trapped 
pressure?

The solenoid I plan to use (once I locate and buy it) will be right at the 
gas tank so that when it is off there is no way for fuel to leak out (in 
case of fire). If the valve is anywhere else you've got fuel line between 
the tank and the valve that can leak, burn, or fall off.

In my '78's case it will be gas tank, valve, filter, pump, engine.

As I see it if I close the valve when the engine running it is just going 
to stall as if it ran out of gas.

I'm sure I'm missing something that you guys are getting at so please 
correct me.
