&gt; &gt;&gt;I'm showing my love for my bus by pulling the engine due to a slight
dizzy
&gt; &gt;&gt; mishap (Dad dropped the dizzy shaft spring into the engine block).

The most direct access to the camshaft gear cavity is obtained
by removing the oil pump. The large round bottom cover at the rear
should be removed, and a rag pushed up inside to block the small
port to the right of the cam gear. The cavity is essentially blocked
from the rest of the case except through this port.
A magnet and compressed air should do the rest.
Or you could try standing the case on this end and shake it. ( Really ! :)
