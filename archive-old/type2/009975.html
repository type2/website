I just bought the new Dixie cups w/ the 60's style designs on them.One of 
the designs is made up of what are supposed to be vw buses, so of course I 
had to buy them.They'll be great for the camping events this summer.Most 
major grocery stores probably carry them.They can be found near the other 
paper cups,plates and such.
