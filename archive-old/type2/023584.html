Greetings from behind the Orange Curtain in SoCal---
     
Saw these within a few miles of each other---

It had to happen dep't:  A lowered Westfalia pop-top.  Yup, a dropped '68-'70,
with tiny tires and a dinky steering wheel.  A real POS.

Dr. Frankenstein lives dep't:  This was a real piece of work---a Westfalia
crewcab!  Someone had chopped off a hardtop Westy (or bus w/camper windows,
couldn't see) behind the sliding door and added a tiny pickup bed.  Possibly
the goofiest bus I've seen, and......it's for sale!  See it in Costa Mesa on
Placentia Ave. between Victoria and 19th.  Hurry, it could be yours!

Regards, Matt Q.
