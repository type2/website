Subject: Electrical System Question?

Dear All,

On a camping trip to the Arizona desert last weekend my 79 Westy failed to 
start.  I later learned, after a one-hour trip to Sedona, that my battery was 
pushing out about 12.9 volts.  I suspected the starter solenoid or starter.

I enlisted my 3 year-old to help me take the starter and starter solenoid off 
and after much disassembly we succeeded.  I made sure to note where all the 
wires went by taping the wires together.  The only thing is that my little 
&quot;helper&quot; unfastened the tape and now I'm not sure about the wiring.  I think 
that the large grey wire or ground wire goes on the shorter (30) solenoid 
bolt, and that the positive battery wire, the hot engine wire, and two other 
red wires  (not sure what they are) all go to the other longer (50) solenoid 
bolt.  Does this sound right to anyone?

The thing is that after replacing the starter and solenoid, the car started 
just fine.  The only thing was that the red battery light came on and stayed 
on.  I figured that it was either the voltage regulator, or the alternator.  I 
replaced the voltage regulator and still had the red light.  So I figured, it 
must be the alternator right?; I had it tested and sure enough it isn't 
working right either.

Is there something that would cause both the starter solenoid and alternator 
to fail simultaneously?  Could I have fried the alternator by connecting one 
too many red wires to the starter solenoid?  Would appreciate any thoughts.

Thanks,
