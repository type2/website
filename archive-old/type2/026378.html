	Whoops+ACE-  Sorry everyone.  I think that last message went out in HTML
format.(Self flagellation in progress)

	Hi Bob (and List),
Here's a strange question for you(all).  I have a '70 transporter that I
picked up for a song and dance, as it was missing the drivetrain(the body
was primo).  I have since, dumped major dinero into the aforementioned
locomotive.  Well, she has the factory air installed, but when you mount the
compressor/bracket combo, the D/S heater duct gets in the way.  I was
dumbfounded about this until recently, when I saw a beetle with a
side-mounted duct on the D/S for just this purpose.  This shroud was a
factory(or dealer installed) original, I am sure of it.  Does anyone out
there know ofanyone or anywhere that I can get ahold of one(or more) of
these?  I would like to install the A/C(and try out that new Freeze R-12
replacement) since we have surpassed the century mark in temps
here(Sacramento) lately.  Besides, when the next blackout rolls by me, I'll
have a cool and cozy place to crawl off to.  Thanks ahead of time+ACE- (I have
faith in all listees)

	Eron Crites


Getting ready for the Pomona Show today, and discovered I have three OE
dog-house fan shrouds. Wasn't someone looking for one of these last week?
