Subject: front sway bar clips

i'm about to take off my front stablizer bar, in order to get the torsion 
arms off. The bentley manual says just replace the clips, but that was 
written 20 years ago.  Are they still available, or better yet, is there a 
trick to saving them when removing them? If not, is there a trick to setting 
the new ones, if found, back in place with regular ol' shade tree type tools?
tia,
