Subject: Re: '71 Brake Caliper overheating theories

Ron,
Let me say first that I do not suspect the rear brakes are causing the front to
overheat. Rears provide minimal braking force. If one rear was working and the
other not, you would probably be able to feel a pull, but I have seen instances
where owners were totally unaware that both rears were totally non functional
for years. 

That out of the way, let's lookit the front. Yes, it is possible (likely) that
the side opposite the overheating caliper isn't functioning properly and causing
the functioning caliper to overheat, especially since you mention pulling to the
side during braking. The pulling could be coming from the rear, tho. Or
misaligned/worn front end. Take the van for a test near home. In an open area,
unpopulated by cars, people, lamp posts, etc. bring the van up to 30 MPH or so.
Brake hard (lock 'em up). Check the skid pattern. If the hot caliper is the only
one that locks up, you've found your problem. A less radical (and less
informative) test would be to exit a freeway, pull over and feel both the front
wheels. If only one side is hot, probabilities are high that only one caliper is
functioning. 

If you need a new caliper and you can't afford a new ATE (prolly around $125),
get down to a local discount auto parts store (Chief, something like that.
Probably not available at Pep Boys or the like, but possibly. Point is, I found
them at an unlikely source). Rebuilts can be had for around $45. They'll last a
couple of years. If the working side got real hot, I'd consider
rebuilding/replacing that, too.
You mentioned that you replaced the metal and rubber brake lines. Was this
because of internal damage (rust)? Reason I ask is because most calipers start
to leak before they quit moving (unless they've rusted internally due to sitting
a long time with moisture present). Check the front pads/rotor that don't appear
to be working for contamination, something that could reduce the effectiveness
of the braking material.

&quot;If at first you don't succeed...&quot;
