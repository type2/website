Subject: 82: Oil leak between #1/2 cyl/case
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSI.4.05L.9810251633530.29980-100000_at_FinallY.atlasta_dot_net&gt;


Hey folks.

Went to change the oil on moms 82 today, and noticed oil on the right
heater box, and on the engine bearer, etc.

Pulled the lower tin, to see if it was a pushrod, or what, and see that
apparently it is leaking from between the base of the cylinders and the
case.  It doesnt appear to be a pushrod, or seal.  

Dont have an opportunity at the moment to do a compression test,  but my
first guess is that the head has come loose, and doing this.  Would also
explain what I though sounded like an exhaust leak, too....*sigh*

Anyone have any other ideas/suggestions?

thanks...david (who's to damn tired for this crap today...*sigh*)
