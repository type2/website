&gt; That's also the way I do it.  There are some that insist you affect the
&gt; valve clearance by turning the engine backwards, but I have not seen any ill
&gt; effects.

well FWIW, I always start at 4 and do one side 4,3 then the other 2,1
turning the engine clockwise. the only problem with turning it backwards,
I have occasionally losened the bolt when compression was high.

but then I have a hydraulic now so rarely touch the valves anyway
