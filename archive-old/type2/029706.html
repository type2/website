&gt; I've been reading the archives regarding this subject.  Certainly fodder for
&gt; debate.  Seems like most folks prefer the simple, easy-to-fix attributes of
&gt; the stock generator.  Mine just gave up the ghost.  Probably just needs
&gt; brushes, $5 plus my time.  I don't put huge demands on my generator: mild
&gt; stereo -- no amplifier, 35w incandescent fog lamps, 55/60w H4s.  My mechanic
&gt; says he'll install an alternator for about $200.  I guess this includes a
&gt; new stand.  Doesn't seem too expensive to me.
&gt; 
IF it's just brushes, replace 'em and be happy.  The alternator is nice,
but it's not _that_ much better!

Unless you're running RTTY, the generator will be fine.

&gt; One more question: I don't have the '68 owner's manual yet. I figured out
&gt; real fast that the red light on the left is the gen light.  Nothing is
&gt; labeled.  What's the green one just opposite on the right?  Oil pressure?
&gt; I'm getting new senders and pressure/temp gauges this week or next.

It's oil pressure.  Should be on after you turn the key on and before you
crabnk the engine.  If it's not, fix it!
