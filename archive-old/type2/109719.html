  eugene OR

&gt; Hmm, a neighbor here in NJ bought some land there- sounds like a great place
&gt; to retire if you don't want 65% of your taxload to go to the schools where
&gt; you have no kids......

I'm sorry, but this reall, really strikes a nerve with me. The idea behind a
public school system supported by taxes paid by everyone is to better SOCIETY
as a whole - not just provide education or baby sitting for your own kids.

Or would you rather retire someplace that doesn't have public schools (and no
taxes) but hordes of uneducated children roaming the neighborhoods?

Stepping off the soap-box...

-Eric
