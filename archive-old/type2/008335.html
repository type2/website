Subject: Chopping '78 roof
Date: Sun, 14 Feb 1999 18:43:53 -0500
Message-ID: &lt;19990214233813417.AAA297.308_at_default&gt;

I recently bought a '78 van before the kidney foundation came to get it. 
However, the rear half of the roof has been used as a dance floor and has a
huge depression over the rear seat.  There is also a lot of rust around the
gutter and a rust seam opening up in the right corner, running down to the
waistline.  Since this will be a work vehicle (so I won't have to haul dead
animals around in my westfalia)  I am thinking about making it into a
pickup type vehicle.  I am thinking about cutting about a foot behind the
seats back and at the waistline.  Anyone seen/done this kind of thing?  Or
anyone who can't stand to see a bus butchered want to make me an
offer.....it runs, its cheap.

Patrick
