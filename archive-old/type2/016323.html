 HIPPY HOORAY!!!! &quot;BESSIE&quot; the hippy bus is now being put together by
The Old Volks HOME in AZ.,

This bus was saved from being cut up for parts!! it was sold when i
tried to buy it --but when they found out i was going to keep &quot;Bessie&quot;
back on the road-- they gave the money back to the 1st buyer and sold it
to a happy old hippy--uncle jerry--
