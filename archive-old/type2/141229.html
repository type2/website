Subject: CB Radio Antenna install

So .. I recently installed a CB Radio Antenna on the rear bumper of my 78. 
I got this mirror mount thing at Flying J's for like $11.00.  I threw away 
half of it and the other half mounted nicely in one of those holes that are 
on the bottom of my rear bumper.  The mount sticks out about 1 1/2&quot; from my 
rear bumper.  I had a fiberglass antenna that screwed right in.  It only 
goes as high as the rain gutter of my roof and so ... is about 6&quot; or so 
shorter than the top of my pop-top.  I haven't wired it up yet and I'm 
hopefull that I can squeeze the cable through the front without drilling a 
hole.

Anyway - so - will this antenna work properly - or optimally - I kinda doubt 
it but ... if not what should I do ... get a longer antenna that goes about 
my pop-top? ... if so how high should it go ... 6&quot; or 3' or what?

TIA
