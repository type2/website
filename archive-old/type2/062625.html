Nope, no pictures. I used to see them tooling around the university, 
though. It was a fairly common site (maybe 10 or 15 years ago) because I 
used to think it a shame. These were the rigs w/ truck tires, and the 
outer fender wells cut off the van. Somehow, they never got past this 
point to actually raising the vehicle and doing other mods.

One of my first major repair jobs was helping a friend weld the fenders 
back on the back of one of the busses.
