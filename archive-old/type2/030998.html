&gt; Testing at my injector, I get a solid light when turning over the engine
 (it's not firing). Is that the ballast resistor or the ECU's fault? or
 something in between. The brain needs a signal from the dizzy to tell it 
when to apply voltage, right? Maybe I've got something wired wrong there?

OK let me see if I can explain, now that I have my FI manual in front of
me.

term 88z should have power
     86c should not have power with ignition switch on engine not running

at the injector the light should flicker. if not check term 1 on the coil
as you should be getting a trigger impulse 

put test light between pin 1 on the control unit plug and ground for the
following test, then crank engine


       if the light does not flicker check
. break in wire between term1 on distributor and term 1 on Control unit
multi pin conector (not the ECU itself)
.  points not adjusted correctly
.  condenser shorting to ground
.  defective coil


hope this gets you started.
if not we need to get into a step by step trouble shooting series.  or if
you can find it the VW &quot;Troubleshooting Guide, Electronic Fuel Injection
AFC&quot;  VW # 0.00.530.410.23 (don't know if it is in the library as I have a
copy and never looked)

Good luck

&gt; 
&gt; And Sean, your description of Steve's problem is very close to my own. I keep thinking my ignition switch is worn out, but maybe it has something to do with wiring...or maybe that worn solenoid has some impact on the FI system...like maybe there's not enough voltage coming in to part of the FI system to trigger a critical event?

&gt; Thanks! Joe
