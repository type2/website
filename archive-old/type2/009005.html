Since this happens at a consistant rpm range, I'd discount intermittance in
the head temp sensor or in the air intake temp sensor  found in the flow
meter.  Based on the Bosch troublshooting manual, make sure that all is
well with the ignition system...even a weak coil can create such symptoms
at high rpm's.  Check the spark with a timing light, all 4 cyl- any
dropouts at the rpm range you notice this in?  I'm curious- if you try  a
high throttle condition with low rpms (chugging up a hill, which requires
more gas, more air), I'd think the rpm range this happens would change if
it's the air flow meter or something wierd in your timing advance?    I'm
confused by your words &quot;accellerate through&quot;..you mean at higher rpms it
runs ok- or do you mean that because you step on it, the change in air flow
lets the air flow meter find another spot on the resistance track and give
info to the ECU?

1. Check for &quot;sticking&quot; or stiffness of the flap in air flow meter- clean
the sides carefully where it swings in.

2.Try swapping the air flow meter or changing the track its resistance arm
rides on.   One can check this with an ohmeter (see if the varying
resistance drops to infinity at any point in the air flap range).  Check
Bentley for the curcuit feeding this.

3. Check for blockage or kinking in the fuel line, low fuel pressure (pump
or return regulator).

 4. Consider leaks in air intake system, but this is unlikely based on your
symptoms.
