So when i was on my way to get more Zero-Rust for coat number two on my
cargo floors i passed a garage sale.  I found a Church Key, the kind
sort of shaped like a T, unlike the P shaped one i already have.  What's
the deal on these.  Seems like the T shaped one is much older and that
maybe my P shaped one was an after market thing the PO picked up.  I
also found a mirror that is identical to my bus and it even has glass.
Probably a handy thing to have, who knows what Yahoo may decide to hit
one of my mirrors some day.  Seems that the people who live in the house
holding the garage sale are selling stuff that the previous owner's had
left behind, they were very old and had a bus. Cool hey.

Anyway, they had 4 or 5 boxes of bearings, i forget the manufacturer -
but it started with a T.  I had bearings from the same manufacturer that
i bought at the SKF dealer and they told me that they were made in
France.

Anyway, i didn't buy them because i had no idea  what they were for, all
i knew for sure was that they would not fit my front wheels because they
were too small.  Id say that they were to my outer front bearings, as my
outer front bearings are to my inner front bearings - roughly.

My question, is there a way to figure out whether or not these bearings
would go somewhere on a VW, and where?  There were also some vintage
F*#d parts there so these could have been for an old F*#d.

Anyway

Thanks again everyone.
