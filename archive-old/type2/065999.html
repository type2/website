Subject: Re: Painting small rust spots

Bren,

I used an acid (can't remember it's name) recommended by my panel beater, 
and then sprayed the spots with a clear paint from a spray can. 

The body looks messy anyway so the fact that the clear paint has a 
slightly yellow tinge doesn't really matter. 

Anyway, if I don't wash the bus, I can't tell the difference. Most of the 
time I can't tell the difference. In fact, on reflection, I can't tell the 
difference all the time.

On another related point, Joe Fournier asked John where he was going to keep 
his bus after he had it painted. I recently asked myself the same question. 

After discussion with my SO (my wife of 25 years today) we agreed that,  
instead of raising a loan for the bodywork on the bus, we would raise a 
loan for a garage for the bus. 

Australians have a tradition of doing things in their shed. One of our folk 
troubadors, John Williamson, even wrote a song about them (&quot;Every Aussie 
bloke needs a shed - to think about the things his woman said&quot;). 

My shed will be big enough for my bus, my bench, my motorbike and all my  
important junk. It will have a pit so I can work on the bus without lying 
on the ground and it will have a fridge, of course, for when I've 
finished for the day.

The body work will have to wait another year. I always said it was a five 
year project when I bought the bus 18 months ago.
