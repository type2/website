Subject: [T2] 76 Westy Question (77 911s Porsche Engine)

Hello all,

While I'm waiting for parts to get my beast back up and running, I
thought I'd query this list of experts for opinions about a bus that I
have been drooling over for some time now.

At the following address

http://www.geocities_dot_com/fluidblu/

is a very nice looking 76 Westy Campmobile with a 77 911s engine in it.
I know almost nothing about these kinds of conversions but am intrigued
by the whole package. I think the original asking price for this bus was
around $9,000 which seemed a little high to me but again what do I know.

Anyway, my wife and I are planning a trip across/around the U.S.
(mainland) this summer and we have to do it in a bus! My bus here in
Hawaii is not worth shipping to the mainland and it probably wouldn't
make it out of California anyway.

Does anyone have any advice on a bus like this (the 911s conversion)??
Your expert advice will, as always, be greatly appreciated.
