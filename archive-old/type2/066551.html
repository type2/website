Subject: Re: VW CD - Defeat?

&gt;If the target of the Consumer CD is really consumers, then I think
&gt;you have to realise that not everyone with a car less than 10 years
&gt;old is going to do work themselves.  How many of _you_ actually
&gt;do any of the work on your own cars? Yet the product is probably

        Might not be a bad idea to mention college kids. The aircooled VW
has always been a very popular vehicle for the college crowd-and guess
what? They've all got cd-rom access in the school lab. Guess what else?
They can't afford to give a mechanic $60/hr to fix thier bug. Seems like
the alldata marketing folks need to remember thier college days...

Peace,
