Billy&quot; wfp3_at_lycos_dot_com Wrote: List, you guys are great, and lets follow
Dave R.'s advice and not use the list to get out our frustrations caused
by others. Aren't we a team here?
------------------
I want you guys to do me a favor and go look on your front doorstep and
see if my master cylinder for my 81 Vanagon is on your porch. It would be
a UPS package shipped from BusDepot.
If you have it you'll be relieving my frustrations.
