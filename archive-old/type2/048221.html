Subject: [T2] Elecrical problem Won't Start

Hey,
My 73 is giving me major headaches trying to find an electrical problem.
The Symptoms:
Alternator light comes on when you turn the bus off.  Cuts off when you turn
the bus on.  (I have been disconnecting the battery when I park so as to not
kill the battery.)
The other night driving home while trying to use my high beams, (which didn't
work) smoke starts coming from under the dash. I finally got to work on her in
the daytime and found what I think is the problem.  An original looking wire
going to fuse 8 bottom from back.  A Big fat red wire with a white stripe,
shows signs of burning.  I  have looked in the Bentley but can not find a
listing for a big red wire with a white stripe.  It seems that the emergency
flashers and the interior light are supposed to be running off of this fuse.
Any thing else?  She may start once but usually requires a jump to start a
second time (battery is not dead)????

The generator light is coming on and off intermittently while running now.  I
thought it may be the alternator but with the wire smoking in the front I am
not so sure any more.

I have replaced the relay for the head lights and need help... What else can I
look for?

TIA

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
