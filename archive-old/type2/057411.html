Subject: Best jack points for bus?

Now that I have all of the tools and equipment, I'll be jacking up my '71
loaf and going to work on the clutch cable and removing the rear wheels to
get at the hand brake cables.

I have Muir, and a Clymer repair manual, but they don't mention something
rather important -- what are the best points to (1) jack up the rear end
and (2) put jack stands under to hold it up?
