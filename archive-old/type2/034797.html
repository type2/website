Subject: shift knob extensions?

 I want to put the VDO 3 guage under dash console in.  My shift knob will hit 
it in first.  I've determined the thread on rod is a 12mm 1.5 thread, and 
I've fooled around with various plumbing fixtures to make some kind of wacky 
extension, but I just can't get it right.  Anyone know a source for some kind 
of metric threaded rod, 90's or couplers?  I've also heard of a bolt -on, but 
don't know where to get one that is '71 bus friendly.  I couldn't find 
anything in archives either.  Also, does anyone know if a little Sunpro tach 
will fit the VDO rubber console?
