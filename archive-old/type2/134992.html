Subject: Fresh air fan?  Vanagon upgrade for late bay??

I was helping a friend install a vanagon engine the other weekend and 
noticed how VW attached the fresh air fan to the alternator.  Has anyone 
figured out a way to use this on a late bay with a pancake engine?  This 
would blow air much stronger than the engine fan.

Any thoughts? Pros/cons?
