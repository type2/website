Subject: oil pressure ???

I have a 73-74 1600cc beetle engine {not sure of the year } on my trike 
...rebuilt approx. 2 years ago...I installed an oil pressure gauge ...my question 
is what should the oil pressure gauge read ??? ...when I first start the trike 
up the gauge reads about 40...as the engine warms it goes down to around 5 to 
7  when idling...at about 50 -55 MPH it reads approx 19 -20 ...is this right  
??? ...am I in the ball park ??? ...then at around 30 to say 45  MPH I'm 
running around 12 - 15  on the gauge....the motor runs great ...and sounds great 
...just alittle concerned about the pressure ...
any imput will be deeply appreciated...
thanks in advance...
