Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] Thermostat- to fit or not to fit?


&gt;&gt;  Once they are fully open, in a type 1 motor the flaps help direct the 
&gt;&gt;air
&gt;&gt;  from the fan shroud down over the heads and barrels and not just
&gt;&gt;circulating inside the fan shroud.
&gt;Don't know about a type 4, but I do not believe that to be the case in a 
&gt;type 1 motor.
&gt;
&gt;The shroud serves as the volute to the fan blade...

Type 4 again should disregard, I dont know. We dont know....


But the type I is a different story.

I decided to test both ways. I ran the bus without flaps and then with 
flaps, and I noticed a reduced temperature in heads and oil temp on the same 
stretch of road at approximatly the same speed. I had a 63 so dropping the 
engine was quick and painless. Put those flaps in weather or not you wire 
them open or use a thermostat (which by the way on the &quot;test&quot; I did not use 
a thermostat, they were wired open).
