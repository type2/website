Hey y'all
New e-mail address, I can actually get my mail with this one.  Tired of 
wrestling with the ISP over why I don't get all my mail. Time for a new ISP 
thinks I.

I was thinking about tunes and the Burrito Express.  It isn't yet time for 
the installed stereo route and I am loathe to buy D cells at the rate most 
boom boxes chew them at.  I looked around and found several that use 8 
D-cells for power.  Hmmm, 8x1.5=12 where I grew up.  So I bought a medium 
grade boom box the other day and popped the battery compartment open.  No, 
they weren't kind enough to include a set of batteries so it was either 
succumb to the battery cartel or use some creative engineering.  As usual, I 
chose the latter.

I found a D cell in the trash because I couldn't see buying one just to 
measure.  They are 2 3/8 long and 1 1/4 in diameter.  I went to the local 
hardway store and browsed for a bit, finally leaving with (3) 'leftover' 
pieces of 1&quot; schedule 40 PVC _at_ $0.50 each, and (2) 3/4&quot; copper pipe caps _at_ 
$0.49 each.

Returning to Chez Burrito, I dug out a spool of lamp wire (12 ga), 2 lugs, a 
couple small screws and nuts.  I soldered lugs and wires together.  Drilled 
small holes in center of pipe caps.  Ran screws into center of caps, 
attached lugs with nuts inside the caps.  The caps then fit in 2 of the 
lengths of PVC, screw heads out, wire doubling alongside the caps.  Drilled 
2 small holes in the PVC into the caps (from the side) and screwed small 
sheet metal screws to hold the caps into place.

I then looked in the battery compartment and saw the the 1st 2 batteries 
farthest in needed a (+) connection. {the compartment is arranged 2,3,3 
batteries}  I measured the adapter with the ribbed wire (deciding ribbed is 
+) and cut it to 4 3/4&quot;.  I measured the other adapter to 7 1/4&quot; and cut it 
there.  I also cut the third piece of pipe to 7 1/4 for use as a spacer 
where the middle batteries go.

I test fitted the long (closest to the door) adapter first.  It worked fine 
but I realized that I would have troubles with the tensioning spring for the 
flat side of the battery on the short adapter.  Went for a walk to the 
nearby woods, found a stick a bit less than 1&quot; diameter, stuck it in the 
short adapter, marked and cut.  Insert adapters like I would batteries, 
drilled a small hole to pass the wire out of the battery compartment.  
Mental note to add a strain reliever on the wire soon.  Trotted out to the 
Burrito Express, found a good 12v source and ground.

GLORY BE!  There be tunes in the Express!

I'd post pictures but the digicam needs batteries..... ;-)
