Subject: Re: [T2] Corvair Notes

And to think I let my high school sweetheart go.

Her father owned a Machine Shop and helped me create a few mechanical  
parts for my 57 Nash that were NLA.

I bet he would have been a real asset in this VW/Corvair endeavor.

Ah...young love. (I mean about my 57 Met!)

&gt; together we could use the parts I have as the models.  T
