Subject: Magnetic front window screens available
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I posted a question about making magnetic front window screens to the list 
about 10 days ago, and have gotten alot of positive feedback, so I am going 
to go ahead with my plan.

Here's the deal

You get: A set of two screens, one for driver side, one for passsenger.  They 
attach to the entire edge of window magnetically.  You can use your door and 
window as usual.  Each set is hand made by me using 1/2 inch magnetic tape, 
black fiberglass insect screen, and a hot glue gun.  They have performed 
quite well for me during the current camping season here in CT, so I decided 
to offer to make them for the list.

Price $24.00 a set includes shipping.  

Pictures can be seen after 6 p.m. on Friday 8/25 at:

If you can't view them, email me and I'll send you pic's.  Feel free to email 
me with any further questions or comments.

Let me know if you are interested, we'll work something out, and I'll get 
busy. (hopefully)


Thanks
