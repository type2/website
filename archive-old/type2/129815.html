Subject: 215 vs 210mm in a 1973 3-rib transmission

Hi Volks,

Here's a dumb question... will a 215mm clutch and flywheel fit in a 
1973 3-rib transmission bellhousing?

Last summer I pulled the 3-rib 73 tranny out of the westfakia and 
swapped in a 5-rib 1975 transmission in its place. At the same time I 
changed the clutch and flywheel to the 215mm parts, mostly because the 
215mm clutch disk I had on hand was in better shape than the 210mm disk 
was.

The 5-rib tranny has started singing to me under power in 4th gear, so 
I'm planning to swap back to the 3-rib next week, and need to know if 
the parts currently installed on the engine will fit into the &quot;new&quot; 
bellhousing.

If the 215mm clutch disk is still in good shape I suppose I could swap 
the bell housing, but I'd prefer to avoid that hassle if possible.

Thanks in advance,

Greg Potts
