Subject: [T2] Cup Holders:  2 for $8.95

I have obtained a closeout on fold-open cup holders, at a price of $8.95 for
a PAIR.

These look very similar to the original-equipment VW ones used on the late
model Vanagon Multivans and Weekenders. Like the originals, they fold up
flat against the wall or front seat pedastal when not in use.  They are
Taiwanese made replacements, and are blue. They are not as heavy-duty as the
original VW ones, but the genuine ones run $52/pair, which is ludicrous. At
$8.95/pair, these are certainly more than worth the money.  These can be
used on any VW van or bus.  The original locations (on those Vanagons that
had them) were along the side wall in the passenger area, and on some vans,
also on the insides of the front seat pedastals, but of course you can put
them anywhere you want. They simply screw in with two screws, which are
hidden when the cup holders are folded up.

Part number is 20213044B/2, and they will be on the website tomorrow (or you
can order toll-free by part number).  I will not have any more once these
are gone, so you may want to grab a couple of spares.
