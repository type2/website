Subject: WHEE!!! 55mph!

Well, for the first time ever, I took the bus over 45 miles an hour. 

Normally what happens is, at speeds around 40 miles an hour, the wheels
will start to wiggle. It will get progressively worse and worse until I
slow down. Kind of like how the feedback on a microphone only gets worse
until you turn the volumn down. Well, the problem (at least from what I
believe) seems to be from a BAD steering damper on my 73 Bus. I ordered a
new steering damper (and a few other items) from the Bus Depot, but they
probably won't arrive till this week. In any case, I was actually able to
get the Bus up to about 55 miles an hour without any problems.. no
shaking, etc. It was a VERY straight, and clean road, perfect for testing
it's speed.

I'm just curious by the way, I do have Muir's book, actually two copies..
his 19th Edition, and an older one. But I was just curious though what
the top speed of my 1973 Bus supposedly is. I don't want to know because
I want to go that fast, but I'd really like to know what the fastest
speed I can SAFELY, and RELIABLY go. I mean, what would be the fastest
speed I can cruise at while not overheating my Bus, and keeping the RPMs
within a safe speed?  Lets assume of course, that I have a completely new
suspension, and perfect tires (which I don't, but I will soon).

The motor is an 1800, hydraulic lifters, mechanical advance distributor,
a Webber 2-bbl carburetor, and the 4-speed manual.


Thanks!

Todd
