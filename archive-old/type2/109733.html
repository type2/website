Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Tank Sender

Similar (sort of) problem on my 79 FI.  Gas gauge wasn't working at all so
I carefully cut hole in the sloped interior metal above the tank -- this
repair is approved by VW but not to be undertaken lightly.  Replaced
sending unit with new one.  Now it works - reads full after filling up. 
Only problem is I run out of gas when the gauge is reading half full. 
Haven't been able to figure out what's wrong, but have heard that there is
something called a &quot;vibrator&quot; in the instrument panel that may need to be
replaced, but now I'm wondering if they sold me the wrong sender.  Looked
the same as the old one though.

&gt; The fuel gauge shows full when you fill up, then works it's way down to
&gt; empty. On the next fill up I only manage to get approx. 25 litres in the

&gt; Question is is it the sender causing the problem, sticking or something,
&gt; or could it be the actual gauge?
