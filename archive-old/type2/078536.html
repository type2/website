Subject: Kadron Vacuum Source

OK, here's the problem:
Went and installed a pair of 40mm Kadron carbs on my 1600 dp, no vacuum,
(AND I STRESS) temporarily installed an 009 distributor (save the flames,
please) so that it would run.  Do I need to tap the carbs for a vacuum
port somewhere?  I tried to tee into the balance tube, no cigar, so I'm
thinking the SVDA from aircooled_dot_net is the best solution.  Is there
a how-to somewhere?  I need to know from someone that's done this before
with these carbs.
Also, I read in the archives that performance is improved through the
use of shorter maniolds.  Where can I find these?  Is it true?
Thanks 

Slogging through the flat-spot of life...
