&gt; Why all of this paranoia about engine fires ?

I'm paranoid not only for my bus but also for my 411 (which someone
accurately pointed out on an earlier email that the 411 liked to burst
into flames)

Besides, I see this as no difference than getting full coverage insurance.
If I'm going to dump money onto my bus, spending a few extra hundred
dollars for a fire suppression system, plus your good advice of keeping
fuel lines in order, can only help not hinder.
