        There are so many variables here, it's hard for anyone to really
know where to start. How about some more info -- did you do a
compression check before you pulled it? Did you have the engine seal in?
( I know, I know -- I don't have a seal either, but that is one thing
that can add a lot of heat to the engine, so I'm told.) What did the
plugs look like? Maybe the FI is running too lean.
       It would have been a much better idea to have done some more
diagnosis before pulling the engine. See, here's the perfect example of
a need for guages -- it would be very helpful to know just what the oil
and head temps were running at, what sort of oil pressure, etc. Maybe
the oil cooler fins are plugged, maybe the oil pump is shot, maybe the
oil pressure relief valve is stuck. Maybe your fan hub key got sheared
like mine did and so the ignition timing is totally off, even though it
looks *right* when you set it.
      Lots of things can cause excess heat.
