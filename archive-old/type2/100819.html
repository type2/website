Subject: Re: [T2] What is a 091

I feel that this article from the library needs to be augmented.

The bastard transmission is simply a European 1600 transmission used
from 74 on (VIN 214 2000 001).
The 75 transmission in that article really is a 74 introduced with the
1800 engine.

I think were simply dealing with 4 transmissions in our T2bs - one for
each engine (1600, 1700, 1800, and 2000)

Here is what I have found in Stefan Doliwa's VW Transporter Book (Die
technische Dokumentation 1950 - 1990):
August 1, 1973 (1974 model) VIN 214 2000 001:
1600 engine - ring and pinion 7:38, 4th gear 62:51
1700 engine - discontinued
1800 engine - ring and pinion 7:34, 4th gear 27:24
October 1973 - Achsuebersetzung (what is the English term here?) from
11:49 to 11:48
August 1, 1975 (1976 model) VIN 216 2000 001:
ring and pinion from 7:34 to 7:38
gear ratios adapted to new engine

Hiya All,

Thanks to you all who helped straighten me out on Roberto's predicament
down 
in sunny Venezuela.  
Yes, I was aware of the General Strike.  Yes, I was aware of the long
waiting 
lines for gasoline.  
Unfortunately, I either misread or misunderstood Roberto's original
post.  I 
believe he had mentioned that, due to the strike, the only gas available
was 
uncertified.  That started me off on the track of, &quot;perhaps this
uncertified 
gasoline is lacking in some qualities&quot;.  And following that track I was 
wondering what adding oil to gasoline would accomplish in terms of
improving 
the quality of the gasoline.
I realize now that poor old Roberto is just trying to stretch his supply
of 
gasoline.  Sorry if I got anybody's nose out of joint - it surely was
not 
intentional.  I promise to work on my comprehension in the coming new
year.  
And for that matter, a Happy New Year to All - especially to Roberto.  I
hope 
things get back to normal for you.
