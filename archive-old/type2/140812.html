&gt; This is his 3rd alternator. I think he's done with alternators for now...

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

I missed the part about where he got the 3 alternators from.

Where did they come from?

Bosch alternators are different than Delcos and Ford alternators. They have 9 diodes instead of the 6 in the
others. All have the 3 pos and 3 neg in the rectifier bridge, but Bosch has 3 more for the exciter circuit.
99 out of 100 pimply faced kids at the 'test your alternator for free if you bring it in' machines don't have
a clue. They externally excite the field and the alternator works 100% of the times. &quot;Nope, the alt tests
fine...&quot;
Well, it is probably dead! If the 3 diodes are open, it is never going to work correctly. Put jumper cables on
backwards and poof! the smoke escapes from the diodes. Is this the vehicle that had the battery reverse
direction?
