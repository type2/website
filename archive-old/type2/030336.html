Volks, 

It appears we are finally all on line (YAY!) We have popped a couple
digests and I hope they keep coming out regular :-)  

In the intervening week a lot of mail passed, however, that did not go
to the digest list I am sorry to say.  I don't quite know how to get
it distributed :-(  The best solution I have thought of, and have
implemented is to put it all on my web site and publicize the address.  If
you point a browser at:

http://www2.ari_dot_net/dworkin/newlist

I have put all the posts the list received last week in tht directory.
Browse 'em, save 'em, whatever.

On the contributions, we have in the past week and a half (a) covered
Ron's match offer; and (b) with his match, covered the cost of the list
for a year!  I intend, this Friday, to post the first &quot;finance statement&quot;,
listing our current assets and the contributors.  If you requested
anonymity, you will not be listed.  If you want it, ask before Friday :-)
I will be posting assets, liabilities, and contibutors, but not individual
amounts.  In short, as of yesterday, with half a dozen checks unopened in
my pocket, we have ~$650 (the spreadsheet is at work :-) with Ron's $400,
that will raise us to $1150!

In addition, Thom has thrown in a stack of RAM for the current (borrowed)
machine and we are working on a donation of a machine of our own!

I would like to thank all of you very, very much.  It is an honor to be
associated with this group.
