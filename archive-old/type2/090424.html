Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust stud question and carb info needed 


&gt; The original spec was an 8x8 stud, as you have found.  The VW-supplied
&gt; repair for pulled studs was the 8x9 stepped stud and I have seen a *lot*
&gt; of them.  If you still have an 8mm hole, then I would say &quot;thank you&quot; and
&gt; head down to a *good* hardware store and buy an 8x8 stud (way easier to
&gt; find than the stepped stud in the real world) and install it.

Alas, I installed the 8x8 that I pulled from my spare engine and it does not
fit. Now I'm not sure if the hole is stripped or if it has been retapped
for an 8x9. If I have to retap, do I need to pop the head, or can I do it
safely in place?
