Kabayo, list:
IMHO, Dr. Tim really was 100% right a few months ago when he said get original
equipment  German shocks, (was it Boge or Sachs or are they the same?).
All 4 of my Vanagons have the original German shocks on the front  and they
still handle great and are not leaking. The 82 has 170,000 miles on it and for
the last 70,000 has been overloaded and HAMMERED and they still work. The rears
only stood up till 120,000 miles and finally started leaking, whereupon I put on
Bilsteins, which I don't think will last as long as the originals. I've used
KYB's and think they are probably pretty good, not as good as original
equipment, though.

&gt; IMHO, Gas A Justs are 'way too stiff for normal street use.  I've bought
&gt; KYB GR2s for three different cars so far, and I'm satisfied.  Slightly
&gt; stiffer than stock, w/ Japanese quality, and a modern low pressure gas
&gt; design.
&gt;
&gt; Beetle GR2s are less than $20, Bus slightly higher.

&gt;
&gt; .&gt;Yes, me again.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I installed REAR KYB gas adjust on the FRONT.  Guilty.  I should have
&gt; &gt;checked the stock numbers.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;This set up is tearing up the '78 Westy.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I will pull the front shocks off a '72, as an emergency R&amp;R.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Are these KYB gas adjust shocks any good??  I am super afraid to dump
&gt; &gt;another $60 into real front shocks if what I am hearing and feeling is what
&gt; &gt;I can expect with more KYB.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Oh, well, time to move cars and jack up cars and R&amp;R and R&amp;R and . ..
