Subject: Happiness is an elec. sound bilge blower...

 
--Electrical engineer's note:

Be sure to cross reference electrical ratings of all the equipment in use before powering up.

&gt;Visit NAPA - they have a ready made rotary switch (speed control) for 
&gt;heater blowers for about $12 I think.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Also, can someone give me some resistor guidance? I
&gt;&gt;want to put in a three position switch to give me
&gt;&gt;high, med and low on the blower without melting the
&gt;&gt;wiring. (The '70s wiped out my high school physics.)
