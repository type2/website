Subject: Re: [T2] hard to get clean in hard water..

Hey there-

If what you have is hard water deposits, not oxidation, just add vinegar to
your wash water. If you have oxidation, however, you will need to polish it
off as suggested by others on the list. I have had very good results with
teflon-based aircraft wax (try your local small airfield). It is a bit
spendy, though.
Cheers,

Matthew

&gt; I finally gave my bus a much needed wash tonight. No wonder she seems
slow,
&gt; she's got an extra 40 lbs. of hard water deposits on her!!
