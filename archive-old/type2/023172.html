Subject: Altimeter
Mime-Version: 1.0

OK Mountain Folks,

Who has successfully put an altimeter in their bus, and become pleased with 
what they bought?
If happy, what did you install?
Analog - Digital - Model ?

I'm looking to install one in Casper so I can see how high we go as we go 
higher. :-)

Does not need to have a low level scale for Houston peaks known as overpasses.
