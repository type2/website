Not likely with a normal Z-bed, maybe you could find a folding rear seat and
do it that way.

&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt;
&gt; You guys are awesome!  I've posted two questions in the last two days and
&gt; both times I received 6+ responses in the first half hour followed by a
&gt; handful more throughout the day.  I really appreciate everyone's help and
&gt; hopefully I'll be able to help out someone else one of these days.
&gt;
&gt; Now to my question.  My 73 is a non-camping transporter with both standard
&gt; seats installed.  I want to replace the rear seat with a camping fold-down
&gt; bed/seat (preferrably a full-width bed/seat), but I don't want to have to
&gt; remove my middle seat.  That may sound strange, but that's what I want to
&gt; do.  My question is: Will the rear seat be able to unfold into a bed with
&gt; the middle seat in place or is there not enough space for the bed to work
&gt; with the middle seat?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Brian
