Why don't you get one of the original style rev limiters?  they go under the 
carb on the manifold.  Haven't ever installed one myself, But I have seen it 
in action- stopped upping the revs at about 3500.  It is adjustable- so you 
can set the cut off where you like.  See them at swaps cheap.  Bet its in 
your Bentley manual.


&lt;&lt; dont these only start to work at like 5500 rpm's or something?  you would
 have to be deaf not to know that you should let your foot off the pedal at
 that point, that is if your poor engine doesnt go first.  as far as i know
 they are for porsches and drag racers.  let me know if you find them with a
 lower cut off, say 3400 or something.  id be interested in those.
