	I have ordered several items from the Depot , including a stock '71
exhaust system and have always found them to be very reliable and fast.  I
have used other parts suppliers who have shipped incorrect parts.

	I believe one should seriously consider the effect of posting such a
message on a list of 1000 subscribers could have on a small specialized
business such as The Bus Depot.  It is not a Fortune 500 company such as
Rocky Mountain.

	Finally, I always see helpful posts from Ron Salmon on all kinds of topics
and questions.

	Although this list should not infringe upon someone's first amendment
rights,  I believe there should be some policy concerning the use of the
list to post negative comments which surely have a far reaching effect on
someone's livelihood.
