Subject: [T2] Strange Idle
Content-Disposition: inline

&gt;Starts cold and idles perfectly for 45 seconds ?, then dies. Will restart
&gt;fine but then not idle for 2 or 3 minutes until warm, then all is good
&gt;again.
&gt;What am I missing??????? Has anyone had this symptom???

Sounds like something subtly sticking or ....? Perhaps check the integrity of
the wire
connections where they enter the double relay and/or series resistor block, and
where they leave the in-line fuel pump. How about the MPC to the thermo time
switch
under the intake air distributor? It's tough to reach but if the little bale
wire
is off due to cracked plastic, it might not be making a solid connection and
will
cause rough starting - not your exact problem, but..... after that,perhaps try
starting it with the cold start mpc off - maybe it's flooding it by not shutting
off after cold start.
