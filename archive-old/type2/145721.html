Subject: Re: [T2] best source for turnkey type4

Thanks for everyone's responses...especially Karl's
characteristically thorough and fog-clearing one.

Looks like i was able to talk the kid down off the
turnkey ledge and let me just put heads on it.

Anyone have any experience with these $189 reman heads
on busdepot?

Ron - any of these come back to you yet?

Looks like a hell of a deal if they're holding up!

tia,
clark

&gt; I do not  know of anyone offering a turnkey type 4

&gt; many  differences from year to year
&gt; to even attempt  this.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; hey Karl  I will do this only one way.  The customer
&gt; brings me  his bus and I 
&gt; do the motor job and he comes and gets it and turns
&gt; the key and  goes home. 
&gt; :) I will not sell just the motor for the reasons
&gt; you gave.  Later  Mark
