&lt;&lt; Well, when I inherited my '78 Westy, I immediately went to the local VW 
 dealer (Houston) to get some replacement parts and was nearly laughed out of 
 there.  Not only did they not have any in stock, they were completely 
 uninterested in even trying to help me get any parts.
 
 Maybe just my local dealership, maybe not.
  &gt;&gt;
I once had to drag an old service guy over to the parts counter to convince 
the &quot;parts man&quot; that VW built a pickup before the Caddy (rabbit truck). 
The dealership has been most helpful in obtaining parts for my various air 
coolers over the years-- NOT!
In fact, they seem to want to make you feel like an idiot for still having 
them.
