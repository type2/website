Subject: Re: [T2] Roll Back Odometer , replacing engine....

That leads me to a question, my odometer hasn't worked in years, 
sitting happily at 885657, I keep track of where I drive her and do 
oil/filter changes and tune ups FAR too often, she runs like a dream. 
HOWEVER I am thinking more and more that I would actually like a 
working Odometer so I may delve into the console and see what's shaking 
in there ... my Speedo works fine so that is attached maybe a gear is 
loose in there, I have the VDO speedo/odometer. Any thoughts ?


&gt; Of course, having a working odometer is also a great way to measure 
&gt; mileage...
