Subject: Carb rebuild

Go easy on me, it's my first time.

We're talking 32-34 PDSIT here. I've got my right Solex taken apart as far
as I can get it.

The problem I'm having with the top half is one rounded-out screw on the
butterfly valve -- I'm assuming I have to get that off before I can take
off the bit that the rod's holding on?

The bottom half is all taken apart, except the throttle flap won't come off
because I can't get the rod out. I took one end off and a cylindrical bit
of brass came out -- the dreaded throttle body bushing? -- but a little bit
of banging couldn't convince it to pop through. Also, when I shake the
bottom half there's something tinging around inside it -- what's that, and
is it supposed to be there? I can't find anything else to detach from the
unit to access any hidden cavities that could contain whatever's producing
this sound.

Help!

Nikki
