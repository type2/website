Subject: Re: [T2] Zinc - is it good ?

I can vouch for this one. I have a garden tiller that I used the Loctite 
rust converter on and never painted it. It is left outside all the time no 
shelter. Still holding.

&gt;From: Richard Atwell Loctite and many others make rust inhibiting sprays. 
&gt;Use that.
