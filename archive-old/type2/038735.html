&gt; Hi All
&gt; 
&gt; I'm a recent owner of a '71 Westy.
&gt; 
&gt; One of the &quot;missings&quot; on my bus are the control knobs for the heater/vent
&gt; system, and the labels on what lever does what.
&gt; Would one of you folks ping me what lever does what so I can at least put a
&gt; dymo label on them for the short term?

Don't worry about labels, there never were any.

The left two knobs, which are red in color, are connected to the left and
right heater box flapper valves.  Pull them down for heat.

The right two knobs are connected to the left and right air vents.  Pull
one or both down for fresh air.

Other heat controls:

On the vertical tube under the dashboard there is a lever that controls
the flow of air to the driver's feet or the defroster.  Lever down is
defrost, lever up directs heat to feet.

On the front side of the driver's seat pedistal, there is a pull knob.
Pulling this knob out directs heat to the middle seat through vents at the
aft end of the pedistal.

Under the rear seat are two levers next to the heat vents.  Pushing the
levers outboard opens the vents.  Inboard closes them.  I'm not sure if
the Westy has these vents or not.

Replacement levers, with knobs, can be found at wreckers.
