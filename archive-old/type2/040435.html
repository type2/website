i have what i belived to have been a 74' campmobile. i looked up the VIN
# off the dash, and compared it to #s found at
http://www.type2_dot_com/bartnik/tech.htm. according to that it is a 75'.
well that is cool.  i looked up the # engraved on the fan housing above
the fan fitted to the crankshaft. it was ED018057. the ED after i looked
it up means it is a 2000 engine. this is fine but i was wondering if fan
housing from an 1800 or other engine are interchangable. because if so
the fan hosing could of been off a 2000 engine and the engine it was put
on (mine) might really be an 1800 engine. suggestions comments??
