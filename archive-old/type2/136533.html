POR-15 is great, but it cannot be used where exposed
to the sun.  But be careful:  Read the instructions. 
It is not at all a normal paint.  The makers of POR-15
have other really great products as well.  Especially
an A &amp; B body putty that hardens like iron.  Like
Play-doh on steroids.

&gt; I got a catalog from the POR-15 people.

&gt; It's really cool.   My friend how has a Type III
&gt; used it on his and it
&gt; worked wonders.
