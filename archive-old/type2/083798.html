Subject: RE: Tee fitting.

&gt;I'm getting ready to install a 2L fuel injected engine into 
&gt;my 74' bus. I know the fuel tank has to have an return line 
&gt;but I heard of putting a Tee fitting to the outlet. Will this 
&gt;work? Has anybody done this? I have the fuel tank for a fuel 
&gt;injected set-up, but if I a tee fitting will work I'd rather 
&gt;not swap tanks.

Swap the tanks.  You'll be a lot happier knowing you set this up right.  This 
question has come up a couple times before and I always make this same 
observation:  With the return going into the tank (where it's supposed to go) 
you are using your tank to cool the gas that is coming back from your VERY hot 
engine compartment.  With the T-fitting, you are recirculating the already-hot 
gas and making it hotter.  Live in Alaska?  Maybe not a problem.  Drive in 90+ 
degree weather?  Plan on vapor lock.
