Not a whole lot of busses back east. Did they all rust out, or are they garaged 
for
the winter? I took a 6 day trip to Boston (Framingham) to see my sister-in-law, 
and
to attend a wedding in Connecticut. Only saw 5 busses the whole time. We were
cruising down the road in Sudbury Mass., when I saw a 21 window bus down a 
side road, it looked like it had a for sale sign on the rear side window. I had 
the
sister-in-law bang a quick U-turn and we checked it out. Nice blue-green spit
with sunroof and 21 windows. It turned out that the &quot;for sale&quot; sign was just a
conglomeration of stickers on the window, and the bus had California plates.
