Subject: Pulled engine, stuff and advice needed.

Well I pulled my motor today ('69 bus).  
Did it myself.  
Got all the stuff off, nice little masking tape
labels, parts in a place that won't be disturbed..
Cleaned the tin.  Hey.  Is it really tin?  It looks 
and feels like steel to me.  
So the old singleport longblock is ready to sell.
Now I can start putting it on the new motor!

Only a few problems.  The first was that 
the upper mounting bolt on the left, was nonexistant. 
Like somebody was too lazy to put it back there.

Also, no &quot;Hoover bit&quot;.
I've never seen one, but I think I don't have it.
Is it pictured in Bentley?  

The second problem is there is thermostat, or anything 
that would have connected to it.  Guess I'll spend about a
day reading what the archive has to say about &quot;Thermostat&quot;.
And probably a year finding all the parts.  The whole time
fending off FLAPS people who tell me &quot;you don't need it.&quot;

Third problem, which really bites my wax tadpole*, is that
the MUFFLER is (was) WELDED to the HEAT EXCHANGERS.
Perfectly good heaters.  I uttered many swear words today
as I hacksawed the muffler off.  I don't know if they can
be salvaged.  I wonder what I'll have to pay for decent used 
heater boxes?  I was careful to cut close to the muffler.  
The muffler was trash to begin with.  So, just any type-1 
J-Tubes until I can afford new heaters?  Maybe I can grind 
the welded stuff off.  I welcome any ideas.  I reckon J-tubes
will get me from texas to arizona and back.  And I probably 
won't need the thermostat in the summer.

I'm a little nervous about the fact that my motor didn't come
with a distributor drive gear.  I have a drive gear and the
two little washers... But I read in the sermons that the
thing needs to be put in a certain way.  Can somebody please
elaborate?   And why in the hell do these things come without
one installed?
