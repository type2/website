Subject: Curtain rods/pattern

Bus Drivers,

Anyone know where I can order a full set of curtain rods for a 73 bay
window? It's not a camper......but it does have some big white 'button
lookin' things near the windows that may or may not be for curtain
mounting. I checked busdepot and busted bus....but nothing jumped out
at me. Will these (http://www.type2_dot_com/library/camper/sliders.htm) do
the trick?

Also....does anyone have a pattern for making curtains for these rods?
I wanted to at LEAST do that part myself and wondered if anyone
already had something cobbled together.

Thanks very much,
Scott
