I just (last weekend) installed a three window canvas I ordered from Bus 
Depot on my 87 Westy.  Installation was close to the way a 71 goes on except 
the top is screwed on the later westies instead of stapled.  I wasn't the 
worst job I've every attempted but it was time consuming.  Follow the 
directions, leave yourself about 5-6 hours and go for it.  Mine turned out 
great and I love the extra windows...
