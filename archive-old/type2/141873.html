&gt; Yes, the bus list is the most helpful one I've come across.  Most lists
&gt; for more modern cars tend to be occupied by folks who don't know which end
&gt; of the soldering iron to hold and with no interest in learning.  All they
&gt; want to know is things like &quot;will these kewl wheels look good on my rice
&gt; rocket?&quot;
&gt;

&gt;     I'm on a couple of other lists and it's (my take on it...) a combin-
ation of economics and status...The LBC's (Little British Cars), that
were cheap affordable sportscars of the 50's and 60's have become
collectable and moderate to expensive icons...The attitudes range
from a few owners who resemble this list (keep 'em on the road at
a minimum of cost and a maximum of ingenuity and elbow grease)
to the &quot;where can my upholsterer obtain original thread to restore
my boot lining&quot;...

Anecdotal evidence:
I got some &quot;found money&quot; and decided to spurge on a car that I
wouldn't have under ordinary circumstances...It was still a &quot;bas-
ket case&quot; but at least all there and a starting point for a rebuild
(I won't even consider using the word, restoration). I was already
on that car's particular list, since I was looking for one, and after
I got my pile of fine British junk home, I started to query the list
about sources for parts, prices, etc...The responses were usually
the same...A list of specialist shoppes, boutiques, etc. that ca-
tered to the particular mark, oops, marque, at boutique prices...
What really galled me were the couple, three emails I got that
hinted, well, actually said, that if I couldn't afford these &quot;best&quot;
sources, wouldn't it be better if I sold off my pile of parts to
someone who could do it &quot;properly&quot; with the &quot;correct&quot; parts
and financial outlay... ;-(
