i would suggest you replace the fram filter with a bosch. frams tend to
burst. i don't know if thats what is causing your problem though.

I've had better luck with FRAM than with BOSCH.  I always tighten 3/4 to 
one full turn after initial contact with mating surface.  A better 
choice, IMHO, are WIX filters, if you can find them.

As for the hiccup, see if your fuel filter is clogged, then see if gas 
flows freely from the tank.  The screen in the tank may be stopped up 
with debris.  If so, jamming something like a cutoff coathanger into the 
little pipe that comes from the tank should clear the debris.  Try not 
to get soaked with gasoline in the process (feels bad).

I've had excellent results with Techron fuel injector cleaner, made by 
Chevron.
