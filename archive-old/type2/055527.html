&gt; Not too bad, but it does leak.  It leaked here when I got the bus, and

Yes, I've had this problem too. It still leaked (in small volume and only
sporadically) even after I rebuilt the engine and replaced all seals.

I came to suspect it was coming from the stock oil pressure light sender,
located directly above the oil filter point of attachment, so I replaced
that too. Only cost a couple of bucks. It didn't seem to do the trick though.
It's not the oil cooler, nor is it points of attachment of the oil cooler.

I also seem to leak (in small volume) from the base of the dipstick tube,
despite a new rubber seal there. I tried putting a little hose clamp around that
seal to make it tighter, but the leak persists. This one tends to accumulate
on the tips of the two bolts on the bottom of the rear engine mount. 
I've replaced that seal repeatedly without lasting effect.

I thought I'd use liberal amounts of gasket sealer on oily connections, but
some on this list have discouraged me from this because they say bits of
sealer could come off on the inside, travel with the oil stream, lodge in some
tiny but important oil passageway, starve a bearing for oil, wear it out, and 
force a tragically premature rebuild upon me. Yikes! I'd rather deal with the 
drip, I guess.

I have worked hard to stop ANY AND ALL oil leaks because more oil leaks from
America's collective autos than is spilled by tankers and it all ends up in the
creeks and oceans. I don't want to be part of the problem. But the intractable 
and persistent  nature of these leaks has led me to adopt an almost 
superstitious attitude: my bus seems to possess a tiny gremlin whose sole 
purpose in life is to facilitate the escape of small amounts of motor oil from 
my engine. I would need to make it my ongoing fulltime job to stop him/her/it
and I've got bigger fish to fry.

But I try, part-time. What would I be if I didn't try? You've got to try.

Good luck,
