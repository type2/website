Subject: RE: Push rod tube seals.

Two Type4 push rod tube tips.  First, clean them real well with a solvent
(while they're in) and let them dry.  Because the hard part is getting
a good barehanded grip on them to pop them out.  Any tool but your hand
will dent or distort them.

Second, lube the new seals with silicon lube (NOT silicon sealant).  Each
seal wants to be popped in, but not glued in, to its detent.

Good luck!
