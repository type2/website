Subject: Gas Heaters

Up here in Canada the BA6s can be found on both water and air-cooled
Vanagons as well as the later Buses. I have gas heater manuals courtesy of
Jack Reed; basically they are the Bentley manuals plus various German pieces
on BN4s. I'd recommend that Jack Reed's 1995 archived piece on heater
installations be scanned first. It is reasonably detailed.

I am still looking for the wire connectors and harness for  the relays if
anyone has them. Still no luck getting the thing to run.


PS. Recently I have been using 15W50 synthetic  (without the second cooler)
and since the post-GEX head rebuild,  the lifters have been extraordinarily
noisy and getting noisy.  The mechanic put some &quot;heavy duty&quot; (the stuff used
in worn engines-probably 50W) oil in the engine and it has never run
quieter. A quick and easy fix and much cheaper than the 40.00 per for the
lifters.
