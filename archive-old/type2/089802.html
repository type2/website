Subject: Carburetor question

I have a '74 1800 engine that I am installing with the dual solex 34pict 
carbs.  This setup has an electromagnetic cutoff on the central idle system 
and a smaller cutoff valve next to it on the left carb.  The right carb does 
not have a cutoff valve but I suspect that it is supposed to.  The spot where 
it should be has what looks like a carb jet installed.  Am I correct in 
thinking that this is some p.o.'s jury rigging?
