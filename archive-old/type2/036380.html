Okay guys, I would think it would be REALLY obvious that this is not an
appropriate topic for this list, and George already asked that this thread
be killed.  Since that apparently didn't work, let me reiterate the
following:

The charter states that posting on a topic after an admin has asked that it
be killed is cause for permanent removal from this list.  Yes, even for you.

Take it to e-mail, or rec.autos.vw, or the bus-life list, but no more posts
about gas prices to type2, effective yesterday.  Okay?
