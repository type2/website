Subject: RE: [T2] Just got my Bus Depot exhaust nuts...

Hey there Don nice to see you got some nuts =D! Kind of like SNL skit about 
(Holiday Shwetty Balls).

&gt;Wow. I was picturing crappy steel nuts with the plastic insert. I
&gt;wasn't expecting copper crush nuts.

&gt;I'd say these are well worth the $25 for 100pieces, though I think BD
&gt;should sell 'em for $8 for 20 so we don't have to buy 100 of 'em. Not
&gt;that I mind having extras, however... heh

&gt;(Please, no offers to buy my extras. All that I'm willing to part with
&gt;are already spoken for.)

&gt;Now I'm off to replace the alternator in my Fiero, then start dropping
&gt;the exhaust on the bus, again.
