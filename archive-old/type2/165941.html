Subject: Re: [T2] engine oil additive problems coming? ?

On the way to work I went shopping.

I stopped at FLAPS, and found Castrol of any variety on the shelves-En
Mass with the SF API labelling on it only.

I stopped at my buddies Yamaha dealer.
I checked out all of the oils on the shelf.
The Golden Spectro 15/40 &amp; 50 synthetic has an MA &amp; a SL rating.

So did the Suzuki oil, and Yamaha 4 stroke oils.
The motorcycle market is going to be immune from the green people.
Only a couple of bikes have converter's installed on them anyway--Honda
Goldwing is one. 

So any bike shop would be a good place to buy oil in small quantities.

I called Farm &amp; Fleet and asked what the Mystic JT-8 oil had on the
labels---
All of the drum's 5 gallon pails, &amp; the cases had SL API labels on them.

I called Cenpeco oil company &amp; Shaeffer Oil company in Central ILL.
They both made are Pennsylvania paraffin based crude stock, and both are
still have the API SL rating.

Then I got to work and looked at the 55 gallon drums of Citco 15/40 , 30
weight, &amp; 40 weight drums.

They had both the early diesel &amp; the later specs on them, as well as the
API SL &amp; SM rating.
I'm not sure how the oil could have both specs.

It must be a left coast green thing primarily, simply because there is
too much of the SL rated stuff still here in the Midwest. 

I bought 2 drums of Mystic JT-8 from Farm &amp; Fleet for myself.
This should keep me going for several years.

Most of all of this is a scare tactic---
I don't think the oil companies and the EPA are prepared for the
repercussions of low quality lubricating oils--yet.


Adios,
