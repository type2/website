&gt; had Bosch F.I. licensed systems. Others of Datsun/Nissans had them. Not at
&gt; all dissimilar from the VW T-I &amp; II F.I. systems of the same and later era.
&gt; These Air Flow Meter systems work well and last long.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Like it!  I'm concerned about being able to work on it, though.  Can my mind
&gt; &gt;grok both Datsuns and VWs at the same time?  A good question.

Well, there _is_ an idiot book (published by Muir, illustrated by Peter
Aschwanden) for the '68-86 RWD Datsun/Nissans!  Good book, but about twice
as thick as the VW book.

&gt; Again, do yourself a favor and stay within the family, unless by your
&gt; inquisative nature you enjoy solving new problems by putting time in new
&gt; knowledge of new viewpoint.

Having owned both, the 68-72 Datsuns were about as easy to fix as VWs.
Parts availability is not as good, though.  Nissan is very good about
supplying spares (even racing parts!) but the prices are pretty stiff.

&gt; Did later 510's use the same engine as the 240 series, et al, or were they
&gt; only 4cyl. I say, stay within the VW family for best overall value. 

No, the late 510s used Z-series 4-cylinder engine.  Early 240Zs used
L-series straight 6 engines.

Early (68-73) 510s were much better cars than the late ('78-on) 510s (the
two series are completely different) The early cars had true IRS and
handled like BMWs, the late 510 had a wagon-axle in the rear and handled
like, umm..., wagons.  SCCA rally drivers still use early 510s in amateur
classes.

I sold my 510 a couple of years after I bought my bus.  I have fond
feelings for both, but the bus suited my needs better.

Our perfect second car is a '69 beetle.  Having complete engine
commonality with our bus is a great thing!
