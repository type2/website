Subject: Re: Stranded Man on Van Dorn Street

Harmon, thanks for our post.

You are, of course, right on!!  And I would have passed by David on the
street if it were not for his broken bus.

David does not want/seek or need help.  None the less, I felt that I
must OFFER help re: his VW problems.   

Not clothes, food, work, warmth...  he can handle all this.  

And as I found out yesterday, he can handle the VW problems, too.  This
is similar to seing a fellow VW type 2 broken on the road, stopping by,
and being told &quot;Thanks, but I have a handle on the problem.&quot; and then
driving off with a clear conscience  (I did blow by a stranded bus one
summer day, and I regret my selfish actions even now.)

I responded (off list) to all the offers of help which I received.  But
I would like to include my final posting to you and CC: the list so that
I can close this picture, and get on with my Xmas shoping.  The slightly
edited post follows:

Paul, thank you for your concerns about Davis.

I only met David two days ago.  He is indeed a 'homeless' person,
probably the most certifiable example.

He will get on just fine, through this cold spell.  He has a propane
heater (I mentioned this earlier as a kerosene heater.  I was mistaken.)
and access to propane gas just about 1/2 mile walk (on the outer side of
the beltway.)

He is not penniless, since he has a source of income from SSI.  And, of
course, he does not rely on anyone, since he MUST remain independent and
self reliant.

Curious, I stopped by his bus at lunch (with my '78 Westy) and offered
him some Jerry's white pizza and a beer or Coke.  He politely declined. 
I had him sit in a lawn chair inside of the Westy, and he felt
comfortable with that. His basic clothes outfit being  -understatement
follows- dirty.

I told him that I would swing by after 3 PM (yesterday) and take him to
a junk yard to check out an engine that had a carb setup.  Well, David
was well prepared with what must have been his Sunday-go-to-meeting
clothes. 

His sneakers were unworn and like new, along with this blue jeans.  He
was going to a junk yard in his finest outfit because he knew how clean
my Westy was.

He was so clean that I had him sit up front!!

Anyway, after the excursion at Penny's, he decided to go for the 1.8L
long block at Falls Church.

He may need some help getting it delivered to his bus, but David sees no
difficulty in getting the engine into his bus.  He will just work
outside until his fingers get too cold, then go into the bus to warm
up.  He feels it will take one or two days.   

David has my card, and I hope he will call me if he needs help.

I used up all my 'comp time' yesterday, and I have to put in a full day
today, past 5 PM.  It will be too dark to stop by his bus after work, so
I guess I will go by at lunch to remind him that my offer of
transporting the long block from Falls Church to Vine &amp; South Van Dorn
still stands.

Required Bus Content:  (hard habit to break!!)  David has removed and
rigged his 12V electric 'hot air' blower engine to power a grinder of
sorts, and to run a drill.  The grinder works fine, but he is only able
to drill wood with his fabricated blower/grinder/drill setup.  Perhaps
he needs better drill bits!!!

Bottom line is that David is going after the 1.8L long block from Ted
Dinkelacker in Falls Church.  He is walkable distance from and has been
to Olympic Auto Parts on Eisenhower Ave, and can get to propane and
food.

PS:  When I stopped by yesterday at lunch, there was a COOL WHIP
container outside his bus, at the left rear tire.  It had a press on red
bow attached to the top.  After David came into my Westy, I told him
about this container.  He thought it may have been something that just
blew by.  He went out, retrieved it, and opened it. It was a Cool Whip
container that was filled with an assortment of cookies and small
individually wrapped candies.  With a red bow attached to the lid. No
card.
