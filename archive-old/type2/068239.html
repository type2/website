Subject: Battery Q's

Well, I'm doing all the things a good doobie should be doing
while the engine is out.  I pulled the battery to get at the 
corrosion on the positive cable. While I had everything out 
on that side, I saw that the patch job the PO did is beginning
to corrode thru.  I'm gonna clean out as much loose crap as I can.
This got the ol' brain churning again......

What's the proper battery for this beast, anyway?? It's had a 
series 24 for as long as I've had it.  This brings up....

How is the battery supposed to be tied down?? Mine's been bouncing
around loose for 7 years. I see what looks to be a spot for a threaded
rod? on the inboard side of the battery spot, and a lip on the outboard
side. Will a basic aftermarket L-rod setup work here?

Just looking for some input here...I KNOW the proper way of handling
this is to have the old floor cut out and a new one welded in, but that's
not going to happen right now.  I'm looking for ways to inhibit the 
corrosion and to secure the battery.

Thanks for the support so far -- I was told by a fellow listmember that
I need to get the engine back in and get on with my life (ok, not a 
direct quote)....I just spent about half an hour meditating in the spot
the engine belongs......

Cheers--
'71 Campmobile
