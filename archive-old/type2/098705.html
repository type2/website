Subject: Re: [T2] Home made Poptop canvas

AS was mentioned, I sewed my poptop canvas from a small tent that's   
poles were long gone. The trick is to carefully take out your old     
canvas, and use a seamripper to cut the seams apart. You can then lay 
the original panels on top of your tent to get the best layout...trace
the panels onto the new tent, cut, and sew...there are several        
pictures of my set-up on my bus page, off                             
www.teamspatula_dot_com                                                   
pretty easy project alltogether, and you get way bigger windows.      
                                                                      
&gt; Anyone out there ever try to make your own poptop canvas for a 68-73
Westy?  I                                                             
&gt; have a bunch of old Eureka Timberline Tents in my garage (one perk  
of running                                                            
&gt; Summer Camps for the past 7 years) and a sewing machine.  These are 
quality                                                               
&gt; nylon tents, well they were, they have miscellaneous holes and      
broken zippers                                                        
&gt; now. But my concern is the size of the fabric panels needed for the 
poptop                                                                
&gt; canvas. Does anyone one know approximately how big the LARGEST panel
of the                                                                
&gt; poptop would need to be?                                            
&gt; I don't want to rip out my old canvas only to find that the tents   
are not big                                                           
&gt; enough to sew a replacement.
