&gt; Is there a carb option for the 1700 besides the stock carbs, which I heard
&gt; were very hard to keep in tune.  What about performance issues?

chase through the junk yards for a 71 or 72   411 and take the fuel
injection out of it, this works fine in the 1700 bus engine, make sure you
get ALL the parts as there are some slight differences in angles and bolt
patterns etc. (take the 411 heater while your there, they work great too)

but I have done this on my spare engine and it works great
