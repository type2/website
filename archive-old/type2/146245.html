Subject: Hole in Manifold Boot on '71 Type II

It's been years since the last time I suffered an intake leak because of a rip
in the silicone sleeve on my manifold fittings and I'm wondering if 21st
Century Science and Technology have advanced to the point where it is no
longer necessary to pull the engine to fix the darned thing, at least on a
temporary basis.  If I had just one other good reason (like an oil cooler leak
or a slipping clutch) to yank it I might do it but everything else is running
fine right now.  I've got an old pair of J.C. Whitney emergency repair boots
(the big fat split sleeve that presses together for a seal) I can use but they
never work as well as the real deal.  A check of the Archives suggests that
pulling the engine was thought to be the only practical way to address this
situation.

Any ideas?  I was thinking to strip off the old boot, apply a few layers of
that sticky tape made of metal foil to where the outside pipe ends for a
better seal, then use the emergency repair boots to hold everything in place
until some future point in time.  Has any aftermarket company come up with a
better gizmo than the Whitney version?


Thanks,

Nick
