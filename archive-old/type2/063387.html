Subject: OKTOBERBUS,  NC BUS EVENT Oct. 11,12 

This is a copy Brad Stiller gave to me of the event he is planning   
Oct,11,12, near Statesville NC.

Hello,
     To my knowledge there are no scheduled events for VW busses in   
Piedmont North Carolina.  Since there is an IVWA drag race and swap meet   
in Farmington Drag Strip the same weekend, it might be a good time to try   
a campout.  Oktoberbus is only about 30 minutes away from Farmington.
 Activities for Oktoberbus will be tentative depending on time busses   
show up, as well as overall turnout.  Saturday will be more a time for us   
to get together and be as a group and camp out.  A caravan is planned to   
Farmington Sunday where there will be a swap meet.
 Oktoberbus is open to all Bus Enthusiasts as including Limbo and Neato   
members.  If you have a bus DRIVE IT!!
 Please register with Brad Stiller when you arrive.

for more info call:  Brad Stiller    704-637-1405
    

Van Hoy Farms Family Campground,  just 4/10 mile off of interstate 77,   
exit 65 just north of Statesville NC  704 539-4934



 I plan on attending the event so I hope all of you can come.  The   
Hanging Dog event was really great and my 74 westie did great in the   
mountains.  And no more gas leaks!!!   I'll write more about Hanging dog   
later, now I have to go to Boston on Business.   Erick
