My bus started doing something kind of similar.  The red light (can't remember
if it was the alternator or oil pressure light or both) would glow softly when
the head lights were on.  When I turned on the turn signal, they would flash in
an opposite rhythm to the flasher lights.  I eventually found out that the
dimmer switch, which is part of the turn signal mechanism, was old and crumbling
into pieces.  Man, electricity does weird things when it's shorting or not
grounding properly.  I wired the dimmer switch to a different switch from my
FLAPS until I can find the proper replacement.  Problem solved.  You might also
take a look at the wires on the back of the headlight switch.  They may be
loose, or the switch may have rotated and pulled a wire off.

When the bus is running the light can barely be seen, turn signals on and it
starts to flash a little bit brighter glow, then headlights on and it becomes a
constant very soft glow, but evident.  What gives I've replaced everything and
there are no new changes in the electric department to explain this.
