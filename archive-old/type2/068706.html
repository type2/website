&gt;       Being this my first bus, I am being introduced to a whole new driving
experience. Is there 
&gt;anything I can do to tighten up the front end? I am used to rack and pinion
steering. I am getting 
&gt;used to the handling. I just had to see if there was something out there to
ad a little stability.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance for any responses,

James,

Two things come to mind.  Wheel bearing adjustment is the first to
check.  Then check the &quot;swing arm lever&quot; (center of top of lower
torsion bar).  Muir has an excellent rap on both.  If it ain't
those two things, that leaves you with ball joint probs.

Pray it's the wheel bearings :o)

p.s. Oh, yes. One more thing to check is the dampening shock.
