My friend Connie is selling her 1971 VW Cargo Van (no windows). It's
 only had two owners, fully documented. Absolutely original. 105,000
 miles total. Motor rebuilt a while back. Professionally maintained. I've
 ridden in it and it runs great. Very, very clean. She's asking $4500.00.
 Located in Laguna Beach, CA. Please email Connie direct at:

 Thanks
