Subject: question about compufire/pertronix

Hey Everyone,
I'm trying to understand a few things about how coils and points 
replacements work as I am going to be setting up ignition control with 
my megasquirt.

So, I understand that with points, when they are closed, the negative 
terminal of the coil is grounded and the coil charges.  When the points 
open, the negative terminal is no longer grounded and the coil fires; 
that part is easy.

Now, what I am trying to figure out is how the points replacement units 
work.  I am guessing that they are not passive devices since they 
require +12v to operate.  The part I don't get is where they get the 
ground to complete the circuit that powers the unit, which would also be 
the same ground used to ground the the negative side of the coil.  Do 
they use the distributor as a ground?  I never really looked at my unit 
when I installed it so I'm curious if it's grounding through the 
installation screw...

Anyone have any ideas?

Thanks!
Mike
