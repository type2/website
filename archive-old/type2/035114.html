Subject: My last word on reliability

Imagine getting on a commercial airliner. As you do so, you run into the 
pilot who beams, &quot;the airline picked up this 737 for just a half a 
million dollars, and we've been flying it for two years without doing a 
thing to it!&quot;

Are you going to take your seat? Or get the heck off the plane?
