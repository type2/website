Subject: Re: [T2] Heat in a Bus

i used aluminum duct tape to wrap the open areas.... works very well along side some of that nasa type insulation (silvery looking stuff).....
  i havent had any smells besides the smell from the heater boxes....
   
  also my heater boxes needed the connectors for the flexi pipes so i made new connectors out of dr pepper cans..(cut the ends out of each can and used the aluminum duct tape once again to strap to cans and wallahhhh i have heat...
  i know its jerry but when fuinds are low and its brrrrrrrrrrrr cold i had to do something......
   
  works for me....for now... 
   
  still looking to get rid of the cans though whenever i find the heater box connectors...
   
  good luck with whatever you do... i have seen all sorts of contramptions to get heat.....
   
  peace

  Hi,
there is a product I sed to insulate all my exhaust pipes, etc. Its 
fiberglass non-adhesive tape. Midwest Motorworks sells it. It stinks for 
a few thousand miles as the stuff smells a bit like waffles burning 
until the stuff finishes aging. Works great. You will need something to 
clamp it in place though. They sell ties that I didn't much like. I 
ended up using baling wire and hose clamps as they worked better and 
were snugger (more snug).

&gt; Also the U pipes are exposed and I could perhaps wrap these with 
&gt; something but I do not know what as they get real hot. The up pipes to 
&gt; the flapper boxes could be wrapped in fiberglass and the flapper boxes 
&gt; as well. Does anyone have
&gt; suggestions on what to do with the plastic accordion &quot;Mufflers&quot; and Y 
&gt; connection?
