Subject: [T2] engines........

I got a new bus minus the engine. Well sort of...I got a '74 Westy with a
'66 1500cc (i think) motor which isn't installed. I already have a '75 bus
with the FI 1800cc... I love the FI too.... my question... how much should
i spend on a used late 70s engine...im looking for a 1800-2000 to put in
this new project.....I know bus depot has them new/rebuilt in the ballpark
of $1100( which rocks)
 
 and another question....
the previous owner said that he installed the 1500cc in the '74 and got it
to turn.... tranny is original... is this possible?Im not as framiliar
with the 1500cc as I am with the 1700+... either way the 1500
needs more work than i want to spend on a 1500.



thanks...
