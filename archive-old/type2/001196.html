I walked into the shop yesterday morning and nearly tripped over something
on the floor.  This in itself was far from unusual, since the floor is
littered with half-packed boxes and bus parts and generally looks like a
disaster area each day after the UPS driver leaves.  What was unusual was
that this particular obstacle was feathered.

We are located in a rural area of Pennsylvania.  There are farms all around,
and directly next to us, a genuine farmers market that is open only Monday
mornings and has a weekly livestock auction.  It is not unusual to see a
stray chicken wandering around after the sale.  You hear roosters crowing
all day long on many days.  I don't know who said that roosters only crow at
the break of day, but that person obviously never lived near a rooster.

Anyway, it turns out that when Dan and Jeremy came in yesterday morning, a
very small rooster (perhaps not fully grown, or maybe a dwarf breed of some
sort) followed them into the shop through the front door.  A friendly fowl,
he quickly decided he liked it at the Bus Depot and would stay a while.  He
was very tame, obviously used to people.  Mari was even holding him for a
while.  In fact, every time one of us put him back outside, he patiently
waited at the front door until someone opened it, then snuck back in.  He
was all over but surprisingly not really in the way most of the time.  There
was a certain absurdity, though, to taking a phone order and reaching for
the computer mouse to enter the order, only to find that you couldn't use
the mouse because there was a rooster standing on it.  And every once in a
while, he would run over to check a box someone was packing just in case
there happened to be food in there.  But for the most part he just sort of
wandered around like roosters do.

Late in the afternoon, when the outside heat had diminished again, he
wandered off.  I don't know if he'll be back.  I can't say I'd want to work
with him around every day (unless of course we could get him to help pack
boxes or answer phones; we could always use an extra hand - er, claw).  But
I have to admit I wouldn't be too upset if he wandered in once in a while.
As busy and crazy as it gets here, the comic relief of seeing a rooster
walking across the shop or suddenly jump onto a computer monitor you were
looking at eased the stress and made the day go by a whole lot faster.
