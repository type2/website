&gt;I wasn't able to get the distributor off my '79 Type II engine.

&gt;Sure, it's easy.  You may first have to change the position of the
&gt;distributor in order to remove the hold-down nut.  You do this by
&gt;locating the long 10mm nut toward the FRONT (front is front!) of the
&gt;distributor.  It sticks out to the right side of the distributor.  Put
&gt;your 10mm open end wrench on this and loosen it.  Now you can turn the
&gt;distributor body by hand to make room to get a wrench on the hold-down
&gt;nut.  Once you remove the hold-down nut, then the distributor simply
&gt;lifts off straight up.

An alternative method, not as neat as Sean's, but it saves having to
readjust your timing, is to gently tap a corner of the nut with a small
hammer via a screwdriver.  After I got mine off the first time, I filed some
neat little notches into the nut so I can tap it on and off quite easily.
BTW, if you lose the nut, don't ever start the engine with the dist just
sitting &quot;firmly&quot; in there.  Its a sure way to learn more about timing, dist
shaft washers etc.  And that's another story.  I learned the hard way ;-)

I hope I have posted this message correctly.  I haven't responded to the
list before.  Apologies if it goes somewhere it shouldn't!
