&gt; Hey All,
&gt; I had decided that since it is cold and rainy this week, that I would take the oportunity to adjust the rear torsion bars\spring plates on my 71 westy and correct a bit of my sagging rear end problem.  Now, I hate math! I hate angles! I hate measuring angles! And I hate trying to figure out how to add,subtract,figure angles! (Hey, I have a degree in Physical Education, what do you expect!) All I know is that my rear end is visibly a bit lower than my front.  So, I have been researching my Bentley, the type2 library, and an old Clymer manual I have. I am confident that I can do the procedures described, but then I thought &quot;WHY?&quot; The sag is noticable but it doesn't look bad.  So finally, here's my question:  What are the other reasons (besides appearance) to do this adjustment?? Does it affect handling? Is it going to be harmful to my bus' suspension if I DO NOT do this, and leave the rear to sag??? The appearance does not really bother me, but if there are other important reaso!
&gt; ns to do the adjustment, then I will. But if appearance is the only reason, the I will leave my bus' rear end to sag (it can match my own rear end!)TIA.

the normal stance for a bus is a bit high in front, since the driver will
make it sag a bit.  Check the level with a driver in the seat.

If you don't like calculating angles, simply level the bus before you
measure.
