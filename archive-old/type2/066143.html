Subject: Re: busses, environment, etc. - stats?

&gt;- --If you want to pollute less, those of you who are carbeurated can burn
&gt;alcohol (which becomes nothing but CO2 and H2O) with no modification but a
&gt;change of jets. This will run you $7-10 per gallon, which is expensive
&gt;compared to gasoline but very cheap compared to a new car. You might even
&gt;help to make the next oil war not worth fighting--a helluva lot of Beetles
&gt;in Brazil run on what is essentially 200 proof rum. I am &lt;that close&gt; to
&gt;doing this.

        Next question: Does the mileage change at all? If one can get
really good mileage and doesn't drive too much, would it be possible to
ferment some sugar or something and create your own alcohol? Joel-I
understand they do this back in the hills of your fair state, care to
comment?  ;-) The idea of a moonshine car is quite intriging, how about
some more details? Might be a way around the somg laws too.

Peace,
