Subject: Film, heat and cold in my '69 bus (really about heat exchangers)

My '69 nine-seater is getting to be a real movie-star. Last week I was asked
to supply a van for a TV-film that is being shot at the moment. This was the
second time this year. Some pictures of a TV production in which my van has
been used earlier can be found on
http://www.hrps_dot_demon.nl/jwbus/The_Clipper/Clipper.htm

The film is being shot on location about 10 miles north of Amsterdam, about
1.5 hrs drive from where I live.
So last Wednesday I set off in the direction of Amsterdam. I was supposed to
be there by 5 am as the scenes being shot were 'night-scenes'. It was cold
and raining. I got there in time just as the rain turned into hail.

The crew facilities were primitive, the organisation a chaos and I was told
they were running late. Eventually it was not before 9 am that they came
around to start filming the scenes with the bus in it. By this time the
temperature had dropped down to jabout freezing and a very cold wind was
blowing. Being outside putting the bus into the desired spot and rigging up
light inside made me cold to the bone. I was getting miserable and since it
also was not very warm in the crew quarters I was glad when it was all over
by 11. The whole thing had lasted about twice as long as expected. So I now
had to drive the 1.5 hrs back to home.

Fortunately I had replaced the heat exchangers by two new original VW heat
exchangers earlier this year. I put the two red levers on full and after
only a few minutes I was getting a pretty good output of warm air. After
about half an hour and with the outside temperature at about zero degrees (C
of course, 35 for you) it was getting too hot in the van!! I had to move the
levers to about halfway position to keep me from overheating. By the time I
got home I was warm and felt much better than before.

So, to all of you who don't live in SoCa or similarly warm places. Having
good heat in your bus starts with just rigging up the stock system to a
point where it works as it did when it left the factory. An auxiliary heater
is good to have of course, especially when you live in real cold places, but
the stock system will do quite well when properly maintained.

Happy bussin ....
