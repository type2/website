Subject: Re: [T2] splitting the main cooling duct

Had the same trouble with mine. Used a heat gun (industrial strength blow dryer)
around the dip stick tube and the locating dowels and it came apart easy. Careful
if you use a torch, you are working on aluminum. You will be amazed at the crud
you'll find inside after you get it apart.
Hope this helps you,
Tom

&gt; hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... it is seriously stuck right around that casting.  It
&gt; is split everywhere else and there are no screws.  When I try and stick
&gt; a screwdriver between the part where that casting is, it won't crack the
&gt; seal.  the dipstick part is kinda loose, so that's moving, but the other
&gt; area just won't budge...
&gt;
&gt; I'll do one more look-over to make sure there are no more screws, and
&gt; then I'll try and pry it apart.  I just don't want to crack it!
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,

&gt; &gt; Mike,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; IIRC, the sleeve doesn't come out, but the two duct halves separate at an
&gt; &gt; angle, i.e. approx. 45 degrees or the angle of the dipstick sleeve.  The
&gt; &gt; sleeve remains attached to one of the halves.  They don't simply come apart
&gt; &gt; but the you pull one half of the housing up and push the other down, sort
&gt; &gt; of...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The thing is one o'clock is an alignment casting, I'm pretty sure.  I didn't
&gt; &gt; have to do anything with it when I got mine apart, so that's probably not
&gt; &gt; the problem.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Good luck.  Once the thing comes apart, you'll see much more clearly what
&gt; &gt; I'm trying to describe.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Do I have to drive the oil dipstick sleeve out of the ducting before I
&gt; &gt; &gt; can split it?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, if you're looking at the hole where the cooling fan is (the big
&gt; &gt; &gt; hole in the middle of the ducting), just up to the right of the opening,
&gt; &gt; &gt; at about 1 o'clock, there is a little plug that looks like it's either a
&gt; &gt; &gt; screw that was sawed off or an alignment hole.  It's about an inch or so
&gt; &gt; &gt; from edge of the big circle opening.  Do other people have a screw
&gt; &gt; &gt; there?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; It seems like the dipstick sleeve and this wierd plug thing/broken screw
&gt; &gt; &gt; are the only things keeping me from splitting the duct.  I'd like to get
&gt; &gt; &gt; in there, clean it out, and put it back together.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; btw, it's a 78 2.0 fi
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; thanks,
&gt; &gt; &gt; MIke
