I had been having this problem every once in a while and it finally happened 
while I was at my mechanics shop. He heard me trying to start it up and said 
to floor the gas. I thought that was crazy but I did it and it started right 
up. He says when it is hot and hot outside some gas gurgles into the carb or 
something like that and floods the engine. Don't remember if he said it 
flushes it out or what but he said there is more air going into the engine 
at cranking speed then gas... still not sure of his explanation but it 
worked.

&gt;My '70 Bus has devoloped this annoying habit of not starting when the
&gt;engines warm. The starter turns it over as nicely, there's plenty of fire 
&gt;at
&gt;the spark plugs, and there's fuel to the carb. If you get out and push it
&gt;bump starts easy enough and it'll keep running until you shut it off again.
&gt;So far I've checked (not listed in order) the coil, condenser, fuel pump,
&gt;starter, checked for vapor lock and everything else I can think of short of
&gt;taking the carburator apart (because it was rebuilt 6 months ago and this
&gt;problem just started) all to no avail. My brains cramping up on this one 
&gt;any
&gt;ideas? Thanks
