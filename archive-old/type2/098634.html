Subject: Air Cooled Vanagon Auxillary Oil Cooler

I would really like to install an auxillary oil cooler. The 
one I want can be viewed at:

http://www.cbperformance_dot_com/catalog.asp?ProductID=231

However on its own its not much good, I know I need a 
thermostat operated bypass valve, and a sandwhich plate for 
the oil filter to hook this thing up. Anyone source these 
parts before? Anything else I need? Where do I get this stuff?

Thanks,
Chris

Hi Volks... I previously posted about the great effect the 
oil cooler I installed and had many responses requesting the 
source. I got it from CB Performance. 800-274-8337, 
www.cbperformance_dot_com. , part # 1717. Hope this helps... TBear
