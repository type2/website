Hi,
	Don't feel that this is a good topic of conversation for
this list.
 On a purely factual basis it's not correct to say that guns are
illegal in Oz. There was a tightening on the laws WRT automatic
weapons after the Port Arthur Massacre.
 Perhaps you getting confused with the UK, where &quot;handguns&quot; were
banned after the Dunblane Primary School shootings.

Cheers,
	 W.
