&gt; Hello Ray      How you doing , other than the
&gt; firing problem. 

Well, I'm doing ok, except that I gotta get this
thing ready for HCBF.  I would hate to miss it--
no pun intended.    

&gt; Did you use new 
&gt; plugs? 

yes, and I also switched the plugs that fired ok
in other cyl's to #4, no change.  

&gt;you have re-checked the valves, 

no but the valve cover's coming off tonight, I'm
suspicious of a cam problem because I think I've
ruled out anything electrical.  

&gt; firing order, 

several times

vacuum leaks, srayed 
&gt; carb cleaner into it to see if it fired. 

yeah.  Since I replaced the plug on #3, it has
fired ok.  I cannot think of any reason that a
carb issue would allow #3 to fire and cause #4 to
be dead.  

Thanks, Mark.  I hope to see you soon, brother.
