Howdy folks,      What is most likely going on when I have to let the
clutch out a bit in order to get my transmission to engage reverse?  Most
of the time my bus just goes into reverse no problem, but on occasion, I
have to let the clutch out slightly to engage my reverse.  Should I be
alarmed?  Is this the beginning of a particular sequence of coming events
that any of you are familiar with?  Planning a road trip pretty soon, so
I'd appreciate some advice or experiences with this one.........Thanx
