Yes, it is a fairly simple job.

1.  Remove valve cover, undo rocker bolts and remove the rocker gear with 
the bendy piece of wire.  Keep everything in order on a clean rag.

2.  Pull out the push rods (be careful to keep them in order).

3.  Pull the tubes out, twisting gently.  Grab them with a cloth rag 
exerting minimal pressure.

4.  Remove old rubber o-rings.

5.  Clean everything.  Very important.  Use solvent and thoroughly clean 
the areas where the o-rings sit in.  I recommend putting new push-rod 
tubes in but it is not essential.

6.  Put new o-rings on the pushrod tubes and gently re-insert until the 
satisfying &quot;click&quot; of them seating in place.

7.  Replace push-rods, little bendy wire to support them and then the 
rocker gear.  This part is a little tricky.  If you forget how the wire, 
etc. goes in, open the valve cover on the other side of the engine and 
have a peek.

8.  Tighten bolts to 15 lb/ft and readjust valve clearances (cold engine).

You might find these instructions on various VW archives, but the 
procedure is basically the same.  Good luck.

Adrian.
