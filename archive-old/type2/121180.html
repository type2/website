Subject: Engine Build

Greetings,

I am thinking about a engine build for my 71.  I don't want to hear
about type 4 options because that is out of my budget.  I need feed back
please.

1914cc
40 Kadron
remote oil cooler with fan
Bugpack header, single qp muffler
009 dizzy

I have owned and driven type one motors for 15 years and know how to
keep an eye on them it that makes sense.  But this is the first bigger
motor I want to build for a bus.  I am looking for something  with more
power, decent gas mileage, and ok reliability.  I already have a 40
Weber IDF single carb if you think that is better.

Will the 40 Kadrons work with this motor?  Will they work with a 2110?
How about a 2332?

Thank you,

Douglas
