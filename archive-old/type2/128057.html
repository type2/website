Subject: No Power to Coil

&quot;The wire running from the ignition switch has what looks like a fuse 
holder.  I can't find the fuse, if there was one, that was in there.  
With 
the key turned to the &quot;on&quot; position, there is no power to this wire.&quot;
 
The wire with the fuse holder is for the reverse lights, it won't be hot unless you are in reverse... You need to find the one hot wire that supplies juice TO the coil.
