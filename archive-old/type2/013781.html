&gt;Does anyone know of a vendor that makes lowered spindles for bay window
&gt;busses?  I tried Wolfgang International, but it doesn't look like it.
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;

Simon:

I inquired about the same thing with Wolfgang Intl., and as of a month ago, they had been working on drop spindles, but were putting them on hold &quot;for a while&quot;.  They did say they'd have them eventually.  If you call or e-mail them to ask, try and talk to Steve, he seems to know what's going on with the spindles.
