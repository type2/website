Hi Volks!

Sigh... my previous post (T does not mean Type) and its use of 
&quot;flat-four&quot; will further confuse everyone in this thread I fear.  So 
allow me to clarify:

A Type 1 engine comes either as an &quot;upright&quot;, which means that its 
blower housing is located above the engine, or a &quot;flat&quot;, with its 
blower behind the engine block (RIR).  The former was used in the 
Type 1 (Bug et.al.), Type 2/T1 (Splitty) and Type 2/T2 (Bay).  The 
latter was used in the Type 3, and something similar in the Type 2/T3 
(Vanagon) in Europe, which I believe is what Andrew might have if 
it's in a Vanagon.

Type 4 engines, or &quot;pancakes&quot;, always are &quot;flat&quot; in this sense, i.e. 
with their blower behind the engine block (unless custom-converted to 
upright blowers for use in a Bug or such).

But confusion arises from the English (as a language) use of &quot;flat&quot; 
to describe a boxer engine, where the cylinders indeed lie &quot;flat&quot; 
instead of &quot;standing (more or less) upright&quot; like they do in other 
engine types.  This is the sense in which I used &quot;flat-four&quot; in my 
previous posting, and which Andrew might have meant if he has a Bay 
or a Splitty.

Sorry for the confusion, and about the bandwidth.

&gt; There is no difference.  The &quot;flat&quot; DP 1600 is an upright or Type 1
&gt; engine with cooling fan similar to the Type 3.  In fact the upright
&gt; and flat 1600 Type 1 engine originated in the Type 3.
&gt;
&gt; However, you should note that this engine was never marketed by VW in
&gt; North America, where a flat 4 always refers to a Type 4 engine.

&gt; &gt; What is the difference between an up-right, Flat4 &amp; Pancake? In
&gt; &gt; England I have a DP 1600 &quot;flat4&quot; is this the same as an up-right? 

Yours,
    Erik.
