Subject: Re: static timing light, make your own...

Derrick,

With due respects to the excellent instructions offered by Tom, I 
thought I give you another option to make a timing light.

Many years ago I made a static timing light which has been just about 
indestructible through many entries and exits from my tool box, not 
always with as much care as I should have used.

Most Japanese motor cycles have small lights in their instrument 
clusters. These lights are usually a rubber encased setup into 
which you insert a small 12 volt bulb. The rubber casing 
presses up into the instrument and is very easy to remove. Normally 
there are two wires coming from the rubber casing. Obtain one of 
these lights from a motorcycle wrecker, or your old disused Jap rat 
bike if you have one, attach an alligator clip to the end of each 
of the wires and you have your static timing light. 

I connect one alligator clip to the coil and the other end to the 
throttle linkage. On a single carb engine the little horizontal bar 
that holds the throttle return spring is a good spot to get a good 
ground. My bulb hangs just above the fuel pump and when I get to TDC 
it lights up the whole engine bay.
