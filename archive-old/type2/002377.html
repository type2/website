&gt; O' Mighty List,
&gt; I have a 1.7L T-IV, I think it's a 73, installed by the PO in my
&gt; 1977 bay window. It has a weber carb and it runs okay. It has passed
&gt; smog inspection here in AZ with flying colors, but, I'm thinking of
&gt; putting the solex carbs back in. I have a pair of used solex carbs that
&gt; need to be re-built. My question is, (finally), what can I use to replace
&gt; the x-shaped crossover pipes with that I see in diagrams between the
&gt; carbs which of course I do not have, nor have I seen one in any
&gt; junkyards here in Phoenix. Does any of this make sense? This engine is
equipped with an 009 distributor and empi exhaust.
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; Jeff and the Friojle Grande
&gt;
