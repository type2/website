Melissa,

The best way to check this would be to turn on the parking lights, and
see which wires have current. The wires that are for the side marker and
rear parling light should be hot while the other should not be. I tried
to check on my '71 bus, but the taillight wiring has been modified so
much it is hard to tell anymore (oh well, one more thing to fix). I hope
this helps you some.

Jonathan

P.s. the side markers on this bus wernt hooked up when I got it either.

List, 

i am still battling with the lights issue I have had on my 71 westy. I
have 
front turns, headlights, parking lights all around. No rear brake lights
or 
turn signals. The rear side markers aren't hooked up at all. 
This is what I have. In the rear left light i have two brown ground
wires 
going to the respective ground spot on the light housing. One of these
is a 
stand alone wire, one is wrapped with another wire, appears to be green
or 
grey with black stripe. This wire (green/grey) has current and is going
to 
the left prong on the housing. it joins a stand alone wire yellow with
black 
dots. Then alone on the right prong is the Black with yellow stripe
wire. I 
am getting current to all those correctly except the brown ground wires
(as 
it should). I reviewed the wiring diagram so graciously sent me, but the

colors dont appear clear the diagram. It looks as though one ground and
one 
of my positive current wires now running to my rear taillight should be 
running to the side markers. Any idea which ones. 
I am at a bit of a disadvantage as i dont have anyone to press the
brakes for 
me as I check the currents. 
Any help is appreciated! 
Thanks all!
Melissa
71 westy
