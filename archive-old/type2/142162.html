Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] new factory 1600DP motors??

&gt; week. I went to buy a new set of seats. They had a huge pile (at least a
&gt; 100 sets of front, middle and rear) in the yard. They were the 'rubbish'

It's too bad it would probably cost a fortune to ship some of these to
North America.  I'm missing both rear seats (my Dad took the pristine
originals to the dump when he transplanted the interior from a
camper).  The springs are broken in my front seats (yes, physically
broken, not just worn out).  The new Brazilian ones look pretty nice.
