&gt; I have problem I need some help with, my oil dummy light is doing some 
&gt; wacko things.
&gt; Of coarse when I start the Van up the oil light comes for just a 
&gt; second and while I sit there everything is fine. When I back out of 
&gt; the drive, everything is fine, when I put my brakes on, my oil light 
&gt; lights up until I stop for a second. If I drive real fast and have to 
&gt; apply the brakes real hard the oil light comes on. If I am sitting on 
&gt; a hill with the bus' rear end up in the ait the oil light comes on.
