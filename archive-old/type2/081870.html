Subject: Re: [T2] Locking filler door

If you really want to use a locking gas cap rather than modifying your door,
just take your tank to a radiator shop or welding shop, with the neck to a
tank that will accept a locking cap.  A reputable shop can handle this  kind
of modification, and you won't have to put a hole in the sheet metal.  Plus,
IF someone wanted in there that bad, at least they'd screw up a cheap cap,
rather than tear up your fuel door and fender.

Just a thought.

&gt; Sure, I've seen lots of clasp hinges with padlocks.  I can't believe
anyone
&gt; would be so crude.  If you must have a locking door, you can get nice lock
&gt; mechanisms for a few bucks at the hardware store that only require a small
&gt; round hole be cut into the door and perhaps a small L-bracket mounted to
&gt; the body inside the door.  I'd still rather not have a lock - I'd rather
&gt; have someone steal all 15 gallons of gas than take a screwdriver to my
&gt; locked filler door and do $200 worth of body damage.  As for people who
&gt; like to dump stuff in gas tanks, they are rare enough that I don't worry
&gt; about it.
