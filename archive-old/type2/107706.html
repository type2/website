Subject: Re: [T2] Loose valve seats

Den, any idea why upright engine valve seats don't seem to be as much a
problem as type4 ones do? Is it because the type 4 makes more power? Tom

ps My bus engine has an aluminum plate riveted on over the original number-
I also wondered who did that.

I had to share this...it's a hoot

I've had literally hundreds of heads in my hands over the years, but
this set I bought at Buckeye on the weekend were a first...

1.8 L carb style, clean as a whistle on the valve spring side with new
springs...turn em over, and two intake seats are sitting up proudly
about 1/16&quot; above the chamber...no big deal says I, I know a shop
