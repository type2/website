Subject: Re: [T2] 96mm piston upgrade

2.0 FI heads have small valves.( 37.5 X 33 )
Even the 1.7 L 914 are bigger ( 39.3 X 33 ). These will fit with a flycut.
For this larger displacement, find a pair of 1.8 carb heads ( 41 X 34 )
or have yours modified, with new seats and mild port matching.
Additional breathing ( like the vents in 914 heads ) is a good idea.
Consider dual carbs for more, direct intake, and a non-stock muffler.
Choose a cam for torque over horsepower ( for the towing application ).

&gt;Has anyone put 96mm pistons in their 2.0l engine. We have a 77 and wanted to
&gt;pump it up a little for a little extra towing power. Thruway driving and
&gt;country travels. Any suggestions, also putting a higher lift cam. ggod or
&gt;bad. thanks Dylan and Stephanie
