&lt;&lt; Is there any reason a person couldn't bore out the lug holes a bit to go 
on the VW studs? Is it going to require machine shop work or would a big drill 
be enough? 

Also weren't the lug nut mating surface (with the wheel to lug nut surface) 
different? Just gather the right nuts?  &gt;&gt;

I hogged out my M-B wheels with a 14 mm drill... I also used a ball grinder to
dish the steel inserts in the M-B's bolt holes to let the VW mushroom lug
nuts seat against the wheel ...
