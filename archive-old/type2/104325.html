Subject: Re: [T2] Future of the type IV engine?

Hi Andy:

Theoretically you are right. But in practice most of the type IV engines I
have seen for the heavier buses/ Vanagons have been overheated at some point
in their life and have elongated bores. Now admittedly my sampling is small,
but this theory is born out by my communication with machine shops that work
on the type IV's and my search for a case in good shape that will meet
specification for standard bearings (pmail if you want all their names and
responses). All the shops have align bored cases available, but nothing
provably in standard bore. What happened to all those bulletproof cases? All
on the road?

My point is that at some point regardless of the quality of work done by the
assembler or the additional parts, we run into the problem that the source of
good used cases will run out. What machine shop does the following on a
routine basis to provide a case at factory specification (or better):

&gt; When VW reconditioned cases (up until 1968) they did far more than just line bore. To properly recondition a case
&gt; today consists of; cleaning the case, bolting it together with an alignment bar in the crank and cam tunnel, torquing to
&gt; stress relief specifications. Have the case stress relieved for 3-1/2 hours and let cool in the oven. When cool, take it
&gt; out of the oven and re-torque to stress relief specifications and again stress relief for 3-1/2 hours. When cool remove
&gt; from the oven and disassemble, remove all of the studs and alignment pins, machine both halves of the case flat and
&gt; reinstall all of the studs and pins and torque to running torque specifications. Now, line bore the crank, and cam tunnel,
&gt; often back to standard, bore the oil pump, pulley, flywheel seal holes and the cam seal groove. Lastly, the brass drive
&gt; gear must be cut smaller on the OD the same amount that the 3 and 4 side of the case was machined.
&gt;
Why should we accept second rate parts and what can we do about it?
