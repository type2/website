Subject: Re: [T2] Westy interior panel patterns

Personally I can only do the 68-72 era since that is what I and the others
seem to have available right now. But later if there is interest I would be
happy to make some drawings for that too. Hal if you can measure the
headliner as best you can that would be great. I will work on making the
final hard copies (Russell is going to do the sliding door for everyone) and
then I'll make blueprints for anyone who want them. I will add a link to it
on my website so Bus people not on the list can have access too!

I have been using ACAD for about 6 years, but never upgraded from 14. I can
send the drawings out so anyone who wants them as a .dwg file and of course
bluebrints or probably drawings on bond paper off of my plotter. I just used
the term blueprints so everyone would be familiar with what I meant.

I feel very good about helping out people who need this!

Have a good weekend all!

Rob &amp; Russell,

I'd be happy to measure the wood headliner pieces from my 71 Westy.  I don't
have any AutoCad skills, but I'd be happy to mail you both poster sized
printouts of the files after they were done.
If you want me to measure the panels and there is any particular advice I
should know, please let me know what it is.
Hal Landvoigt
