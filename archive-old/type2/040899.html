Possible.  I had already ruled that out since you said the compression was
140 all around, but if that test was not done since the problem started,
you should do another compression check.  That should always be your first
step.

&gt;I'll try your test with the gas, though I think you mean the driver's side
&gt;carb.

Yes, I did.  Sorry for the typo (although in the U.K. it wouldn't have been
wrong!)
