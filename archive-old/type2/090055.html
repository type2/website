Subject: Tires again- LI 92 is not enough

&gt;Not to start another tire thread, but my rear
tire is &quot;C&quot; load rated for 1433 lbs.  It's 6 ply
but not reinforced in the sidewall.  Since it
only has to bear ~930 lbs it would seem a &quot;D&quot;
rated is overkill but since the D tires are
usually 8 ply I understand why people choose
them.

First, the &quot;C&quot; in the stock spec is for
COMMERCIAL, not load range C.  And a load range
&quot;C&quot; tire rated for 1433 is not enough.  I'm sure
these are 195/75/14's, right?  

The reason that 185R14C (the C is commercial) or
load range D tires or 185R14-Rf are helpful is
because of the stiff sidewalls limiting sway.  

I know of no 195/75/14 LRC tire that has a load
index comparable to a 185R14C or 185R14RF.  

&gt;The age of my rear tires must factor greatly in
their inability to handle the bus in the
crosswinds.

No, the lack of a reinforced or commercial
sidewall is why they sway.  They would sway if
they were brand spanking new. 

&gt;Seems the Continental CR21RF tires that Nemo
found are the way to go.

They would be a perfect tire also.  Dr. Tim says
so.  And VW says so.  

&gt;It must be 92 load rated.  

NO, NO, NO.  92 is only 1389 lbs.  IT IS NO WHERE
NEAR ENOUGH.  ALMOST EVERY NONREINFORCED
PASSENGER TIRE IS 92 OR ABOVE.  All the 185R14C
and 185R14RF tires had load ranges in the
95-96-97 range.  (This idea comes from the
195/75/14 folks who mistakenly think the &quot;C&quot; in
the Bentley spec is load range C, even though
Bentley is clear on the subject.  See the tire
page.  And 195/75/14 LRC tires only hold about
1400lbs, therefore 92-93 is enough.  Bentley does
not support this.) 

&gt;Note that when you go to 15 inch tires with the
new  minimums for dot a while back most basic 15
inch tires meet the requirements plus a lower
profile (65 vs 75). 

I don't know that this helps much.  There
precious few 205/65/15 tires that meet spec for
load range and max pressure.   Agilis and Nokian
come to mind.  And of course,
they are still pricey.  There is a larger
selection of LT215/75/15 with appropriate load
rating and max pressure, but not everyone has the
desire and engine to run these.  

The tire page has been updated, but is still far,
far from done.  (I did it about two in the
morning a few days ago and now I don't understand
why I arranged it the way I did.)  Send comments
please and I'll addyour opinions.
