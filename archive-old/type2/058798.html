Oly exclaimed.......

&lt;&lt;After much debate I chose to go with the rebuilt
transaxle rather than roll the dice on a tested used
one.  I intend to drive this Dormobile for years to come
and that out weighted the $200 price difference.&gt;&gt;

Thats one of the main reasons why I do not sell or 
recommend used transaxles.  At least with an engine 
there are some tests you can do but with a transaxle 
you pretty much takes your chances.  Yes, there are
used parts in my rebuilds but at least you know that
someone has had it apart and replaced those pieces
that are past their wear limits.  

&lt;&lt;  I didn't realize a bus wasn't supposed to howl 
so loud you could  hardly hear the radio at hwy 
speed!  It had made that noise since purchase 
and I thot it was part of the deal.  and shifting is a 
breeze!  &gt;&gt;

While this isn't one of my gearboxes (I did try to sell
him one!) this is a common 'finding' by my customers.
Most folks don't know that you should be able to talk 
at a normal volume at highway speeds and should be 
able to find the gear you want when you want to.   If 
you have to yell like a Banshee just to be heard over 
the transaxle howl then thats a good indication that 
maybe your gearbox is just about gone and might 
need to be 'recycled'.

Happy shifting.
