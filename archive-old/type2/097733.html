&lt;&lt; Think about it.  The reason that it feels cooler to the touch is that it
isn't transmitting as much heat through the metal to you.  A thermos
bottle is cool to the touch as well, but it keeps its contents hot!

There was a good reason why VW went with thin metal covers.  They transmit
heat well, they flex a bit to conform to the gasket surface, and they were
cheap to make.

My first guess would be your sequence is probably reversed...:-)

My finned cover closely resembles the fins on the VW cyl-
inder and act as an effective heat sink because of the in-
creased mass and surface area.
