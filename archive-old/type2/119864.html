Subject: GEX Motor

Hey Mike,

     I too bought a Bus in similar condition. I've owned it for about 6
months, and dropped maybe 700 bucks into it. New window seals, lots of
parts from the junkyard to make it complete, all new chrome (well,
polished aluminum), etc.  When I bought my Bus, it was completely
disassembled, but did have a new rebuilt GEX motor, and transmission. So
far, the GEX motor has been pretty decent to me. I've driven it ABOUT..
well.. maybe 300 miles since I purchased it... so it remains to be seen
how it will last. I can tell you though, by looking at it, whether this
was the fault of the previous owner, or GEX themselves.. it seems a lot
of the stuff on the motor was re-installed half-assed.

Overall, I'm happy with it, but I've heard continuous horror stories
about these motors.

Todd

&gt;Ted,
&gt; 
&gt;      So there might be hope. I am having problems though. I have driven

&gt;this ride only about 1 mi. totall. This is just like I just got it but
it is 
&gt;spend some time with her, feel her out every knook and crannie. But mean

&gt;while I have to research th epros and cons of the GEX heart of this new
gal.
&gt; 
&gt;Thanks, 
&gt;Michael Knight
