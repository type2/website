cooled...
&gt; I find this curious, as my contacts in Mexico who happen to own
several VW
&gt; dealerships tell me that the only engine available is the water cooled
&gt; Rabbit converted engine.

All buses made in Brazil have 1600cc dual-carb upright air-cooled
engines.  They have a front end just like a late-model baywindow.

The 1800cc digifant golf-engined buses were manufactured in Mexico,
and the engine installation was designed by Volkswagen de Mexico. 
These are the ones with the radiator grill in the front.  This
combination seems to work much better than the waterboxer.  There
might be some sort of arrangement to have these made in Brazil for the
Mexican market, but this seems unlikely considering the protectionist
nature of the Mexican government toward its auto industry.  That's why
VW built a plant there in the first place!

Get the drool-towels out before you go to the above sites! :)
