Subject: Timing your Volkswagen -- memo to the file (long)

Volks, 

Executive Summary:

The proper of timing for your Volkswagen depends on the distributor you
have installed on your bus or bug... *NOT* on the body, *NOT* on the
crankcase!!!!

TYPE 4 DISTRIBUTORS: 
The following applies to all distributors that came stock on the type 4
series engines (021 905 205 series distributors):

Vacuum Advance Distributors (one hose) are timed to 7.5 BTDC at 800-950
RPM, with the vacuum hose on.

Vacuum Advance/Vacuum Retard Distributors (two hoses) are *generally*
timed to 5 ATDC at 800-950 RPM with both vacuum hoses on, except the 021
905 205 J and N distributors which get timed to 10 ATDC, hoses on.

TYPE 1 DISTRIBUTORS:
For Type1 engines, the available distributor range is *much* wider! For
the stock vacuum-only dists, tho (113 205 905 M or T, and 111 205 905 AA),
the timing is at TDC with the vacuum hose off and plugged

Karl Von Saltzen adds (for type1 engines):
&quot;Also another thing: I believe there are 4 different crank pulleys for a
type1 engine. Only 2? have a mark for TDC! Unless you check cam timing to
TDC and see what mark [if one even lines up!] is at the case split, your
timing specs aren't worth the paper they are printed on....&quot;

So if you are not sure, get out your pencil, pull the #1 plug and make
sure that what the pulley says is TDC is really TDC!!! or buy and install
a degree wheel pulley.

CENTRIFUGAL ADVANCE DISTRIBUTORS (009/050)
Are timed to 27-30 BTDC at 3000 RPM (full advance) (others will
disagree... this is conservative, but I would rather not have anyone say,
&quot;I set it to what you said and toasted my engine.&quot; Less advance = less
power, but less heat as well!)

OVERALL:
If you are not dead flat certain which dist you have or where to time it,
post to the list.  Include the part number of the distributor!  It is
stamped on the side of the case and will have the format: 
nnn 905 205 a
where nnn will be numbers and a will be a letter.  

===========================================================================

Now, the rest of the story:

IMPORTANT NOTE: Tho I refer to &quot;the '73&quot; and &quot;the '80&quot; below, understand
that this is *only* for ID purposes...  The FI and ignitions installed on
both vans is that of a '78 federal model bus.

I am just about finished with the *most* frustrating day I have had in a
while :-( Last fall it was time to renew my licence plates on the '73.
Here in Virginia, we have to get a smog check on all vehicles that ever
had to meet a spec, no age exemptions. Well, I thought that it oughta meet
the spec pretty handily as I have a new rebuild (&lt;1K miles) in it, with
the '78 FI installed.  It had run pretty as a picture up to this point,
but I figured it was tune up time and off to the emissions station.

Because I was very short on time (A lot was happening in my life back
then), I brought it to a mechanic to have it tuned and inspected. Well,
they called and said &quot;It won't idle, probably something wrong in the AFM&quot;
so I brought them a different AFM, heck I brought them two different AFM's
(I have this basement full of VW parts :-) Neither worked, and the damned
thing would not idle.  I was still busy, they gave up, I brought it home
and put it in the garage and proceeded to get on with my life (which was
still a bit busy :-)  

I finally (under parental pressure) got back to work on it this weekend
and have spent a day and a half trying to figure out what was wrong.  It
started fine and would run as long as I gave it a bit of gas, but was
gutless and would not idle, no matter how far out the idle screw was
adjusted. Flipped a couple AFM's in and out, since this shop had seemed to
think that was where the problem lay, checked the decel valve (per Karl's
instructions), made sure that all the vacuum hoses were tight and on.
Nothing, nada zip.... would not idle.  The complicating factor is that I
am alone, and getting it started and running and then racing to the rear
before it died was wearing, to say the least :-(

This whole time, tho, I believed that the ignition was set correctly and
functioning (usually my first check) because it had been done byt the shop
and I had esentially 0 miles since then.  As a check, I set up the
dwell/tach and checked the dwell.... 49 degrees, right on!  Since it would
not idle, checking timing was impossible.

Well, I finally decide it was time to start the &quot;parts flop&quot; between the
running '80 and the non-running '73.  Just flop one part at a time 'til
the bus starts to run.   It is the stupidest way to diagnose, tho
foolproof, and I only fall back to this after all else has failed.  The
first thing I flopped was the ignition system (I was *still* a bit
suspicious) and Lo! and Behold! with the distributor and wires from the
'80 installed, the damn thing runs.  Runs sweet! check dwell... 50.3,
check timing - ~6-7.5 BTDC.

I then tried to install the dist from the '73 in the 80 and could not...
the condensor ran into the oil pressure sender. It was cranked a good 10
degrees to clockwise of where it shoulda been.  What I think happened is
that the shop timed the engine to the body, not the dist.  In '73, the
stock dist would have been a dual vac advance/retard model to go with the
dual carbs and would have been timed to 5 BTDC.  On my bus, tho, the dist
is a vac advance model that gets timed to 7.5 ATDC... A *big*
difference!!! So tomorrow, I am off to get an initial read on the
emissions :-)

'73 Westy (ready (I hope) for VA emissions inspection)
'80 Westy (runs just fine now that has the stock 2L engine!  (thanks, John! :-)
