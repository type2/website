Subject: Lost my keys!!!

Ok... well, looks like I lost the keys to my VW Bus. I know, I know. I've
never lost keys to any car before in my life... but this time I did.
 
Anyway, what do I need? Steering wheel puller, etc?
 
I figured I would just get an entirely new lock cyl. Do they sell those?
 
 
 
Thanks,
