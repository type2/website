Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Clutch for Sure

I know if I ask my supplier for a Sacks clutch kit, I get Henco en Mexico 
disk, German TO bearing and plate. If I ask for an OEM clutch disk as a 
separate part, I am still getting German. It costs only a little more to 
order the parts separately. I have noted issues with the Mexican disk rivet 
presses. Looks like hand done on a stump in the back yard compared to the 
perfectly formed/forged items on the genuine article. As regards quality 
assembly of machine parts, no one can touch the Germans. In the plants 
around the world that are supervised by German engineers, and the 
production must meet German inspections, the quality is also superb. If a 
single malformed rivet is seen, it's stop the presses and find out why and 
correct it before you ruin any more rivets. But if they just give the 
machine tools and operation manuals to someone and walk away like they have 
done in Mexico, immediate loss of quality is apparent.

The worst thing about it is, just as soon as the German parts are put out 
of business by the cheap goods that the majority of fools buy cause they 
are cheaper, the price of the cheap goods rises rapidly to near the cost of 
the NLA real parts. Now junk costs a premium price and you can't find a 
proper functional part for any price.

&gt;Hmm, after the second Sachs friction disk delaminated in 70,000 mi (the
&gt;orginal lasted 150,000mi), I replaced it with a LUK from BUSDEPOT-
&gt;shifts like butter now (for about 30K mi), no chatter or vibration.
