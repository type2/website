Subject: RE: [T2] Why VW buses die

Ftbllfn4lf,

Ya gotta remember what list this is though.

This is where folks talk about their T2's and the problems and a fair 
number of people on the list are &quot;newbies&quot; to their T2's.

Might not be much fun if every one here reported that their 30 year old 
buses were running just fine every morning, now would it?&lt;big grin&gt;


Cheers ,dave

&gt; It seems that my vehicles' demise usually start
&gt; when the air conditioner breaks.  Then the tranny
&gt; goes, then the oil consumption increases, etc. In the
&gt; case of my last American car, when it got to that
&gt; point, I traded it for my first type 2.  The vehicle
&gt; didn't stop getting real service, just became unenjoyable
&gt; to drive.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I have a Taurus with 150,000 miles on it.  The A/C needs a manifold hose, 
&gt; about $500 w/labor. The wiper switch needs replacing; I have a alarm box that 
&gt; has dangled down because the PO tried to tear it out of the car plus it is 
&gt; very rusty.  So, I am in the market for a different vehicle myself. Which 
&gt; brings me to the required type 2 content.  I would love to own a type 2, but 
&gt; I have some reservations.  1.  I can only afford 1 vehicle so it would have 
&gt; to be my daily driver.  2 not sure how it would go in the ice and snow 
&gt; assuming we have any this year (after this drought who knows). And, 3.  the 
&gt; endless horror stories I read from people about break downs.  I only commute 
&gt; around town and am not afraid to tinker with it.  Add to that the scarcity of 
&gt; type 2s for sale in my area and you can see why I am reluctant.  Dave.
