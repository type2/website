No question about it, the 2 Liter would be my choice.  

The cost of building a 1776 of EQUAL quality and durability to the stock 2 
liter would NOT save you much.  The key thing to consider is what it would 
cost you to get a 1776 that will last as long as the 2 liter.  Check the Berg 
web page out to see what they go for.

Your will need to design and custom build all of the engine tin that would 
have to fit around the 1776 to seal the engine compartment and prevent heated 
air form recycling back through.  It all comes stock with the 2 liter.

You will get more reliable horsepower from the 2 liter, it can easily last 
over 120,000 miles (the type 1 motor in a bus usually lasts to about 75,000 
miles), It has a spin on full flow oil filter, bigger oil cooler, bigger 
valves, larger diameter clutch, bigger main bearings, an aluminum case, 
better oiling and exhaust.  All stock!

The 2 liter will have hydraulic lifters and if you are really lucky you may 
be able to get all of the fuel injection equipment.  It is much superior 
system to any aftermarket carb system you will find.  I had always been a 
carb believer UNTIL I experienced fuel injection in a VW.  It does require 
some study to learn and troubleshoot, but then I have had PLENTY of 
opportunity to do that with carbs too over a lot of years.

The type IV appeared in 1969 as VW's next generation of air cooled engines.  
It was designed to be more powerful, more durable and longer lasting than the 
type 1.

You definately can build a strong oversize type 1 motor. It can be built to 
last just as long as a stock type 1 motor.  

Evaluate the cost of doing this and what its lifespan in your bus will be, 
then compare this to the cost of the 2 liter and its lifespan.
