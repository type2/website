Subject: '71 Poptop, seats

I've recently acquired a '71 bus with what I assumed was a Westphalia 
interior - looks like other westies I've seen. Except that it has a small 
pop-top, one of the 'standing room only' type that lifts straight up.

I've heard that VW stopped putting these on buses before '71. Is this 
right? Does that mean that mine is an after-market top? My problem is 
that some of the hardware on the top is shot - these small plates with 2 
white plastic wheels attached, which roll in tracks when the top goes 
up/down. Any hints on good sources for pop-top parts?

I'm also looking to replace the standard front seats with seats with 
headrests (due to nasty whiplash when my last bus was killed in a 
rear-ender). I've heard that this is not an easy job, and I'm looking for 
any folks who have succeeded doing it. I would definitely prefer not to 
weld, or do any other body reconstruction. Ideas?

Thanks!

Jon
