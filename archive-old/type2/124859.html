Subject: Re: [T2] Re: What shocks do you prefer

Sorry Richard but as I said the shocks came with a bus that I bought about 9
years ago so I do not know where to find a new ones. The PO was a very VW
knowlege guy (the first time I saw the 76, she has a 2500 cc engine upon a
full balanced Okrasa crankshaft and some kind of diferential blocker in the
trans, that I insisted in toke it out in favor of the originals, I was naif
and stupid at that time) so I tend to beleive he put the right shocks, I
think there are for 68-79, becuase I checked the numbers a few years back
and as far I remenber they are the ones.
