Subject: RE: [T2] Proposed Engine Swap

Just MY 2cents here , I have a 74 bus running a 2000 with a single webber
progressive carb on it . I have been running this setup for 2+ yrs now and
have had no probs at all . I know of a few other buses with the same setup
and they are having a trouble free ride.

Subject: [T2] Proposed Engine Swap


Hello Listees,
I just returned from a meeting with my local VW
mechanic who was pricing parts for my planned rebuild.
 I have a 1972 engine that is in need of new
cylinders, pistons, heads and gaskets.  As a friend of
mine asked me this week, &quot;Is that it??&quot;.  The total
estimate (not including shipping to Montana) was going
be close to that of a re-built 1800cc engine.  After
seeing the frown on my face he showed me a 1979 bus he
has in his yard that looked like hell, but the engine
looked good.  According to him it was a sweet running
engine.  He was going to remove the 2.0 liter engine,
keep the new-looking tires and junk the rest.  He
offered me the entire bus for $600.  I am considering
the offer and I would like to know a few things first.

1.  Will the 1979 2.0L, single carbed engine set up
for an automatic transmission fit into my 1972 manual
transmission bus?  He proposed swapping flywheels and
clutches and replacing the main seal.  From what I can
tell from Wilson is that the mounting can be done.

2.  I will be returning to his shop tomorrow so we can
fire up the engine.  I would like to see the
compression numbers from the 2.0L at a minimum.  Is
there anything else obvious that I should ask him or
have checked out?

3.  If I were to purchase a re-built engine, I would
likely be spending $500-700 more than I would for the
1979 2.0L.  A 12,000 mile - 1 year warranty isn't
worth that much is it?

Thanks in advance and I appreciate the support to
date.
