Subject: Help - Servo one carb

I just purchased a 72 bus that has been converted to a single Weber carb.  
Therefore, the manifold has been changed out.  How in the world does the servo 
unit connect into this system now?  The servo is intact and the hoses are 
there, it's just been cut back at the engine.  The brake pedal on this thing is so 
hard!  What can I do?
