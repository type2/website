Subject: Re: [T2] re: Valve adjusting screws

&gt;  Any comments or similar experiences?


I almost got stranded in Lassen Volcanic this summer when one of those 
(newly replaced) screws broke. It had lasted about 2 weeks, and then 
cracked in half.  The bolt and half the screw was bouncing around inside 
the valve cover as well. What I ended up doing was putting the rounded end 
(that actuates the valve) into the rocker and tightening it down with less 
than 1 thread in the bolt. then I tightened down the bolt as hard as i 
could. this gave be about .7mm when .25mm is what is recommended. The 
cylinder was firing though, and I made it back to Redding where I found 
Busboys. I bought all their adjustments screws just in case the other one 
that i'd replaced decided to break in half. This is why preventative 
maintenance is a bad thing ( tongue in cheek ).
