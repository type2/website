&gt; I used to run Autocrosses in my '84 GTI (I bought new).  I'd be  tempted to
&gt; try it in the Bopmobile just for grins.  Up and down  Lookout Mountain is a
&gt; blast.  It won't hold the road like my Jags  but it's still fun.   Random
&gt; thoughts from a (now) VW nut....KR

   It's easy to drive a fast car fast...But dangerous to drive it at its
limit...
(I've buried both the tach and the speedo in a Vette, but I was immortal,
then... ;-(
Drivin' my Bugeye at its limit is &quot;safe&quot; fun...(Even if the traffic is
passin'
me... ;-)
