Subject: sorry about that

 here we go: I have an &quot;85 westy that I really enjoy. It is my first and
only vw. But recently I saw an older model I believe it to be a 66 split
window and I thought that's awesome.  So can anyone give me a &quot;quick&quot;
rundown on

Wade,
Your questions could be better answered on either the vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com
mailing list (for 1967 and back VW Busses) or the
vanagon_at_gerry.vanagon_dot_com list (for 1980 and on VW Vanagons).
The type2_at_type2_dot_com list covers the 1968 to 1982.5 VW Busses and
aircooledavanagons.

To subscribe to the vintagebus list send a blank email to:
vintagebus-subscribe_at_type2_dot_com

To subscribe to the vanagon list, send an email to:
LISTSERV_at_GERRY.VANAGON.COM

The body of this email should contain:
