&gt;Dielectric grease is an anti-corrosion lubricant that is conductive.

Anti-corrosion is correct but it's actually non-conductive. Only put it on an eletrical connection after the terminals have made contact.

&gt;I use it all the time on every connector (even a dab on the top o'
&gt;the spark plugs...;-) 

The connection is probably squeezing some grease away making metal to metal contact. The grease is mainly used to seal the spark plug boots in order keep water out.
