can you take the bits you need off your old longblock?

there should be air flaps in the fan housing, with a rod going down between
the cylinder on the L side of the motor to connect to the thermostat.  Much
easier to mess with with the motor out.  Thermostats help the motor warm up
quicker, decreasing wear and increasing longitivity, although you don't -NEED-
it to run, it is a goo thing.


If the old muffler was toast, toss it and get another.  If you cut the old
muffler, notthe heater boxes, you can get the junk off the heater boxes and
reuse them.  Usually a hammer a chisel will do the trick.  A grinder may be
needed, but be careful not to cut into the heater boxes themselves.

I dislike J tubes.  Think they are APOC

You need a distributor drive gear.  

While the motor is out, check other things- such as..
 change the gear oil.  You don't mention the year of the bus, other than it
takes an upright motor.
  If it is a splitty, check the tranny boots and replace if they are torn or
cracked.
  If your fuel line is old, replace it.   
Take off the clutch cable wingnut, and clean up the threads at the end of the
clutch cable.  Grease them and replace the wingnut.   This will make it much
easier to adjust the clutch later.

If the sending unit in the gas tank is kaput, now is a good time to change it.

there are probably some other things I'm forgetting, but these are some
suggestions.  Hope it Helps,

Clara
