&lt;&lt; Dear List,
I am planning to make an awning out of a tarp to attach to my 73 Westy =
with Poptop (original idea from the Type2 library).
The original plans were for a Vanagon, which I am unfamiliar with.=20
Any ideas/suggestions on how this type of home-made awning would best be =
attached to the bus, for a good seal?

Thanks,

The best way to make your own awning is to sew a pocket along the edge where 
you can slip a length of rod inside.  You set this in your raingutter and 
then attach it with small clamps.  This is the way our Sunsail awnings and 
side tent attach.  I have the poles and clamps for an 11 foot wide awning 
available for $21.95 plus shipping.

You can also consider adding an awning rail.  I've seen these rails attached 
to Westy rain gutters using a 2 piece aluminum rail that fits over the gutter 
and then the 2 aluminum parts are screwed or riveted together.  Most RV 
suppliers have these rails.  I have the strip material that you sew to your 
awning and then slide in this rail.  The Sunsail awning has both the pocket 
and the strip to work with either system.
