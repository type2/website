Subject: '66 progress, paint and body

Hi all,

Just a report on the exterior transformation that has occured on
my '66 standard microbus.

I wrestled with the decision to have the bodywork and paint done
for quite a while before I took it in.  I weighed the pluses and
minuses quite a bit:

  Positive things:

  - The bus will look *much* better. (couldn't possibly look worse!)
  - The body of the bus will be better protected from the weather.
  - The cargo bay doors will open and close better when they're straight.
  - If the top of the bus is painted white, it'll keep it cooler inside.
  - More pride in ownership will lead me to work harder on the interior.

  Negative things:

  - The bus will look *much* better. (I'll worry more about scratches,etc.)
  - I'll have to fork over some money.
  - The interior will look much worse in comparison.
  - More pride in ownership will make it a worse money sink.

Well, notice that there are 5 positives and only 4 negatives!!  The positives
won so in a fit of selfish vanity, I took it in to Maaco about 1.5 weeks ago.

Got it back last night.

Now, there were quite a few dent, and dings, as well as a few holes in the
roof where I took that air-conditioner off last spring and I had *all*
of these fixed.  This included redoing some very old body work on the
left-rear panel that had cracked a bit.  I also went for the best paint
they have, a polyurethane base-coat/clear-coat with the longest guarantee.
They pulled most of the exterior stuff off before they painted except the
windows which they masked.  I'll be pulling the windows soon to replace
the headliner and window rubber anyway so I think it'll work out OK.

It looks good!  Actually better than I expected.  They body guy actually
got the sides quite straight and the paint, although it has a little
orange-peel, is very even and shiney with no runs or noticable over-spray.
I had 'em paint the large front emblem the same color as the bottom
half of the vehicle and it looks nice on the front.

Of course the 30 year old interior now looks worse in comparison as I
knew it would, but, that was expected.

Color:  The original colors were Titian-Red and Beige-Grey.  I matched
the bottom color, Titian-red, very closely with a Ford paint color called
Currant-red but I opted for a lighter top color, called, I think, Royal-white
(also a Ford color) and I am well pleased with the combination.

I paid $1852.10, about $1000 for body-work and $850 for paint.

Now that the cargo doors are straight, their lack of good sealing rubber
around their perimeter is noticable as they rattle.  But they open and
close like a charm!

Next is window rubber/door rubber/headliner.  Any recommendations for these
would be very welcome!  I'm thinking of getting the rubber from Wolfsberg
West and the headliner from TMI(a J-Bugs company).

Cheers,

 -Dyer
