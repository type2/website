Subject: noise when starting heater

I hear a little screeching on occasion from the heater when I start
it.  Once out of every 12 times it screeches for about 10 seconds then
settles down.

Blower works good, good nice heat. Just wondering if I should grease
something or something?

Ok, since we are on the heat thing. I drove the bus about 1800km this
weekend and the leg back was freakin cold. Problem was the wind.. it
was gusting and the -30 weather was strippin the heat from the van
like no buddies business. I was wrapped up in an old army issue sleeping
bag while dreaming... i mean driving.

But other than the cold I was getting amazing gas mileage (wind was pushing
mostly) and I barely had to touch the gas pedal to keep the van moving at
100-110 km /hour.  It wanted to go faster but I refrained thinking I must
be dreaming.  I hope my car is fixed this week so I won't have to do any
more trips in the van in this cold.

James
