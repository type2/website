Subject: Stub axle

I have a '70 Bus that has, I believe, developed an issue within the stub
axle assembly. I had the splines on the brake drum fail a couple months
ago and I think this preciptated this other failure (presumably one or
both bearings). What I'm looking for is help or hints in doing this job.
Will I need any special tools? What are my chances that the stub axle
itself is damaged? I've already sourced the parts locally but I'm hoping
to limit my downtime so any help or pointers would be appreciated.

Larry
