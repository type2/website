Subject: Re: [T2] Re: valve adjustment 

Steve
How do you know this?    :-)
In my estimation,, they can not be too tight,, as they will be set at .006 &quot;  on
the base circle..... but,, they may not be .006&quot; at the &quot;ignition&quot; timing
mark...
all this means is the &quot;valve&quot; timing is a tiny bit advanced... in relation to
the ignition timing ,, but the clearance is still .006&quot; ....... correct?

----- Original Message ----- 
&gt; Sorry, not true! Adjust the valves on a type 4 engine
&gt; only at TDC on the firing stroke. If you adjust them
&gt; at the loosest point they will be too tight. Ask me
&gt; how I know.
