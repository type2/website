Subject: Re: ideas to keep the bus

Hey all, after having 2 cars stolen, I've learned a few things: 1) A really 
determined thief is gonna get your wheels no matter what you do, and 2) The 
only thing that I've found that has any effect on a would-be thief is a large 
dog in the vehicle. That said, the only thing I do when forced to leave my ' 
78 Westy for any period of time is to remove the steering wheel and take it 
with me. I'm still looking into the legality of the South African Flame 
Thrower Anti-Carjack Device. Man, that would be WAY COOL!!!
