Subject: Re: [T2] Painting Valve Covers:

I bought some of those and had no problems with them, but after thinking 
about it, how much heat is going to be transfered to the valve cover after 
being isolated by that thick cork gasket?

As for painting them, Ron at The Bus Stop sells them at a price that makes 
it not worth spending a lot of time cleaning up old ones!

&gt;Pity that the VW uses the bales for securing the valve covers...My Bugeye
&gt;has an aluminum finned cover that is noticably cooler to the touch than
&gt;the stock &quot;tin&quot; valve cover...The aftermarket covers that have been
&gt;written up on the list don't seem to be reliable enough to justify pur-
&gt;chase...
