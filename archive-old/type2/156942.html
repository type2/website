Subject: RE: Ign Switch

Ric,

Just went through this and did a huge writeup on it.  Probably not in the
archives yet.

Electrical switch:  probably the culprit.

Mechanical lock cylinder:  probably not, but mine was bad (tested with 3
elec. Switches) due to the months of wrenching it to start with gorilla
strength.  Had to replace elec. and mechanical components.

Having to hold the key in place indicates some cylinder barrel trouble to
me.

It CANNOT be replaced in the bus.  There is a hidden spring on the lock
cylinder you have to press down through an access hole in the switch
housing, so you MUST pull it from the bus, but believe me, it is not that
bad.

The hardest part is depressing the spring correctly and pulling the
cylinder.

Google &quot;special patrol group&quot; for a good UK site on early baywindow lock
replacement, feel free to pmail me for any details from someone who recently
did it.

Good luck,

Billy
Murfreesboro, TN

My bus will not run unless the key is held forward and kinda jiggled to keep
it forward. It is getting rapidly worse. Not fun to drive holding the key
on.

What is more likely, the electrical part with wires (easy), or the ignition
switch barrel (hard)? I'm thinking barrel. Anyone done it in the bus
(steering not removed)?

TIA,

Ric
