Actually the mid grade gasoline at most service stations is a blend of
the 'regular' and 'premium' grades.  Only half of it comes out of the
'regular' tank.  My concern in purchasing the top grade gasoline is
that it may have been sitting in the ground for years.  I was a Texaco
retailer and typically we would sell 2500-3000 gallons of regular a
day and 15-20 gallons of premium a week.  Makes a 10,000 gallon tank
last a looonnnnggggg time.

&gt; Be careful and don't buy 89 octane! You may really just be paying for
