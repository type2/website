Subject: Re: [T2] Ouch - Emergency body repair

I have had good results with Bondo IF it was put over solid sheet metal - 
if any moisture can reach it from behind you are back to doing bodywork in 
justa  few months.

Yes, if applied over good metal, in dry weather, and painted quickly it 
will be okay.

I never seem to have all those conditions and now use metal impregnated 
filler everywhere, not much more expensive and alot more appropriate to my 
needs.

Amazing, if use as it was designed it will alst forever. As with
&gt;most back yard body persons of that time era they use it to fill holes (with
&gt;cardboard as backing) and dents (with out knocking it out first) therefor
&gt;Bondo became bad. Now get out you sandpaper and grinders and check out your
&gt;brand new, fresh off the show room floor vehicle and you will be surprised:)
&gt;Bondo requires proper drying time and should not be use in the rain (high
&gt;moisture), but when applied very thin (less than 1/16th of an inch) it dries
&gt;fast and will last. But do not let Bondo'd areas set for any period of time
&gt;because it does absorb moisture requiring drying out. (like overnight) put a
&gt;primer/sealer on it. Take the time and do the work, don't just fill and
&gt;paint. the closier to perfection the work is the less amount of Bondo
&gt;required. I am talking from over 30 years of body work with no repeats.


I my case the metal around a repair (if there was a rust hole there) would 
continue to rust and the bondo would begin to swell or simply fall out.
