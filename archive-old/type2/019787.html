&gt;  Bently is happy to tell you how to remove or install one, but
&gt; doesn't say how to tune one or what does what and why.

In the Bentley, start in  Fuel System, Chapter 3, pages 15 through 16, then go
to, Fuel System, Chapter 3,  pages 11 through 13. Other than a rebuild, which is
also in there, that should cover all of your carb adjustments.
