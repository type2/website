Subject: Where is the engine supposed to be?

So, I'm having some issues with my clutch cable breaking and it looks

like my bowden tube has a bit too much bend it in.  So, before I do 
anything, I wanted to get some advice on how far forward/back the 
engine/tranny are supposed to mounted.  I figure I can move it about an 
inch or so total but I wanted to check with everyone first.

I figure if I move the whole thing back, I'll have to readjust the 
following:
clutch cable
accelerator cable
heater cables

of course I would disconnect them *before* trying to move everything...

and I think that's it (please let me know if I missed something).  So, 
how to move it.  I figured I could put a jack underneath the junction of 
the tranny and the engine and lift it slightly.  Then I'd loosen the 2 
big bolts holding the tranny at the front, and the 4 bolts at the rear 
of the bus and try and shift the whole contraption back a little bit.

So, any thoughts on this before I do it.  I don't have a bentley in 
front of me so I haven't had a chance to take a look at it yet.  It 
would seem to make sense that the whole thing is a bit far forward 
because my accellerator cable hooks on kinda close to the cable and I 
have to screw on the clutch wing nut a ways before it's adjusted correctly.

Thanks!
Mike
