In answer to your query in early September 2000:

To fit a VW 1600 Type 2 Twin-port engine (or equivalent), to a 1973/74 VW 
1800 Type 2, you will need two large engine surround cover plates (one of 
the part numbers, is 211 118 515 A), the rear engine-support beam and 
associated chassis brackets, from a European specification 1972-79 VW 1600 
Type 2 (or possibly recent Brazilian spec.)

Some or all of these parts are still available new (the two cover plates 
together would cost about 100 pounds sterling!). I have for sale 
second-hand, one of the cover plates, the support beam and chassis brackets, 
but I suspect they would be prohibitively expensive, to ship these from 
Great Briain.

Regards.
