Subject: Easy power upgrade

Trying to make my van start I discovered that one of the plugs electrodes 
had all but disappeared ! The spark gap was about 10mm.

Replacing it has really cured the power problem I'd had for a while. Just 
shows how well I can run on three cylinders though.

My question is, what would cause this ?

For a picture, see my blog:

Thanks

Phil
