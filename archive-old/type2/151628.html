Subject: CV joints

Just repacked my passenger side CV joints. Read through the archives
and got conflicting information.

First, what do I torque the CV joint bolts to? Bentley says 25ft/lbs,
but others say 33ft/lbs and 35ft/lbs. I went with 30ft/lbs.

Second, only two of the 12 bolts on that side had a small lock washer.
Do I need to find 10 more of these? None of the CV bolts without a
washer were loose.
