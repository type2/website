&gt; Jan picked a cherry!  Check it out on pages 73 and 74 in &quot;The
&gt; Original  VW-bus&quot; book.  Sweet wheels Jan!  Tell us the story - how did
&gt; you find  that it was for sale?

Sheer luck, last Friday I noticed a small ad on a bus-page of a fellow
countryman. It had been there for 3 month already! The asking price was
fairly high. Meaning a lot of money but for this bus quite reasonable. I was
already considering a thorough restoration of my '78 de Luxe (which would
have cost more!) so I changed plans. The '78 will now go into storage for a
while.

Once I saw the ad I knew I had to get this bus ! Could not help myself.
