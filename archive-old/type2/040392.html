Subject: camping tent question

I have a setup somewhat like that. I got a 8 X 6 tarp and put 2 screws in 
the drain gutter on the side of the bus. Then I got some rope and tied the 
tarp from each end nice and tight around the screws, then I take 2 tent 
poles and put them on the other side of the tarp at each corner and tie a 
piece of rope to the poles at the top and secure it to the ground with tent 
pegs.

&gt;    I recently picked up a 9 x 13 screened gazebo.  It is great!  I set it 
&gt;up right next to the bus, put the picnic table in there, was having a grand 
&gt;old time. My question is.  Is there anyone out there that has had any 
&gt;success in &quot;rigging&quot; the tent so that it attaches directly to the bus?  
&gt;This has a zipper that zips down the middle. I would like to attach 
&gt;directly to the side.  Thanks for any help
