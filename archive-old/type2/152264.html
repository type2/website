Subject: Heater tubes, over the years

Here are some observations (and questions) about heater tubes:

We just bought a '77 Westy. It was missing the center heater tube (from
the the Y to the &quot;valves&quot; near the front) and also the electric fan in the
engine compartment.

The heater tube, or, hose, rotted and apparently fell out. I found a
non-westy '75 bay in a junkyard. It actually had a metal tube, instead of
the cruddy aluminum foil/cardboard junk. Of course, I snagged that, as
well as the electric fan, and installed it on our Westy.

So, the real question is: when/why did VW go from a nice metal tube to the
cruddy stuff? Was this a Westy thing, or a year thing?

Also, what is a good source for the small diameter cruddy stuff? I still
need to repair the run to the rear seat vent.

Thanks!

J
