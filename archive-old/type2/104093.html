Subject: Re:My bus is tired

Beth,
    I read about the problem with your bus.  Let me suggest something
to you.  Right there in NJ you have a valuable resource, it's called
The Bus Guild.  A club for owners of VW buses.  You can find them at
http://home.earthlink_dot_net/~rmaxon/_wsn/page2.html      Use the e-mail
link from that page to contact the club.  Who knows, maybe there is a
member living near you that can help you out in person.
