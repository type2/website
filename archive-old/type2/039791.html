Subject: Re: Oil type  (was: &lt;no subject&gt;

I run HD 30 in all my cars, no matter what.  My dad runs HD 20 in all his cars.
I had a ford that leaked oil terribly (well, it was a ford) and that's why I
used 30.  It's thicker.  Once I found 40 and used that.  I really wanted to put
gear oil in that sucker, but I couldn't find any at that moment.  This car also
ran on no oil.

    Yeah, HD 30 won't kill your bus.  Nothing will.  Don't let anyone tell you
different.  People laugh when I don't put oil with many numbers in my car.  I
laugh when those people buy brand name oil.

Rant rant rant, bitter bitter bitter.

&gt;     In reading the post about oil it just occurred to me that on my last oil
&gt; change, which was less than 20 miles ago, on the 77 westy, I put HD 30
&gt; Pennzoil oil in.
