Subject: right colour seat covers?

Dear List,
I have an orange 1973 Westy with the yellow cloth interior.
The front door panels are a tan colour.
I'm re-doing the seat covers and door panels and am confused by the
correct colour.
Is the &quot;tan&quot; or &quot;beige&quot; the correct one to order from Bus Depot?
Any help will be appreciated.
Thanks,
Tom Adams
