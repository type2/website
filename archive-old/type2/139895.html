&gt; I corrected my Dad with whom I debate &quot;issues&quot; often. He too mentioned that
&gt; Chrysler invented the mini-van and noticing my raised eyebrows he corrected
&gt; himself saying the first &quot;modern minivan&quot;... &lt;grin!&gt; Well if we were in
&gt; 1968 the 1968 VW van would be as modern as they come... That doesn't even
&gt; mention the numerous little Fiat people carriers. I often drove a Fiat
&gt; Panorama van in Italy. Imagine a 80% scale van of the VW version...

and that doesn't even take into consideration the Chevy (Corvan) and Ford
(original econoline) minivans of the 60's
&gt;
&gt; The older I get the less I like the marketing guys... For one there is a
&gt; whole portion of the population that takes their word as gospel and then
&gt; goes out the spread the misinformation.

any thing can be anything to a marketing guy/gal as long as it makes who
ever their being paid by look best.

&gt; FWIW I consider the magazine industry to be part of the marketing process.
&gt; They may review a product but they are about as impartial as the Pope is
&gt; about certain lifestyle topics... &lt;griN&gt;

some years ago (not sure if it is still around) there used to be an auto
mag sort of like Consumer Reports, it didn't accept advertising etc. and
it did call it like it saw em... there is still an auto show on TV from
Germany (DWTV auto or something) that I can occasionally get and it does
head to head comparisons of similar cars and ranks em 1st, 2nd, 3rd etc.

in Any case FWIW, Klick and Klack had a on line car choseing software
program and if you put in your driving habits etc they would tell you what
car was best for you.  I took the test a year or so ago and they sent back
saying that I should get an H1 hummer, but if I didn't have the money for
that I should consider (see bus content) getting a VW van..the best for me
after the original Hummer.

would love to see that software  ;8*}
