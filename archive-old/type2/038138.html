Subject: Re: engine movement, bumper color, turn signal problem

Friends,
As a &quot;back door&quot; member, I don't have access to your email addresses, so I'm 
communicating via the list with as much economy as possible.
On the engine movement, the rubber mounts may look good externally but that 
can be deceptive. If it shakes excessively and the bolts are tight, chances 
are the mounts are cracked in a way that you won't see until you remove 
them.
On bumper color, the white used in that mid-70's time frame was called 
&quot;Alpine White&quot; and you once were able to get spray cans of it from the 
FLVWPS. If not, most auto paint stores will mix up a quart to the original 
spec. Might as well preserve the authenticity!
On the turn signal, it of course sounds like a bad bulb, bad contact in the 
socket, or bad ground of the whole fixture at either the front or the rear. 
Take a look at the bulb brightnesses to see which end of the van is out of 
whack.
Thanks for the tip on Tacoma parts store, we're hitting the road soon to 
Canada and will keep it in mind, along with the list of A.I.R.S. members 
I've hard copied to give me confidence along the way.
By the way what is a &quot;hoover bit&quot; and should I have one?
