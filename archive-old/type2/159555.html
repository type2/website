Subject: removing catalytic converter from 77 bus

I wonder how much a 20 year old , first generation CAT is helping anyway  ?
and yes they do clog up, like putting a potato in your exhaust , it will  
idle but not rev up.
 
I think its better to remove it for his trip, he can always put it back on  
later when he comes back to the states,
 
thanks for your thoughts
