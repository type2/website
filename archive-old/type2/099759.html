Subject: Re: [T2] 1600 DP in a 73 Westy, how will it perform?

&gt;I've got someone that's interested in buying my 73 Westy but they have a
&gt;1600DP that they want to put in the bus rather than the 2.0 that I have with
&gt;it.  They are wondering though how the bus will do with that engine.

People like this will probably do it regardless of the answer to this question.  But to answer the question, the bus will &quot;do&quot; pretty much like a baywindow with a 1600DP engine (think 1971).  Heck, that was an awfully easy question.  I can't believe they even asked it.

&gt;Is the
&gt;transaxle that came in a 73 with a 17600 engine geared too high to use with
&gt;the 1600?  Did they keep the same gear ratios when they made the change from
&gt;the 1600 to the 1700?

Okay that's a better question and if I recall the answer is YES.  The gear ratios did not change significantly from 71 to 73.  74 was the first real change in baywindow gear ratios.
