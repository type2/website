Subject: Sticker Art...DONE! THANK YOU!!!

All,

Wow! Must be something in the air today....my first
post netted a measley 3 responses, but todays got so
many, that I lost count;-) I went from 0 e-mails in my
inbox, to 2.7Mb in less than 8 hours!!!!

I think I have the right combo of pics for my needs
now...an early 23-window splitty, '69 Westy poptop,
and an early Vanagon Single Cab! So...I figure that
pretty much covers everyone....splitty, loaf, Vanagon,
ragtop, camper and truck!!!! If you want more, I don't
know what to tell you...;-)

I should have a rough draft up tomorrow, and I will
post the URL when I do.

Many thanks to all who responded with photos and/or
encouragement. I sincerely appreciate it, as I was
about to abandon this project from lack of interest (I
guess I was just a *wee* bit wrong, there;-) 

Due to the fact that I was busy 'harvesting' and
editing photos all day, I wasn't able to write back to
everyone who responded, and I appologize. But you all
know who you are, and your efforts were certainly
helpful and appreciated. A special thanks to Shawn
Clark, who must have sent me at *least* 30
photos/links;-)

Thanks again, and look for the URL tomorrow (Thursday)!
