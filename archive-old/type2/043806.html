&gt; negotiation, if any.  The biggest concern I have is
&gt; that the Westy has an automatic transmission.  I
&gt; really want a 4-speed, but could accept the auto. if I
&gt; knew it was reliable and reasonably/affordably
&gt; reapaired or replaced. 

good news bad news,  the auto tranny is pretty solid in the later air
cooleds, it is not simple like the 4 speed and takes a little more
maintenance (fluid changes, check fluid etc) and should be a good solid
runner, if the tranny is now sound. 
 bad news, almost no one wants to work on em. and when they do it ain't
cheap.  They are also at least 100lbs heavier than the 4speed.

I have had a 78 with auto tranny (same as 81)for 8 years with mixed
results, when it runs right it runs fine, and when it doesn't it will
drive you to drink!

I wouldn't spend $5 on the bus unless you know that tranny is good.

drive it.

smooth level ground, firm accelerator, it should shift at about 15, and 35
MPH, the shifts should be so smooth that they are almost imperceptable
(esp 2-3)  s
smell the tranny fluid, should be purplish, not smelled burned (ignore if
synthetic, it is brownish purple and smells burned out of the can)
look at the dip stick in bright light, should have no metalic in the
fluid.

if you can drain the fluid and examine the filter, should have very little
metalic in it, no pieces and little sludge.

sorry don't know any places near Chicago, I'm in Maryland
