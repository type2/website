I have a few notes to add to this, as I have performed this on 3 Buses now.
Do not bother with the &quot;Heater Blower&quot; kits, they all are the same. You get
an Attwood Turbo 300 bilge blower, some tape and a switch. I get my blowers
from Marine supply houses (West Marine, Boat US, ect.) You install just like
he said, but with a few changes. First off, when you install the blower in
the tube, put some window screen mesh in front of the fan. There is crap,
rust scale and junk that will now be sucked/blown forward now due to all the
extra air flow (145 cfm). Next, you can use the wire from that non working
rear window defroster, and even use the switch if you want, but a headlight
switch out of a Dodge (70-80s) will work much better. You run the wire to
the dash light rheostat, this gives you complete control of the fan speed.
Most kits include a 2 or 3 speed switch, the Dodge switch is infinite.  The
Dodge switch is also very heavy duty and can handle the power, do not use a
VW switch, the wires are to small and you will smoke the switch. 
  You an install the blower in the long tube under the cargo floor, or up
front behind the &quot;skid plate&quot;, this provides a little more protection, but
also transfers a little more noise. Do not mount it solid, an old inner tube
to keep it isolated will help a lot. Local hardware stores also sell 3in
aluminum flex tubing that fits like a glove and will stretch about 4ft. 
  Lastly, there are 2 types of bilge blowers that I know of, the Attwood
3000 Turbo, and the Detmar. I prefer the Detmar, it has a higher output and
it is a little quieter. The inlet/outlets are the same size, but the Detmar
has a bigger fan. The middle is bulged up to fit it in. The price of both
blowers is around $25. The last one I got was an Attwood, I could not find a
Detmar locally. 
  These are a very good investment and will be a night and day difference in
your heating system. Of course you will want to completely check out your
system for leaks, cable operation, etc. All this is covered in the type 2
library and the archives. 
  A huge improvement in your heat can be made for around $30. Even a poor
guy like me can do this. And Peter is right, a sawsall is the best way to
go, but a hack saw will work too.

Hi all

I recently purchased a heater fan from J.C. Whitney.

Installation was pretty easy. I located it towards the very front
of the long heater tube under the bus. Some have cardboard
duct under your feet, but not my 71'. A power saw with a 
metal cutting blade cuts hack saw time by a bunch, but
I think a &quot;sawzall&quot; would be the perfect tool for cutting
the metal tube.

I also am pulling power from my defunct rear window
defroster. I would have liked to get to the fuse box, but
my hands are too big, my eyes are too old and my body
won't contort that way any more.

I discarded the original cover (asbestos lined?) and opted
for a combination or self-adhesive water pipe insulation,
nasa insulation and then a final layer of aluminum tape
to add strength and rigidity.

I did a quick test drive this evening and its miraculous.
My windshield defrosted before I even moved. Heat,
glorious heat, was being blown on my feet while I 
putzed along in our mild rush hour traffic here, going 
about 35 mph.

One downside: I noticed a slight glow from my GEN light.
Off it when I shut off the fan.
One other downside: Sounds like a Hoover vacuum. The
heater duct act as a sound tube. Turning up the stereo
a wee bit more seemed to work, though.

$78 and change delivered to my door, about another
$20 in insulation, install was accomplished over
a lazy weekend with beer. Could have been a one day
project easy if you really know what you're doing.

Well worth the investment in my opinion.

Pete
