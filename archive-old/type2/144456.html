&gt; is however another connection which is puzzling me. It connects to the

&gt; pedal). I followed it trough the frame right below the drivers seat,
&gt; into and across the front wheel well... and then it appears to go into
&gt; the cavity behind the front driver's side dogleg...... (&gt;&gt;&gt;?&lt;&lt;&lt;)

This is a vent hose to allow relatively clean and dry air into the front
of the booster when the vacuum pulls the diaphragm back.  Most cars don't
need this because the booster vent goes to the inside of the car or to
some other relatively clean area.  Just make sure that the hose is in
good shape and the bellows isn't cracked.  Mine was and has been duct
taped for many miles.  Not the best solution, but better than letting the
gunge into the booster.  Anybody sell a replacement bellows?
