Subject: bad coil?

Hi, I just put in a new coil. The Bosch Blue one, part #9 220 081 083 (0 
221 119 027).
Since I put it in, my tach. jumps around all over the place when the 
engine is under load,especially at higher rpms. With just straight 
cruising and not under load it's fine. In a couple of weeks I'll be 
going on a road trip and was wondering if anyone else has had that? I 
would like to get this resolved now instead of a breakdown somewhere in 
the middle of nowhere. Maybe I'm worried about it for nothing, but just 
want to make sure and maybe some suggestions of where to look.
1977 Westy, 2.0L FI engine.
Bernie, Fort Langley, B.C.
