&gt; Hey guys   I use to take the oil and battery out of my old bug and place 
&gt; them
&gt; behind the wood stove each night , then reinstall them in the morning .
&gt; Worked great it was a little more work but the car would start just fine 
&gt; and was
&gt; safer than building a fire under it. later and have fun  mark dearing
