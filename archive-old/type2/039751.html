Volks,
    In reading the post about oil it just occurred to me that on my last oil
change, which was less than 20 miles ago, on the 77 westy, I put HD 30
Pennzoil oil in.  Muir's book has a section regarding what type of oil I
should use but I overlooked it before doing the oil change.  I would imagine
that this oil is a better quality oil but I don't really know for sure.  My
question is will this negatively affect the performance of my engine or do I
have nothing to worry about, and is it too late to change the oil type that
is in there?  I intend to drive the bus to Alaska in a week so I am
depending on the engine to have no problems on the way there as the roads
are far from civilization.  I really didn't even think about this issue
until just now.  Any info would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance.
Dave
