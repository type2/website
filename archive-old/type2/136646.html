Subject: Re: [T2] ListServs and Pix

Volks,

Well, I am sorry to say that pictures are not going to happen.  This is
not just because they don't belong in e-mail (THEY DON'T!) but because
they are incredibley expensive to send.  The problem is that with a list,
you have to multiply the number of bits sent in by 1,000-1,500 to get the
number of bits sent out.  Multiply that by 30-50 posts per day and the
numbers get ridiculous very quickly.  One of our older members (David
Raistrick) used to have a .sig pushing &quot;the ASCII ribbon campaign&quot; and for
cost reasons, that is going to have to be it until they give out bandwidth
for free (which is not anywhere on the horizon)

This list is OLD![1]  It started up back in the days when the internet was
new and dial-up was the norm.  Today I'd bet that 30-60% of the members
have ADSL or cable bu as the recent posts show, there is still a fair
dial-up community out there.  Picture sites are readily available, if you
can put up with the pop-ups.  Most modern mail readers will render
well-formed URLs in text as links, even in an all-text message. If it's a
procedure, write up a web page and post a link to the page.

[1] I think we missed our ten-year aniversary, should have been held last
fall sometime.  Gerry Skerbitz, the man to blame for all of this started
the list some time in the fall of 1994.  I know I got on in January of '95
and the list was a going concenr by then.  TEN YEARS!!!  Damn... where did
the time go?
