Subject: Fridolin

The Fridolin has two distinct forms.
The German Post Office version (designed + built by VW themselves)  -
normally painted yellow.
The Swiss Post Office version (with additional work by Westfalia - inculding
&quot;Samba-style&quot; rear quarter windows) - painted yellow + white.

&gt;Subject: VW photos

&gt;I have VW photos on my www page.  These snaps were taken
&gt;a few years ago at the VW Classic car show, in California.

&gt;Anyone here have photos of the Fredolin(sp) vehicles?
&gt;Made by Westfalia for the German postal service (so I was
&gt;told).   There are photos of a yellow &amp; white one at:
