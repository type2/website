&gt;Can't say it's not possible. I can review the case and get back with
&gt;correction or confirmation.

Indeed, I screwed up royal. I have no personal experience with AVP engine
problems. The actual culprit in this case was ATK. They also sell VW motors
so be aware that ATK motors should be scrutinized very closely prior to
installation. See archives for mostly good reports on ATK.

My apologies to ATK and their outlets.

Sincerely,
