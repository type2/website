Subject: RE: New and looking

 Keep your  85 westy to drive, get the older bus to
play with till you get it fixed up, a 66 will keep you
busy for a while. Good luck finding a half decent
project bus, and rember do it right the first time and
you won't have to do it again. Be sure to get a Bently
book for the year bus that you get, makes life easy,
welcome to the list. Phil 72,75 bus,80 Westy(2-68 1-70
1-71 T-3's 1-73 T-4) and they all run wheeeew!!! My
wife says thats too many but I just ignore her...
