&gt;Jim,
&gt;How 'bout sketching some diagrams and layouts of your designs?
&gt;Better yet, take some photos, scan them and attach....

&gt;Ummm... fine except for the part about attaching photos.  If that isn't

&gt;your stuff, but please just make them available by anonymous FTP or put
&gt;them up on a web site.  Thanks!
