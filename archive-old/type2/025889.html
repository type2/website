Hi Volks,

OK, here's the situation:

When the bolt securing the fan broke off the crank on my '73 Dual-carb T4
motor last weekend, the flange the fan is bolted to beat the key and the
slot in the crank severely. No trace was found of the metal key that fits
between the crabkshaft and the flange.

No Problem, says I, I have a spare fan, flange, key and crankshaft in my
&quot;Other&quot; motor I bought from the wreckers last fall. Having repaired the
crank in my original motor, I now want to use the &quot;Other&quot; flange and key,
since they aren't so beat up. In fact, they're in quite good condition.

And so here's the query, oh mighty list-gurus:

How does one remove the key from the slot in the crank. My attempts with
vice-grips and screwdrivers have thus far failed to separate it from the
crankshaft as is desired. I haven't tried too hard as yet as I don't want to
break this part if I can help it. Dealers around these parts stock NOTHING
for aircooled VW's, you have a minimum 2-day wait until the parts are
shipped out from the warehouse.

As an alternative, could I re-mould the key from JB-Weld? Ie, lay a
bead/blob of JB-weld on the crank and file it into shape after it's
hardened? 

What about Loc-tite? It looks like the wrecker motor was put together with
loc-tite between the shaft and flange but there's no sign of it on my
original engine. Should there have been?

I don't have time &amp; funds to do a crank-up restoration on this engine right
now, I just need/want something reliable that will last about 3-4 months, at
which time I had planned to initiate a full tear-down and rebuild.

Thanks for your input,

Happy trails,
