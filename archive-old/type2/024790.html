&gt;      Hey There!
&gt;  My stick shift in the 73 Westy has always been a little difficult to =
&gt;  find 1st gear and downshifting into 2nd.
&gt;  Driving to work i was looking at the shift pattern placard on the ash =
&gt;  tray and noticed that the H is at a backwards slant.
&gt;  Tried to shift in this pattern and all seems smooth as silk.
&gt;  Obviously the bus was engineered to shift this way but having driven =
&gt;  other makes of standard cars the slanted H feels weird.
&gt;  Can anyone elaborate on this? Todd Hill?
&gt;  Thanks

Hi Phil,
In my oppinion and experience the H is straight forward and back the slant 
your are having to apply is probably due to wear in the mechanism. The most 
likely wear is in the guide plate at the base of the stick. Or it could 
simply be missalligned.

The picture on the ash tray is on a slant mearly to allow for the push down 
needed to engage reverse gear to be shown.

Good luck
