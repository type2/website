Subject: Cleaning the Headliner

------=_NextPart_001_0001_01C24C85.B055CE90

Hello all!

As I plan on having Tunes, the 1978 Bus I'm working on back Monday, I wan=
t to clean the Headliner. It has sat outside for about 3 years before I g=
ot it with a window slightly open. It appears to have mildew on the headl=
iner, but I'm not sure. It does not smell like that...It may just be dirt=
. The headliner is very good shape otherwise, and has not tears. So what =
is recommended for safely cleaning the headliner without having to remove=
 the whole thing (something I would rather not do)??

Thanks!

TJ, who really has to find someone around Miami that can do a nose job on=
 his bus....Get more from the Web.  FREE MSN Explorer download : http://e=
