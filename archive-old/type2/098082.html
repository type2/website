Subject: Re: [T2] VW Trends sales call?

&gt; I bet its not rates going up, I bet the magazine company is 
&gt; trying to make their subscription numbers look good for their 
&gt; fiscal year end report to shareholders.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Chris

Even more important than shareholders is the advertisers, whose rates are based 
on circulation. That's why they give such fantastic deals when you subscribe. 
The revenue from just the magazine sales isn't enough to keep a publication 
alive.
