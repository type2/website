Subject: Re: [T2] Mini skirts (3 beam balance)

I bought a 3 beam balance accurate to 0.1g about a year ago. Also bought a 
digital scale accurate to 1 g at the same time. Very inexpensive, made in 
China, and quality seems fine.

I was telling a guy in my shop class about the scale and he told me an 
interesting story:

Seems his brother had an outstanding traffic ticket. Cops came to his house 
with a warrant. He invited them inside where they noticed his 3 beam 
balance. They arrested him for drug paraphernalia possession, overnight in 
jail, bond posting, etc, etc. I forget all the details but I did go home and 
put the balance in a closet.

 I was just talking about a scale for home to weigh parts. Mailing off parts 
that are more closely matched in approximate weight rather than unknown 
weights would probably save a lot of time and money. For example the unknown 
piston that weighs 6g too much.

 Here's a few to consider:

 The Ohaus Scout 4000gx0.1g scale should do nicely, although one of those
 Sartorius analytical balances would certainly make you the Alpha Geek in
 the VW engine builder community.

 &quot;Why yes, my pistons _are_ balanced to one microgram!&quot;
