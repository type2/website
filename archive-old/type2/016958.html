Ray:

Sorry, but I didnt' save a copy of your original posting, but I think
you said that when you adjusted the bars, you'd unbolted the bearing
carrier from the spring plate.

If you did, and if you did not make careful note of its exact
positioning on the spring plate and put it back in the identical
position, then you may have munged up the rear wheel alignment.

In an extreme case, this could result in asking the CV joints to
function at an angle beyond their normal limits.
