Subject: 85 Vanogon Alt.

Fellow Listees,
Well it ended up being the brushes in the altenator, my dad and I gave
it the old &quot;HAMMER&quot; test and it failed so it got new brushes, it looks
all spiffy now the guy at the alt. shop scrubbed it CLEAN. and I think
he even does that 1 year warranty thingy, on his work all for like $70.
just thought I'd let you guys know.

Mike, 73 Westy
