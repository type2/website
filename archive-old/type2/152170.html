&gt; &lt;&lt;is there a list like this one for squarebacks?&gt;&gt;
&gt; Crazy thing you brought this up, and while it's of the beaten path from
&gt; the Type 2's I've been thinking about looking for a squareback.
&gt;
&gt; My question is for anyone that knows--( I sure don't )
&gt;
&gt; What kind of engine is in these things?
&gt; Pancake, suitcase type, or???

a type 3 engine of course. not sure what it is called by most folks I just
called it a flat beetle engine...put one in a bus many many many years
ago......
