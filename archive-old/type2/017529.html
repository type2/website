Again this year, I am in charge of the pages for two southeast bus events. 
The pages have been updated with this year's info. Both of these events are 
well attended and a great time for all.

This one has new links to pics and directions.

Really the same old page with the new dates for this year. Will do more 
changes before this fall.
