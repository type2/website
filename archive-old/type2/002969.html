Hey list,=20

    Does anyone know where i can get a new or near mint front seats for =
a 74 bus.  I would prefer the kind with headrests but it isn't =
necessary.  I have checked the main suppliers that i know of and they =
are prettty pricy, If anyone knows where to get some a bit cheaper =
please let me know.  Thank you
