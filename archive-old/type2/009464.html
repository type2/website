Buses with the body off are actually still very strong, The wineries near 
here take a van and cut the bodies open or off so that the floor is easy to 
access. Some have done this with the old buses as they don't need coolant 
and the redux boxes are like a tractor, then they drive them to load up a 
pile of grapes, then park it at the side of the road to sell the grapes.
I picked up one of these for the redux trans as the rest was hacked off in 
the 70's
I have a 78 here right now that has only the floor left! I am going to make 
a Christmas Parade float
I hate the Dreams i have,,,
