&gt;I've been using this setup on my 1800 T4 for about 4 years with no 
&gt;problems.  The dense cotton disk has become oil soaked but there's been 
&gt;no evidence of oil leakage.

Are there different styles of VDO oil temp senders?  I am thinking about
adding temp gauges.  When I asked the guy at Cal Imports what I needed,
he described a set up that would use a doubler at the oil pressure warning
light sender to attach an oil temp sender and the oil pressure sender to the
same hole in the crankcase.  Does this sound right?  Is the dipstick oil temp
sender better?
