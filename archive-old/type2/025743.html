Dave Wolfanger says about Flux Core Arc Welders:

&gt; Adequate for tinkering- if that's all you ever want to do....
&gt; However, once you start welding, the projects escalate very rapidly,
&gt; and a toy welder is not going to do it. the gasless mig makes big splatter,
&gt; nasty unprofessional welds, and requires the flux-core wire in expensive small
&gt; spools. Go to a local welding supply where they sell equipment and ask for
&gt; a demonstration ( they will let you try the machine) . you will soon see the
&gt; difference.
&gt; You don't need 220v. equipment for bus projects, and it isn't very portable.
&gt; Try 110 v. welders, with and without inert gas.Thank the man, and then go buy
&gt; it
&gt; at Harbor Freight .

Then remember where the welding supply place is. You will need Argon, wire,
gloves...lots of consumables...and the best place to get it (sometimes the
only place--they don't have argon at Home Depot) is the welding shop.
