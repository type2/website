Subject: Re: [T2] advice on running hot.

Bob,

Had both the muffler shield between the muffler and the lower engine 
tin...and....the cute little one that screws on to the bumper...you can 
see it(sort of) here.

I had to remove the bumper shield in order to get Jamie Rivers hitch on, 
but still have it as one of the local salvage yard guys told me they were 
worth $75.00!

The bumper still gets *really* hot!...but the inside engine tin and parts 
are still comfy cool.

I've been thinking about trying to move my heat dump pipes around a little 
bit and see if that helps....although that muffler sure radiates a lot of 
heat...*right there, right now*

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; My 78 runs lots lower on oil temps, but the bumper and rear are awesomely
&gt; &gt; hot.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 30 minute run on the interstate at 75-80 and I can't even touch the
&gt; &gt; bumper, while oil temps are about 210F
&gt; 
 do you have the bumper heat guard there between the muffler and the
 bumper, (I can count on one hand the number I've actually seen installed,
 and have left over fingers)
   if not it isn't the bus engine that is running hot but just radiated
 muffler heat, perfectly normal...
