&gt;I'll go ahead and go on the record
&gt;telling the whole world that I'm now driving a bus with an engine repaired
&gt;with JBWeld.

I also am using JPWeld :-)

I striped #1 spark plug about a year ago, I got it fixed with a insert.
But about 2 months ago I striped the insert!!!  As Mary is my every day 
ride,
I figured I would try JBWeld until I could do a more permanent repair.
Well it held for about 2 weeks :-) So I tried it again, again lasted 
about 2 weeks!
So now about every 2 weeks I JBweld in my plug!
