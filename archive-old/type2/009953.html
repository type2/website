&gt;I called my insurance agent and she said
&gt;nobody she deals with will insure it!  All I'm
&gt;looking for on the bus is liability. I told her it is an RV, since
&gt;that is how I'd register it, but it apparently doesn't qualify
&gt;since it doesn't have its own heat/a/c units &amp; enclosed toilet.
&gt;I asked if it were simply a van, would it work, she said no, since
&gt;you told me it is an RV, PLUS, no one wants to insure a 22 year old
&gt;van. ????.  I know, I need a new insurance agent, but they are so cheap
&gt;on my car. Has anybody had this problem?
&gt;

I am having a hard time understanding your &quot;agent&quot;. All you want is 
liability...PL/PD. This means the car etc. you hit is covered. Your vehicle 
is not covered. You are not buying insurance on your bus. It doesn't matter 
if it's 10 years old, 20, 30....big deal...you are not insuring the bus/RV 
whatever. Does your &quot;agent&quot; not understand this????
