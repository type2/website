Subject: Distributor...backwards

I was changing the points, cap, rotor, wires, etc in our '65 panel, and
came across something very strange. (Keep in mind we have only had this
since Feb, and now that other restoration is done, I am messing with the
engine)

The distributor is 180 degress off. That messed me up for a hour or so.
After I replaced everything, it just would not run. When I removed the old
cap and wired, I didn't pay attention to where everything was. I know well
what wire should go where.

But, it wouldn't start. I troubleshooted everything, and finally
discovered the distributor was 180 off. It should have tipped me off with
the condensor mounted on the rear of the dist (rear is rear). But, when I
looked for the cyl. 1 notch, it was towards the left front of the bus.
Grrr.

It's been awhile since I've had a distributor out of an engine, but I
thought I remember that it can only go in one way. I also remember that
Type IIIs have the distributor mounted &quot;wrong&quot;.

Once I figured this out, I moved the wires, and it fired right up. In all
the T2s I have seen, this is the first time I've encountered this type of
hack (mistake???).

I also found that all the plugs were gapped to about .35 or so. They are
in good condition, so I regapped them.

Timing is spot on, even with the dist. 180 degress off.

With the carb. rebuild I did, it now runs better than ever.

Any comments on this wierdness?

Jon
