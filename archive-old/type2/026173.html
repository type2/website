I'm in the midst of having a 78X88 built which works out to 1900cc.  My
engine builder, who does a lot of Berg engines, recommends thick walled 88s
(machine in) for maximum cooling.  Anything larger (P/Cs) would require an
external oil cooler.  I told him I want to go up hills in 4th gear so he
recommended single port heads with dual Kadrons which he says will draw
better and create more torque (for going up hills) than dual intake.

&gt; 
&gt;  In one of his technical articles, he talks about a stroker motor with
&gt; stock length rods making more torque, in direct reference to buses and
&gt; the extra weight.  Is this common to run strokers in buses?  I've seen
&gt; plenty of Cal Look bugs with fat motors like that, but what are the
&gt; ramifications
&gt; of a stroker in a bus?  Are there more over-heating problems? Would it
&gt; require dual carbs?  The smallest stroker motor I've seen was a 2017,
&gt; and that seems like a lot of engine for a bus.
