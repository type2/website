Hello all,

I just   purchased a 1978 westy. The odometer says 54,000. miles. The
seller said he thought that was correct but was not the 1st or 2nd or... 
well you know . But the bus itself is is pretty good shape. It has some
rust but runs strong. Its  first home was in Calif. now living in
Florida. 
My questions are 1. What are some of the things that might give me a clue
as to the correct milage?
		2. Were the Calif. smogged engines any worse than their 49 state
counter parts? 

BTW I own a locksmith business
