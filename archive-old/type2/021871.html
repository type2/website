Subject: Re: [T2] Oil cooler lines

George, Stan:
I'd second George's reasoning on this.
I believe the 911's cooler is on the scavenge side, so would not effect the
pressure on the supply side.
(Actually, I have one of these setups in one of my vast piles of GOOD STUFF,
waiting for the day I put a killer type 4 engine in my 67 912! I could look at
it  for someone's information if it would be helpful.)
Understand that the DM way that Porsche did this entailed about $1500 worth of
nice German hardware. Only 2 of the 20 or so type 2's I have owned cost more IN
TOTAL  than this oil cooler setup. I really have to question (along with Dr.
Tim) whether any of this is even necessary unless you are running 103mm big
bores!

&gt; IN general, you want to keep the lines short, as the longer they are the
&gt; more pressure loss you will get and therefore the less flow.
&gt;
&gt; That being said, if you do have to run long lines they have to be larger
&gt; in diameter.  I'm not familiar with the Porsche setup, but I'll bet they
&gt; either run large metal lines, or use us bypass cooler setup so that the
&gt; pressure to the bearings would not be lessened.  Metal lines would be
&gt; preferable as they would dump some heat themseleves and be less prone to
&gt; deterioration.
&gt;
&gt; On cooler placement, don't assume that a location will provide airflow.
&gt; The eddys and currents around a moving bus are hard to predict!  You're
&gt; better off to provide postive airflow with a fan, along with some sort of
&gt; duct to prevent hot air recirculation.  The hot air exhaust should be
&gt; several feet from the inlet.
&gt;
&gt; Speculation session:
&gt;
&gt; The best oil cooling setup would simply take oil from the sump, run it
&gt; through a cooler, and return it to the sump.  This would entail another
&gt; oil pump or perhaps a dual pump as installed in the autostick bug.  This
&gt; way the bearings would not have the restriction of the cooler in the
&gt; path and would always see full pressure.
