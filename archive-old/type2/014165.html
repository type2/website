Subject: Re: [[T2] cabinet install questions]

Joel,
a 3/4 zbed was in the original 78 westy, but a full length stock westy zb=
ed
(like from a std westy with no icebox/fridge cab) shouldn't stick out tow=
ards
the front of the bus any further than a 3/4 length.
Fully extended, the bed should bump right up against the sink cab, if it =
is
flush with the bulkhead behind the driver's seat.
Is your zbed from the same era of westy conversion?

this past weekend i acquired a sink/spare tire cabinet from a 78 westy pa=

bus (the one that sits on the driver's side wall) the icebox portion of
the cabinet has been removed.

from what i can tell from eye-balling it, it doesnt look like i can put m=

z-bed fully down with this cabinet in the bus.

so, is the only z-bed that will work with this cabinet the one from the s=

setup? (i think that would be a 3/4 width z-bed, but not sure)

thanks.
