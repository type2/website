Subject: 79 Westy FS in Wisconsin

Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt;      I have decided that I do not have the time for 2 buses, and in order 
to 
&gt; focus more on our 69 (my first &quot;love&quot;- lol ), we have decided to put our 79 
&gt; up for sale.
&gt;      I bought the westy almost 2 years ago, and during that time have done 
&gt; almost nothing to it, except acquire parts and stuff for it. I simply never 
&gt; seem to have time for it. 
&gt; 
&gt;      I will describe it the best that I can here.......
&gt; 
&gt;      INTERIOR:   Better than most.  Inside was redone at some point in the 
&gt; not too distant past.  Has newer wood panels.  All camping stuff present, 
and 
&gt; everything works except for the fridge. Has correct child's cot, stool, 
both 
&gt; front and rear tables, rear bug screen.  Fabric on Z bed and upper bunk in 
&gt; very good shape with no rips. Decent carpet.  Front seats could be redone, 
&gt; though. Good screens on louvered side windows.  Poptop canvas has a tear in 
&gt; one side, I think PO got it caught in the hinge for the poptop.  He did 
sort 
&gt; of a patch job on it, so it is functional, but could be replaced somewhere 
in 
&gt; the future. Cabinets and drawers in above average shape. All curtains, 
&gt; including the front curtain, are there.
&gt; 
&gt;      EXTERIOR:  Some rust in the usual spots that most bays have.  Overall, 
&gt; the floors are in good shape, but there is some rust in the lower rockers, 
&gt; also bottom corner of sliding door, minor rust in battery tray, etc.  All 
of 
&gt; this is fixable, or drive as is.  Both pans underneath- the belly pan, and 
&gt; the &quot;pedal&quot; pan, are present, a rarity in a bus. Frame good. Bumpers are 
OK, 
&gt; but could use a repaint. All glass good.  All seals are OK except hatch 
seal 
&gt; has minor leak. Bus is stored in garage, so I never made it a priority to 
&gt; replace it. One key fits ignition and all doors except hatch lock has 
&gt; separate key. There is some rust in the rain gutter too, but no holes.
&gt; 
&gt;       MECHANICAL:    2.0L FI motor, 4 speed manual trans.   
&gt;                                Motor runs fairly smooth with good power.  
The 
&gt; idle is high, due to a vacuum leak somewhere, also needs a tune up (have 
&gt; parts, more on that later). Trans has a little slop in the shifter, very 
&gt; driveable, does NOT pop out of gear or anything, just could use shifter 
&gt; bushings. Has good brakes, parking brake works too. Has newer Goodyears all 
&gt; around.  Exhaust a little loud, needs heater box replaced on one side(have 
&gt; part), other side and muffler are new.  Drives down the road straight and 
&gt; stops straight. I would also replace the rear shocks if I were keeping it. 
&gt; Fuel gauge is dead, problem is gauge itself (have part). Needs cooling tin 
&gt; installed (have parts)
&gt; 
&gt;       SPARE PARTS to go with bus.  (Please don't ask me to separate, 
&gt; everything goes with the bus)
&gt; 
&gt;         Tune up parts- Have new plugs, wires, and NEW complete distributor 
in 
&gt; the box. Just needs to be installed. 
&gt;          Have new heat exchanger for the side that needs it- purchased from 
&gt; Bus Depot. 
&gt;         Includes the missing tin, just needs installation.
&gt;         Have good used fuel gauge that needs to be installed in the dash.
&gt;          Also have complete extra set of curtains, including extra front 
&gt; curtain that is ike new.  Have an extra rod for the sliding door, too, also 
&gt; some spare tiebacks.
&gt;         Have extra front table leg too.
&gt;          Have 2 extra canvas's for the child's cot, 1 of which is brand 
new. 
&gt;          Also have a plethora of used extra parts....have extra glass, 
extra 
&gt; door latches,  some inside panels, extra wheels, bumpers, taillight lenses, 
&gt; extra FI setup, spare hatch and decklid, and much more. 
&gt;        Will include extra gas tank.
&gt;        Also still have parts bus here, should there be anything that you 
&gt; would want off of it.
&gt;        And, the best part-  Also included is a spare 2.0 L motor, complete 
minus fuel system, with good heater boxes on that one 
&gt; too. 
&gt;          
&gt; 
&gt;     I am sure I  am forgetting stuff.  Any questions just ask.  
&gt;     
&gt;     To sum all of this up.....if you are looking for a westy and have time/ 
&gt; know how to do the few things it needs- most of the parts are included, you 
&gt; could end up with a good daily driver out of the deal. 
&gt;     
&gt; 
&gt;    Selling price.......$ 2500 FIRM for all.
&gt; 
Located in Appleton, Wi.

  Thanks for your time,
 Brian
