&gt; Let me start by saying, I hate Homeowner Associations.

David didn't mention any HOA.  Even so, if the HOA doesn't control *the 
street*, then its rules would not apply to David.

Suburban HOAs are quite often different from urban HOAs.

It's true that in a suburban HOA, the rules might govern the street.  
That's because the subdivision is really a single development and 
resold under the same CC&amp;Rs.

I am applying experience from San Francisco, here... in cities like SF 
and Boston, you are likely to have several small apartment / condo 
buildings on a single block.  Each of these has their own sets of 
rules, but in each case, their domain ends at the curb (they can 
generally govern what happens on the sidewalk, e.g. in planter boxes 
around trees and the like, because the property owner is responsible 
for sidewalk maintenance).

 &gt; At least here in Miami, condo associations take
&gt; extreme measures when it comes to eyesores.

I'm sure they can govern what happens in their own parking garage, and, 
like a suburban HOA, on the street if the street is part of the 
subdivision itself.  But what if there are multiple, non-related 
buildings on a block?  You are certainly not subject to your 
neighboring buildings' CC&amp;Rs.

I'm willing to bet that David is subject only to city ordinances in 
this case.  If it were me, I would call the police, and discuss the 
situation with the officer who responds to the call.  Ask them to 
clarify the law for you.
