Hey Volks,

I just wanted to say thanks to all for your great volume of information.  I 
finally got my 74 Sportsmobile up to speed with everyone's help and just got 
back from my first long trip with her.  We went from Omaha to Chicago and 
Alpine Valley, Wisconsin and back and she didn't miss a beat.  Plus, she was 
getting about 19-20 mpg - whatta girl.  

Anyway, since returning, she has started backfiring whenever I let off the 
accelerator to just slow down in traffic, but she is still running strong.  
What could be causing this???  Any suggestions appreciated - thanks.

PS  The Phishin was phantastic also.
