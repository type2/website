&gt;i just got a set of dual weber idf 40, wow what a nice setup, i got them
&gt;from a previous 2L type 4 owner, so i thought all jet was ok ! well no :(
&gt;
&gt;Im looking to go F7 emulsion, 185 air and 135 main jet ... (4 x venturi =
&gt;132=135 main jet by the book)

Hmmm... I get 32x4=128 so 130 mains would seem to be appropriate.

&gt;I wish i could get better gas mileage too

Don't we all!  Get the carbs tuned properly and your mileage will increase.


&gt;Anyone has these jet they are willing to sell me ? is my setup okay ?

CB Performance should have them.  http://www.cbperformance_dot_com/
