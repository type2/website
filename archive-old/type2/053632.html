Landon and Karen,

Sounds like your fuel pump.  Its attached to the case with two socket or 
&quot;allen&quot; head bolts.  You can remove the pump pretty easily and it can be 
disassembled and rebuilt with not much more than a flat screwdriver.  If you 
can't find a rebuild kit, you might get it working again with a good 
cleaning.  

Its held together by about 10 screws.  It does have an internal filter that 
is removed by by unscrewing a &quot;plug&quot; screw on the side of the pump above the 
diaphragm. (not sure what size wrench, a small adjustable should do it.)

Be VERY careful about replacing it with an aftermarket electric pump.  You 
not only need the pump, but you may also need a pressure regulator to get the 
correct fuel pressure to your carbs.

You will need to run wiring, fuse it and you should also install a relay of 
some kind so that the pump will only run when the engine is running.  
Otherwise, if you were ever involved in a collision that ruptured a fuel 
line, the electric pump would continue to run and pump gas out the broken 
line until the key was turned off.  (Not a safe situation)

Some electric pumps are also very noisy.

A PO had done this to my 74.  I yanked the whole works and installed a used 
stock fuel pump that I cleaned up a bit.  IMHO, MUCH simpler, more dependable 
and &quot;glitch&quot; resistant.
