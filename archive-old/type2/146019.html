Subject: Re: [T2] Heating

&lt;My old '71 used a homemade air recycler (cabin air was sent thru' the heat
exchangers over and over) it got hot in there... I'm up for a system that could be used on later engines... ?-)&gt;

That will be my goal I think after I decide if the stock Corvair system is good or not. My Corvair friends say yes it is good though it is a stale air system like the 50's and early 60's VW systems. 

I may adapt the VW style heater boxes with a booster fan to the Corvair exhaust. 

Dunno. Still working on the design. 

Busy weekend: worked on the VW ingition switch for my friend, worked on a Dodge Caravan for another friend, fixed an electric fence and horse trailer lights for a different friend, fixed our vaccum cleaner, fixed our VW Cabrio's a/c system which was not draining, cleaned the Cabrio's carpet, add Cabrio splashguards, and so on. 

Anxious to finish all these other little projects so I can work on the Corvair. This week is shelving and wireless dog fence. 

Chris
