Subject: No Start 

Hello all,

I'm back after a long time off the list.  I graduated with my masters
and have promptly screwed up my bus.

I left the lights on the other day and had a friend jump start me.  No
problem.

When I got home I decided to disconnect the voltage regulator thinking
that this would cause the alternator to operate at maximum and recharge
my battery more quickly.  As the engine started to die after I
disconnected the regulator I reconnected it at which point the engine
ran very very slowly for about ten seconds.  I'm sure many of you are
laughing by now and saying what an idiot.

Anyway, after that I tried to start it and the battery was so low that
it wouldn't turn the engine over completely.

The next day I tried to push start it several times with no luck.  I
then tried to jump it again and got the battery charged enough that the
starter turned freely but no start.

Since then I've trickle charged the battery but the thing won't start.

I checked the fuel pump and it's working fine.  There is a spark at the
coil and the plugs but it doesn't seem to be all that impressive??  I
have a Pertronix Electronic Ignition kit that is coupled with their
Flame Thrower Coil.

In the past I've had intermittent trouble with the bus occasionally not
starting.  I usually wait a few minutes and try it again and it starts.
I was never able to determine the cause of this and it resembles the
problem that I have now but no matter what I do I can't get it to start.

Does anyone have any ideas??  I'm at a loss... where should I start
troubleshooting??

Sorry for the length.  Any advice (outside of comments about my
stupidity) will be greatly appreciated.

Jason
