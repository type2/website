Subject: Re: [T2] dizzy-shaft lube/points oxidizing

Hiya Tommy,

The stuff you need for lubricating the points block/distributor cam is Bosch 
Ft1v4.  It's a wax based lubricant especially designed by Bosch for just this 
purpose.  Even has a picture of a little distributor on the tube.

AND...........since you are in Portland, drop by Discount Import Parts.  They 
have the stuff on their shelves.
