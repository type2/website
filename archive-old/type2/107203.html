Subject: 73 Front End rebuilt

Hey guys,

With all this tire talk I have decided to rebuild my front end.  So now I 
am looking for advice, hints and procedures.

I have a 73 Camper, with 73K, who's rubber bits are shot and there is lots 
of play in the joints.  Back when I had a 72 was planning to dot the same
 thing but the body gave out before I could use the parts.

So here is what I am going to do.
Replace inner and outer bearings.
Tie rods and ends
steering damper
Swap rebuilt torsion arms from 72.
Shocks
Replace disks as needed
Replace pads
Torsion bar pads and clips

And there may be some other bit.
While I am there replace horn wires.

Immediate Questions:
Should I expect to replace the needle bearings?
Should I do the steering box now too?
Can I reuse the torsion bar?
Other critical thing I should do?

My goal here is to rebuild the front suspension and create an article with 
procedures and picture for this.  I have already read the current articles 
but found them lacking for what I am about to under take. 

Any useful advice would be appreciated.

Thanks
Steve
