Hello all.  I have a 73 Contempo High Top bus that I purchased for
restoration.  I am under some financial hardships and would like to sell it
for what I paid ($1000).  It has a new rebuilt motor that is currently out
of it.  The PO had problems with the motor (could not get the dual solexes
to work so he gave up).  I pulled out the motor to go over it and reseal.
So far the heads and cylinders are off.  I have the receipts for a recent
full rebuild and confirmed it by looking at the rings, cylinder bores and
brand new heads.  All you need to is reassemble and make a decent profit or
simply enjoy it.  I do not have time and really need the money.  It is
really cute with a blue and white paint scheme.  Interior is decent, dash is
great, front seats could use recover, no exterior rust with original paint
(area around windshield is perfect too : ) ).  Come take a look in North San
Diego County.  I will even tow it to you locally for $35 (the price to rent
the tow dolly).
  
Justin
