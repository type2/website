Subject: Re: i got a 74 westy

&gt;Hello all,
&gt; I am finally got a bus again. I picked up a 74 westy from a friend . It has
&gt;a nice interior, This is the first post 72 bus ive ever owned. It has an
&gt;interior I am not familiar to.  I believe it is missing the stove and I am
&gt;in search of the blue/green plaid upholstery for the front seats. Any one
&gt;have these? Are there any sites out there where I can see pictures of the
&gt;interiors of these westys? I looked on thesamba and didn't see any thing.
&gt; Later ,
&gt; Bryan
