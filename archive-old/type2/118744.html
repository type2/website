Subject: 12 V - 400 W Inverter

So I just got a pretty good deal on a 400 Watt 12 volt inverter.  So,  what
can I power with 400 watts?  Is there some sort of kit to install a 2nd
battery?  As I recall - I looked at inverters last summer but then I looked at
what I could power with it and there did not seem to be much - but now I
notice an in-law has an inverter in his truck and he powers a printer and
lap-top - what else is available?

And .... the ice box in my 78 is pretty much a waste of time.  I was thinking
about getting a new cover for it from another bus and cutting a hole in it -
and fastening on the cooling unit from a 12 volt fridge and saving my original
piece of interior to put back on if ever necessary.  Anyone ever hear of
anything like that - converting an ice box into a 12 volt fridge?
