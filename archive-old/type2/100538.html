Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Depot Now Hiring

&gt;&gt;who just rattle-canned his rear deck area and halfway up the walls and the 
&gt;&gt;engine hatch too. 20/20 rules in effect.

Oh, the horror, how could this happen, tragic poor bus.......

*writing this on my laptop over wireless network in my bus...the whole bus 
was rattle canned*

I think it'd be a ball to work for the Bus Depot, wonder if they would throw 
in relocation compensation and free parts into the deal.
