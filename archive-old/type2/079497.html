Subject: Paint question...

Oh Great and All Knowing List;
   I have a question regarding removing paint. The vehicle in question
is my daily driver '69 Bug, but I'm sure answers would apply to many
busses, including mine which has a pretty crappy shaker can paint job.
But it's not running right now and the Bug is.
   Anyhow, making a long story as short as possible, somewhere in its
past some doofus decided to repaint it a non original color and did a
sorry job of it. (Paint on the fender welting was an early indication.)
There seems to be some sort of base coat (white) and then a pretty yukky
bluish/silvery color top coat. Preparation must have been lousy, because
chunks of it peel off under the pressure of a car wash hose.
   (Now don't tell me to take my cookie jar of quarters to the car wash,
it just comes off here and there and I've used a 3500 psi pressure
washer on it as well.)
   What I'm wondering is if a product like Citrus Strip would work? I
use it when refinishing furniture and it works well, doesn't stink up
the place and is relatively non-toxic.
   Any other ideas? Am I doomed to spend hours sanding like a maniac? Am
I nuts? (Probably, but that's another subject.)

Eagerly awaiting your wisdom:
