Subject: Petronix &quot;gap&quot;

Hello all

I have had a Petronix ignition in my bus for the past month or so. I set the
gap with the little plastic piece that came with the kit. When I set the
timing and checked the dwell it sits steady at 42 degrees. I know this is at
the bottom of the recomended dwell settings for used points. I am wondering
what others with the Petronix ignition have set the module gap at? Has any
body tried different gaps and seen any improvement?

Thanks
Jasan C.
