walt,
my first guess would be pushrod tubes, notorious for
leaking as anyone on the list can attest to.   i would
go underneath the bus and take the tin off each side. 
its the tin directly under the head, should be just a
couple screws.   take the bus for a cruise around the
block so its warmed up, climb back under and watch
where the oil is comin from, odds are pushrod tube
seals.   as for spray washing the underside, should be
ok, because the tin should protect the engine
compartment, just dont go crazy with it.   might want
to try some simple green sprayed on a nice warm motor
before cleaning.   just my $.02

&gt; Hello Type 2 List:
&gt; 
&gt; My recently acquired '76 Campmobile has a serious
&gt; case of oil drip.  I 
&gt; adopted this rig from a good friend and told him I'd
&gt; give it a good home.
&gt; 
&gt; After adjusting the valves this weekend I put on new
&gt; valve cover gaskets but 
&gt; I really don't think they have contributed to the
&gt; problem. I also don't 
&gt; believe it's coming from the oil filter area.
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions on how to troubleshoot and search
&gt; for the specific 
&gt; location(s) of the leak?  Supposedly, the engine is
&gt; a rebuilt unit with 
&gt; about 20k miles on it.  Is it possible to go to the
&gt; spray wash and clean off 
&gt; the bottom of the engine without flooding things in
&gt; the engine compartment?  
&gt; Any help is appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks and best regards,
&gt; Walt
&gt; '76 Campmobile
