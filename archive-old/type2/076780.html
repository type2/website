Subject: Re: [T2] Buying Help '73

You hit the button on those things, Chris.
The best thing to do if you can is take it to a
trustworthy VW specialist &amp; have them put it on a
hoist and do the whole check.
It cost me about $120 here in Australia.
Often the Automobile Association does similar
services.
My own check to add is the windscreen seal &amp; front
skirt.
If it looks dodgy you may be in LOTS of trouble.
Cheers And Happy Hunting
Andrew Wood

&gt; Look at rust and collision damage. They make small
&gt; magnets to test for rust 
&gt; on car bodies. Check with an Auto Body suppl;y
&gt; store. Not expensive.
&gt; 
&gt; Some rust is acceptable because it is easy to fix
&gt; BUT is it easy for YOU to 
&gt; fix. You don't want seam and frame rust. Harder to
&gt; fix.
&gt; 
&gt; I would be content to know where the rust is so at
&gt; least there are no 
&gt; surprises later.
&gt; 
&gt; Another method is knocking with your knuckles.
&gt; 
&gt; All else can be fixed - some expensive but it can be
&gt; fixed.
&gt; 
&gt; Muir has a good chapter on buying a VW. Get out your
&gt; Muir and Bentley and 
&gt; look at the pics so you know how things should look
&gt; and you know how all 
&gt; the controls work.
&gt; 
&gt; Look for missing stuff (accessories). Headliner
&gt; decent?
&gt; 
&gt; Pull up all the mats and carpets that will come up.
&gt; Anything wet? Rust?
&gt; 
&gt; Will he allow you to wet the car down to look for
&gt; big leaks?
&gt; 
&gt; Check the roof - any CB antenna holes?
&gt; 
&gt; Drive it on the highway and in town.
&gt; 
&gt; Smell the oil for gas.
&gt; 
&gt; See what maintenance is needing to be done. If he
&gt; was sloppy this time, he 
&gt; has been sloppy all the time. Figure this is best
&gt; this bus has looked in a 
&gt; long time, people clean up stuff before they sell
&gt; it.
&gt; 
&gt; Ask why he is selling it.
&gt; 
&gt; Check for a loose front end - on and off the jacks.
&gt; 
&gt; Look under the battery. Rust?
&gt; 
&gt; How many taped together wiring connections? Fire
&gt; hazard?
&gt; 
&gt; Windshield wipers work?
&gt; 
&gt; Lights all work? if not why? Missing wiring,
&gt; corrosion, cut wires? I bought 
&gt; my first car ('66 Mustang) and they were having
&gt; wiring troubles. To isolate 
&gt; the problem the PO cut ALL of the wires to each of
&gt; he exterior and interior 
&gt; lights. They twisted the headlight wires back
&gt; together and taped them. No 
&gt; brake lights, no reverse lights, etc. I did not
&gt; notice 'til much later (Home).
&gt; 
&gt; Does the vehicle sit level? All busses sag a bit in
&gt; the back, but I mean 
&gt; left to right.
&gt; 
&gt; Windows all open and close properly?
&gt; 
&gt; Lock work? Inside and out?
&gt; 
&gt; Any homemade repairs? Incorrect carburetors or
&gt; ignition? Muffler decent? 
&gt; Heater's in fair to good condition?
&gt; 
&gt; Condition of the fuel system? Any fuel leaks?
&gt; 
&gt; Check out the heat. Levers work.
&gt; 
&gt; Feel the bottom panels and the bottom of the doors.
&gt; 
&gt; Check out the radio but test the car without the
&gt; radio so you can hear the 
&gt; car.
&gt; 
&gt; When you first arrive and first look at the engine,
&gt; feel to see if it is 
&gt; warm. Did he pre-start the engine or is it cold? If
&gt; it is warm it may have 
&gt; a dead battery he was trying to charge, hard start
&gt; problem, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; When you leave if you bought it - ask for all the
&gt; papers and books and 
&gt; spares he has. He might forget some.

&gt; &gt;Hi All,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I may be buying a 73' westy hard top this weekend. 
&gt; I will probably have
&gt; &gt;about 30 minutes to decide if I want it or not
&gt; since it is located about 2
&gt; &gt;hours away.  He has been very open with the
&gt; condition of the engine and
&gt; &gt;exterior/interior and says it runs great, no issues
&gt; at all.  He has done
&gt; &gt;lots of work with the engine.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;So,  any tips or tricks on what to look for when I
&gt; check it out?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Also, what should I expect to pay for something
&gt; like this.  The paint is
&gt; &gt;good, only rust is on the bumpers, 2-3 minor dents,
&gt; great working engine,
&gt; &gt;and the mattress is in good shape.
&gt; &gt;Just a ballpark figure....
&gt; &gt;
