Subject: Re: [T2] Listees ? Vintage and Type II

Because the prices are often higher on the splitties (fewer folks with bucks to spend), the age related issues such as rust is more common (fewer people can fix this affordably or by themselves), splitties can't run down the road at 65-70 mph in stock form (splitties seem more primative than the bays, less appealing to the masses), and folks are still in the let's wear this thing out mode with the Baywindows whereas the Splitties are confirmed antiques (so more splitties are in garages or under cover than the baywindows. 

Also more splitties have been crushed and recycled than the Baywindows just b/c of their age. If 5000 vans get crushed per year, more splitties have been crushed than baywindows. Bet fewer splitties are getting crushed these days because &quot;they are worth something&quot;. 

Safety... 

Usefulness. Baywindow campers are more useful I think and would guess other folks think too. 

Any more? 

Chris
