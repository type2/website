&lt;&lt; but look and ask while they are working if they are installing the 
thermostat and flaps.  There are a lot of people that think this stuff is not 
needed........... &gt;&gt;

I was browsing one of the &quot;major VW magazines&quot; at the grocery store and read 
an interesting letter from a reader.  The reader was seeking advice regarding 
a stock engine and the editor of the &quot;tech&quot; section told them they needed a 
functioning thermostat/flaps and, &lt;gasp&gt; told them to replace their 
aftermarket .009 dist. with a stock one!

Seemed like quite an enlightened response from a magazine that is frequently 
bashed for pushing its advertiser's products in articles such as fan shrouds 
without vanes/flaps, chrome .009's and other cheap products that are inferior 
to the correct stock components.

Maybe a sign of growing awareness on their part that good literature, web 
sites, list serves and vendors like Ron and Boston Bob are creating a much 
better informed consumer than they used to market to 10 - 15 years ago? : )
