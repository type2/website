Subject: Re: 3-point shoulder belts for rear bench? Follow-up

&gt; My '71 has stock anchor points for the outboard positions of all seats.

Thanks to all who responded and pointed out that the bus should *already*
have the anchor points. Indeed it does, what a pleasant surprise! On the
passenger side, the anchor point was simply hidden by a plug, but the driver
side's anchor point was hidden behind the westy side cabinet that resides
over the spare tire hole. I had to cut a small notch into the cabinet to
accomodate the new bolt head, but it's hardly visible.

I used the seat belts that used to be up front and which I had once replaced
with self-retracting Volvo belts back in 1994 (I just found my post about
that conversion in the type2 archives--which conveniently include the old
vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu posts-- How time flies!).

Information is everything! I can't believe it took me this long to implement
this most important improvement. Thank you, list!

Sami
