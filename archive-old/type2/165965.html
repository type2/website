Subject: Re: [T2] engine dies when I brake to a stop, fuel filter keeps
  running dry

Hello List,

I want to thank everyone for their helpful
suggestions. I will be checking those out this week to
see if they are the culprit. I have noticed some
larger particles of rust in the bottom of the fuel
filter. I will keep everyone posted on what I find. I
am trying to get my beetle in tip-top shape to sell
soon. I have a baby on the way and I need a vehicle
that is more conducive to infant transportation. Once
I do that, I have to do some work on Francis (My 68
Bus) so I can start driving her again. 

Francis' rebuilt engine,(With less than 5000 miles)
started to 'bang' last year. The 'banging' started
shortly after my week long trip to Linville Falls last
October. It sounded like the heads were about to come
off when she was running. The heads were retorqued
which fixed the problem for a couple of weeks. Then
the engine gradually started to run louder and louder,
and the banging came back. I rechecked the torque on
the heads and it was in spec. I am going to yonks the
engine and pull off the heads to do some detective
work. Hopefully, at the very least, the short block
will be unharmed. Keep your fingers crossed for me. 
 
Anyway, I think about y'all often and I appreciate all
the help that I have received.

Cheers!
David Kelly
