Subject: Drive away tents....

It takes the two of us less than an half hour to completely set up the
tent, Coleman kitchen, stove, lantern, chairs......  you just do it.  If we
were really in a hurry, would we be driving a '65 camper?  Slow down, enjoy
life, the drive away tent is really magical, try it.  Jim
