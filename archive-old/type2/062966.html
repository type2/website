Subject: Re: 74 oil capacity

Overfilling may damage seals in some cases.  Also you wouldn't want your
crankshaft and rods to have to wade through too much oil.  ;)  

I check my van's oil first thing in the morning before I start the engine
and on level ground.  On trips I check the oil last (after pumping gas,
doing windows, etc.) at gas stations. If it is low, I top up to the minimum
line by estimate, as if I fill to the max line, it is always too full. 

Hope this helps,

Tom

&gt; All of the literature I have indicates that the oil capacity of my 74 bus
&gt; (and all air-cooled 72 on) is 3.7 quarts with filter change. My engine
seems
&gt; to take about 4.5 quarts before the dipstick reads full (top line).
What's
&gt; going on here? Something else I've noticed is that if I leave the
dipstick
&gt; in for a while it will indicate a higher level. In other words, if I wipe
it
&gt; off, put it in and immediately pull it out it will read full. But if I
leave
&gt; it in for a few minutes it will read more than full. What are the
&gt; consequences of overfilling the oil?
