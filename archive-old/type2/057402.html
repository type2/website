&gt;     I have no clue why you would think that not sealing the engine
&gt; compartment would have anything whatsoever to do with engine life.
That
&gt; hasn't anything to do with cooling, you know? More dust in the engine
&gt; might require more frequent air filter changes I suppose, but that's
&gt; about all. In fact, if anything, the engine would run cooler.


Who told you that a poorly sealed engine compartment will run cooler? 
The design of the engine compartment is such that cooler air is drawn
in from the intake vents, and is then forced over the  cylinder heads,
and exhausted out the bottom to be carried away by the movement of the
vehicle.

By leaving the engine compartment unsealed, you are allowing the fan
to suck in warm air from underneath the vehicle, where the fan just
blew the hot air.

The tighter the seal between the hot air under the vehicle, and the
cool air above, the cooler the temps of the air being blown over the
cylinders(relatively speaking, seeing as last week it was 106F here in
Austin), thus the cooler your engine runs.

That is how VW designed it, and it is in the best interest of those
who want their engines to last, to keep it that way.

Just my $.02.

Take it or leave it.

Cheers,

David
