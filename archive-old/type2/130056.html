Subject: BD x-pipe

Just installed new exhaust for 82 A/C van. BusDepot delivered a cross pipe. 
Gave me the tracking no. so I could anticipate my schedule. Received mid 
day yesterday. Stock uses studs and nuts, this uses bolts at the header 
flanges. Whether bolts or nuts, access to the top nut/bolt at each port is 
testy, not to mention that the hexes are rusted down and bound by rust. If 
you have S wrenches, box end, in 13 &amp; 12mm and 1/2&quot;, there is a 90% chance 
you can get that one off. If you don't have the S wrench you may have to 
remove the rear tin to access from above with standard wrench or hammer and 
chisel.

Imperfect fit up and hole alinement of the x-pipe with the heat exchangers 
is to be expected on this install. It took me a good 10 mins. to get that 
last bolt started. Issue of EGR pipe was resolved with a hex plug self 
tapped into the outlet. All bolted up nice and tight with good parallel 
flanges. You just don't get that with all aftermarket parts, so this is a 
source for a suitable pipe only VW specialists like Ron are providing.
