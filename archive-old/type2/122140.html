Subject: Re: [T2] PC in Bus

Are you meaning a tft monitor with tv tuner built in?
You can buy a box to let you use it for external stuff like
consoles or dvd's and such if you have just a standard tft
screen of any size.

An xbox is simply a pc anyway.. they use a celeron 733
cpu in them basic hard drive and stuff. But to each their own.

I ran some #6 in from my accessory battery, installed a fuse box
mid van and also up to the front for another fuse box. Didn't want
to have to worry about using the standard 'hippie wiring' for the
stuff I've put in.

TV's are bulky , they draw loads of power and look horrible for pc
stuff.  Ive got tinted windows in the van and if the sun is bad, pull
the curtains.. viewing the screen is never a problem with bad bright
light.

Speakers? I just connect what ever im using , xbox, ibook, blender ;)
to my inputs on my stereo.. stellar 5.1 sound baby :) (or something close)
I've also got a little creative labs set of speakers that are smaller than
a standard cordless phone that runs on batteries or plug in.  Much better
than small tv speakers.

Just more ideas to throw into the bus
