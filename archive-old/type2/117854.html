Subject: Re: [T2] 2 Q's: one FI, one transmission

Tom,

Is it a one or more wire o2 sensor.
You know how these things work, right?  They are supposed to flucuate 
rapidly back and forth between lean and rich when at running rpm and 
unless you have a heated one, they have to get hot before they work.

If it is a one wire, then you have to have a good ground where it is 
installed.

I don't think that you are going to get much action out of the o2
sensor with the CO screw at idle.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi all:
&gt; 
&gt; Today I dove under the vehicle to connect my voltmeter to the O2 sensor (I'm
&gt; going to route the sensor wire into the engine bay so, in the future, this
&gt; is an easier task) and found out the mixture is too lean and no amount of
&gt; fiddling with the CO adjustment screw would bring it into the right range.
&gt; I know the first thought is &quot;air leak&quot; but I'm 99% sure this isn't the
&gt; issue.  I used many new hoses in the install and the engine started right up
&gt; and settled into the proper idle RPM range after its 20 minute break-in.
&gt; Too, the idle responds readily to adjustment of the idle screw.
