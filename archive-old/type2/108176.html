Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum line question?

There should be a hose that runs to the vacuum advance canister on your
distributor from the EEC nipple. On mine there is a splitter on the vac.
canister, one to the EEC and the other to the throttle body. Check out
Richards diagram here for pictures

&gt; My question, where does the EEC (evaporative emissions control)
&gt; cutoff valve get its vacuum from.  This is the small nipple on the
&gt; side of the air cleaner.

&gt; Thanks,
