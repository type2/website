Subject: R-Blox Installation and a Q

Hi everybody,



I installed some R-Blox, (a DynaMat substitute), that I got off of E-bay
this last weekend. I put up a small page with some pictures and
procedures of how I installed it. Not that detailed but if any one is
interested it is there. I did notice a nice reduction in sound and 50 SQ
ft. for $50 bucks is a wicked deal.

During the installation I saw the floor and was wondering what these two
curved pieces cover up.

They are squared in by black boxes, I was just interested why they go up
and the rest of the floor is pressed.



Thanks,



Max
