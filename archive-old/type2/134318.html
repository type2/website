Subject: RE: [T2] Vanagon Experts?

&gt;  I am considering moving up to the next generation
&gt;  VW Van from my current 72  Westy to a Vanagon
&gt;  Camper.I am interested in getting some of your
&gt;  insight and opinions about these vans


I have Bus/Vanagon &quot;buyer's guide&quot; on my website that talks a bit about each
model's strengths and weaknesses, and lists the major year-to-year changes:
