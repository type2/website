&gt; 
&gt; What is the downside of 79's? i understand tha the 77's don't have 
&gt; Hydraulic lifters, but i was under the impression that 78/79's were 
&gt; pretty much the same???
&gt; 
&gt; just wondering-----&gt;Drew a 78/79 wannacamper
&gt; 
&gt; peace
&gt; 
&gt; 
The 79 was wider (why? we can only assume it had to do with the continued
manufacture of the baywindow in some markets, or tooling up for the Vanagon)

Other than that, the mechanic I use (Roger at Motormania, one of the best
in Centeral Texas) says that by 1978 VW had worked most of the bugs out
of the FI system. The hydraulic lifters are nice, set and forget. I'm
sure there are other differences, but I do not know what they are.

Cheers,
