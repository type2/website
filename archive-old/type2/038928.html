Subject: Disc brake servo vacuum

The brake servo only affects the disc brakes.  Technical references tell me that
the line the runs from the port off of the servo goes to the vacuum pipe off of one
intake manifold on the engine.  There is supposed to be a check valve that goes
between intake manifold and the vacuum line.  The purpose of the check valve is to
prevent pressure caused by potential backfires from reducing the vacuum
efficiency.

My bus was missing several things including various electrical switches and
apparently that check valve.  My brake servo vacuum hose was not connected to
anything, but just open to atmosphere.  The vacuum pipe on my left side manifold
has a rubber plug on it.  This explains why my brakes were so super stiff.  I knew
that I had line leaks.  The previous owners left three bottles of extra super heavy
brake fluid in various locations inside.

What I'm alittle confused about is why there are intake manifolds without that
vacuum pipe (there also sold with the vacuum pipe), unless there are alternate
vacuum sources that can be used such as the fan shroud..  My fan shroud has several
extra openings.  One opening has a round nipple that appears to match the I.D. of
(my) the vacuum hose.  That diameter is about twice that of the vacuum pipe from
the intake manifold.  I would think that the vacuum produced within the shroud
should always remain constant (when running) and would not require that check
valve.  However, the hose could not have reached that nipple on the shroud.  Maybe
it was rotted and the PO or some hired mechanic cut the length off, neglecting to
understand the consequences.

I'd greatly appriciate any comments about this situation.

Thanks...
