Subject: Re: [T2] Transition from Gas to Diesel

&gt; &gt; I will be the first to admit that I have very little knowledge of the 
&gt; difference between a gas engine and a diesel. With that, can a standard FI bus 
&gt; engine be converted to diesel?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; From a practical standpoint, no.
&gt; 
&gt; But remember that anything is possible with enough money and desire.
&gt; 
   Anything? A VW-based hit 'n miss engine... ?-)
