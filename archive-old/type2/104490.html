Subject: Re: [T2] Catch-22 / Can't open Slider

Hi Mike,

&lt;snicker&gt;
This will work, but it will be messy, and it may release fluorocarbons 
into the environment. Follow these instructions at your own risk.
&lt;/snicker&gt;

Puncture the can with a sharp stick. Once the contents are no longer 
under pressure the soft metal of the can will be a lot easier to 
compress. Now use a blunt stick to smash the can flat until the 
diameter is reduced enough to get the door open.

Your bus is gonna smell lemon-fresh for MONTHS!!!  ;^)

Happy trails,

&gt; This is really embarassing.
&gt;
&gt; You know that little area in a '69 Westy, just ahead of the spice 
&gt; rack, on the floor, between the sink and the sliding door? It's 
&gt; perfect for putting a bottle of Windex (tm), 409 (tm) and the such.
&gt;
&gt; Well, I put a tall can of Pledge (tm) in there, and closed the slider. 
&gt; Can't open the slider anymore. Why? The inside handle can't move 
&gt; forward. Because the tall can of Pledge (tm) is there.
&gt;
&gt; I can't fish the bottle out from the inside, either. It fit too tight.
&gt;
&gt; What's next?
