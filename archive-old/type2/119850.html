Subject: Help! Break in questions

Just got my new longblock running, and there is a lot
of smoke coming out of the tail pipe.  I had enough
time to adjust the timing and it seems to be running
fine . . . except for the smoke coming out of the
tailpipe.  Is this normal? if so, how long should this
continue? if not, what may be causing this?  I checked
the compression on one of the cylinders, it was 150,
so it doesn't make any sense because doesn't seem like
oil would get past the rings at this compression level
enough to make it smoke.  any advice greatly appreciated!
