&gt; My VW manual says to torque the nuts on the rocker arms of my Type V engine

Are you mistaking inch-pounds for foot-pounds?  260 inch pounds equals a
bit more than 21 foot pounds.  Seems pretty outlandish if you made that
mistake, but just in case...

I always verify torques in more than one manual if I am unsure of what
they should be.
