&gt;       I use Gasahol (10%) ethanol in all my vehicles, and experience 
no problems whatsoever.  Don't confuse Ethanol and Methanol.  Methanol 
has some of the problems you cite.  The only problems with using ethanol 
back a few years when it came on the market in the midwest were with 
some plastic parts in carbs (floats primarily) particularly in Chrysler 
Corp products.  It will clean the old varnish, accumulated debris from 
the tank surface.  You might change your fuel filter after running a 
couple of tanks as a precaution.                
        You're right about it running cleaner.  The octane rating of the 
fuel will be raised a couple of points as well, and any water condensate 
that accumulates in the tank will be removed.  You will never! have a 
frozen gas line in winter.
