Subject: Re: [T2] Late bay owners? / part help needed!

Chris,

I'm not sure I would call it breather hose, but after I saw the pic I 
understood what you were after.

Unless you just *have* to have something with a vw part number, you can 
probably do quite well on sizing from a flaps like NAPA. 

It just needs to be gasoline quality stuff.

Cheers, dave

&gt; This would be too hard to describe, so here are a couple of images.
&gt; The first is a picture of what I have, and the second id a graph showing all 
&gt; of the parts that should be there. This is on a 76 westy.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone have a spare parts bus, or know of a location where I could aquire 
&gt; the parts I am missing here?
