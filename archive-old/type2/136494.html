Subject: nice early bay from Cal on the I-5 in Seattle

I saw a nice early Bay this morning goin South on
I-5 in Seattle.. California plates.. He was poking along
at like 50 mph .. oblivious to the traffic arouund him. :-)
  Funny thing is that his passenger side tail light AND headlight
were both pretty dim.. the driver's side .. both lights were about
normal brightness... what would cause just one side to be dim like
that?
cruddy ground?
  Other than that it was realy a nice looking bus.. aftermarket green.
