&gt; Hello everyone.
&gt; The Litchfield Bug-in is this Sunday in CT. I plan to go, are there
&gt; going
&gt; to be any list members there? I think LIMBO is involved.

Hey there John,

Barring any unforseen problems, I'll be there Sunday. (I might head
out Saturday to camp out, even though I didn't make reservations).
I'll be wearing my type2_dot_com t-shirt, or just look for a beige 79
Westy.

I'm in Warren, RI (off of RT 195) and will be heading out thru 95 in
Providence to RT 6. If anyone wants to &quot;Carabus&quot; down there, drop me
an email.

See y'all down there....
