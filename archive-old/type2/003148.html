When I took my tank out, the fine mesh screen at the output port was
completely shot, and I can't find it now.  So, I'm looking for the male
fitting that screws onto the tank's female thread.  Anybody?  My tank has
been plastic coated inside and out, so I'm not all shook up about
reassembling without the screen, but I have to have that fitting.  TIA.
