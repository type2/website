Then explain why GEX is still in business!  :)

One law of business seems to be that &quot;cheap pushes out good.&quot;  In terms of
our VWs, this means that there is a proliferation of &quot;10,000 mile
rebuilds&quot;, ill-fitting rubber and tin, etc.

I try to make it a policy to buy from the suppliers that make a concerted
effort to stock quality merchandise.  I may pay a bit more, but it is
ususally repaid in service and advice.
