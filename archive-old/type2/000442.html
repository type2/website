Should I be worried about the following.....
	I was cruising along doing 55mph when I started to climb a long hill.
	As the car slowed, I applied more pressure to the accelerator, but power
just seemed to fall away. I geared down into 3rd to pick it up again, but it
just kept dropping away even though I had my foot flat out on the pedal.
	I pulled off, kept her running, and went back to listen to the engine...all
sounded fine. I limped back onto the motorway, thinking of all the possible
problems, when....as suddenly as it had happened, it went away, and I
climbed back up to the 50's.....now I can't stop worrying about it.
	Is it a clutch thing, or was I just putting to much on the gas ??
...any thoughts/help would be appreciated.
Garp
