Well, IM(NS)HO :-), I like the pressure method best.  I don't own a settup
for it, so this is very much a case of &quot;do as I say&quot;, but this is the
method VW intended, and I think it is the best.  The danger of splitting
the resevoir is minimal if the pressure is kept to a reasonable level,
like under 5 psi and if it does, you probably needed a new one anyway.  I
don't see the resevoir splitting, anyway.  The bigger danger is the hoses
from the resevoir to the MC splitting, and I am not so much worried as
optimistic.  I have replaced a couple of MC's in my time and the condition
of those hoses is often *shameful*!  They ain't gas lines, so they are not
regarded as critical, but they should be replaced after 30 years!

Second choice is the handy dandy Mity Vac vacuum method, which I have
used successfuly. I had not thought of teflon tape on the bleed screw, but
I think it is a good idea and will try it next time.  The extra bubbles
were always a problem for me, and this might well eliminate them!  I would
*NOT* use grease on the threads, as brake fluid and grease do not go
together at all well.

Lastly is the old standby, if you have a POSLQ or friend standing by.  One
pumps while the other bleeds.  Works well, and has much tradition behind
it :-)

BUT......

My one sure piece of advice is:

Make sure all of your drum wheel shoes are adjusted right against the drum
before you start!!!  so that the wheel is stiff to turn!!!  There is very
little fluid moved about by the master cylinder in any case, if you use
most of the pedal travel moving brake shoes, bleeding will take inordinate
amounts of time, if it does not fail completely!  After the system is
bled, then readjust the brakes to a slight whisper of contact, but for
bleeding purposes, you want all the brake shoes tight against the drums!
All four wheels!!!
