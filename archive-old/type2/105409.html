Subject: Re: [T2] Vibration/noise in front around 55 mph?

&gt; Sounds like the speedo cable.
&gt; You could unscrew it from the speedo and spray some lube down the cable
&gt; casing.
&gt; Tri3 Teflon spray should reactivate the lube that is still present on the
&gt; cable.

Cool.  That makes plenty of sense.  I'll give it a try and let you know
how it goes.

Thanks,

- Miles
