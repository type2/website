Subject: Re: Front wheel bearing grease

Gregor,

You said that you wanted to clean and repack the front wheel bearings....
Here are my thoughts on the subject:

For the longest time I used plain old 'wheel bearing grease' sold
in a one pound tub. It worked OK. Then, I started having problems with
the left front wheel bearing. It would start putting up a racket,
Id pull it apart, take all the old, rusty grease out, put in new grease,
adject it, and go on my way. 6 months later, it was back up
to the same old tricks. 

(Two sets of wheel bearings later...)

I decided that water was getting in the speedo hole. I tried duct tape,
electrical tape, silicone caulk, all to no avail. Nothing would stick.

So, one day I was down at the marine store (No, you dont buy marines there,
that is what Tijuanna is for...) and I see a big tub of marine-strength
wheel bearing grease. Higher cooking point (Important for disk brakes)
and excellent saltwater resistance. So, I bought a tub. Packed
them up, and I am still driving on the same grease today, about two
years later. This is of primary importance in Norther States that 
see salt on the roads in the winter. 

Now, I am rebuilding the front end again (because I got free hubs and
disks, thats why!) and I am considering the 'semi-syntho' mixture that
is put out by Valvoline. Says it is good for wheel bearings, 
CV joints, etc. I may try it, leave it in there over the winter
, and inspect it in the spring, to see if it is holding
up well. (To the list: Has anybody else had good/bad experiences
with syntho wheel bearing grease? What about using it on CVs?)

Also to the list: How about setting the end play. I always seem to 
make it too tight or too loose, and I spend about a week adjusting
it every day until I get the sound to diminish without clunking
when I go over a pothole. I know about the sliding washer 
trick. The question is: How much force to slide the washer?
Pry with a screwdriver, push with a screwdriver, etc?)
