Subject: Type 2 High Top Registry Begins !!

Well, since a query of this and two other boards for a High Top Registry
resulted in ......nothing, I'm starting one.

The International Volkswagon Type II High Top Registry.

All owners are invited to join. Don't know what that means yet except send me
your VIN numbers, owner info, JPGs, vehicle description and any story you wish
to tell about your ride.

Anybody and everybody is welcome to send JPG format pictures of High Tops in
their towns with as much descriptive info as you can gather. The more owners
names, VIN numbers, info on color combinations, roof types, interiors and
manufacturers the better. I've seen at least four different types of roofs.

Submissions will need either a VIN number or a picture to be counted and added
to the list of known high tops.

All pictures and submissions will be credited and posted on my web page that I
haven't learned how to do yet. Any help in this area is gratefully welcomed.

So far, I have pictures and VIN info on three and SAM DAM has sent pictures and
info of his and two in his town so at this time the Volkswagon High Top Registry
has SIX listed Volkswagon Type II High Top vans. SAM DAM's  ride is #4 of 6.

Alright.................!!!!
