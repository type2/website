Subject: Re: [T2] engine seal

That seal MUST be in place, I pulled mine out as a test last year, and the
engine ran 50 degrees hotter, and that was just with 75 degree tempps
outside!

&gt; Paul,
&gt;
&gt; The seal is very important to maintain proper cooling. If the seal is
&gt; missing, in poor condition, or not properly installed the you will be
&gt; sucking hot air from the underside of the motor instead of cooler air
&gt; from the vents on the side of the bus.
&gt;
&gt; The seal should be widely available from many vendors. Try
&gt; www.busdepot_dot_com. If you have a VW dealer in your town they should be
&gt; able to get it as well. Do not rule out the dealership for parts. VW
&gt; still has odds and ends for air cooled buses.

&gt; &gt;I Have recently acquired a 78 Bus and it is missing the seal between
&gt; &gt;the engine compartment and the engine tin.I have looked at several
&gt; &gt;websites with Bus parts and can not find this seal can anyone get a
&gt; &gt;part number for this seal or a parts supplier who would carry it and
&gt; &gt;its exact name. I was told i need to get it replaced soon or the
&gt; &gt;engine will run hot.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.
