We are in Red Bluff, California. All good driver and multi-vehicle
discounts. Don't have a homeowner's insurance discount though.

&gt; I previously paid about $100
 more with GEICO -- they had been giving me good rates for about 8 years and
 then mysteriously started to ratchet them up, presumably because I'd been
too
 loyal.  I'll check back with GEICO when my term with GMAC is up.

I've had Geico a couple of times in the past, haven't been able to
match our rate. Have also had Amica and USAA before. Good Sam has been
trying to get us, but their quote is $165/year.

&gt; I'd also like to put in a word against Allstate.

We had trouble with Allstate on our homeowners insurance. Will never
deal with them again.

John
