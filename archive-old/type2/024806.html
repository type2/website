Hi All,

As the proud owner of a ´72 camper, I wouldn't trade her for for anything. But
there is one thing that really gets to me -The lack of an overhead engine
access that the other year models have. Did VW do this just to make our day? 
Anyway, My question is: Has anyone ever modified their 1972 Bus engine
compartment deck to put in some kind of access from the top? If so, how big a
job, etc. I'm thinking of finding the hatch from a later model year and somehow
modifying the deck. Comments?

TIA,

John B
