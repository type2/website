In response to printing your own type2 stickers (Jaime Chriswisser's
suggestion)- most inkjet printers have non-waterproof inks- but you can buy
some Laminating sheets and create a waterproof double sheet sandwich which
should overlap itself all around the  sticker.  I did this for a &quot;facsimile&quot;
license plate  I created to stick onto the box that goes on a bumper shelf
and occludes the fixed plate.  MB  78 Westy
