Subject: RE: List Mailings

Thanks Jason I just added a filter to incourage Hotmail to send all my BUS 
mail to the inbox. Maybe that will help.

&gt;As a fellow Hotmail user, I set up a special rule telling Hotmail to put 
&gt;anything starting with [T2] in my Inbox.  The list's server puts that 
&gt;prefix on every Email, so it's pretty much a slam-dunk to have Hotmail look 
&gt;for the [T2] and not get spammed.
