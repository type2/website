&gt; My questions are:
&gt; 1. What is the best way of draining the fuel tank?

unhook  a fuel line from the output of the pump, put it in a can, hook the
pump to a 12V power source.

&gt; 2. How much does a fuel tank hold?

The book says a Vanagon holds 16 gal, but i have never gotten past 15.

&gt; 3. Once the fuel lines are replaced how do you remove the air
&gt; from the lines.

Not necessary with FI.  the fuel circulates thru the fuel ring an dany air
goes back to the tank pretty quick.

&gt; I am sorry if these seem really simple questions, but please
&gt; forgive me I am a complete novice at this.

Andy, they are only stupid if you don't ask them and get bit!
