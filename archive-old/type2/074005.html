1.5 is good, no more than 2 max

&gt; I know i need to adjust these valves differently since i have hydraulic 
&gt; lifters.  I know i am supposed to take the adjustment screw down until it 
&gt; hits the valve spring.. but then how much farther??? i'm thinking like 1.5 
&gt; turns or something. but i can't remember and can't find it in the muir book.
