Whilst driving my '80 Vanagon a couple of days ago in the Auburn, CA 
area I happened upon a nice looking standard light green/white split. 
Enthusiastic waves exchanged.  5 minutes later a nice red/white loaf 
with VW emblem rear mud flaps waved, but I was engrossed in some 
mundane thing as finding my turn signal lever, so failed my duty to 
respond.  Next day, same bus, this time I was busy applying both 
hands onto steering wheel.  If you are on line, ~w!~w!~w!
I was in the beige '80 Westi.

One can do without, but waves help us along.
This applies to both surfing and life
 . . . . which to some is the same.
