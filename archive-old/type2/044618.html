On of my local lumberyards carries 1/8&quot; birch veneer plywood in 4 X 8 ft
sheets.  Look for a lumberyard that caters to cabinet makers - they should have
it.  I have not checked, and my bus is at home, but if the ceiling panel needs
to be more than 4 ft wide, a seam with a 1/8&quot; ply cleat behind it to reinforce
it could be done.  Use thin A (cyanoacrylate) adhesive, available at any hobby
shop that sells RC airplane stuff, for an instant and permanent bond.

&gt; Assuming your referring to the paneling over the front seats on campers.
&gt; There is a European size available which is 5'x5', but no one stocks it.
&gt; You have to special order it so $$$$. The other two options are to run the
&gt; grain sideways, which is the cheapest solution if you will be painting or
&gt; covering it somehow, or the way I did it, and have a seam down the center
&gt; on the 1/8&quot; Oak veneer plywood with clear finish. Speaking from experience,
&gt; the center seam doesn't work very well.
