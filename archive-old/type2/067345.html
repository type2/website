Subject: Re: welding

oh....something i've heard from a welding friend of mine...

tuck the SHIRT in the GLOVES, not the GLOVES in the SHIRT.

as in, when the slag runs down your glove and then down the open sleeve, 
and pools at your elbow, and you dont really relize it, then lower your 
arm...lets just say..SURPRISE!:)

enjoy

&gt; Advice: Practice, practice, practice and then when you think you are 
&gt; ready, dummy up what you intend to weld and practice some more. 
&gt; Especially practice in the position (vertical, overhead, flat, etc) 
&gt; the 'real' weld will be in.  Weld puddles don't want to behave.
