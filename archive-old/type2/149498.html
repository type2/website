Subject: Re: [T2] sliding door woes

Hi Dave
Thanks for the response.
I just want to make sure I have this right.
The door is shut and unable to open. It's securly latched
at the rear of the sliding door allowing no outward motion of the
door.

If I am to understand what you are saying I need to remove the
rear sliding runner cover exposing the hinge and stuff. As well
as removing the front channel gear.. this will allow the rear
latch to unlatch? How?  I have looked at the locking mechanism
and it's not going to allow the door to pull out. If I remove the
door gear to allow the sliding door to come off (outwards) it will break 
something
in there I believe.

Another thing is the front lower runner requires the door to be open
to undo the screws to remove the runner/bushings etc. The top
one would be no problem.

Please clarify.
James
(Im not criticizing or anything, came from the lake with an edgy
significant other, a cooler which has milk and food going bad in it
stuck under the jump seat locked in by the sliding door (don't ask :)
Just tired here.
Please and thanks!

Remove the exterior channel cover to expose the rear roller and glide 
bushing.
Remove the lower roller assembly. Support the door before it drops on your 
foot.
Remove the roller from the pin in the upper channel.
Lift the door out of the  rear catch. Then remove the lock assembly.
