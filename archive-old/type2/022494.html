Subject: brake problem with a twist (help)?
Mime-Version: 1.0

If I repeatedly pump my brakes while my 77 is at a stand still, I can stall 
the bus out.  After looking through the archives, some list member say the 
problem may be a bad booster.

Before I went out and bought a ~$300 booster, I thought I would poke around 
and check the whole vacuum circuit.  When I disconnected the decel valve 
and plugged all the vacuum ports that were connected to it , I would pump 
my brakes in the same situation as before and the Idle would increase 
instead of making the bus die as before.

If any body may have an insight as to what my problem may be, please let me 
know.
