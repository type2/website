Subject: Re: [T2]tire broke inward this morning on me

for immediate &quot;get it off the road help&quot; you could go to your local FLAPS
and get a &quot;wheel dolly&quot; you jack the bus up and put this under that tire
and VERY VERY VERY slowly tow it home.  the only way you could drive it
would be to find some way to LOCK that axle so it would not turn other
wise you would cause additional damage.

hopefully someone else has a better solution
