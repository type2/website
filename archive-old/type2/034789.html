&gt; &gt; It is quite important that you mount the antenna to the roof, as
&gt; &gt; mounting the antenna to the side of the bus will reduce your
&gt; radiated
&gt; &gt; power by quite a bit.
&gt; 
&gt; Location on the car matters, too, if I recall correctly.  If the
&gt; antenna
&gt; is at the rear of the car, your range is stronger towards the front,
&gt; and
&gt; vice versa.

This is true to a point, but trying to use any car for a counterpoise
(ground plane) in the 11-meter wavelength is a tremendous compromise. 
Just get the antenna on top of the bus and you're 90% there.

&gt; &gt; OK, assuming that you do all of the above, what kind of performance
&gt; can
&gt; &gt; you expect?  In open terrain (line of sight) you might get a mile
&gt; or
&gt; &gt; two of range.  In the mountains it will drop to a half-mile or so.
&gt; &gt; Don't expect too much of a CB!
&gt; 
&gt; True, but in optimal situations your range can be much higher than 2
&gt; miles.  5 miles was not unusual in my old MG with the Sharp
&gt; 23-channel;
&gt; sometimes at night, parked (no ignition noise), I could hold
&gt; conversations with people 10-15 miles away.

Also true, but most communications does not take place in optimal
conditions.  I prefer to quote the realistic numbers so that the reader
won't be disappointed.

&gt; George is very correct on the antenna length issue, and you might do
&gt; well to get help there if you don't have an SWR meter (locals can
&gt; borrow
&gt; mine :).  The length of the antenna and cable should be physically --
&gt; or
&gt; electronically, through a &quot;tuner&quot;, but that's less effective --
&gt; matched
&gt; to some multiple of the wavelength for CB (10 meters) to get a
&gt; standing
&gt; wave ratio closest to 1:1.

Actually, the best antenna is a quarter-wave on 11m, which is a
straight whip 108 inches long.  This is 9 feet long, and unfortunately
when you put this on top of a bus you end up with an overall height of
15 feet, a bit more than the 13-1/2 feet allowed.  This is why I
recommend the 6 foot helical Firestik.

The actual length will vary slightly from the exact 1/4 wave because of
the small ground plane, which is why the antenna has to be tuned to the
vehicle.

Now _that's_ an old call!
