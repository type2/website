Subject: Re: [T2] Friday: a small problem &amp; question

Don't know about the transmission problem, but if you run over the tire with
another automobile to break the bead, you can take the tire off with a couple
stout screwdrivers and/or a wonderbar.

Good luck,
John

p.s. - noticed you're at GA Tech. Ever consider joining Southeastern VW Club?

&gt; Hi!

&gt; I saved this for Friday since it's not urgent (I think); when I shift
&gt; my '78 Westy into reverse, it works just fine &amp; goes into reverse,
&gt; but when I take my hand off the shift lever it 'pops' out of the
&gt; 'pushdown' I guess...  But, it stays in gear.  Anyway, it makes a
&gt; decided pop.  What is out of adjustment?
&gt;
&gt; Also, I have several extra rims I got when I had to replace my
&gt; damaged ones; they're salvage &amp; have badly weathered (useless) tires
&gt; on them; I was wondering if there's a way to take the tires off
&gt; myself, so I can store the rims out of the way somewhere?
