Subject: Great Bus Tour Trip Rep 3/3

Hazelhurst to Miami
After a restless short nights sleep I woke up at 630, cleaned up, walked
the dog, checked and left mail and readied for the trip home. I woke
Charlie and Dave to say goodbye and was out into the chilly fog by 8am.
Gas stop and gone..Damn it was foggy and for a long time crossing 295
over the bay near Jacksonville, must have been around 10-30 or 11,  it
was eerie. all I could see was the road in front and not much of it.
I ran pretty hard with not much in the way of stops all the way to Cocoa.
The miserable Ga weather had turned to sunny florida winter around 75 and
I was pretty tired. I took some time to put in the jalousie screens (I
never had any before) not saying Im slow but it took me a while to figure
out how they go in, called the family and curled up for a nap. The bus
was just like a cave in there It couldnt have been more comfortable.
I slept maybe 45 min and woke up feeling just right. Back on the road plus 
I had the Dallas and then Miami games on the radio for entertainment the
last 4 hours flew by. The family loved the Bus Tour box it has a cool
aura. Plan is to pass it on to Mike Green in the keys this weekend.
I was dragging a bit today at work but it was well worth it.
cheers
