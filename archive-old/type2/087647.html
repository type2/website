&gt;    Whilst these tyres will give you superior grip in snow &amp; muddy
&gt;    conditions and on dirt roads,nothing comes without a trade-off.
&gt;    You will significantly reduce you on-road handling with these
&gt;    type of tyres so be aware of that and consider carefully how
&gt;    much of your driving will really be in conditions requiring
&gt;    such a tyre.

FWIW I've run recently Firestone Wilderness AT's (gasps of horror
from the I'm too stupid to inflate my tires correctly crowd) on the
vans and they handle simply exceptionally in all circumstances on
or off road even though they are a pretty chunky agressive tread.  They
are a bit loud at 60-65mph is my only gripe but traction in the dry, wet,
and handling even in the very tall 27x8.5R1 size has been phenomenal.
Better hands down than even the last set of true XZX reinforced I had.
Much, much superior handling compared to some non reinforced tires
I've had vans come with though my thoughts on replacing tires just
because they aren't C load range are long, long stated over the years.
But as usual YMMV.  And this was on Vanagons not buses though I
don't find much difference most of the time between the handling of the
two generations.  Anyway just saying a modern A/T tread can be pretty
amazing on road, after all most of them are designed to put on those
overprice pigs of SUV's that never really go offroading.  A real good sort
of mix tire for those interested is the less agressive Mich LTX if it is still
available as it is somewhat less chunky.  It was never available in a
&quot;stock&quot; size however so if you are stuck on 185R14 your choices are
somewhat limited.
