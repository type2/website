Ok,
            Im confused.  I took a pic of where the throttle body was
removed from the intake air manifold.  Just so I know that I am not
making a stupid mistake..this is the throttle body right?

And this is where it connects to the intake air manifold right?

This is where I am trying to figure out if a seal should be present or
not.  Cause there was nothing.  Thanks for helping me out.  Sorry I am
so green.
