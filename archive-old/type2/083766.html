Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust stud size

Measure them :)

Seriously, I just got through replacing 2 exhaust studs on my 2 liter
just this night. They are very odd studs. The half that goes into the
head is a 9mm thread &amp; the half that the exchangers bolt to are 8mm.
8mm parts are easy to find, but 9mm parts are complete bastard things.
At least that is what I believe you should have ;)
