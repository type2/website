1978 stock sunroof bus, repainted lemon yellow.

located in Cambridge, Mass., about two blocks from the
Good News Garage, i.e., halfway between the Car Talk
guys' place of business and the Charles River here in
our fair city.

I learned to drive on a '63 camper and it was almost
brand new at the time; you figure it out.
