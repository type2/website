Subject: Re: [VB] Vacuum values

Vacuum varies, according to throttle position (and manifolld pressure): Full
throttle, climbing a hill, vacuum is at its least. Coasting downhill, foot off
throttle, vacuum is at its greatest.



If you've ever driven a really old car (early-1950s and before) that had
vacuum-operated windshield wipers, you've seen the relationship. In my 1953
GMC pickup truck: coasting downhill in gear at high speed, foot off throttle,
the wipers go very fast. Climbing uphill, pedal to the metal, wipers barely
move.



From the Bentley manual, I find that, for Bosch distributor 039 905 205 C,
vacuum advance begins at 60-120 mm Hg (2.4 - 2.7 in. Hg) and at 240 mm Hg (9.4
in. Hg), provides 11-13 deg of advance.

mesthinks that vacuum will go up in proportion to RPMs.
I don't know what sort of value it should have


..............-----Original Message-----
1600 sp  Does anyone know what the vacuum meter should read from the carb port
that
goes to the diaphragm on a single advance dizzy, and how it should behave
with
increasing RPM?
