&gt; Oh what a pain but I got my exhaust system off in the hopes of killing my
&gt; catalytic converter and cleaning things up a bit.  Ended up breaking a
stud
&gt; in the process, can I get new ones?  I want to have the whole unit
&gt; sandblasted and remove the catalytic converter.  Problem is the flange
from
&gt; the pipe that goes into the converter doesn9t match the flange from the
&gt; other side of the converter that goes into the muffler.  So I9m thinking
&gt; about just getting it welded (the pipe to the muffler or silencer9), but
&gt; I9ve heard welding places aren9t allowed to participate in the death of a
&gt; catalytic converter?  A buddy said I could just hollow it out and leave it
&gt; in place, but I think it may be easier said than done.  I priced new
exhaust
&gt; systems and it doesn9t really sound worth the price but I can tell my
system
&gt; is impeding my idle- it runs so much better with no pipes or anything.
Any
&gt; ideas?
