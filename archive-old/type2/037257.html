&gt;Seems that if you really want to ruin a natural feature, all you have to
&gt;do is get it declared a National Park.  :(

As the topic is “summer vacation,” this rejoinder is literally off topic.

The National Parks are usually not too crowded if you go off-season. I 
have been to the south rim of the Grand Canyon several times in late 
March when more than 1/2 of Camp Mather was still closed up. And I was 
there in early December once, during a snowstorm. The canyon rim was 
never more beautiful and there was _nobody_ except the village residents.

In the summer, if you can figure out how to beat the heat, the desert 
parks are terrific. Devise a swampcooler to keep you cool at night, and a 
ramada in the daytime. Or camp at an RV place and run an airconditioner. 
Drink lots and lots of water, and enjoy seeing the saguaro bloom 
(something that all the snowbirds miss).

Acadia National Park is drop-dead gorgeous in the winter. Or go there in 
May, just ahead of the tourists and blackflies. It’s great in autumn, as 
well. In fact, the only you don’t want to go is summer.

The only way that I would visit the Grand Canyon in the summer time would 
be if I took the train in from Williams, stayed in the El Tovar, and 
generally first-classed it.
