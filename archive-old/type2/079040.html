Subject: ADMIN:  Required Reading

Hi all,
For the benefit of those who did not receive a copy of the list charter when
they subscribed, please take a look at
http://www.type2_dot_com/type2charter.html.

This document spells out all the rules of the list and what happens when
they are broken.  Please, if you have not read it, read the charter and save
yourself the trouble of being removed from the list for reasons unknown (to
you).  If you are removed from the list we will not send you an e-mail to
tell you about it (who has time for that?), you just won't get any more
mail.  When you try to resubscribe, your request will be rejected
automatically.

If this should happen to you, write one of the admins directly.  Our e-mail
addresses can be found on the type2_dot_com web page.

If you feel that the list rules are too restrictive, feel free to
unsubscribe.

Thanks,

Sean Bartnik
Type2 List Admin
