&lt;&lt;  you were ever involved in an accident, regardless of who or what caused 
 it, the other party could claim that you altered your tail lights, turn 
 signals and brake lights thus deliberately reducing their visibility to 
other 
 drivers and causing or contributing to the accident.
 
 They could also claim that your modifications increased the damage done to 
 either their vehicle or their persons and request a larger claim or lawsuit 
$ 
 amount.
 
 Even if your modification had no role in the cause or severity of the 
 accident you give &quot;them&quot; something that could be used against you and thus 
 drag things out even longer. &gt;&gt;
I do agree that safety is a factor here, but I doubt most people would even 
know what tail lights would be correct on any particular year of bus. As long 
as the aren't bullets off a caddy or something.  I had a friend try to use a 
similar argument when he slamed into the back of a toyota that had blackouts 
on the tail lights, didn't get him very far.
