Subject: Center console

I'm working on a design for a center console that slides out, pivots,  
and slides forward from a cabinet behind the front passenger's seat.

To help me work through the design, it would help to receive, by p- 
mail, lists of things that bus drivers regular keep in some kind of  
center console -- or wish that they could.

Thanks!

Mark, dreaming of the next Peregrine
