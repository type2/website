Oh how awful.  Add that to the long list of things that will cause your bus to spontaneously explode/burn/crash according to certain people, such as:

Oil temp &gt;240
coilover shocks
NOT adding a pint of MMO every oil change
Revving past 4400rpm
Pertronix/Compufire
Tires with sub-1520lb load rating
hydraulic lifters
fuel injection

aaaaggggggghhhh I can't stand it anymore!!_at_!  Someone please rescue me, I'm stranded on the misinformation superhighway!  :-/
