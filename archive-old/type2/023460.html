Subject: Parting out 1970 Campmobile
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello all,

My brother, Gary Hull, is parting out his 1970 Campmobile.  He has been 
trying like mad to sell it whole but no takers, so he will get rid of 
whatever anyone wants before banishing it to the junkyard...  His e-mail 
address is HullGod_at_aol_dot_com, anyone interested in parts drop him a line.
