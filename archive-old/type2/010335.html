Subject:  sliding middle side windows for 1976 bus

    Looking for 2 good used sliding windows for my son's bus. Any  ideas
where to look?  Thanks, Bill S.


Bill, I have 2-3 good sliding windows that came out of a '77 bus. (The 
slider was just sitting on the floor!!)  They still have the rubber on them. 
  Two are the normal sliding windows, and the rubber is the kind that has 
the chrome insert.  The chrome insert (actually plastic) would need 
replacement, or if the rest of your son's bus has chrome inserts, this would 
be a good fit.

The third window has the solid black rubber.  But this window has a screen.  
The screen slides open and close, and can be latched open when you are 
camping.  It is in pretty good condition, and i don't know which side it 
belongs on.

I plan to go to Bever Springs PA this Saturday/Sunday and try to sell these 
windows, and many other pieces of glass (no windshield).  I will be asking 
$35 each for the regular sliders, and $40 for the slider with a screen.  
Since all three have 'serviceable' rubber (which means you could install 
them right away), I hope to find someone who could use them.

If you are really interested, let me know.  Since I don't know where you 
are, shipping could be expensive, and it, of course, would be at your 
expense.

I am in Northern Virginia

(And I am STILL searching for a clean starter/solenoid for a '76-'81 manual 
trans!!!)
