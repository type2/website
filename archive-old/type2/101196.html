Subject: Re: [T2] replacing bars in westy luggage rack

i also have a 71 westy which had the same problem..  i used some 3/4 inch 
pine  1 1/2&quot; wide to replace the bars, although the wood doesnt bow upwards 
like the bars did , i just added one of the self adhesive doohickeys 
underneath each piece of wood.. you know those things they sell to put on the 
bottom of chairs to keep from scratchin the floor. anyways two years later my 
wooden luggage rack is still holdin up fine on my 71.  ... good luck!  peace 
.. scott ..71 vesty  ...
