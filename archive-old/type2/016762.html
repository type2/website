Garp:
Before I can get my brain on the right book and page, I need to know
what exactly we're talkin about. A 72 USA spec type 2 would have a 1700
engine with 2 32-34 pdsit Solexes. We have many European and Australian
listees whose busses might might be 1600 dp motors with 34pict-x
Solexes. The tuneup protocols are completely different for these EXCEPT
for the following:
 Carbs get blamed for many problems that aren't their faults, probably
because they're the interface between your foot and the unseen workins
of the thermodynamic device called the engine. Therefore, when you have 
problems check:
A. Ignition points condition, setting (gap or dwell),condensor, timing
(initial and advance function), wire condition (watch it at nite)
B. Spark plugs take'em out, they should all be the same tan color on the
insulators and have nice square edges on the electrodes. Have new ones
there before you start. Be proactive- put those too-good-to-throw-away
ones in the boxes and put them in the glovebox.
C. While you've got the plugs out check the compression. If it's not
okay, see D, otherwise put the plugs back in
D. Set the valve lash. With too tight or uneven lash, your engine will
never run smoothly, and you may burn your exhaust valves.
E. If it still has problems, now consider the carburetor(s)
