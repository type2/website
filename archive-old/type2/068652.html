Subject: Re: VW Soul (or lack thereof)

All the saturn owners i've known just LOVED their new little cars for a 
while...the longest that i know of was 7 months. then they just slowly 
get tired of a car that is just a culmination of all american cars ever 
built.. &lt;IMHO&gt;

then some end up with justanotheramericanpieceofjunk that noone wants to 
buy, and they are stuck with it, or they trade it in &lt;which, btw, they 
tend to hold there value fairly well..&gt; on something japanese..or 
german..one saturn owner friend traded it in for a mid 80 Mercades..


my observations..

&gt; &gt; My sister and her husband just bought a Saturn.  While I don't find
&gt; &gt; their cars aestheically pleasing, it is so cool to hear her talk
&gt; &gt; about it.  She talks about her car like I talk about my busses.  She
&gt; &gt; gets excited.  They actually have a continuing relationship with
&gt; &gt; their dealer--unlike many other list-members who would love nothing
&gt; &gt; more than to go strangle their dealer because they got screwed around
&gt; &gt; with &quot;failing head-gasket syndrome.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I dunno, maybe I'm just cynical here, but what creeps me out about the
&gt; &quot;Saturn Phenomenon&quot; is that it seems kind of company-created. I mean, VW
&gt; never really advertised the Volkswagen phenomenon, the sort of
&gt; collective spirit among the owners. Their advertising was witty, sure,
&gt; but it didn't use the community as marketing. Seems to me that GM took
&gt; that social thing that was the Volkswagen (or maybe Harley) owner thing
&gt; and turned it into a marketing concept, creating the Saturn label and
&gt; setting it up as the Volkswagen of the 90's. 
&gt; 
&gt; It's like Saturn is to Volkswagen (of yesteryear) as the new Chrysler
&gt; Prowler is to a street rod - the co-opting of an owner-enthusiast driven
&gt; phenomenon by a big corporation. 
&gt; 
&gt; Am I really too cynical? I mean, I guess people really do love their
&gt; Saturns... I dunno.
