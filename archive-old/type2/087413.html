Subject: putting front doors back together-new rubber ???

I have all new rubber from West Coast Metric for my 71 Westy

the van is painted now and I need to put the doors back together....

they are bare shells now....

what is the order I need to put things back on ?

its been 6 months and I forgot how I took it apart

Also does any of the WCM rubber need trimming etc
