two different threads going here

only thing I'm talking about is mounting the extension tube so you can use
a VDO presure sender on a type 4 case

AFAIK the sender provides no cooling what so ever

I have had mine in (and out a couple times) over several years with no
leakage but that still doesn't mean I am not paranoid

other thread is about big engine and cooling

I'm stock 2l with stock cooling and it stays pretty cool as long as on hot
days I don't lead foot it on the interstate

&gt; Man, you guys are fooling with the lifeblood of your engine. If your setup
&gt; is not engineered to twice the level of my skill, you put your bearings at
&gt; risk. If you feel the need of a cooler running motor with dry sump and big
&gt; oil supply, put in a 911. But that is only if reliable horsepower at the
&gt; lowest cost is truly the goal.

&gt; &gt;&gt;however I am &quot;Concerned&quot; about vibration and metal fatique,, anyone have
&gt; &gt;&gt;any experience with this or the piece of pipe breaking off??
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Hi Bob,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I used the brass pipe method of mounting the oil pressure sender on my 
&gt;   I usually try to lean the sender against something 
&gt; &gt;solid (dizzy, tin, injector rail), but I think the engine vibrations are 
&gt; &gt;waving the sender around and enlarging the hole.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Sounds like the flexible hose is the way to go...
