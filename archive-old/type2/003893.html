My '73 Westy turned over very slowly this morning. I suspect that worn
battery cables could possibly be the culprit. While I was checking the
routing of the positive cable, I noticed that the positive cable also has a
smaller gauge wire that terminates inside a plastic junction box. There are
two screws holding this plastic junction box inside the engine bay. This
wire clips inside the plastic box. I was looking at a wiring diagram and it
would seem that this wire should go to a voltage regulator, but this plastic
box is clearly not a voltage regulator. Is this the correct configuration?
What do I do with the voltage regulator wire when I replace the positive
cable? Do I hook it up to this plastic junction box?

TIA,
Larry
