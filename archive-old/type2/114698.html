Subject: Re: [T2] pushrod retaining wire broken?????i need one

&gt;&gt;I would think that you would need them if the engine originally has umm...?&lt;
&lt;

It's kinda more of a worst case scenario. The tubes should hold pretty good, 
but if one
of the tubes does work loose you could trash the engine quick. They were 
included in the engine to help keep that from happening. More like insurance. I 
would try to find one soon.
