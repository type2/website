Subject: Re: Stranded Man on Van Dorn Street

       Not to throw a damper on it, but you guys are aware that there a
many thousands (hell, millions, maybe) of people in like straits, right?
I mean, I know a lady that lives here in Oshkosh who lives in her car,
and she'll get pretty onery if you try to talk to her. She was hanging
out down at the place where all us sailboard freaks hang out on the
lake. We noticed her living there in her car, but paid no attention,
it's her trip, right? Then she bought a gallon of white house paint and
a brush and painted the car -- I mean the whole thing, tires and all,
inside and out. One surfer whose into drug rehab went and asked her how
she was doing and got told to F* Off.  Now we call her Surf Angel.
Firgure she's there to watch out for us. Don't know where she goes in
Winter, maybe south.
       I guess what I'm saying is -- before you getting really going on
rescueing this dude, make sure he really wants to be rescued. And it
also might turn into a full-time occupation, one way or another.  Not
that you shouldn't offer a helping hand, but it's also pretty hard
sometimes to rescue people from themselves. Some people want to drink,
some want to die, and some just want to live in a dead bus on the side
of the road  and do their thing.  It's their trip. I know people who do
pretty well dumpster diving and begging. But yeah, he could probably use
a new engine to get him a little further south.
