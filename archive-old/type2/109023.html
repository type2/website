&gt; I'd also find it silly that anyone buying a 25+ year old vehicle wouldn't
expect something to go wrong after the purchase.

Ah darn...

That came out different than I'd intended.

I agree with Tom.  If the seller presents the item as more than it really
is, then the seller ought to be hog-tied, tarred, feathered and run out of
town on a rail.  If the seller tells the truth, then it's expected that
there might be something that might go wrong after the purchase that the
seller could not have been aware of.

My bad.  No offense intended.
