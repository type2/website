Subject: Re: [T2] shift lever springs(was tranny bushings etc.)

Billy,

I didn't make the translation from 12mm to 1 inch in my head when i saw 
those numbers on the list, but mine is *not* that long(this is from 
memory 2 months ago)...but it seems that it was only about 1/4-1/2&quot; long.


Doesn't anyone have one of these siting out of their bus right 
now?.....Joe Mitchel?

Cheers ,dave

&gt; Okay, so the pin that points forward (f is f) of the shift lever ball should be about an inch/12 mm long...
&gt; 
&gt; Mine is obviously broken off.
&gt; 
&gt; There should be a spring (not the large conical one around the shift lever itself, that tensions the shift lever ball in a front to rear direction. Does this spring go in front of the shifter (around the pin) and against the inside front of the cup (pushing back), or behind the lever (pushing forward)? I assume forward since Dave(?) says the pin must remain forward, thru the slot in front of the cup.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this part available?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks everybody,
&gt; 
&gt; Billy (no spring in the 76 or the 79!)

&gt; &gt;The pin bore in the base of the shift lever has a small coil spring
&gt; &gt;whose only function is to make reassembly more difficult.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Whoa!  I don't remember any spring down in the cup when I took mine &gt;&gt;out to grease it!  I wonder if I am missing said spring?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;This picture doesn't show it...

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;The &quot;protrusion&quot; on the bottom of the shifter is about an inch long
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Remember that the pin has to be all the way forward.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;The problem comes if it is at all back thru its hole.&gt;
