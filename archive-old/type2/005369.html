 A. Blake Sartin &lt;bsartin_at_utkux.utcc.utk_dot_edu&gt; wonders

&gt;What gives?  $40 for the '70, $109 for the '69.
&gt;
&gt;Why will the '70 MC not fit on my bus?  Anyone?

Been there, done that, on my '70, born 8/69.  Ordered the cheaper '70 MC.
Didn't fit cuz it only had one fitting for the brake light switch(es).
Seems I needed the '69 unit, I have two switches three terminal.  Cost? Bus
Depot sez '70 is Brazil, '69 is German.  I suppose you could cut off one of
the switches and rewire the circuit, but that's not my style.  Bottom line,
count your switches B4 you order.
