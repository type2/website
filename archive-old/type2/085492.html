George Lyle sends:

&gt; I didn't know about the secondary radiator.  Was it installed after the
&gt; primary to solve a heat problem?  If so, I'd definitely suspect a
&gt; recirculation problem, as the primary radiator is huge.  You pretty much
&gt; have to have a fan on the radiator in this sort of installation to keep
&gt; the air moving while stationary.
&gt; 
&gt; It's critical to have some sort of ducting to keep the hot air away from
&gt; the air intake.

He says he installed it for towing. It does have three-way ball valves on it
to route coolant through it. This Bus also contains a 4.3-liter Vortec V-6;
it looks like he put it in there with a crowbar--that engine bay is TIGHT!

The worrisome part of this installation is the small lines he's got running
between the ends of the bus--IIRC, they're less than 1.5&quot; which is smaller
than the hoses that were in the S-10 he got the engine from.
