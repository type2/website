Subject: oilpump/filter combination

I've got a good quality oilpump/filter combo that has the pinned cover and
extra support for the shafts in the pumpcover as well. Problem is it's for a
late model dished cam, and I need the earlier one. Anybody got one they'd
like to move along or exchange for this one?
Thanks,
Courtney
