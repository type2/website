Keep in mind that the torque value on those bolts is only 80lbs! I removed mine from the '72 motor without a braker bar. I did not use a flywheel lock either. I think I put an extra socket on one of the opposing bolts and put a pipe wrench between that the one on the ratchet ( I think I used my torque wrench) to remove for leverage.) be careful not to over torque up reinstall. 

While you are in there replace the pilot bearing ($2 part.)

&gt; What are the proper tools to use in removing the five bolts and gland nut off a 78 Type IV?  Is a long breaker bar attached to a socket sufficeint?  The manual calls for a flywheel lock.  Is this a specialty tool?  What should I use?
