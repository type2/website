Volks,
   You are the greatest!  A little earlier today I asked for info on 
curtains, and now I've got it.  I had over a dozen people p-mail me, so now 
I know what I need to do.  The new curtains will be a winter project, so 
those of you here in the northeast can expect to see them at next year's 
events.
