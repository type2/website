&gt; &gt; These and other folks left the USA last Sept. They are part of the
Caravana
&gt; &gt; Pan-America trip that was conjured up by the members of the Vanagon_dot_com
list.
&gt; &gt; for all the trip reports, preplanning, shipping info, etc....Go to
&gt; &gt; Vanagon_dot_com, and follow the links.

&gt; thought they were solo, how does one get past the Darien gap though
&gt;

They have a few diary entries about their troubles getting through.
They shipped the bus in a container but got hung up on the receiving end
getting the bus back when it turned out that the shipping company had not
paid some fines that they owed.  Resulted in a 10 day delay, going back to
the docks every day, only to be told, come back tomorrow.

There is currently 48 entries for their trip and I read through the last
half of them this morning.

Made for some interesting reading.  Was trying to imagine my wife putting up
with even half of what they've been through.  No freeking way.

A couple of times their westy has let them down, not being able to 4WD up a
hill.  Other than that, it sounds like quite a ride.
