Subject: Now I've done it...

The guy who owns the 73 Bus I posted as FS yesterday called me this morning.
Parents are breathing hot and heavy down his neck, and the upshot of all of
it is I just bought the damned thing for $75.

Looks like our son (15) just got his first car...  Might even be able to
drive it someday :)
