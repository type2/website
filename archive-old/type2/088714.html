&gt;Hey check this out...
&gt;
&gt;http://www.dansmc_dot_com/Spark_Plugs/Spark_Plugs_catalog.html
&gt;
&gt;Im in the 9-10 range.  Ive never seen aplug that looks
&gt;like their best.  Right out of the box maybe!!

If this is from '77 I assume it is for leaded fuel??
It would be nice to see a chart for Unleaded fuel, or better still unleaded
fuel with an upper cylinder lube as I use. In my 2L type 4 motor they all
give different plug colours/looks.
