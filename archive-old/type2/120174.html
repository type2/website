&gt; I need some electrical help today, my car started to run erraticaly since

&gt; the carb I noticed some spark jumping from the 15 terminal of the coil
&gt; (bosch red with external ressistor) to the cable that goes to the dizzy, one
&gt; of the terminals was a little closer (the one that goes to the carb) so I
&gt; reposisioned then I noticed some sparks jumpimg among the wires over the
&gt; generator, somebody have any clue on this matter?

When wires get old they lose their insulation ability.  Sounds like you
could use a new set of plug wires!
