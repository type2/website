&gt; Does anyone have a picture of an INA made Throwout Bearing? Most are
&gt; Sachs but I discovered that INA (one of the VW OEMs) are still
&gt; available.

There are two INA bearings available that I know of. One is part number 113
141 165B, this is made in Brazil and the good quality, but the outer
diameter of the release bearing (the part that spins) is a lot smaller that
the OE Sachs TOB. This TOB is good for upright engine applications with the
supported TOB. I don't like to use this one in a bus, especially a late one
with the large clutch.

The other INA bearing we have is 091 141 165. This is made in Germany and is
the same size as the German Sachs TOB, if not a bit bigger. This one is good
for a Bus or Vanagon.

I will update our website later this week with photos of the different
bearings.
