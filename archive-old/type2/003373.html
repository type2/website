&gt; 4. The LH carb had the choke valve all the way open all the time (ie
&gt; vertical). I tried to turn it to the closed position by hand, but it
stopped
&gt; after moving about 20degrees..._dot_come to think of it, maybe I was trying to
&gt; push it the wrong way???  What do I need to look at to correct this??

I believe the left carb has the fast idle cam on it. In order to close the
choke you have open the throttle halfway.
