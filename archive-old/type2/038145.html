&gt;&gt;According to the rough map that Leo had drawn out based on the folks signed

&gt;Kentucky and making a big loop though Indiana, Michigan, Illinois Missouri,
&gt;then south through Oklahoma and Texas before finding it's way across the
&gt;Rockies and to the West Coast.
&gt;
&gt;So, how 'bout it?  Will the afore-mentioned &quot;VintageBus list member&quot; who has
&gt;it take the initiative to move this thing westward?

I really don't care anything about this...  I suspect most everyone that 
had an interest in it has lost interest, hence the lack of momentum behind 
it...

I talked to the guy who had it in Jacksonville, FL who said he had been 
waiting for a guy to come get it since February.  I took it and gave it 
to someone to get it moving again.  It is now in Newnan, GA but it will 
be at my house in Marietta, GA this Friday morning if anyone wants to 
move it west.  Otherwise it will be in Greensboro, NC Friday night and 
someone can send it west from there.
