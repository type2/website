Subject: NJ inspection woes

Hey folks- I've p-mailed a couple of you and thought I'd ask the list in 
general (at least the NJ residences).

My '77 just failed safety inspection due to the rust (&quot;no sharp edges 
allowed&quot;) and because my front seat springs/frame is poking through.  Short 
of having the rust fixed and replacing my front seats, the bus will never 
pass inspection.

The only options I can think of is to find a more sympathetic garage 
(suggestions welcome) or to register it as an historic vehicle, which puts 
restrictions on how I can use it, and how many miles I can put on it per 
year.

Anybody in NJ (or other states) have any experience in this?  Talk about a 
royal PITA, especially since it is my only vehicle right now.

Thanks for any suggestions or ideas

Patrick
'77 Westy
Madison, NJ
