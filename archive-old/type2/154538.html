Subject: Re: [T2] Spare tire mounting

I'm not sure that VAT means you would have to pay that tax ... we have a 
similar concept to the VAT in Canada .. only we call it the GST .. and a 
foreign national would not have to pay that tax .. or if they did pay it 
they can get it back when the leave the country .. so ..

jdd

&gt; &quot;All Prices include VAT and Carriage&quot;
&gt;
&gt; That means Tax and Shipping? I wonder how they'll take to shipping to
&gt; the US... ;)
&gt;
&gt; Just Kampers ships here and it's pretty reasonable...
