Subject: Replacement sill panels

To Stephen O.   ---- Have you checked gypper rust repair panels?
Sometimes the autobody supply guys have catalogues full of these.  I
expect the rocker/sill part for VW passenger µbus rear doors would
have the same cross section as your rear door sills.  If so, it would
be a matter only of shortening the repair part, right....??

Found my dusty brochures from ~1985, showing
Mill Supply, 3241 Superior Av, Cleve 44114, (216) 241 5072
Tabco,  5250 Naiman Pkwy, Cleve 44139, (216) 248 5151
Possibly the area codes have changed;
check  www.switchboard_dot_com  or  the Thomas registry.

Hope this  may help you
