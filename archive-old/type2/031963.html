Subject: Are german Mahle pistons &amp; cylinders worth paying more for?

Hi Volks,

I've pulled my engine to fix bad blowby in my #4 cylinder. Although I had 
good compression (130+-5 psi all around), #4 pretty conspicuously failed 
a leakdown test (70% bad, vs. 25% bad on the other 3), with oily plus to 
boot. Engine is an oily mess headed for the engine bath. So I'm in the 
market for a new set of cylinders and pistons for my 1978 auto tranny 
2.0 L Westy. 94mm, dished piston, part no. 029-198-075.

The Bus Depot sells Cofab parts. So does The Volks Cafe in Santa Cruz. So
do just about all the parts ads I see in the various VW mags. I'm told
Cofab is a Mahle factory in Brazil, run by Mahle and making heads to Mahle
specs. A local mechanic I have some confidence in tells me I should 
insist on only real german Mahle (or Kolbenschmidt, if I can get 'em) 
because no Brazilian parts are as good. I believe there was a time when 
that was true, but since reputable businesses like those mentioned above 
(ignore the mag ads- they could be wankers) push the Cofab parts, I'd 
guess they must be pretty good. The mechanic is an older guy, BTW, whose 
opinion may well be shaped by market conditions of many years past.

Then there's price to consider: german Mahle $400-$480, Cofab $230-$270. 

I want the best for my bus since I'm driving it for the long term and I 
go rough, remote places in Baja in it. But I'm not interested in burning 
hundreds of dollars on german parts if the Brazilian Cofabs really are 
just as good. 

I want current opinions on how good current parts are. Should I spend the 
extra bucks for german Mahle cylinders and pistons? I'll gladly spend 
more for better quality, but don't want to burn needless cash.

Please advise.

Drive safely,
Surfer Bob
