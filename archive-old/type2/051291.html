Subject: [T2] More oil leaks!

I have had oil leaks on my 74 Westy since I got it.

Yesterday I noticed that I now have a good deal of oil on top of the
engine tin in the engine compartment as well, especially around the hole
for the #2 spark plug.  I pulled the wire, stuck my finger in the hole
and found a great deal of oily gunk on the inside of the tin.  I have
also noticed it is not running well in the last few days.
Any guesses where to check?  Could there be a problem with the head?
This is all still pretty new to me so I ask for patience with my
questions.

Thanks,
