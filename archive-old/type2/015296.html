&gt;This will be a series of submittals addressing basic Maintenance Repair

&gt;German Engineering Philosophy, hereinafter refered to as the
&gt;Deutsches Methode (DM).

&gt;All Porsche air cooled designs, including of course VW, can be provided

&gt;Doktor Porsche and others of the German technical schools who practice
&gt;the DM.

Today's subject is the procedure for validating the function of the 
battery. A proper multimeter is required (See post #20840).

A little test before we get started. Hold the + lead to the + terminal
and touch the - lead to various and sundry places around the top of the
battery case. See more than 0.5 volts anywhere??? Yes, your battery is 
in need of cleaning. Try this on a 4 or 5 year old battery that has not
been serviced since installation and you can get 3 or 5 or 7 volts running 
around the dirt and acid condensation that collects due to the absence 
of periodic maintenance, which is contrary to the DM. The battery becomes
it's own parasitic draw. 

Remove the battery. Clean the case with a paste of baking soda and
water. Rinse and dry. Pull the caps. Clean the newly exposed areas
around the holes with disposable towels. Top up the cells, if required,
with distilled H2O. Dry the top again from the drips. Take the voltage 
across the terminals.

12.6 volts or higher ist gut after an overnight rest. New batteries
will be at 12.7 volts off the shelf. If it is less than 12.6 it should
be charged. At 12.5 volts this can be done at 10 amps for a half hour
or so. Check the voltage with the charger on. I don't like to see
more than what a good alturnator would deliver, about 14.5 volts max
charge rate for batteries needing a short boost.

Let's say your battery shows 8 volts give or take. That will need a
much lower feed rate, not more than 4 amps, and several hours to
fully charge. Only after the battery takes a full charge can it be
load tested. If it doesn't take a full charge, it's toast.

Let's say the beast has been sitting for 10 months and the clock
drained it to 0.5 volts. Two days on the 2 amp trickle charger is in
order if you hope to save it. 

If the battery after charging shows less than 12.5 volts, it's toast.
If the volts look decent, reinstall it, hook up your multi meter,
note volts, turn on high beams, monitor the voltage drop. This will
be couple tenths of a volt drop on a good battery in a minute or so.
A marginal battery will lose two or three times that in less time.

After a minute or so note the voltage, turn off the lights, then
monitor the rebound. A good battery will rebound within a few minutes
to 12.6 volts or better. 

If during the lights test the voltage dropped a full volt or more, it's toast.
If it doesn't rebound to 12.5volts within 10 minutes or so, it's toast.
Both these items assume it was fully charged to begin with.

Do this if the battery is marginal. With + lead on + terminal, connect
the - lead to a nail, then dip the nail into each cell in order. You should
get 1/6 the total voltage from each cell, a little over 2 volts each for
a good battery. If any cell is much less than the average for the other
cells, it's toast.

Toast, in this sence means that the first frost of fall will be a hair pullin
session when trying to get to work with a clicking starter problem. It doesn't
mean that you can't keep on gettin on for the interim. Don't wait for it to 
fail. Know that it has weakness before it fails and replace it at your
leisure.
Keep the terminals and case CLEAN and you just might get 7 years out of that
5 year battery instead of 3.

SAFETY NOTES:

Batteries contain acid. Use goggles and rubber gloves.
Unplug the charger both before hooking up to and disconnecting from the
battery
terminals. Sparks can and do blow up batteries and can turn your greasy
fingers
and shabby clothes into a fire you cannot blow out with your snotty nose.
