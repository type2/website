Subject: Pin woes

&quot;Oh..the kingpin is connected to the linkpin and the linkpin is
connected to the.....&quot;

Gunter called today...not good news :(  It would appear that the
passenger side kingpin spindle is beyond help [I knew all that camber
play was a bad sign ;)].  So now I am shopping for new spindles for
Ras Bulli Split and we'll have to take the Jetta to Cape Breton this
weekend .... this would figure after putting Bill &amp; Jim [of BusBoys]
through the circuit to rush and order so that I could have the silly ol'
windshield wipers ready for inspection [sorry guys].

On the other end of things...the starter is going and #2 and #4 valves
tightened up over the winter... I was a little surprised by this as
the Bus hasn't been running since last summer...who knew?  The starter
just started acting up last week...it barely rolls the engine over..
I don't suppose the PO left a 6v starter on the bus when the engine
was done over to a 1600?...Nah...it couldn't be something that lame...

So I am looking for a respectable provider of kingpin spindles.  So
far I have been quoted two prices:

        Wolfgang International          199.95 (USD)
        Bus Boys                        249.00 (USD) plus $150 core-charge.

I didn't manage to get ahold of either Bow-wow or RMMW before they
closed, so I will call them in the morning.  I have never dealt with
Wolfgang before and have no idea about their quality [I am sure Jim
will explain why BusBoys' price is $50 higher ...make that $70 once
converted to Canadian dollars].

Anyone have a good set of spindles sitting in their driveway or garage
that they would like to part with...please?


Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits [with fallen pins]...Oh, my!
