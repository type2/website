&gt; Hi All,
&gt; Another problem I have run in to - I can't find a  14-inch wheel/rim for my
&gt; bus - I just discovered that I had three 14-inchers and one 15-inch which
&gt; was why it was riding unevenly.   I am running the two 15s on the front as I
&gt; cannot find a 14 incher - yet.  The 15s are all over the place.  Would it
&gt; hurt my bus if I  used all 15s instead?

Not at all, though 15s are rare on baywindows buses.  I'd love to find a
set of narrow-5 stock-appearing 15 inch wheels.
