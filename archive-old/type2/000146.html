 We got a shipment of those little heaters you plug into your cigarette 
 lighter, that are designed to clear the fog from your windshield. They 
 claim to put out HUNDREDS of BTU's. Pay attention here because a butane 
 cigarette lighter probably would be rated in the hundreds too. &gt;&gt;

I posted this a couple of weeks ago, that these things are worthless. I hope, 
at least, you didn't pay for it, or can return it.  When you say &quot;we got a 
shipment,&quot; I assume you work for a place that sells these stupid little 
&quot;heaters&quot;? If so, I hope when a customer asks if they work, you'll tell them 
the truth. You'll generate more heat from a fart than these things can 
produce!    Jeff S.
