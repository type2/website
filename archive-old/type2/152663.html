&gt; I'm reading this late so I guess I should be glad I missed it. Why would
&gt; ANYONE support VWOA in their effort to exploit the vintage community? They

continue
&gt; to not support ANY effort to keep the hobby alive and healthy like other
&gt; manufactures do. &lt;expletive abbreviation deleted&gt; them and the evil
empire(Disney). I hope NO ONE went!!
****************************
While Scott and I do share a close facsimile of Steve's opinion above,
Scott did not solicit either VoA or Disney.  Both offered support and
money for the 50th Anniversary of the Karmann Ghia Introduction Cruise
(the original title for the on-going event) on their own and it
mushroomed into a much larger event tie-ing into VoA's 50th as well as
the plug for the new Disney Herbie-Fully Loaded movie.  Much of the
on-going cruise and it's activities wouldn't be happening without
their support, so it's basically take their $$ and run with it.
Rachel w/her Single Cab Pickup is in her way repping the Vintage Bus
&quot;volks&quot;, along with other &quot;volks&quot; with their rides are coming in from
other points to participate in short (or long durations).

delete key anytime), I'm passing on the latest &quot;short&quot; intinerary
provided by Richard Troy of the KGCNA.  All within reasonable driving
range are invited to participate, regardless of your valid (or
invalid) opinions:

More when possible...

We would all really love to see as many of our K.G.
and VW friends as possible and we would like to ask you to please help us
reach out to those we may have (probably have) overlooked to contact about
our Cruise.

We know there are many VW clubs en-route. Please take a fresh look at our
Cruise route ( http://www.airheadparts_dot_com/index.asp?PageAction=Custom&amp;ID=1
) and think of the clubs whose teritory we'll be entering. We
would appreciate it if you can please then contact them and tell them
about the Karmann Ghia 50th Anniversary Cruise, and that Herbie is with
us, too.
