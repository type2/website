Subject: RE: [T2] Duncan's new bus (oops/power loss update)

Cheers for the heads up Billy &amp; Jerry :)

The Bentley manual is on order...going to be interesting bedside reading!

Sounds like I'd be best leaving the rubbers until after the respray next
spring, but I have to replace the scrapers as they're letting in buckets of
water :/

When you say 'rattle-can' it - I assume this is stick some close colour over
it until it gets to the spray shop to have the proper job done?

Ah - can't wait to get my hands dirty!!

Cheers :)
