Subject: RE:  stick shift qstn 

&gt;there is a plate under the spring and retainer beneaththe stick 
&gt;shift.  it has a tab going down on one side, and the tab on the 
&gt;other side has an additional piece of metal on it that closes 
&gt;the machined area off that the stick shift goes down thru into 
&gt;the shift rod.  obviously the tabs go down, but which sidedoes 
&gt;the extra bit of metal go on?

You're right, it is the lockout for reverse (so you have to push down on the 
shift lever to get reverse).  The tab goes on the passenger side.  I know that 
sound backwards, but if you pick up a pen and stick it between 2 of your 
fingers and pretend that's your shift lever, watch the bottom of it while you 
move it to where reverse should be (top part to the left and towards you).
