Subject: Re: [T2] Adding a sunroof to an original westy

Hi Gman,

Actually, the VW sunroof is **designed** to keep elements making their 
way through the roof and into the bus. The felt seal does not prevent 
this, it just keeps debris out of the slider track.

The key component in a leak-free sunroof are the water ducts that go 
from the front corners of the roof tray. These are connected to drain 
pipes that duct the water out the bottom of the door pillars.

Without these water drains installed, your roof will leak like a sieve. 
My wife's 77 sunroof had plugged drains when we got it and the 
headliner was totalled. The PO had put a high-top on it but did not 
want to sell the high-top with the bus.

If you're doing this conversion, you will have to find a way to 
retrofit the water drains too.

Please be sure to let the list know how you did it, there are people 
who are interested in the conversion you're considering.

Happy trails,
