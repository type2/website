What neck of the woods do you live in, Don? Here in San Diego North 
County (CA) we had a fairly hefty first-of-the-season* rain dump last night.

*Southern California has two predictable seasons: wildfire and mudslide. 
Rest of the time it's generally calm.

&gt;rains here.

&gt;I don't wanna go look. I just did all that interior work... Sigh.
