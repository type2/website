&gt; &gt; Can anyone comment on the effectiveness of front and rear sway bars and wind? My
&gt; &gt; location on the north side of Lake Ontario produces some mild winter weather,
&gt; &gt; but wind is an issue. Reinforced sidewalls made a world of difference, but I
&gt; &gt; have heard that aftermarket sway bars make a world of difference too....
&gt;
&gt;I found that a wider tire helps some, not to mention making sure of the
&gt;basics, tire inflation, alignment, tight steering, good shocks etc

I'd like to hear some more opinions because I've been considering this also.  I had terrible wind buffeting until I replaced all of the shocks with KYB gas-a-justs and now it's no why near as bad until a big truck passes you. The biggest improvement I made to the steering was to replace the clapped out steering damper.  Prior to that the wheel used to yank back and forth over simple speed bumps.

Leafing through the Bus Boys catalog there is a page on anti-sway bars but they say that they cure handling problems more than wind buffeting.
