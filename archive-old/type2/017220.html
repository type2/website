Subject: tires

Hello all   I've been looking for new tires for Bullwinkle (my '76
Westy) and found that the local Costco can special order 185R14 Michelin
XC4S tires _at_ ~$77 each.  These tires are LT load C / 6 ply (rated _at_
~3200 lb axle) and look like they would be perfect.  Has anyone used
these tires on their bus, and how'd they work?  Any comments would be
appreciated.
