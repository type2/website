Subject: Re: [T2] New Bus????

----__JNP_000_3dbb.008a.4706


By far, the newer bus's body is in better shape.  The rust on my bus not
only has eaten the wheel wells, it's attacking the frame, and the rocker
panels and all metal around there is gone.  I wished I had known more
about buses, and want so impulsive.....anyway......

another question.  the engine in the 74 is what is commonly called a
pancake motor, correct?  would the engine from my 71 fit in it?  The 71
has the 1600 upright.  Is it completely comparable?

Hi Kyle,
The problem you face has been faced by many.
If your first bus presents you with too much of a challenge, then.....
do a switch of allegiance to another.


It is as simple as that, and as difficult as that.


Given a choice between a bus with mechanical problems or body problems,
I would always choose the mechanically challenged machine.


Body work and rust battles can go on forever, and generally do.
Mechanical problems can be solved properly and you can expect the work to
last without too much future difficulty.

Good Luck,
