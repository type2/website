Subject: [T2] Mind Boggling Ignition Problem...

Hi everyone,
I had my bus running well on sat but when i tried starting it today it
didnt work.  I cant get spark to the plugs anymore.  I didi the full
ignition system check(condenser check, timing,point gap,checked points
for burning or glazing(none), checked voltage at coil(good), the only
thing i can think it to be is that I have a bad coil.  When i put my
test light from the + to the - side it lights up, but i cant get juice
from the - side to the dizzy.  I already talked to several
people(mechanics, parts store employees) and no one had any idea.  the
only thing i think it can be is a bad coil.  the weird thing is that I
had the coil working well(blue, bright spark) on sat.  Could
jumpstarting the car have affected the coil? I am totally at a loss.  I
was so happy to finally get the engine running after so long and now I
am totally frustrated.  You guys are always a big help and thanks in
advance.  Brian 71 westy
