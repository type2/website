Subject: Starting to get impatient

I'm venting,(I've seen others do it here so hopefully it helps), and maybe 
looking for some advice but I don't really have a specific question. I 
finally decided after 20 years of saying one day.... , to get another bus. 
One main reason for finally getting off center and doing it is the type2 site 
and this list. Here's what I seem to face, and I'm sure other's do as well... 
Not much to choose from locally. The '72 Westy here that I  can't get for a 
penny under 4k is going to cost another 2500 bucks to get the windshield rust 
problem and a couple of other spots and dings fixed and then painted. It does 
have a pancake w/12k on it, but I'll still have 6500 in the thing and some of 
you have already said that's too much. Before one of you says that's too much 
for the repairs you describe, let me tell you that no experience with body(or 
engine) work and very little free time dictates my farming the work out, and 
I'm only as good as what prices I can get locally. It's amazing how few 
places want this type work! That's the problem w/the ONLY bus available 
locally. Now, many of you have been very helpful about telling me about 
different buses around the country, and I've called and mailed about  a few 
of them. There was one in San Diego that initially sounded promising. It's 
for sell for 3500. It's a '72 Westy also, but I'm now  told there's some 
rust, and it's all the way across the country. I've done some checking and it 
will cost $1605 to get it shipped to Mobile, Al. It's that or the cost of a 
one way plane ticket and driving across country with a bus I don't know, and 
No mechanical skills, which I think adds up to a dumb move. I would also have 
almost as much money tied up, and the $1600 for shipping is just gone money, 
you know? Would any of you think it's feasible to find a reputable shop in a 
city where your about to purchase, and have them evaluate it for a cross 
country drive? I would much rather put the money into the bus than pay a 
transporter.. The third thing is when I check on one that seems to be a 
bargain, there are so many unknowns that I no idea (that inexperience thing 
again) what the restoration costs are going to be. In talking with the local 
resto' folks, they just laugh when you start asking&quot;roughly how much to fix 
this or that&quot;. They say &quot;man, bring it in here and I'll tell you&quot;. A couple 
of people have responded to me with their stories that sounded like the ran 
into way more suprises and expense than they originally thought. Last thing 
if I haven't put you to sleep yet! If I were to buy a &quot;show quality bus&quot;, are 
they pretty much guaranteed to hold their value? I realize I'm getting into a 
different league pricewise, but I would be getting more of a known. I'm not 
sure I can convince my wife on that route, because she's kinda' begrudingly 
going along with this as it is, but if she felt it was not something we would 
really lose money on in the long run, maybe she would go for it. I would also 
feel comforable up front knowing that even though I'm putting out alot more 
dough, It's more of a &quot;known&quot;. Maybe as I stay with this I'll get more 
comfortable with the process, and maybe I'll also know when I've found the 
&quot;right one&quot; but how you can do that long distance escapes me at this point.
Thanks in advance for any advice, directions, or condolences!
