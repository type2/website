Subject: Re: removable apron retrofit?

&gt;My 75 has a removable apron, non standard of course but a necessity with the
&gt;V8 engine I run in it.

Hi Steve.  I figured just saw down both sides, bolt or weld a couple of
pieces of angle iron on either side with drilled holes, then run bolts
through the holes to remount the apron.  Anything special I need to know?

Or maybe weld the angle iron in place first so it's aligned right.  THEN saw.
