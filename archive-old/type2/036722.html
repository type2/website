Subject: Fwd:  alt light on: 911 into VW

 Hi Sami,

&gt; Please forgive the cryptic subject line. Why would the alternator
light go
&gt; on at idle when an otherwise good alternator is transplanted (along
with its
&gt; 911 engine) into a Volkswagen bus?

 The alternator light is connected between the &quot;charging&quot; and
&quot;discharging&quot;
sides of the electrical system, so that it lights up if there is a 
difference between them. With the ignition off and engine stopped both 
sides are a zero volts, with the ignition on and the engine stationary 
the light comes on with current from battery to alternator, when the
engine 
is running and the electrics are OK both sides are at +12V (nominal) and
so the light is off. When a fault develops, the voltage drops on one
side and so current flows, lighting the bulb.

 If there is a duff connection or similar resistance then the light 
will probably glow &quot;dimly&quot;. If what you're seeing is a bright glow at
idle but no glow when you rev the engine then (assuming the battery
is charging off-idle, ie you measure ~14V at the battery) I would
guess that either the alternator is not producing enough voltage at
low speed (perhaps a faulty diode or two?) or the regulator is a little
out of whack, and not coping properly when the input's marginal.

 Does the light go from bright to off as the engine revs up?

&gt; I compared the wiring diagram of a '71 911T with that of a '75 VW
type2 and
&gt; found one difference: 1971 USA spec 911's have a diode between the
&gt; alternator light and the brake warning light. Could this be a reason
for the
&gt; symptom?

 I doubt it- though I'm not 100% sure, as I havn't had any cause to
study
that part of the circuit (being non-USA).

&gt; ...could there be an incompatibility between Porsche alternator and VW
&gt; regulator?

 Nope: When I was having problems with the electrics on my 911 I found
that the regulator on my '77 bus was not only electrically compatible
but
also plug compatible with the 911 unit. I had a bad connection at the 
starter, where the charging current is carried forwards to the battery,
which resulted in a dim glow at all speeds.

Cheers,
	W.
