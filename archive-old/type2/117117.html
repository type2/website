Subject: Bus Covers

A good friend of mine that I work with bought that sweet 76' Westy that was
for sale last week that we were all admiring. He flew down to FL to pick it
up and drove it back to VA with no trouble. His first bus and I think he's
pretty happy... So he asked me about a cover for it and there are several
listed by Bus Depot. Does anyone out there have anything to say about these
covers? Good, bad, cheap, worth the money etc... Thanks and welcome to the
wonderful world of Busses Reed. Now get on the list yourself and top
pestering me!
