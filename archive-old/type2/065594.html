Vacuum leaks will cause erratic idle.  Until I sealed all of them up 
my idle would *hunt* around.

I found that carb cleaner works as a vacuum leak check.  Spray some 
in the intake to the air cleaner to see how it affects your engine.  
Mine the RPM's went up.  Check all hose connections and hoses.


I don't know if the '79 has an electronic Idle Stabilizer or not.
The following assumes that it does (my '80 does).
The Idle Stabilizer does what it says, it messes with the timing or 
something to stabilize the idle.  On mine it was missing when I 
got the bus.  It is designed to be disconnected and the ends of the 
electrical connectors connected to each other.  My IS is located on 
the left side against the side wall, but with the very different body 
style of the Vanagon, yours could be anywhere.  Any mysterious 
connectors, round with three pins inside?  I needed a new IS to have
a stable enough idle to be able to pass smog.
The little sucker cost $150!  BTW, you set the timing with the IS 
disconnected and ends together.  If you look at the timing mark while 
the IS is operating, the timing jumps ALL over the place (indicating 
that the IS is working) assuming you have a good timing light.
 
&gt; yeah, yeah, whatever, I hear you saying.  Well here's the scenario:  The
&gt; engine will start, but idles very badly, oscillating between about 1500 rpm
&gt; and almost dying.  Pushing on the gas produces a more consistent, but still
&gt; oscillating and very rough idle.  No power at all.  By revving it up in a
