Subject: dash swap

Hello,
How difficult would it be to swap a 71 dash into my
74.
The dash on my 74 is thrashed, some po removed the
entire heater ducting system including the under dash
pipes, added about 16 holes for switches and
stuff,strippied about a 2in by 2 in square of foam
from between the radio and ashtray. and added probably
12 miles worth of wiing that I hope to remove. They
also removed the brakets that the instrument panel
mounts to so it is flopping around. I have a really
sweet 71 dash that I would like to put in, I would
also like to put in the istrument panel including the
instruments from the 71. what would be the big
problems and possible snags with this swap. Any help
would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Tyler
