Subject: Re: [T2] Restoration Info/Help(longish)


&gt;I am once again thinking about tearing my bus a part and putting it back
&gt;together.  This is going to be a large and complicated project.   I
&gt;want to come up with some sort of plan.  Having never taken this kind of
&gt;project on before so I really don't know where to start.

We stripped the exterior of handles and chrome, removed windows (all), 
removed poptop, removed all the rubber, prepped, painted, reassemble using 
new rubber everywhere. The put new paint on the exterior but not inside as 
that was okay.

Now the exterior is 99% done and I'm finishing the dash (new colors). I'm 
working in the cab so I can get it driveable sans interior except cab.

I've always looked at it like a reverse of the factory assembly - - - take 
off what they put on last. Remove items as assemblies as R&amp;R those 
assemblies right before you need to reinstall them.

&gt;Can you guys suggest a place or have a good road map for beginner
&gt;restoration?

There are some great e-mail lists just on bodywork and restoration. The 
order is revrse of the factory assembly. R&amp;R top while the paint for the 
body is being done b/c you pretty much have to remove the top to paint the 
roof well.

R&amp;R rubber while you repaint the doors b/c you need to remove it to paint 
eveything. Remove latches and catches at the same time - clean and grease.

We stripped ours down until the exterior could be painted without any 
masking tape. That required removal of everything and the dash too which we 
changed the color on.

Then we cleaned, polished, replaced, and painted as we reassembled the 
components.

&gt;Bus Info
&gt;1973 Transporter, Safare Custom Deluxe Camper(High Top) #356, Dual
&gt;Battery, 12/110 Fridge, Propane stove &amp; heater, pdp(?) in dash A/C, 1800 
&gt;w/Webber
&gt;Progressive.
&gt;
&gt;Engine is still strong and original but needs carb tuning.  I still have
&gt;not found information on which dist to use and how it should be connected
&gt;with this application.  I think I want to keep the Webber.

Consider buying a good Weber book. That carb is &quot;okay&quot; but not great. It 
replaced a better pair of factory carbs IMHO. It needs tuning and could use 
an air cleaner from the junkyard that provided heated air for the winter. 
$20 fix. Think you either need a Pinto or Asian air cleaner.

&gt;A/C is not hooked up. Someday I will try it and consider getting it
&gt;working.

Last project. Might even consider storing it until you get to it.

&gt;Body has an old repaint with the wrong colors.  Some rust in the rocks and
&gt;window, but mostly clean and straight.  Needs batter trays and other
&gt;assorted floor patches.

Better price the paint and materials to be sure your budget can handle it.

&gt;Camper most of the paneling needs to be redone due to leaking upper
&gt;window seals and poor drainage.

They can supply the 5x5 foot panel over the front seats. Might as well buy 
enough to do the bus. They will send you a catalog free.

&gt;Restoration Goals.
&gt;I want a nice mostly correct bus that looks and drives well.  While it
&gt;won't be a daily driver I expect to camp in it, run errands and go to the
&gt;occasional show.

Driver camper. That's what we are doing. Another of my goals was to stop 
any aging related to rust on my bus. I had minor rust under the front and 
rear windows. Paint/Waxoyl/bar oil/EXTEND rust converter.

&gt;Limits

&gt;Time and Money, while not limit less I want to do things right.

Just shop wisely and make your money go further.
