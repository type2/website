&gt; I'm not sure why Ron has to defend his business so often... He supplies to 
&gt; us at reasonable prices (sometimes the best) things we could not get 
&gt; anywhere else. I'm not slighting Busted Bus or any of the other listers 
&gt; that sell parts but they don't get slammed quite as often as Ron does. If I 
&gt; had not done business with Ron I might think Ron was doing something wrong 
&gt; but I've done business with him several times and it has always gone well.
&gt; 
&gt; Let's move on and quit slamming on Bus Depot. How many times do you think 

yeah, we gonna slam someone lets slam some folks that really deserve it,
like GEX.........duh!
