Hi Mark-

There is a great page for Porsche 914 owners that includes a tech
article on how to build a cool little display for the cockpit (sorry,
pilot talk) instrument panel that displays the data from the Oxygen
sensor.

http://www.pelicanparts_dot_com/techarticles/mult_air_fuel_monitor/mult_air_fuel_monitor.htm

I can't take credit for finding it; I saw it mentioned on this list and
I'm adding it to my project list (my '76 Westy doesn't use a lambda
sensor)

Peace,
Scott
