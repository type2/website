Subject: Re: [T2] Re: towing capacity

You've got that right. I have a VW trike that has a tow bar that can be
attached to it, and becomes a trailer I can pull behind my bus. The worst
part of it is the braking, the drum brakes, never the best in the first
place, really have a time dealing with that extra weight pushing on them.
Maybe I should update to disks one of these days.

It's not only the engine that determines towing capacity.  Your brakes are
typically the limiting factor and also the clutch plays a part.  The owner's
manual for my 1969 Kombi rates its towing capacity at 1100 lbs. with a 100
lb.
tongue weight.
