Subject: Re: [T2] is my mechanic full of it? (hot start/cold start
  problem)

If the starter turns the engine over fine with the screwdriver trick,
then you DO have a voltage issue.

See, all the ignition switch does is exactly what you did with the
screwdriver. But if the wiring from the starter to the switch, or the
switch itself, is degrading and providing more resistance than
necessary the starter may not receive enough voltage at the solenoid
to trigger the process. The relay removes all that from consideration.
All the ignition switch does after the relay is installed is trigger
the relay. The relay provides the switching of power to the solenoid.

-Will the hot start relay from BD fix it? Almost certainly.
-Will a new starter fix it? Possibly, but only because a fresh rebuild
may be less sensitive to the voltage drop. It may last the life of the
starter, or it may start screwing up again in a week or two.
-Is there another fix? Yes. You could rewire your bus.

Obviously it's up to you. Personally, I'd let the guy put the starter
in (or do it myself... I just did mine and it was a breeze once I
figured out the stupid half moon bolt..heh I didn't even have to jack
up the bus!) and then order the relay from BD. You get the best of
both worlds that way.

BTW: I only paid $50 at Kragen (Checker) for mine.
