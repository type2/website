Hi,

I am considering purchasing a roof rack from a list member who is just
outside the beltline in Northern Virginia. Is anyone traveling from that
area and heading south thru North Carolina that could haul it south for me?
The roof rack is a half length VoA all metal rack and should fit a top a
splittie or baywindow bus. Althogh I am in Greensboro, NC I can meet you in
anywhere in North Carolina. I would go and get it myself but Michele is due
to give birth to our second child and I need to stay close to home for now.
