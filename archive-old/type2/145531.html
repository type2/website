Subject: Backfiring on decel

Situation: recent full rebuild on a 1600 DP. 
Symptom:  loud exhaust and backfiring on
deceleration.  It is otherwise very smooth, no
vibrations at idle or at speed.  It doesn't
backfire when revved in neutral etc.  Exhaust is
still loud.  No smoke etc from the exhaust.  (But
I haven't readjusted the carb due to the exhaust
leak.)  

I attempted to tighten down the exhaust, but it
doesn't seem to be working.  I don't see any
signs of exhaust leakage around the gaskets.  My
other concern are loose heads or studs.  

Whatduhyathink?

Happy bussin'
