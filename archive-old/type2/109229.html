Subject: Heat/Sound Insulation

Hi all,

Things are progressing on my 2.0 rebuild, but we've had nice weather finally
return to the Northeast so the engine isn't getting as much attention as my
house at the moment ;) Special thanks to Nikki down in the southwest for
helping me with some used parts for my 72-74 exhaust conversion!

I just wanted to let you know I picked up a client here at work that may be
of interest to those of us on the list. I'm a PR guy so appoligies for
throwing this out there, but I am definately going to use this stuff when it
comes time to clean up the engine compartment.

The new client is Lydall, which is a company that makes a ton of stuff for
the auto industry, but they have just started selling their heat and sound
insualtion materials to the public though their website. I'm not going to
waste space spaming on product definitions, but if you're looking to replace
or enhance the old insulation that is in your engine compartment you may
want to visit www.CoolandQuiet_dot_com and see if anything floats your boat.

Sorry again for the pitch, but then again I know it's an issue!

And if you ever think you got it bad... you should check out my other car,
er truck, I drive. I have a 61 Ford Econoline truck, which is a cab over
between the seats and let me tell you, that is a HOT engine. LOL
