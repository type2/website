I have  a 78 Bus with a dealer installed A/C unit. (yes it works, PO had =
it all rebuilt) )..The compressor is on the left side of my engine compar=
tment, The problem is , there is a hole around the compressor. I have tho=
ught about cutting sheet metal but what a nightmare. What about a metal t=
ape ? Anyone use metal tape in there engine compartment ? It seems like i=
t would form fit around perfectly.  And seal great. Or does this sound ju=
st to Mickey Mouse. =20
