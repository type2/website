Subject: Re: [T2] customer service by Bus Depot

My own Bus Depot story:

I bought a complete exhaust system from Bus depot in anticipation of
changing out my engine.  The boxes were put on the shelf and, like many
projects, the changeout was put off for several months.  When I opened the
boxes, I found that the tailpipe bracket and installation kit had been
omitted from the shipment.  I emailed Ron about it and the parts were in
my hand within days.

Considering that several months had passed and that I had failed to notice
the omission when I received the shipment, Bus Depot could have simply
said &quot;too late, too bad&quot; and been justified in doing so.  Instead, they
corrected the error immediately and at their expense.

The originator of this thread has a legitmate concern, but I'm wondering
why it was necessary to being it to the list at this point.  If
negotiations were at an impasse it might be justified, but in this case
communication seems to be ongoing.

Any transactions made from afar are likely to result in a glitch now and
then, and I'm sure that this glitch will be worked out.  The chances of a
amiable solution are reduced, however, by premature complaints to a
public forum.
