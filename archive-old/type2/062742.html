It's definitely Friday here, although I haven't checked which direction the
flush is running today...

It's a beautiful,clear sunny day, the bus is running well.  I tried the
dipstick test last night after going out just for the crack....and I could
hold it quite comfortably...I take a degree of comfort from this...

Good to be here !
