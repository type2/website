Subject: type 2 (002, 091) transmission rebuilding

List:
There has recently been some talk of transmission rebuilding and the
tools needed.
I have rebuilt many 002 and 091's and just one 091/1 (in my wife's
silver 87 Vanagon). 
I'm no stranger to rebuilding manual transmissions having given myself a
baptism of fire when I was 16. I did have about 3 good mentors to call
up in case I got into trouble.
I NEVER had any special tools (and never had one fail!) till I did the
87 one nearly five years ago. I figured I'd never find another core in
the midwest, so I'd better not bugger up that one.
There ARE NO GOOD BOOKS available to the common man. The Bentley is the
best you will find (but there are mistakes in it in the 091/1 section),
the German Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesselshaft is better. There is probably
stuff on microfiche at the dealer. It really helps if you understand the
function of the transmission completely.
Theoretically the only tools you need are:
1. special socket for the pinion bearing lock nut. I have removed these
with a tapered punch (intact) or a dremel and cutting wheel (to destroy)
A new part is less than $20 and a good idea. Installing is the harder
task. Books say to torque to 160 ft-lbs and then undo and retorque. I
doubt it makes any difference whether it is 140 ft-lbs or 300 ! (mortal
men will probably not strip those threads!) The special socket WILL slip
and scare the hell out of you, however, if you are not applying about
100 lbs force holding it on! VW381/14 (vw says $456.00, i'm sure I only
paid $50 or so.
2. Holding fixture to hold the transaxle case and resist said 160ft-lbs
force. A chain vise might work here, but I had a local machine shop make
me a nice copy of the factory tool (VW352 $199.20) that will fit into my
HD AMERICAN ENGINE (HEAVY) engine stand. Cost $160
3. Fixture and special socket to remove the first (?)(senior moment
here) gear race which must be removed to replace the pinion bearing
(double tapered roller with the threads on one end which the lock nut in
(1) above locks onto). Also need to remove if replacing 1st gear syncro
ring or hub assembly or 1st gear. (That's about all of them!)
$220 maybe and only made by Matra, Germany.
4. Fixture for setting position of forks. I've never had one of these
(091/1's don't need em), I always scribe the old parts and they've
always have worked, but this is a weak point in my process and very time
consuming and I'd really like to buy a factory tool. VW294/b factory
price $1576.60 (How do they come up with those numbers?)
An alternative would be to get a second (junk) case and sawzall some
windows into it.
5. The special socket that allows you to screw in the side gear cup
holders (which position the differential sideways setting its lash and
also the bearing preload). Oddly enough the Bentley shows how to make
these from the early sheet metal lock plates. I've jammed things into
these and run them most of the way in, finishing off with a carefully
dulled chisel.
6. Dial indicators and special fixtures to hold them. I have dials and
magnetic bases and can usually rig something up.
7. Transmission gear carrier press fixture (VW456A $321.70) nice to
have, but I made one out of 3 2x4's that works.
Bugpack allegedly makes plastick replicas of parts 4 and 5 and they are
probably good enough.
The really sad thing is, EVERY dealer had this stuff at one time, most
of these are now in landfills after spring cleaning! (Few had the need
or inclination to use them, however.)
Many other tools are nice: a hydraulic press 15-20 tons is almost a
necessity, snap ring pliers (heavy) and circlip pliers.
I have an electric hot plate and a saucepan of atf to heat a few pieces
to make them slip fit without pressing, but it's slow.		
Theoretically you don't need to set the pinion depth (shims) unless you
change the ring and pinion or the case.
Put everything back exactly where it was, (shims and snap rings -they
are different thicknesses), work methodically, draw sketches or take
pictures.
That's about it, not much harder than a Ford top loader AND a Ford rear
axle, but way different.
Oh, by the way, Rick Long, Long Enterprises, Sebastapol, CA, sells
parts, some tools, and knows more about VW transaxles than perhaps
anyone else on earth (in their stock emulations, anyway). I do not know
1 percent of what he knows.
