Subject: Re: [T2] anyone in st.pete, fl ???

    If you can manage the trip to Tampa, go check out Fisher Buggies. Those
guys are some of the coolest guys around. They have a big showroom and a
funny car! As far as St Pete goes, I never could find a place better than
Fisher when I lived there. Of course, I lived there over 5 yrs ago and it
appears the Fisher website is down. Maybe they are not around anymore? Good
luck!
    Also, Orlando has a couple of awesome junkyards in you can make the trip
there. One is called A1 and they had tons of old buses when I lived there.

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;if there is anyone in the st.pete, fl area
that can help a sistah out in finding a decent place
around here for purchasing parts&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
