Subject: RE: [T2] Weber tuning- low power uphill

Dual 40 IDFs on a 1776 with 041s 110cam, Monza exhuast (getting changed
when the header arrives).
009 dizzy with dwell at 55-56, timed dynamically to 32 total, coming in
right after 2600rpm range.
HAD a 34 pict that was dying on it, but I had barely decent hill
climbing with the 34 with the same dizzy settings. I was after changin
one thing at a time.
Valves are set at .006 with swivel feet, boy those are harder to check
than stock.
Thanks,
Al

tuning- low power uphill


&gt;Where should I look first in a low power uphill situation?
&gt;Restricted fuel delviery? I just installed 40 idf and am working 
&gt;out the tuning.

You left out 3 really important pieces of information if you want help
with this.  
  1. What type engine (upright or type IV)?  
  2. What size engine (1600, 1.7, 1.8, 2.0, other)?  
  3. You didn't make it clear if you installed a single 40IDF or a pair
of them.  

Dual 40's when properly set up will give you plenty of power both off
the line and on the top end.  Post the missing info and you'll no doubt
receive some useful input.
