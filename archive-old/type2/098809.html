I was once actually pulled over for speeding in my bus. Ok, so it wasn't on the 
highway, it was 48 in a 35 on a frontage road. The cop was lurking under an 
overpass and I was in a hurry to get to the freeway. I didn't even need traffic 
school though, he let me go with a fix it ticket for my missing front lisence 
plate and declined to give me another for my badly cracked windshield.
