&gt; &gt; one little irony, the core charge and what it will cost me to return the
&gt; &gt; core is about the same,.....but that is the shippers fault not Bus Depot
&gt;
&gt; Hmmm. http://busdepot_dot_com/catalog.jsp?model=57&amp;category=13&amp;group=83 says no
&gt; core on any of the starters they list.

this is a Bosch rebuilt starter and there was a core charge listed on the
webpage for this starter, it was not unexpected it was clearly listed on
the site.

&gt; And since return shipping doesn't have to be expedited how much is regular
&gt; USPS shipping -- non-priority?

haven't priced it but starters are heavy
