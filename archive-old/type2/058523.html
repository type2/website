Subject: CV boots

In the last couple of weeks someone mentioned that there is an 
unpredictable variation in the quality of CV boot rubber. Since then I 
have noticed that there are a suprising number of intact boots on wrecks 
at pick-n-pulls. I wonder whether it wouldn't be just as cheap to buy 
whole shafts with good boots, repack the boots, and swap shafts as to buy 
new boots? According to the law of averages, the CV joint on a shaft in a 
junkyard with a good boot on it is likely to be in better shape than my 
CV joints with their busted boots, no?
