Subject: RE: Looking for Bondo in all the wrong places

Hi David,

	As several people have already posted, a magnet is generally the preferred
method for finding filler.  For extra style points, try a magnetic stud
finder like this one http://shop.store.yahoo_dot_com/tmt/tmt47400brfo.html.
They can be found at just about any home center for less than 10 bucks.  By
holding it so that the axis of the magnet will swing vertically you have a
great tool for identifying any areas with more than a skim coat of filler.
When you get to an area with filler, the magnet tips skyward (thank you
gravity).  Low tech, hard to dispute evidence.  As an added bonus you can
use it to find studs in your house when you are done.

To protect the prospective vehicles paint, stick a small piece of felt on
the back side, then just slide it all over any areas that look less than
perfect.

						Good luck,

&lt;How do I identify areas where filler has been used (incorrectly)?  I know
it has legitimate uses, I'm talking about big gaping voids in quarter
panels, rocker panels, and noses that have been filled.&gt;
