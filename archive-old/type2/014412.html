Subject: No A/C on '71 Westy

&gt; I recently purchased a '71 Westy 2 weeks ago so its
&gt; been sitting in my driveway while I get it road
ready.
&gt; I have the extension cord running to it so I could
&gt; have my 9&quot; t.v. out there so I could watch the news
&gt; while working on it. It's been working great until
&gt; last night when I unplugged it to move it. I plugged
&gt; it back in and had no juice. First I checked the
&gt; extension cord--it was plugged in and was giving
&gt; power.
&gt; I then hit the reset button on the outlet--it
clicked
&gt; but I am still not getting any power. Does anybody
&gt; know what happened or what to check??
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; BK
