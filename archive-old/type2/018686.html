&gt; Hi List,
&gt; 
&gt;         Quick and hopefully easy question here.  In the process of my
&gt; engine rebuild, and we're replacing the bearings on the crankshaft, and we
&gt; came across this sentence in the book we are referencing:
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;An important part of VW connecting rod service is replacing the rod nuts.
&gt; _Always use new rod nuts_ for maximum strength and accurate torque
&gt; readings.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt;         The book we're using is &quot;How to Rebuild You VW Air-Cooled Engine&quot;,
&gt; by Tom Wilson.
&gt; 
&gt;         We never would have replaced them, and are wondering if it is
&gt; really necessary.  And if it is necessary, does anyone know where we can
&gt; get the nuts for a 1974, Type 4, 1800cc engine?
&gt; 
&gt;         Thanks guys,
&gt; 
&gt;           Wade
Wade:
I personally don't believe it. The nuts are much less prone to failure
that the bolts, and I don't believe even the bolts are in line to fail
in such a lightly stressed motor. Race cars, turbines, aircraft are in
another category than 100 hp or less type 4 motors.
