Subject: Re: [T2] Removing the rear axle nut

In a message dated 1/17/04 7:27:06 PM, slyons_at_netrover_dot_com writes:

&lt;&lt; Get a cheap (harbour freight or similar) 46mm socket and weld it to a 48&quot;
piece of 1&quot; x 2&quot; rectangular tube. It will never break, and you will never
have a problem removing or torqueing the axle nut again. Weld a 36mm socket
on the other side of the tube and you have a gland nut and bug axle nut tool
also.

Yard sale finds # ...

Bought a box of a half dozen two foot long box wrenches at a yard
sale with round handles...No markings or names on 'em so I have
no idea where or what they're for (my guess would be either trucks
or commercial plumbing...) Just luck, but one of 'em fits the 46 mm
nut...Great for removing the nut and saving the 1/2 inch drive socket
for retorqueing... ;-)
