Subject: Re: [T2] Bleeding Brakes

 On Thu May 24  9:46 , &quot;Alan Beck&quot;  sent:

&gt;I was told to put the wheel back on the vehicle, have someone pump up the
&gt;brakes and open the valve, the person pumping them up then  holds the pedal
&gt;to the bottom, I close the valve, they pump it up again and so on.
&gt;Also I need to monitor the brake fluid reservoir carefully as I could allow
&gt;air into the system.
&gt;So, why do you need the wheel on the vehicle again?


Alan,, you really don't need the &quot;wheel&quot; in place,, if fact i prefer to have
the wheel off.. it allows easier access to the bleeder without having to be
completely under the vehicle.

you MUST have the &quot;drum&quot; in place,, or ----the caliper on the rotor in the
case of disc brakes.

The piston in the wheel cylinder,, or the piston in the caliper is going to
move and MUST not be able to come right out ...

so the drum and the brake shoes must be in place to bleed brakes while pumping
on the brake pedal


hope that helps
