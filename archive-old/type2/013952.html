&gt; Anyone interested in a trade?
&gt;
&gt; Til then, how do you get the instrument cluster out of
&gt; a 68? The (currently useless) heating knobs are in the
&gt; way.

Heater knobs are held in by plastic rivets behind panel.  You can see them
through the radio hole.  Some have had luck with removing these rivits
without damaging them.  Not me.  No matter, once the rivets are gone, the
knobs pull straight out.  don't lose the flat springs that hold the levers
in place and prevent rattles.  These springs are sufficient to hold the
levers in place without rivets.
