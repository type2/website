Joe,
If the antiseize compound were electrically insulating the threads of the 
temp sensors, would the resistance not be higher that 4000 ohms rather than 
lower, like maybe infinite? So what you are reading is probably o.k. given 
that the spec is set for 68 degrees F, which we may not see for a few more 
months!
