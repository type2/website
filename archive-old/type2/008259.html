&gt; Volks,
&gt; While back on this forum, I asked about mufflers, for 1500 engine, &amp; 
&gt; people told me German made was the way to go, so finally today I go
to a
&gt; couple of my VW parts suppliers and they both tell me, you can't buy
German
&gt; made anymore.  They were wanting to sell me Brazillian ones.

Simple, most people shop for price, so the cheaper Brazilian mufflers
have pushed the German parts from your supplier's shelves.  It's too
costly to stock parts for which there is low demand.

Since he doesn't stock German mufflers anymore, he can't sell them to
you.  He therefore tells you a &quot;fib&quot;, saying that German mufflers
aren't available, in the hope that you'll jump on the Brazilian cheapo
bandwagen and give him some business.

The solution is to change suppliers.  I just got a nice Leisteritz
muffler, made in May of 1998, complete with &quot;Made in Germany&quot; stamped
into the metal.

(Hmmm: Why does a German company stamp that in English?)

I got it from Bus Depot, and the price wasn't bad at all.  Once you've
wrestled a Mexican or Brazilian muffler into position you will be more
than willing to go to the trouble to find the correct German part! 
The difference in quality and fit is amazing!
