&lt;&lt; I would suggest using some urethane glass sealant.  Check with your local 
windshied installation place, and ask them if they will lay a bead around 
your windshield seal.  Perhaps they will even sell you a tube.  Home Depot 
may even sell the stuff, but I haven't checked to see.

Ask your local body mam where he gets his supplies...Finishmasters is
one in my locale...
