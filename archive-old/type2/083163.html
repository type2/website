Subject: Re: [T2] bumpers and Weber 32/36 Progressive carb settup for sale at Everybus!!!

Hello,

I was waiting for someone to ask me that. The hardest
part of this conversion to me was removing the
&quot;extension&quot; pannel at the bottom of the nose of my
bus. I ended up using an air chisel, hammer, flat
screw driver and a rotary disc cutter. i hade to take
it off in pieces seperating it from the bus at its
welede points. I cleaned and straitened all of the
edges and painted the inner pannel behind the
&quot;extension&quot; with rust converting paint (a desperate
attempt to ease my mind about some rust holes I found
behind it). I ordered The Lower Front Nose Panel for
use when installing late nose w/ 68-72 bumper , 68-72
Bus. The price was $24.95 and the part # waw 95 55
220. Just be sure not to cut off the lip that sticks
out behind the top of the front bumper. This is
important so you can &quot;easily&quot; weld on the replacement.
I cut if off and had to weld it on the HARD way. Make
sure that you align everything up several times before
you start welding.  Having more than a half dozen vice
grips also helps. Go to this link and you will find
pictures of my progress on the nose so far. There are
also pictures of a dash board. I striped the dash of
its padding, striped the paint off and welded sheet
metal patches in the unwanted holes. There is no hole
for the radio now but I will cut one if I ever put one
in it. I fixed the flaws and primed it. I plan to
paint it Bright gloss white.

Let me know if this link works. Have a great day!

What are you doing for the
&gt; front assembly? The &quot;extension&quot; at the lower
&gt; front of the 73-79 prevents the bumper from
&gt; sitting as close to the body as the 68-72...
