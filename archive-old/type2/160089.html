ok, I think I am missing the obvious here :)

so be patient til I get this into my brain hehe

this is what I bought from a scrap place ( for too much I've since found out
)

and

( Thank you cip1 )

Now, I don't have an assembled motor to work from as an example, and none of
my books are shoing me what I need

This assembly is supposed to mount sideways? That means I am missing a
bracket of some sort?

Anyone have any pictures of the assembly on a motor?

Thanks!
