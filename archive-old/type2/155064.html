Subject: Re: [T2] Hankook RA08 Report

&gt; I'm interested in how much sidewall flex / how harsh 
&gt; the ride with the Hankook &quot;D&quot; ratings compared with 
&gt; say, the Cooper or Goodrich load range &quot;C&quot; tires. 

&gt; &gt; Tire Supplier (Les Schwab). They felt and looked 
&gt; &gt; unsafe. Based upon the tire load numbers and the 
&gt; &gt; weight of the vehicle, the 2-ply tires WERE unsafe. 

I have an experience I can share, i recently went to Les Schwab and bought 6 ply tires with an aggressive tread 1 size bigger than what was on there, I thought I would be giving up quiet tires going from the 2 plys that were on it when I bought the bus, it improved in every imaginable way, quieter, better handling, my speedometer is correct, and it serves as my ORV now.

Les Schwab can't get an 8 ply light truck tire anymore they said, but the 6 plys I bought certainly made my life much better.

BTW, I destroyed a tire driving along the Siletz River, I didn't have many choices in Newport, Oregon on a Saturday and I didn't want to buy 1 new 2 ply tire.

Thanks,

James
