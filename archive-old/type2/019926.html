&gt;&quot;Ah, yes, the dreaded &quot;PUNISHMENT COT&quot;.  I removed and stored mine.  &gt;Has
&gt;any adult amongst us actually slept in one of these?  Have you &gt;recovered
&gt;from it?&quot;
&gt; 
&gt;Back some years ago, my second bus, a 71 rustfalia, had one of these.
&gt;I was on a trip from Minneapolis to Chicago to see the Dead.  My wife
&gt;and I got the downstairs bed, my wifes short girlfriend got the
&gt;childs cot, and  265 lb 6' tall Football buddie got the upstairs cot.
&gt;Middle of the first night camping, a terrible noise awakens us all
&gt;and a giant rump was hanging out of a rended 25 year old canvas cot.
&gt;Quite the scene!
&gt;
