&gt; the performance? What literally happened inside the engine when I hooked up

&gt; everything?

James, (and the rest of you, too :-)

Back a bit, Sean was having some problems with his vacuum brake booser,
and I wrote up a test procedure for him.  If the booster is working
correctly, it should have no noticable effect on the engine, but if it is
leaking, it will cause big problems.  Use the following procedure to check
yours.

Vacuum brake booster test procedure.

Thing you need:
vacuum guage
cap for vacuum port on the intake manifold
friend to work brake pedal
pencil and paper

Procedure:

Hook up the vac guage.  Start the engine.  Note the reading.  This is your
&quot;base&quot; reading.

Stop the engine, disconnect the booster vacuum line and cap the port on
the manifold. Start the engine, look at the guage.  If this reading is
substantally higher than the base, you have a leak in the system, probably
in the lines leading to the booster. 

stop the engine, remove and test the one-way valve (should be able to blow
into it one way but not the other, air should only pass in the direction
indicated by the arrow printed on the top of the valve (make sure to
reinstall it in the correct direction)

reconnect the one way valve and vacuum line to the manifold, start the
engine. watch the vac guage as a friend depresses the brake pedal.  It
should dip as the pedal is depressed and return to the base reading.  If
it drops slowly, but returns, you have a blockage/collapse in the vac
line.  If it falls and does not return, you have a torn diaphram in the
booster.  Especially indicative of a torn diaphram is a hissing when the
pedal is depressed)

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
