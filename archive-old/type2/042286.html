&gt; 2. Distributor question: pull the wires and loosen the adjuster
&gt; bolt and the distributor comes out. Is there any way I can install
&gt; it (after new points, condenser) wrong? In other words, can it
&gt; go back in only one way? 1971 Westy

If you loosen the bolt of the adjuster clamp, you will have to retime your
engine when you put it back in. It's less work to just loosen the nut that
holds the clamp to the engine block, allowing you to pull the dizzy _with_
the clamp.
