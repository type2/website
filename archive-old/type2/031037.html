&gt; The title line pretty much says it, I just got my 77 van running

&gt; switch the automatic transmission to either neutral or park the idle speed
&gt; goes up several hundred RPM.  Why is this?  

Auto tranny engines have a small idle valve that reduces the idle while in
neutral (torque converters have a certain amount of drag) I rarely see one
of these that work and usually just split the difference in the RPM
ranges, as long as you can still shift smoothly you probably will not have
a problem, or grab the Bentley book, (IIRC) in the auto tranny addendum
there is info on how to adjust the idle valve if you want to work on it, I
have never seen the parts avaliable so that is part of the problem.
