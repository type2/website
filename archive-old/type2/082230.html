&gt;My pal Roy had a similar problem that came and went.  We discovered 
&gt;to our surprise that a bent dizzy clamp was keeping the dizzy from 
&gt;fully seating in the drive gear.. Although I do not really understand 
&gt;how this caused an intermittent firing problem on one cylinder, it 
&gt;did. The problem promptly disappeared when the dizzy was fully seated.

I had this problem when I first zipped everything up.  I was getting ready to 
hit the road for Full Moon in Joon and it was missing REALLY BAD.  Whacked 
the distributor down till it was fully seated and there ya go.  I'll revisit 
this, however.
