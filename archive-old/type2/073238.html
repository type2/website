Big thanks to Ron and his people at The Bus Depot for the stellar service
I've received from them lately. I placed a big order a while back, but only
received part of it - some things I got two of. Ron's people were very
friendly and got that problem cleared up quickly.

Ron was kind enough to let me exchange the '78 exhaust parts I had
purchased for the '72-'74 equivalents - I'm replacing the entire
exhaust/heater box system and I decided to go with the earlier setup after
reading Ron's article in the Library at www.type2_dot_com. I shipped the old
stuff back on Wednesday night, and got the new stuff yesterday. Great
turnaround!

Thanks guys!
