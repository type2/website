  and Website

The first owner of my 78 put on 50,000 km between 78 and 80 - at that rate 
my bus would have 725,000 kms on it ... however, the second owner of my 78 
only put on 50,000 between 1980 and ... 2002 or so ... I really appreciate 
the fact that he did only drive it occasionally. I'm not sad for my bus at 
all ... I'm happy I was able to find such a low mileage bus .....

&gt; I feel sad for it too.  I guess it isn't a way of life to everyone though. 
&gt; I bet those honda racer types that zip around the neighborhood think the 
&gt; same thing about my 'classic 1994 civic' that sits in the driveway on all 
&gt; but the coldest days.
