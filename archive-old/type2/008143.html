&gt;I just got a '76 Westy ('Deluxe' says the for sale sign in the window, 
but
&gt;I'm not really sure how to determine if it really is or not).  

Hey Ian,

Congrats on the new purchase. The Westphalia Deluxe came with the 
propane cookstove and electric fridge, while the non-deluxe did not.  
The non-deluxe only had a sink and icebox.  I have the Westphalia owners 
manual for my '79 deluxe, but I can't find it right at the moment.  I 
think the deluxe may have also had the swivel front passenger seat, but 
I'm not sure.  Take care.

Randall
