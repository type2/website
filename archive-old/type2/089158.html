To all those around the Southeast, the VW club I belong to here in =
Birmingham Alabama is putting on a show on September 22nd. We had over =
100 vehicles last year and are looking to grow this year. ALL VW's are =
welcome and I think a couple of 914's will be there, PLUS you get a =
chance to see the DEATH BUS in action.
