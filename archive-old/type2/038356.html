Subject: Re: muffler noise

&gt; OK here is the run down on what  is going on with my 77 2L FI bus.
&gt;
&gt; 1. All new ignition system, coil, plugs, 009, and wires. Timing and dwell
&gt; are dead on.

Sorry, Brett, but with an 009, your timing will only be dead on at idle. You
need the advance curve of the distributor that originally came with your
bus, in particular one with vacuum advance.

&gt; So I am still plagued with some back fire, I am now being told that the
type
&gt; of muffler (four tip chrome) could be the cause of the back fire. Can any

You may still have an exhaust leak somewhere.
