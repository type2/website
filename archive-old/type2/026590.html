Subject: Re: Type I Engine Pull, frozen pilot bearing?
Date: Mon, 26 Oct 1998 11:53:32 -0600

&gt;If I can get another body here tomorrow we'll try your way of moving 
&gt;the crank but I am not optimistic. Any other opinions before I try 
&gt;opening the trans?

Before downing the bus, would the clutch disengage at all?  When my
pilot bearing went out, I was getting some slipping (ie. the shaft was
turning some, just not freely within the end of the crank.)  If it
wasn't locked up solid you should be able to pull it right off.  I
didn't have any trouble pulling my engine off the shaft at all.

I know you guys have tried all this already, but, well, here it is
anyway.  Maybe it isn't hanging on the pilot bearing like you think.
Maybe it's something else.  

Is there some way the throwout bearing has become stuck fast to the
pressure plate?  If so, the clutch release arm would move if you were to
re-mate the engine and tranny.  Weird, I know, but maybe?

Is the engine at the proper elevation and angle so it's not binding?
Don't hit me for this next one, but are all 4 nuts/bolts that hold the
engine to the tranny off?  Did you remove the starter (I know you don't
have to, but it's easy and would at least eliminate that possibility)?
You did remove all such things as throttle cable, heater box hoses and
cables, brake vacuum connection, gas line, electricals, etc.?

I'm not familiar with how the type2 motors are installed in the loaf
buses, but have you double and triple checked that the engine bar or
whatever is out of the way and free to move and that the sheet metal
itself isn't in the way and binding on the engine compartment?

I know, I know, these are all real basic things and I don't mean to
insult your intelligence, but sometimes it's easy to miss something
(like reversing #2 and #4 plug wires in my case) and you're so sure it's
right that you don't even bother to check it.
