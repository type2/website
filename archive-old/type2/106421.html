Subject: Sliding Window Gaskets

Hey guys,

	I just ordered a set of sliding windows from Busted Bus. However,
they didn't have the gaskets for it. I ordered a set gaskets from Westburg
West and they assured me that the solid bus window gaskets were the same as
the ones used for the sliding windows. Is this true?

Thanks,
