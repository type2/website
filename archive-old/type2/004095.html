Subject: air control flaps and wire to them???

I just fired up my newly acquired 79 Westy, and while reconnecting all the
emissions stuff the PO had undone, I noticed what appears to be a
springloaded &quot;bar&quot; that runs across the engine from side to side just on the
rear of the distributor (rear as in rear of bus). It looks like it had a
wire going to it at some time, much like a throttle cable wire. It is
missing now, just a bit of it's end remains, and I can't figure where it
would have run too. Any ideas??
Thanks,
Courtney
