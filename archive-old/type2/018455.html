            If you checked out that page that was posted a few days ago
for the stainless mufflers, they also had some very, very nice oil
coolers, filters, and thermo-switches for the oil. They said put the oil
fiter ahead of the oil cooler -- for just the reason you just stated. It
would also keep the cooler cleaner as well.
