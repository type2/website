Hi all, I'm still researching where, when &amp; how my bus conversion took place, but in the meantime--I need some help on some things that are probably real simple (but not to me!).

The sink in my bus doesn't work.  I'm assuming it is an electric pump because from what I can see (&amp;  it's not much) there is a blue cylindrical &quot;something&quot; with wires coming out of it.  Can someone please explain to me (as if I was a 12 year old) how the whole mechanism works, any diagrams, etc.?  I've read the archives but unfortunately I'm starting from scratch knowledge-wise &amp; know nothing about electricity, voltage, etc., so after reading the info, I still don't understand.  If it is electric, does it run off the battery, or do I have to have an electrical hookup? Boy I'm greeeeeeeeeeeeen!  But I really want to learn to do things for myself...

 I also tried putting water in the receptacle on top of the sink, &amp; the water flows straight through the to the bottom of the bus &amp; out--Can anyone tell me what type of replacement cap I need for the tank?

I also just put a maintenance-free battery in, is it cool to listen to the stereo at a camp out, &amp; how long before I get into trouble? (she bows her head shamefully...)

After you've picked yourselves off the floor from laughing so hard, help a poor  (usually very intelligent) gal learn....
Thanks!
