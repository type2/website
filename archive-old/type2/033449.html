Subject: Sliding Door

We just had our bottom track replaced in our 70 bus. Ours was doing the
exact same thing you describe. Our door would also fall out if you
didn't hold it up. We took a saws all saw and cut out the area where the
slider is from an old bus and took it to a body shop and had them weld
it in our bus. They cut out our old rusted part,  welded in the newer
one we gave them, and primed and painted the door and adjoining panels
for $500. They did a very nice job. My husband and I were very happy
with it.

Don't know if you need the same thing done but just wanted to let you
know what it cost us.

Sharon
