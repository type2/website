     I've been noticing on my screens on the jalousie windows that there
is quite a gap between the screen and the frame -- big enough for a good
sized moth to crawl through, which is how I first noticed it. More than
enough for misquito to get in. Is there supposed to be a rubber seal
there or something? I was thinking of trying to squirt silicone caulk or
something in there.
