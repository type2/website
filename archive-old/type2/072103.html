&gt;went to the bus to start her up when I noticed a small puddle of water on
&gt;both sides of the front floor under my rubber matts.

Hi Todd,
This is usually caused by the water running down your door windows past the
scrapers and into the door, then it runs out by the seat base and onto the
floor.  If the plastic sheeting is present and correct behind your inner
door panels, the water should pass harmlessly out through the holes in the
door bottoms by the step, so if you have never had the panels off, now is
the time to check.

&gt;wondering if there are seals for the accelerator rod going thru the floor
&gt;and the E-brake handle as mine does not have any.

Yes there are seals here but if you have water coming in through these
holes you should really think about getting a boat instead of a VW.  Or get
the best of both worlds and buy a schwimmwagen.
