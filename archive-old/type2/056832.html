HOW WE SPENT OUR SUMMER VACATION
By George, Marie, Claire, and Tempest
Part 3 of 4, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas

Edgemont, SD
Hot Springs, SD
We headed for Hot Springs on a whim and it turned out to be a lot of
fun.  We found a great place to stay (the Historic Log Cabin Motel), a
&quot;auto camp&quot; dating from the ^Ñ20s.  The proprietors have a small
menagerie of birds and animals that delighted the kids and stacks of
toys and bicycles that guests are welcome to use.  The deck affords a
great view of Hot Springs.  The big disappointment of Hot Springs is
that there really isn^Òt a _hot_ spring there.  There are several warm
springs though, and back before the turn of the century someone got the
idea of building a swimming pool around the springs and the result has
grown and is still in use to this day.  The Evans Plunge is kind of an
odd pool, with a gravel bottom (needed to allow the spring water to
enter the pool) and an edge that is four feet above the surface of the
water.  It is completely enclosed to allow use year-round.  Water
temperature is in the high 80s.  There are a couple of water slides
available, including one nasty one that simply drops you 20 feet and
sends you skittering across the water at what feels like Warp 9.  Yow! 
The girls were in hog heaven!  There were also traveling rings, various
floats, and even some large fiberglass alligators to play with.  None of
this stuff would be available in my home state, as the tort lawyers
would have sued the place out of existence.  Perhaps South Dakota (and
Wyoming, for that matter) has a hunting season for the taking of lawyers
or something!  Later on, Marie and the girls found an outfitter south of
town and took a horseback ride in the nearby hills.  We also visited the
city museum, housed in the original schoolhouse high on a hill.  North
of town, there is a reservoir (cold creek) that has camping and a nice
swimming beach.

Oelrichs, SD
Chadron, NE
Heading south on US385 into Nebraska, the land flattened out.  Really
flat.  No trees.  What^Òs that joke about the state tree of Nebraska
being the telephone pole?  South of Chadron, and just north of the
Niobrara river I saw a yard filled with familiar shapes.  About 20 or so
VWs of all descriptions filled a large yard next to a house.  Nobody
seemed to be home (darn!), so we moved on.  Just south of here we were
waved down by a highway worker who told us that they had just oiled the
road ahead.  He suggested that we take a handy dirt road for a few miles
to avoid the oil and gravel.  Having picked up too many gravel chips in
the windshield, I gratefully accepted his advice.

Alliance, NE
Letan, NE
Angora, NE
Northport, NE
Broadwater, NE
Lisco, NE
Oshkosh, NE
We switched to US26, and  followed the North Platte River for quite a
ways.  This is the route of the Oregon trail, and you can see why the
pioneers liked this route.  The land was flat, water and feed were
plentiful, and the direction of the river was pretty much the direction
that they wanted to go.  Most of these towns were little more than a
grain elevator and a few surrounding buildings.  Oshkosh was a bit
livelier, though.

Lewellan, NE
We wanted to stay here, and there was a nice little motel, but there
wasn^Òt anyplace to eat.  This seems to be a common occurrence in the
Midwest.  Almost every town has abandoned motels, restaurants, etc.  The
cause of this seems to be the increasing mechanization and consolidation
of farms.  There simply isn^Òt the need to have as many people on the
land, so there is a correspondingly lesser need for the services the
towns used to provide.  Unlike the Nevada ghost towns I^Òm familiar with,
this process didn^Òt take place rapidly, but over a number of years. 
Businesses just died as their clientele dried up.  The result is that
there might be a motel or restaurant hanging on here or there, but so
far apart that the traveler can^Òt find or patronize both.  It^Òs pretty
sad to see, but a fact of life if you follow the thin lines on the map.

Ogallala, NE
Found a place on the north end of town (away from the ever-present
railroad tracks) that was quite inexpensive.  It even had a much
welcomed pool!.  Most of the other guests were railroad workers doing
some sort of emergency track repair work.  We didn^Òt see much of them as
they had to leave for their job site at 3:30AM.  Talk about
Oh-Dark-Thirty!  From Ogallala we went south on NE61.

Grant, NE
Imperial, NE
Enders, NE
Wauneta, NE
Culbertson, NE
McCook, NE
We dropped down and followed the Frenchman River on US6.  This river has
a lot of meanders, and we lost track of how many times we crossed over
it.  From McCook, we headed south on US83

Cedar Bluffs, KS
Oberlin, KS
Reagar, KS
Going down US36, we passed by a town called &quot;Lyle&quot;.  Didn^Òt go up the
gravel road to see it as I had done so a few years ago and found that it
only had four buildings and no businesses at all.  I^Òve been to two of
the four towns bearing my name in the US and Lyle, WA is far livelier. 
Kinda of strange seeing my name on everything in town.

Norton, KS
Hill City, KS
Kansas is kind of like Nebraska, except that it isn^Òt quite as
mountainous.  The state tree is the radio antenna.  From Norton we
headed south on US283.

WaKeeney, KS
Don^Òt you hate it when people put unneeded capital letters in the middle
of their names?  Kind of makes me thing that they^Òre trolling for
attention, like RuPaul.  Seems even worse when a city does it!

Trego Center, KS
Ness City, KS
At Ness City, we stopped for gas and inquired about lodging.  Seems that
the Derrick Inn was the only place in town.  Although the appellation
&quot;inn&quot; usually puts lodging out of our price range, we decided to give it
a try.  Sure enough, not only was the Inn fairly expensive, but it also
was full.  However, they also owned the motel at the other end of town
(which we had taken for abandoned) and they were happy to rent us a room
there for a very reasonable rate.  The best thing was that we could use
the high-bucks facilities at the inn, including the indoor pool, hot
tub, and (very important as the temperature were still 100+) the ice
machine!  Wonderful!  We ate at the only restaurant in town (also at the
inn) which featured the slowest service know to man (and we aren^Òt all
that picky!)  Seems as though the waiter that was serving us kind of
forgot us in the middle of things, so the other waitress on duty simply
took us over.  I guess that when you^Òre the only game in town you can do
this sort of thing!  We had dessert at the local ice-cream stand, which
was doing a booming business on a hot Saturday night.  Cruise night was
on as a couple of pickups, a jeep and a few assorted autos went up and
down the 5-block main street a few times.  That^Òs as exciting as it
gets, which if just fine by us!

Jetmore, KS
Dodge City, KS
We switched to US56 into Dodge.  Dodge City didn^Òt exactly live up to
expectations.  No Marshal Dillon.  No Longbranch, No Miss Kitty.  They
did have the Kansas Teacher^Òs Hall of Fame and Wax Museum, which this
teacher was happy to see.  I don^Òt really understand why people would
want to look at wax figures of teachers, as we^Òre not really all that
exciting while we^Òre alive!  Finding nothing else for us, we got the
hell out of Dodge.  We went out on US400.

Fort Dodge, KS
Ford, KS
Mullinville, KS
Coldwater, KS
Buttermilk, KS
Plainview, OK
We headed south on US183, and then east on US64.  As we crossed over
into Oklahoma we noticed an amazing change.  The ground went up (this
made the bus slow down) and the ground went down (this made the bus
speed up!)  A little relief is such a relief (insert rim shot here).  We
headed south on OK50.

Freedom, OK
Alabaster Caverns, OK
One of the nicer cave tours around, and particularly nice as the mercury
outside stayed way above 100F.  The cave was a nice 58F!  This cave tour
is great for children, as the cave doesn^Òt have the typical limestone
deposits.  This cave was carved by and underground stream from alabaster
and is therefore quite touchable.  You don^Òt have to keep admonishing
the kids not to touch things!  The cave is home to thousands of bats in
the winter, but this time of year there are only a few around.  Just
before we got to the caverns, the outer support of my left parcel tray
broke.  The support was made of 1/8 steel welding rod and had been in
use for about five years.  I wired it up some baling wire and on we
went.

Mooreland, OK
Woodward, OK
Found a great place to stay here called the Red Rock Motel.  It was
fairly big, but didn^Òt have too many customers.  There was an Oregon
Westy parked outside a room nearby (the first VW bus we^Òd seen in quite
a while), but no owner was evident.  We broke one of our rules and ate
at a chain restaurant (Golden Corral) where I attempted to consume the
salad bar.  Lotsa fun.  Being a B5 fan, I had to see the TV movie that
was airing that evening.  In central time that was 6:00 and at 5:55 I
hustled back over to the room and *dang* the key wouldn^Òt open the
door!  I tracked down the manager and he put things right in about 10
minutes, but I missed the opening exploits of Lt. Commander Ivanova. 
While I was glued to the tube, Marie and the kids were enjoying the
spotless pool and the large trampoline set up for their use.  Yep, a
motel with a trampoline!

Fargo, OK
Gage, OK
Shattuck, OK
We headed out on OK15.  Did some looking around for cemeteries here. 
Saw a sign directing us to one and ended up driving about 10 miles of
dirt road to get there.  It was well worth it when we got there as there
were several unique headstones and even a few older photographic
stones.  Most dirt farm roads (section line roads) in this region are
very well graded and kept, just be careful not to get caught on one in a
cloudburst!  We picked up US60 and headed to^Å

Higgins, TX
Slipped into the Texas panhandle here.  Not much change in scenery,
though!

Glazier, TX
Canadian, TX
What the heck is the Canadian river doing in Texas, anyway?

Miami, TX
Pampa, TX
Kings Mill, TX
White Deer, TX
Panhandle, TX
The common thread to these towns is that most of them consist of a grain
elevator and perhaps a few attached businesses.  The railroad line was
built first, and the elevators built at convenient intervals for the
farmers.  The highway came later and paralleled the railroad.  This
means that the highway usually zigzags gently around the elevators when
it encounters them.

Amarillo, TX
Gad!  Freeways!  Almost forgot how to navigate them!

Canyon, TX
Umbarger, TX
Dawn, TX
Hereford, TX
Along this route we encountered that bit of Texas scenery that you can
often smell before you see.  I^Òm referring here to the feedlot, where
cattle get &quot;finished&quot; (fattened) before sale.  The smell of several
thousand cattle occupying only a few football fields worth of room has
to be experienced to be appreciated.  Skip-loaders dart back and forth
carrying the manure to its pile, and the cattle work hard at downing all
the grain that they can in order to produce more manure.  In Hereford we
tried to find a motel some distance away from the railroad track, but no
dice.  We ended up at a Best Western (again violating our &quot;chain rule&quot;)
that turned out to be quite soundproof.

Summerfield, TX
Black, TX
Friona, TX
Bovina, TX
We headed this way because we like the name of this town.  Sounds like a
good town to hail from.  &quot;Why yes, I^Òm a Bo-vee-nah native^Å&quot;

Farwell, TX
And a fond farewell (Farwell?) to Texas!
