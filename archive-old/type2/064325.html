About two weeks ago I noticed that some CV joint grease was splattered
on the starter of my blue/white bus. On further investigation I found
that the heads had popped off two of the CV-joint bolts! I found a
couple of spares in my bolt drawer. But while torquing the thing
down, another bolt broke, this time in the middle. I guess the remedy
is to replace them all with new ones.

BTW, my mail reader, and probably a lot of others on the net, can't
handle line wraps. So I can only gues that Blake's post relates a
story about his CV joint coming loose and knocking all over the
place.

Keep lines under 80 columns, please.
