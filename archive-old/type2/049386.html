Subject: Re: [T2] Center pin woes resolved

&gt;I've finally got my new center pin installed, this after countless hours
and
&gt;two center pin kits. 

&gt;Scot, I'm interested in what made you decide to replace the center pin
&gt;in the first place.  

I had a lot of play in the steering wheel for some time. So, I had the front
end checked out before a trip down the Oregon and California Coast. Was told
I needed (ouch) new ball joints, steering dampner, tie rod end, steering box
and center pin. Most immediate were the ball joints and tie rod end, so I
had this done. With the new ball joints, the bus handled really weird.
Actually, I think I was so use to the many years of loose steering. Just
having the ball joints done made the steering tighter, more responsive, but
definitely still loose. The trip down the coast was nice, that is when the
van was parked. A combination of coast winds and very high, very narrow
roads made the drive quite harrowing. So getting the front end sorted out
was a definite must after the trip. The new center pin took a good amount of
play out of the steering wheel. I've also replaced the dampner, still saving
for the box(leaking). Part number for center pin kit is 211-498-171A.
BTW, since replacing the pin, which involved for me removing the front beam,
the steering wheel is a little off kilter. When driving, the arms aren't at
90 degrees, about 5 degrees off. I wonder did I change this when I removed
the drag link?
