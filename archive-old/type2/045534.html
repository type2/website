Subject: [T2] parts needed

We are in the process of getting our 72 westie back on
the road after a couple of years in storage.  We are
looking for a few parts to replace while we're at
work.
We could use some leads as we have been off the list
for over a year.  The gods saw fit to send a fine
motor our way and now we're anxious to be motoring
again.  Thanks.

Kurt and Julie
72 Campmobile
Madison, Wi.
