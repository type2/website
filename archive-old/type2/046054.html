Subject: [T2] Sliding Door (76) For Sale

Sage Green, not perfect but not rusted out at the bottom either. No glass or 
other hardware. $50.00 (Last one I saw in a junkyard equal to this one, they 
wanted $145.00) Northern Virginia area only, no shipping.    Thanks, Jeff S.

PS Was from a '76, not sure what years it will fit
