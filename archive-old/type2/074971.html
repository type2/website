&gt; &gt;Has anyone here in the states purchased anything from Just Kampers in the

&gt; &gt;and was wondering how the overseas shipping went.
&gt; 
&gt; If shipping is a hundred dollars, it may be worth it, just to get a kit.

if time is not a problem consider &quot;surface&quot; shipment.   it might be as low
as 10% of air freight, but consider several weeks for shipment is about
right.   ship to Japan air is 50cents the half ounce.  surface is about $2
lb, varies by item.

&gt; I've looked into doing something like this myself, using my old front belts. 
&gt; (I replaced my front belts with retracting belts from a Beetle.) Presumably 
&gt; there's some major drilling involved; otherwise, I just don't see how it 
&gt; could mount. Even if you anchor it beneath the seats, and use a loop device 
&gt; over the shoulder (as I've seen in a few vehicles), it requires some dodgy 
&gt; jury-rigging that just doesn't seem entirely safe to me. Has anybody else 
&gt; undertaken a project like this? I'd love to put shoulder belts on all my 
&gt; seats, if I could see a way to do it.
