Subject: Re: Source for a 1971 bus owners manual?
Message-Id: &lt;v03110720b33d7acf0dbc_at_[24.92.77.230]&gt;

&gt;Is it really illegal?  Assuming Lealon owns a '71 bus, isn't the owner
&gt;entitled to posess an owners manual for their bus?  I wouldn't think VW
&gt;would care if someone photocopied a manual for this purpose.

This just keeps coming up. 8)

The key word is &quot;distribute&quot;. To pass out, to share. You can't distribute
copyrighted material. Even if you do it for free.

There are some exceptions to this in US copyright law (other jurisdictions
may vary but G7 nations have treaties that enforce these basic ground
rules):

--You can make one copy, a complete copy, for personal use only. You have
to make the copy, the owner of the original can't make it because that
constitutes distribution--he already *has* a copy.

--You can make multiple copies and distribute them for for classroom
instruction purposes only.

--Other exceptions as well, I'm not going further into it, relevant URLs on
request.

The point is that you CAN copy an owner's manual or even a Bentley, but you
can't copy YOUR owner's manual or Bentley and send it to somebody. See?
Again, as long as you don't DISTRIBUTE copies of other people's work you're
fine. And there is nothing to stop you from letting somebody borrow your
original owner's manual. Get it?

If I am wrong about this I wish somebody would provide a citation.
