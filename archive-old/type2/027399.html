Subject: 1980 EGR gasket help wanted

My 1980 2.0l engine is already for final assemble (tin, EGR, exhaust, FI). 
However in search of the EGR gaskets I have a problem. I asked my rebuilder 
to order the set for me and VW gave them 6 gaskets (4 15mm and 2 14mm). ETKA 
states that two 14mm are placed at the tin (where EGR pipe passes through) 
and one 15mm at the crossover pipe. Then it gives a part number on the text 
sheet that has a &quot;x&quot; marked for quantity. These are 15mm gaskets. But also 
another 5.5mm and 19mm gasket are called for in the diagram to complete the 
system.

My question is did VW just substitute 2 of the 15mm gaskets to replace the 
19mm and the 5.5mm???
