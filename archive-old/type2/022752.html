X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

&lt;The cross section of the shorter piece looks like a &quot;U&quot;.  The cross section of the
longer piece looks like the &quot;U&quot; with a bulb attached to one side of it.  Is
this correct?&gt;

Not sure. Try calling the place you ordered it from just to be sure.

&lt;Will this seal as well or better then the original?&gt;

If done correctly, yes.

&lt;Do I need to use contact cement or something when I install these?&gt;

maybe. when i did this, i did not use any cement on the luggage rack seal. i did use a little loctite on the rubber flap that covers the opening between the two sections of poptop. also used a little loctite on the front (front is front) sections of the poptop where the &quot;U&quot; rubber seal goes. make sure you fit everything first before using cement.  good luck.
