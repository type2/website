Subject: Re: [T2] pump up lifters

Steve and the List. A type 4 oil filter cannot &quot;lose its prime.&quot; It is 
located 100% vertical, and is always full. Let the engine sit for three hours 
or three years, and take off the filter. It will be full. Secondly, unless 
you've devised a way to fit roller type lifters, they are gonna rotate in 
their respective bores. They have to, or the wear would be incredible. You're 
supposed to install them hole up when assembling the engine, to try to ensure 
full lifters on initial start up. Once the engine has been started for the 
first time, the location of said holes is a crap shoot.
See 'y all,
Robb
