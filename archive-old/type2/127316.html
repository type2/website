&gt; I got all excited the other week when I read an article in a

&gt; with German-made handcontrols.  Calls were made, emails were sent and I

&gt; purchased the controls in a tiny machine shop somewhere in Germany in about
&gt; 1973.  I was being born at about that time.

Hand controls are very hard to get, mostly due to the liability involved
in their manufacture.

If you can borrow a set of hand controls, they can be reproduced by any
competent machine shop, for a reasonable price.  Just _don't_ tell them
what you are doing with all those odd parts they are making for you!

I have a friend who had hand controls made this way for his cars and for
his airplane.  Oddly enough, the airplane was much easier to adapt to hand
controls!
