Niall, just pop the cover and loosen the spring a couple of stops. (Loosen
toward the way  the flapper swings). It'll get better for a while, too rich and
it will run bad too and the tail pipe will be sooty. Just take it easy and you
will get it better.
The position fo the richness screw ONLY effects the richness at idle and not
when there is any significant flow. (IOW, idle, not driving richness.)

&gt; I was wondering if there is a way to determine if an AFM is adjusted
&gt; properly - ie is the big coil spring set correctly?  Is there a
&gt; specification for how much torque it should take to open the flap all the
&gt; way or some such thing?  I suspect that the spring on one that I have is too
&gt; tight.
