Subject: need alternator tin piece
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.5.32.19990421093831.00886e70_at_mail.bhm.bellsouth_dot_net&gt;

Hello All:

I am searching for the piece of tin that attaches to 
the back of the alternator on the late baywindow busses.
Not sure the exact years, assuming all the type IV engines
had them?

It is the piece that the wiring harness from the alternator
to the starter/voltage regulator goes through and is held on 
by three small nuts.

Does anyone have a spare that would be willing to part with?
Any suggestions on where to look?

thanks-
Rob
