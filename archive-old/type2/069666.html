Subject: insurance--Great Rates

Well....I have been with USAA(Military Insurance) for many years and have
always found that they offered the best rates....that is until the other
day.  I joined camping worlds Presidents Club which gives discounts on
camping stuff and also enables you to get TONS of junk mail.

Well one piece offered RV insurance and said to call for a free quote.  Well
what the heck.

I had been paying $365 for 6 months with USAA for Liability only.

Now with the Camping World MVP Insurance Plan I am PAying $299 for 6 months
but I am getting FULL COVERAGE--Collision and all!!!

I don't really want to go into details but if interested give them a
call---800-727-8200

Normal disclaimer---I don't work for them....but they have me as a customer
now!!!
