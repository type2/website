Subject: [T2] Value of 1970 Adventurevagen?  contemplating sale?

I was pondering selling my 1970 Adventurevagen and was curious what I should
be asking for it.

It is a high top camper with full standing room inside, with the drop down
rear for a luggage rack.  It is creme and in great shape.  The interior is
near-perfect.  No tears in upholstery, door panels in great shape.  It has a
1600dp with 10K on rebuild (in my beetle, not the bus, it has 1k in the
bus!)  It has a refrigerator, 2-burner stove, hand pump sink, brand new
futon (comfortable!!), 2 new batteries (deep-cycle for fridge, regular for
running), 4 new tires, new brakes (shoes, cylinders, drums), new foglights,
cd player, all lights work inside and out, new halogen headlights, all locks
work perfectly, all latches work, slider doesn't bind, generally in great
shape.

I need to know what I should set as the high price to start at, and what I
should realistically expect out of it.

Thank you..
