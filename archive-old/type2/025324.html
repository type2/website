&gt; Also, any advice or &quot;must dos&quot; for putting a motor back in would be most
&gt; appreciated.  Anyone have any &quot;workarounds&quot; for not being able to find a
&gt; clutch alignment tool.  My buddy says he's known a few people who were
&gt; able to line things up w/a screwdriver, but I'm not sure I could intuit my way
&gt; thru' it.

If you have skinny fingers like mine, you can just stick your little finger
in the pilot hole on the clutch disc, line the pilot bearing hole (in the
gland nut) up with the clutch disc, and tighten away.

3/8&quot; dowels work too.

One thing I do know is that the Rabbit clutch alignment tool does *not* work
on a Type 1 clutch.
