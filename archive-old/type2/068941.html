We used to pull a trailer with three small street bikes (100cc to 200cc) 
with a '72 Westy with the smaller (1700? cc) engine with what we 
considered no problems.  We would have one or two canoes on top and up to 
7 people in it for camping.  Don't expect to have overwhelming power but 
2500cc?  Much bigger than I'm used to.  Is that too big for towing?  
Don't know enough internals on these engines to know that one.
