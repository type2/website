Subject: Re: [T2] ??? Mystery Distributor

Hi Bob,
	Thank Gawd somebody else has seen one!  How did you get your hands on it?  
I had a friend working at Bugworld in Sacramento, and I found it while 
browsing through their pulls.  It looked brand new.  It is a vacuum and mech 
advance combo diz.  Interesting about the flat spot.  Mine drove like a bat 
outta hell.  No flat spots and a ton of pull from idle to 4th gear.  Let me 
know what you find out!  Thanks.

	Eron
PS.  If anyone out there has seen a root-beer metallic brown '70 Bug in the 
Sacramento area, stop her!  That's my distributor!


&gt;
&gt;Eron,
&gt;
&gt;It's a strange coincidence that you should post this on Monday.
&gt;Yesterday I pulled one of these distributors out of my '69 bug project
&gt;(knowing that it will be a long while before it's ready to run) to try
&gt;in my bus, a '73 panel that a PO swapped in a Type 1 engine for the Type
&gt;IV. It had a 009 that I put in last year under misguided advice.
&gt;
&gt;I wasn't sure what this dizzy was and I didn't take the time to try to
&gt;look it up.  I only knew that it was a vacuum advance when I pulled it.
&gt;I disassembled it to clean and lube and that's when I found it was a
&gt;dual advance.  I've got a SVDA on order from John Connolly, but he is
&gt;back ordered on rebuilt cores to use.  So I figured that I'd give this a
&gt;try in the mean time.
&gt;
&gt;The engine is a single port 1500 block (I have no idea if it's stock
&gt;displacement) with a 30 PIC 3 carb.  I set the dizzy up with .016 point
&gt;gap and idle / static timing at 7.5 degree advance.  My first
&gt;impressions are extremely underwelming. It seems to have even more flat
&gt;spot off idle and accelerating.  I ran out of time last night to do any
&gt;more playing with it but will see what I find hopefully after work
&gt;tonight.  I've made some assumptions (and know fully what assume means)
&gt;on the set up, and I also need to verify that my vacuum port on the carb
&gt;is operating properly. I used the one on the left side, opposite the
&gt;choke.  If anyone has any insight on this distributor, I'd sure be
&gt;interested.

&gt; &gt; Hello all,
&gt; &gt;      Once upon a time I posessed a Bosch distributor that performed 
&gt;better
&gt; &gt; than any distributor I had previously(and subsequently)ever used in my
&gt; &gt; air-cooled VW's.  Her alphanumericals were such:
&gt; &gt;      JFUR4
&gt; &gt;      9 230 081 059
&gt; &gt;      IND BRASILEIRA
&gt; &gt;      040 905 205 6
&gt; &gt;      845
