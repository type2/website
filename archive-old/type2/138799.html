Subject: Looking for seals

I am trying to find the seals or grommets that go around the fresh air pipes
that pass through the tin on an 80 Vanagon. I think both pipes are the same
size as the round pipe on the 72-79 bay window busses. Part number
021-119-627B. Used is ok if they will stop the air from getting past the tin.

Also, Isn't there supposed to be a grommet around the oil filler pipe where it
passes through the tin? The tin has a U shaped hole that the O shaped filler
tube passes through that is unlike the tin on my 75.

Any help would be greatly appreciated,
Tom
