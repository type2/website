Subject: FI harness repair

I replaced two broken connectors on my FI wiring harness. Not the most fun
job in the world when you are working with something so delicate and rare.

Bus Boys sells a tool for removing the terminals from the Bosch FI
connectors:

I suspect it makes it a lot easier to remove the terminals because they are
locked into place with a metal tab that is delicate. After I figured out how
to remove them safely, I think a better tool would have two prongs so you
could remove both wires at once.

The terminals themselves show the usual corrosion for the non-insulated
variety and I'm wondering what folks think the best way to rehab the harness
would be? I checked some of the resistances of the wires and I'm not happy
with the values. The options seem to be:

- use a solvent that won't harm the plastics

- replace the terminals (shorten wires slightly were possible for best
crimps; I'd like to keep the current color coding of connectors)

- do nothing and wonder why the FI is acting up in a few years like the
D-Jet folks
