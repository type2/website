Subject: Re: [T2] Low vacuum in rebuilt engine

Sounds like you didn't adjust the valves correctly,
did you screw the adjuster in until it just made
contact with the pushrod and from there in 1 1/2 to 2
turns, then at 300-500 miles check them again. The
dist drive shaft should have been caught before the
engine was installed, it should have been positioned
corectly by the builder. good luck with it. Phil
