All,

While I agree that they need to work on their web page, I'd have to
say that I've bought quite a bit of stuff from them and never had a
problem and would recommend them.

&gt; &gt;How is the parts place called &quot;Busboys&quot; (found 'em surfing the web)
&gt; &gt;to deal with?
&gt; 
&gt; I think the fact that they haven't updated their website since 1997
speaks
&gt; for itself.  And don't even THINK about sending them $4.
&gt; 
&gt; Check the ARCHIVES (always a *SUPER FUN* way to start) for more
opinions.
&gt; 
&gt; Have fun-
