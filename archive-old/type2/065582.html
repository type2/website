But isn't there a version using these heater boxes with the three bolt flanges that will accept 
a simpler exhaust ...maybee just a muffler with dual intakes? If so where could these parts be

The standard exhaust system for an '82 Vanagon is a complex system madeup of a
crossover pipe, catalytic converter, and muffler (not to mention the heater
boxes) and was quoted to me from Midas muffler recently at $900 ...John Jensen
