Subject: Re: The Velvet Monkeywrench

The Velvet Monkeywrench is back in print.  At least according to a note
that I saw in the 25th Idiot Book.  It is well worth reading, if only to
see a blueprint for an alternative society.  Parts I agree with, other
parts, I'm not so sure.  But it probably was considered by John to be the
most important work he produced.  Well worth its price.
