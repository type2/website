Subject: Re: [T2] 185/195 Size question

&gt;&gt;slightly high at 45.(about 46)
tested at 25 35 and 45.&lt;&lt;

interesting. my speedo seemed dead on when comparing it to a borrowed
hand-held gps unit.

until about 60 mph. then it went up very fast. i got the speedo up to about
77 but the bus was doing almost 70.

wonder if this is normal? don't know the margin of error on that gps unit...
