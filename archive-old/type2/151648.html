Subject: Re: [T2] Stroke a 1600 with stock carb and p&amp;c? 

Ray,

Biggest stroker would probably be 74 or 78.  If you stroke it, you will 
nee to buy stroker P&amp;C(different than std).

A mild aftermarket cam will provide a nice amount of torque over stock.
Engle 100 might be a nice match...

An engine delivers power based on how it breathes.  Bigger carb, then you 
need a bigger exhaust.  What goes in must be able to come out&lt;grin&gt;.

And it is not just the carb, but the intake manifold size as well.
I have always read that in the early years VW adjusted the HP by adjusting 
the intake manifold pipe size and the exhaust....look at the pics of a 25 
and 36hp engine.

I suspect, that based on past posts from you that you would be happy with 
a stock bore and stroke with a mild aftermarket cam(all balanced).
Your current carb would be ok and you would make a lot of torque down low 
but run out of power around 4500 rpm.


Look at the 1776 series that DB&amp;hvw's did several years ago...
But then, they are talking heads, cam, exhaust, pistons....then look at 
the difference in HP when thy add dual carbs.....

I built a 69mm X 87mm(thin wall) in 1972 with a &quot;3/4&quot; race cam and holley
carb with S&amp;S headers.  Stock heads.  Berg crank and all balanced. Ran mid 
15's on the drag strip.  Got 33mpg on the hiway at 70 mph.  0-60 in about 
10 seconds(I could almost keep up with a new rabbit till 60).  Used a quart 
of oil about every 2500-3,000 miles.  otherwise stock 71 bug.  No 
heat problems in Texas.  YMMV!

I had a 67 bus then and swapped the engine into it and it ran great.

Attention to detail, Attention to detail, Attention to detail, Attention 
to detail.

Lasted till it tried to swallow a valve(~40-50,00 miles) after a friend 
bought it...oh, and he had a copy of the ticket he got from the hiway 
patrol for doing 105.&lt;grin&gt;  So add Stainless Steel valves to the list 
of things you need.


Cheers, dave

&gt; I have no immediate need for an engine, but would
&gt; like to think it through very well and get advise

&gt; 
&gt; My goal is reliability first and grab any &quot;free&quot;
&gt; power, torque over horsepower, that I can without
&gt; giving up reliability.  With that in mind, I'm
&gt; thinking of the following:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  I will maintain stock induction (34 carb) in
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  I will maintain stock P&amp;C, because I'm not
&gt; 
&gt; 3.  I will buy a counterweighted crank and
&gt; balance the engine completely.  
&gt; 
&gt; 4.  Cam will be stock or very moderate, with
&gt; torque being the goal.  
&gt; 
&gt; However, I am a little interested in stroking the
&gt; engine.  I figure that I will not being doing any
&gt; roadside repairs that include cracking the case.
&gt;  
&gt; Is this a good idea?  What size crank?  I wonder
&gt; Anyone build anything like this?  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Happy bussin'
