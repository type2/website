Subject: O2 sensors...

        Mike West,
        Glad you're out of hospital!
        Sorry to tell you, the finger-tip O2 sensor uses light transmision/
absorbtion of hemoglobin to measure O2 level in your blood. So if you
want to measure your VW's exhaust O2, you or some other critter has to wear 
the sensor and breathe the exhaust... not, maybe, the best technique for
monitoring an engine.

        Check your bill too- those things may not look like they
cost more than $2 to make but wanna bet you paid $20 for it? At
Stanford University Hospital one dose of Tylenol was $7 or thererabouts.

        Bill
