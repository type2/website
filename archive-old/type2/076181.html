Subject: Re: [T2] Question for the electrical experts

Some quick answers and a question or two.
1. the bug switch does not have a built in relay, only contacts that switch from
open to closed
2. Yes it can be described in layman's terms but a few questions need to be
asked first

Questions before proceeding.
1. Am I correct in guessing that the blower only has two leads coming out of it,

    One for power and one for ground?
2. What does the package list the current draw as (in amps)?
     I need a value for this one, for instance 3 amps, 10 amps, etc.

That should be enough to get us going for now.

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; I have ordered and received my 3&quot; Bilge Blower from
&gt; U.S. Boat ($19 + $8 shipping) - looks like a nice
&gt; sturdy unit. I am going to install it in-line to
&gt; increase my heater CFMs. I intend to do as one on this
&gt; list suggested, remove my rear window defroster switch
&gt; (not working for a decade) and install a dash mounted
&gt; Bug wiper switch (off,low and high speed). So here is
&gt; a question for you electrical experts that often
&gt; contribute... does a standard Bug wiper switch have
&gt; some sort of built in relay that will make the fan go
&gt; hi or low? Another on this list has suggested that
&gt; this is a hopelessly doomed undertaking for lack of
&gt; said relay. Is this a faulty plan? If yes, can you
&gt; suggest an alternative plan (thereby saving me the $25
&gt; wasted bucks on the switch). HERE IS THE CATCH - can
&gt; this alleged alternative plan be described in laymans
&gt; terms? :-)
&gt; Thanks,
