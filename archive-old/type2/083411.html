--=====================_889472414==_

Hi there...thanks for taken the time to read my post. 
i have a 1970Westy, 1600DP w/a 34-pict3 carb. my first VW!
currently i have a Bosh009 distributor on her. BUT...i've been told that i
should actually be runnin a vacuum/centrifugal advance distributor instead. 
several people have also told me that the 009 is the best way to go. 
and now i read in the type2 library, how the vacuum advance will help with the
performance and fuel economy in the bus.?.? 
which way should i go? 
i've just recieved a Bosh 0231 170 010 from a very kynd brother that is loaded with Veedub parts. and he said that i could run the 010 on my engine. 
is this what i'm lookin for..?? it has the vacuum/centrifugal advance, w/one vacuum port. which is all my carb has for vacuum. 
just like to get some more opinions on this subject. 
also if i should change over to the 010, what would that be timed at on my engine. 
thanks in advance for any help u can pass our way, it's much appreciated. 
*shine on* -Chris in E.Oregon
