Subject: Re: [T2] Industrial Engine reefer

Hello Guys  I have worked on these before  engine is in a little compartment 
in the front  some had air cooled type 1 motors and others had a rabbit diesel 
with a fan on the front crank and a radiator. Very tight working space.   The

and have fun  Mark Dearing  salem import Service  Salem va
