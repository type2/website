Subject: 009 timing question.

I have a 72 with a 1.7L motor, twin solex's and a 009 dist.

Does anyone else's van have really dramatic changes with changing the
timing. When I got the 009, the FLAP said to set it at between 7-10D
BTDC. As the old one was 5d ATDC (well actually TDC, as it had an idle
circuit on it) I thought Id expirement and start at 6D BTDC. It felt
like there was a hand grabbing the rear bumper of my car holding it
back! 7D BTDC, runs well 8D BTDC it lunges and hesitates. Are all VWs
that particular?  No wonder says not to set the timing by ear.

On a related note, since putting the 009 in, my milage has dropped from
19 to 16 mpg city driving, is this normal?
