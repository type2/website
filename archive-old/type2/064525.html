Subject: Cold Starting Problems - summary

Earlier I posted and said my 76 is not starting right up when it is cold.
It runs fine, and it starts fine when the engine is warm.  I checked the 
cold start valve by opening it up, having someone try to start the car, 
and I saw it fire.  Ideas I have seen are:

1.  Check the battery and cables.  Personally, I doubt this, because the 
engine fires right up when the it is warm or was recently started (see 
below).

2.  The cold start valve might work when I am messing around with it, but 
is not firing when it is in place.  Thus, there might be a short that I 
am accidentally fixing when I push on it.  To test this, I could do the 
Bently procedure with a fuel pressure gauge (that I own but is 1000 miles 
away).  Or, listen to it with a tube, or feel with my finger, as the 
engine is starting: it should click as it turns on and off.  I should 
give this a try.

3.  The fuel pressure is not building up rapidly enough as I start it.  
This seems to have sparked a debate- does the fuel remain pressurized 
when you shut off the engine?  I have no idea, but it could easily be 
tested with a fuel gauge, or even by slightly squeezing a fuel line.
Sure, pressurized fuel sounds like a hazard, but what would relieve the 
pressure when you shut off?  The fuel pressure regulator is controlled 
by a vacuum line.  No vacuum = no pressure?  Or would the fuel be able to 
back-flow through the fuel pump?  Regardless, one reason to make me 
disagree is that the engine starts easily long after I shut it off, 
assuming it was warm.  At least an hour, probably more.  Would fuel stay 
pressurized that long?  OTOH, a reason to make me agree is that if I 
start the van, and then immediately shut it off, and then try to start 
again, it starts right up.  Has the engine warmed up in 3 seconds of 
operation?  I doubt it.  But fuel pressure built up.  Along similar 
lines, as I try to start the cold engine, the starter will be turning, 
and the engine will almost &quot;catch&quot; about five times before it actually 
does.  Each time, it is closer to catching.  Moreover, if I try to start 
it and it makes 3 near-catches, and I stop the starter, wait 5 seconds, 
and try again, it will take only 2 or so near-catches to start.  So I am 
leaning toward the fuel pressure theory.  But I am no expert.

Keep the ideas coming - this is great.  Many thanks!
Jess
