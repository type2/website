Hello again,

All right, got done with the suggested tests and points open and close
verified by test light, last night and this morning. The distributor
shaft is as far down as I can see is possible and the ground wire in the
distributor is solid.

--To test your coil... use a jumper wire from the points wire at the
coil to ground... and every time you pull the wire off the ground, you
will see
spark at the HT wire from the center of the dist cap. --

Using this method of coil testing I get a small spark that is bright
white every three or four disconnects from ground. That tells me my coil
is good but not being consistent. I have a meeting, but I will try Don's
idea next. Would you care to give more detail about how you did that
Don, either pmail or list.

You do have power at the coil ,, ?
	Yes

Thanks,

Max
