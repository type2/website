Subject: Re: [T2] water injection on a fuel injection engine

I have added some pix in my Tech2 album. I have
drilled a TB just for kix (I don't have an engine for
it!) see my sig for the link. - BaH

 Busahaulic reckoned, plausibly:
 
 the vacuum port on the throttle body would be the
 point of
best airflow velocity - or drill another hole in
that
same vicinity directly opposite that vacuum port so
you could insert the needle a bit into the airflow
without having to worry about the throttle valve
(butterfly) hitting it.  A slightly oversized hole
with
a silicone plug that mushrooms out on the outside
is
what I'm thinking.  After proving, the silicone
plug
could be replaced with an epoxy or polyurethane
plug
(the needle, of course sticking in through the
plug.)&gt; 
This sounds like as near as could be in a FI motor
 to the 
method I'm now using on my 1600 DP.
Let me re-emphasize: the needle point should be
 near the 
 middle of the intake pipe, &lt;SNIPPED&gt;
