Subject: Alternator/Voltage Regulator wiring ?s
Mime-Version: 1.0

Volks-
	My OE Voltage regulator isn't charging my two deep cycle batteries like it 
should, and so I found one that will. Unfortunately, I need to figure out 
the wiring myself and I'm having a hard time of it. As you all know (or can 
find out), the '74 VW voltage regulator has three prongs:
D-
D+
and DF
	I know that the DF is the &quot;Field&quot;, but what are the other two?
My new voltage regulator has FOUR prongs:
I (ignition?)
A (alternator?)
S (starter?)
F (field?)
	I guessed as to what the four letters stood for. I would also assume that 
the DF wire would hook up to the F prong, but I don't know what to do about 
the others.
I appreciate the help.
Joel
