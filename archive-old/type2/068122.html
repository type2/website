Well we just had a roll-over party for Lief yesterday.  On the way back from the bottom of 
the &quot;Top of the World Tour&quot; we rolled the odometer to zero on the Trans Canada through 
Chilliwack.  Caron, myself, and the two hitchikers we picked up in Merritt all cracked open 
some non-alcoholic beverages from the cooler and toasted Lief's rebirth.
