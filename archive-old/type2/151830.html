Folks,

Remember I was looking for late bay tail light wiring covers last week?


I received a set of &quot;used&quot; tail light wiring covers from Ken Madson at 
Busco yesterday.

***Absolutely*** perfect.
Right price.
Right delivery....ordered on Friday, received on **Monday**
**Well** packed...even after the USPS &quot;crushed&quot; the package.

If everything Ken ships are as good as these, he *is* &quot;da man&quot;.
...and you don't see me do kudo's often.  I am extremely pleased!


Cheers, dave
