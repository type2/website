&gt; I got  a notice for the test, I have recently tuned the van, would an

&gt; $450 worth of fixes to perfectly running bus, thanks!

my 78 in Maryland has to go thru that too, the time I passed easiest I
drove to Delaware and back on I-95 and pulled right into the test station
about half hour before close on a friday.  had the RPM's goosed up a
little too.
  of course tune up etc.
