Subject: Re: [T2] re: driver door on baywindow in charlotte area

&gt; by the way, he was told that a 1968-69 door would fit his bus -- which the
&gt; hinges are different and will not work that well -- he was told this by a
&gt; very careless shop owner in the charlotte area --

The hinges changed way later than 69.  My memory may be a little off but I
think it is 68 to mid 76.... up to vin # 2162132631.

From 2162132632 to the end of the 79 model year will fit a 77.
