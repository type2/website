Subject: Question on Points

Well I checked my point gap this morning for the first time (not the first time 
they've been checked, just the first time I checked them myself).  I was going by 
the destructions in St. Muir's book and couldn't figure out what the gap was they 
were talking about.  I finally figured it out from a picture in the Bentley but my 
gap was almost non-existant.  It's supposed to be 0.016&quot; but mine was less than 
0.005&quot;.  At first I thought I just didn't know how to measure the gap properly but 
after I set it to 0.016&quot; and hooked up my dwell meter it told me that I had done it 
right.  So my question is:

Is it really bad to have a point gap this small?  Lief seemed to be running alright 
although I do notice a bit more pep now.
