&lt;&lt; A better product for cleaning chrome (and lots of other surfaces) is 
called Never Dull. It comes in a dark blue round metal can and probably the best 
place to look for it is at a kitchen gadget shop. Inside the can is what looks 
like a big wad of
cotton. Its soaked in some kind of oily liquid that cuts through years of 
grime without scratching the surface. Its really the cat's meoww for polishing 
chrome.

dealers use to put a &quot;shaving mirror finish&quot; on polished metal... 8-)
