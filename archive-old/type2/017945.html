Hubby is a computer programmer, I am a domestic goddess (read
stay-at-home mom, housewife, provider of sexual favors, chaffeur, cook,
maid. . .).

We got the '71s cause they're easier to work on (for hubby) and parts
are generally cheaper.  We had an '80 Westfalia (a.k.a. &quot;The VAN FROM
HELL&quot;) that was our money pit--went through 3 engines and LOTS of money
and would've spent more if we had had a shop working on it.  It took us
awhile, but we dumped it.  Due to this bad experience, we will try to
avoid fuel injection in the future, unless we win a new car.

Believe me, in our case, two '71 vans and a '69 bug are WAY cheaper for
us now!
