Subject: Sometimes it's the little things

Had dropped a rebuilt motor in my bus last month and try and try as I may I
couldn't get it to run properly.  I'm new to busses and working in any great
depth on automobiles in general so long time bussers should get a kick out of
this...

I tried re-timing, re-gapping the points, adjusting the carburator, adjusting
the rpms.  And still my bus sputtered, stalled, and generally p****d me off
to no end.  So yesterday I take it back to the shop that sold me the rebuilt
and told them there may be something wrong with their engine.  The guy was
cool and said bring it back tomorrow and he'll check it out for me.  If it's
the engine, he won't charge me anything for his time.  If it's something
else, he will have to charge me something.  He named the price at $35 and
said &quot;see you tomorrow.&quot;

It winds up I screwed up the #4 cylinder spark plug.  The tip was smashed
inward so there was no gap at all.  Also, small vacuum leak due to intake
boots hose clamp not tightened all the way.  The guy had replaced all four of
my spark plugs, re-set my timing and rpms, re-adjusted my valves, tightened
my accelerator cable, and re-adjusted my carburator.  All within the agree to
price of $35.  Needless to say I am grateful.

Not only did I learn a valuable lesson about #1: checking the simple stuff
first (like the gap in my #4 spark plug) because I knew #4 wasn't firing
properly when I pulled the plug wire from the distributor.  And #2: being
careful about bad mouthing (even subtle) somebody's work. When I picked up my
bus the guy kidded me about accusing his engine of being bad and that's all
he said on the subject.

Now my bus runs great and I feel good.  VW community is cool.
