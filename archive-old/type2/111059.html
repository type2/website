&gt; We tried to adjust the shifter . . . no luck.  The y shaped coupler
&gt; in the rear seams to be OK.  Anyway, the situation as it stands is
&gt; the bus is stuck in either first or third and it seems like
&gt; something in the linkage is stopping it from finding the other
&gt; gears.  I am afraid it might be beyond us, however, my kid just got
&gt; Bentley in the mail and wants to give it a shot himself before
&gt; another trip to  Bob's Beetle.

I would start by disconnecting the &quot;y&quot; thingee &amp; trying to get the
transmission in 2nd or 4th manually at the nosecone of the
transmission. If you can get it to go into the other gears, then you
should be able to rule out a major problem other than sloppy bushings
or loose connections.

also of note, the &quot;y&quot; can be removed from the bus without
disconnecting anything else other than what holds it to the rod &amp;
tranny. I had one get loose. I pulled it off welded it back &amp; on my
way. :)
