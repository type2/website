STOP!  You risk bending the pulley and gotching up the case!

What you need is a crankshaft pulley puller, available from most VW
suppliers.

I didn't know this the first time I pulled a pulley, so I made a puller
with a piece of 1X1X3/16 angle iron and two 8mm bolts.  Drill two holes in
the angle iron to match the spacing of the two holes in the pulley.
Thread the pulley nut into its hole a couple of turns.  put a washer on
each of the bolts and thread them through the pulley from the front (FIF)
side, and through the holes in the angle iron.  the angle iron will push
against the pulley nut while you tighten two 8mm nuts on the two bolts to
pull the pulley off.

Before you put the pulley back into service, check that it runs true!
