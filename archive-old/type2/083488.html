&gt; Hi Michael,

&gt; I agree with the folks who say that gauges are inaccurate and are better
&gt; used to monitor trends.

If you want accurate, the guages are available.  Here's an accurate oil
pressure/temp guage that shows in both digital and analog formats.  The
manufacturer will set the analog displays to whatever limits you want.
You can even get a voice annunciator!
