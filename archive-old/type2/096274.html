&gt; so I'm wondering what stock VW heat is SUPPOSED to smell like...! '71
&gt; camper, bone stock.

hot, it smells &quot;hot&quot; what ever that is
&gt; 
&gt; I've hunted and searched, plugged holes, made sure all my tin is there,
&gt; hoses hooked up correctly, etc. etc., and still the damn heat smells fumy
&gt; to me and gives me headaches (I think...). 
&gt; 
&gt; Before losing any more brain cells, I'd like to figure out whether this is
&gt; &quot;normal&quot;. The heat pumps out tons of hot air - enough to warm everything
&gt; on a cold rainy day, but it also makes my eyes ache and my head spin.
&gt; Unless it's all coincidence... I haven't taken in a CO tester yet...

get a CO tester, buy one of the ones like the smoke detectors for a home,
when your done with it mount it in your home

&gt; Anywhere else to look? All the muffler joints and heater boxes are solid
&gt; and secure. 

hole in exhaust pipe inside the heater boxes, rare but happens
