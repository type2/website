I think you have it right.  Here's mine on a '76 fuel-injected:

hose

Ignore the bogus connection of the small vent hose to the vacuum  
fitting on the air cleaner... that was a pre-existing condition when I  
replaced those hoses... I really should snap another picture of it with  
the correct vacuum hose configuration.

In any case, the basic canister configuration on an FI engine:

	- Canister left side -&gt; fan shroud fitting
	- Canister right side fitting -&gt; air cleaner
	- Vacuum port on air cleaner connected to ported (throttle)
	  vacuum.

I realize it will be somewhat different on a carbureted engine, but you  
get the basic idea.  For example, on an FI engine, the breather hose  
and the canister hose tap in at different places on the air intake: the  
canister is after the filter, but before the air flow meter, and this  
valve is opened by throttle vacuum; the breather hose taps into the  
throttle boot, after the air flow meter, and is always open to the air  
intake.
