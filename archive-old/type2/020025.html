&gt; It was totally amazing to me how little difference the

&gt; know if this screw affects gas mileage much?  If so,
&gt; which position gives maximum gas mileage?

On the air cooled engine, maximum gas milage should not be a goal.

Fuel economy increases as you lean out the mixture until you reach a point
where the mixture is so lean that the engine begins to miss fire.

As the mixture is leaned out the temperature of combustion rises, and the
engine runs hotter.

Air cooled engines run better and last longer with a richer mixture than
their watercooled counterparts.

The trade off in an aircooled engine is to run it cooler at the expense of
fuel economy.  I think if you are getting 18 to 22 with a manual trans, you
are in the box.

I don't have automatic experience, but have heard 15 to 18 mpg claimed.
