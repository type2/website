&gt; PROBLEM - the vanagon will jerk like no tomorrow at least in the low gears

This could also be the Temp Sensor II. or at least sounds like a
possibility if it were a bay window. I'm pretty sure the vanagon 2.0l
kept that sensor, which should be on the #3 &amp; #4 cyl head (drivers
side). Get out the bentley and test this sensor. it only takes a vom
to test the resistance at cold and hot. there are more specs out there
that state what the resistance should be at certain temps. If you
don't have the bentley search the archives I KNOW people have given
the full procedure on the list before.

oh, and if the sensor is bad, it should be under $20 to replace. it's
just a screw in thing-a-ma-bob.
