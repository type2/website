Subject: 78 windshield in 74?
Message-ID: &lt;19990530155024.27409.qmail_at_aw163_dot_netaddress_dot_usa_dot_net&gt;

List,
Does anyone know for sure if a 78 windshield will fit in a 74 body?  I know
there were several little changes over the years (like the number of screws
and mounts for the dash). Was the size and shape of the windshield one of
them?

TIA,
