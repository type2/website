&gt; My question concerns the &quot;insides&quot; of the seat and seat back.
&gt; I have no idea what my options are.
&gt; What is the best product to replace the insides with?


You can go with original-style &quot;horsehair&quot; padding or foam rubber. The
horsehair padding will eventually disintegrate and fall out like your
original did. The foam rubber will eventually flatten a bit but will not
fall out. Neither is likely to occur for many years.  I personally used the
foam rubber in my '77 Westy, and was very happy with the results (still
looked/felt like new when I sold the bus 2-1/2 years later), but I'm sure
others prefer the horsehair.  All foam rubber padding is not the same; some
VW vendors sell nearly flat pieces of cut foam that is more generic in fit,
while others (such as myself) sell ones that more closely match the original
seat contour.
