Subject: Re: [T2] Bus for sale

Don,

Sorry to hear about your problem, but I'm glad to see that you were 
able to type the message in person.

Take a deep breath, and let the moment pass. Savour the invigoration of 
a near brush with mortality.

Now take stock of what you have invested, and what you've learned 
already.

Take another deep breath, and let the moment pass. Re-read some bus 
haiku.

Don't sell it yet, is all I'm saying.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Ok. I'm done now.

&gt; I made the effort, tried to make this bus worthy of my family, to no
&gt; avail. I've put way too much $$ and time into it with nothing to show.
&gt; I've taken too many days that should have been spent with my family
&gt; and dumped them into this bus.
