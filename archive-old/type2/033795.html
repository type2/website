Subject: Re: bleeding brakes

this may not fix your problem but i have always been informed that when bleeding
the wheels, you start from the furthest wheel cyl. then proceed to the closest
one from the master cylinder.  thus you would start at the 1) rear pass. 2) rear
driver side, 3)fr. pass. then finally 4) fr. drivers.

any vw techs refute / back this ??

&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; I just installed a new master cylinder,  new rear slave cylinders and new
&gt; brake hoses, cleaned and flushed both fluid reservoirs.
&gt;
&gt; Now I find myself unable to bleed the rear. We're using the 2-person method
&gt; with my wife slowly pumping the brake pedal while I open and shut the
&gt; bleeder valve. Front (first right then left) was no problem (although it was
&gt; bit long and tedious), but now we're stuck at the rear-right wheel. Pedal is
&gt; easy to pump, but neither air nor fluid comes out of the bleeder. I checked
&gt; the clearance between pushrod and MC and as far as I can tell, it's fine.
&gt;
&gt; What could I be missing??  TIA for any suggestion!
