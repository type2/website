Measure lift and duration.  Find a VW performance shop to do this.  I know the theory
and basic methods, but have not had to do this on any type of engine I've had.  I check
the cams prior to installation.  If you try it, you should find a cam degree wheel kit
with an accurate dial indicator.

If there is more overlap and duration than stock, you should have less vacuum at idle
than with a stock cam.  But, you would have to know what vacuum your engine had with a
stock cam when it was in exactly the same condition and configuration as it is now.

If you do have a non-stock cam, was it installed straight up, or with some advance or
retard dialed in?

One sure way is to take it apart.
