Subject: [T2] Pump it yourself

Hello list,
    Am I nuts or is Uncle Sam, or his little brother States trying to tell
the American people they are to stupid to pump their own gas???  Pretty soon
states like NJ and OR will have burrito attendants in resteraunts because we
the American people can't eat a burrito without government supervision and
regulation.  To all of you who aren't allowed to pump your own gas......
MOVE&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
to a state that is far less supervicious and more supportive of its
citizens....
Hit them where it hurts.  And that is the tax you pay on your bus on your
house and of course for the gas you use to fuel it, be it super or
regular....

Completely awed by Western Civilizations Demise,
Isaiah

P.S. Sorry I should have saved this for Friday.
