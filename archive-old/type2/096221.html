&gt; I am thinking of putting in my own push rod tube seals in my 1700 cc engine, how difficult or easy is this job?

really quite easy
get the Vitron seals, and make sure everything is clean clean clean
put a little oil on the seals and I use an old push rod tube to seat em,
make sure they are seated solidly,  I use a rubber mallet but in an
emergency I used a piece of 2X4 as a hammer
