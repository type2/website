&gt; Okay. When an  engine gets this hot is better to pull over and shut  
&gt; off the engine or let it idle? 

leave the engine on, but I've heard to actually run it  above 1500 RPM
as that's roughly the break-even point for how fast the fan must turn to get
enough air through the engine to cool it.

can anyone confirm this?
