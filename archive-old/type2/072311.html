I have a 79 California type 2.

Whenever I would accelerate, it would begin to miss horribly. 
It backfired frequently. 

With the help of a very tenacious mechanic (which I am not), we finally found 
the secret. Correct me if I heard this wrong, but this is what he told me. 

He is &quot;VW Howard&quot; Pitkow of Wyndmoor, PA. And he is one hard-working guy who 
will not take NO for an answer. 

Someone had replaced the fuel relay that is good for CALIFORNIA only, with a 
standard fit-any-bus relay. 

They look the same. But the California relay controls the 4th injector. Why? 
I haven't a clue. 

Looking from the outside, the wire from the injector goes directly to this 
relay, and everything looks OK, if it is connected. Remove the relay, and 
where a pin is supposed to be, we find ...... nothing ......

The way the injection works is the &quot;brain&quot; controls the ground. The hot wire 
goes directly to each injector (except #4). Amazingly, the injector was 
getting enough current by magic to blink the light, but when we got up to 
speed it was insufficient voltage to inject the fuel. 

The warning is: There is a CALIFORNIA-ONLY fuel relay. Do not attempt to use 
the normal relay. God help you if you do. I am putting CA in nail polish on 
mine right now.
