&gt;  What I want to do is go camping, not in a RV park but way out some dirt
&gt;road in the mountains where I can see some of mother natures beauty. I'm
&gt;looking for an area which doesn't impose on anyone's private property ( but
&gt;if you know of someone who wouldn't mind ) near Lake Shasta, Calif, or
&gt;southern Oregon. Katelyn (11) and I would like to take the Roadcow out and

I've little to no personal experience up that way-only been through once, 
but I found a great site just North of Orick, called Gold Bluffs Beach. 
Here's what I had to say at the time:

I've read that Fern Canyon is a must see. Didn't make it on that trip as 
finding a place to sleep was of paramount importance, and the sites at 
the beach were all snatched up. The book I mention in the post is 
California Camping by Tom Stienstra. This is the bible of golden state 
camping. By far the best $5 I ever spent (bought mine almost 10 years 
ago: it was cheaper then). Here's a link:

http://www.tomstienstra_dot_com/books-html/cal-camp.html

If Orick is too far, or you want mountains instead of beaches, go get 
this book. You will not regret it, I guarantee it. The best feature is 
what he calls the &quot;5%&quot; club. Mostly out of the way, little heard of 
places, often times cheap or free, few if any services, few if any idiots 
with boom boxes. Good, good stuff. Supposedly the new edition is even 
better than my old battle weary copy-I may need to personally research 
this.  ;-)


Peace,
