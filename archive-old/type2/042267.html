Steve,
First, you want to set the idle.  If the car is idling fast, the
centrifugal advance will be advancing the timing and messing up your
settings.  So, get yourself a bentley manual, figure out what you're
idle's supposed to be, set it to that, and then adjust the timing.

Next, you will want to check your breaker plate for movement.  The
vacuum unit not working is totally unrelated to the points and the
condensor(correct me anyone if I'm wrong).  You  should be able to hand
turn the breaker plate.  If it doesn't work, you will need to take it
apart and grease that puppy or spray some silicon spray and see if that
frees it up.  Don't use wd-40 cuz that'll just dry out after a while.

Let me know if you want info on how to rebuild the distro.

&gt; 1) in the library, bartnik notes it is important to set the idle properly
&gt; before doing engine timing. muir has those steps reversed. which is
&gt; correct, please?
&gt; 
&gt; 2) muir notes checking vacuum advance is done by sucking the tube from the
&gt; air intake distributor to the dizzy. the plate the points are on should
&gt; then move. i get no movement, nada. if no movement, muir says change points
&gt; and condensor. is there any more to it then that?
&gt; 
&gt; thank you,
