Subject: ignition switch

has anyone ever noticed that the '75 to '79 ignition
switch is much more awkward to turn than the '68 to
'74?  Or is it just me?  When I crank my 79 camper it
just seems that my arm is never at a comfortable angle
to turn the key and the 74 seems to provide for a much
more natural arm position.  Greg
