Should I continue to fiddle with the wing nut, or do I have a bigger
problem.

Sounds similar to the problem I had with my beetle. The clutch was pretty
new and i couldn't get it to disengage properly. Turned out some of the
fingers (is that the right word) in the clutch mechanism had come adrift.
The cable with the wing nut was pulling and was pushing on the thrust
washer. This was engaging with the rotating fingers of the clutch but
because some of them were broken the clutch plate wouldn't fully free itself
&gt;from the flywheel.

A new clutch under guarantee was needed.
