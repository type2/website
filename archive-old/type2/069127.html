Subject: VW weekend (21-window home!)LONG (possibly boring)

Started off at 8:00am Friday morning by doing the famous Easterwood 
&quot;yard-bus shuffle&quot;.  The guy that was going to help me decided to blow 
me off so I was on my own all day.

My first objective for the day was to take the '66 Westy roll-over bus 
to the crusher (don't FLAME me -- it landed hard when it rolled and 
anything that could be used was stripped!).

Of course that bus was behind three others (all sans engines) that had 
to be moved onto the street.  It was going to be tricky by myself with 
no &quot;pusher&quot;.  My driveway is on an incline and the street goes down 
hill as well.  So I had to push them until they started rolling and 
jumped in!  The first one, a '66 Westy, almost got away from me!  By 
the time I jumped in the cab and got control of the steering I was 
across the street and on the sidewalk.  I got it back over to the 
other side of the street to park it.  The other two, a '65 Kombi &amp; a 
'62 Crewcab went without incident.

Next I loaded the '66 Westy on the trailer which freed up space for me 
to push the '60 Westy into the '66's former space.  Doing that allowed 
me to get the '59 Double Door Panel out of the garage.  Now I finally 
have room to put my '64 21-Window Deluxe which I was going to pick up 
from the &quot;Paint-Shop from Hell&quot;(tm RVB).

So now I am off to the crusher with the '66 Westy.  Unloaded it from 
the trailer and proceeded to put it up on jackstands to remove the 
tranny.  A tough job by yourself in a yard in the Georgia heat &amp; 
humidity.  They pick it up with a loader to put it on the scale while 
I load the tranny &amp; wheels back on the trailer.  1240lb = $31.00.

Go back to the house to drop off the tranny.  I decide it is too heavy 
to carry up the drive to the garage by myself, so I just leave it on 
the sidewalk beside the drive.

Next Objective:  Pick up a friend's '64 Standard to drop off at the 
paint shop where I am going to pick up my 21-Window.  He finally shows 
up about an hour late and we go pick his bus up.  About halfway of the 
1-1/2 hour drive to the paint shop, we run into an afternoon thunder 
shower.  By the time we get there the bus was completely dry.  Unload 
the bus and go to inspect my '64 21-Window which had been painted 3 
days earlier.

I was VERY DISAPPOINTED to find 4 RUNS IN THE PAINT.  The painter 
assured me that after the paint cured for about a week he would wet 
sand and buff the runs out.  He then had the nerve to ask for the 
$600 balance due on the paint job.  I reminded him that I was to pay 
the balance when the bus was finished, and until he got the paint 
smoothed out, it is NOT finished!

Loaded it up, took it home, unloaded it, and put it in the garage.  
It was 10:30pm and I was both physically and mentally drained.

At 8:00am Saturday morning I got up and began moving the vast 
&quot;Easterwood Fortune&quot; (i.e. parts, junk, &amp; treasure) from the garage 
to the attic so I will have room in the garage to re-assemble the 
21-Window.  

At 8:30am the Police arrived to tell me someone complained about the 
five buses parked on the street.  I explained my situation and the 
police woman was very polite and even said she didn't understand why 
they had complained, since I was not blocking traffic, and there is a 
construction dumpster in front of the house next door on the same side 
of the street.

She said she wouldn't give me a ticket if I just went ahead &amp; moved 
the two &quot;drivers&quot; back into the yard.  I joked with her that they must 
have thought it would be easier to call her out there than to just 
walk down the street to ask me about the situation.

Spent the rest of the day cleaning out the garage in between rain 
storms.

Sunday I finished cleaning the garage and pushed the 21-Window out to 
snap a couple of pictures.  Called a friend over to help me put two 
trannys and an engine in the back of the garage before pushing the bus 
back in.  Then I hooked a chain on the '66 Westy to pull it up to the 
front of the driveway.  Hooked it up to my come-along and eventually 
get it back up the drive so now I only have two parked out on the street.

I will post the photos on my web page after I get them developed 
tomorrow.  Now I have to finish laying out the latest issue of the 
Old Bus Review.  After I get the graphics from Tom B. it will go to 
press at the end of the week.
