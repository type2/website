Subject: Oil Temp. Gauge is Freaky!

I've got an oil temperature sender installed into the front side of the =
deep sump thats on my bus.  This is connected to a 300 degree VDO gauge. =
 Sometimes the gauge is nice and steady, but most of the time the needle =
is wobbling all over the place or is stuck up at 300 degrees (usually at =
a stoplight and I know it's not that hot because it also does it when I =
first start the thing).  When I step on the gas the gauge falls back to =
what is the actual temperature, around 175-180 degrees  I know this =
isn't the ideal place to put the temperature gauge, but it at least =
should let me do temperature trending so that I'll know when the engine =
is running hotter than normal, so save the flames.
