What ever happened to Busses By the Arch in St. Louis?  I loved that event.
I think Bill was perhaps getting tired of organizing it, and perhaps he
stepped down. He did a great job, but lately I can't get info on this
awesome bus event. It used to be held both Memorial and Labor day weekends,
though I haven't made it since '97.  Anybody got the scoop?
