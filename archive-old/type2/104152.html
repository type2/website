Subject: Re: [T2] yet another FART...Glossy Side Up or Down?

....

I will admit I don't know. My guess is that the shiny side goes down. I 
just note a few occasions in the past when I have seen original installs 
that was the way they were. Even that is not proof positive because the 
seal could have been removed/replaced. I can't think of any reason why one 
way might be better than another. There has to be a reason. Otherwise, why 
would they add the cost of the extra treatment on one side????

&gt;Maybe. Maybe not. Just checked the new seal sitting in front of me by
&gt;throwing it in the bathtub, filling it with H2O, and even squeezing it while
&gt;holding it under same. Closed cell foam. It also floats. Nada on the water
&gt;retention. Any other thoughts?
