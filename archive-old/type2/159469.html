These &quot;Mexico new crate motors&quot; you speak of...
  Is there a way to easily distinguish these 'all new' Meximotor
longblocks from other less-than-reputable 'all-new' longblocks available
from various vendors?   Who's got the real thing?  Who's got the
BeetleMex/GEX knock-off?

Looking in the archives has been both enlightening and confusing.   I
can't quite figure out if the solid lifter Meximotors come with dished,
flat or domed pistons.   
  aircooled_dot_net tech help says all solid lifter blocks come with domed
pistons
  old volks home site says dished pistons come on the new mexican
motor
  Bus Depot - product page doesn't say

The only odd failures I've seen with mine is one broken cylinder stud.
I've heard of one other person who had this problem.  I don't know if
this
was a metallurgy or torque problem, but it was sure a shocker when I
pulled the valve cover to adjust the valve and saw that stud hanging
out!

If I had it to do again, I'd still buy a Meximotor, but I would pull
the
cylinder studs and replace them with known good German studs.  It's
easy
before you install the engine in the bus.
