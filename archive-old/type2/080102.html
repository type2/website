&gt; so if i'm standing at the back of the car, looking in to the engine
&gt; compartment... &quot;back&quot; is close to me (toward the rear of the van) front is
&gt; furthest from me (toward the front of the van)...that makes number one right
&gt; side front, number 2 right side rear, number 3 left side front (which is
&gt; confusing cause i read muir when i first started learning vans and doesn' he
&gt; harp on number 3 being next to the oil cooler? or is that in bug / uprights?)
&gt; and number four left side rear...

Number 3 is next to the oil cooler in an upright; four is next to the oil
cooler on a Type 4.
