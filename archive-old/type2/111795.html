&gt; Muir has done me well keeping my 71 bus alive for the past 20 years, but

&gt; demanding than Muir.
&gt; -Valve adjust, Muir 3k, Bentley 6k.

Well, if your valves are stable tat 3K, then check at 4K.  If still stable
then increase.  However, one reason to check your valves often is that the
valve condition is a diagnostic indicator to the condition of your heads.

&gt; -Dwell, Bentley says that follow up checks are OK if in 42-58 degree range,
&gt; Muir implies 47-53 OK.

Dwell is not that touchy.  If it's running decently don't mess with it.

&gt; -CV repack, Muir 15k, Bentley 30k.

I see no problem with going 30K if the boots are in good shape and you
don't get a hole in one.  I usually don't pop things open unless I have a
boot problem.
