Subject: CO Trip Report--post censorship via lists

For some reason the mention of a drug advertised by Bob Dole, it starts with 
a V, is not acceptable on the lists.  Not a big deal, but thought I would 
post this again as the administrative program rejected it the first time.

Folks,

This is a long trip report.  Close to 3,000 words.  Basically it 
says...thanks, I had a blast.  Colorado Bus Club folks are the best.  If you 
are not a VW person, but get this because I love you, don't feel like you 
must read it.  Probably not much interest to the non-VW person.


Day I:

After a trip delay due to welding issues.  Rick Taylor and I set off on 
Thursday morning at approximately 8:30 a.m.  I almost died on the way to 
Rick's place.  A little white car decided to stop just in front of Zorm as I 
has going downhill.  There was car coming from the other direction and the 
ditch was about as wide as a pie plate.  I managed to get Zorm to a stop 
without soiling my pants.  I refused to give up hope as I didn't want to 
give my mother the opportunity to say, &quot;I told you so.&quot;   She walks around 
saying, &quot;You'll break you legs,&quot; like that woman in the Christmas Carol 
says, &quot;You'll shoot your eye out.&quot;

The remainder of the trip to Rick's house was uneventful.  Zorm seemed to 
like being on the road again, as I've been favoring the Bay Window Westy due 
to the new engine and my desire to put as many miles as humanely possible on 
the thing before the warranty expires.

We stopped in Topeka to pick up Rick's sleeping bags and some foldin' 
money.  We found out later, the dry cleaner shrunk Rick's bags.  I started 
singing, &quot;Fat man in a little sleeping bag,&quot; immediately.  ;)  We made it to 
Abilene with no problems and stopped for gas.  Of course, being fat men, we 
thought about food.  I asked Rick what time it was and his watch said 
12:30.  Well past lunch time.  I did some scouting and determined that a 
local Chinese Buffet would be the best bet.  We drove on to the place and 
happily strolled in expecting to be greeted by the wafting aroma of our 
favorite fodder.  No such luck.  The warmers were empty.  No food to be seen 
other than the salad bar...as if we waste precious room on rabbit food.  
What could the problem be?  Had we missed lunch?  Did this place close 
insanely earlier?

After rational thought returned, we realized it was not in fact 12:30.  I'm 
not sure why we didn't think of this earlier.  Even in a Westy the drive 
from Topeka to Abilene does not span 4 hours.  Sheesh.  What a bunch of 
tourists.  Our heads so high the Colorado clouds we didn't know lunch time 
from snack time.  Oh well.  Off to Hays.

We tried to call Steve Reed from Russell, home of America's favorite V (that 
above mentioned drub) spokes person--Bob Dole.  Or was that a Brittany 
Spears commercial???  I'm confused.  Steve wasn't home, so we left a message 
and continued to look for food on our own.  Rick gassed while I did the 
scouting routine.  My sources came up short.  I'm almost sure Reed's move to 
Hays must have raised the cumulative IQ at least 12 points.  Sorry Hays 
people...I know there are those of you who are quite intelligent, I just 
couldn't find you.  Without much useful information we found a very cruddy 
Chinese place which did NOT have a buffet.

After stuffing our faces we headed back towards I-70.  Exactly 8 minutes 
later we had to stop.  Bladder issues.  Those who have traveled with me in 
the past know my fluid consumption needs to be sharply restricted.  I once 
had girlfriends take my tea away from me at restaurants on the road.  
Literally.  At Ellis, I went to the bathroom and we switched drivers.  I 
made it all the way to Colby without stopping again.  This is perhaps a 
record.  I will say Rick's bus drives like a dream.  I told him it was the 
most solid bus I have ever drive (sorry Dan).  Being modest, Rick said I 
haven't driven very many buses.

Of course, we stopped 30 minutes later at Goodland for another bathroom 
break.  Rick refused to actually stop, he made me jump out of the bus while 
he did laps in the parking lot, trying to avoid the kid with the lawnmower 
who completely stepped away from any organized mowing pattern to follow the 
bus around.

We made it all the way to Limon without stopping.  Scenery started to 
improve after Limon.  Pretty much everything from Salina to this point looks 
exactly the same. Limon to Denver was a nice change of pace.  Navigation in 
Denver was tricky.  I wouldn't say we got lost.  In fact, I'd say we were 
found.  Found Beau Jo's Pizza that is.  Holy Jumping Italians.  That is some 
good pizza.  I highly recommend a stop when ever in Colorado.  We called 
Steve from the pizza place.  He asked about the drive which I replied had 
been uneventful.  He snickered and said, &quot;wait until you get to the road to 
my house.&quot;  Unfortunately I was paying more attention to the pizza buffet 
than the phone.  I didn't hear the menacing laughter in the background.

Let's just say that the trip from Boulder to the Walter's Family cabin is a 
hard one.  At least 12 miles up.  Too many 10 MPH hair pins to name.  After 
15 minutes we are wondering if will ever end.  After 25 minutes we knew 
there was a problem.  I start to theorize that there must be a better way 
down.  I mean we are pulling the Scamp.  Holy Rollin Motor Homes...this is 
going to be fun.  Finally as we thought it would never end, Steve stepped 
out of a drive way with Tommy Knocker's in hand.  I love that dude.    The 
lights of Denver and Boulder were amazing on the drive up.

Let me stop for a moment to comment on how cool Steve Walter and his lovely 
family are!!!  His wife Karen is soooo great.  They also have a lovely 
daughter Erin.  They are wonderful hosts and great people.  In addition to 
the Korn Feed Kansas travelers, Karen's sister, brother-in-law, and child 
were visiting.  Steve had his hands full and remained a gracious host.  
Thanks man!!!!  After a couple beers Rick and I were off to bed.  Day One 
safely under our belts.  God it is good to be on the road.

Day II:

Rick decided it was time for me to wake up and thus shook the bus.  I'm not 
sure what I thought was happening, but I know know why the call the over 
head rack in the model interior the skull cracker.  Ouch!  It took me three 
days to figure this out.  They say experience is the most effective 
teacher.  I guess I am just slow.  Steve and his family know how to drink 
coffee.  Good stuff.  Real good stuff.  Hot and thick.  Enough caffeine to 
wake up a Convent the day after Easter.  We poked around Steve's place, 
looking at his treasures and view.

After some gentle nudging from Karen, Steve lead us down the Mountain...and 
I mean DOWN the mountain.  We dropped us off at the best Rib joint in 
Boulder as he headed off for some birthday family fun.  Erin turned 10 last 
Friday.  Happy Birthday Erin!!!  I didn't know they served much meat in 
Boulder, let alone a good rib joint.  I wanted to wear my &quot;Save a Cow, Eat a 
Vegetarian&quot; t-shirt, but Rick thought I might get run out of town.   We were 
going to keep track of the number of buses we say on the trip, but realized 
that Boulder may have more buses in three square blocks than the entire 
state of Kansas, excluding Rick's collection.  There were more Bays and 
Vanagons than I can remember.  We even saw a Splitty.  After lunch, a stop 
at the RV store, the book store, and the grocery store, and we meet up with 
Leo and traveled back up the mountains to Steve's house.  I decided to jump 
in with Leo as a trip of the 'hill' in a Splitty might be worth 
remembering.  I was not wrong.

Steve wasn't home yet, so we sat around sharing stories.  Leo and I hit it 
off immediately.  Little did I know we would have several more hours of 
fellowship before the day was over.  Steve showed up a few minutes later and 
we prepared for the departure.  Leaving new friends behind, Steve lead us 
down the mountain.  Going down in a bus was a challenge.  Going down in a 
bus with a Scamp was even more so.  There were a couple 30 foot limousines 
behind Leo.  They had quite a time with the hair pins.  It was kind of 
funny.  We managed to get down the side of the cliff without much trouble.  
We stopped for gas and ice.  Steve realized the shop didn't have something 
he needed, so we headed for I-70 sending Leo and Rick ahead.  I decided to 
jump in Steve's bus to mix things up a bit.  Actually I got sick of Rick 
making fun of my green Birkenstocks.

As Steve and I got the supplies together  and jumped on to I-70, we found 
Rick and Leo pulled over on the side of the road.  Fuel delivery problems.  
Probably the fuel pump.  We got the bus started again and with a little help 
from a push managed to make it up the hill a bit more.  The pump failed 
again and Leo's tow strap was employed to finish the trek.  Finding a 
suitable place to park the three buses.  Rick and Steve heading up the road 
to find a parts store and a new fuel pump.  This left Leo and I with time to 
share in world philosophy and values.

I must take a moment to say that it rare to meet a character as enjoyable as 
Leo.  Our conversation flowed and made time fly.  I can't wait to spend more 
time with this Buskatier in the future.  The boys pulled up an hour or so 
later with a lower pressure fuel pump.  Parts stores seem to be a hassle and 
I decided to drop the F from the FLAPS acronym.  After a trip in the other 
direction, the guys showed up with pizza just after dark.  It seems we would 
not find the part until the morning.  Had the first parts store told Rick 
the part was at another parts store just up the block we would have been 
back on the road in a matter of hours.  Instead were forced to wait until 
the morning.  Rick tried to send me with Steve and Leo up the road, but I 
would have none of that.  Sort of like the line, &quot;leave with the one your 
brought.&quot;  I didn't feel at all comfortable leaving Rick on the side of the 
road for some murdering rapist to find...this way the murdering rapist could 
find both of us.

On a side note, three members of the Colorado Bus Club stopped to offer 
their assistance in our breakdown.  Thanks folks.  I'm proud to be a member 
of your club.  I should also mention the clear headed decision making and 
problem solving which went into fixing this issue.  It proves that every 
time life hands you a lemon their is room for a lemon in your beer.

Day III:

The night was uneventful and dawn found Rick's cousin Steve, offering a ride 
to the parts store.  We got breakfast at Perkins and enjoyed Steve's house 
and shower.  The parts guy continually threatened my patience as I called 
checking on the part.  We finally got the store and the part.  After about 
three minutes, I left the store opting to wait outside.  I have learned to 
remove myself from triggers to avoid crisis situations.  Within  a matter of 
moments, we were back to the bus, had the part on and were back on the 
road.  Buskatier power!!!

Traffic wasn't so good.  Going up the hill slowly did a number on the engine 
temps, so we stopped in Georgetown for a bite.  Found a neat little pub 
called the Red Ram.  Had lunch, bought a couple t-shirts, and rested.  Once 
we got on the road it was non-stop to the Jensen Family property.  This 
found 18 miles of bad road and another 4 or 5 miles of what I would 
characterize as a Jeep road up the mountain.  A challenge for a lesser bus 
driver.  Rick is the man!!!

And then there was the camp site.  Holy God's Creation, bat man.  I've never 
been to a more breath takingly remote location.  I know I've been farther 
from civilization in Guatemala, but never have I felt more removed from the 
troubles of humanity.   Wow.  The Colorado Bus Club folks rule.  I wish that 
I could list all the names of the beautiful people, but I would just forget 
someone and make them feel bad.  To all of my new friends, it was great to 
meet you and I can't wait to camp with you again.  CBC is the best.

The campout included great food, great conversation, a great telescope, a 
great slide show and to top it all off a great bathroom.  Better than the 
bathroom at home.  Altitude gets to my head and sinus tract, so I retired 
earlier.  I hated to seem anti-social, but I just needed to sleep.

Day IV:

Glorious morning.  Glorious shower.  I can't remember the last time I shaved 
at a campout.  Very cool.  The morning found the group packing and saying 
our goodbyes.   There were also some killer breakfast foods.  I thought 
Buskatier were the only ones who enjoyed eating this much.  Boy was I 
wrong.  The trip down the mountain was just as much fun as the trip up.  
Rick and I found a car wash in Silverthorn to clean off the scamp and the 
bus.   As we got gas and checked oil we hooked up with Dan Jensen and Steve 
Walters.  We carabused all the way to Silverplume where Rick and I stopped 
to check out some train stuff.  I'm not much of a train person, but with 
Rick's guidance I learned a lot about this part of our country's history.  
We did meet a very cool old train guy who really gave us some details on 
what was going on in the world of trains.  It was very interesting at least 
to the novice ear.

After trains it was food.  Another stop at Beau Jo's Pizza, this time in 
Idaho Springs.  Neat little town.  I would have liked to spend a little more 
time there, but he had a Hover Craft to see.  Or so we thought.  A feat of 
great navigation found the guys house in Denver.  Alas, he was not home.  So 
we pushed on to a model Rail Road about 30 miles out of Denver.  This guy 
wasn't home either.  As we walked around looking for him, we did notice 
something peculiar in one of his barns.  No not the Swedish military 
vehicle, not the boat, not the old sedans...a bus...hidden in the corner.  
Now I was really mad he wasn't home.  I pinned another note and off we 
went.  There are benefits to having a staff writer on board, as Rick 
discovered.

At this point I was ready to drive all night.  I had a sore throat.  And 
really wanted to be home.  We pulled into Limon around 6:30 to find a 
stranded VW.  With all the help we had in our break down, I found it 
necessary to find out what was up with this guy.  He messed up a clutch and 
was waiting for his girlfriend and the tow vehicle.  He is getting ready for 
a South America bus trip.  What a stud.  All the way to South America in a 
bus.  Rock on.  I gave him the buska-page and my email.  Who knows where he 
will show up.

Be pulled out of Limon around 7:30 p.m. and didn't stop until 10 p.m. in 
Colby.  Rick drove on to Wakeene while I slept.  I took over at Wakeene and 
made it to Junction City without stopping for the bathroom.  A personal 
record.  Rick took the wheel in Junction and we made it to Topeka around 
4:30 a.m.  A full day.  Good to be home.

I'd like to thank all the of the folks who made this trip so great.  I 
generally avoid a list of names because I inevitably leave someone off by 
accident and make them feel bad.  If you made this trip what it was by 
hosting the event, providing a meal, shower, bed, or great 
conversation...Thank You.  It was an awesome trip.  I will mention Dan 
Jensen for the camp site, Steve Walters for being so darned cool, and Rick 
Taylor for allowing me to travel with him.  I had a blast.
