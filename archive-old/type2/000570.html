Subject: X-TRA batt!
Message-ID: &lt;000201bf2bb8$b81dc9c0$2f6afea9_at_USER&gt;

This is going to seem ridiculas and vague. If youve ever noticed my posts b4
though it will be very much in character...
Ive removed the fridge, actually the whole interior, of BLUE. What I noticed
is that i have a aux? batt on the driverside in the engine compartment. the
lines run straight to where the fridge was. No surprise there. My ? is now
that I have these two leads coming from the 2nd batt into the hull, what can
I do with them? Id hate to waste the X tra power. I have a ford solenoid?
 is that what its called) that I believe helps to charge this 2nd batt off
of the first. I know you are all reading this thinking Im a fool but Ive no
clue about this stuff. ANYHOO, are there any &quot; YOU NEED THIS IN YOUR
CAMPER!!&quot; items that I can run off of this batt that I cant think of? I hvnt
taken BLUE out camping yet. We just  finished sweating all summer long and
now in this AMAZING GIFT FROM OUR DEPLETING OZONE weather I have gutted him
in an attempt to make him homey, cozy and more like a cabin then a Mobile
home. (your all invited on his maiden camping trip!!) Any thoughts would
make my life complete.
also on an unrelated note(thank god) If you hvnt read STREET SLEEPER or
STILL LIFE WITH VOLKSWAGEN by Geoff Nicholson You are an ass! j/k It is thee
Volkswagen Lovers book! ( I enjoyed still life more though)
TAKE CARE ALL AND THANKS FOR READING THIS
