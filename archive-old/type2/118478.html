Subject: rusty wheels

This is probably a basic question:

My wheels on my 72 are pretty rusted over.  Not in the sense that they are in
danger of falling apart but just &quot;surfaced&quot; over with a fine rust coating(nice
way of saying: gross)  Anyhow, what would be everybody's suggestion for
cleaning these things up for painting?
