Subject: am I leaking?

------=_NextPart_001_0000_01C2088B.5A1B2540

Hi all,
My question is simple, I hope.
How do I turn the stove on in my 79?
I turned the knurled knob outside the car on the propane tank and heard t=
he hissing sound.
I then turned on one of the burners in the car and heard the hissing soun=
d for a second and then I could only hear it outside.  Then when I turned=
 the propane off from inside and outside I continued to hear and smell th=
e propane for a minute before it finally shut off.
I looked in the archives but didn't find what I was looking for.
Am I leaking, or just doing something wrong?
Also, is anyone in CA having a problem getting their tank filled because =
of the &quot;improper&quot; valve?
Thanks in advance,
Kyle
