Blake, Todd:
BTDT, on most all of my brakes at one time or another. You've just got to get
more heat than a puny propane torch will put out. If you had a professional
plumber's Turbo torch, maybe, but I just use an oxy-acetylene torch and a
Knipex pliers. Bought a whole bag full of new stars a few years back, still
have some left. And yes, the spring clips will be toast (literally). And
apparently with no ill effect. The new stars aren't THAT loose anyway.

&gt;  then used a propane torch and
&gt; a pipe wrench to remove mine. The hard part is removing the piece
&gt; that holds the stars, it is bolted, pinned and spot welded to the
&gt; backing plate. With some time and muscle it should come free.

&gt;  BTW, I'm only
&gt; &gt;heating it with a propane pencil torch.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;If anybody's got some great trick, I'd love to know.
