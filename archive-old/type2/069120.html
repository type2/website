Subject: Re: questions on 78

&gt;Got a couple of questions:
&gt;
&gt;1. Hubby just put a Bosch 009 distributor in my 78 (2L) bus. What should
&gt;the advance be set at? Right now it's set at 7.5 degrees.
&gt;
&gt;2. When running, the bus seems just fine...but when idling (doesn't matter
&gt;if it's in gear or not) she doesn't seem to idle without burps or &quot;farts&quot;.
&gt;She just doesn't idle smoothly....any suggestions/advice to help with this
&gt;problem?
&gt;
&gt;BTW....hubby decided to customize the exhaust on her. Now she has dual
&gt;exhausts!

I have set my timing at 36 degrees total advance which puts the static
timing at about 16 degrees BTDC.  I have a 1700 rebuilt engine running with
stock dual Solex carbs and an extractor single muffler exhaust.  I have put
500 miles on this engine with this set up and it's now working well.  Be
careful that you don't advance so far that you hear that dreaded &quot;ping&quot;.
It might be helpful to have a temp guage to monitor your engine temp as you
experiment with timing.

I have no idea about the intircacies of your fuel injection so I don't know
if this set up will be appropriate.  I have heard from memebers on the list
that 009 and busses do not mix.  However, I have also heard from others
that they have run busses with the 009 and dual or single carbs for years
with timing set at maximum 40 degrees advance.

My $.02
