Hi bob,

I guess my feeling was that if one uses enough glue the silver stuff will
be bonded to the metal, thus no water can get between the aluminum and the
metal as there is no airspace there, a total bond if you will.. water
vapors cannot go where there is no airspace... at least not very easily i
would think.

Just a thought...
