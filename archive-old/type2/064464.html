Subject: '75 Westy, $5885

Item 1:  '69 Westy, almost complete. 2 owners. Good paint, little
surface rust.  Great car.  $850.

Item 2:  Used trans, '71 model.  $150.

Item 3:  Clutch for said trans.  $80, with lifetime warranty.

Item 4:  Two CV boots.  $19.

Item 5:  Carb rebuild kit.  Free.

Bus runs great, needs a little TLC,  but is a good vehicle.  I can't afford $6000 for a Westy!
