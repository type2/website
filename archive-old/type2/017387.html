&gt; Silly question.... when is the choke closed...  is that when the &quot;flap&quot; in
&gt; the carb is shut??? and &quot;open&quot; the opposite????    And...  should the choke
&gt; be open or closed on starting a motor??

Barry:
Choke means just that- not getting air- so, yes, that's when the flap is
shut. Closed when starting a COLD engine. That's the function of the
electric coil/ bimetal spring round thingey on the upper side of the
carb. It's basically a thermal model of the engine: cold when the engine
is cold, warming ( and opening the choke) as the engine warms, hot when
the engine is hot (and the flap- choke butterfly- is open).
The purpose is to increase the richness (greater gas to air ratio) for
starting. Old time cars and 36hp VW's used a hand cable operated choke.
FI cars do it electronically.
Basic adjustment would be lightly closed when the motor's cold, fully
open when operating temperature is reached.
