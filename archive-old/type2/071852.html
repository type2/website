Subject: new engine
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

i just bought a 914 2.0 engine case and im planning on building a 2.3L low 
compreson engine (96 x 78 counterweighted W/7.0 compression. Thinking about 
7.5 but..... naaaa) for my 72 westy. I read about someone who built a 2.0 and 
put bosch volvo 2.1 injection. Would it be posible to use bosche volvo 2.3 
injecton? I know its good FI my dad's had 2 volvo's and never had a problem 
with it. Plus it has more modern features like an anti knock sensor. Just 
looking for options, still go to build the engine first. Honestly im not an 
FI guro, id perfor to slap a pair of webber 40's on it, but if the bosch 
system is going to get better gas milage + more power.......

know there's some fi Expert out there who know's bosche, and thanks for your 
help.
