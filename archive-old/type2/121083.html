Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust conversion

Hi Ron,
I'm glad you saw my message. I was hoping you'd have something to say
on the subject. 

&gt;  However, there is another
&gt; issue there. You presently have an oxygen sensor, and the '72-74 setup
&gt; does not allow for this (nor a cat). Your solution there is to buy a
&gt; left-side non-California '79 heat exchanger plus a modified version of
&gt; my '79 non-California exhaust system. 

My engine is a 79 block, 79 heads and 79 CAL exhaust setup but instead
of having the California fuel injection with standard O2 sensor my
bus is sporting a '77 federal fuel injection system. So I have no
provision in the ECU for the O2 sensor. I just use the oxygen sensor
to check my fuel mixture by using a digital Multimeter to read the 
sensor output. So while I like the O2 sensor I'm not needing to
keep it. 


&gt; Another option would be just to keep what you have now and replace your
&gt; left California-only heat exchanger with a new one. (We do have them,
&gt; although at $349 they're not cheap.)  I'm not sure this is a great
&gt; option, however, because the California-only crossover pipe is no longer
&gt; available, so once that rusts out you'll be back to looking for an
&gt; unobtainable part. Better to just do away with it now, and avoid buying
&gt; the pricy $350 heat exchanger in the process.

Yes I agree, because my crossover pipe, and header are rusted right
now. I think i'll have another year maybe two before the rust makes
these pieces unusable. Then I'll be back in the same situation again
looking for hard to find parts...


&gt; 
&gt; Are you even more confused now? :-)
&gt;

No you explained the aviable options very well. It looks like I need
to find a left '79 heat exchanger, either federal or california.
I'm leaning towards the '79 federal unit now in combination of
using a 72-74 muffler.  I'd like to get rid of the crossover pipes
and have a better flowing exhaust. 

Thanks for the help.
Alex
