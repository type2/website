&lt;&lt; Wait so if I drive the bus around with the windows down then I'm running a 
risk of over heating!?  How could that make a difference?   &gt;&gt;

Berg did not have a wind tunnel
Berg did not have a rolling dyno

He did have an engine dyno.....

His bus that he said had 100,000 miles on it with no repairs was BS as he 
kept taking it apart for &quot;inspection&quot;

Gene had some good ideas, and some crazy ideas
but he put them all down on paper and sold them as his &quot;bible&quot;

Question what you read there, and also most of them were done 10-20 years ago 
without any feedback from the rest of the VW public

No internet back then to hash around ideas !

Back to the original question , the bigger top airscoops cool better
and VW did not put in the owners manual to drive with your windows UP  !
