Subject: Re: [T2] How many solenoids..

Barry,

Don't be embarrassed...I've been doing this a loooooong time.
Well, maybe not as long as Karl, but pretty close.


A tip:  when the electrical spade connectors get bad enough where you 
start tightening them up, it is time to just put new ones on....and *not* 
the ones made in China!  This is an oportunity to do it right as well, 
insulated spade lug with shrink wrap on it(better than factory!).

Drove over to a friends house 3 miles down the road.  Was going to let his 
wife drive my &quot;other&quot; VW, but it wouldn't start...starter whirred, but 
wouln't connect with the engine...turns out that the electrical connector
was &quot;loose&quot;...pushed it back on a little tighter and didn't have any 
further problems....the first thing I did the next morning was to put a 
new one on.....end of problem.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Sure enough, the idle solenoid had flipped off its wire, and the idle 
&gt; solenoid had actually unscrewed itself somewhat.  I tightened the idle 
&gt; solenoid and put the wire back on.
&gt; 
 No even 1 mile later the wire had popped off the idle solenoid again.  This 
 time I used a pair of pliers to firm up the two female connectors on that 3&quot; 
 piece of wire.  All is well again.
