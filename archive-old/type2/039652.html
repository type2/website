Hi,

 I think this is wrong. Alternators are pretty efficient and so the power
consumed will be pretty close to the power produced. The 45 extra amps
at 14V (conservative) is only 630W: less than one horsepower (746W).

 VW supplied 70A alternators as an option, AFAIK they didn't alter the
wiring with this modification. Work out how much power draw you've added
to the electrics and add at least that much power output to the generator
and you'll be on the right track. Be sure you don't put too much current
through wiring not designed for it (ie uprate the battery feed and take
your extra accessory feeds from that bus, not the original fuse panel).
 Remember that fuses protect cables, not equipment. They are there to 
prevent fires. Fires are bad...

Cheers,
