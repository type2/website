Subject: firing on cylinder 3...

List,
Most of you probably don't care, but for those involved, i'm the guy that drove out to bbta from ky.(850mi roundtrip) in my t*y*t* with a bad cv joint on a whim to make a carb trade for my bus - i made it home fine, though my family kindof looked at me sideways. Ted- thanx for the tentspace. Steve- the weber works great.  Bus question - i now know of three vw engines - 2 of them 1600's in beetles, one an 1800 (my bus) that are not firing on cylinder 3 - is this a result of the presence of my 009 dist?  Also, why does vw 'retard' the timing on cylinder 3? How does this help the system run cooler? Thanx for any input, and i will be at bbta next year in my bus, hopefully with a couple friends in a 68 and a 64 we'll see.  TIA for any input on my questions...
