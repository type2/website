Subject: Antique Insurance

I want to register and insure my 74 Camper as an antique. However, J.C.
Taylor with whom I have my Opel insured does not insure vans. Does
anyone know of any other insurance companies that offer good rates for
antiques? I am paying around $70 per year for my 59 Opel including
liability, uninsured motorist, collision, and comprehensive coverage.

Thanks,
Marcus
