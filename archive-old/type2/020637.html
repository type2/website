Subject: Re: [T2] intake manifolds: bus vs. bug

Was it on the actual intake manifold or was it on the drivers side end 
casting?  I've seen both, but I believe that the intake manifolds with 
the vacuum port on the neck of the intake manifold were from autostick 
beetles.
Either will work really,,,,
I run a single port in my 71 as thats what it came with and I just 
drilled the intake manifold (had to replace it as the heat riser tube 
burnt/rusted through) and brazed in a port for the vacuum line to hook 
up to.  Don't forget the check valve!
