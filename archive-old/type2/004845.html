Good Day All!
Walked into the America's Tire Store today and asked the counter
person who seemed somewhat knowledgeable about what tire he would
install on my 72 Westy.
He suggested the max of 205/70 14 in a Michelin MMT.  (498 per )
I asked him if this was a LT or a P tire.
Apparently it is a P tire but with reinforced sidewalls for heavier
loads.

Any thoughts or ideas out there?
Anyone using this tire now?

bus is stock, will be getting KYB's in all corners and maybe swaybars
too.

Thanks!
