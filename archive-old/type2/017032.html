&lt;I tightened the clutch cable (the pedal had a few inches of play)&gt;

I'm no expert but I'll give you a few guesses...
If you really had a few inches of play in the clutch pedal and not a
quarter inch or so, you probably need to replace the cable. It sounds as
if there's just a few strands holding the ends together.

Or maybe having the van sitting against the reverse gear (&quot;no parking
brake - on a hill&quot;) could kind of set the gear. Pushing in the clutch
only disengages the engine from the transmission -- the gears that were
engaged are still engaged. Also, if it's cold, the heavy oil can make
things pretty stiff -- especially the reverse gear because it has no
syncros.
Have a friend rock the bus while you try to pop it out of reverse. BTW,
does it roll when you push in the clutch? the answer should help with
your cable question.
Good luck
