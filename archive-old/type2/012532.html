Hi. I was surfing VW clubs and came across your email. I'm selling my '78
Combi, but I don't want to give it to just anybody. I want to find someone
to &quot;carry the torch&quot; so to speak. I've had it 5 yrs &amp; I'm the 2nd owner. I
have the original owner's manual &amp; sales brochure. It's the strongest
running bus I've ever been in. Takes the 101s Canejo grade at 60-65mph. I've
dumped a ton of $$$ into it and I realize I'll never get it back. I see you
rep a VW club. Please pass my # around. Email me back and I can send you a
flyer with all the info. Thanks for the help.
