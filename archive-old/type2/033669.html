Kinda like a chicken and the egg quandary
has the social bar been lowered because of the media, or does the media just 
report it.
Just one more step down into the morass of the me society where everything 
has to be skewed to my self worth and prosperity, the rest of you and your 
feelings be damned.
Thankfully there are bastions of hope like the list in which manners are 
still considered mandatory and politeness a virtue
Fri topic: just helped a friend buy a type III squareback complete, yes 
working FI. Guess its time to buy that FI book
