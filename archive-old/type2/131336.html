Subject: RE: [T2] Coil connection mixup 

Phil, [and all who responded] thanks for this hint: &quot;I would think that 
rusty valves seats and rings are your biggest problem after inspecting the 
ignition system and replacing the bad parts.&quot;

OK, the rings and valves.  I can go with that. Should I use some of the 
Marvel Mystery Oil in the spark plug holes?? There was a fresh, new bottle 
in the VW.

I should start making a list of things that go bump in the night, or could 
be the source of my power loss!!  This is definitely a list topper.

*** compression check

I set the dwell to 50 degrees, and the timing came in at a perfect 7.5 BTDC. 
  the vacuum read 15&quot; after I changed out all the 3.5mm vacuum hose 
connections.  I thought I was good to go.  (The previous owner, who got it 
from the owner who had it in 15 years storage said he replaced the points 
and condenser.  I believe him.  He could not get it started because of a bad 
FI fuel pump.)

&quot;We&quot; replaced all the fuel lines and fuel injectors, along with the fuel 
pump and filter.   It started up pretty much in 60 seconds.  (Of course the 
oil was removed/replaced with a mixture, and the gas was replaced with 2 
gals of fresh gas).  . Fuel pressure reached 32 psi and leveled off, then 
went down and leveled off at 20 psi after engine was turned off.  We drove 
it 5 feet forward, and then that was it.

We replaced the fuel injectors, and I have had some experience with a fuel 
injector slipping out of its seat and causing a noticeable vacuum leak.  So, 
even with 14&quot; of vacuum,

*** Check for vacuum leaks. -loss of power

*** Check that I am getting an adequate timing advance with RPM  increase

*** Check vacuum readings as RPMs accelerate, make sure needle is solid.

The points and condenser are OK, but I cannot vouch for the spark plugs.  I 
did get a set of Bosch W8CO plugs in the pile of goodies, along with the 
original wires and distributor, so I expect those were replaced.

*** I will check the plugs as we do the compression check.

*** Check the spark plug spark for properly ignition going to the spark 
plugs.

*** Replace the coil with a known good one.  Or, slap it in my daily driver 
and see how that hound hunts!! [test coil resistance between 1 and 15, 1 and 
4, 15 and 4 - like I know what I'm talking about!!]

*** Check valves [there should be eight, right??  &lt;&lt; humor]

*** Make sure the condenser and points are new

***  [[[make sure the emergency brake is off!!]]]  &lt;&lt; this was my 
co-worker's comment, but it really could be something just as obscure.

Gosh, everything seems to be just a simple test, and I/we should find the 
problem in just  an hour or two, right?!?!?
