&gt; I am replacing my carb with a brand new one from Bus Depot for my Bus. 
&gt; However, my question is this: My '70 engine is a dual-port with a &quot;30/31 
&gt; Pict&quot; carb and am wondering if there will be any problems with changing to 
&gt; the 34-Pict-3 carb the Depot is selling?

The 30/31 has a different size and bolt pattern than the 34.  However, the
vast majority of the dual-port manifolds are designed for the 34.  Your
30/31 probably uses an adapter between the carb and the manifold.
