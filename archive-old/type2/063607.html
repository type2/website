Subject: mystery module '72. what the heck is it?

Hi all;
        sorry if some of you have already seen this, I am still getting
acclimated to the vanagon/type2 seperation.  anywho:
        I was putsing in my engine compartment last weekend when I ran 
across what appears to be some sort of electric vacuume switch mounted to 
the top center of my engine compartment.  It is attached to the drivers 
side bolt which secures the heater blower fan to the top center of the 
engine compartment.  It has a two pronged electrical connection on the 
side and a vaccume hookup on either end.  There is a wire in the vicinity 
of the module that looks like it would attach to it.  the other end of 
the wire runs to the test block on the passanger side of the bus with all 
the other wires.  If anyone could tell me what this little guys function 
is and how to  plumb it up I would be greatly thankful.
thanks.
Ed
