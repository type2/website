Subject: squeeky roof

A few days ago somebody posted to the list stating that he had
just replaced the seal on his poptop and now the top was making a
squeeking noise.  My poptop was making a squeeking noise too and
this is what I found.

I pulled the top off my 72 Campmobile today  to repaint it and
replace the seal.  The canvas was shot so I removed it and now
I'll be canvasless for a while.  Upon removing the poptop, I
found that the four bolts that go through the fiberglass top and
attach to the hinge brackets were loose.  My quess is that this
was causing the top to float up and down a little bit while
driving down the freeway.  This small amount of movement would
surely cause a squeeking noise wherever two surfaces were rubbing
together.  I think a lot of my squeeking noise is coming from the
two C shaped brackets that latch into each other when the top is
down.  Maybe a light smear of grease would help also.

Advice:  I would make sure that every nut, bolt, and screw
attached to the poptop is tight.  Also put a little bit of greese
on all appropriate hinge pieces.
