Subject: Re: [T2] Whistle While You Work

Heya Mike,

I've got a relatively stock '70 as well. My 1600 SP wears a doghouse shroud 
and offset oil cooler now, but is otherwise stock.  I don't think I could 
describe any similar sound coming from my engine bay.  Could be an air leak, 
or it could be your alternator/generator bearings.

Hiya All,

The Duck is a 1970 7 pasenger walk through - pretty much stock all the way
through.
When cruising around at highway speed (55 to 60) I'm hearing a whiney high
pitched whistle coming from the engine bay.  Now this noise is not annoying 
(at
least to me anyway) and I associate it with larger &quot;flat&quot; engine
configurations, like the tank I crewed on.
I guess the question I'm asking is...........is this noise normal for a 1600
equipped Bus or to be expected?  Or do I have some sort of air/vacuum leak I
need to attend to?

Mike
