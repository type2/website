Subject: Re: Backup lights...the continuing saga

I don't know if automatics are differant, but all the VWs I've worked on 
have a wire coming off the positive on the distributer through the fire 
wall to a backup light switchh on the drivers side of the trans, then a 
second wire coming off the switch back through the fire wall to the 
backup lights, to the drivers side bridging to the passenger side, with a 
ground conection to the frame. the inline fuse should be between the 
distributer and the trans, its a big black plastic buldge in the wire.

If I were you I'd check you light bulbs, check the fuse, and hook up all 
the wires, if it still won't work, jump the two wires going to the 
switch, if it works then, your switch is bad. Happy to field any more 
questions.

Sorry for spelling, I'm tired, a bad speller, and full of mashed potatoes!!!

HAPPY THANKSGIVING EVERYONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
