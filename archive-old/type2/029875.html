&gt; On a different topic - I'm having lots of fun try to to buy a set of tires

&gt; I hesitate to order via Tire Rack or others because I don't want to pay 
&gt; shipping and mounting and balancing. I'm leaning towards Michelins and have 
&gt; found several $80 tires but can't seem to get them locally. I am trying to 
&gt; get decent tires with the right load range so they'll be safe and last long 
&gt; enough.

do you have a firestone or bridgestone dealer in town?  You can order
Bridgestone RD-603 tires from them and I recall that the last pair I got
was $75 each ot the door.  The correct size is 185R14 Load range D.
