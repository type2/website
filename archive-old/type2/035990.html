Mark, et al;

Owning both the vacuum pump and the &quot;one man brake bleeder&quot; hose i can share a
bit of experience.  The vacuum pump is the only tool that I have found to
successfully bleed Vanagon clutches with.  The hose with the one-way valve
works best on brakes.  I have two different types.  One was about $15 and has
metal fittings.  The other was $3.99 and has plastic fittings.  The cheap one
works better!  The vacuum pump is also available in two flavors.  The metal
one sells for $$$ the plastic version of the same pump sells for around $20. 
I've got the plastic one and it works just fine.  However, the best use for it
that I've found is to use it as a pressure pump to refill my leaky floor jack. ;o)
