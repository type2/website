Subject: Re: [T2] Front Shift Rod Bushing Replace


Did the same thing on my 78 several weeks ago and I have the same problem
with &quot;worse&quot; shifting now.



BTW, I changed mine by disconnecting the grub screw and then could pull
everything back just enough to get the new bushing in.  Didn't touch the
shift lever housing/bolts at all.


Cheers ,dave

&quot;I'm more interested in getting it right, than being right&quot;....dave


&gt;Note: My front bushing was missing entirely and my shifting has been
&gt;worse
&gt;since doing the procedure. I
&gt;believe I may need to replace the rear bushings (2) also. Would the list
&gt;care to comment?
