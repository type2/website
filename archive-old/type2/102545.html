Subject: ADMIN Re: [T2] Open letter to Tommy and the List

Ray, are we talking about some other list?

There is no political bend on this list other than this:  Type 2 VW's are on-topic, everything else is not.

The things you imply ARE tolerated (rambling antiwar, antibush, antirightwingconspiracy diatribes) are in fact NOT tolerated as they do not relate to Type 2 VWs.

The things you imply ARE NOT tolerated (prayer, guns, other right wing topics) are in fact NOT tolerated as they do not relate to Type 2 VWs.

&quot;Rik&quot; is NOT an administrator of the type2 list, nor does he speak in any way shape or form for the administrators.

I hope this clears up any confusion.  If not, e-mail us at &quot;type2-admin_at_type2_dot_com&quot; and we will be happy to discuss it offline.

Thanks,

-David
 type2 list administrator

&gt;Moreover, they are quick to ensure that you don't
&gt;express opposition to those ideas.  Tolerance is
&gt;the key.  You must tolerate rambling antiwar,
&gt;antibush, antirightwingconspiratcy diatribes, but
&gt;mention prayer, or g*ns or any other topic
&gt;perceived to be right wing and they will tolerate
&gt;you right off the list.   Some tolerance is more
&gt;equal than others.
