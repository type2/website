ok...I replaced my coil...no spark...put in a new condenser...no spark,
put in the old coil, no spark... put in the old condenser...no spark...
I have brand new plugs... new battery.. etc...
its only making a spark just after  I stop turning the key... but while
I'm turning the key...no spark.. just one right at the end...
I'm having no luck getting my points out....could I heat the thing or
cool it down and try?  I tried a gallon of liquid wrench already... no
go

but could this be because of bad points??

my distributor is
JUR 4
(circle with a box inside of it) 0 231 137 035
(VW symbol) 113 905 205 T

does this help?
thanks to all who have been responding...I really appreciate it!
