&gt; WTF happened to your brakeline?!?!?!?
&gt; 

i tried to remove the clip where the bendy rubber and the metal piece
that brok meet so I could remove the shock.

&gt; You're not going to be able to pick that up at Checkers unless you make a
&gt; new one from straight line and your existing nuts. I do have a line cutter
&gt; and a bender, but no flare tool.

OK.  I could arrange to pick these up if you're willing to loan them out.

&gt; 
&gt; I'll be working on getting Troy's 78 back together and my 73 dropped and
&gt; re-ringed this afternoon. But I don't think you can drive that bus like
&gt; that.

I have his fan cover, so maybe I could meet up with you guys and borrow
your bending tool and cutter.  Are they expensive to buy?  I'm guessing I
can buy a bubble flare flare tool as well?

&gt; 
&gt; I have a bleeding pump too. MightyVac or some such. I love that thing... heh
&gt; 

That would be helpful.  My plan was to use my daughter to ride the break
while I pump bleed them according to bentleys.
