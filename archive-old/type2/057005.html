Subject: We're now in Idaho (FRIDAY  :-)

Great to be back!
After several weeks off and a moving trip from Washington State in a Ryder
(save the Ok City bombing jokes) with our 78 Westy towed behind, we're
beginning to settle into Idaho life...
A couple notes:
Went up the most positively *violent* pass we've ever experienced coming
out Interstate 84, just east of Pendleton, Ore. We climbed eight miles at a
six-percent grade non-stop! Saw lots of dead vehicles on the way up. We've
lived in the Rockies, at the foot of the Cascades and have toured the
country pretty extensively, but this pass was THE WORST! Truck overheated
near the top, then ran out of gas (a 24-foot Ryder with a bus towed behind
eats a LOT of fuel on such a climb) but AAA bailed us out.
Saw two Idaho buses go whizzing by, with waves I'm pleased to say, as we
putted up the vicious incline. One was an early 60's camper, as I recall,
while the other was a 71(?). Both had Idaho club stickers or something on
the side rear windows. Have to figure out who those folks are :-)

Anyway, the new engine is performing well here despite the consistent
100-degree-plus heat. We just drive 'er slow and easy. One observation,
however: she seems to lack power in the lower end of each gear. Once we hit
the middle and upper end of the powerband, all the zip you'd expect from a
new motor sings freely.
Is this a timing phenomenon? We're roughly 4,500 feet here, and the
altitude correction (as I recall) is 1 degree per 1,000 feet above 4,000.
Somebody correct me?
Other than that, Idaho's great. I work in Twin Falls, where there are scads
of great vans -- both splitties and loaf-models. Even a dealership with a
line-up of the new beetles. Sun Valley's about an hour north, Yellowstone
and Jackson Hole are give or take five hours east -- life could be worse
for two skiers and their little skier-to-be!

Settlin' in and FINALLY rid of those annoying oil leaks with new engine,
Jeff
