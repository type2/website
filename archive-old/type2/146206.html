&gt; Renault Megane Coupe. The peugeot 607 is a beautiful vessel.

   BTW, in light of $3 a gallon gas, do a quick Google as to what's
available in the USA that's both economical and fuel thrifty...
The new hybrids may be sexy but the down the road maintenance
is gonna be a wallet-buster...Diesels are both cheap and long
lasting, but only available in cars from VW and Mercedes (pretty
sure about that...)
    BTW II, I've done some reading around and it seems that the
push on hybrid engines is mostly on getting more horsepower
on the same gas mileage rather than regular performance with
better mileage... ;-(
   BTW III, some guy in California has tweaked his Prius ($3,000
worth of batteries, etc...) and gets 250 mpg...And, yes, he does
plug it in to augment the gas engine's charging, but hopefully the
utility company is more efficient...
