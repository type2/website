[...] No doubt any little trick you can do to &quot;Cool&quot; a bus motor is worth it--In Phoenix
with about almost 5 months of 100+ degree --I'll try anything to keep my buses on the
road--TWWM, uj

&gt; I agree.  I trim the foam seal so there is a 3 inch gap front and center of
&gt; my engine compartment.  Among my bus's other problems, overheating has not
&gt; been an issue.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Actually IF the gap is between the Fire wall and  the motor--Its  a good
&gt; thing! as the air
&gt; &gt; that IS coming in to the engine compartment is Not the Hot exhaust
&gt; air--Some people i know
&gt; &gt; actually create an opening there--It gives the air coming in a &quot;Turbo&quot;
&gt; effect. I know many
&gt; &gt; will tell you to Seal the engine compartment the best you can  Which IS a
&gt; good thing--But
&gt; &gt; from my experience with heat in Phoenix--
&gt; &gt; This &quot;Turbo&quot; air coming in--on the firewall side of the motor--really
&gt; works--TWWM, uj
