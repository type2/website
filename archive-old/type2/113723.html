&gt;On my 1970, the two hoses that run from fan shroud to heat exchangers each got
&gt;a nice little tear where they pass through the engine tin. Is there anything I

&gt;with the oil every 3,000 miles?

What's supposed to be happening here, is that four inch-ish long metal tubes
come up out of little boxes on the tubes of the stock muffler, pass upwards
through the rear engine tin (through rubber seals--still available).  The 
flexible
hoses are clamped to the top of the tubes, and are clamped onto the fittings
on the fan housing, at the other end.

If you've got a non-stock exhaust, you need to do a little custom work.
I found some stainless steel flexible exhaust line (at JC Witless) that
juuuuust fits over the inlet on the heat exchangers.  I bent this around
(and dented in for clearance where necessary) the collector pipes, and
cut them off just under the tin.  The stock four inch-ish long metal tubes
fit into the ends, and are clamped in place.  I had to make a couple of
cuts in both ends of the flexible exhaust line, so it would compress,
under the clamps.

&gt;You guys serve as an inspiration to guys like me who don't know much,
&gt;but are trying to take the Muir challenge (make it run forever)

Don't forget the &quot;Hoover Challenge(tm)&quot;:
