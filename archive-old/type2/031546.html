I have been getting stuff for my VW's for years and years, probably gotten
something from everyone at one point or another...

no one can be perfect with a 20-40 year old vehicle that the manufacturer
won't even support anymore.

All in ALL the Bus Depot is far above average, I usually call em first,
and I never bother with the 800 number anymore always drop the dime and
consider it part of doing business.

and a secret, I always check on the avalability, tell em to send a partial
order if something is not in stock, and if I need the part I pay for next
day, 2nd day or 3rd day delivery
