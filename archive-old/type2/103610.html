&gt; Be aware, however, that you can be cited for displaying this emblem if you
&gt; drive faster than 25MPH.  It's really made for tractors, bicycles, Amish
&gt; buggys, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; OTOH, if you make one in a color other than orange (fluorescent green
&gt; leaps to mind) it is no longer a &quot;slow moving vehicle emblem&quot; and not
&gt; subject to the regulation.

except red is for stopped/broken vehicle  I have a couple in my emergency
breakdown kit, (so far unused)   I have seen white used for warning
