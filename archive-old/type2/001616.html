How'd you do that? Is this a stock engine with mod's? What kind of $$ are we
talking about?

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;It should; the big question is, can your Bus make it to 88MPH before it
runs
&gt; &gt;into the side of Twin Pines Mall?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I think the guys with the rocket launcher proved that VW busses can NOT
&gt; make 88 mph in a parking lot that size --- and that VW Busses are
strangely
&gt; magnetically attracted to Photo-Bug shops...
&gt;
&gt; Wonder if they used a VW bus because it was automatically slower than the
&gt; star car or because it was cheap?
&gt;
&gt; However - since it was 1985 or so when that was filmed, and that was a
late
&gt; sunroof bay - that dang thing wasn't very old when they wrecked it....
What
&gt; a  waste!
