HMO number two :-)

I have the gas adjusts on my 73' Westy and wouldn't
run anything else.  I haul alot of stuff (up to ten
17&quot; PC monitors and several CPUs at a time) and they
are great for me.  Even without a load the ride seems
fine.  I do come from a sports car/road race kinda
back ground and driving things that require a kidney
belt isn't uncommon for me (laughing), its all
subjective ;-)

Technically I have never had a gas-adjust go bad or
fail on any car I have used them on.  Great value for
the money.

Cheers,

&gt; IMHO, Gas A Justs are 'way too stiff for normal

&gt; KYB GR2s for three different cars so far, and I'm
&gt; satisfied.  Slightly
&gt; stiffer than stock, w/ Japanese quality, and a
&gt; modern low pressure gas
&gt; design.
&gt; 
&gt; Beetle GR2s are less than $20, Bus slightly higher.

&gt; .&gt;Yes, me again.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I installed REAR KYB gas adjust on the FRONT. 
&gt; Guilty.  I should have
&gt; &gt;checked the stock numbers.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;This set up is tearing up the '78 Westy.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I will pull the front shocks off a '72, as an
&gt; emergency R&amp;R.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Are these KYB gas adjust shocks any good??  I am
&gt; super afraid to dump
&gt; &gt;another $60 into real front shocks if what I am
&gt; hearing and feeling is what
&gt; &gt;I can expect with more KYB.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Oh, well, time to move cars and jack up cars and
&gt; R&amp;R and R&amp;R and . ..
