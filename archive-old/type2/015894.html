&gt;That's very interesting.  My only problem with 40wt is that I've never seen
&gt;it in a synthetic (and I'm sold on synthetics).  I wonder if synthetic
&gt;20/50 craps out at 80 degrees also?  I sure hope not.  Anyone know?
&gt;Regardless, if I could find Mobil-1 40wt I would certainly give it a try in
&gt;the summer months.

This is something that's always intrigued me, frankly. Has anyone ever 
tried using an aviation engine oil in a VW? They're available in 40 and 
50 weights, and even some synthetic formulations. I would just think 
that VW engines are a LOT closer to small GA aircraft engines then they
are to a typical wasserbox car (in terms of temperatures, clearances, 
etc...)

Downside, of course, is price. Aviation oils are ( I think, I don't do 
the buying, I just do the oil changes ) about twice what car oils cost. 
Like most things aviation related -- fewer units, more price per unit.

I can tell you this much, though. A good friend of mine runs Aeroshell 
100 (50w) in his motorcycle and swears by it. He claims that it reduced 
wear by about 25% on his last overhaul ( he puts a LOT of miles on his 
bike.)

&quot;Fraser, there's a guy on my corner who asks me every morning if I've
seen God; do you really think he expects me to point Him out?&quot;
&quot;Well you know, Ray, if you did, perhaps he'd stop asking.&quot;
