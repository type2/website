Subject: Re: [T2] 1981 Westfalia for sale in Austin TX

It looks great.

Id try to talk her out of selling it.  Take it from me,
they are a great car to have kids in!

The seat belt mounts are probably there even if the
belts are gone.  Im sure you could find em and install
em.

But I understand if it you cant keep it!
