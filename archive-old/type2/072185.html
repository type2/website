Subject: Re: [T2] 1975 Westfalia color info needed.
Cc: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Whatever color you have behind the doorpanels, or under the floormats, or
any other hidden spot is most likely the original color.

The westy's had more like five colors: orange, 2 colors of yellow, green
and white.  The two most common colors around here are the green and the
orange.  Yellow and green both had green door panels, but the yellow had
seat covers that had some yellow stripes.


&gt;To confuse matters the matrix has L62H listed as bali yellow B1B1 which
&gt;differs from the archive info. Not to mention the bus has green doorpanels
&gt;and the typical green vinyl seats with the blue green plaid not red.

&gt;Thanks
