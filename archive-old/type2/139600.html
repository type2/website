Subject: Re: [T2] Re: hoover

I didn't get in on this one when you were working on it before, but have 
had experience with this.

I had one of those &quot;aftermarket&quot; paper filter air cleaners and what I did 
was make two &quot;snorkels&quot; that both went to preheat.  The tin I used fit 
tightly between the filter and the &quot;caps&quot; that held it together.

I adjusted it so that almost all of the air in the winter time came only 
thru the preheat tubes....sure helped a lot!

It might have been gasping for air a little bit, but the heated air sure 
made a difference!

Cheers, dave
