Subject: Stupid Me, dropped my spark plug, Summary

Hello Friends,

What a list!

In less than 1 hour, I have had excellent responses from several different
people.  Here is a summary:

1.  Use a magnet.  This should work, since some parts of the spark plug is
composed of magnetic material and most of the engine is aluminum.  The
cooling tin is magnetic, but is far form the plug right now.

2.  remove the front of the cooling ductwork (the back of the bus), fan
housing, and alternator, then just reach in and get it.

3.  Use a long curved hemostat.

4.  needle nose pliers, light and mirror

5.  position correctly and reach in with two fingers (I will need to get one
of my kids to do this, my fingers are too big.

These are great ideas, thanks.

This I will fix tomorrow, initial approach shall be using the magnet.  I
plugged the hole with my compression tester for now to keep the mice out.

What a wonderful resource!
