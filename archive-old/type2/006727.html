Subject: regulator question

while installing my new OE Mexico muffler saturday I arched the end of the
VDO dipstick temp sending unit on the side of the generator.  Shortly after
I noticed the gen light on.  
questions:
Did I fry the regulator ?  Should I just call bus depot and get a new one?  
Did I fry the generator ? Should I go out to the parts pile and find the spare?
Are there any tests to be run to check the regulator function?  Or is it a
waste of time with the known history?
thanks, please respond to the list so I can check for answers during the day.
BTW, gotta love that fweeeem!
