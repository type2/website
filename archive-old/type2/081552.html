Subject: Re: [T2] engine removal/supporting tranny

If you find that you have to support the tranny on your Type 4 Bus, you have
a serious problem somewhere.  On the Type 4, the tranny is hung from the
chassis at the rear by two big bolts.  No tranny support is needed, and the
transmission does not move when you remove the engine.

However, for a Type 1 Bus, you do indeed have to support the tranny since
there is no rear tranny mounting, and if you fail to support the tranny, it
will just fall down and hit the ground (or you won't be able to get the
engine out, right Melissa? :-)

Do you have to support the tranny?  I have no idea, but I bet that if you
don't, it makes for some interesting angles when you go to put the
engine back in (you'd prolly have to jack the front of the tranny up.)
