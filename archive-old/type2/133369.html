&gt; Yes, Tim, that is correct, kinda.

&gt; The broken spring *may* have been the cause of his heads melting down.
&gt; However, an interesting note is that if the spring was broken, that
&gt; could leave the weight to the outside and the distributor in an advanced
&gt; state at any RPM (including IDLE).  When the engine was timed at idle,
&gt; he would have been timing the engine when the distributor was in that
&gt; advanced state, which would ultimately give him LESS total advance.
&gt; That's why I said *may* have been the cause.
&gt;
&gt; Regardless, that is why everyone always says you NEED to test for max
&gt; advance for your given engine type.  If your max advance and idle timing
&gt; aren't matching up to the prescribed numbers, it's time to start
&gt; checking things out.

one of the real good reasons for a good old fashioned timing light.  you
can actually watch your advance as you accelerate your engine and make
sure you get the correct rate and amount of advance.
