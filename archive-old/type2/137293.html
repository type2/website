&gt;&gt;&gt;Can one take a clock out of a type 3 (squareback or fastback) and install
&gt;&gt;&gt;that in their bus?  Are the spaces the same?  Then, how does one get to
&gt;&gt;&gt;the back of the dash to remove the clock from the type 3?  Then, how to
&gt;&gt;&gt;install in bus?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The type 3 clock is held to the dash with a couple of springy fingers. 
&gt;Reach up behind the dash, squeeze them towards the clock body, shove
&gt;forward through the dash hole.

Those springy finger things are located at 3:00 and 9:00.
Squeeze them and push the clock towards the steering
wheel and out of the dash.

&gt;The T3 clocks are usually broken, though .. I've only seen two that work
&gt;that haven't been repaired.  Ratwell posted a link to pelicanparts that covers
&gt;the fix, the 914 &quot;type 1&quot; clock is the same mechanism.

I've got a junkyard salvage working T3 clock, made in Feb 1970.
The clock body/can measures ~ 85mm.  The bezel's OD ~ 90mm.

I wonder if anyone has tried fitting a T3 clock in their
bay window bus too.
