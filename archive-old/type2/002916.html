Subject: Restoring middle side vent wings

Volks,
Restoring my 73, and really trying to make it original.

The bus had the middle and rear vent wing windows, which are pretty rusty on
the pivots for the vents.  I have gone junkyarding, and seems this is par
for the course.

Is there anyone out there that rebuilds these things, or is there a way to
fix it myself?

I figure someone out there has gone done this road before, short of
switching to a different style of window.

TIA
Adam Puzerewski
