Listees:

It's Friday and I need some feedback on the following.  I've posted this
&gt;from work but you should post your response to the list, provided the
admistrator doen't mind.  

There was quite an exchange on the type2 list a while back where people were
discussing how fast do you drive in your type II.  One of the things that
concerned people was the idiots going by far faster than the 1600cc vans
could go and how to safely drive in those conditions.  I'd like your
thoughts about the following:

As some of you may know I am a ham radio operator and as such have a license
to put experimental transmitters on the air (up 1500 watts!!).  Mostly we
talk on the short wave frequencies to people around the world, but the hams
also have frequencies that range from 1.8 mhz (just above the broadcast
band) to 24 ghz (microwave).  I am in the very early design stages in
developing a rearward looking radar that could warn a slow moving driver of
fast approaching cars from behind.  Said unit would beep when it detected
cars approaching at a high speed differential.

I have noticed that many of the speeders whizzing past me have radar
detectors on their visor.  If I could trip those radar detectors, I could
slow the idiots down until they got by me, thus reducing the risk of
accidents.  I also know that a radar detector is pretty wideband, and picks
up other stuff like door openers and burglar alarms.  So by locating my
rearward-looking radar on a microwave amateur radio band that is near the
police radar frequency, I should be able to trip the idiots radar detectors,
thus slowing them down.

The current problem that's bugging me is that some police radar units have
the ability to detect intentional jamming.  My unit is highly likely to
cause the police radar to lock up or give false readings.  That's because
the receiver in a police radar unit is also wide band and will pick me up at
the same time the police radar gun is registering my speed.  What I am
working on is a design for a circuit to shut off my radar in the presence of
a police unit so as to avoid a ticket for interfering with police
surveillance.  Unfortunately there are some states that prohibit the
interception of police radar altogether, thus the circuit would be illegal.

I am a bit apprehensive about the police reaction to all this, so I am
considering taking a proactive approach to securing legal proof that the
proposed transmitter is operating within the law.  At this point my approach
is to assemble proof that I am legally operating an amateur radio
transmitter on an frequency federally assigned to amateur radio, and that I
have in good faith, where technically possible, attempted to prevent
interference to police surveillance.  It might work in court, but I wonder
what the patrolman on the street might think.

Any thoughts?
