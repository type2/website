Subject: Re: [T2] Window support clip broken

  .....you've got to replace the entire regulator ( winder ) mechanism, the
  &quot;clip&quot;, as you put it, is welded onto the rest of the winder mechanism....

I think he is referring to the 'lift channel' which is press-fit to the base
of the glass.  It comprises of two pieces, which are welded together as
described.  Both left and right units are the same.
