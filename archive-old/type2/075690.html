Subject: Re: [T2] Heating possiblities

Matty, Biggest deep-cycle batt. you can put under your rear seat: 210 amp 
hours. Heater will deplete this in 1.4 hrs.(210 amp hrs. is &quot;rated&quot;, it ain't 
what you're gonna get out of it in the real world) Time to recharge off of a 
55amp. alt with 3 batts _at_ 2300rpm constant speed, 10.73 hours, no load other 
than to charge all three batts. _at_ ambient temp of 49 deg. f. Moral of the 
story: You can't violate the Laws of Physics. Why doesn't anybody get this? 
Electric heat for a bus is just not doable. If it were, the factory would 
have already done so.
