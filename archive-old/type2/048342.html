&gt; &gt;         Can anyone confirm whether the auto-choke elements on the

&gt; &gt;  It's for a 34PDSIT.

Correct, left and right are different.
Left is part # 021 129 191E
Right is part # 021 129 192E
I don't know how you would tell the difference side-by-side if you had a
bunch of them...
I believe, for USA 72-74 buses, they are all interchangable.
For 30 + 34 Pict carbs, the heater elements are part # 113 129 191G + P.
These won't fit on 32/34's and 34 PDSIT's.
