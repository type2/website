Subject: sounds of doomed tranny?

     i'm in the process of selling my '82 vanagon. a potential buyer had his
mechanic look it over and the mechanic advised him the tranny is going out
or will be very soon. this took my by surprise since i was unaware of any
problem with it. easy shifting, smooth and decisive gear changes, etc.
however, in 1st or 2nd (but not in 3rd or 4th that i can hear) there is a
very slight &quot;moaning&quot; sound which i always assumed indicated some wear in
the gears. the van spends most its time in lower gears, in the city and it's
the original transaxle with 134,000 on it. i'm getting a diagnostic text
from triple-a but wondered if anybody had some thoughts based on this
description. thanks. art mcginn
