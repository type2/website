Subject: Caravan headed to &quot;Busses of the Corn&quot;

Hello all,

There have been some postings of the a caravan heading from somewhere South
of PA, and heading towards Busses of the Corn this year.  I'm thinking
about participating in the caravan and heading up to Busses...., and was
wondering if the route of the caravan involved I 79 North thru PA?   If so,
I'd like to work out the particulars of when and where we could meet, so me
and the family could join up.  I know there is a rest stop north of where
RT 422 intersects I 79, possibly there?  Does the caravan need a free place
to camp out Friday night, and continue on Sat. morning?  I am approx 40
miles north of Pittsburgh, so that's something to consider.

Let me know.... I'm trying work out some plans for that weekend.

Mark
