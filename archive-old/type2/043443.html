Subject: Re: External Oil Cooler

&gt; Justin, 230 deg. F is too hot for that light weight oil you're using.... it is
&gt; made for lawn mowers and small engines, I don't care what the manufacturers
&gt; say,,, Not for a 50+ hp Bus engine. 40 wt is ok, but you need the protection
&gt; of a synthetic for high temps, especially over 200 f. Castrol Syntec seems to
&gt; be a good choice, a local shop here(S.C.), Imports Plus uses it in all their
&gt; air-cooled rebuilds. I can't say from personal exp., as my Bus is still in
&gt; pieces, but I am going to run syntec when I'm finished.

Also, an external oil cooler is a must for high outside temps, as any reduction
in oil temp is a plus for longevity. Guages are good if you test them against a
known good
standard, such as My A/
c guage....+or- 3 deg F.

My .02 1/2.

Chris.
