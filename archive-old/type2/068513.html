&gt; This vehicle is a '75 bus  with an Automatic trans.

So I wrote:

Yea verily Pete, there is a switch. My automatic  '78 bus also did this 
when I got it. On the base of the automatic trans shift control there is
a switch that does two things:
1- When in Park and Neutral, it closes the ignition switch circuit
so the key will work. In other gears, you can't start the car.
2- When in reverse, it closes the backup lights circuit and backup lights
go on. Bingo...

The contacts are brass and the housing is plastic. The whole thing is under
that black plastic box with the shift numbers on it, where the shift lever
goes. A couple of screws out, and you can lift it off and see everything.

The brass was worn out on mine. I bent the contact up a bit and it worked 
for a little while, but then I had to replace the whole thing. I got one
from VW parts dept. for not a whole lot of money ($7? $12? I can't remember...)

The Bentley manual shows you how to dismantle the shift lever, which you
must do to replace the little bugger. Unfortunately, some parts on mine
were frozen together such that I couldn't budge 'em by any means I 
could devise. I towed the bus to VW and had them do it. These days, they 
charge you some pre-determined price per job and this job was supposed to cost
($110? I can't quite remember...). Later I heard the mechanic had a 
HELLUVA time doing it and it took him 4+ hours and if I'd been paying by
the hour I would have gone to the poorhouse. 

ANyway, now my lights work great. I recommend you buy the part and try to
do it yourself, but if you can't let VW deal with it 'cause
life's too short to waste it on stubborn stuck parts, ya know?

Good luck,
Surfer Bob
