&gt;&gt; To reassemble, I had to feed the screw in through the

&gt;The trick is that you feed the screws into the clips while the
&gt;instrument cluster is out.  Then when you push the cluster in place,
&gt;the clips snap into place and you can tighten up the screws.

Unfortunately, the green Bentley book makes no mention of this.
During dissassembly, the Haynes book mentions swivelling the
clips out of the way, rather than letting them fall.

I'll try it your way next time I have the instruments out.
Thanks,
