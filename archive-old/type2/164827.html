Subject: RE: [T2] 9 Pin Flasher Relay Questioin

Ray,

I am in the process of tracing down why this happens as well with my '68. I
have the remanufactured 9-pin relay and the wiring isn't the exactly the
same as the original and the instructions are for a '68 beetle. I'll forward
on a corrected wiring diagram to you if you need to replace the relay.

As for your specific issue, if the light is just lighting up and not
flashing, check the front turn signal bulb holders. One of mine popped loose
and was causing the exact problem which would also explain the popped fuse
if the hot wire touched the body. A little hockey tape fixed mine in place.

Also, the whole wiring system ('68/early'69) is a direct-to-body ground,
meaning there are no ground wires. Check that your housings are not corroded
at the hold-down screws as these are your grounds. If you have corrosion,
you can rivet/sheet metal screw a wire to the housing and run it to a clean
post you add in a similar way to the body.

Hope this helps,

Subject: [T2] 9 Pin Flasher Relay Questioin

Hi All,

Asked a question before on the 68 bus relay,? but a new symptom has come
up.? The turn signal/flasher bulbs will all turn on, but they now stay on
steadily- they will not flash.? They all had been working fine when suddenly
#1 fuse feeding ignition power blew twice.? I ohmed out the light circuit
for shorts and also checked current draw as it is now, which never goes
above 4A.? Is the flasher relay likely bad, and if so, what is my best plan
to replace it?

Thanks!

Ray
