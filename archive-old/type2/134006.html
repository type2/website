Subject: retread, better weather, half moon listees step up

i had an oil leak on my 69 and i knew it was the stud that holds down the
oil pick up over the strainer. thinking i forgot a washer on the inside i
removed that stud, engine in bus, to find the stud jee-ust loose. needs to
be re-threaded. how and why that threading became a problem is uncertain,
but i miraculously put it back together because i have to take it to
california tomorrow. its just a slight little drip as of yesterday. also,
installed a later kid cot in the front cab. my spare three-sided bars were
indeed to 73, so i borrowed bars from my 75 because the extra inch means a
lot more roominess in that space. one thing left is to install some snaps
for a tent and its time to go to a wedding. i'll be overnighting in half
moon bay all myself on thursday night. i'm due to meet up with a crew for a
salmon fishing trip. we're catching the wedding feast. any listees have a
flatspot i can sack out in. the boat leaves at a crazy hour and i hope to
be right there on time.  - steve
