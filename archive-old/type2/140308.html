Subject: Re: [T2] Exploded air flow meter and my new parts bus

Eddie said:

 I checked with my bently and see what you mean. but....
I have had 3 fuel injected buses and still have the fuel injection from
all of them. The clamps from all three
buses are exactly the same, on both ends of the &quot;S&quot; hose. These were on
 two '75's and a '76. They are also
very similar (if not the same) as the clamps used on the fuel filler
neck. I assume they are factory parts.

 Did VW get smart and later discontinue the clamps to protect the AFM?

No, no, no.     You are mis-understanding what I said. The big S hose has ALWAYS had a clamp on each end. The
hoses that GO to the big S hose and the decel valve never had clamps on them.

Here is exactly what I wrote:
&quot;I bet there is a hose clamp on every hose going to and from the big S hose.....&quot;

GOING TO and FROM the big S hose. NOT the big S hose itself.

I tried to write it in as plain English as I could, I guess it still got misconstrued.
