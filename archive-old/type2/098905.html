Subject: RE: [T2] Oil viscosity versus oil temperature

You live in one of those special areas of the world where you can use of a
single weight year round. From what I understand SAE 30 is correct. The only
exception might be if your engine is worn and you have trouble with oil
pressure at low RPMs. Then using a thicker oil may help buy a little time
before the inevitable rebuild. 



Aloha all,

I have asked my mechanic fiend and he suggest 30 weight year round for 
here, Maui.  We have a constant 75 to 85.

Is SAE 30 too light?
