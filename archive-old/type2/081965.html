Subject: Baywindow trucks

I asked last week for any websites with info on bay window trucks.  Several
people had asked when I found anything to let them know. So....  This is all
the info I have received so far..  If you have any technical info you could
pass on to Neale he would be very grateful..

Peace Brothers and Sisters,

&gt; Hi Snoopy,
&gt;
&gt; Funny you should mention that, I was thinking the very same thing a couple
of
&gt; months ago, and started a Baytrucks page (http://go.to/baytrucks), but
there's
&gt; pretty much nothing there, as yet, as I just can't find much info.
&gt;
&gt; Any leads you may have on technical documentation/information/diagrams etc
&gt; would be greatly appreciated, as I'd love to make the page into a resource
that
&gt; we can actually use.
&gt;
&gt; All the best,
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt;
