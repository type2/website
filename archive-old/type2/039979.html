Subject: Bus Legalities

I know this question was asked a long time ago but I can't remember what the 
final answer was. I wondering about the legalities of driving with 
passengers in the back of my Riveria. There are no seat belts in the back on 
the bench seats by the table, but I didn't really think this mattered 
because I thought the camper was considered an RV. Also if it is classified 
as an RV does that mean that passengers in the back (as far away from the 
driver as possible)are allowed to drink beer while on the road? I live in 
Canada so things might be different up here in the great white north but I 
just thought I would check things out before I depart for the weekend.

cheers...
