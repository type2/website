Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Depot baywindow sliding windows?

Ron,

&gt; I'm not familiar with a 221-845-231B and it does not come up on any of my
&gt; files.

TYPO, meant to say &quot;321B&quot;

&gt; we ship an aftermarket seal from Just Kampers in
&gt; England, and that is probably what you received if you ordered 221 845
321A.

Yes, you might want to check your site though, because if you look up the
&quot;321B&quot; it pops up a weird seal, which could lead to confusion perhaps.

&gt; It fits either single-piece
&gt; or sliding windows (but not windows with vent wings or louvers). We've been
&gt; selling this seal for years; the fit and quality are superior to most of
the
&gt; Brazilian and other aftermarket seals that I've tried.

It looks good on my bus.
