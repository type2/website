I have a Holley 5200 carburetor on my '72 camper. I want to take it off and
clean it, but have been told that a rebuild kit is no longer available for
this model carb, leaving me without a bowl cover gasket and possibly without
the intake manifold gasket. I have also been told that the bowl cover gasket
in the Weber progressive rebuild kit won't work on the Holley, and I am not
sure about the manifold gasket (whether a Weber manifold gasket will work
with a Holley). I was wondering if anyone knows of a sealant or something
that would work instead of the bowl cover gasket. I am looking at a blow-up
of the 5200, and I'd hate to try to make one.

Thanks
