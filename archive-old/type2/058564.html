Subject: Heat? What Heat? ('78  in dire help)
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Ok Here's the problem... I just recently bought my first bus ('78 standard)
It's a beauty.. but the problem is that there is no heater... and I am forced
to rebuild one myself... ( I know nothing about cars) I got a lot of books but
nothing seems to help enough... I have a heat exchanger but I'm missing a
blower and the hoses etc. It used to have a gas heater (the previous owner
tells me) but since the bus was origionally from CA... it was taken out a long
time ago... Winter's now around the corner and I need to get my bus
heated...fast.... if anyone can help me, or give me any information where I
can get help, it would be really great...... thanks alot for your time to read
this......(I sure as hell needed to).....

Your freezing volks-head,
-Aaron
