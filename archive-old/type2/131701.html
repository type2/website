Subject: Re: [T2] Can you remove pushrods from a 1600cc Dual Port with
  out removing the head?

D'oh! I thought we were still talking about the &quot;tubes&quot;. Listen to listen to 
Mr. Connolly, I have the afternoon sleepies.

Later,

Michael Knight


&gt;From: &quot;John Connolly&quot; Yes, no problem. Just remove the valve covers then 
&gt;rocker assemblies.


&gt;the pushrod TUBES get mangled (stock ones) without removing the head, but
&gt;the PRs are no problem
