Hello All!

   We have a 68 transporter that we found in a junkyard.Lights(headlights
and parking lights) on the front work ...but nothing in the rear.Would
anyone have a diagram of a 68 fuse box and/or an emergency flasher
relay...showing what wires are where?
   Really, any info would be greatly appreciated!

Peace,
Chance and Amy
