Subject: Re: [T2] Wind Sheer

Hi Sean,

I've driven an econoline in the wind, it was no picnic. The same 
applies to early dodge caravans. The choice of a bus tire has a huge 
impact on suspension, much more so than on a &quot;domestic&quot; van. But with 
the right tires and a healthy suspension, I would rate the VW bus as 
handling at least as well if not better than any other 1-ton van of 
similar vintage. YMMV.

I think it's mostly perception: sitting above the front tire makes the 
driver more sensitive to lateral movement than if you're sitting inside 
the wheelbase. The vehicle isn't handling any worse, it's just that 
your position makes you more affected by it.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
