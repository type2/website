Subject: Re: [T2] What's the practical low end for the endplay spec?

Speaking from a gauging and measurement standpoint, I have the following
observations:
1.) The difference of .00024&quot; between the rounded off number and the
direct metric specification is really of little consequence when working
in the environment that we are all typically working in.
2.) There are many factors that can contribute to gaging error including
the measurement system (indicator, feeler gage etc.), User
interactions,environment etc.
3.) IMHO, I beleive that due to the potential for measurement error and
the fact that you do not know which way the error is likely to be
working, I would shoot for the middle of the specified range.

Hope this is of some use - Jeff

&gt; The endplay spec is 0.07mm to 0.13mm which is 0.003&quot; to 0.005&quot; according to the book specs. If you do the actual conversion it's closer to 0.00276&quot; to 0.0051&quot;. What concerned me for a while was that the rounding of the units have produced one value at the lower limit that is smaller than the other. I checked without guesswork and the metric values seem to be the baseline...
&gt; It was 0.15mm before I removed the flywheel to replace the seal and I suspect that was probably the cause of the tapping noise I used to here at startup and possibly the cause of my flywheel seal leak (got pounded by the crank).
&gt; Reseting it to 0.09mm seems a better choice to me. What do you think? I don't want to end up going too tight in practice even though it would be ok going by the book.
