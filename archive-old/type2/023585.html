Lurch is in the shop getting a nose job.  I have been by to take pictures, 
but they're still in the camera.

I got a nose from the top (3&quot; back all the way across) to the floor (about 6&quot; 
back) at a local VW show.

What they have done is to totally remove the old nose from about 3&quot; from the 
top of the pillars all the way down to the bottom corners.  It was tough!

The new (new to me) one has been cut to fit and put on, but Lurch required a 
lot of straightening, especially on the passenger's side (it had apparently 
taken a really big hit there in a previous life).  The original floor was 
then welded up to the nose (there is a brace that goes all the way across -- 
seen from the inside), the pillars were welded, and the bottom was welded at 
the corners and across the bottom to the frame (six places).  It looks rough 
(a few more pinholes showed up along the windshield sill after working on it) 
bit it was not quite finished when I saw it yesterday.  I have ordered new 
rubber for the doors and turn signals (the body shop took care of the 
windshield &amp; seal) and I think I might do the Kool Patch thing underneath.

This will be a stepwise restoration.  Currently the front back to the back of 
the cab, later the back, then the sides, and then the top -- as funds permit. 
 As soon as I set up a web page, I'll post some pics.
