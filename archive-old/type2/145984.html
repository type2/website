&gt;Well, what I'm wondering 
&gt;is if that fiber washer goes in the same place on my diz as the 010 in pic 
&gt;#8(down) . My Diz has the Bosch # 0231 170 093 - VW # 022 905 205 S. 
&gt;Although it's not exactly the same, Glen Ring's 010 overhaul site is a 
&gt;useful loose guide. But I wonder if anyone knows where an expoded view of my 
&gt;diz can be found online?

Roughly:

Your distributor needs two of those fiber washers (one inside and one between the drive dog and the body) but the repair kit only contains one:

If you only need one you can order this kit for as little as $10 from any IMC parts dealer in town or whomever you get Bosch parts from. I've been quoted as much as $20 for this kit so it depends on how they gouge you.

At one time Karl was helping me to locate this part by Mercedes pn but I didn't follow up on it.
