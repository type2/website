Sound advice Steve.  Went through the Oregon Coast Range over the
weekend, and my bus pulled along like before.  Gas mileage is up too.

Thanks

&gt; Roger,
&gt; 
&gt; As an experiment (and possible permanent mod), try this...  disconnect the
&gt; vacuum retard hose from the dist.  Cap the hose, but leave the nipple into
&gt; the vacuum can open.  Retime your bus to 7.5 BTDC at idle, vacuum advance
&gt; line attached. Try those hills again.
&gt; 
&gt; As I understand it, (from Karl (who will, I hope, correct me if I am
&gt; wrong)) at speed, the manifold vacuum and ported vacuum signals are near
&gt; equal and you get only mechanical advance. W/o the retard plugged in, you
&gt; should get some ported vacuum pulling advance and a bit more advance under
&gt; load.
