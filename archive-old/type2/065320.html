&gt;Any speculation as to some of the weird #'s:  the 71's, the 93's, and
&gt;lesser the 84's, 85's and 87's?  Myself, I have no idea...

        One could argue that '71 is the best year of the old 1600 engine,
as it has the disc brakes and the dual port intake... Many do argue this as
a matter of fact...  ;-)
