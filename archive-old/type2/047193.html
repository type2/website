Subject: RE: [T2] Aux Battery Setup

&gt; I want to be able to use the bus stereo (not there yet) and interior
&gt; lights while camping without running down the starting battery.
&gt; Creating a second electrical system off the aux battery, which wouldn't
&gt; allow the use of anything wired into it while underway, doesn't fit with
&gt; what I wanted.


You misunderstand.  When the engine is running, the relay is closed and the
two batteries are both hooked up and charging off of the alternator
simultaneously.  Therefore anything hooked up to _either_ battery will work
while you are driving.  When the engine is off, items hooked up to either
battery will still work, but only off of their respective batteries.  So the
switch setup you are proposing is unneccessary; the relay is already doing
it for you.  All you need to do (assuming the Hella dual battery relay is
installed and working) is relocate the power leads of your lights, stereo,
etc. to the aux battery (via fuses of course) and everything will work
exactly as you planned.
