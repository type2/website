&gt; With the onset of colder weather I am wondering about the oil in my beloved
&gt; 74 Riviera. It's an 1800 with about 7000 miles on a top-notch rebuild. I am
&gt; currently using Castrol 20/50 Synthetic and it works wonderfully; good
&gt; lubrication, cool running, and I don't leak a drop. Now that the mornings
&gt; are getting chill I wonder if I should go to the 10/40 weight synthetic Does
&gt; the benefit of having a lighter weight oil during cold starts outweigh the
&gt; possible increased wear at operating temps?

I run Penzoil 5W-50 synthetic!  

good cold start ability, I ski and it is cold up there in the mountains
first thing in the morning.... the gas heater warms the bus up fast to!
