Subject:  Re: [T2] Sound proofing - my version

&gt; Finally I started talking to local roofers - specifically ones that
worked
&gt; on commercial flat roofs. One very helpful fellow here in middle TN took
&gt; the time to show me the materials he uses which were mostly as you can
&gt; imagine, the standard thin tar papers.
&gt;
&gt; However he showed me a roll of modified polymer+bitchum - that is 180 mls

This sounds very much like the &quot;torch edge&quot; we sold at Grossmans's
Lumberyard (back when it was in business). It was a fiber reinforced roll
of rubber and it was called &quot;torch edge&quot; becuase you overlapped the sheets
about a 1/2 inch and then used a propane torch to melt the edges together.
Designed for use on flat roofs. never looked at it unrolled or in use, just
sold it. You know &quot;Those that can, do - those that can't, work behind the
counter selling supplies to those that can&quot;
