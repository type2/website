Howdy,

I a question about my '82 Vanagon GL Westfalia:

* I recently had the clutch rebuilt (less than 1k miles ago) and over the
past couple of days have noticed a &quot;rubbing&quot; noise (soft, like rubbing 2
pieces of slate or clay tile parallel to each other).. Description follows:

- clutch pedal makes a slight &quot;rubbing&quot; noise which I can also lightly
&quot;feel&quot; thru my foot when pedal is depressed and am shifting UP into 2nd gear
from 1st (not down)..

- &quot;rubbing&quot; noise MAY also be heard from the rear, sounds like it's coming
from the clutch plate/disk (at a loss for the proper name at the moment- big
round disk thing with springs in it) when shifting UP to 2nd from 1st (not
down).. Doesn't happen with any other gears..

Any ideas what this might be? Thanks in advance!
