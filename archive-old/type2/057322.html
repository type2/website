There is room for all types of folks here on the list, be they newbies, or
oldies, or  Bob Hoovers.  I hope to think there is room here for me too, and I
try not to over do it with my opinions and comments so I don't alienate
myself.

I've been on the lists for quite a while.  I quickly realized that there is a
lot of good advice, and a lot of poor advice here.  I root through it all
carefully and choose what I can use, or benefit from.  I, like several others
have tried occasionally to correspond privately with other list members, and
have developed some internet friendships.  I've even had the great honor of
meeting many of you in person.  But I've also had poor luck with a couple of
list members, and like the bad advice that occasionally pops up, I've learned
to ignore the messages from these people.  It's easier for me to do this than
to start flame wars.  After all, people are entitled to their opinions,
whether we agree with them or not.

I try not to be offensive or pushy.  If I offer advice, it comes from my
experience and knowledge, (most of which I've gained from this list) and I
don't offer it as fact, and I won't take offense if you don't believe it.  If
I see something incorrect posted to the list, I'll post my opinion, as I hope
someone would correct me (and they have) if I posted incorrect information.

So we should all lighten up and take a step back.  Please remember we are all
here to help and support each other.  Let's keep the subject matter to VW
buses and keeping them on the road, and helping each other out, newbies
included.

peace, love and buses,
