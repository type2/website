&gt; well technically your campmobile is based on a komi so i
&gt; guess it could be construed as stil being a kombi
&gt; 
&gt; FWIW up here you get better rates if you can convince the
&gt; Insurance Company your van is a motorhome cos I guess their
&gt; rates are based on little old lady/men that drive their
&gt; motorhome very little and then park it somewhere for a long
&gt; time and sit arounf making tacky patio lights or wood burnt
&gt; signs etc.
&gt;

FWIW

Check your state DMV office before you make such a change. Some states 
(Oklahoma for one) taxes (included in annual license fee) RV's at 
somewhere around 10+ times the rate of autos and trucks. Some owners even 
register there RV's out of state ;o}.
