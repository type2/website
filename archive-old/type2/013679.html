Subject: Bad overheating/carb
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Ok , so I was looking through my bently and trying to
remember the instructions on adjusting the carb and
what does what. Its been so long since Ive had to fool
with one that I have forgotten how to work on it.
Anyways, something strange i noticed was that the
motor kept the same idle with the idle mixture screw
all the way in and 3 turns out. If I remember
correctly it should reduce the idle the further in I
screw it . Is that correct? If I screw it all the way
in the motor should stall ?  The carb is a Solex
30/31. I Have not had this truck but a few months and
the carb was sposto have been rebuilt by a local shop
before i got it. 
Thanks----Bryan
