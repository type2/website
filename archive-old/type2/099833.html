Subject: What is the deal with H4 lamps?

Ok, I have read some stuff about H4 headlamps and all, but nothing that 
really answers my questions.

1) Are they that much brighter?
2) If they are brighter, why?
3) Do they give off a less yellow, more natural light?
4) What do you think, ....think you could get away with them not being DOT 
approved for regular use?

Thanks all.
