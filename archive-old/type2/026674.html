Subject: Low Voltage Output - Isolators, Generators, and Bosch Alternators

&gt;BTW, the better isolators get around the problem of voltage drop by
&gt;sensing the voltage downstream of the isolator.  This voltage is fed
&gt;to the alternator's regulator which fools the alternator into
&gt;producing the extra voltage needed to overcome the isolators drop.
&gt;I don't know if this applies to the VW setup, though.

George, I spoke with SurePower again and got some more information, which
I'd like to share with the list--to set the story straight.  My apologies
for any confusion I may have created.

JUST BUYING AN ISOLATOR AT YOUR LOCAL AUTOPARTS OR RV STORE AND SIMPLY
HOOKING IT UP IS NOT GOING TO WORK RIGHT!  All isolators, which are
basically just diodes (one-way circuits), lose about .7 to 1.0 volts.  Your
batteries are not going to get a full charge and your headlights, etc., are
not going to be nice and bright while the engine is running.  For Bosch
alternators, you need to convert the sensing circuit from internal to
external and use a special isolator with an extra &quot;R&quot; (regulator) terminal.
For generators, you can use the regular isolator, but if you do, you have to
bump up the voltage output setting by modifying the regulator.  These fixes
will result in correct operation and fully charged batteries.

ALTERNATORS:  

Normally, isolators are hooked up so that the external voltage regulator
senses alternator output at the battery (downstream of the isolator) so the
isolator doesn't matter.  The alternator just puts out whatever is necessary
(approx. 15 volts) so that the resulting voltage at the battery is 14 volts.

On all Bosch alternators with internal regulators (which is just about all
of them) that are used on VW's, the voltage is sensed inside the alternator,
at 14 volts, so that's the most the alternator will put out.  After losing a
volt in the isolator, loads such as your headlights and batteries only get a
maximum of 13 volts, which is inadequate to fully charge them.

The Bosch alternators need to be modified (simple operation) to disconnect
the sensing circuit from inside the alternator and route it to downstream of
the isolator.  Unfortunately, you can't just connect the sensing wire to the
battery on this setup because when the engine is off, the battery will
discharge back through this wire to the ignition circuit (through the D+
terminal on the alternator). Therefore, a special isolator is required with
a third diode, which feeds an &quot;R&quot; (regulator) terminal.  The only purpose of
this terminal is to drop the voltage by one volt so that the regulator will
be sensing the same voltage the batteries are getting, and thus force the
alternator to put out 15 volts to compensate.  I was not able to find this
special isolator anywhere and had to special order it.  The SurePower model
702R was what I got for my aftermarket 51 amp Bosch alternator kit used on
upright engines.  It's rated 70 amps, with two battery terminals, and has
the &quot;R&quot; terminal.  It cost about $30 plus shipping.  Surepower rarely sells
any of these.  They were made for the &quot;Vanagon Camper&quot; market.  It comes
with instructions on how to modify the alternator.

The instructions that come with the SurePower isolator are for Bosch
alternators with the regulator mounted on the opposite end from the pulley.
For Bosch alternators with a shaft that goes all the way through both ends
(pulley on one end and cooling air fan on the other) used for Type I upright
engines, the procedure is different.  The regulator (and brush holder
assembly) is mounted on the side. You still bend the internal connector
spring tab out of the way to disconnect the regulator sensor circuit from
the alternator output, but instead of soldering a wire to the regulator
sensor terminal, all you have to do is connect the D+ terminal to the &quot;R&quot;
terminal on the isolator.  This is because the D+ terminal on the regulator
is internally connected to the regulator sensor circuit.  (On the alternator
shown in the SurePower instructions, the D+ terminal is internally connected
to the alternator circuit.)  So what you end up with is the ignition circuit
connected to the D+ terminal as it was before, and an extra wire from the D+
terminal to the &quot;R&quot; terminal on the isolator.  Logically, you have moved the
whole system of charging light and voltage sensing away from the alternator
to downstream of the isolator--in effect the same as you would have with an
externally mounted regulator.

GENERATORS:

On pre 72 generators, the stock voltage regulators can be modified to put
out a maximum of 15 volts instead of 14, which will compensate for the
isolator voltage drop.  Basically, there is a relay with a strong spring
mounted contact.  The electromagnet charged by the generator/battery pulls
on the contact against the spring but is not able to pull it over enough to
close the circuit until the generator/battery charge reaches 14 volts, at
which point the magnet is strong enough to pull the contact against the
other contact and this switches the alternator off.  To increase the voltage
to 15 volts, you carefully bend the metal spring arm away from the other
contact.  You have to run the engine and measure the output, turn it off,
rebend the spring, retest, etc., until you get it right.  If you bend the
spring back and forth too much, you will mess it up, so bend it easy and in
small steps.  Also a good idea to make sure nothing is turned on, maybe pull
the fuses to be sure, in case you raise the voltage setting too high.

Once I figured out how this type of regulator works, I realized that as it
ages, the spring tension could change and you wouldn't get the right voltage
setting.  Sure enough, I've noticed that the older they get, the less
voltage they put out.  I guess the spring loses it's strength and needs to
be bent back periodically.  I found that is also a good time to clean the
contacts.  You might want to check the output periodically, regardless of
whether you use an isolator or not.
