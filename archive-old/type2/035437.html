Dear Postal

Knock yourself out and treat Stray to a set of chains! I've had a set for
years and have never had any problem negotiating ice and snow  (except for
the maniacs loose in their 4WD's). We also used to go &quot;jungle crawling&quot; on
our farm in the '52 my dad used for work. We went
across creeks, through the woods, up mountains with little or no road on our
way to the river for a lazy summer day at the rapids.
