Subject: replacing front 73-79 bumper with 68-72 bumper(project report)

&gt; Hello List,
&gt; 
&gt; Well it is Friday where I am at. I have waited all
&gt; week to babble about my latest vw experiences. 
&gt; One of the many projects that I have been working on
&gt; my bus is replacing my 74 bus's front bumper with that
&gt; of a 68-72 bus. Many people have inquired about how to
&gt; do this. 

It might be easier to replace it with the correct bumper.
211-707-111J  Front Bumper 1973 to 1979 Bus, New  $77.00

Thank You,
Bus Boys, Inc.
