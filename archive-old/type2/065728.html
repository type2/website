&gt; I was an apprentice technician working at a VW dealership in the first year
&gt; that the watercooled rabbits + dashers etc. came out. The factory wheel covers
&gt; were a silver plastic disk that covered the whole wheel. After a few thousand
&gt; miles I lot of brake dust with good old asbestos would be waiting for us to
&gt; blow out when we rotated tires. I can remember great clouds of dark German
&gt; brake dust floating through the shop. I don't know how much of it has left me 
&gt; in the last 20 years.

&gt; Think healthly!

A few years back, there was a spill on the Bay Bridge of some white powder,
though possibly to be asbestos.  This occurred on the lower level of the two-
tier bridge.  The bridge, the only real route across the San Fransico Bay was
closed for a day for cleanup.  The traffic jams were unbelievable.  I thought
at the time that even if it was a 50 lb. sack of asbestos that was spilled,
this was trivial compared to the air pollution caused by the excess traffic,
and that there was probably more asbestos generated by the traffic braking
than by the spill.

It was ironic as well, because the structure of the bridge on that lower level
is a wonderful gray fuzzy texture -- years of oil mixed with years of
asbestos brake lining dust completely enshroud the thing.  There must be
tons of it on the bridge.
