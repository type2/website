Subject: Regarding the &quot;new&quot; microbus...

While I was intrigued that VW was planning to &quot;bring back&quot; the microbus, I 
also knew that they would screw it up (and probably put the screws to us 
air-cooled bus drivers).

First off, I can guarantee that VWOA's trademark creeps are going to start 
actively pursuing anyone who uses &quot;bus&quot; in their domain name, especially if 
it is a VW oriented site. Watch out BusDepot, BustedBus, etc...  They did 
the same thing when the &quot;new&quot; Beetle came out, and I fully expect them to 
try to repossess the rights to anything and everything bus-related.

Second, as far as the VW &quot;dealerships&quot; go, I have yet to come across one 
that could give a rat's ass about the air-cooled vehicles that built their 
franchises. Hell, most of the VW &quot;dealers&quot; have only recently jumped on the 
VW bandwagon -- the two in my immediate area were Ford/Lincoln/Mercury and 
Dodge dealerships until just a few years ago. I probably wouldn't have much 
of a bitch with them, except that they only want to see an air-cooled VW 
when they're having shows and want to attract crowds. The rest of the time, 
they only want you around if you're planning on spending $20K plus on a new 
one. And don't even get me started about the attitudes in their parts and 
service departments. Most of their mechanics wouldn't know how to change the 
oil in a real bus or bug, let alone do anything that requires brains.

As far as the &quot;new microbus&quot; is concerned, from what I've seen it has 
absolutely none of the charm or charisma of the original. Who wants a $20K+ 
piece of plastic? Probably the same people who would fork over $200 a head 
to attend a sanitized reunion tour of their favorite Sixties group. Can you 
picture folks like that caravaning or camping in their &quot;new&quot; bus? I can just 
see the rows of generators and imagine all the bitching about the lack of 
bottled-water/chardonnay selections. I know that there's a segment of the 
list here that doesn't like the &quot;hippie bus&quot; moniker (or some of the 
un-factory paint jobs out there), but think about it -- other than some 
magnetic or vinyl stick-on flowers, how creative do you think these &quot;new&quot; 
bus owners will be when it comes to personalizing their rides? Even if they 
did, how &quot;personal&quot; can you make something that looks like it just drove off 
the &quot;BladeRunner&quot; movie set?

Okay... I think my rant is over. My apologies if I've offended, but I really 
needed to get that off my chest. Needless to say, my opinion of the &quot;new&quot; 
bus is a definite &quot;thumbs-down&quot;. When this abomination comes out, I just may 
put my 10-inch chrome VW badge up for sale on E-bay and replace it with a 
spare tire. I love my bus, but I'm so sick of VWOA and its parent that I 
could just scream.

Peace and love, folks...

Sean,

1970 Microbus (&quot;Mimi&quot;)
