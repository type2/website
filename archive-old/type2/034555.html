Show is only two weeks away!

Web site is at:

  http://www.oldvolks_dot_com/events/BBB/

If you have any problems connecting to that web site, please let me know.  I
had one report and it cleared-up later... but wanted to see if there were
any other problems.

Does anyone have any info or a website about this?  I saw the flight info a
while ago, but just need info on the show, gathering, whatever.
Thanks-
