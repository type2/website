&gt;Is anyone going to the NOPI Nationals in Atlanta this next weekend?
&gt;If so I would like to meet some of you in person.
&gt;
&gt;Charlie Ford

For those who don't already know, NOPI *used to* have the best VW 
event in Georgia, when it was the NOPI Bug Off.  For the past three 
or so years VW's have been a *miniscule* part of the &quot;NOPI Nationals&quot;.

Be forewarned that there may only be a dozen air-cooled VW's in 
attendance.  The locals (other than the Hunter's who build exotic 
show cars) have been boycotting the show, so almost any air-cooled 
you see will be from out of town.  All the vendors I talked to last 
year said they lost money on the show.

The Meyer brothers are in the &quot;big time&quot; now, and the vast majority 
of the show will be mini-trucks, lowriders, monster-trucks, hot-rods, 
street cars, loud stereos, Elvis impersonators, etc.

If that is what you are into, go and have a good time...  just don't 
expect to see many air-cooled VW's.  Sure Hot VW's and VW Trends will 
be there for a photo shoot and you will see pictures of the Hunter's 
ZZ-Top bug and whatever the hell that Pink &amp; Purple bug they built is, 
but NOPI buys 2 color page ads from them every month.  ;)

The &quot;NOPI Nationals&quot; is another example of the downward spiral that 
the Vintage Volkswagen community finds themselves in.  Our only 
recourse is in our grassroots holding of our own shows.  The &quot;Big 
Boys&quot; are chasing the $$$ and they have decided it is not coming 
from us.

Will I be going?  Once again I penciled in September 21-22 as the 
weekend for my annual toenail clipping, so I will be unable to 
attend.  ;)

Stepping down from my soapbox (being careful not to break a toenail),

Dave
