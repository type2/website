Subject: [T2] bilge pump blowers
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

I have been running one for 3 years and am due for a new
one. I installed mine as far forward as possible to
minimize the heat on the blower. While I wont say it hasnt
had an effect on the fan over time... it did last 3 years.
Its worth the price for the amount of heat you get. I have
been looking for a higher end fan then what you normally
find but havent had any luck. Soooo I will just buy another
and install it. 
Short version.... mine didnt melt.


. With the talk of melting plastic in 
the heat channel 
has anyone melted their blower ?

My dog is usually pleased with what I do, 
because he is not infected with the concept of what I &quot;should&quot; be doing.
