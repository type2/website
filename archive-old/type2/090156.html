Subject: Re: [T2] Hard Start/Won't Start When Warm

Hello,

I don't have much experience on this matter but my
auto shop teacher was explaining to us how carburetors
worked and this sounds like it could be a problem with
the choke sticking open making the mixture too lean to
start the vehicle. Any thoughts???? 

One question, when you try to start the vehicle after
you have cut it off, when it finially does crank, does
a large cloud of black smoke come from the tail pipe?
If so, your idle cut off switch is probably not
working. One more thing, check your spark plugs for
blackening. Your spark plugs may be fouled out.

Well, that is all I can think of. Good luck. If you
have any more questions, I will try to contribute what
I know. Have a good day!

&gt; Friends,
&gt; 
&gt; I've been creeping around the archived messages
&gt; looking for some insight
&gt; on this problem with no luck.
&gt; 
&gt; Basically, my '70 loaf will start up great in the
&gt; morning.  After it's
&gt; been warmed up (let's say I've driven 20 minutes or
&gt; so) then shut off...
&gt; 
&gt; [elapsed time ~20 minutes]
&gt; 
&gt; ...I try to start it and the engine just won't
&gt; catch.  It turns over
&gt; just fine, but it has a tough time firing up.  When
&gt; I go around back and
&gt; open up the engine room, it smells like gas (and no,
&gt; I'm not pumping it
&gt; full of gas while trying to start it).
&gt; 
&gt; Sometimes, simply opening the engine room door then
&gt; trying  to start it
&gt; again works.  Sometimes not...now that the weather
&gt; is warming up, it's
&gt; become a more frequent problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately for me, this usually happens to my
&gt; girlfriend when she's
&gt; driving it, and instead of rationally thinking of
&gt; what the problem may
&gt; be, she freaks out all over me.
&gt; 
&gt; So, there it is.
&gt; 
&gt; Any thoughts on what may be preventing the thing
&gt; from firing up would be
&gt; appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Enjoy,
&gt; --
