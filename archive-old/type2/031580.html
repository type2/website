&gt; Engine: AVP rebuilt type IV 1800 with around 7000 miles, maintained to order

first problem, yer not driving it enough ;8*}

&gt; On a 250 mile trip the other week I started getting a &quot;ping&quot; during
&gt; acceleration in 4th gear. I had just put gas in around 60 miles earlier and
&gt; every thing seamed fine, the engine was no hotter than usual, the only thing

I would have first suspected &quot;bad&quot; gas and stopped and topped up with
highest octane avaliable to help boost the average octane in tank.

&gt; is I had put a tad to much oil in and it was to the top of the second line?

shouldn't have been enough over to cause problems
&gt; 
&gt; Same pinging except this time under load in 2nd, 3rd, and 4th until speed
&gt; was obtained, then only pinging when I put the engine under load.

sure sign of low octane?

&gt; After driving for another 40 miles I noticed I was loosing power, no pops or
&gt; bangs, just no power, so I drift to the side of the road.

?????? hmmmmm

&gt; In a state of, &quot;o ship yards what do I do&quot; I find the engine is very hot now

points wearing and retarding the engine?????

&gt; However toward the end of this drive I start getting what sounds like a
&gt; exhaust leek at slower speeds and start off in all gears, although I no
&gt; longer get the Pinging in 4th gear under load.
&gt; 
&gt; The next morning I talk to a vw mechanic and he thinks I have &quot;dropped a
&gt; Valve&quot; exactly what he had happen to a AVP engine he installed, however it
&gt; happened in less than 2000 miles. He suggest I drop back the timing which I
&gt; do along with adjusting the valves again after less than 500 miles since the
&gt; last adjustment, and yes they where TIGHT!

??? huh, changing the timing has an effect on valve lash.

but AVP and other rebuilders _MAY_ be using standard auto valve seats, my
machinist (and I) found that these are not hard enough for an air cooled
engine, the valves ate into the seat and were grinding thier way all the
way through the seat.

he now puts in Diesel engine seats, about 4 times more expensive but they
should handle the heat better or so he thinks, so far none have been
damaged by the valve.  will let you know more in a 100,000 miles or so


&gt; time the pinging in all gears is less, but in 4th gear I have PLENTY of
&gt; power under load, in fact have to pass a few trucks and do so with no
&gt; problems. The engine stays cool and we make it home with no major problems,
&gt; thank you HOSS!

that was the timing and valve lash which you &quot;corrected&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; So if you have made it this far I hope I have given enough info for someone
&gt; to give me a guess as what has happened and more importantly what will it
&gt; take to correct this?

take off your rocker assembly.  sight or use a straight edge along the
tops of the valves,  they should be all the same height, if some,
especially exhaust are higher it is a sign that you have either valve or
valve seat wear.  probably head pull time..

if all are even change to the next higher octane gas for a while and see
if that helps. it is just now about the time that gas goes to a different
formula for the summer here in the East, and probably many other areas so
this could be having an effect, and it is cheap and easy to check. 

I find I need 89 octane in mine in the summer so I just run it year round
and my C/R is quite low

basically I think you may have 3 seperate problems

. bad gas
. bad timing/valve lash
. possible valve seat problem, 

I would check em in that order


&gt; I do owe a BIG THANK YOU to Brian, he owns a 74 or so camper and actually
&gt; stopped to offer assistance, however the tow truck came shortly after he

aren't Bus folks great!?!?

good luck
Bob
