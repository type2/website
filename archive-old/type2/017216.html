Joe:

&gt;How close are the sets for a 2000 and an 1800?

I just went out to the garage and rooted through my trash can, since it
was only the other day that I threw away the packaging from my last
gasket set ('78 2.0L Type IV).  I retrieved the label from it.

This set was by &quot;elring&quot;, their number 109.177 and is marked:

  Typ 2/68, 127 Industrie-Motor
  412, 914/4
  1,8 Ltr 50/52/55/63 kW (68/70/75/85 PS) ab 1973 -&gt;
  Typ 2/68
  2,0 Ltr 51.5 kW (70 PS) ab 1976 -&gt;

I interpret this to mean the set will accomodate '73 onwards 68-85hp
1800 engines, and '76 onwards 70hp 2.0 liter engines.

The excess unused pieces that didn't apply to my 2.0 liter have been
dispersed among my collections as individual pieces now, so I can't say
what all was in there for the 1800 that wasn't used on the 2.0  Not
much, as I recall.

In this case, the same set serviced 1800 and 2000cc.  However, it occurs
to me that the package contents could possibly vary depending upon the
manufacturer of the set.
