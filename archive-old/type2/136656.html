Subject: Re: [T2] towin a bus with a Pontiac 6000

is that pony front wheel drive &gt;???????
i wouldnt tow anything with front wheel drive if it is?
400 miles? up hill or downhill makes a difference...
a bus without a engine in it can be very light though depends upon whatelse is in it...
try a tow bar if you get the chance keep all four tires on the ground wont put such a hard strain on the pony...
peace
chris

hi

I wonder if i could tow (dolly or flatbed) a bus with my pontiac 6000 1988,
2.5 L iron duke ?

The bus is not a westy, its a bus, no engine probably

Is this possible over 400 miles?

Peace and Love
