Subject: Re: Engine removal question.

All this talk of T4 buses has me scared witless... It
took 6 hours with me and a guy that works on american
cars to pull and install a T2 engine in a 68 Westy.  I
have a chance to buy a pair of T4 buses, one needs to
have the engine/trans of the other.  I am not sure
that I am up the the task of swapping the T4s... I
guess if I buy, then I will learn.  Thanks for the
posts on this topic, it is educational.

&gt; &gt; &gt; So here I sit.. dirty, tired and greasy, with my
&gt; engine half out of my 
&gt; &gt; bus.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm stuck, I'm cursing at myself loudly, and I
&gt; think I might have 
&gt; &gt; called the
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I managed to pull the engine as far as I can to
&gt; the rear apron. and now
&gt; &gt; &gt; looking between the engine and trans I see (a
&gt; mile I guessed in anger) the
&gt; &gt; &gt; input shaft seemingly has gotten longer... or
&gt; its coming out of the trans.
