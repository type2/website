Subject: Re: [T2] Whistling Bus - The new guy finally fixed his own bus

It didn't make it run any better because by that time I had screwed with 
everything else and had my spark plug firing order messed up pretty bad, I 
do not have any noticable vacuum leaks now, no whistling, everything back 
where it should be.

It was unplugged because it popped off from the way that I stuttered it when 
I started it, it wasn't unplugged on purpose.

Thanks

&gt;&gt; it didn't make it run any better.
&gt;
&gt; I doubt that it would.  The only reason someone
&gt; would disconnect it (and hopefully plug the
&gt; engine end) would be if it had a leak and was
&gt; causing the bus to run poorly.
