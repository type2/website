Subject: Re: [T2] Maaco (was Re: Anonymous threatening letters)

Hi Miles,

MAACO painted my camper for $350CDN back in 2001, and the paint still 
looks good. I did my own prep, and that saved a lot of coin and kept 
the price reasonable.

The paint hasn't flaked off anywhere, and the rust repairs I did in 
2000 are still holding up well.

Unfortunately, there were some spots hiding under the PO's paint, and 
they're surfacing now, but all in all it was a good investment for me. 
But back in September I painted my wife's bus with tremclad and a spray 
gun and compressor, and I was quite happy with the way it turned out. 
If I'd been brave enough to use more valuable paint I would have been 
thrilled, but it'll do for now, and it looks fine to me.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
