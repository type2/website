&gt;I prefer the hydraulics as I'm not into adjusting every 3K miles on my 77 bus because I'm not as spry as I used to be.

I find that hydraulics still require periodic adjustment, say 10-15k miles. See my tech article on them for more info:

http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/HydraulicLifters.html

Poor idling in the morning and popping from the exhaust with a warm engine are usually clues you need to adjust them.

&gt;I can use a magnet to pull out the solid lifters after removing the tubes, correct?

Yes. Telescoping works best.

&gt;Then replace with new hydraulics.

The lifters both have the same size bore.

&gt;Do I also need hydraulic push rods then?, or are they the same as solid lifter push rods?

The hydraulic push rods are stronger and a different length so dont' mix and match, use hydraulic rods.
