&gt; Hi Tom,
&gt; Hmm, does your new muffler have the stock preheat bubbles that exchange heat
&gt; off of the #2 &amp; #4 exaust pipes.  If so you need the 1-1/2&quot; long sheetmetal

I'm not sure I understand what you mean by bubbles.  There is no preheater
outlet from the muffler.  

I'm just trying to link the paper/foil tubes from the fan housing/blower
to the rear of the heat exchangers.  I do have the tube connectors (they
feel a bit heavier than sheet metal) that I believe are used on either
side of the rear tin.  However, the rear opening on the heat exchangers is
too close to the tin to allow for me to install a paper/foil tube from the
underside of the rear tin to the opening on the heat exchanger.

Does that make sense?  The PO has done a good bit of hacking on the rear
tin, which might just allow me run the paper/foil tube right from the
blower outlet to the exchanger itself.

I'll see if that works.  Otherwise, I need some temperature resistant
tape:)

Cheers,

Tom
