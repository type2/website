Subject: Re: [T2] 34 PICT-3 manufacturers

    In looking through various parts supplier web sites, it seems that
34PICT-3's
    are available made by either BOCAR or BROSAL. Is there any reason to
stay away
    from one or the other? Are there other manufacturers that might be
better?

    Thanks,
    Bill Moon


Hi,

I have a BOCAR on my 56 Beetle (its got a 1600 in it), it was put on about
8000 mile ago and works well. I also have one on my 70 Westy, it only has
about 100 miles on it and it works well as well.

Joey.
