&gt; &gt;1.  When pulling off the flexible couplings to the heat exchangers, I got a
&gt; &gt;face full of something which looks a lot like asbestos.  Does anyone have
&gt; &gt;any idea if a '77 would have had asbestos in the heating system?
&gt; .  I'm considering a high-end rebuild from Gary's VW in San Diego, because
&gt;
&gt; There is a pair of white asbestos collars between the flexible hose and the heater flapper boxes as seen here:

&gt;
&gt; Do not breathe, handle with gloves, etc.  It's evil stuff especially if it's disturbed.

As an environmental hazard (as in a workplace, home, etc.), asbestos is a
hazard, but only in a long-term sense.  A one-time exposure from your VW
isn't a concern as long as you don't make a habit of it.

In other words, Don't Panic!

George
