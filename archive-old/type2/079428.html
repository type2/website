Subject: Re: [T2] Failing to start when warm?

Hi John Here
take a look at your coil wires on the -side. Now +side anything loose? Check 
the cut 
off for the carb. The wire goes from the coil to the carb. Is that loose?  
How about
the cut off switch, is that screwed into the carb snug? Other than that look 
for
vacuum leaks.                              JPB2001
