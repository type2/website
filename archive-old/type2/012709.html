The Bus came with out a padded dash in Europe. I do not know if it was all
buses or just some model. The padded dash is basicly the same as the non
padded, but they added a few extra hole to allow the foam pad to have something
to attach to. If you grind off all the pad, you will need to fill all of these
holes. A lot of work, but possible. Take a look at the Euro Bus web pages and
you will see what I mean. Also look up under your dash and you will see all the
holes you will need to fill.

&gt; Hello list
&gt; 
&gt; I have a question about a 1973 dash for my bus. My
&gt; Dash board is padded of course, but the padded vinyl
&gt; cover is beyond repair. My question is, can I pull
&gt; this cover off and just prime and paint the metal
&gt; underneath? I have seen earlier model busses with
&gt; painted metal dash boards and i was wondering if the
&gt; late model bus dash boards were basically the same
&gt; except with a padded vinyl cover on it. has any one
&gt; tried this before? Thanks!
