Subject: Re: [T2] microbus news

&lt;50 years ago the first Volkswagen bus left
the production line and it is now returning to
Hanover. The Volkswagen bus was never just a means of
transport, it has always been an emotive cult object.&gt;

C'mon VW - don't do this fad car thing again. Fads never last and why invest billions to build a car that might have fad status for 5-6 years. Build something versatile. Of course we all know it is going to cost $30K so for me it's a moot question of whether I will ever own one. T'ain't worth it...
