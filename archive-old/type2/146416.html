Subject: Re: [T2] tartan fabric needs

Hi Alan,

You may already have the fabric you need:

If you flip the upstairs mattress over you will find a piece of  
virtually BRAND NEW tartan big enough to recover both the front  
seats. Replace that section with a piece of denim or whatever... it's  
on the bottom side of the upstairs mattress so it's not like anyone  
will notice. The underside of the rear cushion is another good donor  
spot but that one is usually a bit more faded.

An upstairs cushion is a great find at a swap meet. If yours has  
already been scavenged then this is the next best bet.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
