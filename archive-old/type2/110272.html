Subject: Re: [T2] ' 79 bus egr?

My theory was the Speedo face was left over from the ' 78 model. Maybe they 
just replaced the CAT lens with a OXY lens and added the circuit for the OX 
switch.
At any rate there is no bulb or socket, soooo, never mind. I just hope I 
don't
have to explain this to the smog guy. Thanks.
