Subject: sink question

I have a 72 camper, and was wondering on the sink, what the handle is
for next to the facet?  There is a switch on the right side of the sink
for the pump to pump the water.  Is the handle, with a black ball-like
piece of rubber on the end, a hand pump?

If anyone could help, I would appriciate it.
