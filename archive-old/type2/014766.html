Someone correct me if I am wrong, but on a 68, once you remove the axle nut,
the only thing to keep you from pulling the axle out the back(toward the
middle of the Bus) is the CV joint. If you pull the CV the stub axle should
slid right out. 
Now, if you put the drum back on and you torque the nut to spec and still
have movement, now you have a real problem. (bad bearings, drum bottoming
out on the splines, bad stub axle....)
This only applies to 70 and older, as the 71-up you leave the hub on after
pulling the drum off (two parts, not one)

Subject:	[T2] What keeps rear axle from sliding?

I am in the middle of doing my rear brakes and CV's and I noticed that my
right axle moves in and out freely while my left axle has only millimeters
of play. What is the mechanism to keep the axle from sliding in and out
(besides having the wheel attached) ?
