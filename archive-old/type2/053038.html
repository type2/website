Yes, power is definitely low, very sluggish, and if I hold off the wires for
the left side of the engine, there's no difference at idle or higher rpm's,
so I'd say running on 2. In fact, at idle she rocks and sounds just like Mr.
Muir's sound at http://www.volks_dot_net/muir/missingon2.wav , which he
identifies as running on 2 and suggests it's low compression, possibly a
tight valve. So I'm also going to check for that. Since it's a new engine,
maybe a valve or two tightened up again since the last adjustment?

I'll try your test with the gas, though I think you mean the driver's side
carb.

The distributor cap's contacts all look about the same: scored, but I'm not
sure what to look for. I am getting sparks from the top of #3 &amp; #4 when I
take off the wires at the cap.

Thanks for the suggestions,
Victor
