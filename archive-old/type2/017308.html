&gt; The numbers on the belts are 9.5 x 905 L and made by
&gt; Continental.  I know one or several of you have these numbers in your
&gt; head.......I don't!
&gt; Are these belts most likely for my ' 69 bug, or for the bus?  I either
&gt; have a couple spares, or some belts I don't need........or could they be
&gt; for the ' 69 but would fit the bus?
This is for the older upright, the 905 is length in mm.  As mentioned by
another poster, the 2L will need a longer (965?).  Actually, you can
make a 900 to 910 work, most of the time.
