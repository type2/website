What's the consensus on mufflers, extractors, etc. for the Type 4
w/FI? I've always favored extractors, but haven't found anything quiet
enough to suit me, plus the FI system wants an EGR connection. It's
possible to drill a hole and weld on a fitting for EGR, of course, but
still I'd like something a little more quiet. My most recent exhaust is
one of the &quot;GT Sports System&quot; #938-733 from RMMW. Before that I had one
like the #938-734 but from MOFOCO. The latter was too loud to suit me,
and I thought that the dual mufflers of the &quot;GT&quot; would be quieter. It's
not, it's louder. Plus one of the welds broke already and I had to send
it back and get a new one, after only 4 months. 8-(
    So I'm wondering if, with FI, there is any significant advantage to
the extractor in terms of power and mpg?  The previous poster complained
of rough running when cold -- I don't mind that because I firmly believe
you should warm the sucker up a bit before driving away. But noise I
don't like -- in fact, I think all motor vehicles should be absolutely
silent. I recall a friend's new BMW bike which was so quiet that when it
was sitting there idling, the only way you could tell if it was running
or not was to either feel it or look at the tach. All vehicles should be
that quiet.
