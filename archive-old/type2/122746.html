&gt; way of saying: gross)  Anyhow, what would be everybody's suggestion for
&gt; cleaning these things up for painting?

I had a couple of spare wheels that I practiced the procedure that I'll 
be using for restoring my wheels.  The procedure that I used:

	1. Wire wheel as much rust as possible off.

	2. Wash metal with lacquer thinner.

	3. Use Naval Jelly to work off any remaining rust.

	4. Let dry overnight after rinsing off the final application of NJ.

	5. Wash metal with lacquer thinner once more to make sure the surfaces
	   are clean.

	6. Apply Krylon gray metal primer.

	7. Wait one hour.

	8. Apply Ace anti-rust enamel (aluminum metal-look color).

	9. Wait 24 hours.

	10. Apply Krylon Crystal Clear clear coat.  (I used gloss; you may 
choose
	    to use satin to more closely match the stock finish.)  Krylon 
claims
	    this stuff won't yellow.

The clear coat served two purposes:

	1. Metal-look enamels aren't very hard, even though they say &quot;enamel&quot;.
	   The Krylon is pretty tough.

	2. The clear over the metal-look seems to have fairly closely 
approximated
	   the stock look.  Perhaps satin would have been closer, but I think 
they
	   turned out OK.

Here are links to photos of the 2 practice wheels.  One is before step 
10, one is after step 10 (and waiting an hour for the finish to set up 
enough to be photo-worthy).

Note that I didn't bother masking the tires at all... both of these 
tires have cuts in them, and I was more interested in the 
cleaning/painting procedure.  In all, I think they turned out pretty 
well, and it wasn't that difficult to do.

When I do this procedure &quot;for real&quot;, I'll mask the tires.  I plan on 
also having new tires installed shortly after the wheel restore is 
done.  I'll have to touch-up the spots where the old wheel-balance 
weights come off, but that shouldn't be a big deal.
