&gt;&gt;it is reasonably  common  to fit a light 'bull' bar to your
&gt;&gt;bus.  This is a device made from  2&quot; steel pipe (about 1/4&quot;
&gt;&gt;wall thickness).  Imagine a piece of pipe which  attaches
&gt;&gt;to the longtiudinal chassis rail, runs out just past the
&gt;&gt;bumper,  bends upwards at 90 degrees (vertical to ground)
&gt;&gt;has another 90 degree bend  (horizontal to ground) runs
&gt;&gt;across the front of the bus, and then back down  to connect
&gt;&gt;to the other longitudinal rail.  Then has another two
&gt;&gt;horizontal  pieces which extend past these verticals to
&gt;&gt;protect the headlights, which  are also gently bent back to
&gt;&gt;floow the contour of the nose.....&lt;Snip&gt;(sorry, the ascii 
didn't come out right at all here)                    
 Spare wheels are commonly
&gt;&gt;attached to the bull bar, rather than to the  panels on the
&gt;&gt;front of the bus....also very handy for protecting that 
&gt;&gt;precious nose from  hits....they are actually not as butt
&gt;&gt;ugly as you might  think (based on certain ascii art
&gt;&gt;renditions anyway) when properly finished  with curves
&gt;&gt;etc.....and of course, they unbolt reasonably quickly...  
&gt;&gt;Never seen anything like this here in the States.....would
&gt;&gt;there be a  market for this type of thing or are you all
&gt;&gt;reeling in horror at the very  thought?  Or (maybe) there
&gt;&gt;could be legislation which prohibits them?  (hazard to
&gt;&gt;pedestrians or similar?). If anyone is interested I could
&gt;&gt;try  and find a pic of a bus thus equipped........   ????

I have seen just such a beastie in Seattle at the 
&quot;Octobugfest&quot; in (of all months) October.  It was not a show 
car (by any stretch)  And was out in the impromptu swap 
meet/parking lot area.  There wasn't any apparent owner 
hanging around to brag about his (or her) baby, so I don't 
know whose it was.  But I have to say (at the risk of 
offending said owner, if they're on the server) that it _was_ 
butt ugly.  Probably due to wear and tear and the fact that 
the area between the spare tire mount (up front) and the nose 
of the bus was being used as a luggage rack and the luggage 
was a motley assortment of muddy crap tied down with manic 
amount of twine.  But as I said, it was not being shown as a 
show car, and I am not a member of that school of VW thought 
that says &quot;Make all things perfect or don't call thyself a VW 
lover&quot;.  I would love to see pix of the real thing in a more 
pristine state! bring it on.
