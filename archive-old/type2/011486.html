Hey there Volks,

With Summer slowly fading, the last of this years New England VW
events are coming up in the RI/MA area. Trying to plan my schedule,
this is what I found. 

The first is the Rhode Island Volkswagen Associations Labor Day
weekend car show (Sunday 9/3). Details can be found here:

Campers on Cape Cod is happening Sept 29th thru the 1st of Oct.

Then there is Transporter Fest on Sunday Oct. 1st in Brookline, MA.

There is also a vw show on Martha Vineyard Island MA on Oct. 8th.
Email addy and phone# is on the LiMBO events page:

And although Pennslyvania is not technically located in New England,
I'd figured I'd add Busses By The Trail, in mid-Oct.

Mapquest_dot_com says that it will take me only 5hrs 39mins to get to
Lenhartsville PA, Hmmmmm..... If I take the Friday off...
