Subject: Re: [T2] What's the buzz... (electrical problem)

Barry,

Your last line

&gt; ( and 2/10/50 amp battery charger, and jumper cables, and volt
&gt; multi-meter(s), and bottle of vinegar, and wire brush . . . )


Should read &quot;baking soda&quot; instead of vinegar so that you neutralize the 
battery acid instead of adding to it with the acid from the vinegar.

As for the battery &quot;leak&quot; you are just gonna have to do the Sherlock 
Holmes thing...very methodically and carefully.  Don't worry about the 
speaker buzz cause the charger puts out enough stray 60 cycle ac hum to
overide almost anything around!

Cheers, dave

&gt; I did not hear any buzz from the front speakers, but the radio was set to 
&gt; fade to the rear.  I will try this again (nice day) for the front speakers, 
&gt; see if they buzz too.
&gt; 
&gt; Any hints??
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you.
