X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

Anyone with a M I G welder can weld a stainless exhaust,, if your not fussy
about the appearance, just use the normal wire in the machine.     the weld
surface will rust ,,
If your fussy,, you should use stainless wire,  YMMV

&gt;You might be able to have your cracked mainfold welded.  That is what I had
&gt;done to mine.  If it is a '79, it is stainless steel, so whoever welds it
&gt;must be able to weld stainless.
