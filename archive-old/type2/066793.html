Subject: welding

Excuse me while I rant, but perhaps this will be of use to somebody. If so, 
it will make me feel better.
So, I'm working on putting my 70 Westy back on the road. I've decided to do 
most of the worlk myself--rebuild the engine, fix the body, maybe even paint 
the thing. I'm committed to buying tools and learning to use them instead of 
paying someone else to do the work, which to my reckoning costs about as 
much, but it's a one-time deal.
In that spirit, I bought a small arc welder. A Lincoln. Runs on standard 
house current. Very nice unit. Cost on sale: $299. BUT--that's for the 
flux-cored process (self-shielded wire). It's not a MIG unit. And, of course 
I find out later, flux-cored doesn't work well on thin sheet metal such as 
VWs and all other cars out there on the road are made off. It burns holes 
right through the metal. Not cool.
     So I cough up another $130 for the adapter to make the welder into a 
MIG unit, and ANOTHER $120 for a bottle or shielding gas. (For those of you 
out there who know even less about welding than I do, you have to protect 
the weld from air while you make it, otherwise it will be weak). I should 
have shopped around. In my haste, I paid 2x what I should have for the 
shielding gas--the adapter is a fixed price. Industrial supply places 
apparently can spot a sucker coming from a mile off, so shop around.
     Now I've got a $550 MIG welder that I have to learn to use on thin 
sheet metal. The cardinal rule of welding I have learned thus far: the 
thinner the metal, the harder to weld. I could still ruin my bus and be 
stuck with a tool for which I have little use.
There. Now I feel better.
