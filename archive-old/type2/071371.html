 I have a LHD '76 high-top, a German model. All European busses seem to have
 been fitted with the upright (beetle) type engine. Some 1700-2000cc engines
 are around, but for us they are not the norm. &gt;&gt;

i recieved this message from a fellow member of the list......i originally was
interested in putting a beetle engine in my 72 van..( recently aquired cheap!!
with no engine).......it seems that this is a factory set up at least in
europe.  why is it that when i have posted a question to numerous companies
and individuals everyone ( except one person)  gave me this long story about
how it wouldnt work or would be underpowered and time consuming to retrofit.
so the question now is does anyone with some knowledge on this subject have
real info and facts to tell me if i need to find some special parts or
adapters to put my beetle engine in my 72.  will the clutch, press. plate, t/o
bearing all work?? it seems to me ( by a simple measurement that it will )
both use a 200mm plate.  anyways i would appreciate some responses on this ( a
rebuilt beetle engine can run a fraction of the cost of a type iv
rebuild)........from some who have done it and how long the are using
it....reliability, power, cost, time involved etc.                  thank you.
