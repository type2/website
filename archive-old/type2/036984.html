Subject: canvas relacement page

Hello all,

As I recall there used to be a site with photos of a canvas replacement on a 
71 westy from an old vw magazine.  It WAS in the library but isn't anymore.  
Any ideas where it went?  I thought it was www.poptop_dot_com but THAT turned out 
to be wrong.

Thanks for the help,

Eric
