Subject: Re:cheep tools

but if you do use the cheap tools, please wear eye protection - that
usually low-carbon steel the slavelabor factory uses has a bad tendency to
crack, and i've had quite a few  sockets spit a chunk when  put under high
torque!

in fact, we're s'posed to wear eye protection even w/ snap-on :)
