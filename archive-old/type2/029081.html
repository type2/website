Back in May my Wife, the two dogs and I took off for what we had hoped would
be a relaxing short beach vacation. Unfortunately about 20 miles after
filling up with gas my bus started to ping under load. I was not in the
Correct Thinking Mode to realize I needed to adjust my timing, bad gas or
something?

Any way we made it to the beach and had a great time in-between me under the
bus working,we also made the 350 mile trip back home safely, Thanks to Hoss!

I had written the list thinking I had dropped a valve seat, then I thought I
might have a warped head ?

The engine was now giving a &quot;chirp chirp&quot; when I would start it. This turned
out to be a Blown Head Gasket that had melted when my engine overheated
while it was pinging. I had hoped that this would be all I had to replace,
however after pulling the # 4 piston, the one with the blown gasket I saw
something HORRIBLE, the piston had scored 4 deep gashes into the piston
walls and the piston was very discolored, I still can't believe it didn't
lock up, another example of our busses caring about getting us home!

I want to thank Jake Raby for spending about 45 minutes talking to me
helping me understand what happened and what they do to help prevent this in
their engine rebuilds, Correct Carbs and Dizzy! Also a thanks to Dave
Wolfanger who gave me the encouragement to look into the problem until my
&quot;REAL&quot; mechanic could give it a look. A final Thanks to my mechanic who put
my new pistons and cylinders on, along with the heads.

Hoss is now up and running and seams to be doing fine, I still have the 009
dizzy and the 32dfav carb but hope to correct those soon. I'm currently
advanced timed at 32 BTDC and hope this will run the engine cooler?

Thanks for listening!

Meredith
