Subject: WTB OG Sauerbraten Aroma

&gt; From: craig k &lt;vwbus_at_ckoon_dot_org&gt;
&gt; perhaps that is why we see fewer 'help me fix this on my bus' posts
&gt; on vintagebus, and more 'can you help me find some OG sauerbraten
&gt; fart smell to put in my 63 deluxe's seat cushions?' only the
&gt; hobbyists remain.

Few people are aware of the M-series designations for both Sauerbraten 
and Wienerschnitzel (used with the mesh grey interior), which of course 
changed slightly from 63 to 64 when they went from &quot;small-butt&quot; to 
&quot;big-butt&quot; versions.  A number of coachworks supplied one-off aromatics 
such as HundertLagers mit Bratwurst, which is highly sought after.  
Using contemporary repops like Pulled Pork and, of course, Baked Beans 
-- the NAPA of replacement seat scent sources -- marks you as a 
plebeian and will make most purists hold their noses.

Thanks for reminding us of those finer details that separate the 
hobbyist from the mere driver, Craig. ;-)  (I laughed so hard I 
inadvertently dosed my recliner.)
