Hi Joel
The plug you refer to is in an oil drilling in the case that goes from
the pump to the  cooler or filter. The fix is to remove the plug and tap
the hole with the proper size pipe tap, (3/8 I think) and install a
flush pipe plug. The flush type plug can be obtained from a
refergeration shop, most hardware stores do not have the flush type
plugs. You must use grease on the tap and go very slowly to avoid
getting chips in the engine.
The plug can be removed by drilling a small hole in it and using a large
wood or sheet metal screw in the hole to extract it. Again, you must use
grease on the drill and clean out the hole . I do not think that oil in
that drilling goes through the ilter so no chips allowed.
Any well equipped mechanic could do this but I personally would not
trust them to be clean enough. I have a type 4used for racing and all of
the pressed in plugs have been replaced with pipe plugs. This is
standard racing practice.
Hope this helps, Jack
