Subject: Re: Gas Heaters According to Kath  :-)

So, Kath, I guess the next question is the one somebody else alluded to
earlier in this thread:  How much electricity does your SW heater draw?

Well, don't answer, 'cause while I was writing this I called Joe at JB
and he was REAL polite (and remembers you well, Kath!) and told me they draw
6 amps.  That's alot, and this would only be suitable on a second battery.
But a charged second battery should be able to crank out 6 amps for quite
a long while.  All Westies really should have a second battery anyhow, and
all Vanagons have a spot for one, which ain't true about propane tanks.

He seems to dislike propane heaters (&quot;Don't sell'em, don't recommend 'em&quot;,
says Joe).  He likes the Stewart Warner fine, doesn't seem to warm towards
the BA-4/6 series, but does work on them, I gathered.

His address is

JB's Heater Service
2162 Vinyard
Castle Rock, CO 80104

The full kit that Kath spoke of is $600, so perhaps a little more expensive,
but then 20,000 btu's is a tad more than 5000.

Thanks Kath (and Joe)
