Yes a bad fuel delivery system can cause this. Since you said you
don't have a fi pressure tester there is really no good way to
diagnose the problem unless you can eliminate the parts one by one by
testing them. All that aside, have you checked the Temp Sensor II?
This is the little thing-a-ma-bob that screws into the 3-4 cyl head
next to the intakes. If it is bad or loose it can cause that jerky
driving you describe. It's easy to check w/ just a VOM. Consult the
Bentley for actual resistance at different temps. Start there since
buying another one is only in the neighborhood of $20.
