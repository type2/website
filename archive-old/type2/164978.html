Subject: CamperJack Lives!

Well the '78 had its first trip around the neighborhood tonight, in the rain
no less.

I blew a CV joint almost immediately and spend a couple of hours cleaning,
packing and installing a better one. Used parts, sigh.

 

The good:

The '76 donor motor is running absolutely great. Thanks again to Chris at
BustedBus for his very hard work getting it together.

The heat is fantastic. Tells how much a stock heater works when it is put
together properly!

The ride is also great as is the steering. New suspension is always nice.

Brakes are great too.

 

The bad:

The third gear syncro is toast. I remember telling Chris &quot;hey this piece of
metal stuck to the drain plug magnet looks like it is from a syncro&quot;. I'm
kicking my own a** right now about that one.

It blows the main harness fuse when the lights are running and you turn on
either signal. Odd. I was wondering why the PO had a 25amp in the 8amp slot!
DANGEROUS!

Fuel gauge doesn't work, I'll fix that when the tranny comes out.

 

Again , thanks to you all for the advice and help. &quot;CamperJack&quot; lives!!!
