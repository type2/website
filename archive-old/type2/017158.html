Subject: Glue type for Light Lenses

What kind of glue do I want to use for repairing light lenses for
marker, signal, and brake lights?  Glue packages sometimes indicate what
kinds of plastic for which they are suitable for; but identifying these
lenses as plastic is as far as my knowledge of bonded polymers goes.
They are plastic, right?  :  )
