Subject: RE: [T2] Gas heater question

You have a BA6.  It has two heat settings, as you noticed.  Don't use the
higher one, just turn it on a tiny bit past the first click.  The timer is
used for when the engine isn't running, and isn't necessary when driving.

The switch that trips out, &quot;safety switch&quot;, trips out under a number of
circumstances that the bus isn't happy with.  It pops if the unit overheats.
It pops if the unit doesn't fire up after 30 or so seconds. There are a few
other things too.

You can download the manual for the heater here:

http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/eber/index.html

The manual explains the mysterious workings of the thing, and gives you a
number of diagnostic tests to run.  Check over the whole system.

My recommendation is to fix that exhaust pipe.  You may have to get some
generic exhaust tubes from the autostore and put something together, as I
expect you won't find a replacement.

After that, check to see if the recirculation fan is working fine.  The
exhaust burned out on mine for the PO, and melted the wiring harness the the
recirc fan.  So, my fan didn't work, and my unit overheated and pop.  It was
easy to fix.

Next, take the combustion air fan off, check it over to see if it has
problems, and while you are under there take the glow/spark plug out and
clean it up with a wire brush, and set the spark gap as per the manual.  A
dirty glow plug can cause the switch to pop too.  Also, clean up the
combustion chamber.  You don't want any sooty carbon deposits, so do your
best to get rid of that stuff.

You unit should be working fine, if not, the manual is your best resource
for checking the workings of each component until you determine which one is
a problem.

Start with the exhaust, its going to be an obvious problem, and it may
already have melted the wires the the recirculation fan under the back
seat -- which will cause the system to overheat.

I'm kindof curious why your overheat fuse doesn't blow.  Check to see if it
has the right fuse in it, sometimes people will &quot;fix&quot; an overheating problem
by putting in a higher amp fuse, which is dangerous.  You don't want the bus
to burn from your gas heater, so make sure no-one has overridden the safety
features of the BA6.

Volks: My 76 bus has the standard gas heater under the middle of the bus.
It works fine, but about every half hour or so it trips out, an I need to
reach up under the dash to the left of the steering column, and click the
little red
lever sticking out of the bottom of a little 2&quot;x2&quot;x2.5&quot; black box. It will
then run for about an other 1/2 hour
and trip out again, and so on. Any ideas what is wrong.

Note that the heater exhaust pipe has been rusting away, and now has some
holes near the
heater end if this makes any difference.

Other than that it works fine, although if you turn it up to max temp, it
will cook you out of the bus
pretty quick. The thing seems like way overkill for temperatures down to
about -25F. Maybe its
sized for the North?
