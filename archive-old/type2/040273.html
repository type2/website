Subject: Trying for a drier engine

Hi guys,
I am working through the various problems on my 76 Kombi purchased 2 months
ago. On the weekend I pressure washed the engine in preparation for
roadworthiness inspection on monday (surprise, it passed!) and afterwards I
saw oil dripping down the engine case just in front of the oil filter and
the oil filter itself was dripping. Thought it might have been the filter
seal and as it was due did an oil change and filter change.Couldnt see
anything untoward on the filter mount face.
Oil is still dripping. Is this likely to be the oil cooler seals? can they
be replaced without pulling the motor?
I have already done pushrod tube seals and fan hub seal.
thanks,
Jeff
