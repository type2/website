That may very from state to state. In NC pre 75 vehicles have a 
&quot;safety &quot; only inspection which the most dangerous of buses pass 
without much fanfare. They usually want to give you a sticker and get 
you off the lot. Most of the time they cannot find reverse and I have 
to back it out of the inspection bay for them.

Diesel fueled vehicles in NC of any year are exempt from emissions testing.
