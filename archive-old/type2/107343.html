Subject: Cold Start Valve

Last summer while returning from the USA to Canada customs decided to
search my van. I had shut off the engine to hear the customs officer
better and when I went to restart the engine it would not start. No
sound at all. I had to push it into the bay to be searched. I got it
running by running a wire directly from the starter and then touching it
to the battery. 

My 1977 FI van is a summer driver so it has been parked the majority of
the winter and every time I try to start it I have a very hard time and
usually have to plug it in for several hour before it fires up
beautifully (still under 100k original miles)

I thought the cold start valve was toast but after reading up a bit I
found that the cold start valve is activated by the key in the start
position. 

Since I am starting the van with a wire directly to the starter does
this mean that I am by-passing the cold start valve all together?

Next question is how to best sort out the starter issue. When I tried
relays even 40amp the all chatter. The van will start but it sounds
really bad as the starter engages and disengages. Is there a source for
higher voltage relays?


Thanks a lot,
