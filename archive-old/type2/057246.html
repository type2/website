Subject: Shift Rod alignment?

While under &quot;Janis&quot; our '71 Westy to tighten the clutch cable I noticed
the shift rod slam up against the side of the tube??... is this
something I should be concerned about? I've replaced all grommets and
bushings in the SR assembly and am concerned the trans. &amp; engine are a
bit out of line and could be trouble down the road.

Anyone's thoughts, opinions and insights are a asked for and appreciated
in advance.

May the &quot;Busma&quot; bless us all.......
