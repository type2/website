Subject: Rebuild From Heck --First Fire.  Finally.

Well, this message comes as a bit of anticlimax, I suppose.  &lt;:)  Oh, well.
 Deal.  ;)

At 6:00PM today, I resurrected the dead.  

And good *lord* is it a noisy zombie.  

After 14... no.  16! months.  I heard the howl of my baby's first cry.  

So did most of Connecticut, I'm sure.  

I'm not certain what I expected.  When I was trying to start it before
(with the cam timing off), it cranked and cranked, and cough-coughed a bit.
 This time, it cranked.. oh, 4 times. 

Maybe 5.  

6, tops. 

I really can't remember; after so many false alarms and no-fires, I was so
keyed up (ha!  get it?  keyed!  okay, fine, *don't* laugh) that I actually
don't remember the moment of turning the key and hearing it crank.  I just
remember the noise it made when it caught.  Oh, wow.  

Me widdle heart am go pitter pat.  

Excuse me for a moment.  [sniff]  

...

...

Okay, I'm back together, now.  :)

Yes, everything was peachy.  Need I add keen?  It was peachy, *and* keen.  

BUT.

The generator light was on.  And stayed on.  

[muttermutter]

I let the engine run until oil pressure was at 40psi, (a nice, quick,
steady climb... I'm so *proud*!) and then shut her off; I didn't want to
let the engine run with Red Light On. 

Whatever.  It ran.  8)  It made a big noise --hydraulic lifters un-pumped,
rings un-seated, un-broken in, and I did my best to build a very tight
engine, so it was a *big* noise-- and it made its poppa proud.  

The generator was spiffy when I pulled the engine initially; could it be
that I just have the wires to the voltage regulator crossed?  (In my first
engine-pull [*way* back when ;)], I disconnected the wires from the
regulator end, not from the generator.  They could be wrong.  How do I
know, I don't have any good way of referencing them.  :P)  

Bye, now.  I'm going to go take a bath.  I'll troubleshoot that red-light
tomorrow.  Today, I'm just going to enjoy the fruits of my labor.
