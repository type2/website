 I don't understand, isn't a 195 bigger than a 185?
 
 When I bought my bus it had 185/75-14 tires and when
 I checked my GPS against the speedometer it was off
 by 10mph.
 
 When travelling down I5 with the speedometer at
 70mph I was actually only going 60mph.
 
 I put on the 196/75-14 tires and my speedometer is
 now correct at 70mph when checked against my GPS
 (which means better gas mileage by the way!!)
 
 In order to travel faster at the same engine RPM the
 circumference of the tire must have increased,
 right?

Yes, a 195 is bigger than a 185 IF you do not consider

the middle aspect ratio number.

The 195 is the width of the tread in millimeters.

The aspect ratio number is the width of the sidewall
in a percent figure. 

The correct 185R14 tire has no middle aspect number.
Therefore it is a 82. 80% of 185mm is 5.8 inches with
a diameter of 25.7 inches.

The 195/75R14 is still 5.8 inches of sidewall but the
diameter is smaller: 25.5 inches. 

Go here: http://www.miata_dot_net/garage/tirecalc.html
and type in 185 80 14 on the left and 195 75 14 on the
right and you will see the difference.
