I'm thinking of a weekly Friday post something like the Weakly Statz, but
which is nothing but a clickable list of aircooled resources

 I know there are already indices on the web but the
thing is to push it into their mailboxes on a regular basis.

Push technology is bad, bad, demand technology is good, good--but as long
as we're living in pushland then let's frigging push useful stuff.

sounds like a great Idea.   There are a lot of themes that come up regularly
(or seasonally).  If a lot of this basic info is there to be read, people can
also get it sooner than waiting for someone(s) to answer.     

  But maybe for the brave and worthy soul who does want to put such a thing
together we can send a six pack , or a list baseball cap or something like
that as a carrot.

maybe I'll have a webpage someday, but I really am a computer idiot even I can
check my email.    I might have to upgrade my computer or something.
