Subject: Re: [T2] reman halfshafts and longevity

&gt; I used to use remanufactured halfshafts in my 1988 Golf.  They would last
&gt; about 40,000 miles (&quot;lifetime warranty&quot;).  Granted, I had some other play in
&gt; my front end that may have contributed to their demise.  When I finally
&gt; totaled the car it had 286,000 miles on it and running like a top.  thats a
&gt; lot of halfshafts.

but its front wheel drive right. those cvs take a lot more abuse and last
a lot less time
