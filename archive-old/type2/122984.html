Subject: RE: [T2] door wiring

Can these types of things be bought?  and what do you call them?  The
F**d house says that they come &quot;on&quot; the harness and I can't buy them
separately.
&lt;&lt;

how about using some fuel hose or something crafty like that? i guess the
challenge would be to make sure they stay in place during the entire range
of motion for the door.

good luck,
