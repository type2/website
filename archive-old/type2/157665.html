That depends upon the engine.  Stock engines run very well on 87 octane.
If he's installing a new Mexican engine it will run on just about
anything!

OTOH, if he is installing a modified high compression engine then you have
to run 91 or above to prevent detonation and the resulting high
temperatures.
