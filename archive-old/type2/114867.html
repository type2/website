Subject: RE: [T2] Location of aux battery

I am thinking that I might have to put the battery inside the bus. Maybe
under one of the seats? I have heard people talk about the gasses and
possible explosions, what is the lists opinions about that? The bugs all
have the battery under the seat and I see no problems with doing the same
thing. I personally have never seen a battery explode, but I am sure that
they could. Putting it under the bed would be perfect, easy to bolt down,
gain access to, connect to the isolator, etc.

&quot;I have my heater (BA-4) under the bus, 2nd battery in engine compartment
