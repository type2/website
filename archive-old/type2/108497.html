Subject: Just bought my first T2b !

Hi all,

I'm so happy, today I bought my first (and final?) T2 Westfalia camper.
It's a '79, in near-perfect no-rust-at-all condition, first color
(white/beige) and
an all original interiour. It looks great. Smells great ! Drivers great !
Sounds great ! Everything great !
It's an original Dutch camper (I'm from Holland) And I will soon put it
online.

Thanks all for the tips regarding the rear seatbelts.

See you soon !

Oscar
Holland
