On 11/16/98 1:50 PM, CHEVIERS_at_REU.RELTECCORP.COM thus spake:

&gt;Does anyone know what the first year was that VW decided to include
&gt;A/C in their buses.  I would imagine it was on a Water cooled model.
&gt;I am scheming up a plan to build my dream bus and I am looking into
&gt;the AC option.

     Stock, probably around '79-80, with the Vanagons. The breadloaves 
(68-79) had a dealer installed A/C as an option, but not a factory job. 
Maybe around 77 or so, since they got all slick with modern stuff then, 
but I expect it's in the Vanagon era before they really became normal-all 
the breadloaf ones I've seen are the dealer addons, either overhead or 
under the dash.


Peace,
