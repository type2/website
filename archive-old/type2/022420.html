Subject: Erratic loss of power- need advice
Mime-Version: 1.0

Volks,
	Here's the situation:
'72 Bus with 1700 engine. Many years ago the dual carb setup was pitched 
for the dual barrel progressive, but it's not a Webber- it's a Brosol 
(apparently a cheap imitation of the Webber that parts are NLA for). The 
bus had sat for eight years in a garage and the owners asked me to get it 
running again.
	After a tune up and some maintence, she runs, but twice now I've taken her 
out for a drive around the block, and both times after about 5 minutes of 
driving, there is a TOTAL loss of power. She will idle, and sometimes rev 
up high, but once I let the clutch out and try to go anywhere, the engine 
dies and I have to press in the clutch to keep the engine from totally 
stopping.
	The first time I was right outside of the owner's driveway and managed to 
limp the bus into the driveway and back to the garage, but today I was out 
with the owner and we were two blocks away from the house. I thought maybe 
it was a torn diaphragm in the fuel pump that would expand once the engine 
got warm enough and not pump enough fuel to the carb. So I let the bus 
idle, hoping that the float bowl would fill up and we would have enough gas 
to get us back to the house. It didn't work. Still no power. So I turned 
the bus off for a while, hoping that the pump would cool down and start 
pumping again. That didn't work either. I decided to give it one last 
chance before we walked back to the house and used my bus to tow this bus 
home. Again, she would idle, but had NO power once I stepped on the gas. 
Out of frustration, I stepped on the gas and held it down. All of sudden, 
the RPMs shot up, but then back down again. So I tried it again, and this 
time the bus went about half a block, stuttering, barely making it up the 
hill (sort of like if I had the bus in 4th at 5mph) and then all of a 
sudden, there was a sputter and the engine roared to life! We drove the 
next block and a half just fine!  What the heck is going on here?
	Here's what I am thinking:
	Dirty gas tank or dirty carb.
I pulled the carb out of the bus last week and unfortunately was only able 
to clean it with carb spray where ever I could get the little straw- no one 
sells rebuild kits for these carbs anymore, so I was afraid to take it 
apart for fear that I would ruin the gaskets. (I've also been advised to 
just chuck the carb and get a webber, but the owners are on a budget...)
Anyway, let me know what you volks think. I really don't want to have to 
pull the gas tank if I don't have to, nor do I want to charge the owners 
the $200 or so dollars for a new carb if that's not the problem. AHHHHHH!!!
Thanks,
Joel
