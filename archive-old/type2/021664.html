Subject: Re: [T2] URGENT SOS

Chris:
You are right, this is  a normal job for most mechanics these days, changing a
CV.
I really doubt the axle is shot, just the CV.
This is really a case where a little preventative mainenance would have gone a
long ways. These damn CV's will almost last forever if they have boots and
grease.
I bought 4 new ones in 1986 for my 78 bus, put 2 on. Stopped driving the 78 due
to rust. I've put a total of 250,000 miles on 4 subsequent Vanagons and have
only had occasion to use one more of my original 1986 spares! Oh, I've put a
lot of grease and boots on, but often long after I should have.
BTW, it's a major PAIN to get to the outer bolts on a Vanagon without a lift
and an air wrench, so this is definitely a job to tackle before leaving home!

&gt;
&gt; A good pair of vise grips to force the bolts off if the socket head wrench
&gt; won't do it's job.
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; Do we know if the axle is literally sheared or one of the CV joints has
&gt; exploded?
&gt;
&gt; If he doesn't want to do the work himself - ANY - mechanic can do this job.
&gt;
&gt; Will require tow job to local gas station and possibly a little guidance.
&gt;
&gt; Wish I could help more but I am 9 hours away...
