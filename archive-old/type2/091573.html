Bad pilot bearings show up (usually) when the clutch does not disengage
despite pressing the pedal with normal-feeling tension (no broken cable,
etc.  The pilot shaft is essentially stuck to the crank.

Bad throwout bearing makes noise anytime you press on the clutch pedal,
even if clutch is still engaged.

Engine has to come out to replace either.
