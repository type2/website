Subject: Share your original paperwork...

I posted mine on TheSamba, but was curious: How many of you still have
original paperwork, manuals, etc for your busses?

I have the original delivery invoice showing shipping from the factory to
Frankfurt and original paint codes, options, etc.

I also have the original owner's manual and warranty certificate. =D
