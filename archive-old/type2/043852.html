Subject: [T2] 1970 Bus paint

OK,
All you fellows out there with 1970 Westy campers in the white color.
Was there more than one white ??

What &quot;generic&quot; white off of the shelf paint (either bottle with little 
dabber, or spray)  have you found and used successfully to cover up 
dings and chips?

If there is more than one white involved here, I guess I will need to 
give you more info as to what white I think my buses have.
