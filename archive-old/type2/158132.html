Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Fire Survial

Hello,  Never actually seen the heat shield between the muffler and the body 
(flat piece of metal that goes between the muffler and body).  Mine must have 
disappeared yrs ago.  Could anyone direct me to a parts break down on some 
site or send me a picture. Any help would be appresiated. Thanks. Dino.

Hey guys  Sounds like the heat shield is also missing .    Famous Vw  words  
Rust gets them slow  Fire gets them quick   Always carry a fire extinguisher  
in fact two is even better .  Had a 75 westy burn to the ground when it threw 
a rod and it cut the fuel line at the 5th injector  ??  Who would have thought 
such a thing could happen ?   later  Mark Dearing
