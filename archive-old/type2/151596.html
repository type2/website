Jack,

My local FLAPS sends them off to a company in California called something
like Python Remanufacturing.  As for ACVW's, they tell me for my '79, I
can get a rebuilt air flow meter for $103 and it wouldn't be worth the
money to have one rebuilt. That is the exchange price. He did stress
that if the core they receive back has been tampered with or opened,
they will refuse it. He told me they have gotten burned too many times
when they send off a core back to Python from a cash paying customer,
and Python refuses the core. But anyhow, $103 doesn't seem to me to
be a bad price for a rebuilt air flow meter.
