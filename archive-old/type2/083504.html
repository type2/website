&gt; &gt;I plan to install a flashing third brake light.
&gt; &gt;I've come to realize that most people are now almost
&gt; &gt;totally dependant on seeing that third light to
&gt; &gt;recognize that you're braking. I figure that
&gt; &gt;if I make it flash, its more likely to get their
&gt; &gt;attention.

&gt; In the 70's studies were done and just such devises were offered. From
&gt; memory, I recall the frequency of best utility to capture attention was 5
&gt; to 7 flashes per second. I installed such a devise on my BMW R90S.

It seems a lot of these devices ended up on BMW motorcycles!  I have one
on my R100RT!

&gt; I have
&gt; no idea if such modulators are still available. Truly, this is a very good
&gt; safety item. You get a whole higher order of magnitude better response from
&gt; followers. Indeed, better recognition stats were obtain for daylight tests
&gt; as opposed for night time.

I think that the stock 3rd brake light killed the industry.  I
occasionally had trouble because law enforcement didn't know that such
lights were legal.  I started carrying around a xerox of the vehicle code
section.
