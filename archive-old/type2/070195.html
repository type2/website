Subject: Compression Test

Hoping to get some recommendations on the type of

compresson tester to buy.

Cylinders 1 and 3 are a bugger to get to in my

74 bus, so I was thinking longgggg hose would

be nice.  Sears has one 29.00, short hose,

screws in, not sure I can screw it in the holes

with the engin tin in the way.

Any thoughts?

Thanks much!!
