Subject: Re: [T2] doing push rod tube seals this weekend

Richard
After you pull the old seals and tubes, use some x-fine sandpaper to lightly 
remove any burrs or shelac buildup where the seals meet the aluminum.  Make 
sure that the tubes are round and check the tube rims for any irregularities 
in the groove where the seal sits. When replacing the tubes, be certain that 
they go in evenly and straight ( I use a socket and extension to make sure 
the pressure is even all the way around, tapping in witha hammer) You will 
feel it &quot;seat&quot; on the last tap.  Use any kind lubricant to ease them in.
