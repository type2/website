Subject: [T2] Fuel smell and replacing rubber filler neck

You noted these Symptoms:
&quot;Fuel smell in bus when turning sharp left. Stopped immediately and found
gas on the inside of the gas cap, but not leaking outside.

I would like more information about level of fuel in the tank when this 
test was performed.

If it was on a full tank, I would want to know what the results would be on 
a half-full tank.

Perhaps you only get his result on a full tank, and at some other fill 
level the problem may not exist.

The defect in the elbow may still exist, but an alternative solution to the 
problem would be  available until the elbow was corrected.

If it were mine, I would siphon off fuel from the tank and reduce the level 
to less than half a tank.
Then I would perform the same maneuver (sharp left) and compare results 
with the full-tank condition.

That also MIGHT give me some hints as to the level of the defect (if any) 
in the filler pipe.
