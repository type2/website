Subject: [T2] Total advance timing question

Hi,
I have a 78 westy and was wondering if there was a total advance timing
adjustment equivalent to 7.5 degs BTDC at 900 rpm. I have no tachometer so
nailing the idle ajustment is tough. If there is a maximum advance that
yields the same result it would be much easier. Type 1 engines use 28-32
total as a rule don't they. I have seen many references to this but none for
type4 engines.
Bob
