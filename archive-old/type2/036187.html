Subject: Re: Why not jar cylinders loose?

Sometimes the cylinders will stick more to a head than to the case and come
loose anyway when the head is pulled. To avoid this, you can hold a cylinder
in place by clamping a vice-grip on a stud, between two cylinder cooling
fins.

&gt; Once the cylinders are pulled away from the case, they will leak oil at the
&gt; case. The seal that the paper gasket and/or shelac had will be broken and
&gt; they will leak. At least that's the idea.
&gt; 
&gt; I have seen them leak mildly from this...and I've seen them leak profusely
&gt; from this.

&gt; Good luck! Joe

&gt;&gt; Muir sez that when you're doing a valve job &quot;under no conditions, jar the

&gt;&gt; they not just be returned to their position?
