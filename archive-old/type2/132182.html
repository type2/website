Subject: Re: [T2] fuel line hoses

&gt; To be honest, they look better than any fuel line I have seen in recent years.
&gt; They are rubber with a cloth covering. There are no cracks or bulges anywhere
&gt; at the ends or in the runs of the line.

They don't crack on the outside: they crack radially at all the connections.
If it were obvious fewer buses would mysteriously burn down at the most
inappropriate times.

&gt; They may have been replaced by a PO, but I have generally found things to be
&gt; factory on this bus.

You just made your decision right there: may have been replaced.

Even if you suspect the PO or his mechanic may have changed the hoses, don't
put 100% trust in their abilities.

Changing fuel lines is not an arduous task and risking the investment in
your bus over $10-15 of hose is very foolish. Get a fuel line clamp and
drain the tank, transfer the gas to another vehicle if you can and change
the fuel filter while you have access.

See my article for the fuel line lengths that you'll need to cut to:
