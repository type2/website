Subject: Re: [T2] Intake Air Dist - Fat Hose Rpl Help

They're not too hard to replace.  Remove the injectors, remove the 4 bolts
that hold the air distributors to the heads, and pull them off.  The hoses
then slide off the air distribution box, if they didn't come off with the
air distributors themselves.

Many people nip air leaks in the bud on these things by using hose clamps on
them at both ends; 8 clamps will do the engine.

Before replacing them, however, you should try to determine if they're
really leaking.  The easiest way, in my opinion, to search for leaks is to
pressurize the system and then spray/squab soapy water everywhere leaks
might occur.

Subject: [T2] Intake Air Dist - Fat Hose Rpl Help


&gt; For a 2.0L FI engine, is there an easy way to replace those four short fat
&gt; intake air dist to manifold tube hoses without first removing the intake
air
&gt; dist?  I've got a massive vacuum leak (only pulling 5 in HG) in my 79 bus
&gt; that I'm troubleshooting and I'm getting to the point where I may need to
&gt; replace those four hoses.
&gt;
&gt; I've disconnected the decel valve, brake booster hose with no change.
Next
&gt; step is to disconnect everything (dist, fuel pressure reg, decel valve,
&gt; brake booster, air box, aux air valve) to see in vacuum goes up.
