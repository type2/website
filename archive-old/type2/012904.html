I seem to have consistent bad luck with the clutch master cylinders 
leaking on my 83 Westfalia.

They always work right for about a year and when we have our first cold
snap they start to leak.

I have been replacing the units with new $68.00 units each year.

Is there a particular brand name cylinder or particular type of brake
fluid I should be using?

They appear to be leaking out the top where the plunger goes in.

I'm open to any assistance from van owners or vendors on this problem.

I'm getting pretty tired of draging the carpet out to clean it and that
big spot of brakefluid on the driveway each morning is putting me into a
slow burn.
