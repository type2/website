I dunno Al,, I have never seen a GFI in a campsite,, then again, I have never
seen a million dollars and I know it exists,, 

I wrote a GFI topic reply a while ago,, it is in the archives, Basically my
suggestion was to buy a short GFI cord that you can carry with you, and have
when ever you plug in,, even if your mooching at some listee's house and end up
plugging into the barn.


here is some of what I wrote,, the rest is at

My safety sermon about GFCi's [GFi's] 
I have seen too many campsites that have the receptacles wired backwards,, or
the camper is wired incorrectly,, and it ends up giving the people a &quot;tingle&quot;
One case I measured 120 volts from the door of the camper to the ground ... or
in other words, from the little girls hand to her feet,, follow that path, it
passes through her heart!
I unplugged the camper, looked where the owner had &quot;repaired&quot; the cord, and
found the wires connected reversed polarity, and the ground wire not connected.

Please... Please, if you ever feel a tingle, unplug the camper right away, and
find out how to solve the problem without hurting yourself

I Carry a simple device with me, 
http://www.testersandmeters_dot_com/IDEAL-ez/products.nsf/ItemMasterLookup/p61-035?OpenDocument
always plugged into the receptacle, that has 3
small neon lights, It will tell me if I have any faults. the faults are
described on the side of the unit.
 In fact, simply,It tells me if I have power. 
The first thing I check when I plug in is the &quot;tester&quot;,,, Yup! Got power, then I
flip the fridge to AC.... 

If you want to go one step further, buy a GFi cord, It is a very short cord that
you plug into the power post, then plug your extension cord into that.
If a fault ever develops, it will trip, saving you!

I think I will heed my own wisdom. And buy a GFi cord.
It is a requirement of construction workers in Ontario to use a gfi protected
outlet,, here is an example of a portable one you can carry in the Camper..
available at most Home Depot type stores etc
