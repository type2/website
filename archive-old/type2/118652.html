Subject: Re: [T2] Quick Kadron question

&gt; If I remember correctly, It is just a fuel rated rubber hose between
 the balance ports on the intake manifolds....at least that was all it was
 when I last installed on a bug engine....

  Red tube in the picture below should be the balance tube

Strange with no fan shroud in that pic!  How does he keep the battery charged to run that fan on top? No gen
or alt in the pic......

I run the Kadrons on my 67 bus. I have a rubber hose that attaches to a big nipple pointing to the front off
each intake [single port, tall Kadron intakes]. The hose then goes around the front of the shroud [front is
front!] and is out of sight completely.
