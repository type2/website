Subject: One conundrum from this trip (actually a few, but probably
  related...)

It will probably be a while before I get to give GWB a thorough
after-trip going over. But two issues arose during the trip and if
someone could make sure I'm heading down the correct path, I'd be much
obliged.

I think they're all the same issue, and a valve being too tight is the problem.

#1:
Doesn't just start anymore like it used to. I have to floor the pedal
while cranking. I verified it's not another vacuum leak with copious
amounts of carb cleaner. It does start eventually however.

#2: 
Seems to take forever to rev up when in neutral or when the clutch
pedal is down. Non-issue on the highway, but a deal killer on surface
streets. To get it to rev up I have to floor it.

#3: 
Also still won't idle consistently. It seems to decide on its own
whether it will idle or not. Needs lots of pedal to say alive.

I really think my valves are whacked. I did abuse this bus with this
trip, after all... And being in a hotel sucks, because I'm sure the
management won't appreciate me crawling around under my bus getting
all greasy in their parking lot. ;-)

Anyway, if I'm heading down the wrong path, please let me know!
