&gt;Hey, Bob,
&gt;     I love the idea you came up with for curtians for your bus.  I have a
&gt;1970 bus, and i am getting ready to make curtains.  I would love to see some
&gt;pictures of your set up.  Thanks a lot, I think i am going to do the same
&gt;thing that you did!
==========================&gt;
The weather has been cold here (by our standards),
and really strong North winds hitting us lately.

Will drag the curtains out for some pictures later this week if things get 
back to being more proper.
