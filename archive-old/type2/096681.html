Subject: torque pattern for heads

A 1600cc  DP engine;  components from Berg:

For years, when I tighten head nuts,  I've been following the two 
step process shown in my ancient copy of Muir.  Torque to a certain 
value in pattern #1; then torque to the final value in pattern  #2.

The sheet that comes with Berg heads shows only one pattern  - 
identical to Muir #2.  Berg has you tighten in several steps, but 
using only this pattern.

Can anyone comment on which is the preferred way to do heads?

Thanks, jack
