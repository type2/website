Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Temps.



&gt; Further to the recent posts regarding oil temps, the original sticker in
the
&gt; engine bay of my '77 bus (2.0L) states oil temp. to be between 50 and
70deg
&gt; C (~150-180F). In my experience this is unachievable!! Even the beetle
(1500
&gt; type 1) which runs much cooler than my bus the oil runs around 75C
(~190F).
&gt; They must have extra good air for cooling in Germany.

That sticker is not telling you your normal operating temp.  It is telling
you the temp range you can make engine adjustments in.  Note that is the
sticker with the idle speed, CO%, etc.  It's saying that in order for you to
make adjustments to these things, the oil temp needs to be in that range.
