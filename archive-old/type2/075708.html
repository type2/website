Subject: Re: [T2] warmish startup prob.

In my 71 Westy, I had installed a progressive Pinto carb and ran a
push-pull cable along the driver side wall and down into the engine
compartment under the spare tire well.  Pull dechoked it; push it turned
the choke valve.  No problem starting it.

&gt; &gt; For winter starts--down to single digits-- I pump the pedal once and
&gt; &gt; it starts on first crank. Ahhhh.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But when it is really cold and I only drive 10 minutes or so (2-5
&gt; &gt; miles, the VDO temp gauge just starts to register). i have a hard time
&gt; &gt; restarting for the next few hours. Usually if I hold the pedal all the
&gt; &gt; way down while cranking 5 to 15 times, it starts and runs fine.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But sometimes when it is in some limbo, half-warmed up state after an
&gt; &gt; hour in the cold, it takes several long-g-g-g sessions of cranking
&gt; &gt; with the pedal held down before it fires up (obviously flooded--gas
&gt; &gt; odor). Xmas eve it took me 20 minutes of cranking and letting it sit
&gt; &gt; before it came back to life.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Is this diagnostic of a easily fixable choke problem?
&gt; 
&gt; Glen,
&gt; 
&gt; It has been 10 years since I have run a carb regularly, but what you
&gt; describe sounds like normal operating behaviour to me. Note that I did not
&gt; say pleasant operating behavior, just normal.
&gt; 
&gt; The way the automatic choke works is that it is a bimetalic spring in a
&gt; housing next to an electric heating element.  First thing in the AM, the
&gt; spring and carb body are the same temp as the outside air.  If it is warm,
&gt; the spring is unwound and the choke is open, if it is cold, the spring
&gt; winds up tight and the choke is closed.  When you get in and give the gas
&gt; that single slow pump, you (a) set the choke and (b) give it a shot of gas
&gt; from the accelerator pump.  Then you turn the key and (if everything else
&gt; is set up correctly) it starts.  In addition, you start feeding some
&gt; electricity to the heating element.  As that element heats the bimetal
&gt; spring, it uncoils and opens the choke.  After a minute or so, the choke
&gt; element is hot, the choke butterfly is open and the car is ready to go.
&gt; 
&gt; This is fine *if* you then run the car for 20 minutes or so and get the
&gt; engine all nice and thoroughly warmed up.  If you only go for 5 minutes,
&gt; tho,  and turn it off.... well, the element is hot, the choke is open, BUT
&gt; the engine is still cold and needs some choke!  By opening the throttle,
&gt; and pumping a bit, and then feathering the throttle you can get the engine
&gt; to restart, but it is a PITA.  It is however a normal PITA and just the
&gt; way that system works.
&gt; 
&gt; There are other down-sides to 5-minute drives as well.... mufflers rust
&gt; faster and you get mayonaise in the oil.  Basically, cold weather means
&gt; start it 10 minutes before you need it and let it sit and warm or plan on
&gt; round-about drives to the store :-)
