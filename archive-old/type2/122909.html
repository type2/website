Subject: RE: [T2] selenoid replacement - relay installation

Selenoid replacement is uncertain since I will basically need the original 
to find out whats in the van.

I have decided to stick a relay in for the system as well. I see that the 
part listed in the
Relay instruction in the library are for a Bosch WR-1 which I couldn't find 
locally.
Instead I was able to get a Bosch SBQ5 unit which should do the trick (I 
think).

Its a relay that can be used also for headlights and such.

Any help from those that have done this before?
