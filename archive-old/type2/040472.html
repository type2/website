&gt; I have 1977 Van.  Runs great and all work done by Doktor Tim on San Juan

&gt;  anyone have idea of price?  

Marilyn, it depends a lot on what kind of van it is, what body work needed, 
etc.  

When we got Lily (Who, by chance, is also a '77), we paid  $1900, and that 
involved talking the owners down.  *I* think we got a steal, as she's a Westy 
Deluxe and had *all* the goodies with her, down to the &quot;factory&quot; trailer 
hitch (it came with the car new according to the papers with it - yes, we had 
all the papers, too!) and hammock and both tables and the parts 
box/footstool.  No rust.  Good, shiny paint (Green, as befits a lilypad and 
home for wayward frog stuffies).  I've seen similar cars go for up to $3400, 
and as little as $500.  Again, it depends on a lot.  Anoher factor is where 
you live - here in Northern California, car prices are high high high.  Back 
in Arkansas where my brother is, they're low, low, low.  Where he's at, you 
would be hard pressed to have gotten $1900 for Lily (there was her twin, in 
orange, almost as nice, for $500 there), only because cars (and the cost of 
living) is less back there, along with the wage structure.

I know, I got really long winded, but you see, there's a lot of factors in 
pricing your car.  I mean, yeah, it's not hard to figure out, but you have to 
take a lot into consideration.
