&gt; Hello Everyone,
&gt;
&gt; I have a quick question. My 72 bus needs a valve adjustment and the timing
&gt; corrected. My local VW guy quoted me $250 for a tune-up and complete
&gt; check-up.

I do the valve adjustment and timing in an hour on a slow day.  Whether
$250 is worth it depends upon what a &quot;complete check-up&quot; entails.
