I picked one of these up a few years before I got our bus, at just $25.00 to
tow it away.  I'd always wanted one, thought they looked cool.

The PO had put a '74 engine in a '76, couldn't figure out the wiring harness
(hmm... maybe the alternator doesn't go to ground like that...)

A couple of Chilton photocopies from the local library of the wiring, a bit
of creative wiring, and I had a car that lasted like 5 or 6 years.  At
something like $200.00 to $300.00 a year for up-keep, it was a real deal.

There are 5 or 6 of the things here in town, almost all lovingly restored by
their owners.

However, nothing even comes close to the uniqueness and keenness of owning
my bus. :O)
