Hi Guys,
Just got a new bus, a 76 8 seater to relace my previous 76 which has too
many rust and other issues for me to tackle
It's a 2 litre with twin solexes (the early 76's came stock this way in
Australia)
Idles fine, pulls fine off idle on light or full throttle, but on part
throttle gets to a certain speed and bogs down, which need lots of throttle
to get past.Runs fine on the highway and up hill.
Receipts I got with it show a carby rebuild including shaft bushing about 6
months ago and compression test ,plugs, points,leads and dissy cap a month
ago.
I checked for plenty of fuel flow fom the tank, a new filter, proper vaccuum
distributor and correct timing.
Any suggestions?
jeff
