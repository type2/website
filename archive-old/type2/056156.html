I'm likely to be taking a trip to San Francisco later this summer; and
it has occurred to me that I might take advantage of the airline baggage
allowance to save some shipping costs on a dual port type 1 engine for
my '71 bus.  Several issues arise, however.  Since the weight limit is
70 lbs., I am hoping that a short-block weighs in at less than this.
Can anyone confirm or confute this?  If the weight proves not to be a
problem, the next question is where to buy it.  One possibility is to
make the drive out to Sacramento and pay a visit to AVP.  Any other
suggestions on reputable Bay area rebuilders?  I might be amenable to
getting one of the VW of Mexico longblocks, though this would obviously
require partial disassembly for the flight home.
