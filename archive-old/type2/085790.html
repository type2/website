Subject: Re: re[2]: [T2] Tuning AFM with Oxygen sensor

Mark,

You are on the right track in looking at the mix over the operating range.  
Why the preset air/fuel map in your air mass sensor isn't correct isn't 
clear. Maybe the PO fooled with it.

As to the meter, I have read that 1,000,000 (1 Meg ohm)ohms/volt or more is 
recommended in order to get near the ideal 0.45 volt = 14.7: air/fuel ratio 
(stoichemetric). The effect of any meter is that (in addition to a voltage 
error) a loading effect error is introduced causing the reading to be lower 
than ideal. Your digital meter may be OK but it makes it harder to compare 
your readings to those of others if digital meter sampling rates, times, and 
impedances differ. Because the voltage is very noisy (jumps around in 
amplitude) a low pass filter ahead of a high impedance meter gives an 
average steady reading. If your reading is steady it is because the ox 
sensor isn't working or the sampling rate and time of your meter is 
fortuitously filtering out the noise.

It pays to be a little careful here because it is harmful to the engine to 
run too lean.

The &quot;ideal 14.7:1 ratio or 0.450 volts&quot; is NOT ideal for air cooled VWs. I 
try for no greater than 13:1 idle or cruise. Sorry but your guess as to what 
13:1 equals on your set up is as good as mine. I would set it at 0.625 volts 
and look at the plugs and exhaust color. Better rich than lean.

Others on the list might be of more specific help.


Good luck

Chuck Watson

&gt;
&gt;  &gt;&gt;  1. Have you established the correlation between voltage and fuel-air?
&gt;Yes. When I tighten the spring, the mixture gets leaner and the voltage 
&gt;goes down and vice-versa.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;2. Do you have a High Impedance meter?
&gt;
&gt;I should know the meaning of impedance (Dad's an engineer), but.. this is a 
&gt;small digital radio-shack meter. I do think the meter is working correctly 
&gt;since it seems to be giving me values of the expected range -- 0 volt to 
&gt;950 millivolt.
&gt;
&gt;  &gt;&gt;  3. Can you really adjust the &quot;spring&quot; in the air sensor under cruise 
&gt;(I
&gt;  &gt;&gt;  assume the bus would be under load and moving) conditions. I drove 
&gt;around
&gt;  &gt;&gt;  with the air sensor lid off once and the pot wiper was very very busy 
&gt;as was
&gt;  &gt;&gt;  the spring.
&gt;
&gt;What I was doing was stopping the bus, adjusting the spring, then driving 
&gt;again. I was not actually moving the spring position while in motion. That 
&gt;would take two people and seems a little dangerous for the one in the back 
&gt;;-)
