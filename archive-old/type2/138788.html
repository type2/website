Subject: Re: [T2] Heater pipe replacement

&gt; The large paper pipe can easily enough be replaced by aluminum HVAC
&gt; duct that can be had at the Home Depot, wrapped with some decent
&gt; insulation (anyone have suggestions for material that would hold up
&gt; best on the underside of a Bus?)

On my 75 I replaced the pipe with double wall galvanized vent pipe for a hot 
water heater vent. I filled the void between the inner and outer tubes with 
low expension spray foam insulation. Worked great! Weighs more than the 
paper/foil tube so I made extra hangars to hold it under the bus.
&gt;
&gt; The accordion tubes should probably be removed and cleaned.  Are these
&gt; fairly easy to remove from underneath?  Suggestions on a cleaner that
&gt; can remove the goo without damaging the plastic?  Since they're
&gt; corrugated, most of the cleaning action is going to have to come from a
&gt; long soak and a thorough rinsing, I think.
&gt;
1.Loosen 2 hose clamps per tube.
2.Twist to break years of goo sealing tube to pipe.
3. Pull tubes off pipes (If they wont come off cuss twice, and go back to 
step 2.
4. Soak in a solution of Castrol Super Clean And water overnight. 
Periodicaly agitate the tubes in the liquid.
5. Use an adjustable spray nozzle on a garden hose, Spray out the inside of 
the tubes with as forceful of a stream of water as you can without dammaging 
the insulation inside the tube. If it is not now clean, go back to step4.
