Subject: Need Tools...

Hey Volks...
        Where can I get the 12-splined Allen wrench-type tool for
removing/tightening the 
nuts that hold the clutch to the flywheel? (For that matter, where do I get
replacements
for the nuts I stripped out using a 6-splined tool?...) I called the local
VW place and
*natch* they didn't have 'em...Neither did they have the large gasket that
goes all 'round 
the engine compartment---what is that called? I call it an engine
gasket...is that the proper
name?
         I'm an hour north of Atlanta and would appreciate info/moral
support/war stories
&gt;from local listees...

                           '73 Engine Donor (not a Westy...)
