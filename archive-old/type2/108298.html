Subject: Philbin

A few months ago I ordered a rebuilt dizzy from the Philbin Group to enhance
my new rebuilt engine. It arrived soon after, received a cursory loook-see
from me, then waited in my garage for a number of weeks before I went to
install it. I then noticed a couple of defects. I put my old dizzy back in
play, and called Philbin. They said to return the rebuild, so I did. They
sent it back to me in a few days all fixed up :0) I'm sure I was well
outside their normal statute of limitations on returns, but no questions or
hassles. Sometimes the best measure of business (or person) is how they
react when things go wrong...
