Subject: Re: [T2] star adjusters..

Can your turn the drums freely?  If you're trying to adjust your rear
brakes, it means that your shoes are loose, need to be tightened, and
are therefore not rubbing against the drums.  If that's the case, then
you should be able to take the drum off.  On my 78 westy I sprayed some
wd-40 right in the center of the drum area where the drum meets the
wheel hub.  It seems like that's a spot where it likes to get stuck
because it's a tight fit.  Then a few taps with the mallet and it's off.

In addition to anti-seize for the star nuts, get yourself a couple cans
of brake cleaner and spray those suckers out.

Also, you don't have the hand-brake on, do you?  That'll always mess ya
up if you're trying to pull off the drum ;)

&gt; Can't get 'em loose!  any suggestions?  Is it OK to spray PB Blaster in there or will I soak the shoes?  Of course I'm hoping to get them out anyway.  Should the drums slide off without loosening the stars?  They don't- the stars are my only hope.
&gt; Please Help!  -Chris  73 Westy
