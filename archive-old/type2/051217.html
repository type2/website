Hi Ron
I did not mean this as an attack towards you.  I was, shall we say,
&quot;discouraged&quot; at the longevity of the part.  Yes, you get what you pay for
in the end.  The Timkens and seals were slightly more expensive _at_ FLAPS, but
if you pony up for your shipping costs....  I am, for the most part, pleased
with the products and service I have received from you.  However, Caveat
Emptor applies in all business dealings.

Lifetime warranties are not worth the paper they're printed on, in the end
just words on a page, or a screen.  Just like posts to the lists.

Forward this if you want, in it's entirety of course.  Again, I did not
intend an attack on you or your products.  I look forward to continued trade
with Bus Depot.

Mad Uncle Dave
