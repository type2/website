Hi volks,

Just wanted to let the folks who are coming to the Lowcountry Bus Festival
June 25-27 in Round O,SC.  That the directions are now posted on the web page.

http://www.geocities_dot_com/Baja/Ravine/2474/index.html
and click camp-outs.  Click on directions next to countdown gadget.
Hope some list members can make it.  The area is real shady with access to a
huge field for playing.  We are planning  a short trip Saturday to the Edisto
river for anyone interested.  If any one needs any more info please email me.

Peace

Snoopy
