&gt;After ten years without a vacation, a soon to be wed daughter gives an

&gt;
&gt;At the end of June, Lisa and I are heading from Union, Oregon to 
&gt;Diamond, Ohio to give away the bride on July 3. The journey will take us 
&gt;through: Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, Nebraska, Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, and 
&gt;most all of Ohio. With any luck we'll try to continue on through 
&gt;Pennsylvania and Maryland to DC so I can at last see the Smithsonian. 
&gt;(I've been east exactly once. In 1978. Broke down in Roxboro, NC. Didn't 
&gt;make the Smithsonian.... Did make an acquaintance that I still talk 
&gt;about though.)
&gt;
&gt;We've gathered the complete AIRS listings of the aforementioned states 
&gt;but really hope to only make social calls.
&gt;
&gt;We'll be driving the Orphan, an '82 Diesel Westy, thoughtfully provided 
&gt;by Britt Grannis.
&gt;
&gt;So... If you see a white V'gon Westy in your part of the world, please 
&gt;flag us down.
