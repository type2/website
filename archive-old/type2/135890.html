&lt;&lt; Can't wait to buy Craftsmen tools at Kmart prices. :)

Not gonna happen...There are a few of us oldies who remember
when Craftsman tools actually were for mechanics (in the med-
ieval guild sense... ;-) 
Most of the big retailers are following the leader, Wal-Mart...
A rapid race down the cheap labor path...
What you're probably gonna find is K-Mart quality at Sears
prices...

Best line I've heard about Harbor Freight, BTW...&quot;I don't care
who Harbor Freight sources from...By the time I found out,
they'd have found a cheaper supplier...&quot;
