Hi,

One of my 1970 Westies has a parcel tray under the dash. It is two piece and
made of metal, not bamboo. It has a rubber welting around the frame to which
a fabric net is attached which forms the actual shelf. It looks factory, I
dont know if it is. I plan on moving it to the running bus now that you
reminded me of it. Come to think of it, The two 1970's also differ on the
inside electrical outlet. The one with the parcel tray has it on the side
wall of the bus. The other has the outlet on the jump seat. Could one be an
early 70 and the other a late? 

Reagrds,

Jeff

Subject: [T2] Parcel Tray Wanted

Hello,
    I own a 1977 Westfalia and have been looking for a
bamboo parcel tray for under the dash.  I was offered
one for $25 bucks, but I didn't e-mail the guy back
fast enough.  I have also seen a repro that is not
bamboo and it's a little too expensive.  Then I got an
e-mail saying that they don't even exist.  Does anyone
know of any for sale or any information about them? 
Thanks a lot.  I really appreciate the help.

Peace,
Tim
