This fitting was provided in the deluxe vans only (as far as I know).  In the 
&quot;properly&quot; outfitted camper, the back seat vents would be blocked off by the 
icebox/sink on one side and the &quot;sitzback&quot; seat on the other.  I have both 
fittings for the door duct from a nose piece I bought to restore my '71 
Westy.  Want 'em?
