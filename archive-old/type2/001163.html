Subject: Wiring Meltdown

Help
You will recall from my post earlier in the week, I wanted to get my horn
working.  I was troubled by the wiring and mentioned the fact that I was
gently yanking, not good, remember?  Well HapyBus melted  a few wires today.
Shut right down and then a bunch of smoke.  Looking at the scene, I noticed
a few wires melted.
I am going to do this on my own.  Thinking I will have to remove the dash
for easy access.  Is there anything here I should be concerned about?  How
about new wire?  Is it a simple as going to FLAPS and getting wire?  Or is
there something special, certain wire I need?  Then what, just splice and
repair what is melted?
HapyBus seems to do something like this the week before every rip I have
planned.  Supposed to go to Chicago on Wednesday and Whitewater rafting in
WV over the weekend.
Oh well, it will be a great learning experience.
TIA
