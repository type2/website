Subject: Re: [T2] compression check

Problem:  Will I have TOO high compression! !

My '78 runs with 120's plus or minus 10, and I can use regular gas.

The pistons on this '72 are flat, not dished.  There is one shim at the base 
of the cylinders, and the cylinder head gaskets are installed.   I guess the 
PO (a VW fan) may have 'rebuilt' the engine and put in these pistons.

There are some other indications that the engine was 'worked on'.  The heads 
have different suffix letters (I can't remember what they were, but the 1700 
had three varieties of heads.)

Also, there were two regular exhaust valves, and two sodium exhaust valves 
(with the center 'dimple')

* * * * * * * *

Karl, the vacuum picture is giving me fits on this '72 dual PDSIT

(1) The manifold vacuums that pull off the two manifolds have pulsating 
vacuums.  Forget about using a gauge!!  I can draw a tube from each of the 
manifold vacuum ports and touch the tube to my finger.  I can feel and see 
my skin pumping in and out with the vacuum.  With the balance tube, this 
manifold vacuum feeds the brake booster.  Also, on a '72, there is a takeoff 
on the right manifold vacuum boot to work some item in the right arm of the 
air cleaner.   Is this pulsating vacuum normal, or will I see some 
difference now that I have adjusted the valves??  Time will tell

(2) The throttle vacuum from the throttle housing on the left carb and runs 
to the distributor vacuum canister, and it is retard vacuum.   When the VW 
is idling, there is minimal (none) vacuum, partly because the throttle plate 
covers the tiny hair-sized hole at the inside of the throttle housing.  
Trying to suction some air through the green tube, and getting near zero 
results fooled me. I thought I blocked something in my carb.  I did the same 
on an extra PDSIT carb I had on the bench, and I got a great airflow!!  I 
thought I had plugged something up when I out the carb on the manifold.  But 
there is a SMALL  hole cast into the base of the throttle body.  I guess 
that is there so that the TINY hair-sized hole in the throttle housing would 
have somewhere to go. VW had to drill that TINY hole; it is impossible to 
cast the TINY hole.  And they used the SMALL hole (probably drilled) as a 
reservoir that would connect with the outside hole/tube.

But what is the function of the throttle vacuum in the case of  'timing the 
VW'  It does not seem to give much vacuum at idle (no massive air flow past 
throttle at idle, and throttle plate covers hole) so the retard on the 
distributor is not effective.  No throttle vacuum.  Should I just remove 
both vacuum hoses on the distributor and time it at 7.5 BTDC??  It seems to 
like it there...  Faster idle, and all.

(3) The advance vacuum is the top vacuum.  It is in the carb, above the 
throttle vacuum, and  therefore before the manifold vacuum.  This advance 
vacuum comes to one of the two vacuum connectors on the distributor vacuum 
canister.  It comes via the vacuum advance cutoff 'switch'.  Bentley 
describes its function, but leaves some question.  That is, what is the 
normal condition; vacuum flows and is cut off in 4th gear, or vacuum is cut 
off and only flows in 4th gear.  When I apply suction to either side of the 
vacuum advance cutoff switch (on the bench), I get free flow from one side, 
and the other side is stopped up.

What affect will this have on my timing??  If I connect the vacuum advance 
cutoff switch, I feel sure I will not be getting advance vacuum to the 
distributor.  If I run a vacuum line and bypass the VAC switch, will I be 
creating an artificial condition??

Karl, I will experiment further.

Thanks for listening.  I am CC:ing the list as a courtesy.

~ ~ Thanks.  Maybe I have some other problems...
~ ~
~ ~ This is on a '72 dual PDSIT carb engine that is STILL outside the bus, 
but
~ ~ runable.
~ ~
~ ~ Last week, I adjusted the valves (first time in my life, done alone) and 
I
~ ~ took a compression reading on COLD engine
~ ~
~ ~      dry (no squirt of oil)
~ ~ 1   115
~ ~ 2   125
~ ~ 3   120
~ ~ 4   127
~ ~
~ ~ Yesterday, I adjusted the valves per Bentley and added more engine oil. 
I
~ ~ took a compression reading on COLD engine - same as above
~ ~
~ ~       dry    wet
~ ~ 1    130   140
~ ~ 2    140   150
~ ~ 3    145   145
~ ~ 4    145   155
~ ~
~ ~ I read from cyl 1 thru cyl 4.  The engine hadn't started in over 2 
weeks.
~ ~ It has never gotten up to operating temperature in over 10 years..
~ ~
~ ~
~ ~ The compression gauge is good; it is new and last month it was compared 
with
~ ~ two other compression gauges - all three gauges got similar readings, 
near
~ ~ identical most of the time.
~ ~
~ ~ I plan to run the engine at 15 minute intervals, on the garage floor. I 
will
~ ~ check it again after it had a chance to settle in.

~ ~ ~ ~ Hi.
~ ~ ~ ~
~ ~ ~ ~ I know that I should do a compression check on a warm engine, but . 
. .
~ ~ ~ ~
~ ~ ~ ~ will the compression reading on a cold engine be, generally, higher 
or
~ ~ ~ ~ lower than on a warm engine.
~ ~ ~ ~
