&gt;Bad news gang.... I spoke to the gent who owns VW Canvas tonight. He NO LONGER
&gt;does pick-up covers. &quot;Most folks just don't even have the (metal)
&gt;loops anymore, and (he, the owner) couldn't find anyone to make them.&quot;

VanBondo says,
Baloney!!!! Derrick Greg, DG Enterprises, from California has produced
*excellent* repops of the hoops and the wood stays. He had been selling them
(a couple years ago) for around $200.00 for the hoops, I am unsure of the
cost of the wood. Contact Derrick for current availability and costs. Look
for the ad in HotVWs Mag etc. He is the guy with the metalized &quot;collectable&quot;
VW trading cards. He will be at the Arizona Bus Club's Jerome Jamboree Sept
14 and 15th, 1996.

Please tell him that Jim Ellis (that goofy &quot;Rusty VanBondo&quot; guy) from the
Arizona Bus Club sent you via the &quot;internet&quot; list. I get nothing out of it
other than to hook you up with a good hearted guy! Good Luck VW Truckers! =)
