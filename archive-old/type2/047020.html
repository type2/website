&gt; I ordered a new canvas and seals 11 days ago and have not received anything

Ed, none of the orders I have placed with Bus Depot have arrived promptly.
There also does not appear to be a way to know when you place your order (by
phone or otherwise) whether or not the parts you want are in stock.  Placing
an order can be a frustrating experience if you are not sure precisely what
part number you want.  Bus Depot also clearly does not have the best deals on
shipping either.

BUT...., I have always received my parts.  As you mentioned, the prices are
good, and I have always been satisfied with what I've been sold.  On the
occasions when a friend was not satisfied, Bus Depot ( Ron ) has agreed to
make it right.

I own an International Harvester Scout (1966) that I fixed up and drove in
college, and which is now undergoing a frame-off restoration.  Having
experienced the difficulties in finding vendors that stock engine parts for
Internationals, let alone things like window rubber and replacement
upholstery, I was ecstatic to find that air-cooled VW parts are so readily and
cheaply available.

We live in a time in which we have come to expect, and demand, instant service
at the lowest price.  Perhaps we should make allowances for those that are
providing us with a service we ought not to take for granted.  I honestly
believe that Ron is in business for the right reasons and that maybe he is a
better VW enthusiast that he is a businessman.  I have never talked to Ron or
visited his business, so I don't know what he has to work with.  I can
appreciate how hard it must be to hire people who are a good fit for a
specialized business like his.

This may have been a bit long-winded, but this is a topic I have been
discussing at length recently with friends.  Bottom line, if I need in NOW, I
buy from the local foreign car service ( knowledgeable service with a
reasonable inventory, but pricey).  Otherwise, I will patronize businesses
like Bus Depot which make it possible for me to keep a 34 year old vehicle on
the road.

I feel confident that you will receive you order and will be happy, if not, I
encourage to contact Bus Depot and let them know you're not happy.
