Subject: Seeking Seattle, WA VW Shop

I am looking for a some shop recommendations in Seattle, Washington. It 
could also be on the Eastside of the lake.

Specifically, I am first looking to get some brake work done and then I 
want to get a new engine put in. I'll need a 2.0L with heater boxes to 
replace the 1600 with no heater boxes a PO put in. I am kind of a 
Vdummy (this list is helping though) and I'd like to find a shop that 
doesn't mind stupid questions.

Just reply to me and I'll send a compiled reply back to the list. This 
will save everyone's Inbox from having to read about Seattle even 
though you live in Denmark.


Thanks,
Patrick
