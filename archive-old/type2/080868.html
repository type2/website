Hello all,
            As my engine saga continues, I actually find time to think
about something else.  While I did take a rather large amount of
pictures at EB2002, I was unable to get names or information on the
pictures of the bus' that I took.  I was hoping that maybe those who
took a look at the pics and saw them or their bus in it, would email me
and tell me which picture, so that I could put a proper desription with
each of them.  Being my first event, I wanted to make sure that I got
good pics to post on my site.  I plan to have pics of every event I go
to with detailed desriptions of each pic.  I was just so caught up at EB
that I could not get the description part.  Thanks for your help
everyone, with the pics, and my engine. The pics are posted at
http://www.wicals_dot_com/troy/vw/eb2002/eb2002.htm .
