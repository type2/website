&gt; Wow, that is an excellent price as well! All the hardware, damper pipe and
&gt; exhaust tip is included! Everywhere else has all the parts separate. I'll be
&gt; ordering one today.

I'm particularly interested in knowing if the Liestritz muffler is still
available or if they have been taken over by the Ernst folk.  The
Liestritz was worth every penny I spent.  It has proven to be durable, but
eventually I'll need another one and it would be nice if they were
available.
