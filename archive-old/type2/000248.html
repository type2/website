The ad on the web of this gentleman clearly says:

&quot;Westfalia camper, titled as a '71&quot;

In my opnion this indicates that the seller does know that the title does
not correspond with the actual bus. I do not imply that it is a stoleb us
(but might be) but if you are interested in this bus you ought to be
careful. I guess that if this fraud is ever uncovered the then current owner
may be in trouble and at least loose the bus.

A VIN plate can be easily transferred from one vehicle to another but what
about the chassinr that is hammered into the body? Has that been tampered
with too? That's difficult to hide.
