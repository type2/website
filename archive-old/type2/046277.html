Subject: Re: [T2] Is this happening to you?

Yes.
Since I bought my 68 in 1984 I've noted, smugly, the drivers of other
vehicles and even some pedestrians, looking at my Stella with what I can
only call &quot;Bus Envy&quot;.  It's a kind of wistful and sort of soft smile and
gaze.  I KNOW it's not me they're gazing at.  My roommate has a 73 Westy.
We danced delightedly in the living room and out onto the porch when the new
renters moved in across the street with a '68 Westy and a Thing.  VWs make
me grin, even and especially when I'm up against something stuck or, worse,
something stripped in my novice mechanicing.  I've put about 6000 miles on a
new engine (I chose, Jerry &amp; Co. at NW Connecting Rod built and I installed
with lots of help).  In addition to envy people now look with
astonishment...I could keep up in Los Angeles traffic,  pass overheating
watercooleds on the Grapevine and sail, not limp, over The Continental
Divide in Montana. Stella is 'just'a Kombi, not a camper, so I can't sing in
Unca Joe's choir about arriving with the kitchen sink, but I've hauled hay,
transported goats, carried 9 passengers to theater events (not all at once)
and helped friends move their stuff locally and cross country.  All that and
a bus smells and feels GOOD.  My Dad, who wonders how his daughter became a
junior grease monkey, rode with my from Laguna to San Francisco CA in
August.  When I dropped him off he said, &quot;That was fun.&quot; That's the whole
deal, I think. It is fun.

p.s. Nnikki thanks for posting the link to Unca Joe's poems, many grins to
be had there
