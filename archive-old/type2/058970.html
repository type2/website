Subject: '73 VW Westfalia camper- parts bus

Hi,

If anyone in the Winnipeg, Canada area is looking for parts I've got a
'73 bus I was planning on restoring but after taking a good look at the
frame have decided to sell it as is or for parts. It's badly rusted
around the sliding door rail and the floor but there may be something of
interest to someone. Email me if you want to have a look at it.

Kevin
