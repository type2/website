Subject: Re: need van parts source

&gt;I've just purchased an '82 GL (to keep my '84 GL company in the driveway)
&gt;and, rather than rob the cosmetic parts from my '84, I'd like to find a 
&gt;source of new/used parts (preferrably close to me north of Boston). I've 
&gt;got a list a mile long so I wont bother listin' em till I get my needs 
&gt;under control. My first request......A source of reasonably priced parts 
&gt;to snaz up my '82!

I'm parting out 2 Vanagon's, an '85 Westfalia and an '87 Wolfsburg, in case 
you need anything.  Can ship.
