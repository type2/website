Subject: Looking to close AC compresser hole. Need Sheet Metal.

My 1975 bus used to have ac, but the P.O. removed the compressor and
other vital parts. Getting close to finishing the rebuild on the engine
and would like to close the missing sheet metal that was apparently cut
out to make room for the compressor. If anyone is parting out a bay
window bus that never had ac and is willing to cut a piece out of the
engine compartment for me, please let me know.
