Subject: Re: [T2] 12vDC vs 120v AC for a fridge (was power converter
  sources.)

Okay Bro,

Your Wal-Mart fridge runs on 120v AC (what you have in a house). A Westy
fridge is either 12v DC or propane. You can turn 12v DC into 120v AC using
an Inverter (not to be
confused with a Converter, which just changes the voltage of DC current),
but there is some loss of efficiency. Also, you would require a larger
capacity, and higher quality (modified or true sine-wave) inverter than the
ones you have seen at Wal-Mart (square-wave), and a very large battery bank
(read heavy, large, expensive) to handle the load. To keep this battery bank
full you would need either a Generator, or to spend most of a 24 hour period
with your engine running. All in all, not a good solution, unless you intend
to be plugged in with a long extension cord.

If you must have a reefer, (It is Friday;) look for a 12v DC marine or RV
fridge, and redesign your charging and battery system. I don't have any
experience with the propane units, so hopefully someone else will chime in.

There is lots of info available on basic electrics online or in your local
library, or p mail me if you have any specific questions. One place to find
some very accessible info to get you started thinking in 12v is
www.westmarine_dot_com . (They are the ... Depot of the boating world.) Click on
&quot;West Advisors&quot;, scroll down to &quot;Electrics&quot;, and substitute the word &quot;bus&quot;
for &quot;boat&quot;.

Cheers,
Matthew
Living luxuriously on 12v.
