Subject: Crankcase Sealing Question
References: &lt;199811260708.AAA10804_at_yiff.azaccess_dot_com&gt;

I have searched the archives, and can't find what I'm looking for.  I am
putting back together a 1.8 from my '75, and I was wondering what the best
sealing method for the crankcase is.  It was mentioned that Permatex 3D works
good under the jugs, will this work on the crankcase too?  Where do you get
it?  My FLAPS looks at me real funny when I ask for it...

TIA,
Robert &amp; Gofar
