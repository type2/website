Subject: Re: [T2] Type IV Rebuild

Bentleys list the
FI engines from '75+ as a GD motor and that lists at
70 HP (DIN) _at_ 4200 rpm
67 HP (SAE) _at_ 4200 rpm
14.3 mkg (DIN) _at_ 2800 rpm
101.0 ftlb (SAE) _at_ 3000 rpm

Boston Bob did the work on my 2L and i've been one happy camper with both
his work and pre/post sale service.

&gt; fellas,
&gt;
&gt; i have recently aquired a 79 engine from a junkyard. i
&gt; would now like to have it rebuilt so that i can put it
&gt; into my 76 westy. i am aware of raby's aircooled
&gt; technology, and boston bob, is anyone aware of anyone
&gt; else who does Type IV rebuilds well, i would like to
&gt; shop around as much as possible before dropping
&gt; thousands of dollars. i am on the east coast in
&gt; allentown, PA if that is pertanent.
&gt;
&gt; also, just because i would like to know, does anyone
&gt; out there know how much horsepower a factory 2.0 FI
&gt; 2000cc Type IV engine puts out? and, is there any
&gt; difference in power between a 76 and a 79 engine?
&gt; Thanks in advance.
