Subject: [T2] Convert STD to HDY lifters  Wash DC area

Same junkyard as before..

The '78 BUS is sitting out in the ready yard, not out in the field.

You can spend the next few hours pulling the pieces you really need to 
convert the solid lifters from your pre-'78 to the hydraulic lifters  of a 
'78; the thing that you adjust, the posh rods, and the hyd lifters (get a 
strong magnet on a stick from Trak Auto to pull the hydraulic lifters.

Forget about the cam unles you are really into that kid of thing.

I went for the EGR filter, but that was pulled already.  In fact, this is 
the second time I came a 'day late' on ERGR filters, and it may be that the 
yard people got the,)

What else is good on the '78??  It has air conditioning, but no compressor, 
if you are looking for any parts.  Joe??

It has a clock in the instrument panel

Seats are there, don't remember condition.

Looks pretty solid, otherwise.  Lens are mostly gone.  Don't know if it is a 
California bus; didn't look.
