Subject: Fw: [T2] re H4 headlamp conversion

There's no DOT on the lenses, there is E4 in a circle. They may not be legal
for sale in the US market, I don't know. Canada does have pretty similar
standards to the US.

&lt;Worth every penny right? Now it's easy to understand the skepticism towards
spending the money on them because they have to be seen to be believed.

The lenses didn't say Motorcycle on the bottom BTW, as
&gt;I've heard others comment.

Is it doesn't say DOT either you have a euro bulb instead of a us spec. No
real difference as they both produce the superior ECE lighting pattern.
