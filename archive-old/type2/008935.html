81 Vangon Westy - 
HELP! - Can someone tell me where the O-Ring goes on the fan hub?  I cant
tell if it supposed to go on the very back of the hub (towards front of
van) or if it fits in the slight groove just in back of the flank with
the threaded holes.  I gettting to the end of this engine re-build and I
don't seem to have an o-ring that fits the groove (unless I stretch it
slightly) but I do have one that fits in the back.

If you have an answer, please p-mail because I trying to wrap this up
since help arrives tomorrow to get the engine out of my basement!

Thanks - john reynolds
