Hi all,

A friend has asked me for advice on the purchase of a Bubble widshield
Single-Cab.  One of the issues on it is that it will need a right rear
corner, the lower 12 to 15 inches anyway.  Could anyone recommend a source
for, or possibly sell him one before he decides whether to take on this
restoration of an otherwise fairly straight and complete S.C.?  He's in the
decision mode right now.  Thanks for any assistance and/or leads!

Bill Bowman
