Subject: List Members in Raleigh, NC

Hi,

I am trying to find a list member in Raleigh, NC that has a digital 
camera and  would be willing to drop by Transporter Werks and take 
some pictures of the 71 Adventurewagen that is for sale. If you would 
like to volunteer please reply to ncbus_at_mindspring_dot_com.

Thanks
Chris
