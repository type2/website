Subject: '71 brake troubles

Hello all,
  I was just given a $700 quote to replace the calipers and rotors on my 
left pulling Westy.  After I regained my breath, the first thing I said
was &quot;don't do anything&quot;.  It looks like I'm due for a new level of
understanding with my bus:  the caliper rebuild.  I'm not sure what to do
about the rotors.
  Is there a way around having to do this?  If not, then I'll get out the
Bentley and get started.  My thought is this:

  If I'm going to be essentially going down to the hub, should I scavenge
some rotors and calipers off of a '73 or later vehicle and do them
instead?  Better hardware, more availability of parts, cheaper(?), being
the benefits.  Has anyone done this and is it worth the trouble of getting
together the parts?
