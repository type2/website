Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for an 009 distributor - have '80 distributor
  for trade

Mike,
I found my 009! I don't feel any play in it, but that's my opinion. If you 
want to trade, I'll send it to you so you can check it out. If it's good, 
send me the 80 distributor, if you find it has play in it, just send it 
back. Is your dizzy a points or hall sensor type? I would like either one.
Thanks
Tom

&gt; Hey Everyone,
&gt; I need an 009 distributor in good condition (no play) so that I can open
&gt; it up and lock out the advance mechanism.  I have a 1980 distributor out
&gt; of a running bus if that's worth anything to anyone that I'd be willing
&gt; to trade.
