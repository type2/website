Subject: Re: Why double-walled U-pipe Exhaust?
Message-Id: &lt;4.2.0.58.19990924094416.009fd8b0_at_pop.multipro_dot_com&gt;

As I understand it, part of the pollution controls on these engines - since 
there is no catalytic convertor - were these pipes. The engine was designed 
to allow some combustion of the exhaust gases to continue inside the 
exhaust manifolds and the U turns were double walled so the gases would 
stay hot enough to support the combustion.

So do you need these? No, unless you worry about what comes out your 
exhaust pipe. That is to say, mechanically, and audibly, and whatever else 
- you don't have to have these, unless you have to pass smog checks and are 
having troubles. What I would like to now is if you can make one of these 
engines clean enough through a tune up without the double walled pipes.

Incidentally my bus has none either. It wasn't until I rolled under a 
friend's '78 Riviera fresh from New Mexico, that I ever saw these for the 
first time. Her's are beginning to disappear now too. My bus is from New 
Mexico too but has been in TN at least 4 or 5 years now and the Tennessee 
winters has aged these fragile parts greatly/quickly. Salty winter roads!! 
Wish they'd leave that stuff off the roads.

Take care!

&gt;Friday's Trivia Question:
&gt;On the 1800 (and other engines?), the U-pipes connecting the exhaust
&gt;manifolds to the heat exchangers are double-walled. Why? Noise
&gt;reduction, heat conservation/fire protection, mechanical protection?
&gt;Anyway, the outer thin- walled shells have long since rusted thru at
&gt;the ends and the things just kind of flop around on the underlying
&gt;pipes. The replacements are terribly pricey the last time I checked.
&gt;Should I worry? Has anyone figured out a way to re-sleeve these
&gt;effectively? Bentley says nothing about this.  Your ideas  would be
&gt;much appreciated.
