No real VW content here, except maybe an attitude about life.  I saw these on my
way into work this morning next to each other, and I think it might have made my
day.

&quot;Business is Great,
People are Terrific,
Life is Wonderful&quot;

next to this one was one that said;

&quot;Eat More Watermelons&quot;

Overall, I can't say either of these is a bad philosophy for life.

peace,
terry
