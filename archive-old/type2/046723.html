Hi Brad,

No way does the cam get changed without splitting the case.

I have just replaced the cam on my '77 2.0L.  It is not really that
hard.  I spent a few hundred on parts and a few hunderd on tools and
about $30 on a book to do it (Hayes in my case).  Compared to the
estimates, I think I saved ~$1500.

It took three weekends, but I was not working that hard on any of the
days.  Maybe 25hrs in total, plus the time I spent cycling around to get
parts.  If you look into it, you can get a bunch of this done while your
bus is still running.  The type2 list has a lot of info on doing this.

It helps to clean the engine the engine exterior before removal from the
van.  Have some friend around to help for removing the engine and when
it comes time to put it back in.  Then just follow the steps in the
book.  

Once you learn to do it yourself, you save money in the long run (even
without break downs, we all know VWs dont break down), since you do not
have to pay for tune-ups, etc.

Good luck.

Chris
