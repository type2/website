Subject: Re: [T2] insanity approaches!?!?

oh great and wise list......

I went out to my 78 2Liter (stock) auto tranny bus this afternoon to try
and track down a small engine miss....never found the miss I guess because
it is so intermittent, but found something else that has me totally
mystified.

#3  when cranked sounds like the valves aren't closing, you hear an air
rush when it compresses.  HOWEVER, the compression tester shows it right
on the money and within a lb or so of the other cyl....?  if the cyl leaks
how does it compress??   was unable to do a leakdown test, for unrelated
reasons.

  now the hsssst hsssst hsssst occurs on every crank when running  the
starter, (I know it is #3, remove the spark plug and it vanishes) but
engine starts right up, you can still hear it at idle, but once the RPM
gets up the sound goes away....

I know what a cyl blow by sounds like, this isn't that.  and when the
engine is running exhaust sounds normal..  I have never been able to get
this engine since rebuilding (2+ years) to idle smoothly but get it on the
road and it runs so smooth you can hardly hear the engine.   last week I
went from Baltimore to near Pittsburgh, anyone who knows the Pa Turnpike
between Harrisburg and Somerset knows that it has a few long grades that
knock trucks down onto thier low gears...my 71 was lucky to keep up 40mph
on the hill to Allegany tunnel.  this bus just cruised on up hitting the
tunnel at about 60mph........

so what the heck is this sound, where is it coming from, and most
ominously why does it not seem to affect the engine performance...and it
has been going on for a few months.

now today I checked the compression, checked the valves (hyd), even
removed the rocker arms....everything is right on spec.  (visible head
bolts are tight)

I'm stumped....

???? intake valve not closing tightly ???? looks like it is though

thanks
Bob
