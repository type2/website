&gt; I stripped the #3 plug on my 71 westy  and as I am short on time/space to
&gt; pull the engine, the quick fix treatment is all she gets right now.
&gt; 
&gt; My question is, can I pull the head on my 1600 DP without removing the
&gt; engine? If so, what hoops do I need to jump thru to make this possible?

The quick fix *is* to pull the engine and take the head off. For this
repair, the engine doesn't have to come out from under the Bus. You'll need
a set of rings and a ring compressor just in case you &quot;accidentally&quot; pull
the cylinders off while removing the head--carbon buildup makes this easier
to do than you want to think.

Drop the engine, pull the head, put in the helicoil, replace rings on any
cylinder that got pulled off with the head, put the head back on, torque
both heads and reinstall the engine. If you were to do this on January 3
(not that you can wait that long) and you started at 7AM, you'd have time to
see Florida State stomp either Oklahoma or Miami for the national
championship.
