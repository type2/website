Subject: AridZona TNT FREE show and swap

The weather could not be better. Free swap space,  free car show, of which
some 50 VWs showed up  Trophies, .25 cent Hot dogs    good stuff in the swap
meet. Thanks to Tony of TNT for this free VW Gift. As usual some clubs did
not come out to support the show.  How the heck can you stay away when it's
FREE? The blocked off street was filled curb to curb with Classy VWs. The
grand raffle prize of the 1900 short block that was easy to take. It wasn't
me, bummer. Also my thanks to all of you out there that helped me walk the
car show and swap meet. It was not a very good day for me, but through
friends I made it, and Magoo. Have no idea where I would be without her.
There are more free food and shows coming up. Will you be there?, uj
