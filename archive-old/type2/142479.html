&gt;The 2.0 retains the original FI system and

&gt;used less than a quart and a half of oil the whole trip, and at
&gt;fueling stops it was cool enough that I could rest my hand on the
&gt;metal fan housing. I averaged between 21 and 23 mpg at mostly highway
&gt;speeds.

Excellent!

&gt;the only thing I need to do pretty quick is
&gt;replace the &quot;headliner,&quot; as someone removed all of the vinyl facing on
&gt;the plywood in the back, and covered the front portion with a padded
&gt;fabric headliner that has since fallen down.

The TX heat probably melted it off.
