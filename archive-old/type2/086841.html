&gt; OK, after many helpful list responses and calling around to my local shop
&gt; and the tire companies, it looks like my main choices are thus:
&gt; 
&gt; Michelin Agilis61 in 185R14 at about $120/tire.
&gt; 
&gt; Continental CR21 reinforced (load range C) in 185R14 at about $80/tire.
&gt; Yokohama Y356 in 185R14, price unknown (anybody want to let me know?)
&gt; Kumho Commercial A/S 852 in 185R14C load range D, price unknown.
&gt; 
&gt; As it is I'm very strongly leaning toward the Michelin but the price on that
&gt; Continental is looking pretty decent.  Is the Michelin really $40 better?

yes!
&gt; 
&gt; I know Michelin makes great tires but I've never had Continental tires
&gt; before on anything.

I have had em and didn't like em, but they came on the van and the
condition was ????

&gt; Thanks for all your help, folks.  Vandals suck!

yeah and I hope they stay away from my Michelin MXT's
