Kinda funny, I've been trying for several years to get the DMV here in NC to 
let me get my '78 Westy listed as an RV. No such luck. And oddly enough, my 
Allstate Agent tells me that the Insurance Industry considers the Westy a 
station wagon, not a &quot;Temporary Dwelling, &quot; or an RV of any kind. Guess it 
varys from state to state.
