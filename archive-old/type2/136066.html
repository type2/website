Subject: Re: [T2] Stolen Emblem/MTV Pimp My Ride

&gt; Yeah, if memory serves me correctly, one of the Beastie Boys wore a big VW 
&gt; emblem on a chain around his neck in the late 80's. 

Very true, evident in a few videos. In the Pimp my Ride episode Xzibit even said &quot;the Beastie Boys will F you up&quot; when the surfer guy said he could wear it around his neck.

&gt;  This was back when Flavor Flav (from Public Enemy) 
&gt; was running around with clocks hanging from his neck.  Good times.

Flava still wears a clock around his neck! Gotta give it up for Flava, Public Enemy changed the way I listen music.
