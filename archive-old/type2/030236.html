&gt; Hello everyone-
&gt; I've got a '77 FI Westy w/o electronic ignition--should I change this?  
&gt; Second, and more importantly, it won't start after it's been running great 
&gt; since it's tune up.  Anyhow, here are the symptoms:  Completed a 400 mile 
&gt; round trip runnin smooth as silk, parked it that night, and the next morning 
&gt; it just sits there and cranks but no start.  I can smell gas, so I don't 
&gt; think it's the injectors.  I checked for spark coming out of the coil into 
&gt; the center of the distributor and found I had a small, yellowish-white spark 
&gt; that would only spark if it was about 1/8&quot; away from a ground.  Also, my 
&gt; coil gets EXTREMELY hot even when I'm only using the radio.  Could my coil 
&gt; be shot?  If so, this would be my second coil within probably 1500 miles.  
&gt; What would be causing this if it's the problem?  I haven't checked my plugs 
&gt; for spark yet as they're new, but I guess that would tell me if my 
&gt; coil/condesor was fine, correct?  Any input in the matter would be greatly 
&gt; appreciated!

Sounds like you fried your coil by using the &quot;on&quot; ignition position to
listen to the radio.  Teh VW has no &quot;accessory&quot; position so if your radio
is wired to the ignition switch you must run the engine to listen to the
radio.  Some wire the radio to an &quot;always hot&quot; source on the fuse block,
but that means that the radio will not go off when the ignition is turned
off.

In any case, try a new coil.  Even if the one you have is good, you should
keep a spare around.
