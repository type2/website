Subject: O'Leno campout sites

Just a clarification: each site holds 2 vehicles max and I have 
reserved ONE site, ie, my site sharing with my brother &amp; family (ie, 
site 35 is full).  If you call or reserve online, you have to get your 
own site (or go in with someone).  I think maybe some people were 
wondering if by site I meant a big area where we could all camp.  Nope.

It's possible to just show up and they may have a site for you, but it 
would be better to reserve one.  I think they limit each site to 8 
persons max or something like that - it's on the O'Leno State Park 
website.

Nightmares of 20 people showing up thinking they were all camping in my 
site - augh :-)
Joe
