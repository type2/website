Subject: Re: [T2] can i get a starter by tomorrow?

The chances of that happening are slim-

Why do you think the starter is fried---??

It just doesn't spin?--Or what?

thanks yall
do you think bob since you always have it rebuilt.... do you think when
the big wire on the big bolt touched the smalledr plug wire it burnt the
brushes up? i dont know much about starters except for i have been told
before people just putting new brushes in them so thats why i say what i
do!

I am going to check around today and see if i can find a starter

check the phone book of any decent sized city for a starter/alternator
rebuilder. I have never bought a starter, I have all mine rebuilt by a
local guy who seems to know what he is doing have never had one go South
on me.._dot_usually one day service and a lot less than a new or store
bought rebuilt (which is what this guy does for some of the local FLAPS)
