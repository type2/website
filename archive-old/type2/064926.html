Subject: goodbye and thanks for all the memories

Sorry guys but after months of lurking and searching for a nice 
VW I have failed.  Mission Impossible.  So I have changed allegiances 
and bought a mini cooper s.  It seems that for my money (1500UKP) I 
could either choose a nail of a VW or a very nice mini.  Not really 
any choice in the matter.

So I'd just like to thank you all for an entertaining six months 
listening to all your ramblings and I hope to be back when I have 
secured a show standard squareback for myself.  I'm sure there must 
be hundreds around!

Aufwiederhoren
Mathias.
