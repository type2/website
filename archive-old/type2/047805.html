Subject: Re: [T2] How long can a westy run?

Tim.... when Bob Perring gets back from his midwest swing, ask him how long a 
Westy can run.  Bob started out in Huston, TX in Casper, his '70 Westy about 
3 weeks ago.... has been all the way up to Cleveland, out to St. Louis.... 
and has a few more weeks to go before getting back to Huston.... ya might ask 
him how many miles he has put on this trip alone.

As for me, I recently purchase a '78 Westy, the Pumba wagon, (half owner) 
that Richard and Gayle Millar purchased in Huston early this year, and 
traveled all around the USA.... up here to Colorado, out to the west coast, 
up to Canada, down thru the Dakotas and out to New York, down thru the 
Carolinas and the Blue Ridge Parkway, all the way down to Key West, Florida, 
then back to Huston.... about 36,000 miles all total.  I put in a Compufire 
module in Huston at Bob Perry's, changed the oil, and drove it back up here 
to Colorado Springs, CO.  I also have a '71 Camper that is my daily driver 
and eventualy plan on driving from here to Indiantown, Florida... about 2500 
miles one way.

By this time, I expect you have been inundated with tales of how far Westies 
can go..... Jamie Rivers from Canada to New Mexico and back, Nikki from 
California to Texas and back ...even after getting up close and personal with 
a Texas Deer.... Lauria Watts from California to Alaska and back .... and the 
names roll on and on.....I think you could safely say that they can go 
anyplace you want to go.... if you have tuned them, prepared them and love 
them.... and change out the gas lines, put on the proper tires and keep your 
head centered and your speed around 60 mph....
