Subject: 65 Riveria Parts for sale

I am finnaly getting around to selling parts from the 65 Riveria Campmobile 
that was stripped &amp; junked this summer.

Window washer fluid res. (works)  $5.00

Sink (hose and hose adapt. gone) $5.00

Pump for water to sink (works / with inlet tube) $15.00

Glass - front door glass(2 pieces ea) / R &amp; L side / with latches and most 
rubber slides.  $25.00 per side.

Also have crank windows for cargo doors and they work. $20.00 each.

Air Cleaner - this is the type that attached to the top of the engine 
compartment and looks like a flying saucer.  Hose to top-of-carb piece is 
ripped but easly replaced.  Rusted but sound (needs paint).  $25.00

Curtian rail for front windows - this is a prototype setup(?) - the inside 
of the rails are marked &quot;sample&quot;.  There are 2 pieces (aluminum) of equal 
size that meet in the middle of the split window and attach with screws to 
the body of the bus.  The rear view mirror mounts on the surface of the 
rail where they meet.  The rear portion of the rail ends just behind the 
front seats.  The curtian hangers are bent nails with the heads running in 
the rail.  This is NOT Westy stuff.  $25.00

Please email me if you need more info. mottware_at_ix_dot_netcom_dot_com
