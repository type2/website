Subject: working under da bus

I donno.. jack stands make me nervous.. I would use the jack stands
but pull the wheel off and put a ramp under the brake drum. If the
jack stand were to give it up then you have the ramp as a safety..
Course I am a tad claustrophobic. :-O I will use jackstands but also
have a bunch of short pieces of 2X4.. I make a crib with the 2X4's
for a safety net.. the thought of a bus coming down on me just creeps
me out a bit.
