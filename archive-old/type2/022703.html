&gt;&gt; SA is the non detergent spec, i believe. Looks like you found the ND oil
you were looking for.  Now, the volkswagen type 1 was designed for ND oil,
wasn't it... So wouldn't anything exceeding SA be okay? &lt;&lt;

Way back when, some engines (maybe VWs too? I don't know)  used fiber timing
gears and such and you don't want high-detergent oil for those, but
otherwise, NEVER use a ND oil.  Just asking for trouble.
