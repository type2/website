&gt;Along the front edge of the existing top, there is a rubber seal between
&gt;the top and the bus roof, it appears to be a solid piece of rubber split
&gt;down the middle.  The old one is falling apart and will completely fall
&gt;apart when I start moving it out of the way to get to the screws holding
&gt;the roof on.  I was wondering if anyone has replaced their top on a high
&gt;top bus before, and what did you use to replace this piece of rubber?

Mine does not have rubber there - it has some gummy stuff that looks like 
weatherstripping.

&gt;I plan on using Butyl (??) tape between the top and the roof on the other
&gt;three sides of the bus.  This tape is a clay like material in a roll with
&gt;an adhesive side.  Is that what most people used?  Seems to me that is
&gt;what was used on the original roof.

All I can say is that Butyl (??) is awesome stuff.  Just got done using it 
in the replacement of my rear quarter windows in the Mustang.  The stuff is 
amazing - sticks to anything and will not come loose without a fight.  I 
would not hesitate to use it in place of the piece of rubber you had there 
originally.  If my highroof ever comes off, that stuff will get the nod to 
seal it back to the roof.  Go for it - you won't be disappointed.
