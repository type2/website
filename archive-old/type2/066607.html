        There are different pleasures in different kinds of driving-
Late one night, on the way to a National Forest area to camp in the
rough, we took a country road detour. It was late, and under a full
moon, we turned off the headlamps and proceded gently by the light
of the moon and our running lights. Going about 25 mph, we covered about
25 miles in about an hour. Glorious.

        Later that same trip, we wound up 1 from Moro (sp?) Bay to
Pfieffer/Big Sur. Exhausting, and I was never so happy to stop
and lay down for a sleep. 

        Sometimes 500+mph at 41,000 feet sounds like the perfect deal. 
Sometimes you're 19, only have one weekend and really want to see someone 
in Portland.

        John McPhee's &quot;Assembling California&quot; makes a great guide book
to the geology of my home state. Besides a lot of interesting talk,
the book is a tour of the road-cuts along 80, from the coast east, 
back in time, through the various bits of lighter rock that got
scraped off the oceanic plate as it subducted beneath the coast.

        It starts at the old dump site, now a park, in Colma, where
Skyline Drive (not Blvd) comes to an end. If you take the trail into the
park and down to the 3 story rock off shore that McPhee says is caught
in the fault, You can look south and see vertical splits in the rock: 
The San Andreas Fault runs under the sea from this point until the bay
south and east of Point Reyes. The fault itself continues north
and runs down the center of Tomales Bay.
