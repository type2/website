Subject: pushrod help!

Ok, So I am in the middle of working on the pushrod tube seals right
now, 
And the new ones I put in, ALL Of them are cut up. No wonder its
leaking. The wide end by the valves is really sharp. Should I take
something to those sharp edges to file that down? I cleaned it up really
well, but those edges are so sharp, im afraid they will just end up
getting all cut up again if I put them back in with the new seals. 

Any suggestions before I put them back into place, possibly cutting them
all up again in the process? 

The smaller ends are all ok, so im leaving those alone. 

Best,
Christopher
