Subject: 1600 Rebuild Q's

The rebuild of my 1600 (well, 1500 H Case as a 1600) is going veeerrrrry 
slooooooow, but I did manage to pressure wash the case the other day and 
pick up some tools I needed (with mixed success).

Couple Questions though:

1) I need to balance the rods end for end, right?  Each end should be 
roughly the same weight (+/- 0.5 g) as the others?  Or do I just balance 
the total mass of the rod.  I didn't see any reference to end-for-end 
balancing in Wilson or How to Hot Rod...

2) I looked at my main bearing seats and there are a couple of scratches 
on the surface.  I'm pretty sure that the case came this way from the 
machinist (I should have paid a little more attention, perhaps!) but I'm 
not positive.  I suspect it's important that these surfaces be smooth as a 
baby's bum, how do I get from here (mild surface scratch) to there?  
Sparing use of Crokus Cloth, perhaps?

3) Do I need to plastigage the clearance on my main crank bearings (given 
that I'll be trying to remove these scratches!), or just the rod bearings?
I didn't notice any mention of doing the former, but it seems like it 
would be a sensible thing...

Again, any insights, thoughts, and/or opinions are most welcome.

Thanks!

	Tom
