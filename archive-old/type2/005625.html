Subject: Pluc-a-tah, Pluc-a-tah noise from RR wheel...

Oh great - my 73 Westy knows I am about to leave on a 2 week trip to
Mexico...Yesterday I took rotated the rear suspension torsion bars one
splign to adjust my ride height back to normal...after bolting everything
back together, I noticed a vibration under power in 2nd &amp; 3rd gears...when I
make a RH turn under power I get the pluc-a-tah, pluc-a-tah noise from the
RH side...I removed the RH half shaft and checked both CV joints, thinking I
had 'dropped' a ball or something without knowing...everything looked
OK...pulled the brake drum and wheel carrier (by the way an 1-13/16&quot; x 3/4
drive socket fits the axle nut just right) to peek at the outer hub
bearing...looked a little dry in there, but I didn't go any further until I
can get some new bearings &amp; seals...the shaft has a little movement, so new
bearings will probably be in order (140K miles) anyway...My local guru tells
me that type2's almost never have rear wheel bearing problems...

My real question is, why did the noise start now?...all I did to adjust the
torsion bars was to remove the shocks, unbolt the brake line, unbolt the hub
assembly from the spring plate - do the spline thing, and put everything
back together....any ideas, anyone...if I had a worn CV joint, would it only
make thumping noise in a turn like this, or would it thump any time when
power was applied??...also, if you get off the power in a RH turn, the
thumping quits...and it doesn't thump in a LH turn or straight ahead, except
for the vibration mentioned above...any suggestions would be greatly
accepted from the many experts out there that may have run into similar
symptoms...thanks.
