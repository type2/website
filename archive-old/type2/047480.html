Subject: [T2] New bus owner question

I just recently purchased a 73 westfalia. I am trying to replace this
missing part in the engine but have no idea what it is called. It connects
from the heater box up to the engine tin. This piece is where the heater fan
hose connects to. This is on the left side of the engine. The previous owner
just ran the hose all the way from the fan onto the heater box. I guess
either that part was lost when they rebuilt the engine or just never had it.
