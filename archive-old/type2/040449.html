Subject: lower bus

Hi All

I'm slowly going through the suspension on my 71 Westy.

I'm now looking at getting new shocks. What has amazed
me is the price range of what's available.
Is there an overwhelming choice of shock for (stock) VW Buses?
I would like the bus set up for comfortable highway driving
even though I plan on using it as a commuter to work sometimes.

Next, in looking through catalogs (for suspension parts)
I've seen lowering kits to &quot;improve handling.&quot; Apparently
the component that lowers everything is a new, but shorter
spring.
Anyone out there have experience or opinions on this?
A given is no off road driving. I wouldn't want something
slammed to the ground either...

Thanks

Pete
