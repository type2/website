&gt; &gt; I see it but I dont get how it works. So simple?
&gt;
&gt; The big end goes on the gland nut. The little end meshes with the
&gt; flywheel teeth and that's where you drive it with your torque wrench:

&gt;
&gt; Applying 30 ft.lbs on your wrench equals 270 ft.lbs on the gland nut.

Provided that the gear drive is 100% efficient!  Probably a bit less,
otherwise.

I prefer the time honored &quot;measure 18 inches along the wrench, then stand
on that spot with my 180 pounds&quot; approach.  A long piece of angle iron
bolted to the flywheel keeps it from turning.

This approach works fine for breaking the nut loose too, with a cheater
over the wrench.
