Subject: Re: [T2] Bay windshield installation

&gt; Glass shops use silicone spray.&gt;
&gt;  &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Then go to a body and paint shop and ask their opinion about silicone...
&gt; I'm on a couple of other lists for old cars and the guys with lots of
&gt; money tied up in their restorations swear at silicone... ;-(

Well it is damn slippery and the glass guys probably dont worry too much
about what happens months after your glass is in. they just want make the
job easier.
&gt;
So aht exactly is the complaint about anyway?
