This all sounds like a variation of what came with the 74 Beetle. 
The 74 Beetle (Federal) had an EGR system.  The muffler had an
additional tap that went to a external filter ($$$ to replace).  The
output of the filter went to a vacuum operated valve that was
connected to the manifold just below the carb.  Unless you lived in
California you probably got rid of the filter and went back to the
standard muffler when any of this stuff needed repair.

The only reason I mention this is that alot of Beetle stuff creeps
into buses during the course of 35 years especially in the design of
after market parts that try to cover a wide range of upright engines.

&gt;my heat riser had a threaded hole in it. that's the way it came from 
&gt;the
&gt;previous owner. it was a california vehicle.  for cali emissions, a 
&gt;tube
&gt;was installed from the riser to the manifold. actually, there was a 
&gt;nifty
&gt;gadget that was placed between the carb and the manifold to recieve 
&gt;the
&gt;tube neatly. if yours spent time in california, the thing that comes 
&gt;to my
&gt;mind is emissions.  - steve
