Subject: Re: [T2] Floppy vent wing- how to tighten?

While on the subject of vent wing pivots, I will be reassembling mine
shortly and was wondering what the preferred tool is for crimping the new
top rivet? I was thinking of using  a strong pair of pliers and a BB stuck
into the rivet hole in order to spread the rivet wall.

off.

|
| The rear vent windows suffer the sheared shaft fate about 50% of the time.
