Subject: Re: [T2] 68 Baywindow Wheel Locked Up 

ok

the steering wheel advice was bad.
you adjust the steering wheel position by changing the length of the drag
link.
here is some info on it from the t2 library.
http://www.type2_dot_com/library/suspens/swhal.htm

on the brakes
this is likely to be a flexible brake hose collapsed on the side where the
dribbling fluid was found.
you should probably replace all 4 while you are doing brakes.

if it is both rears are locking up it could be possibly the flex hoses on
both sides or could be a problem with the master cylinder or perhaps push
rod adjustment.
