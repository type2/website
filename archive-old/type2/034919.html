Subject: LA Junkyard

For you folks in the Los Angeles area, don't bother going to the &quot;Pull Your
Part&quot; junkyard in Anaheim. I took my son to a coin show at the Embassy
Suites which is right next to the junkyard. The whole east side of the hotel
looks down into a scrap metal yard, and the junkyard. I hadn't been to this
junkyard for a couple of reasons, now I remember why... there are hardly any
busses in the yard. Came across 3 busses, all were pretty well stripped with
no motors or related components. The only worthy parts seemed to be side
windows, and the front window on the '71. So.. there is an 82 vanagon, 83
vanagon, and a 71 bus, none are Westys.

Go there is you are desperate, its at the 91 fwy and Glassell, right behind
the multi-storied Embassy Suites Hotel.
