&gt;    Hooey -- the airflow works just fine with them gone. They are

Gotta back up Jazz on this one.  While the cooling air will be blown 
onto the head fins even without the flaps, the air will not be 
distributed evenly and to all the &quot;nooks and crannies&quot; that it would if 
the flaps were in place.  Uneven cooling = head warpage and other weird 
things.  I would now normally cite the Hoover sermons but I guess I 
can't do that anymore.  Perhaps some info on this can be dug up in the 
archives.


&gt; -- what really causes overheating is too
&gt;lean a fuel mixture (wrong jets and/or not enough exhaust back 
pressure)
&gt;and ignition advanced too far. 

Yep, these will definitely cause serious overheating problems.
