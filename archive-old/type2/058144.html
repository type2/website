&gt;Hi List,
&gt;Real quick, Will the &quot;BIG&quot; transaxle and 2.0 l eng bolt up to my 72 without
&gt;any mods to shift rods or mounts or anything?  They seem to measure about
&gt;the same..... Any advice?

The 091 trans is 1/2 inch longer and the 091 bellhousing is another 1/2&quot;
longer, for a total of one inch difference.  It will fit, but the front
trans mount may be a little off.  If you can, use the front mount from the
original trans.  As another listmember already said, the shift rod will be
the wrong length - you will probably have to shorten it.

I put an  091 in my '73 with the '73 bellhousing (1/2 inch total longer)
and was able to get by without modifying the shift rod - the gearshift was
just slightly farther back than it was before in each gear.
