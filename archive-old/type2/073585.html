Subject: Re:  '71 disc brake questions

Can the piston positioner plates be purchased as a separate item? If so. . .
where?

&gt; 
&gt; There should be a pair of piston positioner plates in there.
&gt; these are the same shape as the pad backing plates, but with 
&gt; two cutout and bent notches to hold the pistons in the 
&gt; correct position.  I forget what the correct position is, but 
&gt; it seems to me that it the pistons would creep around in use 
&gt; as they are applied over and over.  VW put those plates in 
&gt; for some reason!

&gt; &gt; caliper without it? I have the notch on the piston surface pointing 
&gt; &gt; down as to avoid water pooling in there. I assume this is correct.
