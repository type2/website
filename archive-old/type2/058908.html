Subject: Points Burned Up?

I just heard that letting a bus sit with the ignition switch on, but without the engine running (listening to the radio, etc) can burn up your points!?

Can anybody confirm this?

I've been trying to track down the cause of a really strange surging idle and a loss of power overall and a mechanic friend asked if that might be the problem.

Is replacing the points a tough thing to do? Anybody got any helpful hints?

Thanks,
