Subject: BN-4 wiring diagrams and PDF, Ontario Camping
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

First off, I have converted the BN4 wiring diagram that was scanned (I think by Ron Van Ness, thank you so much Ron!) to PDF format for printing. If anyone wants it, let me know, or I could put it online. I think it's about 8 megs.

However, the diagram makes no mention of the relay that is connected on my early BN4. Also, the diagram and the wiring on mine (including the numbered terminal block) aren't jiving.

Does anyone know of or have a different wiring diagram than the one posted? Has anyone else come across this discrepancy (sp?) between their heater and the manual?

Also, Ron's notes make note of the relay, so I know I'm not the only one.

I'm pretty good at electrics/electronics so I should be able to get around this but it would be easier with a correct diagram if one is available.

Also, Volks! (Volkswagen Owners and Lovers Klub of Southwestern Ontario) is planning a camp out for the May 15 weekend. Details to be posted soon on our website http://www.sentex_dot_net/~yvan/volks! Room is limited so if you're interested let me know.
