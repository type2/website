&gt;I have to question that statement. The stock oil pressure switch opens at
&gt;2.1-6.4 psi. how much lower can you get? Most non-stock switches come on at
&gt;higher pressures, for example a VDO dual sender (idiot light and electric
&gt;pressure gauge) lights the light at 11 psi.

Just to throw my two cents in, my VDO dual sender (that has been in my bus for... let's see, 14 years and 140,000 miles) lights up at about 8psi as indicated on the gauge.  It lights up at idle occasionally and has ever since I installed it.  The usual scenario for light-on at idle is after a long road trip, after the engine has had a chance to get good and head-soaked. Know that the &quot;engine temperature&quot; does not have to be that high for the oil temperature to be high.  The dipstick can still feel cool even with very hot oil temps.  The oil in your type2 does not change temperature rapidly.  If you have been pushing it on the freeway for 60 miles, you might consider driving your bus around the block a few times to cool the oil before you shut it off.  Best bet is to install an oil temperature gauge so you really know what your oil temp is, instead of relying on the light.
