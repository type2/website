A person I know is retiring from the Air Force and moving from Calif to Pa.  He has three vehicles: one superb 911 Porsche; one 1963 ragtop bug and one 1968 Crew Cab.  All are in showroom condition; unfortunately he had to choose which two to keep and the Crew Cab lost out!

Here are the particulars:
1. Its blue; being chromatically challenged I can't comment on the shade/tone - however, it is a shiny blue seems to be a dark hue
2. 1940cc engine; date of rebuild unknown to me; single Del 40 w/DP; Balanced and Blueprinted;; stock cam and crank (he wanted low end torque?); 009 Dist.; custom dual exhaust (appears to be very high quality)
3. he has owned for 14 years; he is the second owner; all books/manuals and records; This is a DAILY DRIVER!!!!
4. Recaro seats; walkthrough
5. Porsche 356 15&quot; wheels
6. Air conditioned! (he said it has &quot;dual air conditioners&quot;?)
7. Cruise control
8. Etc..........

I drool over this vehicle every time I see it.  Wish my AF job paid me more; can't afford it.  However he (and I) would like it to go to a &quot;good home&quot;.

Anyone interested?

If so, please contact: www.showroomcars_dot_com
He is listing this in the Dupont Registry (GASP!) and went through this Showroom place to ease the pain of selling.

He is asking $15,000 but mentioned he will take less.

Please don't contact me, you now know everything I do about this vehicle.

Mark
