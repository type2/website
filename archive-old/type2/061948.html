Subject: Brakes Bleeding Plan B

Well, I will finally have another person with a foot
at my place this weekend, so I can try again to bleed the
brakes.

My plan is this:

If I get around to the last wheel, and there is still
air as before, I will then remove the master
cylinder, fully immerse it in brake fluid, plunge
the air out of it and try again.

My question is whether I should go ahead and do that first?


I do not have a Plan C, because I will be thouroughly out of
ideas at that point.  I will need a profe$$ional...
