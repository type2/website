Hi Lauria,
    I just saw your post to type2 list looking for a childs cot for your 71 
westy.  I just recently bought an upper cot from Karl von Salzen (spelling?) 
who is also a list member in CA.  At the time he had a number of camper 
items, I think child's cot too.
Only problem is I accidentally deleted his p-mail address from my computer.  
So Karl if you are listening ........
