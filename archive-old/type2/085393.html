Subject: Re: [T2] The perfect VW house! (f)

Wasn't it the Lustron Corp that was given the Tucker plant from under their
feet?  I believe the government owned the factory and when Tucker made too
many enemies around Detroit, the government with pressure from certain
Senators pulled the lease contract away from Tucker and gave it to Lustron.

The Tucker was a rear wheeled drive, rear engined air cooled car that had
features on it in the late 40's that most cars didn't have until the 70's!!
Fuel injection, disk brakes, padded dash, safety glass windshields, seat
belts to name a few.

&gt; Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; On something of a side issure, I invite your attention to the  following
&gt; story that appeared in last Saturday's Washington Post:
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.washingtonpost_dot_com/wp-dyn/articles/A53197-2002Feb22.html
&gt; 
&gt; Is this not *the* house for the VW owner?  They are all steel and a bit
&gt; too small :-)  I am seriously going to pursue buying one!  I have a lot
&gt; nearby with a very restricted building area and I have spent enough time
&gt; living in my VW tin can that I can easily imagine living in a tin can w/o
&gt; the wheels!  And imagine a Dove Blue VW out in front of one of these pale
&gt; blue enameled steel houses!
