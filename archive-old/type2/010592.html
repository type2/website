Thats what i was thinking till i snapped a couple exhaust studs.

I pulled the heads wanting to just replace the studs.

Well, when i cleaned the heads and i found that one was cracked and saw that
one of the head gaskets had failed and marred the deck surface, i needed a
head. Thanks to Seth Avant in TX for the head. 

My buddy says &quot;why don't you hone and replace rings while you're in there?

So, I pull the cylinders and find a broken ring 'land' between the 2nd comp
ring and the oil ring on piston #2.  Needa piston. Thanks to Mac-n-Sons Bug
shop in Lexington, Ky for the odd, dome-top, unmarked 93mm piston we found in
a pile of pistons in the back of the shop -the only one and practically brand
new!

Buddy says: &quot;You're in that far, put rod bearings in it - you'll regret it if
you don't...&quot;  so i put rod bearings in and find (just last night!)that the #2
rod had been installed upside-down on the last rebuild which broke that piston
and bent the rod.  I have a good rod from another 1800 i'm gonna use, so thats
all good.

Both the front and rear oil seals were hard and crackly, so they got
replaced.

This engine was running 'fine' (no rattles,  good power, no smoke...)when i
decided to pull the heads that day back in... what was it? July?  August? 
Man.

Moral:  I'm glad i decided to do what other people advised. I never would have
found these problems and the engine would have committed 'VW hari-kari' if i
hadn't torn it down.
If you look around, 900 bux will definitely buy you a quality rebuild, but
might not pay the labor. Do it yourself.
