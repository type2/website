Hi, I have been looking at the address on the official Volkswagen homepage
in Germany and the address I gave is the correct one.
The b in the address Dieselstrabe is in fact a German character ﬂ but can be
also written as ss, So Dieselstrasse is right.

The Capitol D in front of the postal code is an extra -not necessary- code
for postal services too, clarifying that it has to go to Deutschland
(Germany). Every European country has this optional extra code available for
international use. It is not necessary to put it in the postal code, but it
wont do any harm. (i.e. Holland has NL, Belgium has B, France has F and
Germany has D).

But there is only a difference in the postal code so if you send it to the
wrong postal code it will arrive too.

Talking about all the money you have to send, it sounded to me like you have
to bribe them with enough money or they wont send you a birth certificate.
But the certificate just has a price tag of DM20,--. Or the equivalent in
other currency like US $. So if the equivalent is near $10,--, you just have
to send that amount together with a short but kind letter asking for the
birth certificate and stating your VIN number. If you want to send an extra
amount of money it will be gladly accepted and used for the Volkswagen
Museum. So it isn't too bad to send more cash, but not necessary.

In the past you could ask them via email for your birth certificate, but
they dropped this service. So don't bother asking them thru email, just use
snailmail as suggested here by other people.

I haven't heard anyone before about lost or fragile fiches. This might be
the case. but if they have your money that you send, and that does not mean
an extra amount of money i think, but the asked amount of US $10,--, they
will look better and will scan the fragile fiche for your information. All
the people that I know of who have asked for the birth certificate did
receive the desired thing.
