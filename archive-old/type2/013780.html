&gt; I had a similar problem with my '71 1600DP and isolated the carb as the 
&gt; problem.  Cleaning it won't help
&gt; if the problem is a vacuum/fuel leak that only manifests itself after 
&gt; the engine is warmed up.  You might
&gt; try to borrow a carb from someone to confirm that the carb is the 
&gt; problem, then you can let the owners
&gt; know what it will take to fix it (and how much it'll cost).  That way 
&gt; you'll be &quot;sure&quot; instead of charging them
&gt; extra $$$ for what you think is a solution.

I should note here that the first step in troubleshooting your carbs 
should probably involve
making sure they're tuned properly.  I say this because, as I mentioned, 
while your loss of power
seems like a vacuum leak that manifests itself after the engine warms up 
a bit -- possibly around
the the throttle shaft -- it could also be the result of something silly 
like your idle adjust screw being
screwed out too far and sucking air.  For example, if you can turn your 
idle adjust screw (I'm assuming
the carbs you have on there have an idle adjust screw) in and not see a 
difference in the
idle speed, then you know you either:
	a) have it turned too far out,
	b) have a vacuum leak somewhere, or,
	c) have the mixture set too rich  (I think)

and have to adjust everything appropriately.  Since I know next to 
nothing about dual carbs, I assume
that you have to make sure they (the screws) are set at the same point 
to begin with, and then work
from there by turning each one a quarter of a turn and seeing if the 
idle changed...but I'm sure someone
else knows how do to this if you don't yourself.

I only mention this because I just realized the other day that my idle 
adjust screw was out too far, was
sucking air, and that turning it in didn't effect the idle because it 
was all of the way open.

YMMV,
