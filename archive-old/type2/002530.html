Subject: Re: [T2] brake bleeder

[...]

&gt;   I took the bleeders all the way out amd still nothing. &gt;The wheels spin free
with no pressure in the brake &gt;pedal.The brakes hold with pressure on them. I
&gt;believe it's in the caliper that it's blocked. Can I
&gt;clear out that channel?

I am a little confused here...... you should have zero pressure with the pedal
released.

What problem do you have?

What are you trying to fix?
