Yes

CA = 1600 68-71
CE = 1600 72-75
CU = 1600 76-79

All 3 tranny codes above had the same final drive ratio, even though the R&amp;P
part numbers are different.

The final drives were different on:
CK = 1700 72-74
CM = 1800 73-75
CP = 2000 76-79

Some of the actual gearing was the same depending on the tranny code, so the
difference looks (according to the microfiche) to be in the final drive.
