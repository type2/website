Subject: New Front Axle Beam - One Left!

&gt; &gt; I went to Ron's website to see the 'specials' he's got
&gt; &gt; going right now, and I see the sliders are gone. Did
&gt; &gt; Ron announce this, and if he did, did any of you guys
&gt; &gt; grab extras?

&gt; Unfortunately, many of the specials that I find are a
&gt; &quot;get-em-while-you-can&quot; proposition.


Speaking of which, I was told today that VW no longer has any new front axle
beams to ship. I was also advised not to take backorders, which would seem
to imply that this may be a permanent deletion.  Now you know as much as I
do.

I have just one left at this point. Consider yourself warned. :-(
