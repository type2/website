X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Hello all,
  I was wanting to know what the difference is between the Bus engine and
the Vanagon engine is. (I am talking type 4 Aircooled only) I know that the
case has a different breather set-up on top of the case, but what else is
different? I know they all have hyd lifters, they are all FI, but are the
heads the same? What about the crank, rods, pistons? I bet they are the
same. I dont care about any of the external stuff like FI, intake manifolds,
etc. Just the long block. Basicly could I get a good Vanagon engine and
stuff all the guts into a good Bus case? Or could I drop a Vanagon
engine(use carb and Bus exhaust) into a Bus?
