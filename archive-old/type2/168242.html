Subject: Missiles and guns failed - switching to banging with head...

After getting out my steering pin with a certain amount of ease, Duroc and I
prceeded to try everything imaginable to get out the bushings to no avail.

I have been spraying it with B'laster over and over in hopes of getting the
rust in their to loosen up, but after 3 days of spraying and pounding, I
still cannot get these fu*^ers to budge.

I took a 18mm bit that just about matched the diameter of the lower bushing
to a tee and then banged it with a 4lbs. sledge - nothing.

Went to Home Depot and created a tool using a 5/8&quot; all-thread a series of
washers and nuts. This thing looks like it is strong enough to pull a hummer
through a Cheerio, yet by bushings are just laughing at me as the washers
bent and the bushings stayed right where they were.

I still have enough B'laster to keep dousing it, but I figure that if I have
ZILCH after 3 days, I need to start looking at something else.

Any ideas? Maybe try that Freeze rust breaker stuff?

I am so close to finishing this it's killing me, but I need to get these
damn bushings out!
