Subject: Quaife Differential for the 091?

List:

I recently had an interesting conversation with Chris at Weddle Industries
(used to be Weddle Engineering).  To get &quot;more and better&quot; traction out
of the 091 transaxle you can buy an OEM ZF limited slip unit or the Lock
Right from Weddle.  The ZFs are all used over here (rumor is that there 
are some NOS in Germany)and cost about $900+.  The Lock Rights fully
lock/unlock and clik-clack pretty loudly, especially when new (ask me 
how I know).  They do provide good traction for under $300 (for the part).
Weddle now handles the the Quaife ATB Differentials (Automatic Torque
Biasing) which are, in some folks minds, the ultimate in traction and
are quiet and long-lasting.  The ZF clutch packs need tending in under
50k frequently.  If a batch were made to fit the 091, they would cost
about $1100, in part due to the small manufacturing lot of at least 25
units.  If these were to become available I would want one and be willing
to take the $$ plunge for it.  These units are amazing in the snow and
would be a &quot;poor man's Synchro&quot; of sorts.  The Weddles are polling some
of their customers and I'm wondering if any on this and the Vanagon list
might want one?? If so, please p-mail me and I'll forward a &quot;head count&quot; 
(no names, unless you want to be updated by Weddle directly). I have no
relationship with Weddle other than that of a satisfied customer.  They
are very fussy, quality-oriented rebuilders IMHO and are probably the only
folks with the manufacturing &quot;connections&quot; to get a batch of these done.
Please let me know and I'll report back a summary to the list--if there is
one!  Meanwhile, I'm still on the trail of those NOS ZFs in Germany...
