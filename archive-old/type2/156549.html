 Please verify that it does not emit black smoke when
shaking. If it does, it's rich and can be a couple
things. If it doesn't then Don's reply is likely - a
vacuum leak.

When checking for vacuum leaks - be aware that the
hoses are old and brittle and commonly get dislodged
by hitting a bump hard like a railroad crossing.
Usually one of the big hoses comes loose from the &quot;S&quot;
hose but just hangs there, looking like it's still
snugly attached. Take hold of each and every vacuum
hose in fact, every hose that doesn't have a clamp on
it, and physically confirm that it is plugged into
where it's supposed to. There are a couple just ahead
of the crankcase breather that get buried and they
need checking also. Those particular hoses have a
tendency to crumble from heat/age. If a vacuum leak,
it's a small one.

If black smoke - CHT sensor just ahead of #3 injector
should have about 2400 ohms resistance at somewhere
around 70 degrees. Just unplug the wire (Carefully!)
and test lead attaches to wire, other to ground.
If you have 2300 - 2500, you're okay. Outside of that,
if it has more resistance, it's the likely cause.

Did this come on gradually? -BaH
