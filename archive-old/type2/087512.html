Subject: Re: [T2] one for a very, very slow day

its not that they are tight - they provide a strong squirt up and over the
roof if i wanted. seems like more in the switch. i lubriplated the water
button that sticks into the switch yet i get a trickle outside with the
slightest air pressure in the bottle res...after i push the button it never
100% fully releases. or something.  most of the washer questions have to do
with leaking inside. this is outside.

&gt;If the lines are tight, then my guess would be the jets are clogged.  Use a
&gt;needle(sewing) to clean them out, and try blowing through them to see if
&gt;they flow freely.  They become blocked from mineral deposits(depending on
&gt;local water hardness) and chemical additives.

&gt;&gt;windshield wiper water, why not! changed out my whole switch ont the 68 and
&gt;&gt;it still leaks at both spray nozzles even with slightest air pressure in
&gt;&gt;the reservoir. they are drippin into my doggity gone vent.  what giveth,
&gt;&gt;could i missing a sping?   - steve
