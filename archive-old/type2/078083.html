Subject: Re: [T2] Re: heater box-exhaust header options

J tubes for type 4 s do exist but are as expensive as a pair of heater boxes from ron.  i had some , just sold them in fact someone offered me enough to by new heater boxes even in their used condition! So in my oppinion you are better off just getting a new pair of boxes and having heat.

&gt; You're talking about J-Tubes, here, I think.  I've seen them for Type I engines, but not for Type IV. They probably exist somewhere, though.
