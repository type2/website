Subject: Re: [T2] PC in Bus

&gt;Hi Don,,
&gt;
&gt;A 15&quot; LCD may draw less power, but there is no way that it is cheaper than 
&gt;a 13&quot; color TV Set. I picked up a 13&quot; TV at Walmart last fall for $89 CDN. 
&gt;I have yet to see a new LCD monitor sell for less than $400 CDN.

I got my 15&quot; tft for $150 Canadian.. just have to keep your eyes open
for the deals.  With my tinted windows it's great.. curtains work too.
I personally don't care about a tv tuner.. divx movies and dvd are a more
sure way of providing entertainment than searching for channels in weird
places.

Power and money.. the few hog it too much :)

&gt;
&gt;Another factor to consider is visibility. LCD's have improved immensely in 
&gt;the past few years, but even the newest models can still be very difficult 
&gt;to view in direct sunlight. And that $89 television includes a tuner and a 
&gt;speaker, features that are not typically built in to most LCD displays.
&gt;
&gt;Being concerned about power consumption is EXACTLY why you should be 
&gt;looking at a laptop for your bus. Get a PC-Card or USB TV tuner and you've 
&gt;got the best of both worlds.
