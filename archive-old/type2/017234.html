I didn't see the original post, but there is also a spring clip retainer
(for lack of a better description) that is on the end of the distributor
shaft.  Mine fell off when I removed my distributor for the first time.  I
had to get a magnet on a stick to retrieve it from the distributor void.
Installation without it installed properly made quite and interesting and
loud clicking sound.  Luckily it wasn't damaged.  Maybe someone can
enlighten me as to this parts name and function.

&gt;       As long as the distributor *gear* was installed correctly, there
&gt; is no way the dizzy itself can be installed wrong. It is possible,
&gt; however, that the gear might be off a tooth or so.
&gt;       Another thing to check is whether the fan hub (this is a T4
&gt; engine, right?) key is not broken. If the fan hub moves on the end of
&gt; the crankshaft, you can time it all day long with a timing light or
&gt; static and the timing will show &quot;correct&quot; but won't be -- I burnt my
&gt; heads last year because of this.
