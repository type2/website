Subject: Sightings of &quot;Bay windows&quot;

Ladies and Gentlemen of this site,  if you want to see &quot;lotsa&quot; Bays, go to
Victoria, B.C. Canada.  I love driving down there and &quot;touring&quot;, and to see
sooooo many bays, gives me &quot;brand confidence&quot;, or there were some smart people
before the &quot;van&quot; people started
Chiao!
