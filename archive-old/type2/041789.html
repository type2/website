Subject: VW Euro 2000

In just 3 months it will be the time of the year again for VW Euro. The
premier air-cooled VW event in Europe. Lots of buses (splits and bays) will
be seen there.

We have produced a high quality full colour poster (50 x 70 cm / 20 x 28
inch) printed on extra heavy paper. This will become a collectors item!

You can see a copy of it on:

or (somewhat smaller) on:
http://www.hrps_dot_demon.nl/jwbus/images/vwe-poster.jpg

I have a limited number of copies availiable for interested parties (press /
clubs etc).
If you'd like to get one send me your snail mail address. I don't have
enough to send every listmember a copy to hang on their walls in bedrooms,
workshops or garages so please explain what you'd want to do with it. The
person with the lamest story will also get one !
