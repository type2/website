Subject: Re: [T2] Type4 distributor question:


&gt; The distributor rotor shaft turns around by hand. In fact, it lightly &gt;
&quot;snaps&quot; into &quot;place&quot; every 180 degrees. This does not happen with my T1
&gt; motor's distributor - the shaft only turns when the starter turns it.
&gt;
&gt; Is this normal, and if not, what is wrong?? bad Dist? broken cam?
&gt; stripped distributor gear???

The clamp is loose and the distributor has raised up out of the drive. Loosen
the clamp and lift out the dist. Look down the hole and you will see the
offset in the top of the drive. Look at the bottom of the dist. You will see
the offset of the drive dog. Put the dizzy back in with the offset to match.
Hold it down [you have to push against the spring] and tighten the clamp.
Start the engine and set timing at 7.5 before.
