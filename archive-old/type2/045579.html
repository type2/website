John Connolly sends:

&gt; I would be interested to see how you use this while driving the car. The
&gt; Colortune can only help you set idle mixture (which you can do by ear
&gt; anyways).

Another point against using these with aircooled VWs: How are you going to
see it? It's a special spark plug, right? The plugs on aircooled VWs are
shrouded by the boot and seal at the end of the plug wire.
