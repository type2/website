Subject: Need source for 96mm NPR rings
Mime-Version: 1.0

Need a set of rings for a low mile set of old NPR big bores I'm
about to purchase, anyone got a clue of a source cheaper than
automotion ($60)?  The old ones are fine but I just don't have
luck getting rings to reseat well even when I hone up the barrels
on a lather so if I can get em cheaper I want to.

Oh 2.0 size, there are going into the '82, it's just too darn slow.

John
