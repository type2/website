Subject: BulliKartei

BulliKartei is a VW Bus club located in Germany,and puts out monthly
newsletter and a great color newsletter, BulliExpress, during the year--
If you have been following the destruction going on in Afghanistan, it was
noted that the taliban blew up two very large Buddha Statues--they were
built some 17 Centuries ago--

To give you an idea as to the size of these Statues, The BulliExpress
has a photo of the Buddha Statue with a splittie underneath--The splittie
bus is 1/2&quot; tall, the Buddha is over 12&quot; tall--

Have a VWonderful and Vantastic Ne\X/ Year
