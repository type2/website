Subject: Common topic: Rust

Hey, I know this is a very common/general topic, but
what is the cheapest/easiest way to fix rust in your
opinion.  I've heard that surf board repair works
well.  So far that's what I'm probably gonna end up
doing.  Also, I need to learn how to weld.  What is
the easiest method of welding and where can I learn to
do it.  Any help you can offer would be great.
