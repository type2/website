Subject: Volkswagen Books

All you literate Volkswagen folks:

I have had three requests for specific books to be available at the
Volkswagen Bookstore webpage. All three are now available.
I will be adding more later-bus books and non-aircooled (gasp!)
books a few at a time.

If anyone has any book even remotely associated with VW's let me know
and I will find it and make it available.

Check it out!

ALL PROCEEDS GO TO A SMALL LOCAL VW CLUB. All books between 10-30% off
list price. 

(we got permission today to hold our event on Oregon State University
property. Swap and show. Date TBA!)
