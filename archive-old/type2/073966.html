Subject: Oil leak - oil pickup bolt

------_=_NextPart_001_01C15BCB.E49E41B0
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hi all,
When I was putting my Type IV together, the securing bolt for the oil pickup
did not seem to tighten properly, as if it was partially stripped.  I
figured I could get away with it (didn't feel like taking the case halves
apart to re-tap - probably a mistake) and finished re-assembly.  The engine
is now in my bus, and since adding oil to it, a significant leak has
developed at that bolt.  I have tried tightening it but it still leaks.  I
have not run the engine yet (it turns but won't start, and I have to
diagnose that).  Other than taking the engine down and completely
disassembling to fix the threads, is there anything I can do to minimize or
eliminate the leak, with the engine in place?  I'll take it down and apart
if I have to, but I'd REALLY like to avoid that, as you can imagine.
Thanks for your thoughts.
  --Robert
