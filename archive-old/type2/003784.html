&gt;   I've finally found a working window wind mechanism in a junked bus to
&gt; replace the current arrangement manufactured by Wooden Peg &amp; Duct-tape


I have these, brand new N.O.S. Volkswagen dealer stock, for $29.95.  One of
the items I brought back from Europe.  Drivers side only (passenger side is
$10 more and Mexican).
