Subject: voltage regulator part#?

Hello,

I have a couple of questions regarding voltage
regulators. What is the part# for the voltage
regulator used with the 70amp alternators that VW
installed in some buses? Busdepot gives 2 part numbers
for bus regulators. They are:

30051

30048-supressed

Is one of these made for the high output alternator?
Will either work? What does it mean when the 30048
model is described as supressed?

Thanks in advanced for any replies!

Take care!

David Kelly
