You could come down and watch my son, go to work and deal with all of the xmas
shight while *I* go out and work on the bus for a few days! ;p

Isn't it a shame you can't just give time (or youth!) itself as a gift? Thats
all we really want anyway.

Happy Holidays,

Clark in Ky.

&gt; 
&gt; I have both a wire feed and TIG welder
&gt; need some attention from me.  Drop
&gt; me some mail if your interested...

&gt; something to do)
&gt; 
&gt; take care all-
