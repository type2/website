Subject: Rebuilt Brake Booster

Hi All,

I brought a rebuilt brake servo, ripped the old one
out, but they are not identiacl...

The old (original?) one has a plastic sleeve with a T
on ther front, which was attached to the hose that
supplies the clean air (from the cab?).

The rebuild didn't come with the T-sleeve , but has a
different front boot with a built-in air filter.  The
old T-sleeve can be attached to the rebuild in it's
original position, but it doesn't look like it would
do anything due to the new boot not reaching the
sleeve to form a seal. It looks like the rebuild just
get's it's air from under the bus, instead of from the
hose.

Anybody noticed this before? I'm guessing I don't need
the T-sleeve? 

TIA
