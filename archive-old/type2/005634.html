I have seen a posting which stated that if you pack your boot too heavily
with grease it will pop soon.  Who knows about this factor?

&gt; I've had good luck with Rockford boots.  Two years and no visible
&gt; cracking.  Much better than the Lobro and Qualitat boots I tried
&gt; previously.
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; One caution:  the rockford boots are a modern design, without the
&gt; accordian convolutions of the originals.  The axle end of the boot should
&gt; be placed outboard (toward the CV) of the locating &quot;lumps&quot; on the axle,
&gt; instead of between the lumps.
&gt; Otherwise you will stretch the rubber too much at full extension of the
&gt; suspension.
&gt;
&gt; And, of course, YMMV!

I
&gt; &gt; myself changed mine then using German replacements.  Well as you might
guess
&gt; &gt; they are already ripped.  Did any one find a company that sells
replacement
&gt; &gt; boots that actually survive over a year???  It isn't a hard job but a
very
&gt; &gt; nasty one I would rather not do more than once a year.
