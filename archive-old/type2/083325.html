Subject: No hits on the 009 - so how about...

Don't worry David, you wouldn't offend me.

It was a &lt;F&gt;riday joke. Some folks got it, some folks didn't. I thought that 
after the 4.8MB of &quot;009 Bashing&quot; bandwidth last week, more people would have 
seen the absolute genius of that humor. Or, maybe I'm just an idiot. 
However, be that as it may...

The junkyard dogs smiled upon me yesterday, and I have a spare Westy fridge 
tray (not the ice tray - the grill above that the block of ice actually sits 
on) for free to good owner. In great condition. Prefer a local who can pick 
it up - I hate shipping things. If no locals are interested, first non-local 
pmail can pay shipping, and I'll (sigh..) ship it.

Los Angeles area, specifically, Burbank (work), and more specifically, 
Tujunga (home).

Mike &amp; Itch (who runs so much better now that he has an SVDA from 
aircooled_dot_net, instead of an 009 hooked up to his 34-PICT-3)

Not to down play or tarnish the price Mike has put on
his 009 but I sold the one that was on my bus for$0.75
at Everybus. It was in working condition.

Have a good day!
David Kelly

P.S.- I don't think that asking Mike if he would take
$0.75 for his 009 would be considered a &quot;serious
inquiry&quot;, so don't use my price as an example!! ;o)

Cheers!
