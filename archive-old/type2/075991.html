Subject: Re: [T2] Rear Stub Axle Questions

Volks,

Last week I asked if anyone had any trick for removing the big C-clip that
retains the inner bearing on a Vanagon rear bearing carrier.  I got a
number of suggestions, one of which was to us a pair of needle-nosed
pliers ground to fit.  Well, I finally got back to it this afternoon and
tried that second off (right after I broke a tip off the Sears C-ring
clamp remover)  I got out all my needle nosed pliers and laid 'em out.
The first pair I tried, the noses were too big, as were the second
(vise-grip needle nose).  The third pair was an unlikely one... a
leatherman tool... fit like a glove, the ring is out!  Came easily in &lt;5
seconds!

First, there are few emergency tools as useful as a leatherman.  It ain't
ideal for anything, but like duct tape and WD-40, it's damn useful!

Second, that ring is too big for any C-ring puller that is sold in a
FLAPS.  The little removable-tip jobbers are fine for wrist pins, but this
job is too big for them, sorry.  I got a Craftsman because now I get a
second set of tips and I can go back to using them as inteneded.  Snap-on,
Mac and the rest probably sell a mongo-sized ring-puller for this sized
ring, but I can't justify buying it for my once-a-decade use.

Third, my thanks to whoever suggested the needle-nose pliers!  You know
who you are!  (but I don't, because I accidentally deleted your post :-(
Step up and take a bow!

Now... to punch that bearing out and see whether the failure was limited
to the outer bearing (I think it was) or extended to the inner as well...
