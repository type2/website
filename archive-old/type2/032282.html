Hey Hey, welcome to type 2 heaven.  

If you haven't been there yet, go to www.type2_dot_com (the companion web site
to this listserv).  There is a wealth of information there, including
searchable archives of this list.

&gt; 1.  What size engine originally came in the 71 Type 2?  From what I can tell, 
&gt; I guess it was a 1500 or 1600cc.  Does anyone know what it's horsepower 
&gt; rating is?  Max speed, etc.

	1600 Dual Port upright (type I) {that is I'm pretty sure}

&gt; 
&gt; 2.  If I wanted a more powerful engine, what would be the most logical 
&gt; choice?  Would all the bus parts still interchange with it?  (I know, I 
&gt; know...it's a bus, not a race car...but I'd still like it to have some punch 
&gt; to it.  Nothin wrong with that, is there?)

	Ahh...Pandora's Box.  Open Wide. Tons of info on that one.
	Most people on this list seem to like stock,  but the
	archives are full of this subject.

&gt; 3.  The bus is missing just about every piece of interior trim...  It's naked 
&gt; inside.  Can anyone give me a brief description of what's supposed to be 
&gt; there?  Where can I get this stuff?  I guess a junkyard would be my best bet. 
&gt;  Just wondering if anyone knew of anyplace that specialized in interior 
&gt; pieces for the bus.  There must be SOMEONE.

	Again, on type2_dot_com, the Library section has an interior page
	that has pictures (at least it did a couple of years ago when
	I was working on my 74 loaf.

&gt; 
&gt; 4.  My wife has no clue how to drive a manual.  Of course, she'll learn.  I 
&gt; heard a rumor someplace that doesn't SEEM very likely to me, so maybe this 
&gt; would be the best place to ask it.  A very unreliable source told me that VW 
&gt; had also made automatic transaxles?  I'm not sure how true this rumor is, but 
&gt; I've personally never seen one in magazines or catalogs.  Can anyone shed 
&gt; some light on this for me?
&gt; 
	Yes, it did exist.  I don't know about for the '71 though.
	I know the later models had it available.


Welcome to the list.  You're hooked.
