Subject: blocked airhose for fuel tank?
Message-ID: &lt;19990520174437.13196.rocketmail_at_web601.yahoomail_dot_com&gt;

Hello again,
I have a bit of a situation.  Yesterday I thought I remedied a gas leak
on my '78 bus.  One of the yellow airhoses coming out of the top was
disconnected.  I hooked it back up but then when I went to crank it up
the engine stalled out and kept cutting out.  I then thought the
previous owner must of undone the airhose because it was blocked.  I'm
going to try to replace the hoses.  Are there any other possibilities
for this.  It ran fine before I connected the hose and when I
disconnected to see if would run again it didn't improved the matter. 
Any advice??
Thanks,
Tim Pries
