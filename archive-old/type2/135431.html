Subject: Prices for a valve job?

Hello all,

My first post to this list, and unfortunately not a happy one! Just
bought an '83 air cooled Westfalia, which was to be my summer
camp-mobile - I stupidly didn't get it inspected before purchase, and
am now stuck with an engine with 0 compression in one of the
cylinders.

The local shop (Fred's in Redwood City, CA) quoted ~$1900 for a valve
job. I've heard only good things about them, so it's probably a fair
price, but I've learned my lesson and will check everything before
jumping in! Is this price standard?

I'm not exceptionally mechanically able, but I can find my way around
a motorcycle engine, and I learn things quickly if it means saving
thousands of dollars. Is it possible to take the heads off myself and
have the work done for far less dollars? In perusing the type2
archives, I saw some talk of getting new valves in and lapped and
reground and all for ~400, but this may be a different beast or way
out of date.

Finally, would I be better off looking for another engine and swapping
out? Or does anybody want to buy my van?!!

Thanks for any and all assistance with this. I'm hoping to get out of
this crappy situation with as little damage to my wallet as possible -
I certainly wasn't anticipating these costs right off the bat. The
engine was supposedly replaced with a GEX rebuild 15,000 miles ago.

Cheers!
