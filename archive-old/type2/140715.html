&gt; i went today and picked up the parts but got a couple other things as well...
i got part number 211711182(front bushing) and part number 211711179 also suggested by karl.....

* umm no, I said the shuttle cock replacement part does not fit.
Here is what I wrote, right from what you quoted:
&quot;I found that the replacement center shaft shuttle cock
bushings don't fit and are worthless. Probably nothing
wrong with yours.
http://www.busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=211711179&quot;

211 711 179 is the rear shuttle cock bushing. It is # 16 here:

&gt; he also sold me part number 211711185 B which says for a 62-67 but his book also said for my year 76 as 
&gt; well....
and then i got the rear coupler 311798211 whcih needs much attention once solving the shifter problem....?

* I have no clue as to what this part is, 211711185 B
ETKA says it is a deleted part and there is no substitute for it.
So I looked in my 68-71 parts book and it is the front shuttle cock. # 13 in the above pic.

&gt; taking the shifter apart i havent noticed anything out of the ordinary but will be crawling under tomorrow 
&gt; to inspect omn where exactly the front bushing and others goes hopefully...

&gt; if i overlooked it somewheres.. whcih ones or one of these bushings will i have to take the engine out to 
&gt; install?

&gt; thanks for all the help so far on this project... i wil take puics tomorrow and post them up .....or try 
&gt; to... if everything goes as planned.....
hopefully of my findings...?

&gt; ohh and karl....

&gt; to make sure i am understanding you correctly...? the shift coupling at the nose of transaxle...
the rear coupler right....? you weld it to the shift rod? does this elimate having to use the wire method 
tieing to screw? am i reading you right? just making sure before i go diging in...

* whoa, no!!!! You need to spot weld the coupling hub to the cage.
OUT of the bus.  BEFORE you put it in.
# 24 is the coupling http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/Microfiche/t205700.gif

See the rectangular stamped steel cage?
See the round hub that is pressed on to it?
Where the hub is pressed over the rectangular flat steel is where it slips.
You tack weld it to stop THOSE two pieces from moving...... and they will!

Here is a post I made back in 2002 on replacing the
front bushing:
