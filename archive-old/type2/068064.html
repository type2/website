Subject: 74 bus w/ factory sunroof FS

There is a 74 bus FS in Maryland.  I went and looked at it.
The bus is in nice shape overall, original white over light tan.
Factory sunroof that works and doesn't leak.
Not much rust at all, and no dents.
Dual carbs, just rebuilt professionally.
New tires.  Needs pushrod tube seals.  $1200 but very negotiable.
