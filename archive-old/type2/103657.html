Subject: Re: [T2] bumper reflective tape

You can get them at any good farm supply store.

Plus, feel free to ignore all the Jailhouse Lawyers on the list who predict
heavy fines and hassles from the police..... It hasn't happened to me and
I've been driving my bus WITH THE ORANGE TRIANGLE in place for several years
now. I think the law says you  MUST display a slow moving vehicle sign
(requirement) if you are going 25 MPH or less ..etc... but I don't think
there is a law PROHIBITING other vehicles from displaying the SMV triangle.

Of course, traffic laws vary from state to state ... but I haven't had any
problems driving in the southern sectors of the United States between
California and the East coast. I'll let the masses argue out the
issue and keep my sign mounted for that real-world test beteween the letter
of the law and what actually gets enforced.  In the meantime, it sure keeps
those Truckers off my tail :-)

&gt; Absolutley correct George--
&gt; An SMV is limited to slow moving Farm, Excavating and Amish horse drawn
&gt; vehicles only--at the rate of speed you mentioned.
&gt; Displaying one of these on any other vehicle at a higher rate of speed
&gt; is not only dangerous, but good for a good sized fine--
stay with the red and white DOT approved tape--&gt;
