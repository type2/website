Hey Brian...


Don't know if you got my earlier post or not, but here goes...

The engine fires in this order:  1-4-3-2, which means that the pulley
wheel is turning clockwise.  Therefore, the second example above is 5 deg.
ATDC.  If you look at your spark plug wires, and you hand crank your
engine clockwise from #1, the next cylinder that is fired is #4.  

So you're engine is actually timed at 5 deg. BTDC.  I don't know if you're
timing statically or with a strobe light, but I would highly recommend
using a static light to time your bus.  I've used both frequently and the
static method is absolutely foolproof.  The strobe light brings other
variables into the equation (like your vacuum advance, etc.).  Let me know
if you don't have one and I'll let you know how to make your own for about
$2.

Cheers,

Tom
