&gt; &gt; 009's only hesitate with 34 pict 3's, in my experience, and that problem
&gt; &gt; can be cured im told as well.  I have a 009 on a 1600dp with a h30/31 pict
&gt; &gt; (bocar) and have no hesitation problem...
&gt; 
&gt; My experience isn't the same.  I run the same setup and it still
&gt; hesitates.  Not as badly as the 34, but the flat spot is there.
&gt; 
&gt; I need to find my timing light so I can play around with the dual vacuum
&gt; distributor I have.  It ran like a dog the last time I tried it (after
&gt; making sure everything worked properly), but I think that the problem was
&gt; more in my tuning than in the distributor.

Try running it as a SVDA (c) distributor.  Only hook up the advance hose,
leave the retard hose open to the atmosphere... time at 7.5 BTDC, see how
that works... (a lot of carbs dont have the proper fitting for the retard
hose anyways..)

take care,

Steve
