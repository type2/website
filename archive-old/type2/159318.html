Subject: Re: [T2] Second battery wiring location

If you must drill no hole:  I've seen the drain plug in the spare tire 
well used to run a wire through- tape over it and run it to the top of 
the well, then down the outside wheel well to under the seat in the rear 
or under the fridge cabinet to behind the sink cabinet and on to 12V 
recepacles you can place in the seatbed wall or rear wall of the sink 
cabinet.  The extra 12v socket with the metal lip (Pep Boys) fits 
perfectly in the hole seen in the control panel for the DeLuxe stove. 
The wire can be run vertically in the corner of the closet to outlets or 
devices in the upper over-bed cabinet- there we have an extra 
radio/cd/mp3 disk player that feeds into its aux input the output from 
the laptop that plays dvd's or from a portable tv monitor.
You can also wire in a 2 way switch as we did, running interior light 
wires, sink pump, outlets for tv/games, and fan either on the spare or 
on the stock battery.  When at a site with electric, just hook up a 10 
amp battery charger across the spare batt. terminals.  The battery will 
act as a capacitor so you should not get interference from the usually 
unfiltered DC of the charger.
