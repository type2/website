&gt; I have seen many requests about the durability of the SS exhausts.  I have
&gt; purchased one for my 73 (pancake engine) and one for my 71 single cab (upright
&gt; engine)  I have had the same failure on both types within 1.5 years.  A part
&gt; in the body of the muffler comes loose causing a very loud exhaust noise.  I
&gt; don't know of any way to find out exactly what's happening short of cuting the
&gt; body of the muffler apart to see what broke, but then it would be useless to
&gt; me as a muffler.

??? is this the SS muffler that Bus Depot sells??  I have put one of those
on my 78 auto tranny bus over 10,000 miles ago and it still seems dern
near brand new on the outside.  who knows what the inside looks like but
it still sounds the same as it did when I first got it..
