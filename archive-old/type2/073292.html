I have thought that a great way for us to display our collective knowledge
is to use the Faq-O-Matic code.

http://www.dartmouth_dot_edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/jonh/faq.pl

This site documents the Faq-O-Matic. The Faq-O-Matic is a CGI-based system
that automates the process of maintaining a FAQ (or Frequently Asked
Questions list). It allows visitors to your FAQ to take part in keeping it
up-to-date. A permission system also makes it useful as a help-desk
application, bug-tracking database, or documentation system.


We would need some one to start it and I am sure that it will snow ball.


Here is a working Faq-O-Matic that collects answers about LINUX on the Mac:

&gt;SERIOUSLY!!!!
&gt;
&gt;That would free-up a LOT of band-width for Type-II. It
&gt;could make this list move more smoothly.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Well...what do you all think?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;This is *SO* easily do-able!
