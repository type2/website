Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Propane conversion

Last year I spotted an orange VW non camper Bus, late 70's or so, sitting
behind a garage with the wheels sunk into the ground. The body looked pretty
good. In the back there was a propane tank, taking up space over the engine
compartment. I found out it was a Dutch family that immigrated with it, and
it was sitting because it wasn't yet 25 years old and it was going to cost
them a fortune to get it registered in Canada.(it didn't have seat belts and
several other issues that I could have dealt with easily) They had a lot of
money in the bus and of course wanted a good dollar for it, but were willing
to sell it to get rid of the headache. I thought about it, but it had a type
4 engine with 2 carbs, converted to propane. I already have my 70 with a
1600 which I prefer, so I gave it a pass. I still have their phone number if
anyone is interested, it is in Southern Ontario. I don't know if they still
have it. It seemed to have been sitting for over a year without starting or
anything, we all know how good that is for a vehicle.
