Subject: Westy FS in Texas...

Hi all;
   Was down at the local DMV this morning, met a guy there who asked if
that was my Bug parked out front. &quot;Yep.&quot; says I. &quot;Would you be
interested in a '79 camper bus/&quot; says he. &quot;Well, not really, caught up
in resto of '78 Westy, but I know some folks who might.&quot;
   He said he's show me the bus and give me some Bug parts if I dropped
by his house. Free parts? I'm there!
   Looked at the bus. Sage green '79 Westy. FI intact. minor rust at the
lower windshield area, otherwise mostly complete. Needs some tin work
around the left side engine area where some DPO had removed the AC
compressor, apparently with a hacksaw. All the rest of the AC stuff is
there. Interior is pretty good, needs some minor touch up, but all the
curtains, beds etc. is there. Upholstery in decent shape, didn't spot
any tears. Doesn't look like anybody ever slept upstairs. Engine fires
up, some valve clatter which I suspect is just the hyd lifters needing
pumping up. It's a Ca. version (catalytic perverter). Aridzona bus
(still has Az plates), no rust to speak of other than the above
mentioned windshield. Poptop seals seem to be in pretty good shape,
still pliable, no cracks. Other seals look to be in fair shape as well.
He's asking $2500.
   Fellow is an older gentleman who just doesn't have the energy to
continue resto. Contact him (not me) by phone at (830)931-2262. His name
is Monty Garrett.
   The bus is located in Castroville, Tx (about a half hour west of San
Antonio).

'78 Westy and too many other VW projects or I'd jump on this puppy (if I
brought another VW home my wife would make me sleep in the bus.)
