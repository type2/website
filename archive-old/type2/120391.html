Subject: Please repost the Wells part no for the VR

Hi guys, at work here I usually skim messages quickly, and accidentally deleted the part no. for the Wells Solid State VR no. Could someone repost it please? I'm assuming this will work with a generator as well, like the ones in my 12volt bugs??
Thanks,
Courtney
