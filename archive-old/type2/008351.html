Subject: 71 Westy bodywork -( longish)

My daughter's loaf just got smashed.  It's really too sad, after all she
has had to do to get it on the road.  There were the usual emissions
things, the wiring, the lights, etc.  Finally, 2 months after she bought
it she was legal and loving her Westy.  What a neat first vehicle for a
19 year old kid!

She was driving in Fairfax, VA on one of the major roads, trying to make
a left hand turn across traffic.  The bus stalled and didn't make it
across before being smacked in the right rear corner.  Smashed the
bumper up, too.  She was pretty broken up about it.

Thanks to fellow list member Brent Jarvi, she already has the
replacement metal and a great bumper to fix the bus.  Thanks again,
Brent.  Now, the problem.  She took the bus to a local body shop for an
estimate.  They told her 800.00 - 1000.00 to fix it, but that they
wouldn't do it.  Maybe because it is a self pay job, instead of an
insurance one, who knows?  They couldn't recommend anyone, either.  

Does anyone know of a shop that is more reasonable and that does this
sort of work?  The bus is drivable, so we could travel a  certain
distance to the right shop.
