Subject: Re: [T2] Untitled bus will need title in TN

Thanks Wes,

I know it'd be masochistic to do anything in CA right now.
I just don't know much about TN DMV, and wasn't sure if they had any draconian
legislation on the matter.
Are you in TN, or somewhere else?

Billy

&gt; Wait till after you've moved to TN and check out
&gt; www.its-titles_dot_com. Worked for me and took about a
&gt; month and a half for the process.
&gt;
