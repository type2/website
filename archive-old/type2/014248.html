Subject: Westfalia Maintenance files

I'm trying to get my Westfalia maintenance files off my old Macintosh II
computer.
The computer was part of my office network and I've lost the boot and
system disks. Anybody out there got a set or copy of the system disk to
help me out of this trap? I'm not sure of the operating system number
since I can't boot it to see the info.
Your assistance would be appreciated, these files are the only reason
I've kept this old computer.
