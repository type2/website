R &amp; S Strauss parking lot...?-) They were amazed that the motor was

Yeah, I pulled in for gas once while driving my bug, asked the kid to check

Obligatory bus content--mine is now parked in the street and won't start.
Mechanic thinks it might be the starter or an ignition wire. I'll find out
this week.
