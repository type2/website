Subject: should I drive my Bus to TX?

I am going on a Buss. trip to Texas. Sheppard AFB to be
exact. I will be there for two weeks starting 24 April. My
question is, how are Busses to travel in long distance? I
have a choice of driving my 74 Bus, or an 84 Mitsubishi 4X4
pickup. The truck needs a clutch and valve adjustment and
the Bus needs work too. I think that a 2200 mile drive in
my truck would be very uncomfortable, the cab is small and
the ride is stiff. I have owned several Busses, but never
drove them out of town. I always take the wifes 98 Caravan
on long trips, but can not do that this time. I need to
know if I should take the Bus so I can spent my money on
fixing it and not the truck, or the other way around. Both
need a clutch, both have good tires, both have bad heaters.
The truck has more power, but I can not sleep in the truck,
I could in the Bus. It is not a camper yet, just a Kombi.
  Of course I will do all of the prevenitive maint. on
either, comp test, plugs, tune-up. etc. 
  So any input would help me decide.
