Subject: Re: Oil Cooler-Aftermarket,  Engine Hesitation   
X-Sun-Charset: US-ASCII

	Martha Rubin (Busgirl) had one of the oil cooler + fan deals on her
eggnog 81 Westie (you read that right- an aircooled westie vanagon... we're
talking VERY highly loaded/underpowered.) She was very satisfied with
it. She also had an oil temp and pressure gauge and an override
switch that allowed her to turn on the fan whenever she decided it
needed to be on. There was also a thermostat switch.

	It was mounted under the bus, flat, under the far back seat,
protected by the lateral and longitudinal beams under the floor, on
the passenger side. I believe this was the bus she drove to Inuvik, so
obviously it handled wild and wooly conditions well. Remember this
was on a Type IV, and no, I don't know if the external cooler
had a thermostat for flow. I expect it was 'in parallel' to the stock
Type IV cooler, rather than a replacement, but I could be wrong.

	VW and other 'air cooled' motors are substantially 
*oil cooled* and the built-in oil-cooler was terrific in the
original 25hp version- Then came 36hp, and more, and the
original design started to show problems. Like the cooler blocking/
preheating #3 head's airflow (hence the distributors retard #3). 
The later 'dog-house' oil-cooler installation, with larger blower fan 
and shroud, and a separate air-flow for the cooler, is a peachy solution 
for a stock engine subjected to occasional heavy loads. 

	The problem all external oil coolers have is that you can't
rigidly connect the cooler and the engine- because the engine free to
vibrate in its rubber mounts (and should be) and the external cooler
is attached to the chassis. So you have to have flex connections, and
being filled with VERY hot oil at high pressure they will not only
flex but balloon some, reducing oil pressure delivered to the crankshaft.
Then again, cooling the oil increases its viscosity- its a trade off.
No free lunch. For Martha's eggnog Westie, the external cooler was
probably the conservative choice. For our pickup truck, the doghouse
on a TypeI/II seems to be good so far.

	How does this relate to valve seats? If you have an original
oil cooler (pre-doghouse) and 1300cc or bigger engine, or pound the
heck out out of your engine, your #3 exhaust will appreciate a switch
to doghouse cooler. Beyond that, oil coolers don't do much for valve seats.
Oil up in valve gear gets there by flowing through the lifters, through
the pushrods, through the rockers and out around the rocker shaft. A bit
sprays around where the pushrod meets the rocker. After that is flows
back down the pushrod tubes to the sump. It doesn't get very close to
the valve seats, and I can't believe it plays much role in cooling them.

	Having all the appropriate air flow 'tin' in place and
in good shape, having your air thermostat vanes in place, and at
the outside painting the head casting flat black are all better steps
for the valve seats than an external cooler. Making sure your engine
tin to engine compartment seals are in good shape, and the
engine hatch seal ditto, are also very good things. You don't want
any hot air getting back into the engine compartment.
	After that you can run your timing on the retarded end of 
acceptable, run higher octane gas and just generally keep an eye on 
things. Put in a head temp gauge and watch it.

	I shouldn't do this but I'll comment on the 009 discussion
anyway. John Muir had a good idea about maintaining your own wheels.
His views on smoking cigarettes and favoring non-detergent oil
are obviously wrong. His sore toe about automatic chokes is part of
his legend, but I don't find his arguments persuasive. My fuel injected
engines have a choke function that richens the mix during startup and
I've gotten 209,000 miles from one, which was still strong when I sold
it. His preference for 009s is simply misinformed, part of the times
he lived in and part of the difficulty VW and all other manufacturers
had meeting smog laws. Vaccuum advance does something no mechanical
advance distributor can ever do- respond to the throttle position
before the engine speed has substantially changed. There's no parallel
between the traditional evils of 60s/70s American land barge cars
and reasonable throttle response. Feathering the clutch during
acceleration (not gear changes) in a daily driver is silly.
	A race car is entirely different and compromises in
drivability for high power are understandable. 

	But at the bottom line, John Muir would laugh himself sick
at someone's admonishion to 'go read John Muir'. John Muir's greatness
came not from his conclusions, which were often wrong, but from his
scientific, individual and responsibe approach- listen to all arguments, 
test all theories and do the work yourself. Learn from your mistakes.
THAT was John Muir's approach, and its a good one. Taking a 30 year old 
book as revealed wisdom that cannot be improved or challenged isn't
worthy of the man.
