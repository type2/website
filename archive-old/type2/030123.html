&gt; &gt; Hello folks - got a MacGyver question for you. I'm interested in using an
&gt; &gt; older LCD screen from a dead laptop computer as a TV monitor in my Westy
&gt; &gt; (or anywhere else I need a screen).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Does anyone know if this possible, and how?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Trying to make do with what I have on hand without searching wrecked Warner
&gt; &gt; Bros. Edition minivans or buying $1500 computer monitors, or breaking into
&gt; &gt; one of the local university buildings. .
&gt; 
&gt; Not without a lot of work.  I was considering the same thing for my Double Cab.
&gt; In fact, last week I had someone at work come and ask me the same
question.  He
&gt; was trying to get around the $$option cost of the in car video system.

Gee, have you heard about the new innovation called &quot;Windows&quot;?  No, not
the one from Micro$oft, but the ones in your bus?  As you drive, the
images in the windows changes in a number of interesting and often
exciting ways!  Many people, including children, have found that
viewing these changing scenes is an interesting way to pass the time
during a trip.

If you drive into the mountains you will see images of trees and sometimes
snow, while going downhill will give you desert vistas and beach scenes!

Video screens in a VW bus?  Sheesh!

George
