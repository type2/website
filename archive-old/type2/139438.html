Subject: Plastigaging the rod oil clearances

This is more for the archives than anything else.

In order to plastigage (plastigauge) the rod oil clearances during a 
rebuild, you have to be able to place the crankshaft in a horizontal 
position and keep it from moving. To do this, Wilson babbles about 
welding a piece of pipe to an old gland nut. If you're building a type 
4, you're sort of out of luck as far as Wilson's concerned.

But if you have an engine stand, you can use two of the brackets to 
bolt the crankshaft through at the flywheel ends. Only two bolts (same 
size as flywheel bolts, but long enough to go into the brackets), 
through non-adjacent threads, with washers to protect the end of the 
shaft. Then raise the end of the stand so that the crankshaft is 
horizontal.
