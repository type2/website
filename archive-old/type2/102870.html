&gt; Update: I installed these in my '71 standard Beetle last fall.  So far, they
&gt; are working fine, in spite of my having removed the &quot;ball bearing
&gt; doohickeys&quot; 'cause they would not work otherwise.

Aren't the &quot;ball bearing doohickeys&quot; the inertia sensors that lock the
reel?  If you take them out, the reels will indeed run in and out but they
won't lock after an accident!

The inertia reels have to be mounted upright to allow the &quot;ball bearing
doohicky&quot; to disengage so the belt will roll out and in.
