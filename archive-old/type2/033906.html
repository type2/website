Subject: Another VW bus friend lost 

Posted with permission from Ken Hooper:

December 14, 1999

One year ago today, the VW bus community lost a another good friend, Josh
Rogers.  During this time of year, I feel it very important to remember
those who are struggling with life's problems so as to keep those problems
from getting out of hand.  Overwhelming problems may be something as simple
as running out of money for your project, or as severe as a change in your
marriage as Josh was facing.  Everyone faces those types of problems, but
at times, it may be too much for some to handle.

During these holidays, while you are doing the last minute shopping, please
try to say some words of assurance to those who are struggling with life.
A few kind words to a person who's heart is heavy may be just what they
need to get them over the hump.

The group of bus enthusiasts Josh started in Ponca City, OK is continuing
to grow, but they will never get over the once energetic and compulsive
leader that got them all started.

For those of you who did not know Josh Rogers, or for those of us who deal
with his lose on a personal basis, I have included what Charlie Ford wrote
about Josh when he got the news last year:


I hadn't checked my mail all day and when Brian came in and informed me of
the news I must say it caught me totally by surprise as I am sure it did
many of you.

I met Josh the first time last year at BBTA.  I was introduced to him by
Ginger Nipps.  She and Josh were standing around talking and I just sort of
strolled into the conversation.  I remember seeing him the first time and
saying, &quot;Man what a little pretty-boy jerk.&quot;

You know how first impressions can be so totally inaccurate?  Well this was
certainly the case.

Josh was as kind as anyone I have ever met.  Even when he disagreed with
you there was never discontent.  He carried himself with dignity and honor,
and that is all any of us can strive for.  I only wish I could have been
there to stop him from doing this terrible thing.

I am glad this man came into my knowing.  He was good, and bad, and had one
heck of a great bus, you can't go wrong with his chosen colors.

I will pray for his family and friends, among them I count myself.

I will miss him, but I will also think of him often.

You were a good man Josh Rodgers!

Charlie Ford
