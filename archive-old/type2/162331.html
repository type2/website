Subject: Re: [T2] 78 Westy won't stay running

Shawn,

Look along the drivers side of the engine close to the frame rail.

You should have two electrical wires....one with a fuse and one without.

Make sure that you have them hooked up correctly.

It is *early* on Sunday morning, so I'm a little fuzzy, but I've had the 
same problem and it was because I missed hooking up one of those 
connections....I think it was from the double relay, so that it keeps the 
fuel pump going after you let go of the key.

Also, check that you have the correct wires on the correct terminals on 
the starter.  Re-read the FI chapter paragraph  in the bentley about the 
wiring to the starter motor again.


Cheers, dave

&gt; Hello list's, I have been fighting this for 2 days. I
&gt; now need help. This is a 78 Westy, 2000cc FI. It was
&gt; running fine with no problems other than a weak
&gt; pressure plate.
&gt; 
&gt; morning I checked everything out to make sure I hooked
&gt; everything up right. Everything appears to be hooked
&gt; up correct. I tried to start it and it would run for a
&gt; second and then die. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;      The bus still will only start for a second. I
&gt; have no more ideas to try. I have to get my westy
&gt; running. Please help.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
