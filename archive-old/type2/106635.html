Subject: RE: [T2] bay tail light gaskets

&gt; As you can see it's neither half the length or full length. 411 941 123 is
the part number.

The part number I'm looking for (73-79) is:
411 845 235.  From what I can find out, it's NLA. If RTV is what everyone's
using, I'll follow suit.  The rope stuff, between the housing and the lens,
is no big deal...you can get something close at the hardware store.
