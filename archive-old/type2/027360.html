Hello,

From looking at the Gene Berg website, I am uncertain if they make
one for a 76 baywindow bus or not.

Is my only pre-manufactured option (I don't think I want to tackle building 
my own, 2 months later I will still be sitting around with the parts and no 
progress) the one where you have to drill something?

Any tips, info, or insults are welcome and looked upon favorably,

Christopher
