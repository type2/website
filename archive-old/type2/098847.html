Subject: Re: [T2] FI conversion questions 

&gt; Steve,
&gt; 
&gt; You asked:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Can I use a stock '74 exhaust with FI?
&gt; 
&gt; Though the exhaust system did change chronologically with FI, there's no reas
on you can't intermix them. you could use your 72-74 style setup, or you could 
buy a new system like yours from the busdepot with some stainless steel parts!

Yes, I suppose I should have been a bit more clear about this. Does the
FI setup on a '78 require anything specific from the exhaust system? I'm
pretty sure that there isn't an oxygen sensor on a '78, and if there were
I'm also sure I'd be able to install it on a stock '74 exhaust.

I'm going to ask Bus Depot about that $199 special -- it sounds pretty good
but it's hard to believe I'd get decent heater boxes for that price.
They have some NOS German left heater boxes right now too. Now if only there
were NOS German right heater boxes still. :)

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Oh, one other thing: should I get a new engine compartment wiring harnass fo
r the FI setup? If so, does it matter what year it's from?
&gt; 
&gt; If you find someone making them, plese let us all know! Yes they are differen
t, early 75 is unique, california/federal versions have different items. You'll
 need to be specific about your questions here.

So if I go scouring the wrecking yards for wiring harnasses, I will need
to get one from a '78? I don't think this '78 was a cali model but I guess
I'll have to find that out too. Will the engine compartment harnass from a
'78 mate up with the main harnass from my '74?

Thanks for your reply!

--Stephen
