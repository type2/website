Subject: Luggage Rack

Hello all,

My first posting and already I'm asking for something... I have a 71' westy 
that is mostly restored but I'm missing a few odd bits.  Does anyone know 
where I can get ahold of the three spacers for the rear luggage rack?  The 
ones that raise the fiberglass level with the front section.  My roof looks 
lamely uneven and I've already tried stacking washers (didn't work too well). 
 Any ideas?
