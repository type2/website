Subject: 73 adventure camper restoration

well, i finally got my auto bus into 3rd gear, i drove
her around the block and she shift like a new vehicle
with the synthetic fluids in her and all.  of course
she is slow but heck, i'm in no hurry anyway.  

i started the interior restoration and it is comming
along nicely.  so far i've replaced the far wall and
the floor, insulating both.  if you want to see the
progress so far then go to
http://photos.yahoo_dot_com/ocsd50ae and hit the 73
adventure camper button.  also, if anyone is doing
some back to the 70's bus restoration, i'll give you
these original pieces if you wish.  i'm also going to
be replacing most all the wood in the bus with wood
that is the shade of the back wall in the pic.  it
should really look nice when i'm done.
