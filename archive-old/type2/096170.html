&gt; While the curtains are off the door I am considering putting an interior

&gt; this before please let me know what has worked for you.

78 and it was crude, cut about a 1x1 inch hole in the panel just to the
right of the latch and just about an inch or so above the metal,  ran a
heavy duty wire tie around an already provided release lever,  like I
said crude but it works
