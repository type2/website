Subject: Re: [T2] 78 gas tank job pics now up

I noticed that the hose between the fill pipe and tank is different than
mine. Mine has a cloth covering on it. It appears to be in good shape. I
wonder if yours is a later 78 than mine or is it replacement hose from
sometime? I did catch a brief word of someone in
the process of repro' this hose.
As for the gunk in the tank I don't know who to take it to for that. My
father has a Stearns Knight that the tank was real bad on.
He took and ran a line off out steam boiler at our cider mill. It bubbled out
junk for days!

&gt; Folks,
&gt;
&gt; The pictures of the gas tank removal job I did yesterday on my 78
&gt; are now up.
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; To all of those that replied with hints about this job thanks!
&gt; To all of those that warned me when I got this bus and it had
&gt; been sitting for 8 years, and said pull the tank first, my apologies.
&gt;
&gt; I should have done it last summer....let that be a warning to the rest
&gt; of you....look at picture #12 to see part of what was in the tank.
&gt; This one apparently had a full tank of gas when it was parked.  What you
&gt; see is what happens to gas after sitting for 8 years.  The tank looks
&gt; &quot;ok&quot; inside except that there is still a lot of this stuck to it inside.
&gt; This is *after* it sat for 3 weeks last summer with a gallon of lacquer
&gt; thinner in it....and it still looked like this.
&gt;
&gt; several questions...
&gt;
&gt; Picture #2 shows the mustache bar support on the passenger side.
&gt; It looks like the bar is too short, but the bracket appears to be
&gt; factory...why would they do this?
&gt;
&gt; Pic #3 shows a ball bearing that was just laying where you see it...any
&gt; ideas where it came from??
&gt;
&gt; Sorry about the size of the pictures, but I squeezed them in half...tried
&gt; to keep the quality good, and the size reasonable.
&gt;
&gt; Now to find someone to &quot;boil&quot; the tank out and recoat it inside.  I know
&gt; when I'm &quot;beat&quot; on this deal...it's time for the &quot;pro's&quot; on this
&gt; one.  Anyone had any good luck with this sort of thing at the radiator
&gt; shops?....What kind of cost?  Did they do a good job?
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, dave
