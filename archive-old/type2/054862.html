Subject: Rare seat?

Hi gang

   I acquired some bench seats from a friend for a type2.  One of them is a 
full length middle seat with the folding  back rest  (&quot;bucket&quot;) on the far 
right that we've all seen on countless buses. But the other one has me 
wondering. It is also a full width middle seat, but it has the folding back 
rest buckets on BOTH ends, with a solid center section only. Has anyone ever 
seen one of these? Could it be from a model with dual side doors? I'm curious 
as to what exactly I have stumbled onto.....
   Replies would be greatly appreciatted, maybe I can help out a person who 
needs something like this......
