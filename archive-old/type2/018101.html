&gt; Gillian,

&gt; I am interested in your 'upgrade' to Volvo seats in 'Ektor'. Would you
&gt; mind sharing the details? What year Volvo seats did you use? What was
&gt; involved in the adaptation?

Sorry, I don't know the year, but I suggest you check out any big Volvos
(bigger than 440's) in the scrapyards as I have seen these lovely chunky
lblack eather seats on quite a few models. They have open headrests and
vertical stiching, are fitted with heaters (run a wire to the dash) and a
soft/hard springing option (a turn knob). The rear seats are awesome with a
fold-down armrest - great if you don't have your bed in the back.

They wouldn't fit onto the existing bus runners and we couldn't use the
Volvo runners so we just drilled the floor and fitted them in a static
position to suit us. They won't recline because of the bus bulkhead but
there is still plenty of room behind them for amplifiers or stuffing gear
(I mean camping gear, not the mind-altering substance thread!).

Ford Granada seats also do a great job, I believe your bum deserves
coddling if you are putting in decent bus miles!
