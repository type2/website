Message-Id: &lt;v01540b00b3259dc63805_at_[207.224.205.126]&gt;

I've been having a rich fuel mixture problem.  Tested all components of FI
including swapping out control unit (spare) and still showing 850-950 mvdc
on a O2 sensor I welded to the driver side exhaust manifold to heat
exchanger elbow.

The following are the advance readings at different RPMs and with and W/O
vacumn line attached:

875 RPM......7.5 BTDC
1600 RPM.....17 degreesBTDC w/o vac......31 degrees btdc w/ vac
3400 RPM.....33 degrees btdc w/o vac.....43-44 degrees btdc w/ vac

Dwell set right at 50 degrees.

With a vacumn gauge T'd into distributor line I get 22-21 degrees (and then
subtract 7.5 degree to get 14 degree approx.)  with RPM increase  and 8
inches of vacumn.  Isn't this a little high.

Are these normal advance figures.  They roughly correspond to what Bentley
shows in it's Table J. but the vacumn seems to be adding an advance which
creates a rich mixture.  Any words of wisdom?

Thanks
