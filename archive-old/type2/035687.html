Subject: 50 years of VW-buses (it's nearly Friday)

You must know that it was a Dutchman (Ben Pon) who came up with the idea of
the original VW-bus. This resulted in the introduction of the first
generation of our beloved Transporters 50 years ago. This year many events
take place to remember that fact, most of them in Germany. And in Wolfsburg
(or Hannover) the development of the fifth generation is nearing completion.

You may not know that Ben Pon's company is still the importer of VW's in
Holland. And now they've came up with another whacky idea. A brand new VW T4
tram (yes, a street railway or trolley to you Americans). To commemorate 50
years of VW buses and draw attention to VW at an auto exhibition (vans and
trucks, the heavy stuff) they have constructed a new type of people mover.
It is made up of three closely coupled Transporters (Eurovans), put on
railway wheels and being driven from the first vehicle. There is just one
driver actually controlling engine and brakes on all the vehicles. It will
move about 20 people at a time.

During the auto exhibition it will carry passengers from the Amsterdam
central station to the exhibition centre about 5 miles away running on the
tracks of the Amsterdam electric tramway system. Rest assured, the drivers
are actually 'real' tram drivers. To them this must be a Mickey Mouse tram
as they normally control vehicles that will carry over a hundred passengers
on 16 wheels in four bogies.


Sounds like an unbelievable story?
