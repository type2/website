Lori,

Maybe the mechanic's remark was not sexist. Since I've
installed VDO oil/pressure temp gauges, I monitor them too
often. My hands get sweaty as oil temp nears 250F and the
oil pressure drops to about 30 psi, while cruising down the
highway on a hot day.

I just changed the plugs and they're all a healthy tan
color, indicating ideal engine conditions, i.e., no
overheating, mixture just right, etc.

Seems that I worried less about the engine before I got the
gauges. I gotta admit, though, that now I can tell at a
glance how the engine and charging system are doing.
