Greetings all..

Interesting phenomenon this weekend...  Heading up Snoqualmie Pass in my 71
1600 dp, thought the oil might have been a bit low and the oil temp was
staying just a bit to hot for my liking...

Overfilled the engine a bit (hard to read the mark on my dipstick) and
headed on down the road.  Oil temp still wouldn't drop, regardless of my
speed.  Normally, I can drop down to 50 and it will cool a bit.  But it just
kept getting hotter and hotter.  Finally pulled off, got out and saw a trail
of oil coming from the engine compartment.  Opened up the hatch and found
the whole engine compartment coated in oil.  With the engine running, I
couldn't discern any particular place where the oil might have come from.
Having overfilled the engine with oil, I was under the impression that any
overfill would exit via the escape in the filler tube.  Not the case.  The
escape was somewhere else and the oil hitting the ground was draining from
my engine compartment.

No strange noises and the bus drove the same as always.  Just a bit hard to
start, as it always has been whenever I give it an overheat break, but
started and idled very nicely nonetheless.  The only reason I was able to
get it home was due to the fact that it was all downhill.  And even then,
the temp didn't drop like it normally does going 55 downhill....Strange
indeed.

So, my questions are these:

1) What does overfilling do to a 1600 dp engine?
2) Does an engine that is overfull lose it's ability to cool it's oil, under
normal circumstances?
3) What are some possible reasons for an engine compartment covered in oil?
I pulled the engine 9 months ago and replaced all the external (fuel pump,
gen. Stand, dizzy, etc.) seals.  Also the oil cooler seals were replaced...
4) Troubleshooting tips?
5) Other thoughts?

Cheers,

Tom
