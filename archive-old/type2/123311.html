Subject: Re: [T2] Back to the PaintScratch

Michael,

Have used paintscratch with good results on my Champagne Edition
with new base/clear coat on it in the correct colors.

Just sent them a piece off of another car(vw with &quot;special&quot; paint) and 
they hand matched it for $25....got my part and the paint back in
about 10 days.

I think their prices are a little high, but I have always gotten what
I wanted and they have a terrific color catalog.

Their website is a little difficult to use if you want multiple
colors, but you can always just call them. *Read* all of the
ordering info.

Watch out for matching 29 year old paint though...especially since
yours was *not* base/clearcoat.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Green? Anyone have experience with mail order paint ie Paint Scratch? Close, 
&gt; different tint, perfect? Suggestions are very welcome. Also this is a
