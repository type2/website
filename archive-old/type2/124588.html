Subject: Fw: engine wont idle

Subject: engine wont idle


My 73 camper bus wont idle.  It has a 71 beetle engine with a Bocar 34 PICT 3
carb.  When I pull the air cleaner off and hold the choke about halfway
closed, it idles great, but when I let the choke go back to fully open it goes
dead. It seems to run great when going down the road, but goes dead when I try
to let it idle.  Do I need to adjust the idle misture control screw?

Thanks,
 Jamie Higginbotham
