Subject: Re: [T2] 71 Dormobile how rare???

Hi Paul

I think after devon's, dormobile's are the second most common bay window 
conversion in the UK. Is this stove the one that fits under the passenger 
seat ?

If you happen to find a stove on an online auction site in the UK but they 
wont ship it to the states/ canada im willing to have it sent to my address 
and forward it on to you. I have good feedback on ebay (300+) and another 
trading site.

Thanks
Michael (UK)
