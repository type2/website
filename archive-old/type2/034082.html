Subject: Secret VW ownership

Having just read about a secret ownership and list members being involved in 
such shenanigans I feel compeled to share a family story.

Approximately 10 years ago my father was helping my younger brother restore 
his '54 VW bug.  One day, out of the blue, a '57 that had been rolled 
presented itself at a more than reasonable price.  As my brother's '54 was 
devoid of many parts that the '57 had my father could not resist the 
opportunity.  For whatever reason my father decided to keep the '57 a 
secret.  He arranged to pay the person he was buying it from to store for 
him &quot;for awhile&quot;.  Now, I must say that my father is not by nature a devious 
person.  He was not intending to keep it from my mother forever, he was just 
picking his moment.

Well, before that moment was picked my mother picked up on the fact that 
occasionally the guys in her family spoke of a '54 and at other times a '57 
was mentioned, but they were never discussed at the same time.  I must also 
say that my mother is a patient sort of person and tries to be understanding 
of the love of VW's and Porsche's.  It was not the impulse buy that upset 
her.  It was the means taken to keep it from her.  My father paid for it in 
cash and took steps to make it less than obvious in their books.  The fact 
that he also paid the person in cash to store it made things worse. And, he 
also enlisted my brother and I in his little deception.

The upshot of all this is that this little, fairly innocent, venture very 
nearly cost my father his marriage.  I'm not talking about a little fight, 
I'm talking about arranging for lawyers, the big &quot;family talk&quot; with the kids 
and the whole nine yards.

I'm sure there are extenuating circumstances in the case I just read about 
on the list and I'll make no assumptions about it, it's just that it 
reminded me of a very dark incident in my family's past related to the hobby 
we all share.

For what it's worth, after experiencing what I did with my family, I'd 
sooner jump off a building than buy a VW in secret.

Happy Holidays,

Jeffrey
