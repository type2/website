Oregon's no self-serve law will probably stand forever, making me realize how
important it is to direct the attendants at gas stations to be ever so
careful. Case-in-point: My last fill-up caused the employee so much grief that
he seemingly wanted to rip the side of my '79 standard apart. In the process,
a large amount of gas spilled all over the side the bus. He used a squeegee to
clean it up. I informed him of my need to help before this happened yet he
told me he could handle it; obviously not. As much as it irritates gas station
employees to offer my assistance in something they are paid to do, I say, &quot;Too
bad!&quot; I'm comforted to know I'm not the only one with this problem. Oregon and
New Jersey bus owners--be careful! This particular gas station told me if this
happened again, and damage occurred, I would be responsible!

Happy Busing!
