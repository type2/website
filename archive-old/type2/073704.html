Best bet is a locksmith. Tell them you want the doors etc matched to the
ignition key. If you can take out the locks and deliver them to a locksmith
shop, it will be much quicker. I have also seen them listed as a &quot;set&quot; in
HotVW magazine. Dunno the company.
Good luck, mine cost me less than $25 for the resetting of 3 doors and hatch
to match the ignition key. Now 1 key does it all.......

So the '70 Westy that I got today turns out to have 3 different keys for it.
I can find new ignitions, and new door handles all day long, but does anyone
have suggestions for ordering them all matched?  I can't find them as a set.

Thanks,

Bryan Castles
