Subject: Transform, MoFoCo,

Volks,

I purchased a transaxle from Transform last summer for my '65 Deluxe. 
It was my first transaxle removal and replacement (with verbal 
guidance via B. Hoover).  These guys were 
pretty knowledgable, knowing pretty much what I would need to do 
this.  They suggested replacing nose cone, getting axle boots, etc. 
to do the job complete.  

They did sort of have the &quot;know it all&quot; attitude tho...  

So far, the transaxle has been excellent (~15,000 miles).

I've also delt with MOFOCO, (introduced to me by Ron Van Ness).  Got 
the material to complete a pair of new, bare, heads and a stock 
brazilian muffler set-up.  They got the order right on both 
accounts...
order right and complete.
