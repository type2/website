&gt; Jason, you said original paperwork?
&gt;
&gt; Any possibility of an original window/price sticker?
&gt;
&gt; I would love to have a good scanned image of one that I could print
&gt; out and put on my bus(78 Champagne Edition) when I take to the show in
&gt; August.
&gt;
&gt; No one else seem to have a 78, although I have gotten a 73.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, dave
