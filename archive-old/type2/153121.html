&gt; Hi All!
&gt; 
&gt; I need to let go of my 76 High Roof, we have had many fun adventures  
&gt; (and a few not so fun :) but I think it is time.  My homeowners  
&gt; association is always on the look out for it to go non-operational  and 
&gt; I have had enough.  I think I will be focusing on the 79 standard  bus 
&gt; in the garage for a while.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway,  The bus is a 76, has a 79 engine and is in good shape for  the 
&gt; age.  Couple of oil leaks, etc but over all is working well.  The  only 
&gt; significant rust is the battery tray (needs a new one).  The  interior 
&gt; is super nice and it looks good.
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to get $3500 for it but I am open to offers/possible  
&gt; trades (I'm a sucker for homeless VW's).
&gt; 
&gt; Send pmail or give me a call at 970-690-1172
&gt; 
&gt; Pictures are available upon request.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
