&gt;   At Everybus I saw a bus drive in at night that headlights as bright as my
&gt; new Honda.  I think they were on one of the flag painted buses, but I'm not
&gt; sure which one.  If this was you, can you tell me what kind of light bulbs
&gt; you use?  Or if its not you and you have a suggestion for some bright
&gt; headlights, please let me know what brand you're using.

Hella H4 halogen 'stock brightness' 55/60W bulbs.


Brighter is not always better.  Think efficiency rather
than brute force.  And be considerate - don't blind other
motorists!

Why are your current headlights not bright enough?
Check your headlamp electrical ground connections.
Confirm the status of your battery and charging system. 
Aim your headlights properly.  Upgrade from sealed-beam
lamps to halogen lamps.

Good luck,
