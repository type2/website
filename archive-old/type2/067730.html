Subject: distributors/rotors on 70

Hi all - I started my winter maintenizing (sic) this weekend... patched
that pesky hole in the muffler, reconnected the autochoke, changed oil (and
realized this motor doesn't have a thermostat - doh!). When I redid the
valves and set the timing, I started to take a good look at my distributor.
It is a 009, I assume it to be German. It has the &quot;(=)&quot; (Bosch?) symbol;
part # 0 231178 009, also stamped Z 42 and (050). The rotor is black
plastic, part# 1234332 215, stamped &quot;.08&quot; and(R5).
Does this sound right? I don't want to set the timing for a &quot;german&quot; 009 if
it is in fact &quot;brazilian,&quot; &quot;indian,&quot; etc. I am running a solex 30 pict...
damn, I think 2 (its dark out now!), and a SP 1600; seems to run ok - spits
LOTS of unburned gas at idle, tho -- just want to make sure I'm not setting
myself up for a problem down the road.
