a few questions:
where can i find some tent poles?  from visiting some site ive determined 
that my tent is a white stag model.  there are no markings on it that i can 
find.  it connects to the sliding door side of my camper.
my steering box exudes occasional squeaks now and then.  is there a way i 
can oil it up or do i have to prepare to buy one?
lastly, my fuel gauge sending unit is faultly.  can i get it recalibrated or 
do i need to fork out some dough and buy a new one.
