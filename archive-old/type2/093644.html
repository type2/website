Subject: Re: [T2] valve adjusting wrench

Snap on and Mac make box ends with bigger offsets that work nicely for 
valve adjustments and brake bleeding.  Of course the price is a &quot;bit&quot; 
higher for these wrenches.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; Has anyone found a good 13mm box end wrench for adjusting valves.
&gt; I've tried several, none have a really good fit, and the angle seems 
&gt; awkward.
&gt; Consequently, the nuts are rounding off with each adjustment.
&gt; thanks Crisp
