Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel tank return fuel nipple (converting to FI)

Hello Ben,

About the gas tank.I don't know about using the vent
line. I probably wouldn't install a &quot;T&quot; fitting in it.
The fuel pressure could cause the fuel to go straight
up the vent lines and in your charcoal canister. It
would probably work better to just connect the return
line directly to the vent nipple. Here is another
thing about doing this that bothers me. F.I. fuel tank
has both nipples at the bottom of the tank where there
is always going to be gasoline present. connecting the
return line to the vent nipple at the top of the tank
&quot;could&quot; cause the fuel to siphon back into the gas
tank and cause air to get into the fuel rail when the
bus is left for any ammount of time. This might cause
hard starting. This is just speculation on my part. I
am finishing up my F.I. which I installed on a 914 2.0
in my 74 bus. I went ahead and bought a f.i. fuel tank
and installed it instead of modifying my old tank.

Seeing that you have a 1700cc engine and you are using
an f.i. made for a 2000cc engine, the only thing that
you might notice is your engine might run a little
rich but is should work fine.

I do know that your accelerator cable will have to be
modified. Right now, your accelerator cable is
probably located on the drivers side of the engine
compartment. To use your F.I., you will have to find a
way to route the cable to the passanger's side of the
engine compartment. My transmission carrier already
had a hole through it on the passanger's side. All I
did was made the hole a little bigger with a bigger
drill bit. I just made the hole big enough for the
plastic sleeve that goes around the cable to slide
through. Also, you will probably find that your cable
is too long and will need to be trimed down for F.I.

Some people opted to weld in the air cleaner stand
from a late model bus. My bus never had one of these
metal stands so I just secured the air cleaner to the
engine compartment ceiling with large plastic wire
ties. It works well and is not noticable. If you have
any questions, feel free to ask. I am almost finsihed
with my engine.I got it to run for the first time
today on its own power. So far, so good. I have a few
odds and ends to straighten out and hook up and then I
can focus on the body of my Bus....

Well have a great day!

Regards,

David KElly

P.S. I want to thank everyone on the list who helped
me get my F.I. running!

&gt; Hi guys,
&gt; I will convert my bus (1.7L) to FI... Mike Boland
found me a good used and complete
&gt; 1978 2.0L FI.
&gt; 
&gt; Almost everything is out of the bus, so i was ready
&gt; to remove the fuel 
&gt; tank to add a fuel nipple return line for the FI.
&gt; But! why not use one of the existing ventilation
&gt; nipple (look at the 
&gt; picture):
&gt; http://www_dot_desert2002_dot_com/fuel_tank1.htm
&gt; 
&gt; Would the pressure be to much and overflow at the
&gt; end of that line 
&gt; (going into the air filter) instead of going into
&gt; the tank?
&gt; &gt; I could also use this nipple without a &quot;T&quot;
fitting?
&gt; If the left nipple 
&gt; is use as a return fuel line,  would only one
&gt; ventilation tube be 
&gt; sufficient?
&gt; 
&gt; Also, i would appreciate any advice, tricks or
&gt; comments on those who 
&gt; made the conversion to FI.
&gt; What other big modification as to be made... Is it a
problem if the FI was design for a 2.0L, i
&gt; have a 1.7L
&gt; 
&gt; Best regards, Ben
