Subject: Thanks Everyone !! (Going Down Under)

Volks,

Well the time has come for me to say good-bye for a while.  This is my last day at this job until 
next April.  I'll be staying on for a few more weeks in another section doing field work using GPS 
for mapping cutblocks.  As some may remember, I had planned a trip south in my 76 Westy.  
Well that plan has changed as everything in my life seems to - I was offered a chance to go WAY 
south to tour Australia and New Zealand for the entire winter with a good friend and I don't 
want to miss this kind of opportunity.  The sad part of it is that I am selling my van to fund the 
trip.  It is currently sitting in Edmonton with the hopes that some kind soul will give her a good 
home. 

I just wanted to thank everyone on the list (and the old V_at_L) for offering advice, know-how and 
for fueling my love of VW's.  I'm proud to be a part of such a great community. Also, thanks to 
all those who offered their tour-guide services (and driveways) around the west coast back when 
the road trip was still planned. Maybe next year :-)  So, I guess, if any of you folks down under 
want to show me a slice of the world down there, or just get together for a beer and good ol' VW 
chat, then drop me a line (I'm sure VW withdrawl will have set in fully by the time I get down 
there! ). I'll be arriving in Auckland Nov 2.  

   BTW- co-worker is still looking for a nice breadloaf (non-camper) by mid October if any 
Vancouver/Seattle types see anything.  I'll still be recieving mail at this address until about Oct 
13.  I'll likely repost the ad in a few weeks if I don't hear anything.  I'll be signing off the list 
probably tomorrow AM.  Once again, thanks to everyone out there and take care,

Sincerely,

Mike Peebles
