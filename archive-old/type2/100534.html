Subject: RE: [T2] fall/winter North Carolina oil

I know that oil is a very personal and subjective topic, but I figure i'd 
add my $0.04.  I think the anomalous symmptoms we are hearing, regarding the 
oil fluctuations are telling us more about the engines in question than the 
oil.  Rebuild quality is also a subjective topic, and I believe this is more 
obvious in type 1's than type 4's because of their weaker nature(magnesium 
vs. alu.).  Bearing tolerances and undersizing of journals has a HUGE impact 
on oil temperature/pressure readings.  In my own experience, I have been 
lucky enough to get a quality rebuild(type 1) from a place in Sacramento 
that allows me to use one weight of oil, year round.  I moved to Boise ID 
last year, and have seen harsher winter conditions here(about the same in 
summer:triple digits) that did not require me to change my oil viscosity.  I 
run Delo 400 15W-40 all year long.  My pressures are excellent warm and 
cold, and my temps are stable as well.  And for clarification, I'm the guy 
with the '091 that likes to drive 75 mph.
