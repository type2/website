Subject: Detonation Help

Hello all,
My bus is having problems with detonating. I'm running
93 octane and I've screwed around with the timing
going anywhere from 4 degrees to 12. I dont have a
tach so I dont know what my rpms are however I think
that its around 875 like VW recomends. there has been
some pinging happening and when I go up hills and
punch the accelerator it begins to ping and then
changes to a full rough noise and the engine suddenly
slows. I dont know if its all cylinders firing way
before top dead or some other problem. thanks for any
help,
Giles,
78 T2, Anya
