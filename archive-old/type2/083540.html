Subject: Re: [T2] vent wing wind noise

well, all your really need is basic hand tools, a
drill and a rivet gun.  you drill out the pivot point
at the top outside of the wing and then you'll have it
in 2 pieces.  now is a great time for rust prevention
on the painted parts.  then you basically replace the
seals and put her back together.  the seal directly
touching the window need not be replaced unless your a
masocist as i have not figured a way to easily replace
it.  when putting the seals on i have found that the
nasty black window sealing stuff that never dries is
awsome and will never leak or dry out.  this can be
bought at most all auto glass hops for aroud 10 bucks.
 after putting all the seals on and the little fiber
washer between the metal parts of the riveted pivot
point, re-rivet them together and bend that pivot
point until you have the glass square on the seal so
no air can enter.  i don't have any pics currently but
it all makes good sense when you rip into it.  like i
had said previously, the hardes part is taking them
out of the doors without screwing your paint up.
&gt; someone had previously mentioned that you needed a
&gt; whole new window to eliminate the wind noise.  this 
is
&gt; quite untrue.  all it takes is removing the wing
&gt; frame, replacing the seals and bending the pivot
&gt; points until you have a complete seal.  i have done
&gt; this on my bug and am going to do this on the bus 
when
&gt; time permits.  it is a relatively easy job for the
&gt; beginer, the hardest part being getting the wing out
&gt; of the door.

Is it possible for you to write up a how-to on this 
procedure? I'm very 
interested in doing the same for my bus and bug..

Pictures would be nice :-)
