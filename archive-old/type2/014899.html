Subject: Dead of Winter Campout report
Mime-Version: 1.0

Here is a quick little trip report on Peach State Transporter's Dead of 
Winter campout last weekend.

I was not going up until Saturday morning, but a few people went up 
Friday night.  I think the Drake's, McDevitt's, Neal's, Ratterree's 
and Mr. Raistrick were there Friday night, so they will have to fill 
in Friday night details.

Friday morning I was supposed to meet Ron &amp; Jonathan in the main lot 
of Southern Tech at 9am to caravan up to Cloudland Canyon.  I got there 
at about 9:05am &amp; did not see anyone, so I circled the campus and threw 
a bunch of motorcylce parts into a dumpster on campus.  I went back to 
the main lot &amp; still saw nobody, so I went down the street to get gas.

When I got back Jonathan was there &amp; we took off.  Less than 30 minutes 
into the trip I looked in my mirror &amp; saw no Jonathan.  I got off at the 
next exit &amp; started backtracking to find him.  He was about 3 exits back.

By the time I got there he had already figured his fuel pump had stopped 
working, so all we had to do was figure out why.  I crawled underneath 
while his girlfriend Holly turned the switch on.  No clicking from the 
electric fuel pump.  I rapped it to see if it was stuck, but that made 
no difference.  I traced the wiring back to the coil &amp; the connector had 
slid off the + terminal.  Reconnected it &amp; we were back on the road.

The rest of the trip up was uneventful, except the last 8 miles up the 
mountain we were stuck behind a Ryder truck c-r-e-e-p-i-n-g along.  We 
were not the slowest vehicles going up the mountain!

We pulled in, said hello to everyone and most everybody went hiking down 
into the canyon to the 1st waterfall.  We had a nice hike and hung out 
at the waterfall for a while.  After that some of us decided to take the 
quick (strenuous) route (straight up) to the canyon rim rather than the 
slow meandering route.

We arrived at the rim about 30 minutes earlier that the rest, but we were 
a little worse for wear.  We walked around and talked to new arrivals.

Joe Fournier had arrived and we commenced with a &quot;private&quot; swap meet on 
the picnic table at my campsite.  Joe was trading me a bunch of split bus 
parts for a T4 2.0l engine I had.  Joe had stripped a '65 bus and took off 
a lot of parts I usually leave on a bus (like the flaps that divert air 
from front to back in the fresh air box).

We listened to Joe's &quot;Muir Engine Sounds&quot; tape while we did this.  If some 
of you heard what Ol' John M. thought a &quot;good&quot; VW engine sounded like, you 
probably would not be so quick to tout him as the &quot;Patron Saint of All 
Things Volkswagen&quot; (Compleat Idiot or not).

After this Bo Drake brought out his new banjo &amp; I pulled out my guitar.  
I proved to everyone that I cannot keep time with bluegrass music, since 
most of what I play is folk music.  I handed my guitar over to Chad 
Carmichael &amp; he and Bo butchered a few songs while the rest of us enjoyed 
the music.

After dark the instruments were put away and we gathered at the campfire 
by Bo &amp; Tonya's campsite.  We talked bad about people who were not there 
or were far enough away to not hear us, told lies, and swapped &quot;adventure&quot; 
stories.

About 9:30pm it started to rain &amp; people scattered back to their campsites.  
It rained a good bit of the night and the wind blew like hell early the 
next morning.

We milled around a bit Sunday morning and people began leaving.  There 
were people in a light blue &amp; white '73 &amp; up bus that I never did get to 
meet.  They left about 9:30am.  If you are on the list, send me a note so 
I will know to invite you to upcoming events.  Maybe I'll get to say hello 
to you then!

Due to the weather conditions I had to cancel my crowd pleasing rocket-bus 
jump over the canyon.

By about 11:30am almost everyone was leaving and a few of us decided to 
caravan back to the Atlanta area.  We had to stop at the Ranger station so 
David Raistrick &amp; Lisa could pay for their campsites since Ranger Rick was 
so sure they planned to skip out on their bill.

So Ron, Lisa, David, Jonathan, &amp; I caravaned back, losing Lisa somewhere 
near Calhoun.  We pulled over &amp; Raistrick went back looking for her, but 
did not find her.  Lisa, send me a note to let me know you got home OK.

time!  We had a total of 18 buses show up.
