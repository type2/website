&gt;As you can see, based on my subject line, I've got some questions.  I
&gt;installed a tach today in my, what I believe to be a, stock 1979 Federal
&gt;Westy (90K on the odometer).  I've perused the owner's manual and Bentley
&gt;looking for a statement regarding motor red-line and didn't see any mention
&gt;- I also did a search in the archives and didn't find what I was looking for
&gt;either.

5400 rpm is the limit.

&gt;Second, now that I've got a tach, I notice that I'm idling a bit high ~1200
&gt;rpm.  I'm guessing that I'm going to have to read up on tuning.  Any pearls
&gt;of wisdom before I begin?

If your timing/dwell are in spec then you can lower the idle speed by turning the large screw on the throttle body clockwise.

&gt;Oh yes, one more thing. I am new to busses and, boy is it far from the motor
&gt;to the dash (wire wise that is).  As I am planning to get a CHT gauge and I
&gt;know that wire length could very well be an issue. what is the preferred
&gt;path one takes to run wires from engine gauges (CHT, Oil Pressure, Oil Temp)
&gt;to dash?

17 ft. is the length from spark plug #3 to the dash including a little slack. Run the wires in a loom and keep them away from larger wires carrying current such as the 6.0mm2 red/white wire that connectors the battery (via starter) and the fusebox.
