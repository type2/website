Subject: Clarification

The Reader's Digest condensed version: I got my AVP engine installed,
but it appears that the right head was, er, flycut too much (?) and we
can't cure the exhaust leak, even after trying three separate heat
exchangers and various arcane tricks of the trade. So my VW guy is in
communication with AVP to see how they want to work out the logistics of
replacing that head. Don't know how long that'll take or how much it's
gonna cost.

To make Everybus I would have to leave this Saturday the 14th. With no
time to break in the engine, on a tight budget and a tight schedule, and
even though Kelly was game to fix the nose on my bus in his driveway, it
was a stretch since he's moving to larger quarters right then. We'll get
this done there so long as he doesn't mind holding onto the donor front
clip for a bit.

The whole thing was starting to feel &quot;forced&quot; and I've been stressing
about lack of time, lack of money, lack of preparation, and I was
wondering if I should bring along the little cat who'd shown up on
Friday the 13th back in October (named him Jason, of course), and was
promising to be a great bus cat and he was just the joy of my life. He
took to the collar, he took to the harness, and leash-training was next.
He'd hang around in, around, and on top of the 69 when I worked on it.
He got killed by a hit and run driver two weeks ago and I'm just
devastated (as are all my girls in the neighborhood, who had been
befriended by Jason). It's not been a good year for me for cats (I'd
lost two old ones; July and December).

So I'm beginning to think this manifold issue with my bus is perhaps a
message that now is not the right time, that I'm not in the right frame
of mind at the very least, to safely travel so far right now. Predators
sense weakness, and I'm quite muddle-headed right now.

I had a really great time at Everybus last year, and I'll miss everyone
-- especially Steve, David, John, and Mike. Sorry I couldn't keep my end
of the deal, John and Mike. Maybe Oktoberbus....
