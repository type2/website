&gt;  I, too, have a lot of electricals and I felt I would benefit from an 
&gt;  alternator because my ammeter was not showing much current.  

The following assumes an ammeter of the central zero type which has been 
correctly wired up.

The reading on the Ammeter is not relevant to the type of generator which is 
in use be it alternator or dynamo. And it's normal condition is with the 
needle pointing to the central zero position.

On start-up power is taken from the battery and the generator replaces it 
causing deflection of the ammeter needle to one side from its central zero 
position. As the battery is charged the needle returns to zero.

However if there's a fault in the battery then it may continue charging 
'forever' and the needle will continually deflect to the charging side.

If the needle deflects in the opposite direction then the usage of 
electricity exceeds that being output by the generator. If this persists then 
the battery will go flat.

So the correctly fitted ammeter measures only the rate of charge/discharge of 
the battery (excluding the starting current).

There are two reasons why you may wish to upgrade from a dynamo to an 
alternator
First - high power lights, stereo etc. etc. using more electric than is being 
produced
Second - if you do a lot of short runs with use of the starter and much 
idling then the alternator will produce its current at lower revs than the 
dynamo so will both charge the battery faster and will do so at even at tick 
over.

I would also add that an electrician friend of mind prefers his dynamo as the 
lower charge rate for the battery produces a fuller charge in the long run.

Before you ask heres what I would consider the 'correct' wiring for a centre 
zero ammeter on a loaf (may vary with other models of type 2 or other 
vehicles)....

    |------Starter

battery

1.  Disconnect battery
2.  take the wire from the starter to the fuse box off of the fuse box
3.  connect that to the ammeter
4.  take a wire that can carry 60% of the dynamo/alternator output and 
connect the fuse box (where you removed the wire in step 2) to the other side 
of the ammeter
5.  take the same size wire (as in step 4) and connect the same point on the 
fuse box to the dynamo/alternators regulator output. At the same time 
completely removing the wire that previously connected the regulator to the 
starter motor.

I have suggested 60% capacity wires because you will exceed that very rarely 
and then for such short periods that you will not fry the system - you might 
see 20 to 25 Amps after a hard start and with a flat camping battery but it 
will drop towards zero very quickly.

It should also be noted that if you have a dynamo fitted then you could well 
have a 30amp ammeter so upgrading to an alternator will also require upgrade 
to a 60 amp ammeter so that you don't have an electrical failure due to gauge 
overload.

Good luck
