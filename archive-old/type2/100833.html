Subject: Re: [T2] Heater questions (replacement of ducting)

yeah, I wouldn'r use PVC either
I just insulated the OS tube with
the thin reflective insulation from
home d-poh, it's basically bubble
wrap with reflrctive mylar or something on the 
outside.  It seems to do the job great with
the bilge fan in-line.
Fells like a blow-dryer after 15 min.

&gt; My question is what have folks used as non-stock
&gt; replacements for heater ducting?

Some have used PVC or somesuch, but I don't think it is a good idea.  Home
