Subject: Re: [T2] Cheap buses (was CHEEP BUSES)

But as I said to Jammy, you need to fill in some details. How long ago 
were these purchases? How many miles on the bus? How long/how many 
miles did you drive it on a $600 (first) and approximately $1500 
(second) investment?

I can claim that I bought a bus for $440 and it ran great. (Thus 
leaving out that it wouldn't pass smog, needed an entire FI system that 
I installed with a leak that burned out a piston, etc. etc. etc.)

&gt; Very little was rusted out and I spent ~ $200.00 on a used tranny. I 
&gt; had a buddy
&gt; who lived close by and was a fantastic (hobyist) vw mechanic.
&gt;
&gt; My second bus was a '79 (I loved that bus!). The third cylinder had a 
&gt; shot valve
&gt; and it cost $1300. It had no rust whatsoever. I bought a used head for 
&gt; $75.00
&gt; and also had to buy new CV joints.
