&gt; easiest route would be to take the fuel pump off, remove the push rod,

Bob and Fritz:
MUCH more satisfactory would be to leave the stock mechanical pump in
place and re-route the hoses, bypassing the electric pump. Hook the
inlet hose from the electric hose to its outlet and unhook the wire.
Save it for emergencies. Stock pumps never put out too much pressure and
flood the carb. And they always shut off when the engine does. There's a
good reason manufacturers don't use ignition-switch-triggered electric
fuel pumps without safety interlocks and that's fear of lawsuits from
incinerated victims.
Sure, maybe you think it's safe enough, but what about your family's
safety when your bus is laying on its side and that fuel pump is
whirring merrily away pumping gasoline out the now sideways carb onto
the inside of the engine compartment? Meanwhile, your dazed young
children are crying for your help and trying to get out the vertically
opening driver's door because the bus is laying on the passenger side.
At this point, wouldn't you really rather not have to worry about fuel
pumps?
Just because you can doesn't mean you should!
