&gt; Using the stick is a little weird after the tight movement of the S's stick.

Just pretend you are in Vegas losing all your money at the slots. ;-)

&gt; Is the stick supposed to lay up against the side of your right leg?  Or is
&gt; my bus just letting me know that he's fond of his new owner?

No. Bentley has the correct orientation (Transmission and Rear Axle, page
11).

Do check that you've got the Front Shift Rod Bushing, 1974 to 1979
(211-711-182). Missing:

Installed:

It will take a lot of slop out of the shifter and some of the difficulty
getting it into gear (assuming you got a knob).

&gt; Needs shocks, or I'm just not use to the ride, yet.  The steering is a bit
&gt; loose, I don't like the few degrees of play.

Could be or just the steering damper is shot. Take off all 4 shocks and the
damper and inspect them. Chances are from the shape your bus appears to be
in that they are dead. If you have any green ones, they could even be
originals.
