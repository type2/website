The Bentley maual has an excellent procedure for resetting the trailing
arms. There are also three articles on this subject in the suspension
section of the type2_dot_com library.

Note that if you have a passenger bus readjusting your torsion bars will
last for another 20 years and you will have to repeat the procedure.  If
you want to keep your bus longer without further sag then you should
replace the torsion bars with a heavy-duty set from a camper or commercial
bus.

                             OOK!
