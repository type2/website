&gt; Look for 1 or 2 (cant remember) 10 MM bolts holding the drum to the hub,
&gt; remove those then bang the drum off of the hub, they separate.  This is in
&gt; the bently.. look at the pictures.

Actually, the 2 bolts are 11mm or 7/16ths. [after they rust a bit, a 10 will
fit:)]

&gt; If you have run your bus without rear hubcaps for any length of time
&gt; figure the hub will be rusted to the drum. Yes, hubcaps have afunction
&gt; other than looks ;)

This is why they are called hubcaps!

On new cars they are called 'wheel covers'.
