Subject: Re: [T2] [Fwd: Tach/Dwell Meter Usage Question?]

The Dwell meter is supposed to work on electronic ignition, so that is not a
problem. My vanagon is federal so still has the points. At some point I will
move to something like the Pertronix system, though I want to find out if the
igniter II is available for my year first.

Yes I hooked up the black lead to ground and the green lead to the negative
side of the coil (green wire running to the distributor). This is per how the
meter is supposed to be used. The van won't start with the meter installed in
this manner. Currently have it set to RPM mode as I just want to see what the
idle speed is. As the meter works on the newer Isuzu, I think something else
strange must be going on. The van has only 49,500 original miles (I have had
it for only 200 miles) and so I believe that the points, cap and condenser are
probable close to being 20 years old also. I have new parts on order and will
replace everything when they arrive. I just wanted to make sure everything
worked before I went into replacement mode.

Thanks for the advice.
Regards,

&gt; &gt; I just got a used Tach/Dwell meter from someone on ebay to do the points
&gt; &gt; on my 82 aircooled van. The dwell meter is electronic and works on my
&gt; &gt; Isuzu. When I connect it to the coil on the vanagon, I cannot start the
&gt; &gt; van. It seems to short or load down the signal.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What gives?  Is this an indication that the coil is going or that only
&gt; &gt; the older dwell meters can be used? Incompatibility with the AFC
&gt; &gt; L-Jetronic fuel injection system?
&gt;
&gt; Jeff,
&gt;
&gt; First, it sounds like you are hooking it up incorrectly.  the black lead
&gt; goes to Ground (the engien case or fan shroud), the red wire goes to the
&gt; terminal on the coil that the lead from the distributor (usually green)
&gt; goes to.  If yu hook it to the other lead on the coil, then you are indeed
&gt; creating a path from power to ground, shorting the circuit and the bus
&gt; will not start.
&gt;
&gt; Second, if your bus is a California model and has electronic ignition (or
&gt; just has electronic ignition), checking the dwell is not a good idea.
&gt; Some dwell meters are safe for use with electronic ignition, some are not
&gt; and I don't know which are and which are not.  Since dwell on an
&gt; electronic ignition system is not adjustable, there is not sense in
&gt; checking it.
