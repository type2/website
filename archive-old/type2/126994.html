Subject: Bay Window Glass

Does anyone need any of the glass out of a '68 Bay Window 
Bus?  Everything is there.  It is a Westy so the roll out 
long windows are also present.  The passenger side roll out 
window needs a pane replaced, but I have a replacement 
piece you can use.

I am willing to take offers or trades for any or all of 
these windows. 

I wanted to put the offer here, before I put them on The 
Samaba.

Thanks,
