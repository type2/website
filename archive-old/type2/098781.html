Subject: Summer Oil pressure drop + higher temperatures with oil error
  (Was: Is 20w50 Oil OK in the winter?)

This new learning amazes me.

Here is something interesting. Last summer I brought Pokey in 
for an oil change (yes I know I should be doing it myself but 
oil changes are cheap and I find myself too busy sometimes) 
and they inadvertently used 10w30. All of a sudden I saw a 
drop in oil pressure (maybe to 20 psi on the highway), and 
much higher operating themperatures. Hence I went out and 
bought an auxillary oil cooler (as yet to be installed).

The season was ending, it got colder out and my temperatures 
fell back into acceptable levels. The pressure did not come 
back and I was going to look into this over the witer. I was 
going to get the oil changed again (hence my original 
question - If you did not read my previous post, I was 
wondering about using 20w50 in the winter as that is what I 
normally run.).

Now forgive me, my mechanical incompetance is surely 
showing... but could the change in oil from 20w50 to 10w30 
account for this drop in pressure and higher temperatures?

Thanks,
Chris

&gt;Is 20w5 Oil OK in Winter? I drive my van almost exclusively 
&gt;in the summer and have always used Castrol GTX 20w50 Oil. 
&gt;Now it is December, temperature is just below freezing, but 
&gt;the roads in Toronto are free of snow and salt. I was 
&gt;thinking of using the van to help in my move. I have to 
&gt;change the oil nyway so I was wondering what weight I should 
&gt;use in the winter months. In my Chevy I always use 10w30 in 
&gt;summer and 5w30 in Winter.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Chris
