&gt; I figured even if the valve timing were off a couple notches (I did align
the gears
&gt; up per the manual) that I'd get some compression. But none? I does seem to
have
&gt; compression when I turn the engine over manually. Arghh.
&gt;
&gt; I thought I'd query the list one more time before pulling the engine again
and
&gt; going over it.
&gt;
Here is a quick test to check valve timing:
Remove left, 3/4, valve cover. Turn engine in direction of rotation and
watch #3 valves. You will see nothing move for a while. Then you will see
the exhaust valve open and close. Just as the exhaust closes the intake will
start to open. Stop. At the point of the exhaust closing and the intake
opening #1 should be at TDC and your timing mark should be on zero. If
neither happens, your cam timing is off.
