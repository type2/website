Subject: Good Friday,Charlie Brown...

I was drivin' my Bus the other night when I had a slight
accident, so I pulled into the nearest parking area of
a bar...I walked in and asked, &quot;Is anyone missing a five
foot penguin?&quot;
No one seemed to be missing their penguin, however...
&quot;Oh great,&quot; I said, &quot;Looks like I just ran over a nun... ;-(
