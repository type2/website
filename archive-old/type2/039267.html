Subject: CV Joint Presses, Gas Smells

I only succeeded in getting one out of four cv joints
off the drive shafts of my 80 Westfalia.  I was
hitting the metal so hard you could smell it getting
hot.  Does anyone have any experience pressing these
off?  I was wondering if an inexpensive 10 or 20 ton
press from Harbor Freight might succeed where a hammer
failed?  Since I also have an 82 diesel camper, I may
consider buying a press.

If I totally fill my 80 with gas, I get a strong
gasoline odor.  This lasts until I drive a while to
use up a gallon or so.  The smell seems most prominent
under the front fenders where the plastic overflow
tanks are.  I can't feel or see any signs of leaking. 
One thought I had was the charcoal canister was no
longer trapping the gas vapors.  I wonder if you can
still buy these, and if strong gas smells result when
they are bad?  My other thought is with smells this
strong, a little liquid must be leaking out with a
fill up.  I can feel the three grommets at the
crossover pipe areas, but I can't reach the fuel
sender gage.  Anyone have any experience solving gas
smells?
