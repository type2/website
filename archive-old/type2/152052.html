&gt; Hey, Jules, when you find a steering wheel puller for your '71 that will NOT
&gt; break the plastic surrounds of the steering wheel, be sure to share that
&gt; info with the list.

I have never found a steering wheel that just sitting in the seat and
alternately pulling up on one side then the other that did not come off.
maybe a slight tap on the bottom with ye olde rubber mallet.  now I am
sure if Barry can't get it off then it is on pretty tight but I would
start with a little patience and pulling STRAIGHT up.
