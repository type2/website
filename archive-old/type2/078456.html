Subject: Re: [T2] Metal fuel line

I was reading over the archives looking for hints and now I'd think I'd
describe it as the shellac like substance that the gas has turned into.

Rats.

Does the engine have to be lowered on a '78 camper in order to remove the
gas tank?

&gt;&gt;&gt; I was replacing some fuel lines and reinstalling my fuel pump yesterday.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I noticed that the metal line that is above the tranny is
&gt;&gt;&gt; rusted real bad. I was going to use a piece of brake line, but wanted to
&gt;&gt;&gt; make sure that will be ok first. Do they sell metal fuel
&gt;&gt;&gt; line in lengths like brake line?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; My van has been sitting for a few years and I just started to work on it
&gt;&gt; again...
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; There's some rubber hose that been used for the fuel line (was interim
&gt;&gt; solution to shut off flow of gas so filter could be easily changed; I've got
&gt;&gt; the rusty gas tank problem)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Anyway, I just discovered that some of it is clogged with black goo.  Does
&gt;&gt; this sound like the remains of old gas/rust or has the gas reacted with the
&gt;&gt; hose (black colored) and soldified?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I hope it's only the hose because that's easy to replace.  I'd hate to have
&gt;&gt; to unclog the the line further because it's really tough stuff.  Has anyone
&gt;&gt; else had this problem?
