Subject: Platinum Plugs

I don't understand why anyone would want to use them anyway. Like Don said 
they may last longer but why not commit to a regular changing. I check spark 
plugs as a visual inspection when I do oil changes. Most of the time they 
cost a couple of bucks more each. Even beyond the Platinum ones are the ones 
that have two even four prongs on the endand you do not set the gap. What! 
That scares me. You can't set them, you can't check them, of course the cost 
is double or more.

AdvanceAuto around here has a special every so often where they sell the 
Bosch Supers for $0.99 ea. Usually when I see the sale ad or sign in the 
window I pick up a set or what they have on hand. I was looking for some 
parts last night for another listee and I found two sets. &quot;That's where I 
put those.&quot; This past weekend I looked in the glove box and there was a 
fresh set there, too. Looks like I have plenty for now and an very happy. ;)

Did someone say &quot;Snake Oil&quot;?
