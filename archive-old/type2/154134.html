Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum Leak in Crankcase?

----- Original Message ----- 
From: &quot;DurocShark&quot; &lt;durocshark_at_gmail_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Today I pulled the hose off the crankcase vent and pinched it. No
&gt; vacuum leak!!

Don
I found a pushrod tube with a hole in it once...  that was the &quot;crank case&quot; 
vac leak.
I have also found rocker cover gaskets that have fallen inside on the top 
edge .. if it was the bottom edge,, they would leak oil... but because it 
was the top.. it just allows the case to vent there.. and the EFi doesn't 
like that.

I don't think there is a valve anywhere your looking.. I could be wrong tho.
your never going to have enough lungs to draw a vac with your mouth on the 
crankcase vent.. there is a lot of volume , and tiny leaks in the crankcase.
