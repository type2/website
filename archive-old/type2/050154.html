Subject: Re: [T2] CV Boot replacement

I just put on a set of Beck Arnley boots that are for a porsche (maybe I'll
go faster :)  They are american made and I am hopeful they will give me
more than a few months of crack free life.  If anyone wants the part number
I wrote it down somewhere...

In the directions that came with the boots they said to vent the boot of
any air excess air that can be trapped while installing.  They said trapped
air can lead to premature failure.

FWIW

I don't know.  I always use the specified amount, as much as I can get
into the CV and the rest into the hub depression and the boot.
