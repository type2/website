&gt;The carnage that followed is too horrific a story to tell--as I
&gt;mercilessly crushed every soldier in sight...

QUIT KILLING OUR ANTS. It takes us *weeks* to train them to distinguish
between Yankees and real people. Ants are not bright and are difficult to
train.

;)

BTW, congratulations! I don't quite understand why you had to drive so far
South to get married (the lady is not 13, is she?) -- maybe you had heard
that our heat was &quot;sultry&quot;, when it is actually &quot;oppressive&quot; -- but
congratulations all the same!
