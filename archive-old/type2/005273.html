All the ones I have seen/removed/replaced have been large hex head sheet
metal screws.


&gt;    Can anyone tell me the diameter of the bolts that hold on the pan under
&gt; the front of the bus.  You know, the pan under the pedal area.  Half of my
&gt; bolts broke when I took them out for the first time on this bus.  A 5mm
&gt; seems too small and a 6mm seems to big and none of the local flaps or
&gt; hardware stores have a 5.something mm bolt.  I guess I could tap out the
&gt; holes to a 6.  I'd rather stick with the proper size and the first step is
&gt; to find out what that size is.
&gt;   So if you know what the size is, how about sharing the info.
&gt; Thanks in advance for the help I'm sure will come my way.
