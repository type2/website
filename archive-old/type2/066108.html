Subject: [F] Re: Should 1982 bus steer straight?

&gt;Someone said all busses pull to the left - can
&gt;this be true? If not what would be the most likely cause?

Well, I think it's true quite a few bussers pull to the left.  I suspect the
cause is all that flat surface area on a bus suitable for plastering
McGovern, Greenpeace stickers, etc.  Of course there are also quite a few
bussers who pull to the right in which case all that extra cargo space in
the bus can used for concealing the deficit.

Oh, you said busses!  Well, busses themselves tend to be moderate, middle of
the road types.  Should track straight.
