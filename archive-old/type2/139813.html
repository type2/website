&gt; Guys,
&gt;
&gt; I've been thinking about the 70 amp alternator too and went and looked
&gt; yesterday at the autozone site.
&gt;
&gt; Autozone claims to have one...special order and all, but it is on their
&gt; web site.

find out if they also have the cooling boot, it is different shape than
the 55amp one.

&gt; So what's up with that?  Ron(BD) doesn't list one, but the bus-boys
&gt; do...are they &quot;really&quot; NLA, or am I just dreaming.....Think I'll call them
&gt; in a few minutes when they open and ask them.

let me know too,  there are no Auto Zones close but I know where one is,
get the part or order # if you can

Thanks
Bob
