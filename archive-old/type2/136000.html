Subject: RE: [T2]oil coming from dipstick ????

john i was speaking of the metal tube inside the fan shroud its self not the actual inside where the dipstick goes into the slide...
i bent the metal tube inside the shroud some when i was taking it apart for rebuild so my concerns were that there might? be a small hair line crack..in the tube that is attached to the shroud..&gt;?
just thought i would clear that up so that Dr tim has no worries about this ....LOL..
peace and love'

JB Weld? What would Dr. Tim say?
There must be a correct gasket or &quot;O&quot; ring for this application.
Is there a crankcase vent that goes to the intake, is it open or clogged
with oil/carbon?
I miss Doktor Tim's advice.
