Subject: '75 - '79 restricted gas filler - solved !!

So, nobody's got the 'birds beak' filler neck for you poor people with 
California FI buses that need a catalytic converter and the restrictor to 
get past the California inspection angels!?!?!?

Well, I thought Steve Dolan gave me the answer for your situation.  Until - 
- -  I came across this item in Bus-Boys site:

B.  211-201-551R  Gas Cap, Locking, Black, 1974 to 1979  $15.60

NOTE:  The 211-201-551R gas cap will only fit models with the stock filler.  
It will not fit if an aftermarket metal restrictor has been added.


Wow, is Bus Boys saying that there is an 'aftermarket metal restrictor' that 
can be added?!?!?

If so, why hasn't any of our special VW providers mentioned them??
