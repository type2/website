Subject: Installing/wiring amubulance fans

So I won this set of fans off a famous auction site:
http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;rd=1,1&amp;item=4553677079&amp;sspagename=STRK%3AMEWN%3AIT

I received them in the mail in about 10 days!

I am now looking for installation help.  I know that most sellers from Oz
will or will not send the air covers where these go.  Obviously this one
was without the covers.

The only thing needed to do to my covers is drill a hole for the wire and
procure a grommet, but, how do I mount the fans and how do I wire them?

The switch that came with the fans is a 2 speed switch with what appears
to be 3 terminals.  Each fan has two terminals.  So now, how do I connect
them together and get them installed?

Any help would be most appreciated!
