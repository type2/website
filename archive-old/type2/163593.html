Subject: Removing stubborn oil pump?

Subject says it all.  I'm trying to get the oilpump out of my engine
for a rebuild and it doesn't seem to want to budge.  I soaked the
whole thing in pb blaster, stuck my strongest screwdrivers behind the
&quot;ears&quot; and nothing.  Is it just one of those things that you have to
keep at and it'll eventually come loose or is there a trick I'm
missing?
And just to clarify, it's not moving at all.  It's not like it's
cocked too much or anything, I can't even get a fingernail between the
cover and the case.
And yes, all 4 nuts and washers are off (cuz I know someone will ask ;) )


Thanks in advance for the help
