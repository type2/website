I have owned my bus for two month, and during that time it pulled hard to
the right. I had the usual problems with trying to find someone who would do
an alignment (too old, don't do VWs, can't see any way to adjust camber
etc.) Today I talked to an independent tires and alignment guy who said he'd
at least tale a look. I swung the bus in front of a bay and explained again
that it pulled hard to the right. He said he would bet me $10 that it was
the right front tire. I had never heard that a tire could cause the pulling.
I asked him how he knew and he said he heard me pull up and that after 17
years of tires and alignments only, he could literally hear when a car was
out of alignment. I took his bet. He explained that what he intended to do
to diagnose the problem was switch the front tires, left to right, right to
left. He said he expected that the bus would now pull *left* or drive
straight. The tech took the car for a ride and when he returned he said only
one word. &quot;Tire&quot; The tires were rotated, front to back, back to front. He
charged me $25, and when I asked him about the $10 bet, he declined and with
a knowing twinkle in his eye said one word: &quot;Experience&quot; Guess I gained my
fair share today.
The bus tracks nearly perfectly now (slight pull to *left!*)
