Subject: fixin head studs???

hello all,
 I have a 1600 motor that runs real good, the only problem is that it has 2
pulled head studs, both are on the bottom of # 2 cylinder. I was thinking of
yanking the motor this weekend and repairing it  They are 8mm studs and as
far as i can tell the inserts are spinning in the case. any ideas as to the
best way to do this??
Thanks,
 Bryan
