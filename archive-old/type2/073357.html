&gt;Could anyone tell me where I might find info on installing/using a

&gt;from a particular club who were quite adept at doing this.  They built
&gt;some sort of bracket/mount and hung the unit through one of the front
&gt;door windows.  Air conditioning is a must for summer camping here in
&gt;Texas.

There were many of them at Busses by the Arch last year.  Some people use
the  cube-style ones but I like my Panasonic suitcase-style unit which
doesn't protrude outward as far.  Got it at Frys for under $200.  I didn't
have to build any frame at all to use it, although I will eventually for a
cleaner install.  I simply set it in the window frame and roll the window
up until the upper edge contacts the top of the window frame.  A bungee
cord from the door handle to the rain gutter keeps it from tilting outward,
and a two-by-four prop on the inside armrest keeps it snug.  It has pleated
covers which extend outwards from the sides to seal the window opening.
You will have to plumb the bottom of the unit to drain condensation.

This worked so well that in 100 degree heat we had to turn it down to keep
from shivering inside, although it does take a while to cool down.  It may
look goofy, but as you said it's a must for summer camping in the South.
