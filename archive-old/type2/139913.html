&gt; I'm attempting to fabricate both the Fuel-injection

&gt; hose mold built.  This &quot;S&quot; hose cloning project may be
&gt; for naught.  And the A-B Butylene material is way too
&gt; soft &amp; flimsy after curing.  i.e. haven't found
&gt; correct fab material yet.  But I will keep after it
&gt; part-time, and keep you all informed.

you get one to work, contact me I'm holding mine together with duct tape.
