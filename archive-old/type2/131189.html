Subject: VW vs Porsche Backyard Mechanic?

Hello,

I have been working on and off VW's for the last 20 years. I consider myself 
a &quot;qualified certified backyard mechanic&quot;, my friends agree that I am 
definitely &quot;certified&quot;. I am considering tinkering with Dr. F. Porsche's 
other car - the Porsche. My mind wants an early 911, but my wallet (and more 
importantly wife) says I should tone down my desire to a 914 or 924. No 
offence to those that have those vehicles -  but no thanks. So my compromise 
is the 912 (not the 1976 version). It looks like a 911, but has two less 
cylinders.

My question is to those that are fortunate enough to have two great air 
cooled cars. How easy or hard is it to work on the Porsche's compared to the 
VW? Are parts as available as the VW? Is the Porsche network as good as the 
VW one? Any other comments/advice?

Thanks in advance for help, Phil.
