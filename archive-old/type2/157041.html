Collects bugs!  Lots of nasty dried on bug guts to clean out of the nooks
and crannies of your bicycles

Consider a roof rack.  You still get a few bugs, but much fewer and your
bikes are a lot more secure.  Load and unload by standing in the sliding
door opening.  With door closed and locked, bikes are pretty much out of
reach of the Bad Guys.
