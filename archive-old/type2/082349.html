Go to any bodyshop supply that handes 3-M stuff----thet should be able
to order the stripes---

Or try any Marine supply---they have wide vinyl stripes available for
the water lines of yachts--

I got a quote on my 78 Champagen edition this 
weekend and am thinking seriously about doing it....The only problem he
has though, are the 3 stripes around the bottom of the bus. He says that
finding some that are as wide(about 2&quot;) as what the stock ones are is
going to be difficult. 
Go to one of the small time guys who cuts stripes and lettering for
business vehicles. It should be cheap and easy.
