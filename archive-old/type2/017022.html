So I'm driving down the road when all of the sudden, the engine stalls.
(Not that unusual and a cold, humid day).  Thinking that it is just a
little cold, I try to restart it, pumping the gas like I usually do,
only to flood it.  I checked everything and discovered that the
distributor rotor had shattered. I replaced the rotor and it stil
wouldn't start. Now I can smell the gas fumes incredibly strong. Wait a
while, still won't start.  Try some of my old tricks,  hold the
butterfly valve open with a screwdriver and try starting, no luck.  Try
starting fluid-it fires up but won't hold the idle.  Wait a couple of
hours, try starting again. Starts right up but sounds a little funny,
revs itself kind of high.  Drive home. On the way home, it won't hold an
idle, will start up but won't idle.  Next day, Starts up and idles but
only after initial start up, after it warms up it won't idle.  I set the
auto choke to full open and it won't run at idle at all, won't start,
nothing. Reset the choke to its correct position, start it up,  race
back to the back.  As long as I move the thingy-ma-bob by the throttle
lever that opens the butterfly, I can make it run fine. I don't know
much about carburetors, and can't figure this one out. This is my daily
driver, so to have it not quite functioning right is really a pain.  The
carb is a Solex 30 pict 2 with a Bosch OO9 dizzy on a 1600 Single port
any ideas would be helpful.
