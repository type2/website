Subject: '70 Cold Weather Problem -Timing?

Hey Volks!

It's been a little cold in the a.m. here in Boulder the last few days
and I have a small problem I need help with.  In the morning I have a
problem when shifting from any gear to the next one up in that it feels
like the engine is dragging...is this just 'cuz the old bus engine isn't
warmed up enough?  I let it warm up for about 5 mins before leaving my
place in the morning.  I only drive about 6 miles to work and it seems
to be okay by the time I'm pulling into the parking lot.  I go about
50-55mph for most of the distance after a few stoplights to start out.

It supposed to be warm this weekend so maybe a compression check and
timing and idle adjustments are needed?   According to Muir, I can do
timing without a strobe - is that the best way to do it?

Any help would be, well, helpful.  To quote Monty Python.

Mike
