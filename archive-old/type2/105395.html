Subject: Re: [T2] Has anyone seen plastic cap covers for 17mm lugnuts??

&gt; No but even Home Despot has PVC caps...

Thanks, Tony.  I wasn't sure if you meant the standard PVC caps, or
something in the specialty range.

&gt; Google &quot;Lucas tripod headlamps&quot;...

I thought that the tripod thing was internal to the lamps?  Is it on the
outside?

Might know of a source for those OEM caps though...
