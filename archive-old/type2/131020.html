Subject: Re: [T2] Timing Issues

Well theres a vacuum canister, so it must be the normal distributor.  I dont 
have a hose that fits the vacuum advance right now, so I have it plugged at 
the carb.  Should that make much of a difference at idle? I wouldnt think 
so.  Im gonna go attack all the intake connections, as suggested, with a can 
of WD-40 and see if the engine goes wild.
It was mentioned that the 009 should be timed at 7.5 advanced, but then that 
you should time for the engine, not the dist.  So should the regular be at 
7.5 advanced too?  The haynes says 5 after, which just seems odd to me.

Thanks again
-Tom
