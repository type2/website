&gt; It was somewhat rhetorical, but you answer is pretty much right on the
&gt; money.  I came across a magazine called &quot;Make&quot; http://makezine_dot_com/ that
&gt; is kind of like the olde skool Popular Mechanics when folks were
&gt; actually expected to build things.  Problem is, this magazine is mondo
&gt; expensive (like $10 an issue) so I doubt that it will be very widely read.

If you can find copies of the Brit mag, &quot;Practical Classics&quot;...It's in the
same
vein...Automotive restoration without leaving both the car and your platinum
Visa card at a shoppe... ;-)
