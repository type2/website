Subject: RE: Greeting Card

        I was recently browsing through the blank greeting cards at my local Barnes &amp; Noble. I 
happened upon a section of cards that were cars. It was cut out in the shape of the particular 
car. They had a Beetle and a 1965 Microbus. The following text was on the back:

        First imported into the US in 1958, the Volkswagen bus became very popular in the '60s and 
'70s. In 1968alone, 46,060 new buses were registered. Young people who travelled frequently and 
small business owners who needed an inexpensive vehicle to carry tools or supplies found it very 
convenient. Volkswagen marketed the microbus as a station wagon, the &quot;desirably different&quot; family 
car. It could carry twice the volume of the average wagon, handle a load of up to 1,632 pounds, and 
fit into a parking space four feet shorter than other station wagons could use. The minibus also 
featured Volkswagen's air-cooled engine and a 24 mpg gas consumption.

        Its light weight (2,904 pounds), height, and rear-mounted engine made the VW van very 
sensitive to cross winds, and its lethargic acceleration was also considered a safety hazard. 
Additionally, the microbus had virtually no front-end protection, with a &quot;crush distance&quot; of only 6 
inches, half that of similar vans. While Ralph Nader might have found fault with it, those who 
loved the bus, such as the flower children of the '60s, were faithful to it nonetheless.

Remember, if it's not Volkswagen, it's crap.
