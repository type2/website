Subject: poptop hold down straps..

I was just reading Fred Stoermer's article on poptop billowing again, and
I was wondering where you can get the straps he mentioned... I have
problems with my poptop lifting up on the highway since the interior
straps lose their grip... ive been to about half a dozen stores looking
for the luggage straps, and ive found lots of buckle tie downs, but all of
them have these huge hooks on the ends, and not the little loops that fit
nicely over rain gutters.  one of the guys at the local FLAPS said those
would be hard to find since not that many people strap things to their
roofs anymore......

any suggestions?  i have a nice set of straps (red to match the bus even)
but they have 2&quot; hooks on either end, which will not hang onto the rain
gutters.... or has anyone found a way to better latch the poptop from the
inside....

Thanks.
