&gt; I need to buy a new battery for our 71 bus.
&gt; 
&gt; My understanding is I should get a group 42.  In California cold cranking
&gt; amps might not be so important but reserve is.  Right?  How long a reserve
&gt; can I get?
&gt; 
&gt; Interstate 42-50 has a reserve of 71.  Napa NBR8442 has a reserve of  80.
&gt; Is this a significant difference?
&gt; 
&gt; Any other suggestions?

I use a group 24.  Larger, more reserve, fits in the same footprint, but
is a bit taller than the bug battery.  VW used group 42 batteries because
they already had them in the factory.  Group 24s are very common because
they were used in C*evys and a number of Japanese cars.

I also recommend that you put the battery in a plastic battery box to save
the battery tray.  Worth the hassle.
