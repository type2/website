Subject: Re: [T2] worn hydraulic lifters

argh.. are you serious?  eeeeek!  What would cause it to stop rotating?

Just for the sake of curiousity, can I resurface the lifters and put
them back in?  I could mill them smooth again..

&gt; Hate to be the bearer of bad news but........you have to replace that camshaft. It is history. The lobe is
&gt; wiped out. Why did it happen? Not sure. When it wipes the lifter like that, it means the lifter stopped
&gt; rotating.
