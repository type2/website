Subject: [T2] Re: regulator/ Answers from Bosch

I did some research thru Bosch USA, and as I suspected, the regulators are 
identical in function/construction except for the ammount of RF ( radio 
frequency) shielding. In other words, as the 70amp reg. is working harder( 
well, not really harder, it's just handling more transmitted EM energy than 
the 55amp reg.,) it puts out more electro-magnetic &quot;noise&quot;, and more 
shielding was added to keep it from bleeding thru to the sound system, CB, 
etc.,if so installed. But I figure that since the Type2 is nothing more than 
a big Faraday Cage anyway, it wont make too much difference to me. But as 
they say, Your Mileage May Vary.
