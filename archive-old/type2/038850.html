Subject: Push rod question?

The very last thing I need to do on my 71 Westy's new Hydraulic motor is cut 
and intall the pushrods.  They are 5/16th steel.  Has anyone ever cut steel 
pushrods and installed the tips before at home?  Is there a trick to getting 
all the lengths exactly equall?  What is the best way to push in the tips 
without a press?  I could have all these things done at my local machine 
shop(Rimco) but I'd love to turn this motor over this weekend instead of next 
weekend.

Thank you in advance,
