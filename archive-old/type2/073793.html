Subject: RE: [T2] lessons on the aftermarket

&gt; there's a recent shortage of prime passenger side scrapers off low mileage
&gt; buses so i caved in and used a wcm scraper to replace a less than adaquate
&gt; scraper i picked last week... and was i sorry. the aluminum is okay,
&gt; but the rubber is so sorrowful.... makes me glad i didn't buy it retail.


If you buy an outer door scraper from me (for about the same price as the
WCM one) you will get a genuine Volkswagen (Brazil) one, as opposed to the
aftermarket one that is sold by WCM, RMMW, and everyone else.  I used to
import them directly, and have now stockpiled them because VW has
discontinued them.  The overall quality is far better than the aftermarket
ones.  Also, the aftermarket ones are hit-or-miss in terms of fit (as often
as not, the clips are misaligned or prone to snapping), a problem not common
to the genuine ones.

Perhaps worth noting, however, is that this item is incredibly fragile when
off the vehicle, and prone to minor dings in shipping no matter how
carefully it's packed. In fact, I'd call one of the most difficult-to-ship
parts I sell (followed closely by Vanagon gas tanks, which UPS likes to turn
into pancakes in transit).  I generally ship them Priority Mail rather than
UPS to minimize the risk of damage, and usually any shipping damage is minor
(easily solved by bending the scraper back slightly or straightening a small
kink with a pair of pliers). But if you do get a mangled one, I do ship them
insured, so I can send a replacement at no cost.

Part numbers are 211 853 321B (left) or 211 853 322B (right). $34.95 each
(minus 5% listmember discount on request if part of a $50-plus order).
