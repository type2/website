Hi all,
I have decided to modify my plans to drive the Roadcow to Alaska from June
start date to July. It seems that those who have steady jobs ( I'm self
employed) will have an easier time of starting in July. Originally I was
going to try to do this in 2 weeks but now it looks like 3 to 4 weeks
depending on others wishes. I will be departing from Valley Springs, Ca.
near Sacramento and would like to drive most of the way ( I looked at the
Invuk sp? trip report and saw $800 ferry prices ) . Maybe we can break it up
into 2 groups to accommodate everyone's wishes. Please feel free to send
trip preparations, destinations, previous stories, and don't do's.
Thanks,
Britt
