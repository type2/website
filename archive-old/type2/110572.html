Subject: Re: [T2] carb cleaner

How long are you letting the parts soak in the
cleaner? I had a set that I let stay in the cleaner
over the weekend (almost 3 days). This removed the old
varnish. Make absolutely sure taht there are no ruber
or plastic pieces left in the parts to be cleaned. I
made that mistake once. :(

I used a Dremel tool with a wire brush to clean up the
outside of the carbs and to clean out the fuel
reservoir tanks inside the carbs. I was just careful
not to scratch up any sealing surgaces with it.

Good Luck and have a great day!

Regards,

David Kelly

&gt; So Im rebuilding my dellorto duals, and have a parts
&gt; cleaner bin with parts 
&gt; cleaner chemical which seems to be doing alright but
&gt; I can't seem to get some 
&gt; of the brownish antique baked on stuff off, is there
&gt; a chemical cleaner to 
&gt; buy that will bring these back to almost new metal
&gt; look. I did try carb 
&gt; cleaner from the local parts store but that does
&gt; about as much as the parts 
&gt; cleaner. thanks
