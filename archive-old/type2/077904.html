Richard,
Germany and surrounding countries have much colder weather than most of our
states and the VW engine, in it's original form, was designed to take that
in mind. If all the factory componets are on the engines and working order,
you should be able to start in frezing weather and drive where no man fears
to tread. Up here in the PNW we have mild winters and have to drive up to
the mountains for our snow, but the trusty VW engine doesn't balk once, if
properly maintained. In fact, that's the last thing I think of, getting heat
into the cab is the first thing! Having snow and ice packed around your heat
exchangers cools off the ol' temperature!

Richard,

You need to think *lots* bigger than dfroster wire....maybe 12volt water
pipe warmer type wire....lots of amperage draw probably.

And I don't think it would help much anyway...best bet is to fix the heat
riser part of the mainfold, or find a preheat tube and use it to feed
almost all of the intake air with nice heated air...but bad when the
weather warms up...

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi. I know that the correct way to fix carb icing is to find a manifold
with the heat riser tube open, have all the correct air cleaners and so on.
&gt; (This is a 1600 Single port with 009 and 30/31 carb)
&gt; I was wondering if there were any other solutions for someone who has no
garage and wants a temporary solution until it's warm and dry enough to do
it right. 
&gt;   One of my roommates and I were discussing using some of that heat-wire
for a rear window defroster and wrapping that around the manifold below the
carb where the ice is the worst. Any thoughts? Anyone who knows better who
will stop me before I do something stupid? (I would insulate it electrically
from the manifold) Any thoughts and assistance would be appreciated, as the
weather now has been rainy and ~40 degrees for a while, and doesn't look
like it's stopping any time soon.
&gt; thanks, 
&gt;
