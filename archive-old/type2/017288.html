Subject: Carb Air Preheat... lessons learned

A couple weeks ago I asked the list how to plumb the carb preheat system
in my '73 dual carb'd engine. My wife would categorize the following as
mental masturbation, but I hoped some of you might see it differently.
:)

While finishing and bench testing my engine, I played with the intake
air preheater. Two responses to my question on plumbing suggested that
the vacuum for this system comes off the balance tube on the right hand
side rubber elbow. I did find such an elbow documented (021 129 637D
instead of 637C, which has no port), but I don't have one, so I
connected into the vacuum tube on the idle circuit (the junction under
the air cleaner). Ran that line to the plastic fitting on the
thermostatic valve, the brass fitting I hosed over to the vacuum
operated damper. 

The thermostatic valve consists of a small plastic box with the brass &amp;
plastic connects coming out the bottom (although it sounds like there
are a couple different kinds... &lt; December '72 being different according
to Bentley). The box contains a bimetallic strip that applies pressure
to a check valve (nylon ball in a brass housing) in the top of the box.
The check valve is held closed when cold. When it opens, air is allowed
into the box, which creates a &quot;vacuum leak&quot;, as was theorized in a
previous post. I think the vacuum leak is regulated by the size of the
hole in the check valve, and that VW designed it into the system...
IMHO. 

During warmup, while the thermostatic valve is closed, the vacuum holds
the damper open and redirects air heated by the right head (assuming all
ductwork is installed) to the carbs. This is the case under all load
conditions throughout the warmup period with this late valve, according
to Bentley &amp; Haynes ('72 allows cool air under load). Preheated air
flows over the thermostatic valve on its way to the right carb. When it
is sufficiently warmed, the &quot;vacuum leak&quot; condition allows the damper to
start closing. 

This thermostatic valve can be adjusted, but my measurements indicated
that the valve starts letting in cool air when the intake air reached
about 112F to 113F degrees and the engine is revved. At about 115F it
doesn't take much throttle to open the damper all the way up.

I also noted that the lower section of the intake manifolds get quite
hot, but the upper part stays quite a bit cooler. I think it is still
warmer than the carb body, though, and is probably warming the carb
slightly. I suspect that this worked in conjunction with the preheat and
EGR to keep carb icing down, but I have very little experience with
these Type4 engines and dual carbs, and Utah is dry enough that I never
seem to have icing problems in my Type1 VWs with the preheat hooked up.

Hope this is useful to 2 or more people. :)
