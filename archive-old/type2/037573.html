Hi All
HELP! Does anyone out there have or know where I can get a stud remover
for stripped Type 4 round port exhaust studs. Three out of 4 aint bad
but the fourth broke off with about 3/4 &quot;
left sticking out. I have tried the hammer and penetrating oil tricks
but it still broke off. No regular stud puller will work, too large n
diameter. Please tell me that there is some way short of drilling it
out.
Thanks, O brilliant listees, Jack
