Would those be the turn signals or the air inlet?  I think there's enough 
curvature on the nose so that a side view of the bus would show the inlet.  

Another interesting note is that all the poptop drawings and pictures in the 
book show a smooth surface, not the ribbed like most of the Westies I've seen.

I'll try to scan and post the rest of manual in the near future.

&gt; I posted a scan of the cover of the 1968 (it says 1967) Westy Manual that
&gt; I have at: http://www.geocities_dot_com/thegreatjose/VW/68Westy.JPG &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; Interesting.  Notice the turn signals on this?  They're up by the air inlet
&gt; like the US 73 - 79 models, yet the poptop is front-hinged like the US early
&gt; bays.
