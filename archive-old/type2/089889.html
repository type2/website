&lt;&lt; Assuming you have the later 5x112 mm hub, then a certain Mercedes wheel 
will fit from the mail-order tire places for about $40 a wheel.

I've got the M-B 14 inch alloys on mine. If you get the year and model #'s
go for the recycler's and try for the 15 inch alloys for the same price or
a lot less. Looks great and you save a few lbs. per wheel in unsprung
weight...:-)
