Subject: Re: [T2] Please Help, trouble with #2's spark plug angle

I use a piece of hose,10&quot; or so, 3/8 inside diameter, stick it on the end of
the spark plug. I think plugs kind of point to the center of the engine or
there abouts. ( I think I read this some where ).

Subject: [T2] Please Help, trouble with #2's spark plug angle


&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I am having a rough time finding the right angle to install my spark
&gt; plug in the #2 cylinder of my Type 2 Westy (type 4 engine I think).
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone look at thiers and get back to me via email or advise if
&gt; they know?
&gt;
&gt; Had a whole day out there at -15C, lost my screw for the points
&gt; below the adjuster for the distributor, so I had to take the distributor
&gt; out to remove the plate which took a 1/2 drive cheater bar to get off
&gt; in this cold, then I lost the spark plug in the housing for the #2 spark
&gt; plug, two hours of fishing around for it with a flex magnet got that
&gt; out.
&gt;
&gt; So, I am very very tired.
&gt;
&gt; PLEASE SOMEONE HELP ME, BY SIMPLY LOOKING AT YOUR
&gt; OWN 1978 WESTY AND ADVISE ME OF THE ANGLE OF THAT
&gt; PLUG!
&gt;
&gt; Ohhh my aching frostbitten fingers.
&gt;
&gt; Can't find it in the shop manual, hayes or muir.
&gt;
&gt; With at least emotional warmth, your brother in VW's
&gt;
&gt;
