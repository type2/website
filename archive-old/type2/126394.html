That's for later, when the only available part (despite being labeled
&quot;All-American A-One Manufacturing Co.&quot;) actually turns out to have

Complaints to the service dept. will get you someone in Lahore who
knows nothing about parts and besides, All-American A-One Manu-
facturing Co. is really only a fax and answering machine in the Cay-
man Islands...
