Subject: Re: [T2] 2 liter valve adjust question

Hydraulic lifters require an initial adjustment, after which they do 
not require periodic adjustments. The procedure is covered in Haynes 
and Bentley, and is described in umpteen posts to the list, which can 
be found in the archives.

A smidgeon of non-bus content: my wife summited Mount Kilimanjaro on 
Monday. I am awful darned proud of her.
