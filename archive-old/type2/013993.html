AFAIK, these sheet metal parts (piston retaining plate) should be in
place in both the early and late brakes.  It is shown in Bentley, Brakes
and Wheels section, Figure 7-9 (item 6) and Figure 7-15.  the second
figure shows the proper position (it fits four ways, only one is correct)

My feeling is that proper piston orientation is important, either from a
wear or noise point of view.  Otherwise VW wouldn't have gone to the
trouble of making the plate and machining the piston to match.

The piston retaining plates may be a bit hard to find or there might be a
listee with a hundred of 'em!  The plates aren't really hard to fabricate,
as they are exactly the same shape as the brake pads.  The tricky part is
getting the pressed-out protrusions in the right places, for which you
will probably need an original to work from.  BTW, the plates under each
pad are mirror images of each other, which means that the protrusions are
pressed out of the opposite side of the plate.

Even on original plates, the protrusions are often pressed back flush with
their holes when the plates are improperly installed.  You can just press
'em back out and it's just like new!
