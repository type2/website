&gt;&gt; Does anyone know of any cleaner or chemical I can use on my fiberglass
camper van top to make it look white again. It is very dirty and nothing
seems to work. &lt;&lt;

Go to your Benjamin Moore paint dealer or http://www.WestMarine_dot_com under
Boat Maintenance and get fiberglass/boat cleaner.  I can't remember the
brand name I got from B.M. (3m or Meguiars or something) but it works great
and comes in a 1 quart bottle that looks like a small Prestone jug.  In case
you don't know, Prestone is this hideous green fluid that some lesser
vehicles need to keep their engines from over heating.  =)
