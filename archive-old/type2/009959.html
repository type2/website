Subject: Glue under the vinyl trim
Message-Id: &lt;199906241346.GAA14173_at_helix.ucsd_dot_edu&gt;

I am trying to remove the glue that was under the vinyl trim on my 1976. 
There are two kinds of glue involved. One kind, which holds the felt pads 
in the rear, responds well to mineral spirits. The other kind responds to 
almost nothing I have tried, which includes:

- mineral spirits (paint thinner)
- carb spray
- kerosene
- charcoal starter fluid
- Coleman gas
- citrus goo remover

rubbing alcohol has some effect

The glue responds to heat, but it is difficult to get adequate heat at 
the area without damaging window seals, etc.

So what haven't I thought off?

TIA
