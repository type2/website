Subject: 68 DC For Sale

I regret to list my DC for sale but other projects take priority ( flame
suit on) . It has a 71 front disc. beam on it with matching drums at the
rear. Visually from the outside it looks like a 71. The body is freshly
painted white and this is a Calif. bus that did have rust in the passenger
rocker. I cut it out and replaced the 3&quot;X6&quot; section with good German metal
(donated by my 68 squareback) and painted the bus. It is about a 5' paint
job (looks good from 5') but if you look closely you can see some of my
poorer body work. It was a work truck and the gates I left alone so they
have many dents in them and are slightly bowed out in the middle ( about 1&quot;)
. The bus is a daily driver with current licensee. It has a rebuilt 1600 Sp
in it (universal case I think). The interior is average with the seats in
very good shape. It needs the rear door panel replaced and the vents on the
dash are broken. The steering box is shot and needs to be replaced. Tires
are about 75% left. The van comes with a spare 78 transaxle with axles,
aluminum side step and various bus parts. The exhaust is a dual
quietpack,other than that it is stock. I'm located in Calif. 50 miles south
of Sacramento.
Price is $3800 cash or $2000 and trade for a Rabbit Convert or Scirocco16V
