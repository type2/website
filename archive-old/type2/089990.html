&lt;&lt; Saw a blurb about a new Pertronix unit for AC VWs the other day.  Called 
the &quot;Pertronix II&quot;, and claiming improvements of ~200-400% over the 
performance of the original.


Anybody have any experience with one of these new systems?

 &gt;&gt;

200-400% improvement = what ?
Did the ad give specifics as to what these improvements were? Seems like a
pretty broad claim unless they were comparing their's to, say, no ignition...
