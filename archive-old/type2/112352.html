Subject: Re; Thought's of Air Shocks

John,
The air shocks are a good concept, but put a big load on the weak frame
shock mounts--

And---you also have to find longer mounting bolts for the lower
mount--which really adds to the leverage factor on them treaded inserts
in the frame--

Get the torsion bars adjusted---
It's a better deal in the long run.

I found this out the hard way.

Later,

Terry

Hey Y'all,
I have been scouring the archives this morning looking for info on rear
shocks. Here's my deal: My 71 westy has a very SLIGHT rear sag, not
really a problem until I load it up with a few hundred pounds of camping
gear and children, then it is a pretty noticeable sag and the rear just
feels &quot;heavy&quot; when driving it in these conditions. Last summer I
attempted a torsion bar adjustment, the more I started unbolting stuff,
the more confused I got trying to follow the Bentley directions for the
procedure. I actually got one torsion plate off and couldn't get it back
on for awhile, it finally went back on and only by a miracle did it line
up where I started with it. So, to avaoid any further messing up, I
quit.
I was considering coil overs so I went to the archives and found another
option: Adjustable air shocks from Napa part #MA758.
  If I could get a little lift that would be great, but I am more
concerned with the load-carrying aspect. Whaddya think, will these help
me out?
