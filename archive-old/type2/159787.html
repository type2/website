Subject: Re: [T2] which is better?

I think some of us might be getting confused between the 5-rib 002 trans 
and the 6-rib 091 trans.  Here are some easily-verifiable facts:

3-rib 002 Trans from '73 bus has 5.375 final drive and .82 4th gear = 
4.4075 overall highway gearing.

5-rib 002 Trans from late '74-75 bus has 4.86 final drive and .889 4th = 
4.318 overall highway gearing.  That's a 2% difference or &quot;Virtually 
identical&quot;.

6-rib 091 Trans from 76-up bus with 2.0 engine has 4.57 final drive and 
.889 4th = 4.064 overall highway gearing.  That's substantially &quot;taller&quot; 
than either of the above 002 transaxles.

The original post asked for a comparison between the two 002 transaxles 
listed above, not any 091 transaxle.  I stand by my statement that on 
the highway the three and five-rib 002 have virtually identical gearing, 
with the five-rib being ever-so-slightly taller (about 1mph faster at 
60mph).

&gt; I beg to differ ... I went from an early to a late (091) trans in my '74 for
&gt; one main reason: bring down RPMs on the highway and it does just that. 
&gt; 
&gt; In 4th at 4000 RPM it is difference of 10 km/h (or about 6.5 mph): 108
&gt; (68-73 trans) vs. 117 (76-79 trans).
