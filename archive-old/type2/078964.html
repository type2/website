Subject: 78 gas tank job pics now up

Folks,

The pictures of the gas tank removal job I did yesterday on my 78
are now up.

http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/78bustankjob/index.html

To all of those that replied with hints about this job thanks!
To all of those that warned me when I got this bus and it had 
been sitting for 8 years, and said pull the tank first, my apologies.

I should have done it last summer....let that be a warning to the rest
of you....look at picture #12 to see part of what was in the tank.
This one apparently had a full tank of gas when it was parked.  What you
see is what happens to gas after sitting for 8 years.  The tank looks
&quot;ok&quot; inside except that there is still a lot of this stuck to it inside.
This is *after* it sat for 3 weeks last summer with a gallon of lacquer
thinner in it....and it still looked like this.


several questions...

Picture #2 shows the mustache bar support on the passenger side.
It looks like the bar is too short, but the bracket appears to be
factory...why would they do this?

Pic #3 shows a ball bearing that was just laying where you see it...any
ideas where it came from??

Sorry about the size of the pictures, but I squeezed them in half...tried
to keep the quality good, and the size reasonable.

Now to find someone to &quot;boil&quot; the tank out and recoat it inside.  I know
when I'm &quot;beat&quot; on this deal...it's time for the &quot;pro's&quot; on this
one.  Anyone had any good luck with this sort of thing at the radiator
shops?....What kind of cost?  Did they do a good job?

Cheers, dave
