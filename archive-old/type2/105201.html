Subject: Re: [T2] How do you turn a tight engine

At 10:25 PM 3/19/2003, you wrote:

&gt;Leonard said that it was perfectly normal: as long as the starter
&gt;could turn the engine, it was okay and that I was worried for nothing.

He may be right - motors are a bit tighter at first until they &quot;break in&quot;.  If the starter can turn the engine, you most likely have a glazed belt or your belt is too loose.  Does the starter turn the motor quickly, or just barely?  That might be a clue.


&gt;When I asked how I could turn the engine to adjust the valves at 1500
&gt;miles (AVP warranty requirements), he suggested tightening the
&gt;alternator belt and/or using gascacinch to make the alternator belt
&gt;more &quot;grippy&quot; so that rotating the alternator would rotate the engine
&gt;(that does not work now).

I always push down on the belt between the alternator and fan while I am turning (watch your fingers).  This tightens the belt and helps it turn the engine if it's at a point where it's more difficult to move (such as near the top of a compression stroke).

&gt;Now, according to several people I talked to, including the local VW
&gt;shop, a tight engine like that is a precursor to overheating and an
&gt;engine failure.

Only if it's abnormally tight.  This could be caused by off-center bearing bores, bearings that are not matched to the journals of the crank/rods/cam, or other abnormal mechanical interference.

&gt;Any ideas what I should do?

Find someone near you that knows how tight the engine should feel.  Have them try to turn your engine and see what they think.
