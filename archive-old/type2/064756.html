Subject: '71-'72 Caliper Bolts

Hi folks,

I stopped by my local VW dealer to order the upper and lower bolts and
washers that hold the front caliper to the steering knuckle on '71-'72
buses.  The part #s are:

Lower bolts: 211 615 141
Upper bolts: N 010 127 4
Spring Washers: N 012 232 3

Apparently the only items available were the spring washers, the bolts are
NLA.  The 1973-up bolts are still available but they are larger for the
larger calipers (the upper bolts alone are $4.50 each from the dealer!!).

I'm wondering if anyone out there has a source for these.  I could just hunt
down the same grade/thread bolt at a hardware store, but the originals have
an unthreaded shaft near the hex head to better hold the caliper in place.
Anyone order these from somewhere lately?

Thanks,

Ron
