You should try the same trip in a split!!!

I have actually been stopped by a policeman during strong winds who wanted 
to find out if i was drunk or not....hehe....while driving my 67 in the 
middle of a cold front that was coming in...40mph+ side winds and gusting.

Cheers ,dave

&gt; &gt;Yes, I have the correct pressures according to both the steering &gt;column decal and Bentley.
&gt; 
&gt; But also, you said you were running at 50 psi, which, as mentioned, is too high.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;If there is &gt;much of a wind at all, I'll arrive at my destination &gt;with sore shoulders and arms (even if the trip is just 2 hours).
&gt; 
&gt; That's cuz you're driving a sail.
