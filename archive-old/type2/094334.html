&gt; Better not drive on it unless you have a cell phone and the number of a tow

OK, done.

&gt; This is why it is sooooo important to have CV's and rear wheel bearings
&gt; greased the first thing when you buy a bus and then NO MORE than 25,000 on
&gt; the CV's and 40,000 on the rear wheel bearings before greasing again.  Any
&gt; kind of tears in the boots will shorten the life of the CV's.

My bus was abused all it's life and it's currently going through the
everything original is wearing out phase.  I saw the crack but it tore
before I find the time to take care of it.
 
&gt; I hope this didn't sound like a chewing out, just trying to make the point
&gt; that so many people overlook, or just plain don't do.

Not at all.
