Subject: Re: [T2] 70 speedo adjustment?

The '70 owner's manual specs 7.00x14 tires. Seven inches is 177.8
millimeters. 

The aspect ratio of those tires was about 92.
(See the Yokohama and Tirerack tire-info sites:
 http://www.yokohamatire_dot_com/04a1a.html and
http://www.tirerack_dot_com/tires/tiretech/general/size_conversion.htm )

So a 7.00x14 tire with an aspect ratio of 92 tire converts to 178/92-14.

Now, using the purely mathematical conversion gimmick found here --
http://www.powerdog_dot_com/tiresize.cgi -- compare the stock 178/92-14 tire
with your 195/70-14. It's about 8% smaller than the original tire, and your
speedo is about 8% off.

Even the 185/82-14 tire VW went to in mid-'71 is smaller than the 7.00x14.
And VW didn't change the speedometer calibration to compensate for the
smaller tire.

More info can be found all over the type2 library and archives. Here's one
good link: http://www.type2_dot_com/library/tires/kabayo.html
