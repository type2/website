&gt; ok, i was told a while ago, that you need to turn the drums when you
&gt; replace the shoes or the grooves will wear the new shoes out faster...
&gt; true? or not?

Somewhat true, if the grooves are deep.  If the wear is even, no problem.
be sure to have the drums measured to see if they are within wear limits.
No sense turning drums just to find that you have made them too thin!

&gt; then, more recently, i was told that it would be difficult to get the
&gt; drum over the new shoes if i dont get them turned because of the depth of
&gt; the lip...

Not true.  The shoes are made to fit within the lip, which is after all
the diameter of a new drum.

 if the lip isnt too bad, then it isnt as big a problem... true
&gt; or not? and at like $100 each, i cant afford to buy new ones...

Are the splined drums _that_ much more than the composite drums?  Wow!
