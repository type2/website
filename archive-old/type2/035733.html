Subject: Re: 34 PDSIT -2/3 adjustments

&gt;       I basically have a new motor,  rebuilt the carbs, including having
&gt;the throttle plates rebushed. I run an electric fuel pump set at 2 psi . I
&gt;adjusted the volume control screws 2 1/2 turns, have given the idle mixture
&gt;screw 2 turns out  and I think I have adjusted the throttle valve opening
&gt;properly, maybe. ( On page 15 of the Fuel section in Bentley, they refer to
&gt;a closing gap in figure 5-11. Am I wrong to assume that this &quot;gap&quot; is the
&gt;distance from the throttle valve  to the edge of the throttle plate? Because
&gt;I measured that gap with a straight edge and set my gap on my 2 carbs this
&gt;way).  I syncronized the 2 carbs so they both flow equally.
&gt;
&gt;The questions...
&gt;
&gt;1. As previously stated, why do plugs 3&amp;4 get sooted up while plugs 1&amp;2
&gt;remain clean, even though I have both carbs supposedly set-up the same way?

Sounds like 3&amp;4 are misfiring.

&gt;2. What screws should I adjust?

You are on the right track by adjusting the volume control and idle mixture
screws.  You need to do more than simply set them a specific number of
turns though.

&gt;3. Is 2 psi on my fuel line too high or too low?

2 psi is fine.

&gt;4. Have I set-up  my throttle valves properly? If not, what should I do?

Not sure what you mean by throttle valve.  The gap I'm thinking of is
between the throttle plate and the throttle body.  This one is not critical
to a smooth idle  - the important thing is that the carbs are adjusted
identically.  To adjust this gap you need to remove the carbs.

&gt;5. I didn't replace the floats when I rebuilt the carbs (mainly because no
&gt;one locally had them - not part of the kit). They both had a slight
&gt;indentation where the needle valve contacts it. Is this enough to keep the
&gt;valve open, and thus, flood the carb?

Doubtful.

&gt;6. While I'm at it, what's the proper gap for the exhaust valve - .006 or
&gt;.008?

That is a subject of much debate.  Before I went to hydraulics I set mine
to .008, because too loose is better than too tight where valve lash is
concerned, and .008 was not any noisier that I could detect.

&gt;It also idles a little rough and backfires every now and then,
&gt;especially when you let the throttle off.

You need to determine the cause of the rough idle.  First, do a compression
test.  Don't assume that because your motor is &quot;new&quot; that the compression
is okay.  If that checks out, do the wire-pull test.  Are all cylinders
contributing to the idle an equal amount?  If 3 and 4 don't pass this test,
turn the volume control screw on the left carb out (counterclockwise)
slowly.  Did the idle smooth out?  If not, turn it back in until the idle
drops, then out 3/4 turn and leave it alone.  Do the plug pull test again.
Then adjust the idle mixture screw for smoothest idle.  If that didn't
help, you need to check for vacuum leaks on the left side.  Problem areas
are manifold-to-head junction and carb-to-throttle-body junction.  Pull and
plug your brake booster hose if you have doubts about it's integrity.  If
still no improvement, it's probably time to disassemble the left carb and
blow out all of the passages with compressed air, especially the ones
associated with the idle circuit.  And how could I forget?  The idle jet
solenoids!  If you have them, check for proper operation by removing the
power from them one at a time while the engine is running.  The rpms should
drop drastically.  If not, you've found your problem.

Last but not least, are all of your jets sized identically between the
carbs?  I don't think this would be enough to cause the plugs to blacken
but it is still important.  There were several sizes available in the three
years the carbs were used in the US so it's prudent to check them.
