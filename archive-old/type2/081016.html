Subject: Re: [T2] Corvair engine PS

And the ones who will tell you the Corvair engine isn't as reliable as the
VW (especially a VW in a bus) are full of it.  That should have been THE
engine to put in a bus.

Subject: [T2] Corvair engine


&gt; I was given a 1966 Corvair, the body needs a lot of work, but the engine
&gt; runs fine. Would it be possible to install this engine in my 71 Westy? If
it
&gt; is possible, how hard would it be? Thanks in advance for any replies,
&gt;
&gt; Victor
