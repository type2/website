&gt; Another signal, not used much any more, is to blink out your lights to 
&gt; oncoming trucks when there's trouble ahead... usually in the form of a 
&gt; trouper sitting in wait.
&gt; 

Actually, I saw (and employed!) this particular headlight usage quite often
back in Vermont... never see it out here in Oregon, though.  Troopers,
accident, large snow drift (more serious than it sounds!) -- all good
reasons to flicker the headlights.

'Course, then, there's also the blared high-beams (rather than a horn --
mine didn't work anyway...&lt;--VW Content!!!) for the jerk who cuts you off. 
But then, that's not really &quot;Courtesy 101,&quot; now is it?
