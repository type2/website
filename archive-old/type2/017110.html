Subject: '74 Westy for sale

Hi all!

Unfortunately, I have to sell my Westy. I've been refurbishing my ghia
and it's costing more than anticipated.
The Westy is orange, has some nose damage, new tires, registered in CA 
till Sept.(has smog equipment), new canvas pop-top, child's cot.
It runs good. Does probably need carb work cause it stalls when cold and
coming to a stop. It came with 2 extra carbs. Don't know what shape
they're in, but they'll go with it.
I live in So. Cal and am asking $1700.

Thanks,

Tina
