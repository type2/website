Subject: Fuel Pump

Is there any benefit to switching from the stock fuel pump to a electrical 
fuel pump with a pressure regulator?  If so, is it OK to just disconnect the 
stock pump and not remove it?  THANKS  1600dp

PS- Is it an easy do it yourself job to install a pointless ignition, and 
same question in regards to a deep sump.

Thanks,
Matt
