Subject: ECU price

I found a 79 at a local Junk yard and pulled some spare parts -switches,
sliding door parts ..... one other thing I pulled was the ECU. The guy
wanted $50 for it - so I passed. Should I have bought it? What are they
worth. Also is compatibility a problem? My Buss VIN starts with 2291 and so
does this bus.
