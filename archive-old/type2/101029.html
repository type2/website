&gt; Can someone please briefly explain
&gt; the difference between
&gt; type 2 and type 4?

one of VW's quirks 
&gt; 
&gt; I have a 76 2.0 liter.
&gt;  what is it? 2 or 4?
&gt; or 1, 3, 5   ???

car types
   type 1  = beetle
   type 2  = ALL buses
   type 3  = a bigger version of the beetle engine with pancake fan and
more traditional body styles
   type 4  = VW's last gasp with trying to make a stylish aircooled
vehicle (sold in the USA as 411 or 412 in 71-74)
all things are type 1  most Karmen Ghias are type 1  some Ghias' are type
3 (Very different body style, not imported into the USA although some grey
markets appear)  all Westy's are type 2

now body variants

the splity was a type 1
the Bay was a type 2
the Vanagon was a type 3
and the Eurovan is a type 4 


engines

up until 1972 all bus engines were a modified type 1 engine
after that all USA buses were a variation of the engine found in the 411
or 412 VW,s   a variation of this engine is also used in some 914 Porsches

VW never referred to the 411/412 engine in the bus as a type 4 that is a
user designation that has stuck

confused yet???

so my 1978 bus is a 

type 2, body type 2, with a type 4 style engine

your 76 would most likely be the same
