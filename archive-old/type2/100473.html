Subject: MPH &amp; SPM (sec per mile)

My wife asked 'Barry, why do you have this stopwatch in the car'?

I told her, it was 1/2 of my speedometer.

I showed her the second half, a strip of 2&quot; x 8&quot; laminated printout that has 
two columns; column one says MPH, and, downward, it goes from 75 to 40, 
column two says Seconds, and, downward, it goes from 48.0 to 90.0.

I simply get to a steady speed on the highway, and measure the seconds 
elapsed between mile posts.  Then I glance to the strip and read the Seconds 
column, and the matching MPH.  Then I know my over-the-road MPH.

What's more frightening, I find more use for this system on my non-VW type 2 
vehicles.


Weird, right??
