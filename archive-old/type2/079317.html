Subject: RE: [T2] Paint Question

This is completely true.  If you use POR-15, you either have to sand it to rough up the surface, or use their special primer.  I chose to use the special primer.  It actually works very well, and have used it over the whole body of my bus.  It acts like a build-up type of primer, and wet-sands really well.

&gt;I am not sure what kind of stuff that POR 15 has in it, but it is not a rust
&gt;converter. It basically creates a non-porous covering over the rust or metal
&gt;and prevents anymore moisture from entering and causing rust. The problem
&gt;with the POR 15 is that you are not supposed to paint directly over it. Some
&gt;people have had luck with it by sanding it some. POR 15 recommends that you
&gt;use their special primer to paint over the POR 15, then use regular paint
&gt;over the primer. Are the spots that are spider webbing in the same area as
&gt;the POR 15? It could be that the new paint or primer is not getting good
&gt;adhesion to the POR 15. Some people that have painted over POR 15 could
&gt;probably respond and tell how they got the paint to adhere.
