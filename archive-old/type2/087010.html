&gt; This question is why the answer ''always time your engine to the distributor
&gt; you have and not your engine&quot; has to be said over and over again until
&gt; everyone understands it!

Well sort of!  if you read in the archives the long, long discussion I and
Steve Dolan and a few others had about a year ago it turns out that it is
much more complicated than just &quot;tune to dist&quot; especially on the FI
engines with the ECUs and a few other &quot;complications&quot; that add to
things.  probably Tune to dist would get you started but the best bet is
Always use the stock dist if at all possibl/e

&gt; 
&gt; Timing your engine 'by the book' at 10 after is only true IF you are using
&gt; distributor # 021 905 205J or 021 905 205N  AND you have vacuum at idle
&gt; connected to the retard side AND you are timing it with a light at idle.
&gt; 
&gt; Timing a mechanical only dist at 10 after severely retards the engine. Get the
&gt; correct dist, the correct book [Bentley], and the correct information. The
&gt; Muir book is fun to read when you get your 1st type1 engine but it is nothing
&gt; more than comic book for a typeIV engine.
&gt; 
&gt; All Bosch distributors have the numbers around the outside of the body. Some
&gt; are easier to see than others. You don't need the Bentley to get the specs for
&gt; it. Go here if you know the application:

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Last week I posted a question about timing my bus.
&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, I lied to you all. What I thought
&gt; &gt; was a stock distributor is really a mechanical advance one (I can't
&gt; &gt; find my Bentley right now and I don't know where the part number is
&gt; &gt; marked, so I'm not sure exactly which one I have.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyway, I timed it by feel last week, as my timing light was not working.
&gt; &gt; Today I got the timing light working and checked it. To recap, I timed
&gt; &gt; it by advancing it to max RPM at idle, then backed it off 4 degrees.
&gt; &gt; I've been driving it gently since then, and it's been doing fine.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Today I checked it and it was advanced 20 degrees at idle (900rpm).
&gt; &gt; I retarded it to 10 ATDC per Muir and then the old problems came back --
&gt; &gt; rough idle after it warms up and almost no power (0-60 took over
&gt; &gt; a minute where it used to take about 25 seconds, and it maxes out at just
&gt; &gt; over 60MPH on flats, 50-55 going over overpasses.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This didn't seem right to me at all, so I advanced it to TDC at idle.
&gt; &gt; I checked it at 3000 RPM and it's advanced 24 degrees. Power is back
&gt; &gt; and it idles fine when warm nows, but I'm back to wondering if this
&gt; &gt; is good for the engine or not. Does that advance curve sound scary?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I do have a stock distributor on my spare engine, and will probably
&gt; &gt; install that soon, but in the meantime I need to drive to Portland
&gt; &gt; tomorrow (120 miles each way) and would rather not blow up the engine
&gt; &gt; in the process. Opinions?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Oh, the engine is a 1.8l, dual carb, manual tranny.
