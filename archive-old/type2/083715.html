&gt; &gt;What we call &quot;vacuum advance&quot; distributors are't really advancing with

&gt; Not correct as I understand it.  I was guilty at one time of believing the
&gt; above but Karl convinced me otherwise.  Here is the truth:
&gt;
&gt; 1.  Manifold vacuum is the ultimate source of vacuum advance. **
&gt; 2.  Vacuum created by the venturi effect has no significant effect on
&gt; vacuum advance.
&gt; 3.  At WOT (wide open throttle), measured vacuum advance *and* manifold
&gt; vacuum will both go to ZERO.
&gt;
&gt; Take a carb apart sometime and look, get a vacuum gauge and test, you will
&gt; see it's true.

I think that we're describing the same thing in different ways, a common
problem in my profession.

The important thing is :

throttle closed, no vacuum
partial throttle, big vacuum
WOT throttle, not much vacuum

Whether you think of it as being transfer of vacuum from the manifold past
the butterfly or as vacuum due to Bernoulli at the signal port it
still works the same.
