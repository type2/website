Hello i'm from NH and the frosty mornings have spond me to buy a catalytic 
heater but i can't find the mr. heater's anywhere, can someone let me know 
where to find one. This afternoon i picked the coleman heater but it doesn't 
seem very well consructed or safe.                                            
    Thanks, Jay
