Subject: Airconditioner on a '74 Bus.

Hi again list,

	I apologize for writing so often with questions, but I have a lot
of questions. :)

	There is a non-functional air-conditioner in my '74 VW Bus.  Since
I really don't care to have air-conditioning anyway - I like the blowing
wind in my face - I would like to remove it and put a sun roof in.

	So, my question is this ... would I compromise any part of my
bus if I removed it?  I know there is a section in the left part of the
engine &quot;cabinet&quot;, and that there are electrical connections throughout ...
but if I remove them all, I shouldn't suffer from it, right?

	If anyone else has done this before, I would love to hear about
what you did and any problems you had.  Thanks guys.

	Wade
