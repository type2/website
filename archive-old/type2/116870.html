Subject: Re: [T2] brake job

&gt;Question two: Do I really need any special tools to do
&gt;the rear drum brakes, or can I get by without buying
&gt;special tools?

Not sure if your drums are exactly like mine, I have a 71. But the hardest 
hurdle is getting the axle nuts off, they make a special thingy that fits it 
and you can use a breaker bar to get it off. I was unable to get it off, so 
i had my mechanic zap it loose with an impact wrench and then i was able to 
get it off finally.
