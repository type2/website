Subject:  Re: [T2] Today i started the bus, and it didn't like me at all

New exhaust gaskets, between the head and exhaust manifold will smoke on 
first startup.  I'm figuring you didn't let it run long because the leaky 
oil cooler. It might even be oil dripping on the exhaust from the leaky oil 
cooler. Also the smoke from the exhaust usually seems to dissipate within a 
few minutes after a fresh engine rebuild.
Just some ideas to consider

&gt;So, I just put on my new head, and it went together pretty well without 
&gt;pulling the engine.  Also gave it new plug wires, and a couple other little 
&gt;things, like viton tube seals and a cv boot.
&gt;
&gt;    Started it up, and it was loud and smokey, but that was to be expected, 
&gt;i thought.  Two things... one, my oil cooler leaks like a faucet.  The 
&gt;other is that it won't drop idle, and it smokes smokes smokes.  Oil in the 
&gt;exhaust smoke, it is.
