&gt; Hi all,
&gt; Earlier this week I posted a response to Barry's question about setting
&gt; dwell in which I stated that a VW distributor is driven off the camshaft.  I
&gt; don't know what kind of crack I was smoking, but that is NOT the case.  In
&gt; the VW engine, the distributor is driven off the crankshaft, which is why it
&gt; spins clockwise like the engine.

Since the distrbutor is driven by spiral gears, the direction of the
distributor is determined by the design of the gears, not the direction of
the crankshaft.  VW probably just figured that clockwise was easier to
remember.
