Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust studs for the people

&gt;at the suggestion of a list member i checked out maryland metrics
&gt;www.mdmetric_dot_com  they have not replied to my query but they will make
&gt;custom studs to order as the 9 mm 8 mm studs are impossible to find

Uh, I bought 12 of em at the spring Manassas bugout from a local vendor
(don't recall who) for $1.25 each, German studs.  Several vendors had them.
Not exactly impossible to find.  Not as easy as the 8/10's but not hard.
