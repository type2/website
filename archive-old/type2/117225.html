Subject: [T2] Oil Pump Studs Length and so much more...

I have been following your oil pump saga. What pump have you decided to get
and what are the modifications that you will
have to do?

I have ordered a pump, gaskets, and new machined coverplate from John at
Aircooled_dot_net. When I ordered an email was sent detailing the modifications
that would need to be done to ensure the pump would be compatable with my
web-cam with bolt on gear. I felt that I was going to have to modify either
the melling or the schadek and the schadek was half the price and was
aluminum for what thats worth. Oh and the &quot;sales_at_busdepot_dot_com&quot; has not yet
responded to my questions about whether or not the melling was a direct
replacement or not... No big deal I was pretty set on the schadek anyway.
Now I plan to drop the motor and do the pump plus install a cooler since I
like to tow a small boat (at 70mph) a lot in the summer and would prefer to
keep the temps down. Still need to get the oil thermostat for winter.

I bought this heat shield thingie from Pattis Parts Palace in CA. It showed
up yesterday and it is supposed to bolt on to the bottom of the tin above
the muffler but I have not figured that out for the life of me. I at first
thought I was getting the piece that bolts to the bottom of the bumper but
I guess thats just a gravel guard or something. Anyway the heat shield is
prety cool looking and I think has some  nice asbestos inside , I just wish
I knew how to install it.

Oh and I discovered my 12v water pump does not work. PO had it installed
and it looked great. But then he butchered the wiring for the aux battery
so I never got to test it out. Last month I sorted out all that wiring and
got the fridge and everything else working. I was fooling around last kight
and noticed that I had juice to the pump but no pumping. Took it apart and
a lot of rust fell out... Bus Depot has a nice looking plastic one for $25,
so I guess I'll be getting that.

I also noticed some pinholes in part of my muffler which I suppose will be
done by year end. I have a 78' with the 78' heat exchangers and all of that
stuff is in good shape I just need to replace the muffler. Does anyone have
personal experience with the replacement mufflers that eliminate the cat? I
have seen one I think at Bus Depot and there is one at Bus Boys. It just
bolts to the heat exchangers and has a little egr hook up port on the left.
Thats whats on there now and it looks like it held up well over time. I
just don't know where the PO got it from. Was thinking of coating the new
one with POR 20, anyone do that yet?
