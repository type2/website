Subject: Re: icebox/sink combo

&gt;What is a fair price to offer for a Westy icebox/sink unit? It comes out 
&gt;a 71 and is in decent shape. I have a 69 Westy, but the PO tossed the said
&gt;unit, because &quot;it was too difficult to get around it to get in&quot;. The guy
&gt;saved a beat up, badly bent, bumper mounted, spare tire rack, but didn't
&gt;save a piece of the original interior - go figure.
&gt;
&gt;

I'd say $50-75 would be a good price. They're not all that rare.  I have 
one, missing the small pop-out table on the side and a handle, which I'm 
selling for $40 here in Pa.
