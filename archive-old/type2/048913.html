Subject: [T2] slip on front seat covers

Has anyone tried out slip on front bucket covers for a 71 westy or similar?.  
It appears they are available from JC whitney, and bus depot carries them as 
well.  I'm wondering what they look like, and how close colors match if they 
do. (My current seats are offf white)

thanks 
Don
