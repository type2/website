&gt; Now I need new tires and wheels. The old wheels are in terrible, rusty

mechanic
&gt; said to get 6&quot; radials. I think this is referring to the tire, and
not the
&gt; wheel, right? 
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I'm very very open to suggestions about what the best
tire/wheel
&gt; setup would be.

The best wheels are probably the ones you have right now.  Unless they
are corroded to the point where there is question of structural
soundness, will clean up just fine.  If you're planning to keep them
for some time, have them sandblasted and powder coated.

As for tires, the optimum choice is 185R14, load range C or D.  Tire
stores don't tend to stock this size and will want to sell you
195-75R14s, but stick to your guns and have them order 185R14s for
you. Bridgestone (Firestone dealers) and Yokohama make this size and
load range.
