Subject: Re: [T2] They're here, 55 through 72 front mats

I'm with Jake on this one, as many who know me are
aware of my dislike of the NB, and all that it
represents.

What I find particularly amusing is that VWoA spends
enormous amounts of money trying to create an
aftermarket industry and a &quot;culture&quot; around the NB's,
and either bullies or ignores a ready-made culture
they would not have to create - but merely support. If
VWoA put half the money into the ACVW hobby as they do
trying to create an NB hobby, they would have amongst
the largest constituency of loyal owners of any
marque.

&gt; 
&gt; I would pay 100 bucks to be able to pound some sense
&gt; into their skulls
&gt; concerning what they are doing to OUR industry.
&gt; 
&gt; Needless to say, I will never own one of their new

&gt; cruise in a Horse drawn buggy first.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;   One of the reasons there are no part numbers is
&gt; because one of my
&gt; &gt; importer/manufacturers has been fined $65,000.00
&gt; by VWoA, even though a
&gt; lot
&gt; &gt; of his product was imported from Germany, Mexico
&gt; and Brazil and was
&gt; &gt; authorized VW but not for export to the U S A.
&gt; VWoA is very anal and is
&gt; &gt; doing nothing else but hurting this industry. I
&gt; could go on and on but we
&gt; &gt; have all heard it and the list has allready been
&gt; there on this subject.

&gt; &gt; Is this because of VWOA? I think that is
&gt; ridiculous,
&gt; &gt; if they have a problem with the repo stuff, maybe
&gt; they
&gt; &gt; should get in the business.

&gt; &gt; Not defending all/any VWOA decisions, but they are
&gt; &gt; just protecting their copyright. It's just easier
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; deny use across the board rather than by
&gt; individual
&gt; &gt; case. If they didn't, it could start a precedent
&gt; with
&gt; &gt; a company (ala GEX) offering VW-logo pot metal
&gt; &gt; pistons...
&gt; &gt; On a similar note, Rolls Royce sued an aftermarket
&gt; &gt; company for selling fiberglass Beetle &quot;hoods/bon-
&gt; &gt; ets&quot; with the RR grill.
&gt; &gt; ...And Harley-Davidson tried to copyright the &quot;po-
&gt; &gt; tato, potato&quot; sound of their twins...
