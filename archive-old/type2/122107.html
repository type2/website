Subject: RE: [T2] CO gauge for FI setup

Greg,

Also I would suggest that before you install your FI system, bench check 
every component for proper function (as much as possible). After 
installation &amp; prior to startup meter out the entire system at the FI 
harness plug to the ECU. I assume you're using some used parts...I can 
almost promise that you'll find some part or some connection that's not 
right.

Unless your FI harness is pristine, I'd also do a continuity check on all 
it's connectors prior to insatll; the Bentley book has a diagram showing 
what goes where.

Have Fun,
RickG
