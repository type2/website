Subject: Rear Brake Job Complete

Hi All,

Just finished my rear brake job, the parking brake now holds Pumpkin II from
rolling backwards down our really mean hill...I guess that's what it's
supposed to do, huh?   :0)

I replaced the brake hoses and a parking brake cable as well, and greased
the rear bearings. I need to retract my earlier statement about not removing
the bearing housing; I got it all apart with the housing still attached, but
I couldn't get the inner bearing back in from the inside...no room to pound.
So both housings came off, and the whole process was easier on the second
wheel since I removed the housing first on that one. The breaker bar I
bought for the axle nut made short work of the four big bolts on the
housing.

Two glitches related to parts...BD sent me the kit for an early bay...the
springs are similar, but don't quite fit...luckily I found the right kit at
a local place the same day. I live downtown, and can't leave vehicles on
jacks for more than a few hours...

One of my drums was torn up, so I got two new ones locally
(aftermarket)...but then couldn't adjust one wheel, it was dragging like the
drum was out of round. Turned out that the hole in the drum where the hub
sticks through was a hair too small, so the drum wasn't on all the
way...dremel-tool fixed that real quick.

The info in the Library was great; Bentley is confusing at best.
