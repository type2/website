&gt;  Something I've wondered about the propane conversions is why mount the tank
&gt; inside the cab?

&gt; Since you'd only use gas to start, then switch over to propane I'd assume
&gt; you could ramove the stock tank and install a small two or three gallon one,
&gt; then you could mount the propane tank next to it.

get one or two long narrow tanks and mount them on the roof
