&gt; I would not blame any rebuilder for this.  I expect to have to do this
&gt; adjustment on any newly studded head.
&gt;


I disagree.

If I was building the engine myself, sure. If I'm dropping over a grand on
an engine, I refuse to deal with stuff like that. If it's such a simple
adjustment, it should be done by the builder.

But that's ok. I don't have a grand to drop on an engine anyway. ;)
