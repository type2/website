&gt;As I recall back in the mid 70's when there were a lot of these engines

&gt;was of a slightly different design than it is today.  As I remember it,
&gt;rather than two &quot;squared off&quot; sides as they seem to be today, one side
&gt;was more rounded, kinda like a half circle (but not quite).  That
&gt;slightly rounded side was on the top and the squared off side (which was
&gt;shiny) faced the bottom.

Yes!!!  My original seal was like that.  The first time I replaced it I was not at all excited about the blocky look of the top part of the new seal, but I got used to it.  :(
