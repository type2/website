I think what Ken is saying is that maybe the Pandora project should have
been to locate a KG and not a split type2 &lt;grin&gt;.

Beat your chests if you like but the coachwork on the later buses is much
better than this. I love splitties but these doors were tacked together by
people who either didn't care or didn't have time to care. None of these
door bits bear any evidence of primer, they have one very thin coat of
paint shot over bare metal--which might explain the not-surface rust.
