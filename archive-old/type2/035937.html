Subject: Westy Manual Online and online tutor still sought

List

I just read the JustKampers chat site and found an interesting post for
Westy owners. This chap has put up scanned images of his 1972 westy manual.
Cool piccies and interesting text on how the stuff should work :0)
Check it out at www_dot_campercrew.cwc_dot_net/projectwestphalia.html

Oh BTW still searching for a virtual welding tutor. Anyone there??
