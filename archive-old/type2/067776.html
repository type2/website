Subject: Help with purchase of engine stand

Talked to a guy who is unloading an engine stand.  He said it is portable
and that he used to work on type 4 bus engines and transmissions with
it. Also has a box of Type one junk.  $50 each. Would it be worth it to
purchase an engine stand for $40 to $50.  He said there was a
progressive carberator for a type 1 in the box of &quot;junk.&quot;  I am only familar
with fuel injected stuff so would it be a good grab while I m there.

Thanks for the help
