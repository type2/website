Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Dead mouse removal?

No, no, no, I got it.  Just get a snake &amp; let'er loose in the tube.  If the 
snake gets hungry enough its sure to eat the snake, assuming it can't escape 
of course.  It's fool proof.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Any suggestions for getting the bugger out?
&gt;
&gt;Just a warning, remember a year or so ago when others had this problem?  At
&gt;that time people warned of certain diseases or germs that the mouse nests 
&gt;and
&gt;bodies carried.  I would be concerned about this if your bus is any where 
&gt;near
&gt;air tight.  Fortunately mine isn't even close.  It only sucks in the
&gt;winter.....:(
