Subject: Re: Vanagon collectability...


&gt; Seems I'm the only one that thinks &quot;Vanagons&quot; will be sought after
&gt;in a few years. Bizarre- there are lots of them around- I've seen
&gt;quite a few already with body kits and alloy wheels etc.

Won't be able to afford to fix the aircooled ones insofar as they are
different from the bays, they only had a 3.5 year run here. I gather there
was a Caravelle with an upright 1.6 in countries where they speak proper
English, is that right? What a very slow lummox it must be but at least you
could get parts for it. A California Vanagon exhaust would be worth more
than both my buses combined if you could procure one.
