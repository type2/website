Subject: sudden oil leak - RESOLVED

fellow listmembers...

So, the sudden oil leak right around the left heater box WAS just the valve 
cover gasket. The pushrod tube seals still need to be done, as there are 
still the little drips here or there, but the massive one is corrected at 
least.

Contemplating doing the pertronix electronic ignition install soon, anyone 
have a BAD experience with them? Ive heard from those that say you don't 
really need to, and those that say its been great - any bad luck with it?

Ol jasper aint runnin like he has in the past still, and trying to recover 
from the recent 3600 trip. Im just going to keep fixing what I can, when I 
can and hopefully everything will perk back up.
