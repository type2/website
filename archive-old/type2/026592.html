X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Ian:

This is a warning light that is telling you the brake fluid pressure in your
master cylinder is not balanced correctly between the front circuit and the
rear circuit.

That little round &quot;B&quot; light on my dash is acting up. Though I am not sure if
it's just a short or if there's something really wrong with my bus.
Regardless,
I would really like to know what the heck this light is for... please?
Anyone?

thanks,
ian - '72 Kombi

To me, it's always a good idea to always
carry two sacks of something when you
walk around. That way, if anybody says,
&quot;Hey, can you give me a hand?,&quot; you can
say, &quot;Sorry, got these sacks.&quot;
