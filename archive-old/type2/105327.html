Subject: Throttle body gasket, The Great Search

Hello List,

I have a little problem. I just ordered a throttle
body gasket from Bus Depot. I talked to them the other
day and they said that it would probably have to be
deleted from my order because he didn't think any more
were available. I am hoping he will be able to locate
one for me but if isn't able to, do you know where I
can find a new one? 

Pelican Parts has one for a Porsche 914 Item
#022-133-073A. (for a 74-75 1.8L Porsche 914). Here is
a picture of the gasket.

Does anyone have any experience with these gaskets and
could they work on a late model bus F.I.? I think I am
running out of options. Thanks and have a great day!

Regards,

David Kelly
