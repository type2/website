Subject: [T2] Lady in Michigan wants bus info

Rock on!  I'm acquiring a '76 camper from a friend who doesn't have the time
or energy to do around $1000 of work on it.  I'm also planning a 6 month
cross-country trip in it come spring.  I'm sure I'll be in touch with the
list via laptop...especially if I run into any problems.

Speaking of which...does anyone have a good recommendation list of
tools/supplies I should take with me...for repairs, complications and the
like?  You never know what the road will bringeth!

Thanks in advance!

Missy:)
