Volks,

Look!  Up on the web!  It's a bird!  It's a plane!  no... its a bird :-)

Actually, that is your assignment, should you decide to accept it...

The picture of this week's mystery bit will be posted at

at 2100 EST (9:00 PM, east coast time :-)

Good luck!  As usual:
 o answers should be sent to this address, not the list; and
 o the answer and the names of those responding correctly will be posted
   about an hour later.  

                           H Steven Dolan
