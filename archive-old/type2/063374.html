Subject: ANYONE IN AUSTIN?

Morning all...

My brother's flying to Austin, TX this Wednesday to visit a friend. He wants to 
try to visit any good junkyards that may have VW stuff for our almost finished 
'71 Westy. Maybe meet up with anyone in the area who may be selling parts. (We 
need fridge/sink unit parts, driver side rear window w/vent, and other 
miscellaneous thingys.)

CAN ANYONE HELP US OUT?

THANKS!!!
