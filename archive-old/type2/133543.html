&gt; Wrong tool for the job. Get yourself a $50 angle-grinder, or borrow or

&gt; floor should take 15 minutes, tops. 11000 RPMS makes things happen a
&gt; lot quicker.

and a BIGGER 7 inch one is even better and faster, if a bit more $$$

&gt; If you're working inside the bus with an angle grinder be sure to wear
&gt; ear plugs.

and goggles and dust mask
