	Forgive my lack of knowledge here but this bus is my first vehicle
and my first real experience with auto mechanics.  Anyway, recently I have
developed and oil leak from the left side of the engine, it drips down of
the low part of the case on the left side.  I thought this was probalby
due to a leaking oil cooler but after removing the left side cooling tin
under the bus I discovered that it was leaking from a bolt in the case.
It's located in a recess right between and a little below the 4 valve stem
tubes.  So I figured the bolt was a little loose and I could just tighten
it a tad and that would be it.  Well I tried to tighten it but the thing
just turns without going in or coming out.  I thought maybe there was a
nut on the other side of the engine that I had to hold but I can't find
one anywhere.  After searching the archives I found several mentions of
oil gallery plugs that are just pressed in.  Is this one of those?  Did my
trying to tighten it just make it more loose?  Any thoughts or advice
would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance
