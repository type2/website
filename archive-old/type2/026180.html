Its good to hear from someone who has recently been successful.  I got a
certificate for my '70 (Gordon) last year but since then have heard from
various people who got negative responses talking about the fragile nature
of the fiche.  I think the key thing is that money talks.  I sent more cash
than was required and got very prompt response.  The money goes to the
museum, not VW, so its a good cause.  Whatever you do, don't expect any
results over the internet.  Send a letter and cash for results.

&gt; Hi Adam,
&gt; 
&gt; The birth certificate service by Volkswagen is also for busses available.
&gt; I
&gt; applied late march and received my certificate early april. So they are
&gt; really fast. Okay I live in the Netherlands so its quicker then mail to
&gt; and
&gt; from the USA but they respond quick.
&gt; By sending in your VIN number youreceive various information about how and
&gt; when your bus left the factory.
&gt; 
&gt; Here is a link telling more about it: http://www.ploon.nl/ and choose in
&gt; the
&gt; bottom menu VIN INFO.
