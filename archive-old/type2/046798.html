Hmmn as I've owned them all...

Well this is subjective from a number of standpoints.  Hands
down the '89 is the most advanced, has heat, and the 2.1
wasserboxer with a 4 spd is pretty much a real car.  Slow,
but not like any sort of &quot;real&quot; VW Bus.  Frankly the 2.0 is way,
WAY underpowered for the '80-'83 Vanagon IF you need to climb
any sort of grades whatsoever.  In reality it is occasionally hard
pressed to make even slightly higher rises on interstate grades
in 4th without falling off from 65mph.  However on the flat land,
you can cruise it all day long at 70mph.  For about 85-100k miles.
Damn near all the aircooled Vanagons I've seen or bought (owned
3, looked at 20+) have had a seat sink between those mileages.
That's what you get out of a 2.0 in the Vanagon driving at todays
interstate speeds.  And you regularly run oil temps around 220-230
(not that I consider those excessive.)

Fit and finish are much the same all years, '82 and later is nicer as
the tacky (it is in a Vanagon) woodgrain is gone, and the A/C units
and some interior finish improve with later waterboxers but the
equipment and layout is the same for all years and is very marginally
nicer than what I consider the optimal bus layout ('76-'79.)  Only
better in the gas fridge and slightly larger interior.  BA6's are more
common in Vanagons than Buses as well.

Reliability, well I've owned a score of sub $1000 Vanagon, '81, '81,
'83, '85, '87, and a nice '86, and '90.  The newer you get, things are
obviously newer.  But you get more systems as well, A/C, P/S,
etc, etc.  Let alone power options.  More stuff to break.  Engine
wise you will be looking at heads for the waterboxer between 75-150k
depending solely on the luck of the porosity of the casting (despite
what hand wavers, and coolant changers would like to believe.)  The
air cooled you replace at 85-100k, so sort of a wash, but generally the
bottom end is going to last better in the waterbox.  T4 bottom ends
(cam and lifters mostly) are not that stable despite their solid reputation,
in a bus 150+ in a van, damn unlikely.  But coolant hoses are really
needing replaced in even the newest waterboxers ($1000) and maybe
P/S parts, etc. etc.  Either way I've driven most of those sub $1000
Vanagons 15-25k more miles without problem and sold em on to
somebody else.

In the end, if you like air cooled cars, stay air cooled, but they are slow.
Automatic trannies make them even more so.  If you want functionality
more like a &quot;real car&quot; think about a waterboxer.  Maintainence on all
the similar parts, FI, brakes, shocks, suspension, will be the same $
roughly.  The things that get added to a waterboxer cost when they
go, but there are lots of junk vans around now days.  To camp in there
is no real difference.  And of course the newer you get the cleaner the
inside and outside are likely to be.  A full engine is about the same for
either from a reputable source, trannies cost the same, it is really only
coolant system, and P/S system that add to a waterboxer and that is
marginally offset by heater boxes and the fact that air cooled parts are
getting a bit more scarce already.

Something else to consider is that 2.0 air cooled, 1.9 waterboxers, and
even up to '86 or '87 2.1's all have about the same value for nice vans, say
$4-6k or so if you look hard enough, a bit cheaper for an air cooled, a bit
more for an '87 but you could go buy a fair example of any in that range if
you look and wait (around the WV, MD, DC, VA, PA, OH, areas at least.)
Buy the nicest van you can afford, and using common sense inspect all
of them mechanically carefully, and pay specific attention to trouble spots
typical to the specific models.  For the money today air cooleds or 1.9's
are hard to beat with nice examples needing engines showing up sub
$1000 with solid bodies and clean interiors.  The ideal way to buy IMHO
as you get to know the engine is new and quality yourself.

Oh to sum it all up, even though I just bought a mint '82 with only 80k
miles on it, I'm looking to get back into a '76-'79 Bus instead, what
does that say?

 A vanagon just isn't a bus, even with that gas fridge, sure it drives
nicer, but it isn't a bus.
