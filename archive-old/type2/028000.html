Subject: Frying wires: Alternator and Voltage Regulator
Message-ID: &lt;HGFIEMJLEKNKAAAA_at_theglobe_dot_com&gt;

Engine's in...more or less ready for first fire...with some exceptions as noted below:

I sat trying to drain my battery today in an effort to pump up oil pressure. Coil wire removed; no gas in bus. I paused after 20 or 30 seconds and went around to check things. I noticed a smell in the back and felt the alternator wires to the regulator. They were getting warm. I should have paid more attention, but I was anxious to spread oil through the engine, so I went back and turned her over some more. This time when I returned to the back of the bus, I found a plume of smoke and some clearly fried wires between the alternator and regulator. Hmmm...this looks suspiciously like the wires i pulled out of the cargo bay when I bought the bus.

Doh! Did I put the old '72 regulator (which could well have been bad) in there and fry the alternator wiring harness that came with this 77 engine? I think I did.

Anyway, assuming the wiring was properly hooked up, which I think is a pretty safe bet, should I suspect the regulator in this scenario...or the alternator.

I did notice before I connected the battery that I was getting some resistance from the big wire going from the alternator to terminal 50 on the starter. I figured I had a failing alternator, but I didn't think I'd fry anything by trying to pump up the oil; I just figured I wouldn't get a charge. (Hey, I lived in Arkansas for about 6 years. I don't claim to be too bright.) I also never got a generator light, even though I know i had that hooked up right and the bulb is good--ran a lead from the back to the front to make sure the right wire was plugged in even.

In all honesty, this is a bus full of unknowns. It sat for 10-12 years in a junkyard and it came with a totally disassembled 1700 in the cargo bay. I bought and rebuilt a 2 liter for it. I'll be pretty happy if I can get by with replacing an alternator and even a regulator. Might even give me an excuse to try to get a higher-output alternator instead of the 55 amp.

Should I be concerned with possibly having damaged anything else given this scenario?

Thanks! Joe

PS Felt really good just listening to that engine roll over, even knowing I wouldn't fire her up today. I've got a feeling I'm really going to like this bus!
