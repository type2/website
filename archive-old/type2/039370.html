Subject: last chance!!! Ambulance Fans for trade!!!

Ok I have posted this before but I will try one last time before I just
install them in my crewcab and find a cash seller of a middle seat.
I have a set of 68-79 ambulance fans that I want to trade for a middle seat
for my 63 samba
The fans work great with the covers and gaskets.
---These are the ones that install in the duct work below the dash--
Believe it or not these are suppose to be rarer than the split window bus
Ambulance fans.
I'll give it until next Saturday....Any Takers???
Sorry only a correct style seat considered. No vanogen, bay window, ch*%y or
?? type please.

Shawn
