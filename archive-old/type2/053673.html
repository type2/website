&gt;       I am going to look at my first camper tomorrow.  It is a 76 Westy.  
The
&gt;  owner says it has a sink &amp; a ice box but no stove or fridge.  Is this
&gt;  correct?  Are there different levels of equipment in different Westies?  I
&gt;  have had many buses but never a camper.  Any advice or suggestions would be
&gt;  appreciated.

Sorry I missed it, and I hope you found a car you like!

Yes, there's different levels of vehicle - the 3 that come to mind right now 
are the westy std. no poptop, westy standard poptop, and westy deluxe (with 
the stove and propane setup ( now illegal to fill, or so I'm told :~(   )and 
fridge (that takes a lot of faith and battery to work &lt;grin&gt;) and the table 
and hammock (and hassock/campstool/parts box) and a fire extinguisher (for 
the propane setup).  There are other variations, and there are also other 
camper conversion manufacturers other than Westy (Dormobile comes to mind)... 
Sounds like a Std. Westy.
