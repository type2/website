Subject: Loose Axle nut. Other weird noises
MIME-version: 1.0

&gt;I was looking into some strange noises that my '77 camper
has
&gt;been making recently and found that the 46mm castellated nut on the
&gt;left rear wheel was loose- it was held in place by the split pin but I   
    

could
&gt;move it with my fingers.
&gt; Can I just tighten this up and forget about it or should I be digging   
    

deeper?


Hi William

It just so happens that with winter coming on the garage work is
increasing and as I have removed every nut bolt and bearing from our bus   
    

theres plenty to do. Right now I am rebulding the O/S rear hub assembly   
    

and can give you a bit of info.
Firstly lets see how this system works, you have got a drive shaft
connected via a cv joint to a stub axle which is splined to the hub which   
    

holds the roadwheel. Ok this has got the rotation from the gearbox to the   
    

wheel, now we need to find a way of fixing this to the bus. This is done   
    

by the bearing housing which contains two bearings separated by a spacer   
    

with a sealat each end. The inner bearing is a ball bearing that can take   
    

axial as well as lateral loads, the outer is a roller bearing that is
taking most of the 'weight' and other lateral loads. The outer races of   
    

these two bearings need to be fixed to the housing which is easy, they
are an interference fit and need to be pressed in. As an offshoot, you
can use a BFH but I prefer a SFH and a suitably sized drift using
appropriate hits. Now the important bit, the inner races, these need to   
    

be an close tolerance fit to the stub shaft, ideally again it would be
rather nice to press the stub shaft into the assembled housing but
careful use of an appropriately sized hitting device is an alternative.   
    

When the stub shaft is far enough through to allow the fitting of the big   
    

nut it can be drawn through using the nut. The reason the nut needs to be   
    

so tight is because it would be virtually impossible to assemble the stub   
    

shaft into the bearing housing if it were an interference fit so the idea   
    

is to 'clamp' the inner races and the spacer between the stub shaft and   
    

the hub so the big nut needs to be &amp;***%&amp;* tight to prevent the stub
shaft spinning inside the inner races. If by any chance the stub shaft
does spin the noise would be sort of grindy and the spacer may (almost
certainly will) wear.
My advice would be to strip the hub and replace the bearings and the
spacer. If you need any more help mail me direct.
The humming, in my experience is a wheel bearing in the early stages of   
    

failure, they can last for years in this state but can also fail with a   
    

nanoseconds worth of notice. Due to your original 'loose nut' problem I   
    

would diagnose a rear inner bearing wearing due to the inner race being   
    

allowed to 'float'.
Oh and while I'm here don't be tight with the grease, bearings have a
memory and pay back if you don't put enough in!!

Well thats my 2p's worth
