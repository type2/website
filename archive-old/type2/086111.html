Subject: Bay Kick and Door Panels

 
--Hal et al:

I'm not in Seattle, but I am restoring the 79 deluxe con sunroof right now and have all my panels out. I plan to:

1. Trace them on to reproduceable sheets (blueprints for all!)
2. Draft them up for other CAD dorks like myself. (.dwg)

I have all panels including the kicks and the coveted rear cargo area.

Someone who needs this service should chime in to get me motivated.

Billy
