Subject: 81 hesitation solved

For the second time ever Mama slips behind the wheel of the camper to run an
errand and just like the first time calls me 15 minutes later from the side
of the road. We had rented the movie &quot;Powder&quot; last night and both of us were
begining to think that she was giving off strange electrical emissions(when
she called I was trying to trouble shoot a short in my car that she last
drove). 

I met up with her under the I-85 overpass and hopped in the car, started it
up and drove right off. She was flabbergasted and made me pull off in a
parking lot and change places. She couldn't make it go! Then it dawned on me
what was common between these episodes and my own 2 or 3 when trying to
quickly turn across a road. Each time we had tried to accelerate too fast and
the system for whatever reason failed to respond. I was able to duplicate the
effect just by stepping on the gas hard from idle. I suspect it has something
to do with the automatic as well as the fuel injection system. In any event,
the failure to makepower only happens in gear and from idle under a heavy
pedal, never while under way.

I reminded her that since it is a vw, there's little gained from goosing it
although a soft pedal runs against her grain. She finished her errand without
further incident and is relieved to know she's not haunted...

Thanks,

Weston
