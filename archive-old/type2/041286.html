Subject: Re: copper exhaust nuts

Alright, you've all piqued my interest here, given me the locations where I
can purchase the correct metric copper exhaust nuts, now, I was hoping
someone could give me the correct size for these nuts.  I need the nuts fit
the studs holding the heater boxes to the head itself.  I have '79 cal spec
square port heads. The originals were a self locking version which used a
metal locking mechanism on the end of the nut.
