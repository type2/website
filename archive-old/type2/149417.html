Subject: RE: [T2] drive-away tent

Hi, Shaggy . . ..

I know of at least two versions of the tent you are considering, if you will 
go down to 1968.  One version has a better frame, and is noticeable in 
pictures by the BLACK plastic knob / turnscrews on the poles.  Also, the 
base of these poles has a larger plastic foot ending in a point thqt digs 
into the dirt.  The lighter weight frames simply have a cap on the end of 
the feet so the dirt doesn't dig up into the legs.

You should at least offer $25 MORE for the heavier framed tent.


On a scale of 1 - 10, where 10 is truely NOS, and 9 is a perfect tent but 
has been set up at least once in camping, and a 5 is a ___     You get the 
idea.  'Great condition' is too subject a term.


If it's all there and not torn up, it is worth to someone about $350.  
Higher as it gets closer to NOS ($700) or perfect ($650), lower as parts are 
missing. That is my opinion on the value.  You may pay more or less, 
depending on the relationship you have with that friend....
