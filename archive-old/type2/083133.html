Subject: Re: [T2] different octane- different timing

I don't see how. Octane is simply a measurement of how gas resists
detonation. Here was a decent history on octane I found.

http://www.geocities_dot_com/motorcity/lane/1970/octane1.html

Now I can see you having to adjust your timing if your running low
octane fuel (knocks easier) and you keep hearing knocking. I suspect
this has more do to w/ the engine condition than the fuel, but you
really don't want that engine to knock.

&gt; hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; my pops tells me that if want to use a higher octane
&gt; feul then you need to re-time your engine accordingly.
&gt; as different octanes burn at different speeds. what im
&gt; wondering is, does anyone know the different timing
&gt; positions for all the different feuls. the only one i
&gt; know is (76 Type IV Engine) 7.5 BTDC. which octane
&gt; does this refer to? as always any answers, opinions,
&gt; or insights will be greatly appreciated!!
