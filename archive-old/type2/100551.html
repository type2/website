Subject: Parking break hook up

My parking brake is not hooked up is anyone familiar with how to hook this 
up that could drop me a line. Its frustrating holding the clutch in and 
trying to start the car drifting as your doing it. I am new to this late 
model bus and I tryinging to do the mechanical stuff myself.

Thanks Casey
