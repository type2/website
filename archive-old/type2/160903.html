Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Only idles with choke closed

Yeah it is a mystery to me too. I suppose something could get stuck
inside the idle passage.. rust? What else might cause one of these
carbs to not work? I would ove to get old leaky (nickname for my
current working carb) swapped out, but its the only carb I have (of 4
total) that seems to idle correctly. Hmm, maybe the leaks are what
makes it work, guess I hadn't considered that until now.

&gt; I hope others have a different experience and can help you.
&gt; Who knows?
