&gt;Tonight I remembered a hint from the
&gt;type 2 list about using paraffin and worked so easy it was amazing. Heated
&gt;those suckers up and applied wax till it stopped melting. ALL frozen nuts
&gt;came off with no effort at all. Amazing! I used bowl wax that is made to seal
&gt;your toilet to the plumbing in the floor. Available at any hardware store for
&gt;about $1.00. Highly recommended. Warning - is flammable (like a candle) and
&gt;messy to clean up.

Amazing - 26 years of service plumbing and at least as many tinkering with cars
and this is the first I've heard of using toidy wax as a penetrant.

Another &quot;better living through plumbing&quot; tip for freeing *heavily* rusted
fasteners,
pipe fittings and etc. is soldering flux.  Apply.   Heat.  Repeat as
necessary.  The preferred brand is Laco - it's some of the more agressive
flux out there.  Flux is nasty and pretty caustic, especially after
heating. Clean all remnants up.  I can't recall the last time I used this
trick on car parts.........should work though.
