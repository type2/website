Subject: Fuel Injector Plastic Tip

Hello.

I am re-doing some fuel injectors on my '78 and I want to replace the 
plastic tip that covers the injector.

Any suggestions?  -what are they called; is there any major supplier of FI 
rebuild kits?? (I don't want the kit, just the plastic tip.)

I am Northern Virginia challenged.

TIA
