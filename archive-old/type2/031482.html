&gt; I just bout a '77 Riviera camper, they guy i bought it from didn't know
&gt; much about it (much to my advantage). He said the previous owner blew the
&gt; motor driving over the continental divide and had it towed to the nearest vw
&gt; repair man where the current engine was put in. He says its a porche
&gt; engine. It is a type IV motor, but the dip stick is not where it's suppose
&gt; to be. It goes straight up and right next to the oil fill, which i don't

this is where the dip stick is if it were from a 914 Porsche, and ALSO on
a 411/412 sedan/fastback.  411/412 station wagen had rear dipstick like
bus. 

&gt; Does anyone have an engine like this? Is it from a 914? If so could
&gt; someone please please measure from the top of the dip stick down to where
&gt; the full and low mark are and let me know what they are. 

what is the engine code????

Bob
