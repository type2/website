Hi scott,
I just got through fixing this problem in my 66 panel. Differnet year bus,
but just about the same fix.
What I found out was that there was sooo much rust in the pivot area under
the bus that it did not want to move. I grabbed my propane torch heated up
the area and then doused it with &quot;Liquid Wrench&quot; or you could use &quot;WD-40&quot;.
Work outside cause that stuff stinks when it vaporises. Move the pedal a
whole bunch and squrit more WD-40. Repeat the process till the stuff
draining off the spring and seams is no longer brown and icky looking.
You should notice a slight difference in the pedal.
Next take an oil squirt can and douse all of the pivot seams with motor oil.
push on the pedal a whole bunch more. You should notice it will begin to
free up more. Repeat the process till it feels free.
A few days of regular operation and the pedal should work the rest of the
oil in the joints and become smoother. You can try to smear some axel grease
into the seams to make it a little more greased up.
Give it a try.

&gt;Hey all,
&gt;
&gt;I've noticed when using the brakes on my '71 that the pedal doesn't want
&gt;to return fully without an assist from my toe. Anyone run across this
&gt;problem or have an idea what to look for?
