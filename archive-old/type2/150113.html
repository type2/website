Karen, watch Craigslist for sure - that's where I've seen lots of
busses, here in the Seattle area anyway.  I found a '73 Westy in Boise,
which is much like a '71 - the camper part, anyway:

Here's a '71 Sunroof camper (not pop-top) in Seattle:

And a '69 Weekender (not pop-top):

This one you might like!

There are a few more on Seattle Craigslist, but I think I've posted
enough links.

 I'm looking to get a 68 or 69 camper style, with a pop-top if possible
in the boise area. I've seen some trick ones as old as '63. I want an
older style, up to '71, HAS to be camper-style though.
