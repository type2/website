Subject: Complete Restoration Shop

Hey Bob --

You know you are talking big bucks?  Probably more than the cost of a
new Jetta?

I owned an autobody shop some years ago, and we took restoration work
as filler for the times when collision repair work was slow; but I
only accepted work from friends in the Jag and Ferrari clubs.  You
will find the degree of competence varies greatly, with the best shops
concentrating on customers with deep pockets.  Unless you are willing
to open your checkbook weekly on a step-by-step agreed basis, you
shouldn't expect professional results.... IMHO.

If you can get involved yourself, you would probably save $$$ and
headaches over-all, relative to putting your car in a middling-good
restoration shop.  If the shop quotes you a package price on a tight
schedule, run for the door!  Deals that are too good to be true are
indeed that.

There are a couple of companies who specialize in complete
stripping -- at least one or two offer franchising.  You might check
around to find someone to do the paint removal work this way.  Maybe
subscribe to HEMMINGS or AUTOWEEK and check out the advertisements.

Best of luck!
Glenn

-------------------REF-----------------
I have a 1964 Notchback &quot;Otto&quot; w/ 18,000 original miles.
2,000 miles put on the car in just the past few months.
The car is &quot;rust free&quot; and &quot;OEM complete&quot;.

My desire is to keep it that way, and drive it as a &quot;nice day&quot; driver.
But, as a function of time, unless properly arrested, the few minute
areas of &quot;time erosion&quot; that any 37 year old car acquires while garage
stored will destroy this car that deserves to be saved and cherished.

Question...............
I would like to send the car to a &quot;complete&quot; tear down and build back
up shop.
The car needs to be disassembled and thoroughly cleaned, all metal
chemically treated, rust inhibitor painted, detailed, and re-assembled
so that I can expect 20 good years from it without fearing that
undetected problem cancers might be eating away at my baby while I
sleep.

Please forward this request on, or reply with suggestions, but I would
like to confine my considerations to only very reputable shops that do
scheduled work in a timely fashion, and give excellent results for the
substantial money that I am prepared to spend.
