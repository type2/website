Subject: Need '82 vanagon parts

&gt;I've just purchased an '82 GL and like to find a source of new/used parts preferrably close to 
me (north of Boston). I tried to call VW Buss Heaven in Kingston Ma., but their phones have been 
disconnected. 

 Here's my list so far. 

OUTSIDE
external door handle (sliding door)
grille (single round headlights)
front and rear rubber bumpers that clip into face of chrome bumpers
front right parking light lens (passenger side)
rear parking light lenses (both)
antenna (the local dealer wants $35.00 fot this...RIGHT!)
rear side parking light(s) (need drivers side)
nice wheel rims or wheel covers 

INSIDE (brown interior)
armrests for 1 or 2 front seats 
rubber seal for engine cover
door vent, drivers side
visor clip (inner passenger side)
hand pull (on back of middle seat)
sliding door catch (on back side of passenger door pillar)
sliding door lock latch 
window cranks (2, brown or black)

As you can see I need a lot of small parts. I'm most interested in the door 
handle and front grille assy.  


I also have an '84 with a automatic transmission that doeesn't like to go into reverse wheen 
it's cold.  I'm thinking about converting it to a standard once I get a fuel injection problem 
fixed. I'd like to find a standard tranny and enough parts to allow me to convert. Is there a 
five speed that will fit this beast? I know I'll need the clutch pedal assy, clutch master cyl. 
shift assy w/ linkage etc... I believe I may also need to replace the halfshafts if they're 
different lengths. 

Am I crazy to consider this?
