&gt;I admit that I'm running a celcius guage &amp; that it goes into the red over

Baloney.  220 is perfectly acceptable, in fact when I see 220 I'm thankful 
that I'm running that cool.  :-)


&gt;What sort of ambient temps are you driving in......80-90F or more?
&gt;
&gt;I'm interested, because my engine seems to be on the edge of the red on 
&gt;long trips, even in temperate weather at speeds between 60 &amp; 70mph, at 
&gt;around 3600rpm.
&gt;
&gt;I never have had problems with oil pressure though, with the exception of 
&gt;cold starts, when the light winks a little until the engine's been running 
&gt;about a minute with generous pumps on the accelerator pedal.
&gt;
&gt;I have noticed that the gearbox crunches in 1st when she's very cold though.
&gt;
&gt;Any hints there?


You can try synthetic fluid, if it's avaliable in GL-4.
