Subject: [T2] engine stand, bellhousing needed

Ordered an engine stand from harbor freight now I just looking for a 
bellhousing from a 091 or 002 transmission.  Does anyone have an old dead 
transmission that they would like to part out?  I went to the local foreign 
auto shop that works on old vw's and the guy wouldn't just sell the 
bellhousing.  He wanted $75 for the whole tranny which was buried in mud.  
Thanks, Marcus
