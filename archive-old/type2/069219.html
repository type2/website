They don't come in any rebuild kit I've ever seen.

I picked up a choke element for about $5 at my used-to-be-local VW parts
guy. This was for a 34PICT3. I think I've got 2 or 3 of them by now.

Do you know it's bad? I assumed it's bad and found out it was fine after
playing around a little. Pull it off your carb (you don't have to, but it's
neat to watch it work), run power to the 12v post with one alligator clip,
use another aligator clip to ground it. Hold it in your hand for 1-2 minutes
as it heats up. The coil will contract; the lever will move; your kids will
think you're Bill Nye, the Science Guy ;)

Okay, this is a cheap thrill and a no-brainer to some of you....but on the
day I figured this out, as I recall, I didn't have a brain. What I realized
was that my choke element was out of position.

As for fixing them, they appear excessively simple, but are likely the type
of thing that couldn't be fixed unless you find a solder connection has come
apart and even then, I wouldn't pursue a fix since unless I could figure out
the source of the problem and was sure it wouldn't resurface. They should be
easy enough to obtain from a junkyard. If all else fails, I'd sell you one
of mine at my cost, but I couldn't get it out of Memphis until Friday for
Monday delivery.

Y'know what? I just looked in the BS (Bus Stop) catalog and they're listed
as follows: '71-$18.95; 72-74 rt.-$80.95, lft.-77.75. Mine are all for '71.

Have fun! 8) Joe
