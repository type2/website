&gt; If I have to pay $60 for it and wait for it to be shipped, I will but I'd
&gt; rather find it locally for a bit less money.  Anyone know what kind of pump
&gt; this is, or what type of vehicle originally used it?

I've installed one of these on a non-VW. Very quiet and affordable.

The only problem we had (run on) was completely our fault. We wired it up to
a separate switch for power and when you turned off the engine before
turning the pump off the engine would run-on. We went in circles examining
what was wrong with the carb before going doh!
