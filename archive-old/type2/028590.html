Rick,

I read a day or two ago about how a worn starter bushing will mess up your starting ability. First it starts just dragging; then it gets worse and worse. Of course, the bushing is tough to remove without the engine out, but I actually read about this in a VW Trends article describing how to use a starter bushing removal tool. You can get the tool, the article says, at:

Bugpack (714) 979-4990
or
SoCal Imports (562) 633-9731

The article was in the November, 1998 VW Trends, page 60.

As I re-read your note, though, you said it was all of a sudden. Got a prescription for that too. My old '71 used to have a bum ignition switch. It was worn just right to mess with me from time to time. As it got worse, it started killing the battery too. The PO had a heavy-duty toggle switch in there to run extra juice to the starter. It powered on the coil too, so I had to be sure it was off whenever I turned the bus off.

If you use a little electrical tester thing, you can check to see if you got power coming off the appropriate lead from the ignition switch. You may need a color wiring diagram to figure it out. From looking at mine, I think the wire you're interested in is red and black striped, connecting to terminal 50 on the ignition switch and the starter.

BTW, what part of rural Arkansas are you in? I have family up near Bull Shoals lake, so I drive from Memphis to Bull Shoals every now and then.

Take care! Joe
