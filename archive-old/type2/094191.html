&gt; Where are you getting your tires.  I can get CR21's
&gt; Contis from Tirecraft for about $125 CDN each

&gt; possible.

I miss Canada but I don't miss it that much.  Ah the good old days, paying
duty on an item I bought, then shipping it back to get fixed, then getting
dinged a second time on duty and having to sort it all out.
 
&gt; I was at Costco tonight and it was a disaster.  The guy
&gt; proceeded to show me (in his dog eared book) that the
&gt; correct tire is a 185R14C.  &quot;And you cant get em,
&gt; there's nothing like em anywhere&quot; says he. In the end I
&gt; went through all the tires and read the labels, and
&gt; they go nothing in 185/14 that would work.

Hopefully you can a place that stocks the brand but not the right tire and
they can special order it for you.  My PO used to get tires and batteries
from Sears Automotive presumably because the cost of the VW dealer.  $400
pop top seals etc.
