We got back home late last night from Europe.
Switzerland, Austria, Germany, Croatia, Slovenia, Italy ......... mostly 
small towns and slower back roads when we could. Of course you gotta do the 
big city thing in order to see some stuff. Just the way it is.
Travel was by car and train once over there.

In hand, and it is setting right beside me as I type, via Brian in Holland, 
is a nice powder coated complete set of rear tin for my cousin to properly 
install his 1600DP into his 1973 bus. Brian found and included all new 
fasteners and lots of other stuff for the installation. When my cousin sees 
it, he is gonna wet himself. :-)
It is beautiful !!!!!!!!!!!

Customs man asked what the stuff was.
I explained.
He said, &quot;Oh yeah&quot;. &quot;We see that sort of thing quite often.&quot; ........... huh !?

Saw lots of neat busses, and even got to snoop inside of a Marco Polo.
The Marco Polo was in Switzerland in a small village being driven by some 
Swiss guy.

Marcel, my bus friend from Switzerland did his usual good job of acting as 
tour guide for us, and providing us with everything from visits to vehicle 
junk yards, tool shops, and great eateries. We spent a great night in his 
old wood heated sauna one cold rainy night just talking bus karma and bus 
kinship philosophy sort of stuff.

We even got to go shop in a Swiss military surplus outlet thanks to his 
&quot;used to be in the Swiss army&quot; I.D.
I bought some great VW camping stuff for Pennies on the Franc.
That was an awesome shopping sort of thing for a camping junky like myself.

Mary Beth and I are will now start to get ready to start off on May 1 for 
2001, A Bus Odyssey.
Yippee !!!

Slight hitch in the departure schedule........ We have a chance to go to 
Singapore for a short trip, and may find it hard to turn down.

I have some totally kewel pictures that I will get posted up as soon as I 
can get to the drill of doing same.

I think a smart thing I did was to make special note of putting together my 
methodology for VW bus touring Europe over the next few years after we 
finish off North America.
I have decided it can be done, and it can be done pretty easily.

It just makes us all the more excited about doing same.

Now that we are home, we have decided to sleep in the bus tonight.
We need the mainline fix of the good vibes.

Yeah, we're weird !!
