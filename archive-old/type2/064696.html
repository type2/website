Hi all,    I'm having a charging system quandry.  Last week a bearing
went out on the generator, and after getting a new generator and regulator,
polarizing both of them, the regulator is clicking way too much and
the green wire on it is getting hot.  Also, generator seems too hot.  What
the devil is the problem?  I can't afford another generator right now,
and I grow tired of dealing with it after three R&amp;Rs 8(   Could it be
a short?, a dead battery cell?  I'm too hardheaded to let anyone else
work on it, but I will gladly accept any and all suggestions.  Anyone out
there ever been in this jam?

       Thanx,  Chris  '71 Westy and assorted Beetles
