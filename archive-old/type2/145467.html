Subject: Re: [T2] Need Help  - Do you have   a favorite Bus Recipe or
  meal?

i wondered about that......
  i use to drive mack trucks years ago and well sometimes getting loaded was the best time for me to eat before i hit the road again loaded....or unloaded either one....
   
  usually i didnt have a way to heat anything.being just another stop not exactly always close enough to a choke and puke or even a convience store lots of times..... sooooo i always carried aluminum foil with me.....
  people would laugh at me sometimes those that didnt have a clue and a full belly....when they would see me pulling bulges of aluminum foil off of the mack truck engine block....with fresh hot food steaming out of the foil.....
  thinking i was wierd i guess?? i didnt care that was good food....
   
  i have cooked fish and potatoes and all sorts of stuff on there....yummy ......just gotta watch the times and make sure that its a clean enough spot .....which usually was ... my truck was serviced regularly enough and taken care of....
   
  gosh that seems so long ago now.....
  still a young man here LOL no worries there...
   
  thanks for the memory.....
  course i guess the bus can generate enough heat also.....but those mack trucks man.. that engine would get hotttttttttttttt~!~
   i guess to eat VW Bus food you would have to lay the food up on the inside on the block and maybe few minutes or so before ending your trip....
   
  the mack i usually left running...._dot_depended though on loading/unload time/?????
   
  peace and vw grease

  Skip the frying pan...Wrap in aluminum foil and wire to the
heat exchanger...Cooks in ten minutes or ten miles, whichever
comes first... ;-)
