&gt;An idea I have been playing with is the engine compartment fire
&gt;extinguishers they sell in the marine catalogs. Looks like a regular fire
&gt;extinguisher with a sprinkler (as in fire control) head on it. They used to
&gt;be Halon and now they have some other gas in it. The sprinkler head has a
&gt;fusible link keeping it shut, I can't remember the melting point. Here's a
&gt;link of some with auto or both auto and manual discharge. I think they
&gt;started around $150 and up in the catalog I saw.

Note that for that money you could replace the fuel hoses on a stock system
every year for 10 years running. Properly maintained VW's do not catch
fire, period.

Hoses should be replaced when by inspection they show hardening, fraying of
the woven cover or cracking. My experience has been that this can be
anywhere from 5 to 10 years life. That is with genuine German braided hose.
The smooth high pressure hose is similar. Note that the early FI systems
continued to use the braided hose with 36lbs pressure. Like so many German
materials, the safety margin is HUGE. All that is required is reasonable
maintenance inspections.
