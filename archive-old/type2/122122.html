Subject: Broke Down on side of road!

Really late last night I broke down on the side of the road.
All of a sudden I would accelerate and nothing would happen.
So i pulled off the side of the road. I think the engine died but I can't 
remember for sure, I may have shut it off.
It did this once before like once or twice a day for about a week and 
everyone said it was probably a sediment in the fuel lines.  I would step on 
the pedal and get nothing. eventually I think the engine would run out of 
gas and die.  I could always get going again after knocking around the fuel 
filter and checking the timing.
My bus had been sitting for about a month and the gas tank had been pretty 
low.
Plus we had some snow and ice during that time.
So I was thinking that could be it.
Tried to check the timing, but couldn't get it to idle.
Got it to turn over a couple times, but only while pumping the gas. and it 
would always die out after like 4 seconds.
Now the battery doesn't have enough juice to start it.
So today I pulled off the fuel filter and cleaned t out as best as possible. 
(I didn't get to try to start it yet because I was being burned so badly 
from the gas that ran down my sleeve that I had to rush home to shower). So, 
now I plan to charge the battery and then go back and try and start it.
Is there anything else I should consider besides timing and fuel filter?
Thanks,
Kyle
