I sent this the other day to hopefully answer a dist. question.
On this subject, you can never really believe the number on the side of a
distributor unless you know for sure that it was the original one that was
installed at the factory. If you go buy a cheapo rebuilt, the number on the
housing may or may not mean anything! The only number that may mean anything
at all is the rebuilders part # on the box, but that went by-by when you
turned in the core in that box.
The reason I mention this: I was at one of the local self serve yards today
and they were just putting in a fairly complete 71 bug. It had a 'brand new'
rebuilt distributor in it. Single vacuum advance, full centrifigul... not
what a 71 bug should have. Should have been a dual vacuum unit. So I grabbed
it thinking this will work in my 66 bus.  I am not sure what the vacuum
advance values are on this thing! I really am not sure what the centrifigul
values are either. The number on the housing is 021 905 205E which means it
originally came off a 72 1700 bus with a dual vacuum unit. Without an old
Sun distributor machine who knows what this thing is set up for..... [I wish
I still had one, sold it]. Oh well, nothing like the 'seat of the pants'
test.
Bottom line: beware of the crap out there.



&gt; On the distributor, go here: http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/ignition.htm
&gt; And scroll down. You will see beetle 72-73. Click on that. Look at the
dist
&gt; #....113 905 205AN....now scroll down to 74.....oops quite a few different
&gt; choices then a 73.....now scroll down to 71 bus.....oops, it uses a 211
&gt; number, but below that it says 'can also use 043 905 205D...that is a 74
bug
&gt; Calif Auto stick dist. Good luck finding one!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I was recently given a '71 Campmobile that was stuffed
&gt; &gt; full of parts, including 3 engines. Unfortunately,
&gt; &gt; none of them were installed or running.
&gt; &gt; The one I decided to use had originally come from a
&gt; &gt; Beetle, I think - prefix number begins w/AH. That's
&gt; &gt; 73-74 according to the Wilson book, right?
&gt; &gt; Here's where it gets confusing:
&gt; &gt; The case has been drilled and correctly tapped for the
&gt; &gt; rear bus crossmember - fits, I checked. Bolts right up
&gt; &gt; to the bus. However, I'm at a loss as to shrouding. I
&gt; &gt; know some of it is the same, but I appear to be
&gt; &gt; missing a couple of pieces, including the one that
&gt; &gt; attaches to the front of the doghouse and seals to the
&gt; &gt; firewall. Also, I think I'm missing the airflaps that
&gt; &gt; the list seems to agree should ALWAYS be present.
&gt; &gt; So, what are the differences here? Can I use Beetle
&gt; &gt; sheet metal, or are there special bus pieces/pieces
&gt; &gt; for this year of bus?
&gt; &gt; Related Q: what type of Bosch dizzy does this year
&gt; &gt; engine use (assuming that I'm right and it is a
&gt; &gt; 73-74)?
