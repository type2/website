&gt; One of the admins (Steve D.) had a 2.2L in his Vanagon. I say had
&gt; 'cause he had all kinds of trouble getting the thing to run right
&gt; with the stock FI system. The 2.2L (bored and stroked?? 2.0L) was
&gt; running to lean (to hot) I think. (Steve - correct me or add anything
&gt; please). 

&gt; Ultimately the problems lies with supplying a big cubed motor with
&gt; the flow of gas that it requires reliably.

&quot;Had&quot; is correct :-)  I am back to stock and happy to be there!  There are
a couple problems with running a large engine on the street.  Fuel mix is
one but even with proper fuel mix I believe that the cooling capacity of
the stock system is pressed to the limit by the stock engine. This
includes the oil cooler, which cools the bottom end, and the fan and
shroud, which cool the P&amp;C's and the heads.

I am just not engineer enough to run all the mods that I believe need to
be run to make this sort of thing work out.  I think it could, and it
would certainly be nice to ahve 100+ HP in a bus, but I would want ot have
a B.S. in M.E. and a couple years of experience in automotive design
before I tried it again.
