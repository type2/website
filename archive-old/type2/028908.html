Subject: engine help!

Hello every one, i am new to the list as of this week. i am in the process
of purchasing a 1978 brown and white bus. I am sure i will need lots of
technical advice once i get into this project. So any knowledge you guys
could pass on would be excellent. thakns, Justin Everson. can any one tell
me a list of engines that would fit into a 1978 bus with out anytrouble?
would a 1600 out of a bug fit? also, the bus came with a fuel injected 2.0
in 1978 right? would it be a no hassle swap to drop in a carbeurated 1600?
any help would be greatly appreciated. thanks again.


Justin
78 bus
