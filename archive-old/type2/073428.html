&gt;Anyone got a line on a hitch such as Rick describes?  Can anyone fab

I've got one, but it requires cutting a notch in the bottom of the bumper
for the receiver to protrude through.  For this reason, I haven't used it.
It has a rectangular crossbar behind the bumper that is welded to some
reinforced stock bumper mounts, I believe.  Looks like it was a custom job
but shouldn't be too hard to recreate.
