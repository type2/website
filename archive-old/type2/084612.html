&gt;I have an opinion on the balance issue.  What exactly was balanced?  Just 
&gt;the short block?  Was the flywheel included?  What about pressure plate?  Fan?

&gt;My guess is that the balance probably included the short block and 
&gt;flywheel, and probably didn't include the rest.  Your problem could likely 
&gt;be with &quot;the rest&quot;.  If you have lots of time and really want to figure 
&gt;this out, it's possible to narrow it down some.  All rotating parts are 
&gt;suspect.  Start by removing the fan.  Start the engine (briefly!!) and 
&gt;check for the vibration.  If no change, you have just ruled out the fan 
&gt;and alternator.  Next step would be to drop the engine, remove the clutch 
&gt;and pressure plate, reassemble and check for vibration again.  Two engine 
&gt;pulls required, but you will be able to rule out the clutch.  If none of 
&gt;that succeeds, you can either take the engine back to the rebuilder and 
&gt;ask that it be properly balanced, or just live with it.

Sorry, I just remembered that this is a type 1 engine.  Please change &quot;fan&quot; 
to &quot;fan belt&quot;.  But the engine pull just got easier.  :-)
