Subject: Re: [T2] Trendy VW Bus marketing craze...

&gt; Anything odd or unusual is fair game in advertising
&gt; photos...An avid car spotter can pick out plenty of
&gt; oddball/orphan cars in ads where the object is to
&gt; catch your eye...An Alfa Romeo spider in an insur-

Here in The Netherlands Splitties and Baywindows have
also become terribly trendy over the years. You see
them quite frequently in commercials and magazine ads.
Promotion campaigns also used old buses to travell
through the country to advertise their product (mobile
phones, breakfast cereals, Bacardi, ...). There is a
'bus-dealer' here in the Netherlands who rents them to
these people (http://www.europeancollectables.nl/)
I have also seen Bays and splitties used by several TV
shows that used them to film on locations.

&gt; The NY Lottery runs an ad with a &quot;Woodstock&quot;
&gt; theme and there's a Bay in the back of one of the 
&gt; shots...Despite the fact that Bay's missed the
&gt; original Woodstock by a year... 

I have the Woodstock DVD and the intro shows the line
up of cars that wanted to enter the terrain. There are
lots of old Aircooled buses there, INCLUDING a few
early Bays!!! 
Those must have been rich hippies which such a new
van! ;-)

By the way: Wasn't Woodstock held in 1969?


greetings from Amsterdam,


Vincent
