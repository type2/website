Subject: Front Speaker and cubby hole shelf mockup

I am working on a front speaker box for my 1977 Westy, I worked in CAD a bit
until I needed some fit answers and then went to cardboard.

I haven't worked the mounting out yet, thats another function of the mockup.

I am a speaker designer proffesionally, I think I will actually end up fitting
a 5-1/4 mid and a little neo tweeter behind a  flush grill, still working out
that detail.

The speaker portion will be 100% sealed.

It will have at least 2 cubby holes, similar in design to the ones by the back
door, cut in the front of it.

I am interested in hearing some feedback on the design.
