Subject: Re: Help with push rod tubes

Whoa there. A previous post indicated that one had to take the heads 
off to replace the pushrod tubes.  Nope.  The Push Rod tubes have a 
larger diameter on the head than on the case to allow the case o-ring 
to come out/in without damage.  Heads off for older engines.
Other activities that are needed include, removing the rocker arm 
assemblies, and push rods.  Make sure everything goes back in the 
place where it came out.  Just use the proper o-rings for the proper 
location.  If I remember correctly, the o-rings are of different 
types for the different locations in addition to the diffrenet 
diameters.  Clean everything well.  Happy hunting (oil leaks that is)

PS - pay close attention to the spring location holding the pushrod 
tubes in place.  A interesting challenge in manipulation for 
installation.  Since the pushrod tube is not squeezed between the 
head and case, a spring is used to apply pressure to keep the push 
rod tubes from sliding into the head.  Spring being referred to is a 
long bent wire thingy, not a typical spring shape object.  Practice a 
few times before dismantling the rocker arm assemblies, the spring 
goes in after the rocker arms.

&gt;       I am going to undertake the task of stopping the oil 
&gt; stains that our 80 westy just loves to leave behind. Could 
&gt; any body tell me, Do the push rod tube slide out through 
&gt; the head? Do I need to remove the head to get to them? What 
&gt; sealant should I use?
