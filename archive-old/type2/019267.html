Knocking is not good, and you can't always hear the pre-detonation, just the worst
of it.

Two suggetions Will. First, check to see if it is advancing too far. Connect your
timing light and tach/dwell, and see what the advance is at 3300 RPMs when the
engine is warm. It should be 28-30 degrees advance max. I use this as my timing
and adjust the idle for wherever it lands (in my case at 2 degrees BTDC with a
dual vac with the retard hose plugged as per advice recieved here).

Check the EGR circut. The EGR shuts off at 3/4 throttle and above (I believe) and
the richer fuel mixture contributes to the knocking, but if it is knocking at
below 3/4 throttle your EGR may be plugged or inoperative.

Hey, we'll be in your neighborhood on Tues on our way to Yosemite :)

&gt; I live in the San Francisco Bay area. On a warm day (as today was) at highway
&gt; speed (55 - 75 mph), full or nearly full throttle and any load results in
&gt; knocking (pre-detonation). My initial solution was to check the timing (which
&gt; I had originally set at 7 degrees BTDC).

&gt; The problem only seems to occur at highway speeds (and rpm's). Perhaps the
&gt; distributor is over-advancing....
&gt;
&gt; Any suggestions?
