Subject: BN-4 Heat output (CFM)
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.3.96.981113191119.11726A-100000_at_terra.vol_dot_com&gt;

Hello again list,
	I'm still trying to figure out how setup my duct work to run two
BN-4 heaters (no, not in series!). I want to be burned out of this bus
alive! Anyway, I was wondering if anybody could help me figure out how
many CFM of air the BN-4 puts out. I'm looking for this info in order that
I may correctly build my duct system (starting from scratch). I would like
to configure it where I have one BN-4 that heats the passenger
compartment, and another just for me up front. Any info you could pass my
way, or even crazy suggestions are appreciated. I plan on mounting the
heaters under my rear seat, and running a recirculating system. The other
alternatives are one in the engine compartment, and one under the back
seat, or both of them under the bus and shielded somehow. I know some will
think I am crazy for wanting two of these things on one bus, but I will be
keeping this thing forever, and do not plan on ever freezing again. (ha
ha, destiny laughs again!)

Thanks in advance,
John Tracy

Ps. This is going on a '78 Bus, standard 7 passenger.
