&gt; It's come time for some gauges for the bus. I am planning on oil temp, oil
&gt; pressure, and cylinder head temp. I have been able to find everything
&gt; including, the NLA from VDO, oil pressure sender hose adapter so I dont have
&gt; to cut the tin.

Do check the prices at CIP1_dot_com. I found them to be the best for VDO gauges
even before their 5% of web order and they have the &quot;nla&quot; 10x1 hose
(sometimes out of stock but currently in stock).

&gt; What I cant seem to find is the sump plate for the oil temp
&gt; sender. I dont want to have to drill and tap my current sump plate but would
&gt; rather find the one that I think came off of the 914's. Does anyone have a
&gt; source for these. I checked Pelican Parts but they didn't have them. Is this
&gt; something that I will have to find in the salvage yard?

Junkyard. It was part number 039 101 267 but it's NLA.

&gt; Is this the same thing
&gt; found here at BusBoys http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/bbvdo.htm#tempoil , third one
&gt; down for $21.94?

Not sure. Give Walter a call and find out.

* The 914 plate is special in that it also has a cover that keeps the air
flow under the bus from cooling the sender and throwing off the reading:

* The 914 sender also goes in at an angle:

Your case also need to have this cutout in order to get an accurate reading:
