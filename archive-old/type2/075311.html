Subject: Re: [T2] Re:  T2 VW Font


Man... Everyone needs to mellow out today...  Your taking life too
seriously.  If you want the font bad enough $15 might be worth it to you.
If not don't...  I never said it was free.

I was just passing on info to those that might want it..

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy


&gt; $15 to join their lame club, plus which they don't seem to have any
&gt; categories to fit air cooled VW's, not to mention our buses. Methinks they
&gt; can stuff their club.  Tom
