Bryan:

&gt;start it up and it runs fine for
&gt;a couple of minutes, and then it'll
&gt;die.  Sometimes it's when I give it
&gt;gas, it sounds like the engine bogs
&gt;down, and then I can't start it again
&gt;for a while

It sounds like one possibility is that the fuel pump is operating when
starting, but the switch in the air flow meter that keeps the pump
running once the engine starts is not doing so.

Check out Sean Bartnik's excellent treatise on the AFC fuel injection in
his technical articles at: http://www.type2_dot_com/bartnik/myvan.htm
