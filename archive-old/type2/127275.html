Subject: Re: [T2] re:    Pertronix questions

&gt; I have a question for the list. several people have been running them
&gt; with little problem, and some have have horrible experiences with the
&gt; durn things. Who has bought one in the past, say 2 years or so and
&gt; have one fail? I have 3 in various stages of use and no failures.

I ran one for years until the magnet assy fell apart.
