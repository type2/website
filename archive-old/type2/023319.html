Subject: Re: [T2] misadventures of a vw mechanic wannabe


&gt;I've found golf tees to work great for plugging the fuel line!  I've used
&gt;them on my '70 but haven't tried them on my '78 which I think has 7mm ID
&gt;instead of 5mm ID fuel lines.  It should still work though since the golf
&gt;tee flares.

#2 Pencils work well too. I have also used thick shaft Phillips 
Screwdrivers too. Just tightened the clamps back down on the screwdriver 
once inserted into the hose.

I like the petcock idea best.
