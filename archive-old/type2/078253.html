Subject: Re: [T2] re-enforced sidewall tires, recomenations please!

You want the BF Goodrich All-terrain TA tire in 27x8.5x14.  They will 
fit fine on all four wheels of your '76 and they are probably the best 
offroad tire you can get for the bus that are still liveable on the 
street.  The price you pay for that is a) high initial cost, b) more 
noise than highway tread tires, and c) ride is not as cushy as the 
highway tread tires.  The handling will be &quot;crisp&quot; - in fact they are 
the best handling tire I've had on my bus.
