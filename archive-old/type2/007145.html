Hello everyone!

     I just got a set of Vanagon alloy wheels(Thanks, Steve), so now I
need some longer wheel studs, off of a vanagon, So Does anyone have any
laying around they want to part with? Hay Ron(bus depot) do you have any
new? Nikki have you came across any in your finds? 

     Also will a rear hub off of a vanagon fit on my 79 bus? I'll need
all 20 studs. The salvage yards around here don't have any vanagon's. 

     Could someone maybe cross post this to the vanagon list?

Thanks,
Shawn Reed
