The delivery date probably reflects the date it was delivered to the
port/ship for delivery to SF. I'll bet it's just a reflection of the
administrative red-tape bad information syndrome of the mid-50's. 

You know, there's this form. You're a worker and you're supposed to write
something on this form. You don't really know what it is, so you write down
what you think it is. Someone in the computer room types it into punched
cards and feeds it into the mainframe. They type whatever you wrote. It's
all pretty insignificant data that nobody cares about, so no one checks to
see if you're entering what they asked for. You don't hear different, so you
keep doing the same thing for the next 3 years...until you get a better job,
plucking feathers off of chickens.

...Then, 40 years later, while you're wiling away your retirement years
fishing, a bunch of obsessed fanatics start ripping your data to shreds,
scrutinizing its accuracy. But you still don't care, cause you're after the
big one. By now you've figured out that all that stuff you did way back then
really doesn't matter to anyone anyway. ;)
