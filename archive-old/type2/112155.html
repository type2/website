Subject: Re: [T2] Silverfish

&gt; Guys, is it just me or.... I think the door handle
&gt; molding down the side looks waaaay ugly.
&gt; I wonder why they thought that it looked good...or
&gt; again, is it just me?

No, it was the 70ties-spirit, just like the Champagne
Edition bus that you're riding in :-)

The chrome striping with rubber molding was standard
on deluxe buses from 1974 onwards. May be not
available in the USA. But don't be sad, it's the ideal
breeding habitat for our worst enemy: rust. So you
didn't miss it.

This chrome striping was introduced with modelyear
1974 (aug 1973). From that time on the old striping
(the one just below the windows) was still available
but only for Westies as M-code 728.
