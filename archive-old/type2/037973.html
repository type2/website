&gt; ...(How to cut a hole in dash for an oil temp gauge)...

Measure the gauge and get a hole drill the right size. My toolbox is not 
at work with mew so I can't check the size of one I have, but it's a 
standard size that is easy to find. One inch and some fraction.

The dash is made of lightweight foam covered with a tough vinyl veneer 
and backed by thin sheet metal. I recommend cutting through the vinyl 
layer with a knife before drilling to avoid ripping it. The drill goes 
through the foam like soft cheese and then labors a bit on the sheet 
metal. Oil the teeth and use light presure and an easy touch to cut 
through nice and slowly with no big catch-bend-warp problems and no 
punch-through-suddenly-and-cut-into-other-wiring-behind-the-dash problems.

I've got 3 gauges now mounted in my dash below the stock hole for the 
radio. There's plenty of room if you are thoughtful and careful.

Your actual mileage may vary.

Good luck,
