Hey everyone.

Just a quick note that the engine is officially remounted in the bus. =
Thanks to all of you for your advice and help.

I think I may of found a dipstick. I have an idea for the heater pipe. =
However I am still looking for the driver side tube that sits on top of =
the heat exchanger. (between the flexible hose and the heat exchanger.

Now for the brakes and the master cylinder. I think I'm investing in a =
face shield before I go any further. :-)
