&gt; My best friend bought this bus at an auction about a year ago, it has

&gt; corduroy seats, it has the clock in it and the door panels are differnet
&gt; than normal too. Is this the Champagne Edition? What are these worth? Do
&gt; they have any rarity to them? I think it's a '78. I can get this bus for
&gt; free and am debating is it worth it....See a picture at:

Yes it is a Champagne edition.
I feel that there is some premium value to the package, but it's hard to
say how much that is. The tape stripes fade and I doubt there are many
to be found for sale.
Whether it's worth fixing up depends mostly on the condition and your
expected use.
