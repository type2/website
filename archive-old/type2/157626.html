 You are referring to the path the heat from the tip
 travels. The thermocouples that go under the plugs
 pick up heat from the head itself plus the heat from
 the barrel of the sparkplug and it has nothing to do
 with the heat path from the tip unless you consider
 that it adds another step along the way which is not
 true if you don't use the crush washer. -BaH
 
Remember also, that spark plugs are made to
 disperse
 heat *into* the 
 heads.  Remember the counter-intutive thoughts on
 what a &quot;colder&quot; or 
 &quot;hotter&quot; plug choice does and think of it this
 way.
 
 A colder plug dumps more heat from the sparking
 end
 &gt; into the head to keep 
 the tip cooler, while a &quot;hot&quot; plug wants to keep
 more of the heat at the 
 end of the plug in order to maintain the
?800-1400?
 degree C that is 
 required to make them burn correctly and last
 longer.
 
 My premise is that what you are actually reading
the
 heat being dumped
 by the spark plug into the head rather than the
 actual head temperature.
 
 Y'all think about it for a moment and tell me how
I
 amthinking about this 
 wrongly....besides the fact that &quot;that's where
 everyone puts them&quot;.
