Subject: Re: [vanagon] Factory sticker estimaged mileage?

Well,

Looking at the window sticker for the 1981 ASI Weekender I have for 
sale, it says:

1981 VANAGON
120 CDI ENGINE
4 CYLINDER, FUEL INJECTION
AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION
CATALYST EQUIPPED

ESTIMATED MPG
16

And for the follow up question:

$11,830 + the cost of the ASI conversion and it was originally sold by 
Riveria Motors.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; Anyone know of a source to find the estimated mpg city/highway that
&gt; was listed on the sticker in the dealership on buses?
&gt;
&gt; Specifically, I'm interested in my '80 Vanagon, 2.0L, fi w/air (no
&gt; removed), non-California.
&gt;
&gt; I'd just like to know how things compare today to when it was new.
