Subject: 76 broke down.........ideas?

Here is what happened.  Van has been running great.

Started losing power and backfiring.............had to &quot;limp&quot; about 5 more
miles to  a friends house to get off the interstate.

All vacuum attached.................oil level about 2&quot; high, so i suspect
leaky or constant injector.  I unplugged cold start valve and same symptoms.
Distributor did not come loose, either.

I have to get back over there and fix it after lunch...............any
ideas?
