&gt; I am having a problem with the fuel gauge on my '77 Westi.  Most of the time

if it is a Fuel Injected type IV engine (stock on your vehicle) and you
have small arms (or friend) you can get the sender in without cutting
anything.  check the archives for details 
but basically you need to

remove the Air flow meter and air filter.  
       the double relay, and ballast
       remove the bulkhead between the engine compartment and gas tank
        (don't forget the two _at_#$&amp;*_at_#&amp; screws that come up from under the
              bus.)

reach into the opening and find the two wires on top of the sender, pull
them off.  turn sender 1/4 turn counter clockwise (very hard, and if it
isn't you need a new O ring)  wiggle, twist, curse etc. it will come out,
I find it best to go towards the drivers side of the vehicle then pull it
around the side of the tank.

 reverse the prochedure to install the new one, give yourself several
hours.

&gt; travelling this year.  Also, there is a fuel smell at times in the cabin,
&gt; especially after filling it and going around turns.  I think the vent
&gt; hose(s) are leaking.  Can this be fixed as well when they cut an access hole
&gt; for the sender?

no these are on the sides, most common place to leak is the area above the
battery in the air intake ducts (or place where battery would be on the
other side) there is a fitting in there that evidently vibrates and breaks
the hose near the fitting.
