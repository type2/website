Subject: '69 dblcab rear glass

Greetings and happy thanksgiving from an ex-turkey
rancher,

Well, I chucked a piece of firewood into my pickup
and it sailed into the back of the cab below the
rear window.  The &quot;SHMACK&quot; was enough to shatter
the rear window.  It being safety glass, is still
holding together but UGLY... and my heart sank.

Now, I don't suppose there is any chance of
getting a new piece of glass with the rear
defogger like
the one I used to have, but I have a question if
anyone in the know can help me on...

Being that this is flat autoglass, can this be cut
by a glass shop, or must I search high and low for

a replacement glass piece?  Those of you with
pickups know that it is different from the
standard
bus rear glass and has a kind of &quot;arched&quot; shape.
Also, I welcome any creative solution, whether it
be a source for a replacement or ?????

Lay off the gravy and pass the spudtaters!

C.  '69 doublecab
