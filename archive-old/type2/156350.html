&gt;  Hey James, NGK B5RES (resistor plug) are equivalent
&gt;  to the Bosch W8CC. I
&gt;  just bought a set from NAPA in Calgary. I assume
&gt;  NAPA is also in
&gt;  toontown?   Those plugs have always worked well for
&gt;  me.

&gt; No.... NGK B5ES would be the equivalent to the W8CC.

And the R comes after the B:  BR5ES

The B is the thread size (14mm), R is resistor, P is projected tip, 5 is
heat range (lower is hotter), E is the thread reach (E=3/4 inch long
reach, H=1/2 inch short reach) and S is a standard electrode.

The plug that comes in mexican engines with long reach heads is a BP5ES.
I think that the correct plug for short reach applications is B5HS.  A
BP5HS would also work well.

Pay attention to the reach!  You don't want to put a put a short plug in a
long head or vise versa!
