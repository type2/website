Subject: full width bed wanted

     Hi,  well finally got the '63 single cab road legal.  Lots of 
     re-wiring and it has brake lights even when the headlights are on!!!  
     Now to fix the circuit for turn signals.  There is about a 2&quot; gap in 
     the engine compartment above the motor.?  I pulled motor last week and 
     redid the startewr bushing, etc.  I also put new seals all around 
     inside the compartment, thinking the absense of the seals was the gap 
     problem (stupid, I didn't look carefully enough).  Well the nice new 
     seals look great but there is still this huge gap above the fan 
     shroud.  Is this because of the 1500 motor in this vehicle?  Did the 
     smaller motor use a larger shroud?  
     
     Also, a friend called an ad this weekend about a motor for sale and 
     after asking questions found out there was a '65 Deluxe that had been 
     parked years ago that used to go with it.  He was GIVEN the bus to get 
     it out of the yard!  He is looking for a full width fold down seat/bed 
     for it.  Buzz me if you know of one for sale. Another one gets back on 
     the road!
     Ray
