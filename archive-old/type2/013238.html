Hello list, and an early Happy Mother's Day to all you Mothers out there:

A warning: This post is a bit long, and details my experiences with Michelins, so if you're not interested, get out now.

On the subject of tires, first of all, let me say that I'm really happy for anyone that gets any satisfaction from Michelins, but in my experience, I've had 4 sets of Michelins, all different models, on 3 different cars in my lifetime, and I wouldn't take a set of Michelins if you paid me.  I had a set on my wife's Dodge Colt, and 2 of them separated in less than 20K miles.  Luckily I saw them before they blew out.  The dealership replaced them with a different model of Michelin, under warranty, and one of them separated in less than 10K miles.  This car was well maintained, the tires all had proper inflation, rotation, alignment, etc.  The next set I had was a replacement set on our 96 Grand Cherokee.  Unfortunately, I don't remember the exact model, but according to the tire store guy, they were supposedly &quot;top-of-the-line&quot; Michelin Light Truck, all-weather tires.  These things had much worse ride quality than even the factory Goodyears.  They hydro-planed really badly, and I just didn't feel safe driving on them.  The last set of Michelins, and the ones that really made me swear to never drive on them again, came on my 97 Sebring convertible.  At first they were OK, but didn't have the kind of grip I like.  I drive fast and hard (former auto-crosser), and I attributed the mediocre handling to the car's limitations.  I looked at the Michelin website, and these tires were their second-best all-weather performance radial.  After about 23K miles, the handling went to hell in a hand basket.  In the rain, I fish-tailed on 2 occasions while braking on a down-hill off-ramp, and on multiple occasions, the front tires would spin when I started from a dead stop.  They also hydro-planed badly, from the day I drove the car off the show room floor.  Not good for all-weather tires.  I had the brakes checked, new shocks installed, alignment, etc., and the problems still existed.  I decided the handling problems had to be the fault of the tires, so I changed them.  It was an immediate night-and-day difference in every aspect, from ride comfort, grip, braking, no more hydro-planing, and the car handled like a sports car.

So what tires did I replace the Michelins with??  As I stated earlier, I used to auto-cross, so I like performance tires, and got to try many different brands in my racing days.  On the Colt, I replaced them with Yokohamas.  Never had a problem after that.
On the Jeep, I put on Yokohama Geolander H/T's, which, I found out later, are one of the highest rated light truck tires on the market, and in my experience, deservedly so.  They have great ride quality, are quiet, don't hydro-plane, have good grip, and will probably be the ones I put on my bus when I need new tires.  On the Sebring, I put on Dunlop SP8000's.  An extreme, quantum leap improvement in every aspect over the Michelins.  

Anyway, there's my long-winded story on my Michelin experiences.  I know some of you have had nothing but good results with Michelins, and like I said, I'm happy for you.  Do what you wish with this info.

&gt;I have been running Michelins exclusively on all my cars including 20+
&gt;VW's over 30 years and the only time I had a tread peel was when I had
&gt;passenger car tires on a bus, and they lasted 45,000 miles or so...didn't
