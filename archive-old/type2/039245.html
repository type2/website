Subject: Auburn Hills show?

Steve and listees-

This is the second reference to the 'Auburn Hills show' on the weekend
of the 20th.  I live in Michigan about 2 hours from Detroit (ok, three
in the bus) and would love to go but I can't find any more info about
this one.  Who is holding it, is it all VWs and is there a website with
more info about where, when and if camping is allowed?

Anyone?
