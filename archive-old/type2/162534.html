AH HAH,    this is an MSD coil and they say to put one of their resistors
in series with the coil + so it is 12+ going into the resistor, 10 coming
out and going to the coil.   and it acted the same way before I got this
coil with no resistor.   wonderiing what I might possibly daamage if I
bypassed the coil, maybe that is why the points didn't work????  but why
would it now work with the pertronix...

&gt; &gt; drawing a lot of power?....or something wired in with it up front when you
&gt; &gt; turn the key on?  How much voltage from the positive wire at the front

12+

&gt; &gt; Run a wire straight from your battery pos side to the coil...with nothing
&gt; &gt; else hooked to the positive side of the coil and then see what your spark
&gt; &gt; looks like...

no difference


  thanks
 Bob
