Subject: Re: [T2] heater cable stuck in tube

Been there!  I yanked and yanked and yanked on mine
and it finally came out after stretching the cable
quite a bit. I fed the new one through and it got
all the way to the back of the tube but wouldnt come
out the other end. I thought I had broken part of the
cable off in the tube and was screwed. After much
kicking/screaming/cussing (suprised my neighbors didnt
call the police), I realized the white plug was still
in the rear end of the tube. It was covered in dirt, so
it appeared to be the tube itself. Got my needle nose
pliers on it and removed it and all was well. There
shouldnt be anything in the tube that would cause that
kind of binding. Check that plug.
