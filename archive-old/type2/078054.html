Subject: oil pump puller question

does anyone out there have a picture of an oil pump puller.. or know where i 
can find one on the web. i have had a stuck oil pump on my engine for like 
two weeks now heehee.. i am waiting on my pump to get here anyway so it 
hasn't mattered.. from what i have been told about these pullers it sounds 
as if someone could fabricate one without much trouble.. i hate to order one 
and have to wait another week to put my new oil pump in while the puller is 
in shipment.
thanks
