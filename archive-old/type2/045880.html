    You could always hide a key in one of the many rust holes in your bus.  Just
be sure to pick one that doesn't go through to the ground.

    Or you could be like me, and not worry about locking the keys in the car,
because you could just get in through the vent window that's duct taped on
(soon it will be gaff tape, which is ever so much more elegant).  Mine is the
kind of bus that says &quot;You're not getting in here . . . . . unless you . . push
with your arm.&quot;

I do love the sarcasm.
