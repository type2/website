Subject: Re: [T2] ignition wire on coil

Max -

Before you lose what's left of the clutch, just simply unplug the bypass
wire that goes to your coil (Terminal 15).  Engine will shut right off.  Be
sure to insulate the end so it doesn't accidently short out on metal in the
engine compartment.

Now let's do some diagnosis:

Tools needed:

Voltage/Ohm Meter (VOM)

The current flow is this way - Black wire from the ignition switch to the
fuseblock, fuse # 11 (which is &quot;ganged&quot; to # 10 and #12).  It then jumps off
fuse #10 back to the engine compartment.

Also refer to the wiring diagram if you don't have the Green Bentley Book
(Section 4, Diagram E):

http://vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/

Note:  Thom has two different USA 1971 diagrams on his site, so note your
vehicle's production date.

1.  Disconnect the Black wire from Fuse #11.  Set your VOM to Voltage at 12
volts or above, connect the plus (+) to the wire coming from the Ignition
Switch and the - to the fusebox.

2.  Turn the Ignition to ON (do not start the bus!).  Voltage should be 12
volts.  If not, Ignition switch is shot - replace it (VW 111 905 865 F).  If
OK, proceed to the next step.

3.  Keep the same connections.  Turn the Ignition On and then to the Start
position.  Voltage should be around 9 to 11 volts because of the starter
load draw.  If lower or no voltage, Ignition Switch is shot - replace it.
If OK, reconnect the Black wire back to fuse #11 and proceed to next step.

4.  We need to check continuity from the fusebox to the engine
compartment. Go to the engine compartment and disconnect the Black wire from
Terminal 15 on the coil.   Connect it to the plus (+) side of the VOM.
Connect the minus (-) side to the coil.  Turn the Ignition Switch to ON
position only.  It should read 12 Volts.  If not, there may be a break in
the wire in the harness somewhere.  If this is the case, you may be able to
spot where the break is, either in the front or in the engine compartment,
which is a more likely culprit.  Why?  Over 30 years of engine heat can
eventually harden and break at the crimped connection to the push-on
terminal.  Easily fixable if this in this case.

6.  Second way to determine the Black wire to the coil is suspect.
Disconnect the wire at fuse #10.  Disconnect the wire at the coil (terminal
#15).  Reset your VOM to 1K or 2K ohms.  Connect the plus (+) wire to the
Black coil wire in the driver's cab.  Connect the minus (-) to a a real long
wire back to the engine compartment and connect it to the exposed Black coil
wire.  The meter should read 1 or 2K ohms (depending on your VOM setting),
indicating full continuity.  If there is no reading or if the reading is low
and/or flucuating in the low numbers area, there's probably a break in the
wire.

5.  If the break is determined to be within the harness itself (unlikely,
but it's possible,) then a permanent bypass wire to replace this will need
to be made or the main harness has to be replaced (expensive and time
consuming).

In regards to #3 above, if there is no voltage when the switch is in the
start position it's probably because the metal wafers that rotate &amp; slide
over each other for the connection have probably come loose and are
&quot;floating&quot; all over the place, resulting in no connection to the proper
circuit(s).

&gt; Hi List,
&gt; '71 Westy 1600dp
&gt; I am still trying to figure out my problems with my ignition. I turn the
&gt; key and get power to everything, and the starter spins really well. I get a
&gt; really tiny bit of current coming to the wire that connects to the coil. I
&gt; would assume I am supposed to get around 12 volts. Since everything works
&gt; and there are no blown fuses, and the terminals are clean, I am left to
&gt; believe that the wire from the fuse block to the coil is shot. Does this
&gt; sound like a correct diagnosis? I am bypassing the whole system right now
&gt; but it is annoying because to turn off the bus I have to pop the clutch to
&gt; kill the engine. I look forward to the advice,
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Max Bronsema
