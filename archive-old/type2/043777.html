Subject: [T2] 86 Vanagon question

I can't seem to find the site to ask questions to off this board it won't let 
me access. Is there a site I can't get info on how to change a grommet (donut 
circular plastic cup about the size of a silver dollar in circumference) on 
the bottom of the shifter. 
    Any thoughts about purchasing a 86 syncro (never worked on one) 129,000 
rebuild has aproox 20,000)( AZ vehicle here in NY) as opposed to my 71 Westy. 
Just curious.
        TIA
            Andy the MM
