&gt;The Library indicates that when hot, the flaps should
&gt;be &quot;fully open&quot;; similar to if you had no cable
&gt;attatched.  However, this blocks the oil cooler.

It doesn't block the oil cooler.  If you look closely, when the flap is
&quot;covering the oil cooler&quot; it is actually directing a percentage of the air
over the cooler, underneath the flap.  The air comes in through the back,
not the top.  The way you have described it is the correct way the flaps
should operate.
