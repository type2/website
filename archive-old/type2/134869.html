Subject: Re: [T2] Charging Problem

From: &quot;john kolak&quot; &lt;jkolak_at_gmail_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Well, it could possibly be Mike. Usually those attach to the battery
clamp, but you can't make any assumptions. You will need to get under the
bus and see where the other end of it is. It probably goes to the starter
where all the positive wires go. If it does go there, it won't hurt to
attach it to the battery and see if you get charging. Does your alternator
light on the dash stay on all the time?

It does look like it would easily reach the positive terminal on the
battery.  At least it's &quot;memory&quot; position seems to indicate that.  But it
would also as easily pass through the firewall, too.  I'm not sure how to
verify if it's connected to the alternator.  Can't see the end of it with
the tin in the way.  I'll poke around under the bus tomorrow to see if I can
figure out where it's connected.

Yes, the alternator light seems to glow, at least, most of the time.  Harder
to see it in the daytime, but it comes on brighter the moment I cut on the
lights.  Then eventually the lights start to dim, the horn stops working,
and the run signals stop the moment you hit the brakes.

I've been staying close to home mostly, making a lot of day trips.

You know, it sounds pretty stupid to have put up with this for so long (a
couple of months).  I am properly chagrined.

&gt; Look around too for evidence of someplace that might have been
&gt; attached. Wires develop a memory and like to hang near where they were
&gt; detached from. Look for a screw it might have been attached to, with
&gt; attendant wear signs where the connector might have been. Often I have
&gt; found stray wires because a PO had some accessory they wanted a power
&gt; wire for. Removed accessory and left stray wire.

&gt;
&gt;  Actually, this might be a new connector added by a PO.  The wire appears
to
&gt;  have a new end spliced onto it.
&gt;
&gt;  Um... this couldn't possibly be the wire that charges the battery, could
it?
