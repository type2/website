It's a Safare high-roof but I guess it was converted from a standard Bay.

&gt;I would LOVE to learn how I might rig a head temp or oil temp
&gt;sensor into an overhead console that otherwise digitally displays
&gt;outside temp.

Shouldn't be that difficult.  I ran most of the wires up next to the A-pillar in a plastic sheath.  A few had to be run up underneath the overhead A/C unit and down the B-pillar.  Once I get everything finalized, I think I should be able to run most or all of the wires *inside* the A-pillar but it will be a big job and I only want to do it once.

&gt;  And truthfully, the idea of a digital compass is
&gt;pretty exciting, too.

I've held off on that for a couple of reasons.  Cost is a factor though it wouldn't be if I could be convinced that it will work well.  Has anyone tried one?  Finally my granddad gave me a black metal tank compass that would look really cool mounted to the top of the dash - I may just use that.
