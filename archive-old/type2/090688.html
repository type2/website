Subject: We have a winner!!!  Was: timing off at 20 degree BTDC 

Yesterday, Barry posted:

&gt;The bus:
&gt;Stock '78 Fuel Injection USA 49 States model.
&gt;
&gt;The problem:
&gt;Timing is seen at 20 degrees BTDC, and timing white mark
&gt;does NOT advance with increase in engine speed.

Then later, he updated it to say:

&gt; (3) I pinched off the vacuum tube from the air cleaner, pulled off the
&gt; vacuum gauge, and sucked on the hose from the gauge. That is, I
&gt; applied vacuum to the distributor bisket with the engine running. I
&gt; then got the timing to advance from 20 to about 34, so I think the
&gt; problem is before the distributor bisket.

Dr Tim replied:

&gt; Sounds like the mechanical advance weights are stuck at full advance.
&gt; You need to remove the point plate and clean and lube the weights for
&gt; free movement, then reinstall it and reset the points and timing.

Then this morning, Karl replied:

&gt; My guess also.
&gt; Remove the cap and try to twist the rotor. It is supposed to turn
&gt; clockwise and then spring back. It is probably fully clockwise and
&gt; have to force it to go back. Remove the rotor. See the felt pad in the
&gt; center? Part of a tune-up is to put a few drops of oil in the felt,
&gt; but no one ever does.... until the upper shaft freezes!.

Anyhow, I live close to Barry, and I was doing my rounds today anyhow
(went over to Pat Flynn's this morning to finish the install of the engine
in his '75 DC, went to my garage to work on the '73).  So after we got
Pat's engine running (still need the clutch adjusted to run... :-(, I went
over to Barry's place.  I thought the same as Tim and Karl, that his
mechanical advance was somehow stuck at full advance, but sided more with
Tim on the &quot;stuck weights&quot; theory than with Karl's &quot;rusty shaft&quot; theory as
I have experienced stuck weights causing this problem myself.

It turns out that Karl is the winner this time!  The upper and lower
shafts are immovably rusted to each other.

The ported vacuum was fine, and the vacuum biscuit in his dist was also
fine, so he was getting full advance when needed and this problem probably
had no effect on drivability.  He'd have toasted his engine in traffic but
(he said sticking his tongue firmly into his cheek) we don't have much of
that here :-)  Actually, I don't think that Barry commutes in the bus, so
he probably does not spend much time at idle.  It would have gotten ugly
if he did, tho :-(

Anyhow, Barry had a good spare in his parts box, we installed it and I
added his toasty dist to my collection.

THE LESSON.... As Karl said, next time you have your 205P or 205S ('76-79
bus) distributor open, do it a favor, pop the rotor off and drop a bit of
oil on the felt pad under the rotor, eh?

HOWEVER...  broken/loose springs on the weights can and have caused the
dame problem.  Look at both causes.
