Sean, 

Thanks for the answer  BUT mine dont work that way (at least not in their
present state.  So can I adjust them?  I mean, they work so well in the
 opposite harmony that they are in right now, it looks like it is designed
that way.  Ones open, others closed.  and they switch when I pull the wire
down.  If you can explain anymore, please enlighten me.

Tia Ned
