Subject: 71' disk brake rebuild
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-SLUIDL: 62805D5C-68C711D4-89C20010-4B9F219E

Morning,
	I have a 71' camper (custom high-roof) that needs a front caliper rebuild
soon.  The pads are not retracting properly.  I need to take it camping in
a few days and plan on doing it when I get back.  Anyone know what this
entails?  Is it just check and clean the piston, change dust seal and bleed
screw?
	I just bought this bus and have been doing what maintenance I can before I
go.  The previous owner neglected everything for the last 3 years at least.
Any info would be appreciated.
