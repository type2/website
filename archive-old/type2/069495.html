Thanks, and thanks everybody who responded.
Since it's pouring down rain here, and I won't be under the bus 
this evening...  I'll think about it.

My Snap-on Guy will bring me a   1 13/16   tomorrow, for $34.75 (Texas dollars) 

Now, isn't that just about .03mm bigger than 46mm? 

I'll probably acquire a whole set of the giant metric sockets, somewhere, someday,
but maybe I can fix my van sometime this month if I can just get the !_at_#$ wrench.
I called NAPA, their world HQ is an hour drive from my office.  They said they had
what I wanted.  I went there.  They had lied!  I said, if they ever want to see my
money again, get it to me before I decide to call the snap-on truck.  
They said &quot;sure, as long as you pay first&quot;.  I gave them my card, said &quot;[many words]...
You already lied to me... I don't trust you... losing a customer... blah blah blah..&quot;

I do not need NAPA.  I MIGHT need VW someday, so I'd be a bit calmer if they lied
to me, but not much :-)
