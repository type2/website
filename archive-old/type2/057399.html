Subject: Shipping an engine

I'm lookin for some shippin help/advice.

As mention previoulsy I'm selling my 79 2L.  I have gotten
inquires from distant places.  Is there anyone out there who
has shipped an entire engine before and might be able to
suggest easy ways to do so, or tell me what I shouldn't do.

Please respone directly to me.  I'm still not recieving list
mailings for some reason.

Thanks
Brent
