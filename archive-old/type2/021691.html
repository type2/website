Subject: Re: [T2] Now what?!?  69 bus tire/ brake issues

I'm still fairly new to Type 2's, but I know of two simple (but annoying) probs that can
happen when you do wheel work. And with drums, you can see either of them.
Firstly, if you have had the wheels off for a while, or if you haven't driven the van in a
while, and there's moisture inside your drum you will have rust. So now where ever the shoes
were in contact with the drum when this rust occured is still smooth compared to the rust
&quot;exposed&quot; surface. When you brake this can cause a vibration until you have worn past the
rust.
Secondly, if your wheels have been on your bus as long as mine have, they were probably a
real bitch (gangster rappers please pronounce as &quot;be-yotch) to get off. So they probably gave
them a few &quot;taps&quot; with a mallet to get them loose. This technique however can also loosen
debris inside the rotor which can get caught under a shoe, which can cause vibrations, and in
a worst case scenario, severe &quot;track marks&quot; on the inside of your drum. Use the mallet on the
mechanics head and have them look inside the rotor for any signs of the above.  Unless, of
course, you are the mechanic in question.
As per Chris, I had the same thing on my Suzuki rotors, I re-torqued them with my old
&quot;clicker&quot; and they were fine.

The Bus Fire Defense League thanks you for not lighting your bus on fire, it will do it on
it's own.

&gt; They warped your rotors by overtorquing the lug nuts.
&gt;
&gt; At least this would be my first guess.
&gt;
&gt; Loosen the lug nuts and re-torque - even a basic torque wrench or even a
&gt; calibrated mechanic will work.
&gt;
&gt; Hopefully this will fix it. I don't know if this will release any warping
&gt; they might have caused.
&gt;
&gt; I had this happen to a Honda I used to own - each lug nut was on about 45#
&gt; too much.
&gt;
&gt; Now I won't even let a shop tighten the lug nuts on my car (different shop)
&gt; with an air ratchet. I request permission to torque the nuts myself when
&gt; the wheels go back on. They think I'm crazy but instead of a 12 year old
&gt; Honda I am driving a 2 year old Honda with 40K miles versus 140K miles and
&gt; I am a little more picky... &lt;grin&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Every - every - time I check they have missed the shop manual toque spec on
&gt; the tight side. That includes when they use those little colored extensions
&gt; on their air ratchets.
&gt;
&gt; One fellow didn't believe me and asked to let him try with his little air
&gt; gun. He did and still missed by 20#'s or so.
&gt;
&gt; By the way I use a click type torque wrench - worth it's weight in gold to me.
&gt;
&gt; I'm really curious so post any answers you might find.

&gt; &gt;I finally got the new tires on the 69 camper today 185R14 D rated.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;They say  65 pounds maximum pressure, and that is what they put in them, but
&gt; &gt;what pressures should I run?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The tire place had a hell of a time getting them balanced due to an
&gt; &gt;adjustable adapter that was not working right, so I am not sure they are
&gt; &gt;balanced correctly. Anyway, as I drove off there was no roughness in the
&gt; &gt;ride. They seemed very smooth until I touched the brakes. When I touch the
&gt; &gt;brakes, the petal does that vibrating up and down thing like I have a warped
&gt; &gt;drum. What the?
&gt; &gt;Why would this start right after the new tires were put on? It does not make
&gt; &gt;any sense to me.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I'm ready to set the thing on fire, and be done with it. Please help.
