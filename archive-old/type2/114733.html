&lt;&lt; I checked the Camper and Commercial Magazine and found out that the paint 
is
called coach paint or coachworks enamel. I have read that Tekaliod
(spelling?) is the best. According to the mag this stuff can be applied just
as good as a sprayed job if done right.  &gt;&gt;

Here's a good overview of 'coach-painting' and an idea of what you're gonna
face if you decide to 'try it'... 8-(

Can it be done? Yes, I've seen at least one car ('36 Bentley) that the owner
did himself...Six months in the garage, just on the paint job according to
the owner/masochist...
