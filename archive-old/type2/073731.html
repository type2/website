Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof solutions for former poptop campers??

Small wonder everyone's buying Bays.
They're cheaper,have stronger,more powerful running
gear &amp; are heaps more common.
I wish someone would tell HotVW's Magazine though.
I love Samba's &amp; every variety of pre-67 bus,but for
once it would nice to see what someone had done with
the same model as I drive around everyday.
To date I've only seen one bay in HotVW's....a orange
'72 Panel running a 2.0liter with Porsche heads.
A beautiful bus all round.
:-)
Cheers
Andrew Wood.

&gt; &gt;HA! That doesn't mean folks won't try.. Here in
&gt; Austin there is a gorgeous
&gt; &gt;(outside) 70 Deluxe for sale...Asking price? 
&gt; $5,000!!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, and out here in west TX they are selling for
&gt; $4500 
&gt; &quot;restored&quot;....which means fresh paint, interior, and
&gt; engine...not 
&gt; neccessarily stock. That's mostly for campers...but
&gt; sometimes not! 
&gt; Don't know what Splitties sell for here as there
&gt; aren't ever any for 
&gt; sale. Only ones around are in barns or fields. But
&gt; the Bays are VERY 
&gt; poplular and seem to be getting more and more
&gt; popular.
