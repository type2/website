Subject: Fuel line routing?

1800 cc engine. Between the tank and the pump the PO had a small plastic
filter which dangles below the starter. The first length of hose is
about 10'' long, then the filter, then the line loops up to the clip on
the underside of the vehicle and back down to the fuel pump.

Is this a kosher setup? It makes sense that the filter would be *below*
the starter, but I'm a little uncomfortable with it just swinging in the
breeze down there.
