JUNKED '76 DOUBLECAB???!?!?  Life is so unfair!!!

&gt;Will this fit my ´71? Do I have to pull the main

If the '71 is the same as the '73, it will fit.  The servos changed
slightly somewhere around 76, with the later one giving more boost and
being just a little larger.  The later one will fit, but it hits against
the frame.  I used one like this for some time with no problems.

Changing it without removing the master cylinder will be much more
difficult than removing the master cylinder first and bleeding the brakes
afterwards.  I'm not even sure it's possible to do it.  If the servo is
bad, the most likely cause is from the master cylinder leaking brake fluid
into it, so you will likely have to replace the master cylinder anyway.
