&gt; It appears, the entire body was painted white at the factory and then masked
&gt; and painted the bottom color from the bulge down. The front doors and rear
&gt; hatch were subject to some bottom color but the inner sliding door area was
&gt; not and the color change below the bulge ended underneath the door seal.

My '71 seems to be backwards.  Under the white top paint is green bottom
paint.  Perhaps it depended upon the colors involved.
