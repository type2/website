Subject: May PA Vanagon/bus breakfast

I know it's a ways off, but I noticed that the second Saturday of May falls on the 
same day as the Bug and Buggy show at the Lancaster Autohaus.  I'm thinking we might 
combine our breakfast or relocate it to the Lancaster, PA area.  Comments?

Here's the info from the LiMBO events page 
(http://www.bcn_dot_net/~limbo/events.html#May):
