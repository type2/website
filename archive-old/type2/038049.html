Subject: Bus was hit

Helluva birthday present.  I'm driving into Houston on the freeway for a
meeting last Thursday, and everybody just decides to stop.  Ho hum.  The
left lane clears up, which is where I want to be anyway.  I signal and
inch my way out.  I'm two thirds into the lane and a glance down to my
side mirror allows me to see a bozo two cars back try to do what I'm
doing, only he floors it, and (I find out later) he's talking on the
cell phone.  You'd think it'd be hard to miss a bus, but somehow he
manages.

Crunch.

Right into the left rear body panel, just front of the fender.  Luckily
no one's hurt, he's apologetic, and it's just body work.  Things could
have been worse.  Still, it's not what I wanted on my birthday.

Anyway, now I gotta get the work done.  I'm not a welder, and I don't
have the time to learn right now.  I've got leads on some decent local
body shops, but here's my question for those of you who've been in
similar situations:  should I try to acquire the replacement body panels
and such myself, or let the shop do it?  It looks like RMMW (and
therefore probably Bus Depot) have what I'll need.  Any help or
suggestions are welcome.

Thanks for listening,

Jarrett &amp;
Rita, bruised but still strong.
