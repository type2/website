&gt; 3M makes a GREY mounting tape for auto trim attachment- &quot;Scotch Mount
&gt; &gt; Super Strength Moulding Tape&quot; part # 03615 - It sticks VERY WELL and
&gt; &gt; leaves NO residue upon peeling it off.

&gt; 
&gt; It does stick amazingly well. Awesome.

3M has come a long way from their beginnings, when their
