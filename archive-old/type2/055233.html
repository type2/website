Subject: Re: more on my new longblock, 

I had a problem similar to yours about a year after my engine got rebuilt.
The bolt that holds the fan hub on the crank loosened up but what happened
then was the woodruff key failed, probably from the play, it got hammered
into 2 pieces. Once it failed the fan hub spinning on the crank polished it
so nice that I couldn't even tell where the slot was on either piece. I was
on the road at the time on Sunday so I just cranked down the bolt until the
fan stopped slipping and drove home.

My mechanic had just done bearings on the crank since it wasn't worn, all
he replaced was P&amp;Cs and the heads. He said he never took the fan hub off
because it was such a pain to get off with the taper fit. He had only heard
of 2 other people losing the fan like that in his 20 years of VW
experience. The slot on the crank was fine, I think he had to replace the
fan hub, but he repaired it for free so i didn't get all the details.
