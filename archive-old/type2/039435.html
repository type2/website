Subject: Re: damaged nose on '79

With all this talk about getting the nose fixed on buses costing alot of 
money. 

&lt;&lt;Either way, the cost estimate I keep hearing is $1000-$1500 for the job.&gt;&gt;

I am pretty sure i am getting a really good deal since i am paying $300 to 
get my nose fixed on my 71' Today i started cutting the nose off my old 70 
bus pretty rust free nose. I had it almost all cut off till the cut off 
grinder burnt up so now i need to buy a new cutter so i can finish the job. 
Hopefully the bus will go in the shop fairly soon to get its much needed nose 
job. 

Good thing for bras. No one can even tell the nose got hit and was filled 
with tons of bondo.
