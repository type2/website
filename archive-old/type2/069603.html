Subject: Seattle shops, a few questions, too.

Heya johnnys_at_u.washington_dot_edu and other listvolks....

I have a '77 bus in Tacoma where I go to school (it's in enforced 
&quot;storage&quot; over the summer vacation since it wasn't up to the trip here to 
Texas).  When I had some trouble with it, I went to a shop in Seattle 
called TNT foreign Car Parts.  The owner is a guy named Ivan, and I have 
nothing but positive things to say.  I would recommend the shop without 
reservation.

Here's the quick rundown - I got screwed over by a mechanic in Flagstaff 
on my way up to school (&quot;Whoah, man, this mother's burning!  There's no 
way it can make it to Seattle.  I'll rebuild it for $XXXX&quot;), so my 
previous mechanic experience was bad all around.  The van developed some 
problems at the end of school (see my SOSes on the vanagon list), and I 
ended up going to a local Tacoma mechanic, and it was another bad 
situation.  I can't really put my finger on what it was exactly - maybe 
the crowded, dirty shop, or the way he didn't listen to what I would say 
about the van at all, but I decided that it wasn't the place for my van.  
The bad karma ended up costing that mechanic, because I paid the $100 for a 
flatbed to Seattle, and Ivan took up the case.

Ivan listened to what I had done and kept the van over night.  He 
diagnosed problems and got some parts, and then called me and said that I 
had been doing the right stuff and that it looked like it was all work I 
could do.  He asked me if I wanted to come pick it up to save the money 
on labor, or if I wanted him to do it.  I drove the van home, and Ivan is 
now my favorite mechanic I've ever delt with (granted, a limited sampling 
of three + the oddballs who've done inspections and whatever).

I have only had my van a little bit, and still consider myself a novice, 
so you can bet that after I've done the work, I'll be taking it to Ivan 
to get a professional second check.

I'd love to hear about other great Seattle shops, but Ivan has earned my 
respect, and I'll be a loyal customer for quite awhile.  He even gave me 
a discount since it was on a recomendation.  If you end up giving him a 
call, you might mention my name, Ben Heavner, as the college kid from 
Texas who goes to school in Tacoma with the Brown and White '77, and he 
may even remember me.

It was actually a pleasure to work with Ivan, even in the stress of 
finals and broken bus blues.


Now, a couple questions in a similar vein.  My van has two major 
problems, or rather, two facets of a single problem: vaccum leaks.  
What's the best way to go through and find and fix them - I'll be 
replacing all the injector seals, the manifold gasket things, and if I 
can find them, the boots on the manifold (good souces??)  If I can't find 
a source, I'll be duct-tapping this fall.

After the recent thread on backfiring and exhaust air leaks, I am pretty 
sure that there's problems there, too.  I need a new muffler, and I'm not 
sure about the heater boxes.  How do I check them?  Anything more 
complicated than &quot;look for rust holes?&quot;  I don't really have the denaro 
for replacements (~$300 each?!?!), so what are other options - does 
anyone know of good Seattle/Tacoma area pick and pull junk yards that 
would have stuff from a '77?

Thanks a lot in advance!
