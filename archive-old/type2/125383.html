Subject: Re: [T2] Warning - Schadek oil pump on Vanagon - no go

did you actually ask US about this (I know the answer is NO) before posting
this to the list? Our instructions indicate the mods that are required on
the T-1 covers (the dished ones), or you can use a flat cover.

&gt; I can't believe, after all the research I did before and during the
&gt; above exercise, that I never encountered anyone's advice on this problem
&gt; (including AC_dot_net the vendor).  Am I really the first to do this
&gt; dumb-a** task?
