Subject: pushrod tubes

VW dudes,
this may sound silly, but i can't get the cylinder heads off the 1.8L
engine i have.  i removed the 8 nuts and the heatexchangers etc. The
head slides forward off the block slightly, and it seems the only thing
holding the head on is the pushrod tubes. The tubes seem to move some
too, but then stop. what do i do here, i don't want to come onto it and
try pulling the head off and damage something. how do I remove the
pushrod tubes?

thanks for any input i appreciate it :-)
