Hi Bryan,

It will most likely be an exhaust leak.  You say you just replaced the
exhaust, did you take the whole system off or just the muffler?  The head to
heat exchanger connections are notorious for leaking.  I just refitted my
entire system (yesterday) because I had a bad leak and it sounds like new
now.  The list gurus will probably throw up their hands in horror but I used
some high temp RTV silicone on all the joints as well as the new gaskets.
We shall see how it holds up.

&gt; when i let offf
&gt; the gas, it can vary from a small puff to a shotgun type 
&gt; bang.  i just put
&gt; on a new exhaust because my old one was swiss cheese before 
&gt; it fell off. so
