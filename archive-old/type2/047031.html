Subject: [T2] strange noise-78 Bus

I see a lot of threads with this title (sorry) but this one has me
perplexed. It's coming from the rear and sounds EXACTLY like when  the rear
hatch is not closed tightly (not the case) - a loud  annoying rattling when
I hit a bump. I had my wife drive while I climbed in the back - still
couldn't isolate sound. This started about a month ago.

History: - this summer
1) replaced fuel filler elbow (from Australia!)and neck.
2) replaced CV boot AGAIN!
3) removed engine, replaced tranny shaft seal, pilot bearing, main seal.

I've tightened everything I could think of. I have pushed and pulled on
major components and have jumped on the rear bumper to elicit the sound to
no avail.  Only happens while I'm driving. I seem to be missing a pair of
vice grips. Before I go tearing apart the fire wall to find them, is this is
familiar to anyone? Sounds like something bigger is rattleing.  Please
advise.

Thanks,
