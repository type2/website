Subject: Re: [T2] Question about normal running oil temperature

knowing nothing about t4 engines when i bought my 72 i didn't even notice
where the flaps were but the bus ran strong so when i got my 73 which had
flaps in it i put them on my strong running 72 engine as i figure vw put
them there for a reason.  it seems as though the air would just kinda
wander all over w/o the flaps or am i mistaken on this.

David and others,

We may have missed an important point here.  I erased the first post, but
assumed a t4 engine...because Pedro is way south of the border he may have
t1 engine in his bus...

Pedro?  which type engine?

Cheers, dave
