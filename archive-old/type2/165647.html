&gt;No hype, no BS.

But you were apparently given misinformation.

&gt;OK--the API rated SL oils had a zinc &amp; phosphorus index rating of 1000
&gt;parts per million.

No. SL required at least 800 PPM phosphorus (as part of ZDDP), or a 
pass on the wear test of ASTM D 5302 Test Method Sequence VE.


&gt;The new SM rated oils are now 800 parts per million of zinc &amp;
&gt;phosphorous, and can cause problems in a flat tappet cammed engine.

Not exactly. The limits placed on phosphorus and sulphur content by the 
API SM spec only apply to weights 0W-20, 5W-20, 0W-30, 5W-30, and 
10W-30 (which requires between 600 and 800 PPM phosphorus). All other 
weights have no limit on phosphorus (or zinc), but do require a minimum 
of 600 PPM. None of the weights with a phosphorus limit are suitable 
for a VW. There is no specific limit on zinc, except indirectly as a 
part of ZDDP, which is due to the phosphorus limit.

All of this is found around page 61 of this API document:
