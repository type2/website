Subject: Camper and Commercial Mag

    It's on it's way. I just got an email from the publisher and my copies
have been sent today from England.
    For all of you that have pre-ordered, you will be recieving an e-mail
confirming your order shortly. Those that we have all the CC info on copies
will be sent out as soon as I recieve them. I upped my order twice so I hope
I will have enough to do around.
    For those of you who don't know what Camper and Commercial is I'll give
a brief discription. It is a magazine published in England covering NOTHING
BUT Camper and Commercial buses. This month's issue has an arttical in it on
Dan Kinseys 58 Binz from here is the U S and assortted other stories.
