The cold start valve (5th injector) can't stay on all the time unless there
is some SERIOUS miswiring, so if this just came on recently and the FI
wiring harness hasn't been monkeyed with, then that's probably not what's
going on.  However, the cold start valve can certainly leak fuel if it's
worn out.  Usually it will leak a drip drip drip rather than spraying
atomized fuel like it does when it's activated upon start.

It can leak all the time because it's always exposed to fuel under pressure,
even when it's not being used.

I had this going on with my Volvo, there was about 2 quarts of gas in the
oil by the time I changed it :-)

The cold start valve was just dripping raw fuel into the intake manifold all
the time.

&gt; Is the 5th injector turning off like it's supposed to? Fuel in the
crankcase
&gt; is usually caused by a very rich condition; all the fuel can't burn in its
&gt; allotted time so some of it blows by the rings into the crankcase. If the
&gt; 5th injector is staying on all the time, that would do it.
