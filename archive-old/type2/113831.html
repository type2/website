Subject: High Beams Stuck

Could be the high/low beam relay - not an expensive part, IRRC.  But before
you go and get a new one, check the wiring in your turn signal switch and
make sure there are no broken wires.  This happened to me in my 67 beetle,
and it was easily (well, kind of easily) fixed by careful soldering and
re-insulation of the broken wires.  The 67 beetle switch is different from
the bus switch in that, on the beetle, the high beam switch is on the end of
the stalk and the wires cross over the pivot point of the turn signal switch
and thus are flexed every time you operate the turn signal. On the bus
switch, the high beam switch is in the body of the switch, so no wires get
flexed.

To test, measure voltage to chassis, there should be a contact closure on
the high beam wire whenever you pull the high beam switch back.

Dear list,
My high beams will not turn off.  I have a '71 Deluxe and turn signal
doesn't click to turn off the high beams.  Any suggestions?  Thanks.
