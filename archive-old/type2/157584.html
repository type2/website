It's a type 4, 1973, 1700 cc.

When we assembled the engine, we put back all the shims that were in there 
when we took it apart. Then we tried to move the crank in and out but it 
wouldn't budge. Never having built a VW engine before, we used a bar behind 
the flywheel and applied some force to see if it would move at all. That's 
when we some some movement on the needle in the guage, but as I mentioned 
before I think that was simply the flywheel flexing (&quot;warping&quot; was probably 
too strong a word to use).
