&gt; &gt;        I have contacted Espar recently regarding their new units as a

&gt; &gt; keep in mind, is that they are saying their new units run on diesel or

&gt; That's too bad.  They used to have models that ran on gas too.
&gt; Webasto's site isn't entirely informative on that - the only mention
&gt; of fuel that I could find said to contact them if you're interested in
&gt; a heater that runs on gas.

the gas unit is special order but I don't think the price is much
different, I checked it out a couple years ago but the price was
formidible, so keep my BA-4 running.
