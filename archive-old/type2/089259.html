&gt; I have  a 78 engine in my van,
&gt;could I just take the shortblock
&gt;from the 82 and put my 78 heads on it?

Yes. Swap over several 78 parts:
fan housing &amp; alternator, oil filler tube,
motor mount , engine tin, exhaust system.

If these are the heads you just destroyed,
then no :). As i recall, you sucked #1 exhaust
guide into the combustion chamber, but left
the valve, spring, retainer, and keepers,.intact ?
Thiis is most unusual. I can't see how anything
( other than the valve seat ) could get past the
exhaust valve while the engine is running,
much less leaving it intact. Photos ?!
What were the circumstances ?
