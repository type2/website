&gt; Well, after replacing my mechanical fuel pump once, then cleaning
out the 
&gt; tank best i could without removing it, checking fuel lines, and
replaceing 
&gt; the push rod, I have determined that my new mechanical fuel pump has
broken 
&gt; on me, so instead of buying a new one I am saying to hell with the
entire 
&gt; mechanical fuel pump world and going to buy an eletric one, what
type should 
&gt; I buy, how do I set them up, do I need some special pressure
regulator, why 
&gt; did I buy this bus in the first place?

Because it's a great car!

Are you sure that you checked your pushrod length? and extension.  If
it's wrong you can screw up the pump or simply have it not work. 
Check the Bentley manual for the correct specs for your pump.

I've found that mechanical pumps are far less prone to failure than
the electric pumps I've tried.
