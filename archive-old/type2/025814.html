&gt; I have a specific question and need some advise.  I went to get estimates on
&gt; painting my 72 bay window bus and found that I have a rust hole in floor of
&gt; the front passenger side of the bus.  It is where the floor starts to round
&gt; up towards the seat and is rectangular in shape, about 1/4 to 1/2 inch wide
&gt; and 5 inches long.  Will POR15 work for this type of rust?  If so, should it
&gt; be put on the both sides of the floor?  I have some other rust areas about
&gt; the same size, but the rust  has not gone completely though yet.  It will be
&gt; about $300 for the 3 areas that need work if I have the bad sections cut out
&gt; and new ones placed in.  POR15 sounds cheaper, easier and more rewarding if I
&gt; do it myself.  Any help is always appreciated.

While it may be possible to plug a hole with fiberglass (not with POR-15,
though; that's a paint and it's kinda hard to paint air), think: This is a
floor patch. Floors get stepped on, so you're going to need metal in that
area. 

In your case, you're lucky because the holes are small. You can cut out the
rusty areas, make a metal patch for each and attach it with sheetmetal
screws, then take the Bus to a welding shop and have them welded in. Since
the welding is the easy part, it should be fairly cheap. Then paint the
whole thing with POR-15 and you're done.
