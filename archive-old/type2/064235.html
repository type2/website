Ernie:

I don't think you need three batteries, it sounds to me like your auxiliary 
battery is shot--time to buy a new one.

There follows a short lecture on auxiliary batteries for busses:

There are two types of batteries that we are likely to put in our busses, 
starting batteries, and deep-cycle (marine) batteries.

Automotive starting batteries are only designed to cycle about 10% of 
their total capacity, and to be recharged quickly from the 
generator/alternator.  They will be ruined quickly if cycled more deeply 
often enough.  They are great to start your bus, but not for running 
anything very long with the engine off.

Deep-cycle batteries are designed to cycle up to about 80% of their total 
capacity.  Their capacity is rated in amp-hours.  This rating is generally 
based on a 20 hour rate, so if the battery is marked 100 amp-hours, then 
it will provide 5 amps for 20 hours (without recharging).  They should 
not, however, be drained below 50% of capacity very often, unless you 
want to buy a new one.  In any case, they will not usually last more than 
a few years at most.  You want a deep-cycle battery to run your stereo, 
interior lights, computer, fridge, etc. when your engine is not running.

You do not get out what you put in:  For every amp-hour you use, you 
will have to recharge about 1.25 amp-hours to return the battery to the 
original state of charge.  So take the amperage of your gen./alt. minus 
whatever you are using while you drive (headlights, stereo, etc.) to figure 
out how many amps you have left over for charging your auxiliary 
battery.  If you are on the road for a few hours per day, there won't
be any problem, but if not, you only have so much juice to use!    

To charge both batteries, and to have them automatically switched when 
the engine is turned off, you will want to get a &quot;dual battery charging 
system&quot; (battery isolator).  JC Whipme (Warshowsky Company) has 
them for thirty bucks (usual disclaimers), but you can get them at most 
FLAPS and trailer stores for a little more.    

I think I got all of this straight, someone please correct me if I'm wrong, 
or left something crucial out!

.....be on the road in no time.
