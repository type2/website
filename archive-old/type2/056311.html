Sam,

Overriders where not put on Aussie buses as far as I know. At least 
I've never seen them. In fact I didn't know anyone had them 'til I 
saw a movie with Tom Selleck driving a bus with overriders. 

&gt; the reason is that the overriders are not on my front bumper and the parts are
&gt; in the garage. Should I fix the overriders or leave them off.

A matter of personal choice or compliance with laws I would think. 
Take your pick. Personally, having never seen them on a bus, other 
than in pictures, I don't like the look of them.
