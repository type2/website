Subject: Re: [T2] cam questions

I'd think an engine that is  going to spend a lot of
its life up around 4k+ would constitute 'going
there'...

I know we're talking about a cam, but thats why the
type4 bus engines are designed to see around 40
degrees total advance - to deliver power up high,
right?

just blabbing,

A *very* mild cam might help a little on the

&gt; really going to go there in a bus?
