&gt;Also anyone know of a good way to cob job the rust holes especailly the
wheel wells and floor boards and runners, I have some sheet metal riveted
down but need to plug up any leaks.

I did this one time, and it worked very well.
Spread some roofing tar over the hole, and then pop rivet attach a sheet
metal cover over the goo.
Also, there are patches that are sold in the roofing department of
hardware stores. These are rolls of a flat sticky sheets that can be laid
down, and then the sheet metal gets pop riveted on top. Both systems
worked for me, but do nothing to stop further internal rust growth, since
many rust cancers are just that.......... cancer. They continue to spread
unless cut out.
