At Transporterfest (my 1st VW event) I saw a bay window bus in which the
owner put a fixed plexiglass window over the hole in the roof.  With a
full size bed in the back, it must be awsome on star filled nights,

&gt; hello all,
&gt; i have a 75' camper westy, i was wondering if it is possible to 
&gt; remove &gt; the poptop (only orig. roof showing) and install a sunroof off
of a
&gt; doner bus or install some sort of ragtop (i think the sunroof and 
&gt; ragtop&gt; are two different setups?) in the hole in the roof. anyone know
how 
&gt; to&gt; go about the whole deal? any online resources that document such
&gt; conversions? i have checked the archives too, didn't help in this 
&gt; case.
&gt; any advise or info would be greatly appreciated.
