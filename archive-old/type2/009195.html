&gt; I believe your problem is that the rear end of your Westy is
sagging.  I had 
&gt; the same problem until I reset the rear torsion bars to raise it
back up. 
&gt; The angle shifted back and I have no problem looking out the rear
window.
&gt; With the rear up, the front end in front of the axle angles
lower.Also, 
&gt; when fully loaded with passengers and gear, the front end is now the
one that 
&gt; tends to bottom out first.  

This may be true, but be careful!

In a properly adjusted bus, you cannot see the horizon in the inside
rear view mirror.  You can _almost_ see it, but if you can, the rear
is too high.  A jacked up rear end will result in strange handling,
faster tire wear, and CV joint/boot failure.

An unloaded bus normally points up a bit in front.  Put a 170 pound
driver and passenger in the bus and it should be level, measured on
the sliding door sill.  The reason for this is that VW assumed that
the front seats would be filled first, and their load is carried
entirely by the front axle.

If you adjust your torsion bars, resist the urge to crank in a couple
extra degrees of lift.  You won't be pleased with the result!
