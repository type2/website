Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Injection Woes.....

Most of what I have to say pertains to encouragement &amp; advice, only a
little will help right now for troubleshooting. First off the FI
system on a bus is fantastic (when in good shape) &amp; will give many
years of good service. One thing to know about it is that no amount of
&quot;tinkering&quot; will get it running well. Sure, you might get lucky, but I
sure don't have that luck. The Bentley has a fantastic troubleshooting
section just for FI. The only diagnostic tools you need are a
volt-ohm-meter, vacuum gauge &amp; FI pressure gauge. Just follow the
instructions &amp; don't skip a step. it will just cost you in the long
run.

Enought preaching. on to my feeble suggestions. One, have you checked
the temp sensor II? this little $20 part causes all sorts of havoc on
the fi system, &amp; it's easy to replace also. Might want to give it a
shot. 

How does it act when in neutral or park? I sorta wonder how your
timing is. If the problem was just w/ it in gear &amp; not a horrible loss
of power mabey, but I also sounds like a vacuum leak. I would suggest
putting a vacuum gauge on the engine, record it. Double-check your
timing, record it. Get the part # off the distributor, record it. Then
report back to the list. This might help get the ball rolling on your
gremlins.

&gt; I'm hoping some of you gurus can help me with my poor bus......
&gt; 
&gt; 1978 2L FI Automatic Stock (this bus was bought in CA when new.)
&gt; 
&gt; I recently replaced my AFM due to bad testing specs per the Bentely
&gt; manual after ruling out the fuel pump as a problem, checking all the
&gt; vacuum lines, adjusting the mixture,timing is correct, plugs are
&gt; new.
&gt; 
&gt; After I installed the AFM and set the mixture again, I'm having the
&gt; same exact problem.
&gt; 
&gt; When I take my foot off of the gas pedal, or even just let up a
&gt; little, the engine just shuts off. Stop and go has just become stop
&gt; and get frustrated, then restart. It doesn't always start right away
&gt; after dying either. I only have start problems immediately after it
&gt; dies on the road, never any other time. Sometimes I can keep it
&gt; alive by throwing it in neutral and giving it gas throughout the
&gt; stop, then throw it back in first when its time to go, but this is
&gt; no way to drive and it only works half of the time anyways. This was
&gt; the same thing that the bus was doing before I replaced the AFM.
&gt; There is also resistance/hesitation at around 40mph and it won't go
&gt; over 60.
