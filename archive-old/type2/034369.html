Subject: Towing Advice / Safety Advice

Hi there.  This is related to towing buses:

In October, I moved from Ohio to Minnesota, pulling the '79 bus behind the
jeep on a UHaul tow dolly, front wheels up.

At least, that was the plan.

Unfortunately, I got stuck on a dead-end street and had no choice but to
turn around in a gravel driveway.

This turned out to be a good thing, because it probably saved my life.
While backing out, the front axle beam broke very badly.

(  Me: &quot;What's that noise?  It sounds like something's breaking&quot;

   My friends: &quot;That's nothing. That's just gravel.  Keep backing up.&quot;  )

Now, I'm in Minnesota,and the bus is in Ohio with a busted axle.
(Thanks to all the people who helped get it towed to Streetsboro for fixing!)

Thank God that the axle broke in a bad towing mistake at 1 mph instead of
at 60 mph on the interstate.  It was probably ready to go anyway, but you
couldn't tell by just looking at it.

I recommend that you don't do what I did.
For towing, get all 4 wheels up off the ground.  Pay a few extra bucks if
you need to.

Anyway, I am getting that axle replaced and will be bringing the bus home
to sunny St. Paul this spring.  

I will probably tow it.


A Poem To everybody: 

	Don't do what I did.
	Even if your bus is **magic** like mine, 
	you can't ignore safety issues like rust and brakes.
	Even Magic Buses get into bad accidents.
	Check the integrity of the metal up front.  
	When was the last time you looked at your steering parts?
	In a twenty or more year old car, you can't assume that
	Everything is okay.
	And don't ever drive with bad brakes,
	Because my wife and kids might be in the car in front of you.
	And I don't want you to kill them.    

Okay, so it wasn't a poem.  But maybe somebody read it anyway.


Have a nice winter.

&gt;Just bought a '68 camper and need to have it towed home (approx 45 mi one
&gt;way) so we'll be doing the old UHaul and trailer bit I guess unless anyone
&gt;has a better/cheaper/safer idea?
&gt;
&gt;The question I have is whether to tow with the back wheels up (recommended
&gt;for beetles) or do the front wheels up?



&gt; I am of course limiting driving with this potentially dangerous
&gt; situation to a bare minimum.  :-)
