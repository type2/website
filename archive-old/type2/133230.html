well if you take it apart you need new seals when you put it back
together...have never had to change any seals in the 12 years I've owned
auto tranny buses

&gt; at times.. He was general, talking to a newbie in this so Im not sure what

well the 2 liter engine was mated stock to the 010 auto tranny not the 003
and the 003 needs the vacuum for shift points that the Fuel Injection does
not normally have provisions for....just a couple points.

good luck
Bob
