&gt;Platinum's make them run hotter.

I've never tried them and I have no inclination to but I've wondered why they don't work.

As I understand it, the spark plug has two duties: to ignite the air/fuel mixture and to remove heat from the combustion chamber. Aside from the electrical circuit of the ignition system that is expecting a copper core, is it a heat removal problem?
