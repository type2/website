Subject: Can you name this carburetor?

     I am having trouble identifying the carbs on my bus.  It's a dual Weber 
carb set-up.  They are small, similar to what is often called the 'baby 
Weber' but not the same.  It is a single barrel carb.  Specifically, I need 
the needle and seat for one of them.   The seat for the needle is threaded 
on the outside with a 10mm, 1.0 thread pitch, and the port through the seat 
is 2 mm.  They are also just plain getting old so I'd like to find a 
supplier that has full rebuild kits for them.  My local VW shop had not seen 
them before and could not help me.  I have a picture (not a great one) of 
the right side carb installed on the engine if you want me to send it to 
you.
     The only markings on the carbs themselves are &quot;made in Brazil&quot;, the 
funny Weber W, and one plate per carb with the following info:

Left Carb:
W     228092
Lado Nireito
      B     81

Right Carb:
W     228093
Lado Esquerdo
     E     81

     Are these stock at all?  Please let me know if you have any info that 
might help me.  My girlfriend works at a machine shop and they are 'cleaning 
the up' for me so I can hopefully use the needle I have for now, but I'd 
like to see about getting rebuild kits for both carbs.

Thanks in advance,
Jaybird
