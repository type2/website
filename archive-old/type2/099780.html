Subject: Ignition switch trouble

Recently (well, several months ago) I started having problems with my ignition switch.  The earliest symptom was when I turned the key to the &quot;start&quot; position, there was a very slight delay before the starter began to crank.  Less than half a second probably, but noticeable.  Didn't know what it meant or what to do about it.  Then a week or two later I got in, turned the key and... nothing.  I got under the bus, jumped the starter with a wrench and was on my way.  Since I was on my way to Wisconsin, I really didn't feel like addressing what I then figured was a sticky-solenoid problem right at that moment, so I started parking on hills to be safe.  The next half-dozen times I started the bus everything was fine but then the no-start happened again.  After a while, I had to roll-start nearly every time.  I figured I would be pulling the starter and taking it apart when I got home.

Sometime during the trip, I had the bright idea to wiggle the key around in the slot while it was in the start position.  I would turn the key, nothing would happen, then while holding it on I would wiggle it back and forth and the starter would engage.  I have been doing this ever since and while the bus does always start, it is beginning to get annoying.  Also if I don't drive the bus for a few days it takes a scary amount of wiggling/twisting to get the starter to engage.

My guess is that the part of the assembly that makes the electrical contact has arced or corroded over the years and is now not making a good contact.  This is one of the few areas of my bus that I have never explored - back when someone broke into my bus and stole it back around 1990, the ignition wires were cut and the lock damaged and rather than try to repair it I swapped in a whole 'nuther steering column from a '74 (I think) bus.  At this stage in my life I have less access to junkyard parts and would rather try to repair the problem if possible.

So, anyone had this problem before?  I could use some advice.

Thanks,
	-David
