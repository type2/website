Subject: oNCE AGAIN...THE TIRE/RIM CORUNDUM

I have some beautiful audi rims, that fit my van perfectly, and much as I
appreciate the stock reccomendations for tires and van load, they were for the
era of the van, and at that time were the &quot;supreme&quot; knowledge!  But I am going
to go on a &quot;road not taken&quot;, and put the Sway away rear bar set up, with &quot;big&quot;
tires, and modified shocks and front stabilzer bars, and  because I mostly use
&quot;normal Government&quot; paved roads, I have here, I am going to see how this 1800,
works with this setup!  The reason, is that I saw that &quot;short show&quot; on
&quot;utube&quot;, of the VW bus in action, and ...yes I know costs... create my own
&quot;fun bus&quot;because we decide what we want to do ! Just once I want to be in the
passing lane on the two lane mountain roads around here  Will keep you posted!
&quot;Flame wall up&quot;!
