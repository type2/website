Subject: Everybus &amp; why never to work on you bus in a campground

Well I completely enjoyed Everybus. My husband Gary and I met some
wonderful people. Jon and Beth from NJ, Nikki, Jamie, Diana, Bob and
Nancy, and the list goes on and on. Our 9 month old, Kalle, was a very
good camper. The weather stunk but it didn't matter we had fun. Until my
husband decided to WORK ON THE BUS.

Picture this: everything is going fine, we carabus to the show in
Farmington have a great time then head back to the campground. We had
planned to spend the night Sunday and head home Monday. We get back and
talk to Bear a little while (he's the one that got towed in) and Gary
decides to adjust the dual carbs on our bus. Everyone is standing around
watching him work and I guess the pressure was just to great :) All the
sudden Gary says, &quot;Oh that's not good.&quot; The locking nut on the linkage
is stripped. Not to bad you might say! That is until he tried to turn
the linkage rod and it snapped off  at the bottom where it connects into
the ball bearing thingy. (I know my technical jargon isn't great) Then I
hear, &quot;Now I'm screwed.&quot; At that point everyone just sort of backs away
from him.

Now here we are with a 9 month old and everyone who could help us is
gone. We have noones phone number and it's getting dark. Luckily our
friend Jesse was with us and we at least had transportation to go get
parts.

So off to the 24 hr super Wal-Mart. We pick up a drill, bits, awl, file,
table vise, screws to screw it to the picnic table, washers, WD-40, and
this stuff I just happened to see called JB Weld. We tried to drill out
the piece that was stuck inside the ball bearing thingy thinking we
could just screw the linkage back in. But that didn't work so we wound
up using the JB Weld. Never used it b4 but we will always carry it from
now on. Needless to say the stuff held and we were able to get to
Foreign Accents (recommended by Chris who we finally did get hold of)
and they made a better connection that would at least get us home.

We finally left Foreign Accents around 11:30 and made it home around
8:00 tonight. My husband Gary, my daughter Kalle, our friend Jesse and
myself would like to thank Chris for all his help and going way out of
his way to make sure that we got home tonight. We'd also like to thank
Randy and Scot at Foreign Accents for taking our bus right away and
making sure that it was fixed enough that we would get home.

We had so much fun despite our adventure. NEVER work on your bus in a
campground on a Sunday unless Everybus is still going on!!!

Sharon, Gary, Kalle, and Gunthor the wonder bus
