Subject: Contacting Gov. Re:oxy gas?

Hello all,
        Just got some real valuable information from Bill at VW Heaven
regarding the oxygenated gas concerns.  Apparently this is a real tangible
problem, (I mean, you hear stuff, what to believe?) sort of an Andromeda
Strain effect on gas lines.  Has anyone made any individual and/or
collective attempt to contact authorities in the Gov't (Reps and Senators
notwithstanding) to try to convince somebody that exploding cars aren't
environmentally-friendly either?  Let me know.  Wish to avoid bandwidth
traffic so please contact me email stylie.  Thanks.
