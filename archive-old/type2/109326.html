Subject: RE: [T2] Cookin' the hub - it's done, anyone want a bite?

Hmm....   Coming in on this thread a little late, but I would assume you are trying to remove a stuck bearing?
If so, the idea with heating them we have used many times with success is two fold.
Firstly with old bearings heating up just the hub quickly you are hoping to break any rust etc causing the bearing to stick to the hub, and secondly if you are QUICK, you are trying to heat the hub on the outside only and get the bearing out before the heat transfers to it.
