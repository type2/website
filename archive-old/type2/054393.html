Dear Sir,

    Firstly I would like to apologise for the problem yesterday. However I
would suggest that you are better to contact the MD of a company than
spread, what is liable information on the internet.

    You placed the order with a senior member of staff. They had the order
in hand (although we did not have CV Boots in stock) the order was to leave
JK on the 5th (today) by courier at no extra cost to you. So tomorrow you
would have had a full order arriving by Citylink. The second person you
spoke to is a junior member of staff and should have passed your call onto
the person who you placed the order with.

    At Just kampers we process some  30,000 mailorders per year. It is rare
that a problem arises but Kerry and Mark Reynolds as owners clearly state
(in the front of the catalogue) that they want to hear from customers with a
problem so that they can sort it out in person.

Again I apologise for the problem, but believe that a personal call this
morning to Mark or Kerry would have resolved the matter and you would still
have had the parts for Thursday.

Mark Reynolds
MD, Just Kampers

The replies to the KamperChat at www.justkampers_dot_com will confirm that this
has been a rare hiccup that could easily have been avoided.
