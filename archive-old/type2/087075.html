Subject: Re: [T2] advice on what to do about a destroyed head and piston--75
 Bus

&gt; The valve seat on my #1 intake valve (75 F.I. Bus/1.8L) very suddenly and 
&gt; loudly decided to give out and when I finally opened it up to look I saw 
&gt; that the shrapnel from what was probably the seat itself gouged serious 

when I did a similar thing before I had the $$ for a full rebuild I 
put a piston/cyl and a head on and drove it many thousands of miles
afterwards, rebuild was for other reasons 
&gt; 
&gt; On the face of it I need a new head and piston, but...

piston and cyl should be matched

&gt; is there any way to check without too much trouble if anything else is 
&gt; damaged?
&gt; Is it ok to simply replace one piston and leave the the other 3 alone?

you can get away with it but not DM

&gt; What about the head: ok to touch one and not the other? (I'm pretty sure 
&gt; that the PO replaced the other head about 15,000 miles ago) Is a used one an 
&gt; option here or do they have to be mated?

they should be same size but not required to be bought at same time

&gt; Is this the time to think about a replacement engine--hurts to write that 
&gt; since everything was going so well till then... Cost?

when you get an engine is when you start planning the replacement if you
plan on keeping it a long time

BTDT, good luck
