Hello All --
While I rooting around inside the engine compartment of my girlfriend's 77
bus trying to investigate a high idle problem (checking for vacuum leaks,
etc.), I found a loose wire back behind the #3 cylinder (that's the one at
rear left, right?).  The loose end has a small 3-prong plug, while the
connected end meanders down around and under the central area of FI
components -- I couldn't determine where it actually goes to exactly.  The
wire casing, although very greasy black, seemed to have a light brown or
tan color.  Does anyone know what this might be for and if/where I need to
reconnect it, and (a stretch) could it be FI-related and attributable to
the high idling thing?  (It doesn't idle high on start-up, just when warm
and been driving awhile.)  Thanks for any input!

Travis
