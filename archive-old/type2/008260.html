I'm working on my '72 Westfalia and the part of the pillar at the rear of the 
driver door is badly rustes and need to be replaced. The rusted piece is the 
part that goes from the jackpoint to just above floor. I haven't been able to 
find this piece. Can anyone help me? 

The same for the pillar in front of the rear driver side wheel.

Thank you all.
