Subject: master cylinder install success(kinda)

Got the new master cylinder installed in my bus amazingly easy.Bench bled it
and when I put it in the brakes worked real good.The brake fluid was kinda
nasty though so I was gonna bleed it just to be safe.( im not sure I really
needed to cuase the brakes worked great).Anyway bled the left rear,then
right rear.Moved on to right front everything good.Got to left front,and
whoever had bed it last crossthreaded the bleeder screw when they put it
in(why did they completely remove it anyway).Anyway lots of thread came out
when I loosened it and now it wont tighten at all.So now Im waiting on a
rebuilt caliper.Anyway to tell the difference between a gerling and an ate
caliper.The place I ordered i from ordered one of each for me and is going
to let me return the one I dont need.So now the usual question,how hard is
it to replace a caliper?
