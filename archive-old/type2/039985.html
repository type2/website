Jeff,

In California, it goes according to state law, and superceded by local law,
if any exist.

In our (California state law) case, the answer is:

No rear seatbelts okay.
Buddies can drink beer okay in the &quot;cabin&quot;.

Not recommended.

&gt; I know this question was asked a long time ago but I can't remember what
the
&gt; final answer was. I wondering about the legalities of driving with
&gt; passengers in the back of my Riveria. There are no seat belts in the back
on
&gt; the bench seats by the table, but I didn't really think this mattered
&gt; because I thought the camper was considered an RV. Also if it is
classified
&gt; as an RV does that mean that passengers in the back (as far away from the
&gt; driver as possible)are allowed to drink beer while on the road? I live in
&gt; Canada so things might be different up here in the great white north but I
&gt; just thought I would check things out before I depart for the weekend.
&gt;
&gt; cheers...
