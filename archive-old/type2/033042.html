Subject: Administrivia: Payment for Steve Dolan 

Volks,

The attached was posted on vintagebus.  I must admit I have been somewhat
remiss in reporting,  I intended all sorts of things, but I am just not
the finance officer I ought to be :-)

Executive Summary:

The current state of the list finances is excellent.


The Full Report:

Last spring, when we started on the new server, I put out a call to the
type2 list for contributions.  I should have posted to vintagebus as well,
but was plain not thinking (I am famous for it :-).  The response was
overwhelming! within a few weeks I had $1,400 in the 'kitty'!  Now, the
bill from Digital Galaxy Networks is $104/month and we spent $200 on the
hard drive for the computer, so I am figuring that the kitty will be empty
in March, and I will let both lists know at that time, but at present we
are still running on last years contributions.  

                           H Steven Dolan
			   Co-administrator, type2 list

&gt; &gt;  How do we get funds back to Steve for his paying the server and s/w
&gt; &gt; ect?
&gt; &gt; Great idea might be a raffle at BBBIV on a special item with proceeds
&gt; &gt; going
&gt; &gt; to Steve. What do you guys and gals think?
&gt; 
&gt; I think that it is a capital idea!  I don't know the state of the list
&gt; coffers, but suspect that they could use a boost.
