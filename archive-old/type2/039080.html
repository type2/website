Subject: Wipers

 Hi All
 I have looked in the archives, and have not found a concrete 
 answer.  Is the standard wiper switch in late bay window busses 
 adaptable to delay wipers?  Specifically, can it be configured to 
 have the down position?  Also, does anybody have a schematic or 
 description of how to connect a delay relay into the wiper circuit?
 
 Thanks!!
