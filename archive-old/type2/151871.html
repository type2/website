Mark,

Don't even think about it....Unless your garage is empty and the
walls are made of something so you can do a complete washdown...otherwise, 
you will be finding sand in places you didn't even know existed.

....and sand is *very* bad for everthing else you might want to do in your 
garage...like rebuild and engine.

When I sandblast outside, I close every window in my house, the garage, 
the shop, and put all other cars away.  

It absolutely goes everywhere...and anywhere...including the dust.

You've obviously never lived in west Texas during a sandstrom&lt;grin&gt;.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Answer: empirically test the question &quot;how bad would it be if I did a
&gt; little sandblasting in the garage?&quot;
