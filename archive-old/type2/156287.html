Subject: RE: [T2] tires

You won't be disappointed in the Hancooks.  I've got them on the  front.  But those Bridgestones are nice tires also.  I think  they're a bit more expensive new.  They are steel belted.   These will probably last as long as the Hancooks on the front.   I'm anxious to see how they all wear.  
  
  I noticed that Wally World has a marine deep cycle battery for  $69.  I may try one of those for my aux. battery.  I've got  to get my built-in battery charger working.  But I like your idea  too.  I thought about that.  I'm going to order the relay  soon. And put in some kind of stereo.  I've got the speakers but  haven't decided on a head unit yet.  But then there are so many  things to do....
  
  Cheers...KR

Busdepot.  Just need to get my battery working again to then drop them all
off at my mech's shop and get them installed along with a brake job and I
will be rolling.

Don't ask about the battery, I hate it.  Even had the place I bought it
charge it up again. Lasted a day.

I have a solar powered unit from the Battery Minder people that once I get
it all hooked up it will keep the main battery and the one with the inverter
(that I will install) all juiced up and going.  I am wanting to run the
internals off the 2nd battery.

This is on a 78 Riviera FI Bus..fyi
