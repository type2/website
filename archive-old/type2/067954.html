&gt;Thirdly, since this will be the mid of winter, I can already hear whining
&gt;coming from some of you about the cold, blah, blah, blah.  Should we try
&gt;something new and all get together and maybe rent a cabin up in the
&gt;mountains?  Input/votes?

Alright already! You get my drift!

I'm going to go to a HUGE chalet today and see how much they want for 
it - it's called the Ullr Lodge. Ullr is the Norse God of Skiing! VERY 
NICE!

I'll also try the Asgard Chalet.

HEY!  I'll throw in FREE cross country ski lessons!
