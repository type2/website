Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof idea's for 71 bus

&gt; &gt; Buy power sunroofs for added convenience with a switch for the rear roof
&gt;
&gt;I had that same thought the other day when I found a Renault Fuego in the 
&gt;wrecking yard with a perfect power
&gt;sunroof. On the car, it looks just like a split window bus rag top. I 
&gt;almost convinced myself that I needed to
&gt;put it on my 66 hardtop Deluxe bus...... but reality kicked and I left it.

I know the top you're talking about. I remember them back when the cars 
were still on the road around here but they must have gone to the crusher 
directly because I've never seem one in the yards. I've got a late 50's 
Beetle ragtop in my '65 Beetle. It is far from complete. Hopefully it will 
be as nice as I think it will be.

I REALLY like the full length ragtops that replace the rear window as well. 
When I'm richer in another lifetime.

If I had a steel top bus I'd seriously consider a sunroof be it steel or 
&quot;rag&quot;. Seriously consider it before I did any cutting too! &lt;grin&gt;
