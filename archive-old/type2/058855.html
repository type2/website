cheers volks,

I am curious if anyone on the list has a pick up with an expanded wooden
(plyboard) tray like the one here
http://www.bulli_dot_org/t2ig/archive/brochure/6708-1/page2627.html
I have a 1973 version of the one featured in this VW T2a Sales Brochure.

I had thought that it was non-orignal, so was very surprised. Did you
guys in the US ever get something like this?

a big thanks to the Community of Interest T2 for putting the brochure
up.

regards

david
