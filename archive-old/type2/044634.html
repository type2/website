Subject: [T2] Bus hesitates still

Ok, I had to find a timing mark indicator at the junkyard, and yesterday I 
was able to time my '78 bus. Anyway, I posted a question a few days ago about 
my bus hesitating really bad, and a few responded asking if I'd checked my 
Vacuum Advance, well, it works fine. I'm now off to troubleshoot the fuel 
system. Anyone else have any ideas?
