It's hard to advise you exactly what to do here; these decisions are so
personal.  Do you absolutely need the car as a daily driver, or do you have
another vehicle?  Do you want to learn to do your own work and are you
willing to try, or do you just want a car that works without worrying too
much how it gets in that condition?  Is money tight or are you a dot-com
millionaire?

Actually, that compression isn't *to* bad and I'll bet lots of listees are
driving vehicles with numbers worse than the ones you have.  If everything
else is OK, (ignition/fuel) that engine should put out enough power to get
you home.  IF you have another car to drive and IF you're willing to try
fixing it yourself, (if you have AAA that's a bonus) then I'd risk it
driving it home and working on it in the driveway.

The variable compression may be an artifact of the fact that the car has sat
for awhile and could improve with a diet of regular driving, frequent oil
and filter changes and, maybe, a dose of Marvel Mystery oil or somesuch.

Replacing pushrod tubes can usually be done with the engine in place and
doesn't involve much disassembly.

The melted wire might be a result of the ignition switch replacement; this
might be something you want to have fixed by the shop, but if you're SURE
you won't have to kill the engine on the way home (or you have that AAA
membership) you might want to chance the drive and fix it along with the
other things.

This is free advise, and you KNOW what they say about free advise!!

&gt; The bad news is, the compression is not good: 100-135-135-100. Also, it's
&gt; leaking oil bad on one side--he said the push rod tubes need to be
replaced
&gt; (the PO had just finished doing one side but didn't get to the other).
And,
&gt; there is a problem with the ignition wiring. The black wire on the left
side
&gt; of the engine that I guess is supposed to go to the coil is not connected
and
&gt; looks melted. He said that will need to be looked into if the bus is ever
to
&gt; start without a separate wire hooked from the coil to the pos. terminal on
&gt; the battery.
&gt;
&gt; So what do I do now? He's working up a price on a rebuild, I told him I
might
&gt; just drive it home. Would it make the drive home w/low compression? It's
only
&gt; about 10 miles, but there are some big hills to go up, unless I go the
long
&gt; way.
