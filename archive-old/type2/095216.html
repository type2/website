Subject: Re: [T2] fuel pump/FI question of the day


I believe someone earlier today mentioned that the fuel pump should NOT run 
until air is drawn through the AFM, consequently moving an internal flap to 
a position that triggers a sensor, telling the pump to run.

	Eron


&gt;
&gt;On a stock '77 bus, when you turn the key to the first (accessory) 
&gt;position, should the fuel pump run indefinitely? At all?
