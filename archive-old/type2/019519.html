&gt; Dosent a 78 have the later style square exaust ports? If it does you'd have
&gt; to upgrade your complete exaust, everything after the heads, i think. I dont
&gt; remember when they switched to the square port.

Square ports started in 79, Ah do believe. :-) I'll double-check when I
get to the negotiatin' stage. I'm still trying to find out what my
options are -- they are so many and so varied.
