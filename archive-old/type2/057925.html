Subject: ATE brake pads $18.95
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I just got a steal on some ATE brake pads for '73-'85 Busses and Vanagons.
They are the original-equipment supplier to Volkswagen, and usually sell for
about $50 a set.  Now, $18.95 per set (plus $3.75 shipping if ordered
separately, or about $1 shipping if added to an existing order). I only have
20 sets, and can't get more at this price, so I'm going to make this a List
Members Only offer rather than advertising them to the public.  Call (215)
234-VWVW if you'd like a set.  If you already have an account set up with
me, you can e-mail your order, or fax it to (215) 234-0890. (By the way, I
also have those European made '72-91 wheel cylinders again, for $8.95 each.)

Thanks,
