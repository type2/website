Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum advance: dizzy requirements vs. actual vacuum

Joe:
Single vac distributors do not use manifold vacuum so that number is irrelevant. Where they get the vacuum from is PORTED vacuum, which is a port in the venturi toward
the throttle butterfly. This gives virtually no signal at idle and MORE than manifold vacuum (theoretically) when the throttle is cracked open.
You could check it with a tee in the vacuum line, but the really best way would be to check it under operation.(With a helper or a really long hose!)
The dual vac advance is a horse of a different color. The retard side DOES use manifold vacuum. At part throttle coasting or high rpm steady driving where the manifold
vacuum begins to equal the ported vacuum, the retard side pulls back the advance somewhat and this will control bucking.
(Karl von Salzen has described it here and does a better job of explaining than I do!)
I feel the dual vac advance is a superior system, though I'm certain its original purpose was meeting smog tests.

&gt; &gt;You probably should say what dizzy and carb you're using.
&gt;
&gt; Good point, Andrew.
&gt;
&gt; To the extent this information would affect the expected manifold vacuum: it's a stock 1600 single port engine, with a 30/31 carb
