Mike:

&gt;Along the way, I discovered that the engine is actually a GE ('79) case,
&gt;complete with the Hall sensor at the flywheel and that the EGR tube to
&gt;the nonexistent catalytic converter (or whatever had been down there)
&gt;had been cut just below the tin. This was probably due to the
&gt;installation of the aftermarket exhaust system, which I remember as
&gt;being pretty quiet.

The hall sensor suggests that you might have a California L-jet setup, but
that is not consistent with having EGR.  Do you have an O2 sensor?  Do you
have the funky drivers side heat exchanger (looks completely different than
the passenger side)?  I have a stock '79 california (GE) engine and there is
no EGR system at all.  There is a catalytic converter that runs parallel to
#3 and 4 head, O2 sensor and hall sensor ignition.  The '79 california setup
also does not use the resistor unit.  I don't think that the '79 Federal
models used an O2 sensor.

 &gt;1. Will the engine or FI suffer because of the removal/alteration of the
&gt;catalytic converter or is this the equivalent of a heat riser ?
&gt;(assuming that the van had a catalytic converter). Can I simply
&gt;fabricate a plug(s) and leave this tube off ?

I'm not an authority, however, I know that the stock ECU for the '79
california setup is looking for the signal from the O2 sensor to adjust fuel
mixture.  You should check to see which ECU you have.  I believe the
california ECU exchange part number is CU 104 X (manual trans) or CU 105 X
(auto trans).

&gt;2. Are there any advantages to trying to find the proper coil and
&gt;distributor to utilize the Hall sensor and thus the breakerless ignition
&gt;system ? Or are other parts of the FI system unique to this system ?

The hall setup (breakerless) is really nice.  No points to wear out and
adjust which virtually eliminates timing errors.  Once you set the timing,
it stays there, unless you have distributor wear.  Bentley says that you
have to have a special coil (part # 211 905 115C) to run the breakerless
ignition.  I called my local VW dealer and they say that that part number
has been superceded (should I believe them?)by coil part number 211 905 115B
which costs $72.  

&gt;5. I cannot find the Probst fuel injection book for Bosch systems. Does
&gt;anyone have an extra copy they would like to sell ? Please pmail me if
&gt;so. Dirty/used is the best !

I'll bet amazon_dot_com carries Probst.

&gt;6. The exhaust manifolds from the heads have lost the protective sleeve
&gt;which covered them. I recently thought I saw a thread about wrapping
&gt;these with a asbestos type material, but could not find the thread in
&gt;archives. Anybody know about this stuff ?

On my bus, only the driver's side exhaust manifold had the protective sleeve
which was pretty much toast.  When I rebuilt my engine last fall, I wrapped
my manifold in some kind of fiberglass exhaust manifold wrap that I got in
the speed section of my local FLAPS.  The stuff is like a thick cloth and
comes on a roll about an inch and a half wide.  I secured the wrap by
spiraling stainless steel wire around the wrapped mainifold.  That damn wrap
was pretty expensive though.  I've recently come across a source for the
material that is pretty reasonable.  You can order the stuff from Cotronics
Corp, 3379 Shore Parkway, Brooklyn NY, 11235; (718) 646-7996.  They carry a
wide variety of hi-temp products for industrial applications, and their
prices are a fraction of what you might pay  ath the FLAPS.
