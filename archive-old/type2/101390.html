Subject: Re: [T2] Calif. &amp; Ariz. Emissions Laws - Conflicting Answers

&gt; &gt;It's been 1973 and older for a couple years.  The 30 years and older
&gt; &gt;fully kicks in this year so in 2004 it will be 1974 and older.

 Not correct. It is 1974 and older starting 1/1/03. 1975 and older starting 1/104 and so on.
The original SB42 was vetoed because of the 25 year drop-off. Kopp had to rewrite it to 30 years
with a 5 year moratorium on 1973 year model vehicles to get it passed.


&gt; I was told by the smog referee that the test will depend on your VIN but I'm not sure how they
calculate it, Karl?

That is a new one on me. Never heard of it!


&gt; Mine ends in &quot;0&quot;, and I did it in 2002 and they told me my next test would be in 2004. If it ended
in &quot;1&quot; would my next test be in 2003 then every two years after that?

Here is part of SB42:

 SB 42, Kopp.  Air pollution:  vehicles:  inspection and
maintenance.
   Existing law exempts any motor vehicle manufactured prior to the
1966 model-year from provisions requiring vehicles powered by
internal combustion engines in certain areas of the state to obtain a
smog check certificate of compliance or noncompliance biennially,
upon transfer of ownership, or upon registration of a vehicle
previously registered outside the state.
   This bill would, instead, exempt from those requirements any motor
vehicle manufactured prior to the 1974 model-year or, beginning
January 1, 2003, that is  30 or more model-years old.

Here is a pdf of the new rules for the Bay area. It also mentions the 30 year rolling cutoff on page
3.

This is straight from the Calif Air Resources Board.
