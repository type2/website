Subject: Re: [T2] Stripes

(Sorry, Larry, to send this to you privately - I'm used to having the 
default reply be to the list....)

&gt;Its one piece of the 3 color stripe package for a
&gt;dark brown mid to late '70s Bus.  The stripes are 3 shades of brown with one
&gt;of them being a kind of rust color.  I'm sure you've all seen one of these
&gt;particular Busses before, I just don't know late bay windows that well to
&gt;know what option package that would be from.

I'm sure everyone who has one knows this, but this edition was called 
&quot;Champagne Edition.&quot;  Along with the nifty stripes, the option 
included carpet, a clock in the dash, sliding windows, brown dash and 
steering wheel plastic, and perhaps a few other little extras (Air 
conditioning?  Mine had air conditioning, but I don't know if that 
was factory or if the dealer installed it).  Mine (which has since 
been painted green and yellow...) is a '78 but I'm not sure if that 
was the only year it was available.
