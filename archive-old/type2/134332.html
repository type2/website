Subject: Bay westie side tent poles

Bay westie side tent poles

Is anyone reproducing them? I have two good tents and the top corner parts
are broken on both. I have not yet compared them side by side to see if I
might be lucky enough to have one good set between the two.

I know I am not the only one with this problem.
