Subject: Re: [T2] Technical Service Bulletins

Tech bulletins are aimed at the shop technicians and service writers.  
Most have nothing to do with anything serious and are  mostly 
administrative in action.  However some have good troubleshooting tips 
in them.  I.e. a recent one on a WC VW for an injector problem.

  It basically said if it walked like a  duck, talked like a duck, looked 
like a duck, shoot the chicken.

The thing was if it was a certain computer code that said the injector 
was bad and certain tests said bad, open a connector  at a certain point 
and clean corrosion on a terminal. then recheck the computer.

These are the kind of notes i  like to find as  well as the tech 
bulletins that say to pull a certain part and replace with a different 
version due to  bad batch.     Guess what will often turn up in NOS 
parts. You guessed it. Those   questionable  parts that now go on a back 
shelf due to lack  of  disposal or return instructions.
