Steve, on way I've found(flames can start now!G!) is to clean both
surfaces(head and valve cover) and apply a thin film of 3M windshield
adhesive(Gorilla Snot, yellow) to the valve covers and one side of the
vc gasket. Let almost dry. Fit the covered sides together and they will
STICK, so be careful to align them perfectly. Then put them on the head
and push the bail wire over each. Tap the bottoms of valve covers to
assure a good fit. This should fix your problem. 

My .021/2.

Chris.
