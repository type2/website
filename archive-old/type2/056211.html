Subject: RE: Engine Replacement cost

&gt;  From: Thom Fitzpatrick &lt;thom_at_vintagebus_dot_com&gt;
&gt; One time I was at the local Porsche shop, picking up some parts, when a
&gt; guy
&gt; who just bought a 911, *cheap* because it had a toasted motor,  ...  
&gt; what does it cost?&quot;  &quot;Anywhere from 8 to
&gt; 12 thousand.&quot; was the answer.  
&gt; 
	Just for perspective when talking to my nephew who is a Porsche
mechanic, about a cheap 
	old Porsche he said that you shlould plan on spending about 10% of
original purchase price 
	EVERY  YEAR, after the first three years, on the maintainance of a
Porsche if you want to maintain the car. 

	We're talking $8k-$12k PER YEAR!

	After the warrantee they need about $7k-$10k on seals replacemtn to
stop them from making messes on the rug!
