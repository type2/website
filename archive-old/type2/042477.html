Subject: rocker arm stud pulled  --HELP

Ok, I am p*ssed! I need your guys help
I was trying to torque my rocker-arm shaft down and I
seemed to have pulled a stud out! It didnt just
come right out it just started spinning. So I started
backing the nut off and the whole stud came out then.
The only part that looks like its stripped is where
the nut was on, not that part that was in the head.
I didnt get it torqued past 10 lbs so I didnt over do it.

What are my options? Besides getting new heads, these
are in decent shape. Can I install a new stud? Helcoil?
These arnt supposed to pull out are they?, it came
out so easliy.
I was hoping to put the engine back in tommarrow,
argh I'am so upset. O well
Any advice send it my way PLEASE
TIA
Alex Wisniewski,
77 Riviera w/79 2L engine
