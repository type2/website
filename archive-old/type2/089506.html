Subject: [T2] Motor changes for the bus


&gt;That's right I forgot the 356 and 912 had the 4 cylinder motors . It's not
&gt;easy keeping up with all that . I don't really want speed , I was just
&gt;curious if anyone had done it . &lt; &gt;
&gt;. The one
&gt;thing that does concern me about the van is how fragile they are at highway
&gt;speeds , how people look at you because you simply can't maintain the speeds
&gt;that everyone else is going . I understand that my 1979 has 70hp and weighs
&gt;5200 lbs , just imagine the earlier ones with even less power . When I do
&gt;rebuild this one , I want to do some upgrades that will reduce the
&gt;temperature of the motor for safer highway travel .

Lack of adequate reserve power to maintain highway speed is a
primary consideration of the engine swap. It is sometimes beneficial
to be able to increase speed quickly to avoid a danger situation,
and to avoid those inevitable tailgaters trapped in your vapor trail.
Underpowerd , at the horsepower peak and too slow for traffic
makes your bus the hazard, not the best situation for traffic flow.
Other drivers are aware of the bus when it's causing the problem.
You must compensate by being more alert and anticipating.
