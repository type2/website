Subject: Re: FS: VW Vanagon--$750

&gt;&gt; For sale: 1980 VW Vanagon, Westfalia Lots of miles (100K on 
&gt;&gt;odometer, driven for 8 out of 10 years since the odometer broke 
&gt;&gt;in 1987) Transmission work needed. Does not go except in reverse. 
&gt;&gt;To be honest, I don't know what kind of work it needs. Worst case 
&gt;&gt;would be a new tranny. I can't even afford to even have it looked 
&gt;&gt;at, so this could be a bargain opportunity for you.
&gt;
&gt;Geez-o-Pete!  If Ron hasn't jumped all over this one, someone 
&gt;should.  I know where you can get a tranny out of an '82 for $200 
&gt;(plus shipping) [that is, if it hasn't sold in the last couple of 
&gt;weeks].  Why couldn't have this one been in St. Louis or 
&gt;something?  :(

Agreed.  This sounds like a very good deal.  I already blew my 
money on another van, so I'm not going to jump all over this one.  
But if someone wants it who is not from that area (Palo Alto), I 
might be able to help them get a good deal on long distance 
transport.
