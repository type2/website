Subject: trip report...well, not really...

Prologue.... heres how to field repair a broken rocker
shaft clip on a cylinder head.... theres a long
rambling after the info... but its how I learned how
to do this:) If ya dont like ramblings, just checkout
the steps... aint takin any legal responsibility, bla,
bla.....


1&gt; remove valve cover 
2&gt; remove rocker shaft
3&gt; assemble shaft as per manual, using as many of the 
stock parts that you can. you decide where to put the
flat or wavy washer... hopefully you have all three...
it goes flat/wavy/flat....
4&gt; compress everything, put a 1/4 in hose clamp on the
rocker shaft... its kinda tricky... real tight
fit....but I HATED takin that clamp off that fuel
line... hey... it was a do or die... 
5&gt; once the clamp is on the shaft, put it where ya
like it, tighten it, put the rocker assembly back on..
6&gt; on the road:)

End Of Prologue......

Hi All...
 This would be a trip report... but since Im no longer
on the VB list, and this is the T2 list... it wouldnt
be appropriate... but this little tid-bit of info
might save your butt sometime, if you run a 1600... as
it did mine Monday morn...
 Ill start this off by stating that Ive been wrenchin
on VWs for over 20 years... no guru by any stretch of
the imagination... in other words, still learnin... as
youll soon find out...
 The truck that I took from Ft Worth, TX to
Alamogordo, NM had a 1600 in it, that I rebuilt. Stock
except for the 009 (puke), header/muffler, air
cleaner, and swivel foot adjusters...  Ran flawless
all 571 miles there... not counting the 8650ft
altitude in Cloud Croft... It was hard for me to
breath... much less the engine:) Anyways... back to
the story... Was headed home to TX on I-20 in Big
Spring... running 55-60mph... when all of the sudden
backfire thru the carb that coincided with RPM was
loud enough it echoed thru the heater tubes... NO
power what so ever... it would idle... albeit rough...
but if you try to give it any throttle... back fire &amp;
dies..... WTF? First thought was I sucked a valve...
but at idle, it sounded just fine, except for a slight
miss... Ive dropped a valve a few times... knew it
wasnt that. So I dive to the shoulder, hit the
brights, look for a good place to park... well there
aint none, so the shoulder it is. Knowing its a valve
(backfire was in time w\RPMs) I pull the passenger
side valve cover, well... everything is in order...
pull the driver side and there it is.... the no4
exhaust valve rocker is loose, so I thought,
adjustment... upon closer inspection (only light is
from a 2AA mini-mag) the clip (still havent found a PN
yet) is missing!!! Dig around inside the head... there
it is, IN 2 PIECES, along with a broken flat washer.
The rocker had nothing holding it in place, and had
finally worked itself plum off the valve stem, letting
the push rod fall outa the rocker... it had beatin the
swivel adj ball reallll bad, glad the metal in the
valve is harder than the adjuster:)
 So what do I do? No AAA, in the middle of BFE, no
cell, I dont carry spare heads, (altho I will from now
on, at least one) After much thinkin/diggin/praying...
found on the side of the road was a piece of what I
think was electric fence wire... in the dark I couldnt
tell if it was SS or galv.... really didnt care. Took
the remaining 2 washers, one wavy, one flat, (there is
three washers, 2 thick flat ones, and one &quot;wavy&quot; that
is made of spring steel, flats ride on the
clip/rocker, wavy is sandwiched tween em to hold
pressure on the both)...
 Well this is what available.... I laugh.... walk
around the truck a few times... now cussing.... but
then it hits me... I rebuilt this engine, I put those
heads together, I installed that rocker shaft.... I
was the last one to put that damn keeper clip on the
shaft... &quot;I&quot; missed it.... it was a 30yo clip that
gave way..... I Mic all journals, check all
sideplay,endplay, plastigage every bearing, ect... but
missed a little clip that was wore out....
A wise man once told me years ago..... &quot;You are the
'mechanic in charge'&quot;. So I take charge...
 Put a brake spoon in the head/valvetrain, push
everthing together, and start wrappin this mystery
wire around the rocker shaft, then start tightening
with pliers.... gotta remember, when doing this, make
sure the wire will go/ride in the slots made for the
clip.... thats what holds it in place... bolt the VC
on.... back on the road:) 
 It worked for 88 miles........ then.... backfire
again... at least I know what it is this time......
 By now Im at a sparsely inhabited area.... so we fly
low thru the weeds to an all night Mom &amp; Pop fuel
stop.... pull the VC... wire has wore clean in two...
not made for those pressures I guess.... 
 Cromagnin instints are fading.... iron age setting
in:) thinkin much more clearer... Duh.... the shaft is
approx 1/4 in (6.35mm?)...a hose clamp will work...
but it will not fit tween the head/shaft... you have
to uninstall the rocker shaft, push everything
together, and hold it there till you can tighten the
clamp, makin sure the bolt on the clamp is facing
towards the VC.... then reinstall...
 It got me home:) and is still running good now... got
all the parts together to fix it tommorow.
 This is really long for a a BS TR... but I really
hopes this helps somone get back home one day.... 
 Famous last Words....&quot;I never seen one of those clips
break either....&quot;
