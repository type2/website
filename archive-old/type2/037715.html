Subject: Importing VW Van into Canada

Hi Volks,

I'm bringing back a FREE 1979 VW van from NH to Ontario this weekend, and
was wondering what will happen when I hit the border.  What sort of
duties/taxes/surcharges are applicable, and what kind of  $$$/credit is
applicable?

I'm towing the van back on a dolly, as the van has no transmission and will
probably be imported as parts, rather than as a vehicle. It will also
contain some westy cabinetry I'm bringing back for another listmember.

Pro's, con's,  suggestions and horror stories welcome. The more info I get,
the fewer surprises there will be on the way home.

Thanks,

Greg Potts,
