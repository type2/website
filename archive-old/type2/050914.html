  &gt; The first thing you should do when you buy a Bus is put an oil
  &gt;  temp gage in the sump and watch what happens.  For my '82
  &gt;  with the new 2.0 to maintain speed on WV interstate.
  &gt;  
  &gt;  55mph - 185F,  60mph - 200F, 65mph - 215F, 70 mph - 230F
  &gt;  
  I agree with John on this.  However, IMHO a CHT gauge is far superior to an 
oil temp gauge.  After all it's the exhaust valves and their seats that fail 
and it's the heads that crack and blow out their spark plugs.  
Not that an oil temp gauge isn't very valuable and important.  I just prefer 
the fast response time of a CHT gauge.  I've seen my head temp get up to 400 
degrees before the oil temp started registering. 
  The big drawback being that CHT gauges are more difficult to install 
properly.
