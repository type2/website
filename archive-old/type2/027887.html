Hello all,

   Well I finally got the ignotion switch replaced. Much thanks to Busted VW 
for getting me the correct parts and to all those on this list that helped 
out along the way. I also got all turn signals working. My high beams work 
but the low beams don't. This is most likely the bulbs which I plan to 
replace thursday.

    Now onto the bigger problem. I have no brake lights. I recently wired up 
a new ignition switch and cleaned up the wiring from the turn signals. Any 
Ideas. The bus is a 71 Campmobile. I am so close to getting her running. Now 
i just need some help from my online friends!

    I hope to hear from you soon.

Cheers,

Joe
