Subject: Re: Mounting spare on front of 74 bus

&gt;   I would like to mount my spare tire on the front of my
&gt;74 bus.  Is there an easy way to do this?

It's real easy. Just buy a kit from busdepot, rocky mtn motorwork or any 
other bus part place. I paid $18. Just pull off the VW emblem, drill three 
holes, mount the bracket, and slap on your tire. In addition to making some 
extra room it might also add some extra protection in case you have an 
accident.
