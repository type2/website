Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Parcel trays

You should check out this really nice, safe and collapsible parcel tray made
with recycled veggie oil containers and nylon plies extracetd from some
195/75R15 passenger tire's exploded sidewall that Tori Spelling used to have
on her Westy. They are on sale on the famous auction site. A real
collector's and comes really handy to store the gallons of 0W65 oil that we
burn.
