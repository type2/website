Subject: [T2] Just quit :(

Hi,
    Haven't been following this list much in the past few months due to
illness and being in the hospital. latest was over Christmas. Will
probably be back in next week but during this break from doctors I got a
chance to drive my bus (75 9 passenger) and that felt good. However my
joy was short lived :(  After about 30 miles and heading home it just
died. Got it towed and checked out what I could ... thought it might be
the coil (original) so swapped that and the wire. Still no go ...it
turns over .. I can smell gas and hear the click click when I push on
the accelerator (ignitors?) but won't start :(  Any ideas on what I
should be checking?  It's a 1800 FI with auto.  Any suggestions
appreciated ... have lots of time but very little money :))

Pete
75 VW Bus ... sadly sitting.
