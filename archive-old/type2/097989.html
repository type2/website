Subject: What should be checked and replaced in my f.i. 

Hello list,

I was going through my box filled with a complete bus
f.i. system for a 79, non electronic ignition, bus
this afternoon. I have gotten most of the pieces
cleaned and some painted. Oh, I sucessfully redrilled
intake manifold stud holes in the manifold runners so
they would fit on 914 2L heads. They fit well. Any
how, I have yet another question. I am already going
to replace the head temp sensor because it was
damaged. Are their any other sensors that are prone to
failure that I should consider replacing. What about
the cold start valve (0 280 170 026 ) or the thermo
time switch (0 280 130 214 )? Are those replace as
common practice?  The tip of the cold start valve is
pretty rusty. Is there any easy way to test the
sensors? I should also mention that I am not hooking
back up the EGR system. Which components can I leave
out with out the EGR? So far in the f.i. I have
replaced all of the gas lines and vacuum lines, the
injectors with new ones, The accelerator cable, the
injector seals with new german ones, the boots that
connect the runners to the plenum, the air filter, The
gas tank and all its ruber fuel lines, all the clamps,
and the head temperature sensor. Is their anything
else that should be replaced? Thanks again for the
help. Because of the people on this list, I am making
progress on my bus. Thanks!!!!!!
