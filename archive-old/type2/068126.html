Having high beams on during the day is good.  It is not so bright 
because your eyes have adjusted to the regular brightness of the sun, 
etc.  It is normal for motorcycles to use their high beams during the 
day so their low beams (more important) light bulbs don't burn out so 
quickly.  Yes, during the night high beams are very horrible to look 
into (and therefore we all turn away, just try to keep your eye on the 
white line on the right edge of the road), but during the day high beams 
are good for being seen.  Especially on dirt/narrow/muddy/steep roads.
