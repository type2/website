I just put one of these in my 78- It's the VDO with a terminal for the
idiot light and a terminal for the sender.  It grounds to the case. 
Instead if t's and elbows  (it's tight with the tin and distributor) ,
get a dremyl rotary tool &amp; a couple of grinding bits (#911, 932, or
8193).
The stock hole must be enlarged by removing the distributor (mark its
position and stuff a rag in the hole). and grinding around the edge of
the tin until you can screw in the sender.  Use a screwdriver as
leverage between the terminals to tighten the sender.  I used a bit of
gasket sealer on the threads. A bead of silicone can be placed around
the sending unit to seal air leakage.  Wear rubber/mylar gloves as you
have to use a finger to work in the sealer.

&gt; 
&gt; so, simply speaking....if the picture of the gauge has 2 pointy things on
&gt; one end, and opposite is the end that fits into the engine....this is a
&gt; dual gauge for the purpose i am seeking?!
