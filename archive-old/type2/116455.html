  At least kids have more of a choice on jobs today then in mine. All I had
was McD's there were no Lowes, Wally Worlds back then. I remember collecting
shopping carts at Gemco, you get a coupon for every one you returned which
you could trade in for goodies at the store.
  Then the organized gangs swooped in and pushed the independents out.
  I have always had high school kids working at my shop for the last 10
years. The problem is once they see what a pain VW's are, the low prices you
have to charge they either join the military or go to TECH school where they
can make serious money at a dealer with-out getting greasy. We have a dying
trade and nobody seems to want to learn this dying trade. Who will be around
in 10 to 20 years to fix these old heeps? And will parts still be available?
I am always shocked at when one of my importers tells me another part is
discontinued.

ronnie  got a good 10 years left in me and enough parts stashed to hopefully
cover that.

John,
Just Think about this----

One day --waaay back when you too were probably one of them &quot; pimpled
faced &quot; kids too---:&gt;)

Everyone has to start screwing up somewhere- and Lowe's is as good a
place as any I guess--

Have Fun with your new toy--

Later,

Terry

 I wouldn't need to ask any of their clueless pimple faced 16 year old
sales associates for help. (I have nothing against clueless pimple faced
16 year olds, I just don't want to ask them for advice on welders!!)
