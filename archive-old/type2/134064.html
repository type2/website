Subject: Re: [T2] Toolkit for bus pickup trip.

I think the first thing to do is establish to what extent you dad is 
willing to repair the bus. Since I know your dad and judge him to be 
a good mechanic, sharp of whit, and generally crafty, he is a good 
candidate for this job.

I would suggest that a supply of spare parts be waiting with the bus 
or packed separately.

General engine room stuff
Plugs
Wires
Appropriate cap, rotor, points for the dizzy. In fact a fully loaded 
009 or 205T would be a good thing to have
Coil
Carb rebuild kit which tend to cover 28 through 34 pict
Vacuum hose and some screws to use to block off vac ports on the carb 
that always fall off
Fuel line, filter clamps, golf tee or pencil
Male and female electrical connectors
some 16 gauge electrical wire
Electrical tape
Wire nuts
oil change gasket kit
Spare bulbs for turn signal, brakes, back up lights
a pile of 8 amp fuses (euro of course )
RainX

Tools
Aside from the obvious set of wrenches, screwdrivers, sockets, etc
1/2 breaker bar of appropriate piece of pipe to go over ratchet.
bailing wire
Duct Tape
wire crimpers
small multimeter
small tack dwell
test lamp to static time or learn to use the multimeter to static time
a piece of sandpaper (120 grit)
feeler gauges
17mm allen wrench cut off and welded to a 17mm socket for tranny and 
RGB plugs. He might not use it but someone else might need it.

Marge will need a supply of knitting needles and yarn to keep her 
busy while your dad rebulds a carb somewhere in the wilds of Nebraska 
:)

Good luck!
Chris

&gt;
&gt;So let's get to the point: What would you pack in your toolbox if it 
&gt;were YOU making this trip???
