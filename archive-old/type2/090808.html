Subject: Need a garage to work, and mentoring in (Greater Seattle)

Hi. I have a type II 78 westy in Mukilteo, WA. Two
days ago, It started running really bad. I checked for
spark in all cylinders (ok), and then compression.
Number three had no compression at all. I am assuming
it is a stuck valve. (could be bad piston, but if so,
would probably hear clanging. could also be rings, but
then I would have at least a little compression. I got
ZERO!) What I need is the use of a place to work on
it, and some guidance, as I am not a VW guru (or any
other car guru for that matter). I live in an
apartment and cannot work on it here, and no relatives
or friends with available space. Please help. I can
pay a nominal fee if necessary. Thank you.
Matt Santori
