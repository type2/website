     Hey! Wheres all the air suckers? I've been in Tennessee for 2 years 
and am realizing that there are not too many Vdubs here. There can't be 
more than a dozen or so on the road around Chattanooga. The 
Good-ole-boys around here must have never had the bug.
     Well this is just hello to any and all &quot;local&quot; (250-300 Mi.) 
freaks. I guess I'm a &quot;newbie&quot; when it comes to maillists but I've been 
a freak since I was 15. Many of my 12 or so VW's have been rustmongers, 
and I'm continuing the tradition with my 71 Singlecab which is 
full-O-holes. She's probably beyond help, but I'm thinking of using her 
for a work truck. The previous owner chopped the sheetmetal out of the 
engine comp to install a late model motor. I would love to transplant a 
GTI or Quantum watercooled into her. I've seen buses on Dead tour with 
GTI and Toyota engines motering over mountains at 75-80 mph. I read 
about a GTI transplant in a later model vanagon diesel and realized that 
if you used the bellhousing and oilpan from the diesel and fabbed your 
engine mounts, it could be possible on an earlier bus. Lemmehear your 
comments.
