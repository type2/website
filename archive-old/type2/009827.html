&gt; &gt;In addistion A board of elected list members could
&gt; &gt;act like a collective ombudsman helping to settle disputes between
companies
&gt; &gt;like GEX or Midas, etc if things aren't right where a subscribing
member is
&gt; &gt;concerned.

Having used AAA's mediator on a C*evy rebuild that overheated within
the first 15 miles, I can see that the only way that a mediator is
useful is when they have the clout to severely affect the business
they are working with.  AAA can do that by taking away that little
&quot;AAA authorized&quot; sign that brings in a lot of wealthy paying
customers.  I don't think that the lists can muster that sort of clout.

Let's concentrate on getting people back on the road, not playing
lawyer.
