Subject: Re: [T2] Caveat Emptor

While my reply doesn't mean disagreement with Cliff, let's expound with a
bit more knowledge as to the why and what of this example and educate
ourselves....

211-945-351A, Bulbholder, Rear Sidemarker

**Available originally from Hella Germany, a very high quality piece
indeed.  Depending on costs and availablity (BTW - it is no longer
manufactured by Hella,) you would probably pay between $8.95 (Bus Depot to
as much as $20 (or thereabout) elsewhere in the &quot;vintage&quot; vw parts world.
If Ron has them, get them while you can, because when they're gone - they're
gone :-(

I can remember a few years back, you couldn't find a Hella made bulbholder
at all.  But with guys like Ron searching the &quot;hinterlands&quot;, he was able to
cough up inventory from some &quot;dusty&quot; shelf here and there.  Kudos, etc.

**Because Hella decided to quit making these several years ago, the &quot;mother
of necessity&quot; being what it is (not to mention the law of supply and demand
[demand being the greatest}), an effort was made by someone to repro these
elsewhere in the world, in this case India in the late 90s.  And since then,
that's where they are all coming from and being distributed by the likes of
CIP1, Mid America, etc., even Bus Depot has them for $4.84 (as opposed to
CIP's $7.95).  Granted, the quality could probably be better.

But therein lies the problem.  As production of even OE manufacturing is
being shifted as I write this to far flung places such as Brazil,
Mexico, Turkey, Hungary, China, India and gawd-knows-where, the quality
(unfortunately) will suffer as those manufacturers do whatever they can to
cut the cost.  Unfortunately, some of those quality standards are being
reviewed by even the OEMs and subsequently down-graded because our
disposable society purchases a new product (such as a vehicle) more often.
The US Air Cooled (and even Wasserboxer Vanagon) Volkswagen Owner, such as
ourselves is becoming a smaller market each day, doesn't have the clout to
have the &quot;original&quot; product readily available as it was 3 decades ago (and
even as recent within the past 5 years).

Outfits like CIP1 have the products like that bulbholder that failed on your
vehicle because in most cases, they *have* to, not because they *want* to.
In an ideal world, original Hella, Solex, SWF, LMB and other quality brands
would be readily available and remember at the appropriate and usually more
expensive price (whatever the market will bear).  But they're not.  So the
&quot;quirky&quot; VW Owner has to make the concerted effort in finding the best
quality replacement knowing that said quality *may* not be the same as the
original.  In some cases, the repro is better made, but that is the
exception, rather than the rule.

On a personal note, I have used these India - made bulbholders myself with
decent results.  I have a pair of these on a friend's (hey, his name is
Cliff too!) 76 Riviera Camper (installed in 1997) and upon recent inspection
while doing something else to his ride, I haven't detected and appreciable
rotting or deterioration as described.  But as with every heads-up post such
as yours, an extra eye will be kept &quot;peeled&quot; to watch it.  It's possible
that the one you purchased from CIP1 may have had a bad batch of rubber at
the time and subsequent production has better rubber (pure speculation of
course).

This is not meant to be a defense of CIP1 (or others), but to inform others
that this is the way it is in the marketplace.  To change it would require
someone with the $$ to step up and make it (and other products), but only if
the market can support it (at the higher costs) in the long run.  In my
view, there isn't enough of a market to do that. Thousands of Bugs, Buses
and other models have gone to their graves being crushed up to reduce the
market to a shadow of what it was in the 70s.  And guess what - it ain't the
70s (or the 80s &amp; 90s) anymore.

In regards to rubber coming from Mexico, Brazil or wherever, there is
quality, EPDM rubber products for our VWs being supplied today and only
after constant &quot;harping&quot; to the manufacturer(s) for better quality.  They've
been slow to come around, but many are starting to get &quot;on-board&quot; knowing
that if they don't put out a better quality rubber product, that they're
gonna be left in the dust.  Granted there are those that still provide only
crap, so it's up to the guys like Ron, myself and others to keep searching
for the better stuff to offer.

To sum it up - &quot;Buyer Beware&quot; is a necessary watchword these days when
getting replacement parts for your VW.  But keep in mind that the majority
of parts content in even today's new VWs are coming from 3rd world countries
and not the &quot;fatherland&quot;.  Quality has suffered because manufacturers are
cheep.  And just because it comes out of Germany doesn't mean it's the best
quality either.

&gt; Basically, the rubber parts on the
&gt; lamp base had &quot;melted-down&quot; and all but disappeared.
&gt; Only el-cheapo parts break-down like that.  I don't
&gt; recall if the original side marker light base was from
&gt; Mexico or Brazil, but I'm sorry I bought it.  A waste
&gt; of cash.
&gt;
&gt; A generalization I will hazard a guess at is any
&gt; RUBBER part from Mexico or Brazil should be an
&gt; immedate AVOID.
