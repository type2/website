My '72 Bus is in GREAT condition, however the PO was one of those guys
that never did anything the RIGHT way, he got it working, but it was a
horrible job.  Such as wires wrapped around another connection and all
kinds of wacky stuff.  And since I'm a perfectionist this really really
annoys me, I gotta have everything done the way VW intended it to be. 
So, anyway, how is the aux heater fan supposed to work.  I've tested it
and it works, but when does it come on?  There's no switch up front, so
if you want it on, how do you turn it on?

Also, my Bus is supposed to have an AC, I think I can get it back, PO
took it out and then never gave it to me when I bought it.  I might be
able to get it from him eventually, but just wanted advice.  Anyone use
these and are they worth the trouble, should I just leave it out and use
windows, or is it a good idea to use the AC?

Michael
