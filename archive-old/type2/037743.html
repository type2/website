Subject: Late to early Bay Window front beam replcement

Hi Volks,

One of my students who volunteers for a fire department called me and
said he knew of a bus that was donated to the fire department.  It was
used for training excercises, and I hate to say it was trashed.  The
roof was taken apart and The Jaws of Life had done their number on this
poor VW.  The engine, tranny and front beam are salvagable.  Will this
complete later beam and all it parts bolt into my '70?  Disc brakes
would be nice to have and it's steering is wonderful.  Thanks in
advance.
