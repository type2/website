Subject: oil pickup stud...conclusion

Finally put the nut and washer on the oil pickup stud on my 1600dp rebuild.  Thanks to all who sent suggestions.  But in the end it was my 3 and 50/52 yr old who saved the day.  I had complained to him that the reason I was angry was that my fingers and hands were to big for what I was trying to do.  He proceeded to tell me that his were smaller and that he wanted to try.  I had nothing to lose so after 10 minutes of practice we both got under the short block and in a matter of minutes
the task was completed.  I was so proud of him!!  We went for ice cream
after :)  Just goes to show, you should frequently step back once in awhile and think about what you're trying to accomplish.
What a relief.  Now I can continue with this rebuild.  More on that at a later date.
