Subject: Re: [T2] I'm gonna pull my engine

You should have no problem removing your engine with these books. Just
remember to do it right, take no short cuts. Also remember safety first.
That engine is not as heavy as a V8 but it can do you some damage if it
takes a plunge on you. I always like to have a second person there
experienced or not just to lend a hand i.e. read the manual as you work grab
a tool if you can't reach it and also for a second set of eyes. Also its
nice to have a second opion to see something you might have missed. All in
all though the type 1 engine is very simple to pull out. CHAD
