Subject: gas heater 

hey fellows,

I own a 71 westy which I took out my gas heater of. The heater was located 
behind the drivers seat. Near to the gas tank, the gas lines were separated 
into 3 parts by a T connector which lead to the heater. I took it apart but I 
need a single connector to link the 2 remaining lines together. Has anyone 
done this before know what size connector to use?
thanks

J.D.
71 westy
