Subject: Cockpit partitions, cool, clear

        David, all,
        Refrigerator sections in some markets and loading docks on some
air-conditioned buildings here in California sometimes have a thick,
limp and very clear plastic sheet partition. The plastic is in ribbons
8&quot; (200mm) to 12&quot; (300mm) wide, with an inch or two overlap. 

        Try a commercial refrigeration or store-fixture place to buy it
ready-made or make your own from thick vinyl (pvc) (?) sheet. Thick 
polyethylene would probably work as well but not have the crystal-clairity.
Besides hardware and industrial supply places, a convertable top shop
might be a source.

        I associate the 'greasy' feel David mentioned with the polyethylene/
polypropylene varieties of tranlarent/translucent plastics. Vinyl (PVC) is 
smooth and shiny but has a different 'feel'. OTOH, vinyl with Armor-all
or other plasticizer treatments might feel quite greasy.

        My single-cab has, effectivly, a high-quality partition and
runs toasty-warm.

        Bill
