Subject: loss of comprssion in #3 cyl.

Bummer!

#3 cyl. has only 85 PSI while the rest are:
#1=125 PSI
#2=125 PSI
#4=125 PSI

It has a loss of power when climbing hills. I was just going to replace the
plugs and while they were out do a compression test. So there must be some
leak in there. This is in 79, air cooled, fuel injected, electronic
ignition, 2.0 liter, long block engine I bought about 2 years and 25,000
miles ago.

Do you think It needs to get dismantled to inspect the heads, valves? Would
you let it get worse while closely monitoring before taking any action? It
doesn't use hardly any oil. The spark plugs all have good color.

Thanks for the advice.
