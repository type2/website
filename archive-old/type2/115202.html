Subject: RE: [T2] wish me luck

&gt;I'm not looking to start a public battle with you here, but I don't think
&gt;that it is fair to make one sided statements to a public forum such as the
&gt;Type II list.  These type of things should be handled between the two
&gt;parties involved, not everyone in the world!


Well, since you decided to bring it back to the rest of the list yourself, I 
suppose you didn't
mind that so much after all.

I said we have trouble sometimes getting mail in the island as a way to just 
deal with
the situation. What ever happened to that SECOND Cashiers check you sent 
out, you
think that magically got lost in the mail as well?

There was a long period of time between when you said you would resend the 
check out
and when you found out that your delivery guy was going to jail. So, you 
either never sent the
second check, or never sent either. Or they were both magically lost in the 
mail, and then the
delivery guy was sent to jail on top of it.

Your either the victom of extremely bad mail service and luck with choosing 
a car carrier, or I was
a fool to just trust you. Either way, im sure you and anyone with half a 
brain could see that two
consecutive lost checks in the mail and a story like the driver going to 
jail just sounds like more BS
than I have boots able to walk through.

If you would truly like to keep this person, dont reply to the whole list 
this time around, and neither
will I. As far as I see it, ive been put into quite possibly the worst 
position I could have right now with
the move and everything else I have to deal with, and someone willing to put 
another listmember into
such a position over what I cant help but to see as flakey behavoir - 
deserves to have their name pulled
through a bit of mud in the process. If nothing else, maybe as a warning to 
someone else reading this.

Maybe im not trustworthy enough, but I feel more like I was a sucker in this 
situation.
