Subject: Holy hydrocarbons! I failed dilution!
Message-ID: &lt;375EF55E.2491B42D_at_west_dot_net&gt;

Actually I also failed HC (with a reading of 2000)--but I may not be
getting proper spark in one of the cylinders.

For the sake of argument, let's say that I find no problem with cylinder
firing or compression, would improper valve adjustment give me an HC
reading so high?

About dilution--does this necessarily mean that I have an exhaust leak?
I'm running a 74 1800cc with smog pump &amp; new EGR filter. EGR valve seems
to be working OK. How does a person go about checking for an exhaust
leak? The only visible problem is a small hole in the bottom of one of
the heat exchangers...wouldn't that simply be letting hot air escape
&gt;from the heating system, rather than introducing fresh air into the
exhaust system?
