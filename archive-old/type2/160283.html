I liked the &quot;bugs&quot;.

Now for my movie review: boring!!! If you want to watch animated cars with eyes for windshields that's actually entertaining, watch the classic Tex Avery cartoon called &quot;One Cab's Family&quot;:

There's also a WWII bomber version called &quot;Little Johnny Jet&quot; that was done the following year and is equally good if not a rip off of their own previous work.
