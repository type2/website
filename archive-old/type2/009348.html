1976 Westy Standard Edition
Yellow

Interior in excellent condition. Front Seats, Rear Seat and top bed all
original yellow plaid. Poptop
in great conditon. The sink works great. Has an icebox
All interior is in excellent condition.

Body is in good shape. Has some rust under the rear bumper but it no
holes. It does'nt look that bad but could use a little attention. The
Engine is new with less than 10,000 miles. This is a great camper and
is ready to roll as is. I've asked $5500 and then $5000, now I must
sell this bus...I'm asking $4300 now. This is a great bus and runs
great and easily worth over $5000.
