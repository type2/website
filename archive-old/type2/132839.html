Subject: Rivi progress/JBB trip

General info: Working a job where you sit on your butt 17 hours/day is
detrimental to your health. 

Sitting for 17 hours then going out to work on a bus in the hot, muggy,
midnight air really sucks. I think I spent more time crawling out from
under the Rivi to stretch out the kinks than I did actually working on it. 

Thanks for the chamois suggestion a while back NQ. Great headband.

OK, two nights ago I got out there and got all of the fuel line run. Got
the fuel pump mounted. Got the regulator and &quot;T&quot; for the fuel line
positioned for mounting on the firewall. 

Tonight I'll try to get the &quot;T&quot; and regulator mounted, went and bought some
short self tapping screws for the firewall and hose clamps to use as
mounting devices. I'll also see about putting the muffler on but I need to
run home for a shower since ours here at work is down during some minor
remodeling - that's 2 hours worth of driving for a shower &lt;sigh&gt;. 

I've already decided that my cojones are too small to try and get it
running for JBB. I'm towing again. Starting it this week and driving 2800
miles next week gives me the willies all of a sudden. I'm not thrilled
about the amount of mountain driving I'll have to do going northeast but...
oh well. 

Maybe I can talk Jake into coming up and he can be there for the engine
startup. Should be down to the point of just wiring it up by the time I
leave for JBB. Plus the little things have come up that make me a bit more
uncomfortable -- like where the heck do I get vaccuum for the booster? I
think I need a 3/4 valve cover with a nipple on it since I have the dual
Webers installed. And, where do I run my breather hose to? 

Further, short, report in the next few days to note progress.

Gerald
