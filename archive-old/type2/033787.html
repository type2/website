&gt; You are right, I've only seen 7 buses around the DC area at the most.


also in suburban Maryland (Takoma Park): my '79 Westy, white with a green stripe all around (used to be Kansas Beige) and a friend's green and white '76 bus and another friend's green '78 Westy. All within one block of each other...

Cheers,
Marcus
