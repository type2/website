Subject: Re: Tranny Oil 80W-90 Ok ?

The correct fluid for our transmissions is 80W90 with a GL-4 specification.
GL-5 is the newer version but has EP(extreme pressure) properties that make 
it &quot;too slick&quot; and may also be harmful to some of the metals inside the 
transmission.
It is incorrect for our transmissions.

I was just at Pep Boys, and they carry a GL-4 80W90 gear oil.  Forget the 
brand off the top of my head.  $2.99 a quart or they sell it by the gallon.

You will need approx 2.5 qts.   Don't forget; pull the add plug first, before 
draining.
