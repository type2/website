&gt; Normally I'd agree with you about surveys, but this thread has been very
&gt; interesting to me.  It has given me a better feeling and understanding for
&gt; who is on the otherside of the ether on our fabulous list.  It hasn't put
&gt; faces on the names but it has given me a better understanding of our follow
&gt; Bus brethren ( and sisters).

Ditto for me.  I initially sent the following personally to the survey
originator, but decided to post to the list as I got so much enjoyment
out of reading other people's posts...

Me, I'm a teacher at a small private school for inner city kids in
Houston, TX.  As such, I get relatively no income.  But I also get
summers off.  I'm lucky that I don't have to drive every day, since I
live on the campus.  When I'm working I teach art, computers, and
writing, and I also keep the campus computers running (most of the
time).  Honestly, I like to work more on my twenty six year old bus than
I do on some of these brand new computers... :)

I'm also lucky in that my bus (mine as of last month) is a '73 Camper in
decent condition.  Needs some body work and a good paint job, but runs
well.  

Can I afford it?  Hmmm...  just hope that the bank decides to renew my
credit card this month... :)
