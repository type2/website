Subject: [T2] (long) Beautiful blue Bus stopped dead

Howdy all!

Be warned, this is a long one.  I’m going crazy but
not foaming at the mouth yet.  I’ll make it as short
as I can manage :)

I originally got my beautiful blue Bus to learn about
automobiles and cause it was just so darn fun to
drive!  Now I’m moving from Boston to Seattle via DC,
Charleston SC, Atlanta GA, Memphis TN and Las Vegas
NM.  Since I started in Boston I’ve had problems with
Bus “kicking” when a significant load was placed on
it.  Sadly, last night the problem became so severe I
had to limp it to a town that could tow it to my
buddy’s place in Memphis.

My Bus:
73 Transporter
Type IV pancake engine
Weber Progressive Carburetor (36DFAV)
009 Distributer (it’s a mechanical advance, no vacuum)
No emissions controls (shame shame on me)

To try to keep this tale concise, here’s the gist:
I’ve been traveling a lot in the past 4 months,
driving around the eastern side of the US.  I’ve been
paying careful attention to oil changes, point gap,
timing, valves.
	
It seems that the problems started after I left
Boston, about 1000-1500 miles ago.  It started as a
faint jerking under load, but has eventually evolved
into violent kicking, most noticeably under load. 
Some 600 or so miles ago it also started faintly
backfiring and it too has gotten more noticeable and
severe.  Turning on the lights makes the problem
worse.  I’m not positive, but I think water might make
things worse as well.  It idles OK.  This problem used
to only surface under load, but now I can replicate it
by yanking on the accelerator cable while out of gear.

All this time I’ve been trying to work on the engine
to locate the source of the problem, since curses,
prayers and burnt offerings haven’t worked.  Here’s
what I’ve done so far:

I took out the Carburetor and cleaned it out the best
I could.  I didn’t have a rebuild kit or a soak tank. 
I took it apart carefully, cleaning it with my little
bottle of solvent ( I believe its called Marine Clean,
the stuff the POR15 sells).  There were particulates
in the float tank.  I strongly suspect rust in the gas
tank, so I replaced the fuel filter and prayed that I
could make it to Seattle before having to
clean/replace it.

Also related to the carburetor, the boots connecting
the carb to the intake manifold were old and worn.  At
least one of them had a hole.  I couldn’t find any new
ones off hand so I used electrical tape to seal them
up the best I could (tape just around the boot, not
attaching the boot to the carb/intake manifold, I’m
still using the clamps for that) .  I think they
should be replaced ASAP, but I’m hoping the tape will
hold out until I have that chance.  I think that the
boots are the style of boots used on the dual carb
setup.  If so, are these boots wrong?  They seem to
fit OK.

Redone the points and timing several times. 
Eventually I tried replacing the points.  All to no
avail.  (I’ll replace the condenser when I can get my
hands on one).

Redone the valves several times.

Checked the compression.  I don’t have the numbers but
#4 is weakest coming in just a hair over 100, and the
rest are from about 105-115.

Replaced the spark plugs.  After about 700 miles I’ve
checked the spark plugs again and they are a nasty
black.  Something to note: usually I use Bosch spark
plugs, but nobody North Carolina or Virginia (that I
checked with, anyway) stocks those.  The ones they
gave me as a replacement (Autolights, I believe) had a
shorter thread-base than the Bosches.  The dude was
positive the change in size would only give me less
power but otherwise wouldn’t hurt.  (Any opinions?)

Unhooked the alternator belt and drove around a vacant
parking lot.  My thought was that if the problem was
the alternator, removing it would remove the problem. 
Nothing changed (aside from the battery light lighting
up), so I put it back on.

Unhooked the regulator (the 2.5” by 2.5” little box at
the front right of the engine compartment).  Nothing
changed (except the light), so I hooked it back up.

There was some carbon buildup in the distributor cap,
so I used my handy knife to shave it off the rotor
(the spinny top contact as well as the one at the end
of the arm) and the “arms” that the spark jumps to.  I
wiped things off as good as I could.  There was no
“line of carbon” that I’ve heard warnings about.

Verbally begged, coaxed, promised, prayed, cursed,
yelled, whispered, praised, demeaned and anything else
I thought Bus would respond to.

Known issues:
As I said, I’m pretty sure I have rust in the gas
tank, and am hoping that the filter will be enough for
2500 more miles.

I think I have an exhaust leak.  I’ve not gone looking
for it, but am considering it because I’m running out
of options.

My theory:
I didn’t do a very through job of cleaning the
carburetor, so maybe it is still having problems. 
Turning on the lights makes the problems worse because
a greater load will be exacted on the engine, thus
making it harder to run, making the problem more
severe.  Could an exhaust leak be a problem too? 
Bently suggests carburetor problems in its
troubleshooting section.

Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.  I’m
primarily interested in solutions that will give me
the 2500 miles left, but I’d also love to hear “ideal”
solutions too (or any other type of advice, like
“don’t do that!” or “go do some more research :)  

As an extra complication,  I’m trying to get there on
or before the 23rd.  I’ll have to find some way to
ship it or move it up there if I cannot get it
operational.

Thanks for bearing with me, y’all have a great one!
Dano!
