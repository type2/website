Hi Eric &amp; Barb (&amp; the rest of the Type2 community),

Was it you that was suggesting that you would like to find a circuit for
a O2 mixture sensor? I'm referring to an exchange a while back where we
were talking about gauges for the VWs. 

I found the URL I had gotten off the list for a circuit using LED
readout for a standard O2 sensor. The circuit is at: 
http://www.pelicanparts_dot_com/techarticles/mult_air_fuel_monitor/mult_air_fuel_monitor.htm

I think this is a site Thom had posted a while ago, but I was having
trouble finding it in the archives. I came across printouts (don't call
the copyright cops!) from one of their pages with the URL. It's a
Porsche site with some great tech &amp; show articles.

Hope this is useful, sorry if this is &quot;unsolicited&quot; and you weren't the
ones looking for this info. I'm posting to the list in case others were
looking for the same thing. I hope there hasn't been a recent thread on
this... I've only had time to skim digests recently!
