Subject: Re: [T2] Bay windshield installation

Hi John,

I put the seal on the glass first. It makes the glass easier/safer to 
handle.

Happy trails,

&gt; When installing a windshield into a bus, is it best to first attach 
&gt; the rubber seal to the glass, THEN put the whole thing onto the bus

&gt; body of the bus THEN use the string method to place the glass into the 
&gt; seal? I have read about it both ways.
