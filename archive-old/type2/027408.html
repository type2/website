No, mine are doing fine.  Recently had the honor of assisting a fellow buser 
with a brake job.  He was having problems stopping and his e-brake wasn't 
working a-tall.  After procuring the correct cables and the the wrong brake 
shoes from an establishment that posts often to the lists we proceeded with 
the operation.  We removed the brake drume, associated hardware and 
unidentifiable bits.  I learned a long time ago the hard way to disassemble 
only 1 side at a time so we felt better about the unidentifiable bits.  We 
noticed the left side shoe attached to the e-brake cable showed definite 
signs of having been hung up, as there was almost no material left on the 
lining.  We detached the fronts of the cables.  Started pulling them back, 
and the cable quit coming before the forward end cleared the end of the 
tube.  Hmmm.  Bowing down before the gods of infernal combustion, we peered 
at the tubes.  What we saw was not a pretty sight.

Some bonehead (I'm being nice here) had jacked the bus up using the e-brake 
cable tube to protect the paint on their floor jack.

We worked long and hard to reshape the tubes to something that resembled not 
a tortilla on the grill rather a slightly misshapen sausage viewed from the 
end.  Ran cables, went out and got the right brake shoes locally, finished 
the job.  Bleed and adjust (repeated the next day) and we were off.

The point I'm making is that if you're having e-brake troubles, you might 
want to check the cable runs for damage.  The solution may be as simple as 
re-forming the cable runs into something that resembles round.

Another important safety tip from Mad Uncle &quot;don't use gas to light fires&quot;
