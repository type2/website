&gt; No, handbrake isn't on.
&gt; Re penitrating oil, I did apply Liquid Wrench at the lug studs to ease
&gt; possible rust binding of drums to hubs. Also carefully applied to adjuster
&gt; threads. No go yet, but fortunately time is on my side, this is not my only
&gt; car.
&gt; Will continue to oil and bang.
&gt; Other suggestions????

More time, repeated applications of Liquid Wrench, PB Blaster, or Kroil,
some tapping with a small ball-peen hammer (don't get carried away, a
little vibration is what you need).

Heat is also good, applied to the drum around the center hub hole inside
the wheel studs.  Do not heat the hub itself, though, as you want that
part to stay unexpanded.  Wear gloves and see if you can get any motion
while hot.  If not, back to the penetrating oil.

Eventually you will get a little bit of motion, then you can wiggle,
wiggle, wiggle until things come apart.

Before reassembling, use fine sandpaper to clean all mating surfaces of
rust.  Make sure that the parts slide together and apart easily.  Coat all
of these surfaces with a very thin layer of anti-sieze to keep things from
rusting together again.
