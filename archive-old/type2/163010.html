Subject: Re: [T2] Looks like its a Southwind, not a BA-4 or 6

&gt;I guess all I need to do is figure out how to adjust the fuel/air mixture
&gt;now.

You can't adjust the mixture on a Southwind, it is set by the RPM of 
the combustion blower motor.  The best thing you can do is rebuild 
the heater.  Southwinds put out a lot of heat for their size, but 
they need to be running correctly.  Of course keeping a gas heater 
tuned up is a good safety measure anyway, the old fuel lines need to 
be replaced just like on the engine.
