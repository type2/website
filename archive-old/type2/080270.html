Subject: [T2] Synthetic Oil

Hello everyone,

       After reading most of the responses I felt I needed to comment on =
this issue.  My daily driver is a 1996 Audi A4 2.8 quattro.  I've been =
using synthetic in it since I bought the car used in 2000, when I =
changed the oil for the first time at about 10,000 miles I was =
absolutely shocked.  Thier was no sludge.  The oil was black, yes but =
cleaner than I expected and sludge free, impressive.  My car runs fine =
with the synthetic.  As for leaks, just about all 2.8 VR6 VW or 2.8 Audi =
engines seem to leak oil.  Mine is no different.  It was leaking before =
I switched to synthetic and it leaked afterward.  Audi recommends a =
regular change interval of 7500 miles with regular oil.  Oil companies =
insist that it you change at 3000 when the detergents in the oil begin =
to break down. I used to split the difference and change at 5000.   Let =
me just say that my bus is going to get an oil change, probably the =
first on in years, and get Mobil 1 15W-50.  Why?  Its the best oil I can =
buy, and I only needed 4 quarts.    Synthetic lasts longer because it =
inherently has fewer inpurities in it, it takes much longer for the oil =
to break down into sludge and gunk.  Does my bus really need synthetic? =
No, I don't think its going to matter what oil I put in it, provided I =
change it regularly.  Anyway if synthetic oil is not compatible with =
air-cooled engines then why has Porsche been using it for all these =
years?  I'm interested in hearing an answer on this one. =20
