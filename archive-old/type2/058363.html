Hello All,
I've had 2 different Weber 32/36 Carbs on my 1700 CC Type 4 1972 Bus. I am
not happy with the smoothness or reliability of any one of them. Can I
purchase an adaptor plate (or entire manifold) to fit on my manifold to
install a Solex 34 PICT 3 carb, or another single barrel carb. I remember
how smooth these things have been on my Type 1 engines, and can see no
reason why I shouldn't be able to run it on a 1700 CC type 4, especially
when I know people why use them on their 1776's. 


Thanks for everything!

-John Tracy
