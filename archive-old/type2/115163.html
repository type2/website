Subject: Re: [T2] Help! 68 Brake lights

Matt,

My best guesses.


1. If blinkers work, rear brake wires and lamps are OK since they are one 
and the same. Also part of the the flasher function is working.

2.  It seems the output from the emergency flasher relay (J) pin 54S is is 
not active or the wire (black red/stripe) that connects it to the turn 
signal switch(G)pin 54S is open. The green brake light wire runs in the 
emergency flasher relay (J) on  pin 54 and out pin 54s to the turn signal 
switch (G)pin 54s.


3. The ignition needs to be on for the brake lights to work.

4. Inop horn most likely another prob.

&gt;Volks,
&gt;
&gt;I have a 1968 Camper. I am unable to get the brake lights to work. Fuses 
&gt;are
&gt;all good. Press the brake warning light and it lights up. Running lights
&gt;work. Blinkers work. Emergency blinkers do not work. Horn does not work. My
&gt;owners manual indicates that the first fuse powers the brake lights,
&gt;blinkers, horn and I'm assuming emergency lights. In following the wiring 
&gt;on
&gt;a chart indicates that the inside grey wires on the rear tail lights
&gt;(running off of the 7th and eighth fuses) are running and blinker and the
&gt;outside black/yellow, black/red are brake lights (running off of fuse 1).
&gt;
&gt;Does the ignition and/or the engine need to be on for the brake lights to 
&gt;work?
&gt;Can anyone shed some light on this. I don't know where to go at this point.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;Matt
