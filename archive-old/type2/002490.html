Hello all,

I have a 71 bus with a 1600 DP engine. Upon acceleration and when I lift my
foot off the pedal, there is a rough, throaty feel to the engine. As I wind
out the gears, this goes away. It idles fine. When the bus is in neutral and
I'm pressing and releasing the pedal, I also notice it. This happened to me
another time after a couple days of rain but would stop after I drove for a
while.

Is this a misfire? A carb problem? Something else? Any help would be greatly
appreciated.
