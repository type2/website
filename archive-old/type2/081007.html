Subject: Re: Camper Water Tank

&gt;Does anyone know what's good for cleaning the inside of the plastic camper
water tank under the sink so it's drinkable again?&lt;

&gt;&gt;try bleach (diluted, of course!).  that's probably what your favorite
brewery uses to sanitize all of their equipment.

When cleaning/sanitizing my homebrew equipment and the bottles I fill with
the soon-to-be beer, I use a bleach-to-water ratio of approximately 2 oz.
bleach per 5 gallons water.  This works well and has never failed to render
everything sufficiently clean and drinkable.  I use the same the basic ratio
(adjusted for tank size) of bleach and water when I clean the water tank in
my bus, with the same results.  I usually fill the tank with this
bleachwater concoction and then drive around the block a few times to slosh
&amp; spread it around in there.  Then, just as when I clean beer bottles, I
always drain and then rinse with warm water several times until I can no
longer detect the smell of bleach.  The tank always sparkles after this.
