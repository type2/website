&gt; Brand new Type 1 engine in a 71 Bus, about 350 miles.  I built it myself,

did you set the end play????   sounds familiar to when I did that
incorrectly on my first rebuild.

&gt; and I still figured it was a bad connection, so I kept driving the last 5
&gt; miles home.  Yesterday, I went to start my bus, and the engine barely wanted
&gt; to turn over.  It sounded like it was really straining to turn, but it
&gt; finally started up, and ran for about 10 seconds, then died suddenly.  This
&gt; time it wouldn't even turn over, I could just hear the starter motor trying
&gt; to turn, but it couldn't.  I tried turning the motor by hand, using a wrench
&gt; on the pulley bolt, but it's definitely seized.  
&gt; 
&gt; So, I screwed up by driving that last 5 miles with no oil pressure, and

maybe, but as likely as not the low oil presure was a result of what ever
failed

&gt; maybe I'll be able to sit down by the end of the week, after all the kicking
&gt; myself in the butt stops.  The big question is, do I now own a $2000 paper
&gt; weight shaped like a VW engine, or can I save this thing?  I've never had a
&gt; seized engine of any kind, so I have no idea what to do, or what to expect

you will not know until you look

&gt; to see when I open the case.  I'd really appreciate the help of my fellow

it will probably be obvious, when the engine siezes it is big time problem
and it usually will jump out and hit you in the head when you find it.

&gt; listees on this one, since this has put me at the crossroads of VW Bus
&gt; ownership.  My wife has told me if this means buying a new engine, then the
&gt; Bus gets towed to the nearest junkyard.  Translated, this means I'll be

don't buy new engine, fix this one even if it means all new parts,
probably won't though I would bet on something reasonably repairable at
this stage.


&gt; scenario sucks.  Please advise, I'll listen to any and all tidbits of info,
&gt; advice, consolation, etc....

well,  BTDT, it sucks
