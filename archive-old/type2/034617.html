All,

If you want stickers....make them! It's pretty easy
and you can make a ton of them for about $2.00 total
cost, using your computer's printer.

First of all, make sure your printer's ink is
water-proof (Epson users are out of luck;-(), by
licking your finger and rubbing across something
printed on paper. No smudge? Good, read on.

Call a local screen-print supply house, or even a
screen-printer and ask if you can buy a sheet of
adhesive-backed vinyl (it comes in several colors, but
I suggest white, or *maybe* clear&lt;printing in color
will only work with white&gt;). Tell them it's for a
bumper-sticker...otherwise, it may not hold up to the
elements. If you have a choice in brands, go for 3-M,
it's the best. This shouldn't cost more than a few
bucks for a *very* large sheet (some are
24&quot;x30&quot;....plenty for stickers).

Then, cut a piece down to fit in your printer (8.5x11
is plenty big). Now, pay attention, this part is
*very* important if you want to ever use your printer
again...fold a piece of scotch tape over the leading
edge (the edge that will go in the printer first) of
the vinyl. Otherwise, the vinyl can seperate from the
backing and wrap around the spindles of the printer,
and that's a bad thing!

Now....print! Be sure you get Ken's permision if you
want to use his Type II logo!

After printing, simply cut out your snazzy little
sticker and &quot;stick it&quot; ;-)

I have done this *many* times, and they last for years
and look professional, as well. I found out the hard
way that alcohol will remove the ink, but you can
always print extras for this reason.


Have fun!
