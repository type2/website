Kyle,
	To add to what richard has said. YOu can (just for testing) block a
lot of the ports for your engine. Go to your local home improvement
store &amp; buy a lot of rubber stoppers (you know the ones like in
physics lab). disconnect the brake booster &amp; any other large hoses
going to the intake manifold. plug these. Then plug any of the hoses
leading from the &quot;s&quot; tube from the AFM. See what it does. Please don't
drive anywhere though, you won't have a brake booster &amp; I'm not sure
how well the fi will run w/out everything connected, but at least you
can simply hook one thing at a time back up &amp; see if it starts to run
very bad. I would also invest in a vacuum gauge to verify this. good
luck.
