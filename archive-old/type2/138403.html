Subject: Shock bushings available?

In a front end inspection, I noticed that the lower shock bushing on 
one side is shot.  The shocks seem to be German Boge's and damp really 
well, so I don't need to change them.  Does anyone know of a source for 
bushings alone?  Is this feasible, or are the bushings pressed in &quot;for 
life?&quot;  Hopefully this explains the unhappy noise over sharp bumps 
p-side.

thanks,
joe broach
