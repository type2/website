Subject: heat pumps? was Re: [T2] Latest heaters for Westy use?

&gt; So the latest rage I had read about was 

Recently I've been considering adding a heat pump to my house's natural 
gas furnace heating system.

Are there vehicle heating systems that use heat pump technology?

...the electrical drain when your vehicle is running might be okay 
though I'm uncertain about where to position the core...(engine bay? to 
collect excess engine heat?)

...when stopped you'd be entirely dependent on batteries but you'd be 
running a compressor and not heating elements so it might last longer.

...folks do use window A/C units but those get plugged in externally, 
don't they?
