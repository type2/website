&gt; My under the car por15 outfit:
&gt; 
&gt; coveralls
&gt; 
&gt; rubber gloves that are for chemical work.  they are
&gt; thick and go up to
&gt; past your forearms... keep you from getting a gap
&gt; between your glove and
&gt; coveralls. 

Another cool trick is to use duct-tape and wrap it
around your arm where the glove and coverall sleeve
meet. This works quite well and nothing gets through.

&gt;(i think i spent $2 on a pair from home
&gt; depot, have used em 6-8
&gt; times, and they are still in good condition. 
&gt; Dishwashing gloves are
&gt; pretty much the smae thing, but are usually pink,
&gt; heh)

No, dishwashing gloves are not the same...not at all.
Dishwashing gloves are made of latex and not immune to
any chemicals other than what is put it common dish
detergent. Sure, they'll keep your hands clean (from
the paint itself), but any and all solvents will pass
through and be absorbed into your skin! 

If you doubt me, try a pair on and use a little
lacquer-thinner/toluene/zylene/whatever on them...then
pull them off and smell your fingers. You'll smell
traces of whatever solvent you used, I promise.

True chem-proof gloves are made of neoprene or other
materials and they say &quot;chemical-proof&quot; (or something
to that effect)on them. This is an OSHA
requirement...so if it doesn't say it; don't trust it.


I learned this the hard way... I washed some
silk-screen frames with lacquer-thinner, using common
dish-gloves, and wearing a respirator (with the proper
filters &lt;don't even get me started on *that* one!&gt;). 

It took me about an hour to get the job done and I was
dizzy, nautious and short of breath for a couple of
hours therafter. This was a direct result of chemicals
being *absorbed* through the gloves and into my skin
(when it absorbs into your skin, it goes straight into
your blood veins and from there into your lungs,
brain, etc).


&gt; 
&gt; Spraying sock.  This you can get at good auto body
&gt; stores.  It covers your
&gt; head like a ski mask but has a big enough face
&gt; opening to allow a
&gt; respirator in.  its also thin enough not to overheat
&gt; you.

You can also get these at any home-paint store for
about $1.50 ea. Probably even Home Depot, but you
might have to ask for them.
