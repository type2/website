Subject: What in the world is this engine?

I posted this before and never really got an answer, I have dug a little
deeper and am still very confused....

My '77 Westy has an odd engine situation. The engine code (behind the oil
breather chimney) says V 0010992. I can't figure out what this beast is. There
is no VW stamp there either. Here are some other odd things...The port for the
oil filler tube has been blocked off with a piece of sheet metal. There is a
tube directly above this port for the dipstick booty. The booty does fit from
the fan shroud (which does have a 2 litre stamp on it). But there is no way to
fill the oil up other than removing the darn oil breather all the time. I
removed one of the (late model) heat exchangers and the rear hanger bar. I was
going to see if I could work the oil filler tube back in, however the oil
filler tube flange is kind of on a skew and the port in my engine is
horizontal. This engine has square port exhausts in the heads. I really only
wanted to fit the oil filler tube back in and stop an oil leak where the port
is blocked off. I reckon that is not possible, so I thought at the least I
could maybe I could figure out the origin of this engine. Anyone have any
ideas?

PS there is no place for a dipstick on top of the engine as found in the 411
or Porche engine.

Thanks,
