Thanks. Forgot to mention its a 1970, so upright. Doh. Compression cold was
130 all around, right after valave adjustment (hence cold engine).

Jeff,

If yu check the compressio of a cold engine, it will be slightly lower
than that of a hot one.  The rings expand with temperature and seal
better.  While it is good practice to check the compressions on the engine
with it warm, you can certainly make a gross estimate of engien condition
from cold readings.  A dropped valve is a dropped valve... the compression
will not magically rise at operating temp.  the danger of taking the
reading while the engien is cold is that you might miss a tight valve
adjustment.  there may be some clearance when the engine is cold, but teh
valve would be propped open when hot.

On the exhaust, the rotted cover makes very little difference to engine
temp.  It may be a tad hotter, since the heat from the pipe is not
directed away from the cylinders, but not a whole lot hotter.  Depending
on engine type, you can get J-tubes or not, as you wish.  On a T1
(bug/upright) engine, J-tubes may bring the engine temp down a hair.  If
you have a T4 engine, tho... there are no J-tubes made to fit these
engines.
