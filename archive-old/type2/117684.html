Subject: RE: [T2] Exhaust Stud Replacement (fwd)

Let me try this again, this time with feeling 

Early ones are 8x8 48mm (1.7,1.8)
late ones are 8x9 48mm  (2.0)
There may be some 2.0L with the 8X8 but I don't know that.

&gt; &gt; The stock studs were 8mm on one end and 9mm on the business end. They were
&gt; &gt; perhaps 102mm or 108mm long, but this is from memory,
&gt; &gt; I can't remember.
