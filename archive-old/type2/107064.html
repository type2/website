Subject: Camping interior needs to go

Is anyone interested in most of the interior to a 72 westfalia?  I am moving back to NC from CO and it needs to go to a new home and I do not want to trash it and I am not taking it back...sink, linen closet and the shelf thing that goes over the bed.  Take it all.  I am in Denver, so if anyone wants it, let me know.  As they say, 'they aint makin' no more of this stuff', so if someone wants it for themself or for posterity, let me know.... thanks
