Subject: Heater Cable Replacement
Content-Disposition: inline

Greetings,

I need to replace the heater cables on my '79 Westy.  I have the new cables (thanks Bus Depot) and have read the article in the Type2_dot_com Library.  Here's the problem, the article suggests tying a strng to the old cable and pulling it through to the front then use the string to pull the new cable through to the back.  I had to cut my old cables and have nothing to tie the string to.  Has anyone ever done this by simply pulling the old cable out and feeding a new cable in from the front without the aid of the string to pull it back?

Please reply to the list or to rweisel_at_uswest_dot_net as I'm writing this from work and will be leaving shortly.  TGIF!!!
