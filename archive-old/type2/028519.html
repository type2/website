The Bentley manual calls for straight 40wt at consistent ambient
temperatures above 68 degrees F. and 30wt from 32-76 degrees.  Those are old
specs and after many years of never using anything but straight weights, I
feel comfy with a quality 10w 40 here in the NW, unless I'm going to some
desert or Eastern WA in hot weather.  My gauges show little if any
difference in using 30wt vs 10w 40 once the engine is warmed up. If you have
adequate filtering, the synthetics are nice, but without full-flow filtering
you may not feel it's very cost effective.

Additional additives are not necessary in a properly built and
well-maintained engine...just snake oil IMHO.  I remember reading a GM
automotive engineering design textbook years ago that, without additives,
claimed immeasurable engine wear at 180-230 F oil temp under moderate load.
Keep her tuned and warm your baby up a few minutes...that'll do more good in
the long run.  Just think of those pistons moving up and down 50X a second
at 3000 RPM with cold oil...easy does it ;-)
