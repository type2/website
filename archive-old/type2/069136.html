Subject: re: Load Ratings [Autobooks Ltd.]

I got all energetic about providing answers to the Load Ratings query and
pulled my copy of &quot;Volkswagen Transporter 1954-67 Autobook&quot; off the shelf.

Then I read the copyright notice and decided that I really *would* try to
get permission.  After an hour of Web-searching I've found nothing about
the publisher other than a single reference of a reference from a Land
Rover manual published by the same company.

Can someone tell me if this company still exists and what the copyright
implications are if they don't.

Here are the details:

The book is hard-bound, about 7&quot;x10&quot;x1/2&quot;.
The illustrations are mostly from VW itself.
I would expect that the Bentley manual that goes the farthest back for
Type IIs would have all of this info plus more.

Still - it would be nice to be able to put the information in here out
there for all to share (especially the English version of the measurements
and capacities).

P.S.  After I started entering this message, I discovered that the load
      ratings aren't in this book anyway...
