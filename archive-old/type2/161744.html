Subject: RE: [T2] starter problem?

&gt;When I got back home, she sat for a while and I  jumped in to run to the
store. No start.  Nada

Sometimes the starter gets stuck on the flywheel and will act like this. Next
time put it in 3rd and push back rocking the bus to see if that makes it start
right up. Or the solenoid might be sticking.

&gt; I  think I could hear the starter click .
If you hear it click that means the solenoid is clicking and working properly.
Check connections to the battery too, sometimes they start to foul up and do
stuff like this.

&gt;Then I'll hit it with a  hammer.
Never hit the starter, only the solenoid

&gt;Anything else I could be missing?
Was it still hot? Maybe the infamous hot start problem?
