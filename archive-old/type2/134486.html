Subject: Re: [T2] Winter

&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt;     Well  we had some real winter weather here on Long Island, NY
&gt; today with the high in the low 20s and a dusting of snow.  The weather
&gt; reminded me that it's time to post my original poem about winter and
&gt; VW buses.

Funny poem! However, I've been inspired by Mr. Dave Bolen to try to tweak my
heat system to get it to blow HOT air. Pie in the sky? We'll see.
I've already checked the seals along the whole system, and they seemed fine.
I did _not_ seal everything with hi temp gasket sealant, but I might now.
See, when I'm idling in the driveway before work, I can feel a slight push
of air from the vent. At the top of the RPMs, I feel almost nothing, though
the vents are eventually warm. My plan is to see if there is some blockage
somewhere along the line with poking and prodding with the vacuum cleaner
attachment.
Wish me luck!
