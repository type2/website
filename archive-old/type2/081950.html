Subject: Re: [T2] Tranny bushings, linkages, adjustments?

I don't think the list can help you with the length of your protrusion...
Just for comparison purposes (you know how men are always comparing...)
mine is roughly 12 mm from ball to tip. Hope that helps.

&gt;
&gt; Okay, so this tunnel is obviously why the rear shift rod cannot be pulled
so easily as the front. It all makes sense now.
&gt;
&gt; Didn't you (Karl?) mention modifying the new bushings to fit typical to
the older ones? My shifting has been terrible.
&gt;
&gt; One more question, please. The ball on the bottom of the shifter has a
little protrusion apparently to line it up/maintain alignment in the cup of
the front shift rod that it falls into.
&gt;
&gt; My protrusion seems too short.
&gt;
&gt; Did I just say that?
&gt;
&gt; How long should the protrusion be?
&gt;
&gt; Go easy on me.

&gt; &gt;The rear rod goes thru a &quot;tunnel&quot;(a pipe).  The 2 bellows are on each end
of the pipe and seal the tunnel from the elements while the rod goes in at
the front and out in the rear.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;This tunnel/pipe is what the bushings ride inside of to help keep the rod
centered in the tunnel.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Front and rear couple together in the front and then the rear goes
&gt; &gt;straight thru to the rear tranny coupler.
