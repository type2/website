Subject: Brake hoses changed

Volks -

My Bus had a clogged right-front brake hose, which was diagnosed with the help
of various friendly listmembers.  I ordered all four replacement hoses (this
time from Bus Boys) and installed them on Saturday.  This quickly turned into
an all-day project as learning-curve issues, incidentals, and unnecessary
steps reared their heads.  There was no time to proceed with the planned
replacement of the steering gearbox.

(learning-curve: how to bleed air out of brake lines, how to adjust brakes
properly)
(incidentals: stuck hose fittings, missing/deteriorated grommets)
(unnecessary: remove each wheel to replace the brake hose?  but it's not in
the way...  I included this time-consuming step for the first two wheels and,
as daylight started to run short, ignored it for the remaining two.)

Results:  Bus no longer pulls to the left when braking.  Learned how to bleed
and adjust brakes.  Reaffirmed my belief in the virtues of nitrile gloves.
Discovered that the right-rear brake drum will need machining whenever the
next brake job is due.

All of the brake lines, with the exception of the clogged one, seemed to be in
perfectly good condition (not worn or cracked or deteriorated in the least),
and I've saved the three good hoses for emergency spares.  Given the good
condition of the other hoses, I should have invoked the if-it-ain't-broke rule
and replaced only the clogged one, allowing time to move on to the steering
box.  It might be weeks before I have another day and another borrowed
driveway.  Live and learn, I suppose...

Cheers &amp; thanks to all who helped to diagnose the problem,

- Miles
