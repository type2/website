&gt;I'm in the middle of an overhaul to my VW vanagon 80. A VW parts

&gt;Has anyone done this before? What is your experience? Is this
&gt;recommended for an air cooled motor? What are the implications?

There are some contradictions here - first of all, an 80 Vanagon should
have a 2000cc, or possibly a 1600 outside the US?  Not sure, but I've never
heard of an 1800 in an '80 model.  So...

Scenario 1 - you actually have a 2000.  In this case you have 94mm pistons
and going to 96mm will give you about 2100cc's.

Scenario 2 - you really do have an 1800 in there with 93mm pistons.  In
this case, going to 96mm will push you up to 1900cc, not 2200.  You would
have to combine the larger cylinders with a stroker crankshaft to get that
kind of displacement.
