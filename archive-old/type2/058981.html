Thanks everyone for all the advice!!!  I will have time to test your
theories this weekend ... will keep you up to date.  BTW this bus has an
auto tranny and a guy at work thinks it is possible that ATF got sucked into
the motor through a vacum hose????  He is not a VW guy, but says this
happens on chevys a lot???  I was very low on tranny fluid and had to add
better than a pint when all of this happened ... it was checked when I left
and I don't know of any BIG leaks.  Does this change anything???  Sorry to
be a pest, but the books are really good for proceedures, but short on
diagnostics.

Mike
