Subject: bosch points design flaw?

Recently there's been a design change in Bosch ignition points.  
The little pad that makes contact with the distributor cam used 
to be made of a fiber material.  Now, it's made of a white 
plastic.

A week ago this plastic piece broke off while I was driving, 
closing the points and immediately shutting down the engine.  
This was on a freeway.  I stupidly didn't have another set in 
the car (had several at home that I had temporarily removed from 
the car during a cleaning/inventory and hadn't yet put back).  
Luckily, a stranger stopped and gave me a lift to an auto parts 
store several miles away and then brought me back to my car.  I 
got a cheap off-brand set of points, which actually may be more 
reliable because the pad looks more stable (the rest of the set 
looks pretty cheapie, though, and the wire to the condensor is a 
stretch).

I never had this part break in nearly 20 years of owning air 
cooled VW's (always with Bosch ignition parts).

Has anyone else seen this problem or have any comments?

I don't subscribe to the Vintage VW list right now, but anyone 
is welcome to forward this to them if you want.  (These problems 
happened to have been in a beetle with &quot;013&quot; points, but the 
&quot;009&quot; points on my bus have had the same change recently, so 
I'd think they're also in danger.)
