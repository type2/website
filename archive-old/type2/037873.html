(I meant to send this to everyone.)

Why d'ya think they call it an Adventurewagen?!

It was running on 3-1/2 cylinders -- it dropped a lock nut off the stud
on the #4 intake valve. Man, what a racket! Popped it back on this
morning, adjusted everything to spec, it's beautiful, and just got to
work (after delivering Brian McCormick's boom box that he left behind at
the Cabrillo BBQ).

I'm planning to get one of those Unisyns so I can figure out this dual
carb thang (anyway).

Now I have to figure out why both of my batteries drained -- the coil is
supposed to isolate the auxiliary when the bus is off. Time for a new
battery, at least.

Thanks for all the help and input! Steve and Don and David and Lee and
George.... and my smart-ass roommate who &quot;didn't want to run up my cell
phone bill too much because I'd be spending serious money on my bus
soon.&quot; Nyah, nyah, nyah.

&gt; Nikki Elmo is having bus problems in Julian, CA.  If you can lend a hand,
&gt; please call Steve Dolan at 703-684-7689.  Nikki'sw bus is running on 2
&gt; cylinders and, since it's a dual-carb bus, carb problems are suspected.
