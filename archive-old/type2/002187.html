Hello. I threw everything out in the garbage because it had gone pretty bad.
The icebox was gone and the cabinet was wobbly and crappy. The rear seat was
really dirty and gross. The foam bed mat was gruesome!! We're talking
panelling with the colour peeling off of it, and water damaged panelling. I
still have the sink  and water tank cabinet in the van because it's still
good. I like the water system, i put a new faucet on the sink. The bed was
just some pieces of plywood held together with piano hinges, hung from seat
belts! It was junk, believe me, or I would have kept it. Westy stuff is so
much better. It can be gotten, much more worthwhile. Tom
