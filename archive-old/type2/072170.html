Subject: wanna gas tank?

hi all - i have a gas tank originally intended for my 68. a better one came
along my way, so i used it instead. then another better one came my way,
which makes this spare expendable. it is great on the outside, and has a
superficial bit of rust on the inside top. great as is, or a coating
wouldn't be bad...just not real necessary. i rate it a 9.25. who can pick
it up between now and soon in eugene, oregon?    - steve
