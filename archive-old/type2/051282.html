Subject: Re: [T2] Pulling a trailer behind a bus

I would look for a low profile roof that is the same height or shorter than
your roofline.  Also, a two wheel axle is all you will need.  As far as
construction material?  Wood is cheaper than sheet metal which is cheaper
than Aluminum.  Some people build trailers from kits.  I've seen a guy
pulling a half bug behind his TRIKE.  Coolest VW trailer I've ever seen.  If
you are feeling creative make one!!

As far a hitches go, I use a 2&quot; ball on my factory hitch.  Maybe U-Haul or
the likes can install an aftermarket type receiver.  I haven't looked into
that, but I know they install them on just about everything.  Be careful as
you don't want some non VW mechanic to weld something that prevents you from
dropping the engine..

&gt; What should one look for in a trailer and hitch for a bus?
&gt;
&gt; I am an avid overpacker, and a trailer is just what I need!  Not too
&gt; large and as light as possible.  I'm looking in my local paper's online
&gt; classifieds, and not seeing any trailers...  Their indexing system
&gt; sucks.
