Subject: Quirky SW gas heater

OK, I got the wiring figured out on my 12 V SW gas
heater. I hooked it all up and it fired and got HOT
right away. However, as it continued to run, it did
not cycle correctly and eventually thr air started to
blow cool. Turn it off for 15 minutes, restart it, and
sam thing, gets HOT then peters out to blowing cool
air.
Any Ideas what my problem may be?
