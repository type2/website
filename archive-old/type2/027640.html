Hi Folks,
   Anybody want to go camping?  If so, here's your last reminder from me 
about Limbo On Long Island.  I promise I won't send this again next friday, 
because I'll be at the campground.

    June 8- 10 (Fri-Sun) Indian Island County Park, Riverhead, N.Y - The 1st 
annual &quot;LiMBO on Long Island&quot; Caravan through wine country. Raffles and 
prizes. Potluck dinner on Saturday night. Contact: Andrea and Brad Rasso at 
631-475-8620, e:mail at arasso_at_yahoo_dot_com or go to 
http://arasso.tripod_dot_com/limbo/ and click on the campinfo.jpg and 
campdirections.jpg files

   Hope to see you there!!!
