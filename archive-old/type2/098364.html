Subject: Re: [T2] friday on a saturday

Dave,

I love it!!!  The most interesting meta-analysis is:

Readers &quot;Always or Sometimes&quot; Perform Maintenance on Own Vehicle.......91.0%

TOOL OWNERSHIP (Purchased or Plan to Purchase in the Next 12 Months.)
Automotive Hand Tools.........................87.8%

which means to me that 3.2% of VWT readers are chewing the nuts off with
their teeth! (that or 3.2% of VWT readers count &quot;filling the gas tank&quot; as
maintainance :-)
