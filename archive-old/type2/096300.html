&gt; black book, CPI guide and an appraisal from a professional would have put
&gt; the value around $4500, however, blue book lists it at about $1500 so of
&gt; coarse they offered me $1200 for my car. when the repair bills are $2500,
&gt; they pretty much laughed at me. you should have seen their reaction when
&gt; i told them what the car was really worth. if i ever get my beetle fixed,

what few people know is that there is a &quot;green&quot; book that list actual
value for older and historic cars.   the difference is unreal.

the blue book for my van is $800 or so the green book value same van is
over $4,500 if I recall, the blue book is for trade ins and I think the
insurance companies love em too because it allows them to low ball you.

&gt; appropriately. i may want to do that with the bus. you would think that
&gt; if the vehicles are selling for a certain amount that the blue book would
&gt; reflect that... but it doesn't. 

no that is what the green book does, and they are written be the same
company I think....I found my copy in the city library reference section
