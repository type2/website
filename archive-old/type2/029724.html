Nicholas,

This is a pretty common solution to this problem, and nylocks ought to do
the trick of holding the levers on. *But* I woulda peened the bolt threads
over or used some high-strength lock-tite on them.  The reason for this
recommendation is...

I had one experience with a bus where a standard nut and bolt had been 
used to assemble the lever to the shoe.  That nut came off at highway
speed and there was *such* a huge clatter in the rear as that nut banged
around that I came very close to a laundry call :-)  I don't think it
would be dangerous, the nut is way too thick to wedge between the shoe and
drum, but it sure is loud!
