&gt;AS I began to tear out the reminents of my old foam type engine seal,

&gt;Do I need to install my new seal with an adhesive, or was this
&gt;just the result of an old seal mwlting to the engine?

I've seen seals applied with adhesive on the tin, but I don't see why this
would be necessary. I replaced the seal on my '74 last week and didn't use
any adhesive. It fits really snugly as is.
