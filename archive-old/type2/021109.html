Tommy...
    Go for it!  I drove one of the Safari models in Nigeria back around
1964.  NONE of the roads were 'roads' at that time.  I have a picture
somewhere of a 'road' (wheeltracks in the grass, really) with a small
TREE in the center!   The bus has plenty of clearance, and can take it
off road.  Just don't try to go as fast as those stunt drivers in the
Stupid Usless Vehicle commercials.  But DO get the skid-plates under the
front of engine/transmission areas before you do much wild country.  And
DO carry extra air filters, a good jack, some 4x4 lumber, and spare
tires!  We sometimes needed to clean the oil-filled air filters daily.
And don't worry too much about CG.....I've tipped one (on big rocks) far
enough to almost panic.

I'm looking to purchase a winch for my bus.  I guess it would have to be

electric or hand-powered, given that the engine is on the opposite end
(although I suppose I *could* mount it on the back) but I was wondering
about just that:  Where to mount it
