Subject: fiberglass top conditioner, wax, sealant???
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Just finished installing my new Adventurewagen top today...looks great except
for a few small hairline cracks &amp; such. The fiberglass felt pretty brittle &amp;
dry &amp; I was wondering if anyone out there knew of any readily available
conditioners or treatments that I could apply safely w/ out risk of
discoloration. Something that would soak in giving me a good protective (uv,
dirt, bird poo) seal, as well as make the fiberglass more flexible and longer
lived. Any experienced advice would be greatly appreciated!!!
p.s. the glass is very similar in texture to the Westy top...
