Subject: Re: Battery Light On!

It sounds like the brushes in your alternator might need to be replaced. I haven't had any 
problems with my VW vans alternaturs but I have on other cars. On my '84 Vanagon the 
brush/regulator asembly screw into the back of the alternator and are easy to check and or 
replace. I dun't know if your alternator would be setup the same. 

What you describe as a flicker of the battery light at higher RPMs is something I have 
witnessed when the alternator brushes were worn. Something to consider anyway..... If your 
alternator is not functioning and your battery is nearly dead I wouldn't push start it to go 
anywhere because the ignition and whatever other electrical drains will take whats left in the 
battery and leave you dead!

should have been under rear seat on a '77 but wasn't. hmmmm...

so what could it be. started up the westy today, battery light comes on bright
then flickers at a higher rpm but stays on. goes off when key is turned off.
alternator?

was planning on going to the mountains next weekend. i understand that the
cooling is not affected by the alternator operation in a type iv. is it still
safe to drive? if the battery is drained i could push start it right?

any info would be much appreciated.
