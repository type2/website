Former Army wife, presently working at discount store, MacFrugal's. Bought 
the first bus in Vicenza, Italy. Needed a transport vehicle for move to 
Germany.  It was originally from a dealer in Virginia.  Shipped it back to 
states, bought present '72 bus here in Colorado.  Fell in love, can't fall 
out.  Only vehicle I can stand driving for long periods without my back 
killing me.  The floor placement of the control pedals,vs firewall.  I live 
in Fountain, CO. Can't miss the Blunderbus, Triumph motorcycle stickers all 
over her. : )
