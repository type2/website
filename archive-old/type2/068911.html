First, try checking the voltage at that point with the distributor
wire disconnected.  If there's still no power (with the key on, of
course), then either a wire has broken, the ignition switch has died,
a fuse has blown, or your battery is dead.  If you get dash lights and
such when you turn the key to on, the battery and switch are good, so
start looking for wires that aren't.  If nothing happens when the
switch is turned, use a test light between the positive terminal of
the battery and ground to see if it has power.  If yes, it's probably
the switch or a connection between the battery and the switch.
Otherwise, it's probably the battery.

Batteries can die on their own, or because there's something shorting
to ground such that it pulls power all the time, even when the key is
off.  If it looks to be the battery, disconnect it, and clip a battery
charger in its place.  With the key off, it should claim there's no
power flowing (use one with a meter on it).  If it claims to be
providing power, it's time to figure out what.  Also, now that the
battery's been isolated for a bit, see if you can get anything out of
it.  They'll often recover a little charge if left completely
disconnected for a while.

I'm not sure of the common failure modes of the ignition switch.  I
just discovered mine's been fried: when in the `on' position, it
provides about eight volts to the starter.  This fried the starter
terminal on the switch, and produced all sorts of burning odors up
front.  I'm pretty sure the more common failure mode is similar to
what you're describing though -- power becomes flaky as contacts
erode, followed eventually by complete failure.

Depending on exact symptoms, we can talk you through more diagnosis.
This should be enough to get you started, though.
