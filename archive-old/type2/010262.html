&gt; If spraying WD-40 on like holy water doesn't work, 

Just wanna say that using WD-40 on anything but a stuck nut, bolt or screw is
a bad idea.  WD-40 and other 'penetrating oils' act as solvents eventually
dissolving all lubricants like oil or grease.  You end up with a joint or
device that was is dryer than it was when you started. We like oil and grease.
We want them to stick around.

If you  must use a spray lube on something that needs lubed, use silicon or
lithium grease in a can. Great stuff.  Sticks around.
