Subject: Re: [T2] Distributer timing

I am going through the same ordeal.  I just found  a funky wire broken in my 
distributor (this is still under investigation).  I also replaced my cold 
start valve, was yours burnt?  My next step is to adjust my valves, There's a 
possibilty of blow by if the valves aren't correct (so I'm told).  I also replaced 
my points, condenser, still same prob.  So, I'm pretty sure my prob. is the 
distributor. (I hope!!!)

                    Anyway good luck!!
