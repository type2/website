Subject: Re: vacuum leaks

You got my attention with the vacuum readings. I recently put a guage on my
81 as part of getting my idle and timing set etc. At the time I was looking
for any eratic needle movements indicating a valve problem since my idle is
not as smooth as I would like. The needle was rock steady but as I recall the
actual reading was 5 or 7 less than what the generic manual with the guage
indicated it should be. Since the needle was steady I didn't think anything
about it other than to guess that vw's might create less vacuum than V-8's.

Since I recently put on new Stephens heads, pistons and cylinders, I hope my
memory is correct and that I was reading 15 while the manual was touting 20
to 22. Yours is the first mention I've seen of what the vacuum psi ought to
be on a vw. Would it be correct that larger engines would have a higher
reading?

Thanks,

Weston
