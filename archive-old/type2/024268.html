Subject: FI - Won't idle After 5 min.
Message-ID: &lt;7inkrn$djva_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

This is in my '72 that has a '78 engine and '83 fuel injection.

I've searched can not find the answer.

The van starts up great when it is cold or even after it's been sitting for a few minutes.  But when it sits and idles for 5 minutes it sputters and dies or if I drive for a while and then stop it will sputter and die.  If I give it gas while it's sputtering it does nothing. I believe it run fine at highway speeds forever.

I've spent most of the day with this and have not any luck.  Any suggestions to help spend only half the day on this on Saturday

Thank you.
