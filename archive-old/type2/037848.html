Subject: Spare Tire On Nose

On my Westy I had longer studs welded on the plate I got at Pep Boys and threaded them all the way to the plate.  With double nuts I can set the spare at any distance from the body I want.  In fact, I reversed mine and mounted the spare outside to the front and put a hubcap from a junkyard on the wheel.  Sort of a &quot;reverse continental kit effect&quot; lol.  Rob
