Subject: no oil pressure light

engine is in, and took a spin around the block. sounded good and yahoo. no
oil pressure light. i changed the bulb, grounded the switch and turned
ignition on - still no light. there is an aftermarket gauge in the clock
spot [frozen at 300*+]. what do fellers do when they hook them up? seems
the blue green wire from the dash to the switch is in tact though..ideas?
-steve
