Subject: RE:  Motor mounts?

&gt;Okay, this is probably a stupid question... but do I have to drag 
&gt;the (insert adjective of choice here) motor out again to replace the 
&gt;motor to engine carrier mounts?  I'm v. familiar with the job on a
&gt;wasserleaker, but have never done the deed on a type IV motor.  

In theory, you could replace them with the motor in the bus.  But when I
did mine recently (motor was already out for pilot bearing replacement),
I had to remove my fan shroud in order to get at the bolts that hold the
mounts to the engine.  So if you can't see a way to remove those bolts
without removing the fan shroud, you'd better blow the dust off that
floor jack and buy some beer for the sucker err... buddy who's gonna
help you pull the engine.
