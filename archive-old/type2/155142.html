Subject: type 4 case oil pressure relief

Hi all,
just a follow up on my low pressure issues, I have run the motor now with a spacer 
under the relief spring, results look promising.
The extra pressure on the spring means I get reasonable pressure on the gauge 
now (~40psi _at_2500rpm &amp; 190F oil). Max pressure at start up is ~60psi, so not too 
bad.
What it has not affected though is idle pressure, which is now ~11psi _at_700rpm &amp; 
190F oil.
So I guess that means some excess clearance on the bearings?

What pressure would you normally expect on a new motor at idle with hot oil?

Cheers,
Richard
