-&gt;You guys need to realise that women aren't built like you! - I would hope that
-&gt;you know this anyway:-) and one woman's blind spot is another man's ergonomic

Hi Gillian (and everyone else),

This comes up every now and then (well twice since I've been on the list).
Last I checked I had all the appendages that labeled me of the male gender
(and none that would classify me as a female:)  Enough so, my wife just gave
birth to our second son, Ailim Bear Psmythe!  Shameless pappa plug I know. 

No offense taken, no worries.  

Also, for more fire to fuel the cutting bus flames (and to make this post t2
legal), I've got this 75 bus I bought for $75 dollars (does the karma work
out or what?:).  The interior is non-existant, bad engine, etc.  Also a
friend with a few pieces of welding equipment (and then some) in his shop
has offered to give me some instruction and learning time with his
equipment.  I've always had a silly idea of cutting a beater bus into a
customized double cab.  Hmmmm, here is my chance:)  Anyone want to buy the
bus before I destroy it?

I doubt I'll ever find the time to do it, but it would be fun.
