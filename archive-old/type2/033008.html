 Hello All!

 I am in the process of restoring my 70 Westy  I am also planning on dressing
 up the engine compartment a bit as well.  The body is already at the shop,
 getting the treatment, and the engine is at home, in my garage. Yesterday
 I recieved my single quiet-pack and extractor from RMMW.

 I am also looking into upgrading the carb set-up as well.  Right now its
 running the stock 34 pict 3 carb, but Ive been looking at a Weber single
 progressive kit, dual 34 ICT kit, and dual Kadrons.  Any suggestions on
 which of these three would be the most reliable on a otherwise stock 1600?

 Im pretty sure that if I change the carb set up I also need to snag a 009
 distributor as well.  Could you guys confirm this for me?
 Thanks!

 Derrick Gorshe
 70 Westy getting all pretty!
