Subject: [T2] Re: Transporting a bus

Many --Many thanks to all of the listees for leads of flatbeding a 51 bus from
Santa Barbara to Phoenix--Ryan Price the Editor of VW Trends so far has come up
with the best lead!! It sure is a nice feeling to have an Editor of a leading VW
magazine show interest in someone asking for some help.--As of yet &quot;AB 51&quot; has
not left Germany--So i will have time to practice my shifting of a non-syncro
tranny--This will be a test to see if you can teach an old dog new tricks--At 64
years i could never find a VW as old as me--But this bus Is older than my
wife--My Thanks to Melissa, for backing me up on the decision to buy it!  That's
a great VW wife!!  TWWM, uj
