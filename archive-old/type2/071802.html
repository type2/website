Subject: re: Vanagon bike rack

&lt;&lt;Hi Volks,

Anyone have a good design for a 2 bike rack for the
back of a Vanagon?  Or do you have a Vanagon bike rack
for sale?  I understand the Paulchen is considered by
some the best, are there any racks that compete with
it?  Thanks.

Rob&gt;&gt;

The Fiamma is an excellent choice.  Much lower priced than the Paulchen and 
you can equip it to hold fat tube bikes.  Vanagon rack is $250 plus shipping.
