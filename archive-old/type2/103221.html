Subject: Re: [T2] removing rear brake drums

&gt; My drums do have one threaded hole - but not really enough to get it off. What
&gt; worked OK for me was to thread the lugnuts on and use a 3-arm puller centered
&gt; on the hub and grabing the lug nuts. You want to be VERY, VERY careful to
&gt; apply pressure steadily and make sure the arms are pulling straight. You don't
&gt; want to bend your studs.

There is a 5 arm puller especially made for the vw drums. well for the
wide5 drums for sure I dont know much about later ones.
hoover had a lot of discourse about it in one of his stories
lemme see.........
cant find it at the moment its the one when he went up to washington to
collect a bus and it had seized drums. he couldnt find the proper puller,
got a 3 arm, didnt do it ended up cutting the drum off
real classic hoover. fun and informative.
