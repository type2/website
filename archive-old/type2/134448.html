Subject: FREE*   #2

Ok, the flaps went quick...... Here is another Free* 'you know want it' deal!

Went to the yards this morning at 8AM....... sorry, no flaps..... BUT I did find a 
real! type4 sump plate with the oil temp sender in it. Not a POS re-drilled sump plate.
No sir-ee, this is the real deal....... [sorry, the clamshell 1/2 cover was missing]

Here is how the Free* deal works:
The 1st person that pmails me that they want it and makes a donation to http://www.type2_dot_com/donate.html
gets it Free* from me......
