GMB/All,


I hate to say it, but $32,500.00 for a fully restored
'60 23-Window seems to be fair.....by *current*
standards.

Obviously, the fact that the ad says it's an automatic
is a serious brain-fart on someone's part!

Personally, if I had an extra $32.5 laying around, I
wouldn't waste it on this particular bus. I'd resto my
'69 Westy, pay off my bills and take a much-needed
vacation!


Damn....my first bus was a '57 23 window that I got in
'82 for $150.00. It was entirely original (though
shot) and even came with the hand-crank and gas-lid
key. I sold it 6 months later for $300.00.......at
least I made a profit!

Also...if this bus only has 1,000 original miles on it
(as the ad implies), it would be worth FAR more!!!


See Ya in the funnies!
