Subject: [T2] coil wires?


&gt;Trying to get '71 with 1600DP running.. on the coil, there are 6 spades for
&gt;wires, three on each side of the coil wire.  Can someone tell me where the
&gt;wires go? Green one and white ones.... I can get it to crank.. but will not
&gt;turn over...

The coil is marked + (15) and  - ( 1 ) near the spade terminals.
You may have to unbolt it to see the markings, so be sure to
scrape those spades clean.
The + side goes to ignition 12 v. input power, and may also be the
connection for an electromagnetic fuel cut-off wire and also a choke
heating element wire, both wires going to the carburetor, and may be
any color wire, depending on who installed them.
The  - side of the coil is for the green wire coming from the distributor,
it is the trigger for the coil, and involves the points and condenser.
Look at the points and see if the wire ( inside the cap )  is not burnt from
accidental misconnection. There is more, but let's start there.
