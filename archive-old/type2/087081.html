&gt; &gt; &gt;It is true that you don't want to exceed 30-32 on a wedge chamber (no semi

&gt; What we call &quot;vacuum advance&quot; distributors are't really advancing with

huh???  how do the Fuel Injected ones work then, no carb yes the vacuum is
in the air intake flow but not part of either the Carb or Fuel injectors.
