&gt;The fastidious answer: Pull the engine at 300 miles and retorque. Then
&gt;you will not have to worry about it.

I was given this answer when I bought my new engine and still had to drive 1500
miles before I got home. But they told me, well, just remove the rockers and torque
the bottom 4. That idea has never sat well with me, but I was scared and I listened.

&gt;Slip a torque wrench and give it a turn. _Don't_ torque it up. If your indicator is showing around 15-20 ft
&gt;lbs and the wrench is still turning, you need to retorque.

This is true and what I did on the bottom four nuts on each side. Unfortunately, I didn't have the Wilson
book with me, only the Bentley and Muir. So when I got home and pulled the motor the other day I
noticed that I have a Brasilian Case with mexican heads, not a mexican case. The main dilemma here
is I have 8mm head studs with case savers, not 10mm head studs. Therefore my final torque is only
18 foot pounds!!!!!! I overtightened my head studs and drove about 15 miles with them like that. Wilson
tells me that means stretched studs. Everything is retorqued properly to 18fp now, and I'm going to
try it without replacing the studs, but be aware of what size studs you have and remember that final torque
on 10mm studs is 23footpounds, but final torque on 8mm studs is 18footpounds.
