Hello. I've did a few Subaru conversions, it is quite simple. In fact the
hardest thing is to choose where you'll put the radiator; before you had two
choice cut the front or the back. But lately I've come up with another
solution, KEP in their catalog state that the Subaru1800cc opposed four only
need a 300 inches square rad, so I'll try to put two small Renault 5
radiator( one in each air intake on the side at the back of the bus. (If
you're interested just send me mail and I'll tell you how it went). 

If you're  considering to put a Subaru engine in a VW, don't forget to have
a bearing installed in the center of the Subaru Crank so it don't shake
excessively. And don't forget that you'll have REAL
(or two REAL) heater, that means that if you want to ride in your bus in
t-shirts and shorts in the middle of the winter by minus 10f you'll be able
(it's been done believe me).

 Happy holidays for everyone!
