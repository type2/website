Subject: Decel Valve?

Greetings One and All,

I think my decel valve has gone south.  I did the Bentley test and it flunked
with
flying colors.  The main symptom is a very high idle after warm-up.

My auxiliary air regulator doesn't seem up to snuff either.  The idle speed
right after starting is kind of slow, but not too.  I wonder if the high
ambient air temp helps keep the initial idle speed at a decent rpm?  BTW, I
can blow air through it when cold, but it's damn hard.

&gt;From my moderately informed point of view, they both could use to be replaced.
Prob is, I really hate to lay out bucks when the most serious problem is a
high idle 
(sounds like about 1100 rpm).  

Sean, do decel valves commonly give problems?  I see you didn't list them on
your 
FI site.

Would appreciate any advice...wise or otherwise.
