&gt;	I see little prospect for increasing the pressure, and none

But remember, I said at higher speeds (50+ or so) the air temp going
into the fan approaches the outside temps within a minute or so. Which
shows that air ramming into the scoops keeps that radiant engine heat
diluted.  It's at slower speeds that the fan sucks in the hot engine
compartment heat since not as much air is being forced into the scoops.

What I want to try is taking something like metal clothes dryer ducting
and have it got from the scoop area to right in front of the fan intake.
You arent losing anything at high speeds, but maybe at low speeds, the
fan will be able to pull in &quot;cooler&quot; air. This may not work unless I
totally seal the fan intake. Maybe a metal bowl or a plastic bowl that
can handle the heat, drill large holes to attach the ducts. It'll be
cheap enough to try and I can see what the air temp is going into
fan.

&gt;
&gt;	One idea I've toyed with is to slap a low-drag gauze on the
&gt;intake to the fan, and trickle water by gravity onto that from a
&gt;narrow pipe across its top with several holes during max-power
&gt;bursts.  The latent heat of evaporation of water is a peculiarly high
&gt;number  -  the basis of many simple tropical cooling systems  -  so
&gt;this should give the cooling fins cooler air.
&gt;
&gt;	Having brutally hammered Darren's idea (perhaps thru
&gt;misunderstanding it)  I now brace myself for enrubbishments of mine.

I have thought about this too, but just using a mister. Look at
mistymate_dot_com. Attach a small pump and have it mist water into the air.
...just a thought.
