Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Issues

Richard and list,

I let the engine run today and everything is normal. The noise gradually 
went away and was totally gone after 15 min. max. the smoke came out of the 
exhaust for even less time and is totally gone now.  It was thick, I don't 
know what or why or how???  The engine is just as it was before I pulled it 
but starts easier. I used to have to step on the gas pedal a bit.  Now I 
lean in and turn the key. I replaced several hoses and I think this has 
helped. The noise had to be the lifters.

I checked end play, it was within spec. I used the screw type bolt on thing 
and a feeler gauge.

Most exciting is that I took the bus out for a test drive.  First time in 
about a year and a half. It sure was a boost in moral. Finally some reward 
for hours and months of labor. Still need to adjust some things (like the 
shifter stop plate, and clutch). Finally I can see the end of the 
restoration tunnel and the beginning of a long road trip.

My clutch cable seems long. The wing nut is maxed out (new cluch). Can they 
strech this much? I've had this issue on other busses in the past. I am 
going to get a new one and see what happens.

Next is to redo the front end. I did this before it went to the paint shop 
but the torsion bars I used are apparently in upside down from the way the 
were in what ever bus they came from. Now the bus is sitting and sprung on 
the rubber bumpers. My plan is to get some myself from a local junkyard, 
label them and put it back together. The torsion bars that were on the bus 
when I got it had several broken leaves.

I do plan on adjusting the valves (1 turn) soon and resetting the timing. So 
far I think I got all the oil leaks except one valve cover gasket that I 
will get when I do the valves.

After the front end is brakes and then the interior then vacation.

Thanks,
Brandt in Utah
