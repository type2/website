Subject: Re: [T2] Carb Cleaner

Matthew,

Don't know where you are, but I picked one up several months ago
at Autozone.  Noticed they also had them at the local O'Reilly's.

Yes, it is paint can size, smells bad and will burn you a little.
Wash off with water when finished cleaning.

I believe mine was made by chemtool.._dot_comes with a little metal strainer 
inside and was sitting on the bottom shelf just below all of the other
carb cleaner type stuff that doesn't go into your gas tank.

Yes, you do need this...diesel won't really do.  You could use several
small cans of liquid b-12 chemtool also...very explosive!

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hey there-
&gt; 
&gt; I am going to rebuild my carbs on my '73 (34-PICT 3,4) today and have a
&gt; question: The article in the library on this subject mentioned a carb cleaner
&gt; that comes in something like a paint can that you can actually dip parts into.
&gt; Sounds like a great idea, but just got me a blank look at my local FLAPS. My
&gt; question is this: Is there anything special in carb cleaner? Could I use
&gt; another solvent (diesel perhaps)? Also, are there any good resources other
&gt; than the Robert Kuhn article, or any tips for someone who has never opened a
&gt; carb before?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Matthew
