         And even the sales of the 1600 might be tax driven. There seem to be an
awful lot of very tiny engined vehicles in Europe because of high vehicle taxes.
Another reason is that Europe is much more heavily urbanized than NA.  If you're
driving in the city all the time, a 1200 would probably be sufficient.
