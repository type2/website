Hi Volks!

Ever drove a 914?  They may be ugly, but they move.  Boy, do they move.
And they also are open, which is a huge plus in my book.  I'm not at 
all particular to sports cars, but the 914 is a great one.

&gt; So my compromise
&gt; is the 912 (not the 1976 version). 

Why not the '76 912 E?  Unlike the early model 912, which has basically
a 356 engine, the 912 E has a Type 4.  Parts should be much easier to
get for that one.

&gt; Any other comments/advice?

Develop a healthy ignorance to money issues.  Have fun.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
