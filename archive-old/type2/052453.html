Subject: [T2] Front Rubber Needed (231 867 765)

Volks,

1978 Westy; need the rubber mats which surround the seat pedestals and cover
the little storage areas under the seats, part # from orig is 231 867 765.
...Checked Bus Depot and Bus Boys with no luck, in fact, Bus Boys
recommended I should post the request here.  They only have the rubber up to
76: is there much of a difference?

Anyone know of where I could get my hands on a set?  Mine are torn.

TIA
