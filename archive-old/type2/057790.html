&gt; It's Friday so I want to try and clear up something that has
bothered me for a
&gt; while...
&gt; 
&gt; I read somewhere (can't remember where) that because of the cut off
rear end, a
&gt; bus is MORE aerodynamic than a bug. 

Way back when I was in engineering school (As I recall we took notes
on sheets of sandstone with chisels) this very topic came up.  I don't
remember the exact numbers, but the coefficient of drag of a bus is
indeed less than that of a bug.  

The bus is actually a much more aerodynamic shape, with a nicely
rounded and blended front end and a fairly abrupt cutoff in the rear. 
This tends to keep the airflow attached and free of major disturbances
until it leaves the bus at the rear.

The bug has a really bad shape for drag.  The nose isn't bad, but the
flat windshield and abrupt windshield-to-roof transition separates the
flow and causes a huge eddy over the top and sides of the bug.  The
bulging fenders also dirty things up.

Now, if the Cd of a bus is less than that of a bug, shouldn't a bus be
able to go faster than a bug?  Sorry, but no.  Remember that the Cd is
simply the ratio of the drag of a particular shape with that of a flat
plate of the same frontal area.  Even though the bus has a lower Cd,
it has a much larger frontal area and therefore higher drag.  Such is
the price we pay to be able to carry seven happy people around!
