Subject: Hot Running 73 Westy

My 73 Westy has been running hot since buying it two
years ago.  I have been on this list for a year and a half and have
read all the discussions regarding high engine temps.  I still have
not found my source of extra heat.  This weekend, coming home from
Maine, I was hitting my usual 250 temps on the highway.  This is what
I have:  Twin Solex carbs, 87 Octane, Speed 60-63 mph, 10w-30 oil,
70F outside temp, 36-40 degree BTDC _at_ 3000 RPM's, 115 psi in all four
cylinders.  40-45 psi oil pressure at 60 mph/250F.

Jeff,
I'd be inclined to question your temp reading. My own experience tells me
that you're not likely to maintain that high a pressure with 30w oil at 250*.
Every situation is probably different but I would bet that you aren't as hot
as you think. In similar temps this weekend my 81 Westy with 20/50 synthetic
at 55 to 60mph managed oil temps of about 210 to 220 and pressure of about 35
to 40psi. In warmer weather 230* to 250* and 30 psi is more like it.
