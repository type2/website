Hello all!

     Yesterday a friend of mine left for Las Vages, being windy she took
a one lane highway that way she could take her time, 
     So yesterday I was at my friend Steve's place when he got the call
from Liz, saying she wrecked her bus, and that she needed his truck and
flat bed trailer, so he left last nite to go get her, She was a good 1
1/2 to 2 hours away. They got back pretty late.

     So today I go to Steve's shop where the bus is at, It is not a
pretty site. Liz was there, She didn't get hurt, just a little shaken
up. Liz said she was going along when a big gust of wind blew her off of
the road, down into a ditch, up over a cross road, where she went air
borne(since most of the weight was in the back, and bus fully loaded)
she landed were the rear wheels hit first, ripped off the rear bumper
with tow hitch hooked into frame, muffler, and the rear wheels are
sitting bowed way out  /         \   she tried to drive it back, but   /
\  there was no way she would make it back on her own. 

I'll try to get picture's tomorrow. Lesson, be careful in strong winds,
our beloved bus's don't handle very good in strong winds.

Thanks,
Shawn Reed
