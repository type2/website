Subject: Re: [T2] On FI

Hi Sean,
&gt; Not sure what e-mails you are talking about
&gt; regarding changes in altitude or
&gt; temperature, haven't seen any of those on the list. 
&gt; Strange you bring that
&gt; up, as FI does take care of those issues :-)
Actually I was referring to a number of emails that
were from people stranded when their FI died in the
mountains when it had been set for hot coastal
weather.
Hey,I'm not making this up....just calling it as I see
it.
Surely you saw these.
Cheers
Andrew
