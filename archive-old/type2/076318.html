Subject: Re: [T2] Push Button Starter

Here is the starting sequence:
Ignition key turned to starting position: Fuel Pump On/Cold Start
Injector On/Starter Motor On/Ignition Coil On/ECU On (other instruments
etc on)
Ignition key in run position: Fuel Pump Passed off to [ECU/AFM/Double
Relay] /Ignition Coil On/
So if you want to bypass that ignition switch you need to have a standard
ignition switch and a starter button.
That Vanagon Ignition switch fits a lot of VWs, not just Vanagons but a
lot of others as well. They are normally &quot;Gimmies&quot; at the wrecking yards
I go to as long as I've got $25.00 of other bigger stuff.
In addition the switch has a solder (fused) point in it that can be
repaired.
I've found the turn the key  = nothing to be loose push on connectors at
the starter or solenoid plunger locked by light coating of dust/grease
buildup.

&gt; Volks,
&gt; After a lot of testing/contemplation, I think I am going to rig a 
&gt; push button for my starter on my 81 vanagon.  It has the classic 
&gt; turn the key nothing syndrome.......I can put a rench between the 
&gt; battery lead and terminal 30(maybe 50) and it cranks right up....new 
&gt; solenoid, same result...different good starter, same 
&gt; result.............. Checked ignition switch seems 
&gt; fine................3rd time in 1 1/2 years, and i already have the 
&gt; Bosch wr-1 kit installed.  Rewiring is a possibility (seems to lose 
&gt; 1 volt from switch to starter on the starter end at the ignition 
&gt; switch lead. Prior to this last bout I had been popping fuses in the 
&gt; WR-1 relay kit.....15 amp ones.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Is there somewhere on the net that gives a how to?  Would like to 
&gt; have it work only when key is on, then mash button to engage.
