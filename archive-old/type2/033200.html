Subject: transmission of mystery

    Well my mystery is getting closer to being solved (I hope). Today I
put my bus on jack stands and listened to the sounds of the transmission
in first, neutral and reverse with a metal rod as a stethoscope. The
noises were loudest in reverse and were coming from the upper front of
the transmission (where the gears live). When I changed the oil in the
gearbox, there were no chunks or even slivers of metal to be found. So,
here is my conclusion: it's not good. If anyone has an opinion on
whether I should buy I good used or rebuilt transmission I'd love to
hear why and where I could find one. If anyone has a guess as to what
appears to be wrong with my transmission (loud clacking in reverse) and
whether it can be fixed by a marginally talented mechanic (me) feel free
to let me know.
    Also, I just replaced my 34PICT3 carb with a brand spanking new one
and guess what? It didn't work. I couldn't get it to idle. I followed
all the tune up and adjustment procedures and got nothing. Does anyone
know if new carbs frequently or even occasionally arrive D.O.A.? Before
I send it back I'd like to know if it can be tweaked to spare me the
postage and trouble. I put my old carb back on and it runs fine. So why
change it you ask? Well the choke is broke and one of the studs is
stripped out and the other is missing so I figure why not upgrade.
Take it easy,
Jeff
