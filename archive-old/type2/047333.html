Subject: [T2] RE:FI Coughing

I missed the original article on the 10years sitting FI engine
coughing. One good diagnostic tool with FI, is to wiggle all the
electrical connectors, preferably with the engine running.
This should include the octopus of grounds that is bolted to the engine case
underneath the air distributor box which is the bagpipe bag shaped, or
kidney shaped
black can in the middle of the top of the engine with all the big rubber
pipes attached.
Also all the connectors on the firewall.
Bad electrical connections, or grounds are the source of many FI problems,
especially the
intermittent ones.

DO change the fuel hoses before you drive very much. I learned a lot about
FI
rebuilding my engine room after the fire;-(

Bill - why is there more way more thick white smoke when I hit the gas? -
