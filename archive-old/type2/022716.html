Michael Hogg asked:
&gt;&gt; Does anyone have any info on this? Clipped from MSN: &quot;...Last but not
least will be a New Samba concept styled at VW's Simi Valley design studio
in Southern California. Reportedly, this seven-passenger, multi-purpose
vehicle with design cues taken from VW's venerable old microbus from the
1960s and '70s is meant to gauge public
&gt; reaction to a possible new VW van/activity vehicle. We can't wait to weigh
&gt; in....&quot; &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
I read in Automotive News several months ago that VW was having an extremely
hard time meeting US safety specs with a flat-face Bus design and had
already scrapped this concept.  I hope they can make it work without making
it a 'NewBus' like the 'NewBeetle' but it seems what drove this concept was
a desire to cash in on the nostalgia craze the NB had in the US market.
Calling it a Samba...hmmm...

John
