Subject: advice on my van (sorta long)
Message-ID: &lt;001301beb7c7$b02a7520$3159fed0_at_default&gt;

Ok... after  about 3 months with my 80 Vanagon and lurking on the list I
have found several things:

1. The P.O. was an idiot

2. The notch on my dizzy (009) is NOT lined up with the 1st cylinder firing
point. (It's lined up with #2) Is this a real problem? (The van runs pretty
good)

3. There are no flaps or a thermosat (see #1)]

4. I don't think I have and EGR valve (what the heck is it supposed to look
like?)

5. The FI was replaced by a Weber progressive carb (see #1) which I know
nothing about.

6.  My spark plugs have dry black deposits on them... what would cause that?

7. I have a mystery valve/vaccume thing at the front left of my
compartment... on end (with rubber hose) is plugged with a screw, the other
(metal one) is not attached to anything.

8.  The expansion tanks on the fuel tank are disconected and I have pressure
in the tank (see #1).

Ok heres some background on what I have done/been doing....
1. I put a compu-fire ignition in the dizzy because points scare me:)
2. I have been using 20W-50 and I live in Florida
3. Sealed a leak at the gas tank filler tube (which is the cause of the
pressure)
4. Keeping it timed _at_ 7.5 BTDC _at_ ~900 rpm
5. Put duct tape over all the misc. holes in the tin.

I apologize for all the dumb questions which I could probably find answers
to in the archives but I dont want to spend hours in the archives and come
up with nothing.

If you cant tell, this is my first VW and really my first time trying to
understand what Everything in an engine is supposed to do.  It just seems
like even with a newly rebuilt engine (~6000 miles on it) that there is a
whole lot wrong.

If anyone can find the time to help a newbie out I'd really appreciate it.
I have looked for someone knowledgeable in my area to no avail and you guys
are the only ones I can turn to. (Muir and Haynes can only help so much with
the setup I have.)

Thanks Volks
