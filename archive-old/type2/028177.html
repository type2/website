Hello listmembers....

So the cosmetics of my bus have recently gotten my attention and I have a 
few ideas.

One thing that sucked is over new years even someone decides they would dig 
the deepest grooves they could with a key on my rear door, granted I wasn't 
in the best area of town but geez.... This got me started on how things 
look, just so your up to speed.

I saw a bus some time ago with the spare tire mounted on the nose, nothing 
new. But he had it set up like a regular tire, with the little chrome hubcap 
in the center. The rim was painted nicely the color of the bus as the rest 
had been.
My spare tire I don't think ever could hold the cap because of its 
shape/difference from the stock rims, but even if I had a extra stock 
rim/tire combo instead would those bolts coming from the tire mount stick 
out so far you couldn't get the centercap on, or if that going to be the 
easy solution - simply pick up a stock rim from a junk yard and use that for 
my spare after I paint it to match my current rims?

Im guessing its more involved than this, but if anyone knows better??? that 
would make my day.

feeling in need of a new look,
Christopher
75' Transporter 'ruby'

and one little extra question I just thought of because I always wondered 
about going back to the emblem instead of mounting the tire on the front - 
Are the places where the emblem clipped into probably missing now that I 
have holes to screw in the spare tire mount, or if I could sorta 'patch' 
things up a little could I still attach the emblem?
I probably won't do that ever, but ya never know. If I ever picked up the 
hightop Ive always wanted maybe ill try and switch back to more of a stock 
transporter look.

all done ranting......
my sunday pattern of thought.
&quot;how can I create more work for myself...., oh right the bus!&quot;
