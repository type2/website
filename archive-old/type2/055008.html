Subject: Re: Observations on Bus Owners Driving Techniques

Hi,

Glad this topic came up. I'm a new bus driver and I don't know how/when to
shift. We don't have a tach yet and I'm trying to shift based on the sound
of the engine while driving and how much power it gives me after I shift.
I'm mainly shifting based on VW's recommendations but then in the Muir book
they say to stay in third until 45 miles per hour! Sounds like the engine is
going to explode or something but it could be just the echo inside the bus
that I'm not used to... I have no idea.

I have to say that I do 'push' the bus more than my guy who babies it to the
point where drivers are ready to ram us from behind. I'm always saying
&quot;uh... you CAN go a LITTLE faster...&quot;  I feel that doing 5 miles under the
speed limit while traffic is doing an average of 10 miles OVER it is a bit
dangerous. Now that I've got the hang of driving the bus it is really fun
and not so scary anymore. She does have some pep but it scares me to rev it
so high before shifting. I know it's bad for the engine to shift too early
though. Can you guys tell me at what speeds you shift at to help me out?
Maybe I can overcome this fear. What RPMs are recommended for the type 2
1600 engine?

Thanks,
Jen :-)

&gt;These folks observed a max. shift point RPM of
2500. Always. Then claimed that the eng. was not rebuilt correctly as it
&quot;lacked power&quot;. When I attemped to explain that they had just begun to get
into the power band at 2500RPM, &gt;  [snip]
