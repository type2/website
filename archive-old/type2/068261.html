Subject: Re: Sources for windshield gasket for '81 Vanagon westy

&gt;VW wants $125 or so.  Anyone had experiences with non-VW gaskets.
&gt;Opinions?

I looked into this when I replaced the windshield in my '85 a few months 
back.  Turns out nobody makes 'em but VW.  (Even the WCM one is the same, 
and priced the same as the dealer one.)  At the time, Bus Boys was 
threatening to make their own, but I got the distinct impression it would 
be some time down the road.  Might be worth a call, though.  
Best price I was able to get was 10% off dealer price for the dealer part, 
so I bought that.  I bought the one without the moulding stip, though (same 
price), only because those moulding strips get pretty ugly as they age.
