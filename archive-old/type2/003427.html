Good point. What I should have done was attach the 12 feet of wire and put
the probe into boiling water then check the reading. Actually, it would not
be much of a hassle for me test it this way now. Just have to disconnect
some pinch connectors.  Would added resistance generally create readings
that were higher or lower than w/o the added resistance (don't own an
O-scope)? BTW, the archives contain a couple of posts that suggest that the
tip of a dipstick gauge reads from the same area as the sensor that screws
into the sump. Don't know for sure.

Thanks

&gt; Sounds great the only problem I can see is if the extra feet of wire
causes
&gt; increased resistance(which it should unless you place something to account
&gt; for the extra resistance with-in the circuit.) it would not operate
exactly
&gt; on. I don't know if it does but if you have an O-scope you could check it
to
&gt; make sure. I don't really know enough electronics to say more but I am
sure
&gt; someone on this list does.

&gt; &gt; John,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am gonna take a shot at describing my experience with making a dip
stick
&gt; &gt; temp gauge
