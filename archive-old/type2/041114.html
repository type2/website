Subject: RE:  Newbie: Carbs and header Questions

&gt;1. Im getting some dual 40mm IDF carbs and need to know what you guys
&gt;reccommend for proper jetting for best daily driveability for the 2000 cc
&gt;motor. (ie: main, emulsion tubes, idle etc.. I need to know what to order
&gt;with the carbs) Do you guys reccommed the 40s or the 44s more?

40s are more than big enough for a stock or mild performance 2.0.  Leave the 
44s for the 140-160 HP 914 racers.  If you have your choice of setups when 
ordering the carbs, go for 40 IDFs with 32mm main venturis, F7 emulsion tubes, 
125 main gas, either 185 or 190 air jets (185 if low elevation, 190 if 2000 ft 
or higher), and 50 idles.  

And make sure the crossbar linkage they are sending is a GOOD one.  Don't let 
them send you the cheap piece-o-crap bugpack one.  My preferrence is the Weber 
x-bar.  Very solid, easy to adjust, and stays adjusted.

If you're planning on setting and maintaining the carbs yourself you'll also 
want to order a synchronizing tool.  My preferrence is the synchrometer (about 
$50), but others say the unisyn (about $30) works well too.

One of the most common and mis-diagnosed problems when setting up dual carbs is 
intake leaks around the manifolds.  A leak here will make it seem like one side 
of the motor isn't firing.  It will also hurt accelleration and top-end speed.  
I finally gave in and used some gasket sealer on both sides of the block/gasket 
pieces.

&gt;I have a progressive carb kit for the 1800.. will the intake manifold
&gt;runners and kit fit the 2000 heads w/out modification? 

All the type IV bus heads have the same intake bolt pattern and openings.  The 
79 heads, as you know, have sqaure exhaust ports, but that won't affect your 
intakes.  The only type IV head that has different intake openings is the 73-76 
914 2.0 heads (they have 3-bolt intakes instead of 4-bolt).

Hope this helps.  If you need more help with the carbs, let me know.  I ran 
dual 40's on my 1.8 bus for 8 years and dual 44's (too big, but I had a set 
sitting around) on my 2.0 914 for 3 years.  Now they're both d-jet fuel 
injected 2.0's.  Quiter, better gas mileage, but I miss the simpicity and clean 
look of the dual Webers.
