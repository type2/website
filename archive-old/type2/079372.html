Subject: Re: [T2] turn signal indicator works only in one side

My 74 Riviera has a single light on the dash with both left and right arrows
on it. When the signal is activated the light flashes illuminating both
arrows. The lens is so small that there's no way two bulbs would fit behind
it, besides that fact that even if there were two bulbs, either buld
lighting up would illuminate both arrows since they're on a single lens.

&gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My 71 Westy blinks the right side of turn indicator in the guage even I
make
&gt; &gt; left turn. So it blinks whenever I signal right AND left... I inspected
the
&gt; &gt; wiring and the wire splits off of the right to left. So I switched so
the
&gt; &gt; split off from left to right, but no blinking on either of them, but I
could
&gt; &gt; still hear the flasher...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Does anyone know what is happening?
&gt;
&gt; They all blink both sides in that era.  Kind of silly, and I think that VW
&gt; intended to split the circuit into left and right sides later on.  Did it
&gt; ever happen toward the end of the baywindows?
