Subject: Asbestos (again)

Hi All!
I reread the archive on the asbestos thing with some alarm.  I had to drop off
this list for a year and I had not heard that vwoa is no longer  performing the
asbestos clean up on our busses.  Don't mean to start a flame war so I withhold
my opinion on this.  The question: My 74 has the original &quot;factory jacket&quot;
around the heater tube that extends the length of the bus.  Does anyone know if
this is asbestos (it is white where the outer cover has eroded)?  There is a lot

of it (about 5 feet long) and it's going to be a real hassle to have it tested,
and remove/dispose of it properly.

Thanks in advance!

Dave.
74bus.
(may your asbestos rest in peace).
