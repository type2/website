Subject: Re: [T2] BUS &quot;Gutters&quot;

The most important thing is to keep them clean and free of debris, just like
the rain gutters on your house. They tend to fill up with leaves and dirt,
and when they do, that's when they don't perform properly and when water
stands and rusts them out. They usually don't rust but I have a Westy whose
owner parked it under a pine tree for a long time and the gutter is gone in
the back.. as is the back hatch, rotted out. There were plenty of decomposed
pine needles when I got it, but not much left of the gutter.
If you really wanted to be overly fastidious, a water repellant silicone
spray or wipe-on might be good, as long as it is compatible with your paint.
A car cover would work too, and it would protect everything.
