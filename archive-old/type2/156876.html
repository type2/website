Subject: Bus sightings (Fridayish)

Hi
Sorry this is a bit late, wireless in the hotal is a bit hit and miss.

I am now half way through my epic trip around So Cal in something that GM built.  I have so far seen very few busses at which I am very suprised.

Saw a cream tin top with a rusty roof, santa monica beach, 2 in Yosemite park, A nice Westy on a drive on CA 140 near Merced and what looked like a parking lot full of broken ones near I99.  Yesterday I found a Westy near the hotel on a very steep hill in San Francisco.  

Moving on now - where are you all or is too hot?
