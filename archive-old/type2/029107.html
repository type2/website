X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

I wanted to give an update on my tranny leak question from last week :-) It
was leaking at the front from around the bellows.

I pulled the tranny on Saturday and cleaned it up good, I have also ordered
a seal &quot;Manual Transmission Main Input Shaft Seal, 113 311 113A&quot;  I hope
this is what I need to stop the leak where I think it's coming from. Since
several people wrote and said they had the same problem I will report back
if I can successfully stop the leak. At least the tranny is clean now so I
will know more precisely the location of a leak if the seal dose not correct
the problem.

I also wonder since my drip was so small that it might have been Old Built
up Tranny Dope and Dirt, would this break down to a liquid form again when
it gets hot?

I also used some carb cleaner, very sparingly on the tranny to help clean
it, then I remembered an old VW Guru saying you should only use Gasoline to
clean the outside, as any other cleaning agent would cause the tranny case
to &quot;DRY&quot; out, something about it has a natural oil in the alloy that would
be stripped away, is this any thing to worry about? If so should I massage
some type of oil back into the case?

Thank You!

Meredith
