&gt; When I bought my 79 Westy it had single wipers, the first click up on the
&gt; wiper handle didn't work, but the second gave me wipers. The Westy's been
&gt; sitting since Jan. when I bought it. I insured it today and all of a sudden
&gt; no wipers. The first postiion is still nothing, but the second one when
&gt; selected, blows the fuse. Any ideas on this?
&gt; Thanks in advance,

Courtney:
When the wiper motor gave up on my old 78, I successfully converted one from a
71, cause that's what I had. I think I had to change some wires or something.
The older motor is actually a much higher quality unit. If there are serious
questions about what was involved, pmail me and I'll go look (78 bus gone from
terminal rust, but most essential parts down in the basement waiting for
transplant time.)
