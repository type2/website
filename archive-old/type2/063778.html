Subject: Bus Boys Where are you?

Anyone know how to get hold of Bus Boys.  I thought I sent them an
email (BusBoys_at_aol_dot_com) concerning purchasing the upper flanger to
the gas tank filler connection, but got no response. I can't get through
their toll free number (800-792-2697).  Maybe they are putting together
their catalog? I would like to replace this part, so if anyone can be of
assistance, please help me out.
