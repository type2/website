Subject: RE: [T2] what years are diesel engines available

Not to sound like an ass,.....but technically biodiesel does not need to
be converted. Biodiesel and diesel can be used in the same tank. In
fact, they are often mixed.

&quot;Grease Cars&quot; are vehicles that have been modified with a second heated
fuel tank, heated fuel lines, etc to run straight vegetable oil (SVO).
The car is started and shutdown on regular diesel (or biodiesel). After
the vegetable oil is up to temperature the engine can be switched over
and run off of vegetable oil. Before shuting down the engine it has to
be switched back over to regular diesel to clear the vegetable oil out
of the unheated fuel lines and injection system.

From what I understand, direct injection diesel engines (such as TDIs)
can not be used for vegetable oil conversion. Older technology Indirect
injection engines with precombustion chambers (such as the old rabbit
diesels) work with straight vegetable oil.

There's a ton of stuff about this out on the web.

 There is a course at a local community college in the area that
converts
diesel engines to biodiesel (grease cars) Any way, I was wondering what
years the diesel engine was available for buses?
Is it difficult to put a diesel engine in body that was originally set
up
for a gasoline engine?
Thanks,
Kyle
