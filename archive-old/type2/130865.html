Subject: N. Cal roadtrip

Hi,

Taking a Road Trip from Portland, Oregon to Garberville, California leaving 
Thurs. July 15 and coming home July 17th and going to the String Cheese 
Concert at Benbow State Park.

Also, any type2er's that are in Garberville and don't mind us pulling up to 
sleep the nite of July 16th, love to hear from you.  I was going to reserve 
a campsite at Redwoods State Park but its a 40 minute drive from Benbow 
State Park which is all full. Hopefully looking for something closer.


If anyone is going down and wants to caravan, gimme a hollar.

Keep Bussin.....

Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!
