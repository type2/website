Subject: re: Electrical System Question?

Can I ask a quick question? How did you know it was the starter? Did it turn
over OK, but not start?

I ask because I am trying to get my (new) 78 running and just _can't_ get
it. I have checked the major parts of the FI and I am getting fuel pressure
and spark and it just doesn't like me.

In the end it doesn't matter since I bought the bus for the body not the
engine (which is dropping a valve), but it bother's me. When I get the time
to swap the new engine in I really don't want to be back in the same place.

Any info that you can give would be great!

&gt; On a camping trip to the Arizona desert last weekend my 79 Westy failed to
&gt; start.  I later learned, after a one-hour trip to Sedona, that my battery was
&gt; pushing out about 12.9 volts.  I suspected the starter solenoid or starter.
