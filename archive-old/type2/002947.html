I just got lucky and  found a 71 in a junkyard north of Bay City, MI (the
rest is pretty rough, not much to salvage there).  So, it's in my garage now
and I'm inclined to install it myself.  If price is not an issue (first time
I've ever said that and meant it), what thinks you all of the best
quality/most forgiving gasket (no trim)?  One listee recommended a DEE
brand, but I have no source for that.  You still out there, bro?

Ron - I've enjoyed doing business with you, feel free to jump in, make your
case.
