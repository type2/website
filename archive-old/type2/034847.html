Subject: hellllllooooo  all!

hey all-
just thought id introduce myself (im nick, the guy behind my keyboard)
tomorrow, im goin up to PA to pick up my new bus (a 69 westy) im sooo 
excited...a guy named dave, from the ghia list is headed up with me to pick 
it up (i helped him bring back a ghia from eastern MD...that was an 
adventure, this is lookin like its gonna be even more of one!!)
im origianally from WA, but live in MD, work as a translator for the army, 
and raise starfish. other current projects i have going are a 71 ghia who is 
in need of lotsa TLC (and is patiently waiting for me to finish rebuilding 
my 914 engine for it) and a 81 mercedes 240D that just doesnt like winters 
very much! :)

well, i guess thats all for now...i wont have any questions for all of you 
till i get it home and start picking things apart...

later!
