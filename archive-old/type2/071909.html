I just pulled my GEX heads and had a close look at them.  Without even
cleaning them I can see that one of them has a large crack between the
seats, plus the #3 spark plug seized in the head when I tried to remove it,
and all of the air injection port threads were stripped.  I knew the spark
plug was going to be trouble because when I bought the heads the plug got
tight after only a few threads had gone in.  I &quot;chased&quot; the threads as far
in as I could, and put lots of anti-seize on the plug, but I guess it
wasn't enough.  The air injection ports were stripped when I got the heads,
but I couldn't tell because they were so far down in the head.  The only
good thing I can say about them was that they did last 55,000 miles without
a catastrophic failure.  The crack makes me think that a seat would have
dropped eventually, so I'm glad I pulled them.  Anyone interested in buying
a set of lightly used GEX heads?  A couple of sloppy welds, a good cleaning
and they are ready to go.  :)

The new MSHP heads are doing well - I was impressed that all of the spark
plug holes had been pre-tested and coated with anti-sieze, and the plugs
went in without any trouble.  Only problem is that the bus is &quot;bucking and
hesitating&quot; under part throttle, at any speed.  It idles perfectly.  I am
pretty sure that the MSHP heads are flowing better than the old GEX heads
did, and as a result the mixture is simply too lean.  I'm pretty sure that
going up a couple of jet sizes will fix the problem.  Also noticed a slight
ping at full throttle which may also indicate a lean mixture.  Hopefully
it's not due to the small increase in compression.  It occurs to me that
owning a bus really has to be a labor of love... most sane people would
have given up on my bus years ago - like the previous owner did.
