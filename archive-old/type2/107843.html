Vincent, and All

&gt; However, there is a German guy (Michael Knappmann) who
&gt; has the entire partsbook on his page as well. The
&gt; description of the pages is in German but I think you

Google has a language translator.  I put in the address of the web
page and it did a pretty good job of showing the whole page in
english.  It wasn't perfect, but sure was a lot better than in all
german.
