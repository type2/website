Subject: fan wiring

Volks,

Recently there was a question concerning what the blower fan was in the
engine compartment.  Well, I thought while the subject was still fresh,
could anyone enlighten me on how this is wired?  In my 74 Westy, the fan
was there but disconnected and I cannot seem to find any wires that are
supposed to go there.  There are wires in the engine compartment that were
disconnected or cut and do not go anywhere (thanks to the PO), and I would
assume that at least 2 of these would go to the fan.  Any help is
appreciated.
