I've e-mailed some questions about the technical aspects of their camper,
and that was the first question .  They may have found a European rig, with
the 1600 installed at the Werks.  At one point in their writing about
preparations, etc., they mention another mid-'70s bus they had bought in
Europe with a 1600 engine.

I've also asked about the under-bus storage, and the location of the added
water supply.

I'm assuming that rearend carrier moves easily for access to the engine
room, but it would be interesting to know the details on that installation
as well.

&gt;&gt;  A 71 engine in a 78??  Guess they don't trust the South Americans to
service fuel injection!  Yet they made it to the top of the Andes-for a
pic see:

Hope they sealed the engine well!  &lt;&lt;
