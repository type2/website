Subject: heating problems

my heater seems to be stuck on, and with all the switches off, hot air
still travels out of the ducts in to the cab. i have heard two things.
either the heater is stuck 'on' or
it is the air engine cooling system. i believe
it is stuck on but would prefer a 2nd opinion.
thanx
