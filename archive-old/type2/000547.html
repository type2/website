If anybody is interested, I'll again post the name, etc. of the gas tank
renewing place here in mid Michigan (don't laugh, take a look at a map - I
can get get NYC in less time than a trip to the west end of the upper
peninsula) that cleaned and lined my bus tank.  It cost me $165, and I think
he gave me a break, but it's cleaned and coated inside and out with miracle
plastic, lifetime guaranteed.  Could have bought a new one (but never could
find anyone who carried one) for about that, but I will NEVER have rust in
it again.  Nice thought.
