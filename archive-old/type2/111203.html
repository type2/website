Subject: Re: [T2] Differences from vw pancake to Porsche 914 pancake

Hello,

I have done the 914 conversion. I am just waiting on
my 70 amp alternator cooling boot to arrive in the
mail as soon as it does I will be able to drive it. (I
need to do more work on getting it to stop :)

Any way, I used the 2L 914 engine. There is a link
that you can go to that says how much horse power the
different engines will produce according to the engine
serial number. Can some one fill me in on this? 

I am mainly familiar with the 2L 914 engine. Most of
the parts on this engine are the same (or similar)as a
2L Bus engine.  One of the main differences is the
heads. These heads are made to run at a higher
compression ratio. This creates more horse power and
heat. One other thing about these heads is they use 3
studs and nuts on each head to attach the intake
manifold rather then 4 like the Bus. I modified a set
of bus Fuel injection intake manifolds to fit this
engine. All I did was mark the new holes on the
flanges and drill. Here is a picture of the completed
manifold.

The spark plug angle is different on the 914 as well.
The 914 has more horizontal holes while the bus has
more vertical holes Here is a picture of the ones on
my engine.

The dip stick and oil fill neck are located on top of
the engine instead of the rear like a Bus. This worked
out fine for me. The only thing I have to do different
when changing the oil or checking the dip stick is to
access them from the top engine compartment hatch that
is under the westy bed cushion. I just use a long
funnel to add oil. Here is a picture.

I was able to use a 77 Bus fuel injection with this
engine. If you have a fuel injected bus already, than
this conversion is easy. Just modify the manifolds
like I did in the picture. 

As far as the all important engine tin is concerned,
this depends on what style of heat exchangers and
exhaust you go with. I use an Bug Pack Exhaust with
72-74 style heat exchangers. This requires you to use
a mis-match set of engine tin from a couple different
years of Bus. Most of the 914 engine tin will not work
with a Bus, you have to use Bus pieces. Karl sold me
the pieces that I was looking for. The only thing I
had to do was cut out new spark plug holes in the tin
because 914 spark plug holes are set at a different
angle. Refer to the spark plug angle picture.

Also, the inspection plate on the bottom of the 914
engine will have a oil temp (or was it pressure)
sensor made into it. I can't remember which at the
moment. 

The 2L 914's heads will generally run hotter than on a
bus. Keep that in mind. I still have to hook up my
temp gages. Any way, those are just some thing that I
know (or think I know) about the 914 conversion. I
can't say anything on performance yet. I have not
driven it with this engine yet. Good Luck!

Regards,
David Kelly

&gt; Hey everyone, new to this vw Bus thing, but getting

&gt; looks to be difficult, the 
&gt; next thing I was thinking, and have heard, that the
&gt; Porsche 914 engine, is a
