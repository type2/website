Subject: FI Reversion update, Day II

Hi Volks,

Day II of the FI install on the Westfakia has been slow but steady.

The BIG &quot;annoyance du jour&quot; for today was the discovery that the plenum 
would not fit between the intake runners. Strange. Some careful 
measurement and the judicious employment of my trusty angle-grinder 
soon made things fit much better. Then it was discovered that the 
runners didn't quite line up with the plenum ports. But after some 
persuasion I was able to get them to fit properly. I also discovered 
that I have a Jetta fuel pump, rather than a bus pump. That will get 
swapped out tomorrow. These are the joys of piecing together a system 
from a parts pile rather than obtaining a complete system from a donor 
vehicle.

So far I have the following FI components installed:

Thermo Time Switch
Aux Air Regulator
Air Distribution plenum and throttle body, with plugged off EGR port.
Intake runners
Head Temp sensor II
S-Hose
3-4 side injectors and fuel rail.

The 1-2 side injectors are ready to go on, but a thunderstorm started, 
dinner time came up, and my back is getting sore. And the Sopranos are 
on tonight...

I put a few pics online, you can have a look here to see how it's going 
so far. The red and white color scheme I have going in the engine 
compartment is looking pretty good.

Tomorrow I'll get the vacuum lines done, and if I have time I will get 
the engine bolted back up to the tranny. Thank goodness for Civic 
holidays.

Happy trails,
