Subject: engine sound when clutching

Was taking 71 Riviera to shop yesterday, when , no power, would only go
about 30-40MPH.... and... when stepping on clutch, the engine sounded like
it was reviving pretty fast.  Any ideas on what would cause this?
Also.... the engine got pretty hot and died... but.. after sitting and
cooling down, it did start again.... sounds like maybe a rod knocking....
(hope not)....drove it up on a trailor and it is now sitting at the shop
ready for an engine pull.
Any ideas would be appreciated.....
Thanks
Gail Doles
