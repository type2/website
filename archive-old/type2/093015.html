Subject: Re: [T2] '77 Engine Pull


&gt;I'm in the process of pulling the engine on my 77' Westy (2.0L FI CA
&gt;emmssions).  I've got everything on top disconnected and most of the stuff
&gt;on the bottom.  I'm getting ready to start on the exhaust stuff (after I go
&gt;buy a can of WD-40) I had several questions, hopefully someone who's been
&gt;there can shed some insight...

PB Blaster is better. WD-40 is pretty low ont he food chain. Or try some 
Kroil.

I'm told hot parafin is even better. (Candle Wax)

&gt;7.  I'm guessing it would be easier to remove exhaust components before
&gt;dropping the motor?  I don't want to bend them.

Saves weight. Go for it.

I see where $ is an issue but you are considering a high end rebuild or an 
AVP rebuild...
I'm confused. You've got a budget or not?

Build it yourself. Nobody is going to take the time and interest that you do.

If you buy a rebuild you won't get back your engine - you get back somebody 
else's engine with an unknown past. Keep your engine if you know it.
