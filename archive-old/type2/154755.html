Subject: Re: [T2] Interior heat should be independent of the thermostat
  ??

Here's some good heat info:   http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/Heating.html

I was just reading this and had a thought.

Ratwells site says: 
&quot;Hot air exits the heat exchangers and travels into two short tubes connecting the heat exchangers to the heat control boxes sometimes called flapper boxes. This is where the controls on the dash decide whether the heat continues on through the accordian tubes to the front of the bus or exit to the outside. You would think that VWs needing all of the air they could possibly get for cooling wouldn't be wasting any of it and the VW enginers would have put extra controls in place but it would appear it complicated the system too much and VW was able to generate enough airflow for cooling purposes.&quot;
From reading this I was thinking about airflow, Gale Banks says that three 90's equal a plug, and I guess he went on to explain that in a run of pipe any number of bends that make up 270 degrees equals a plug, so two 45s and two 90's also equal a plug (http://www.bankspower_dot_com/ this was relayed to me from my dad who was talking to Mr. Banks about turbo plumbing, its a rule of thumb he uses)
Now I know a heat control box isn't three 90 degree elbows but it probably knocks down airflow so hard at the beginning of its journey that their isn't much left to be affected by the elbows at the front.
What if I replaced my heat control boxes with smooth straight pipes and controlled my heat as close to my dash as possible with one giant heat control box????
Part of the reason this interests me is because my cables don't work right now and I reinstalled the heat control box zip ties the PO had installed, if I lost the heat control boxes I wouldn't need to worry about restoring the original system anymore.
Thoughts?
Thank you,
