Les and VWtroopers-
I have always been under the impression that the wise old man (er,
&quot;person&quot;~excuse me ladies!) are wise because they have secretly have made
every mistake in the book and not told anyone about it. The truly wise will
find and listen to and learn from those who have had the &quot;experience&quot; of
having made the mistakes *once each* (or not at all) and learned from it and
moved on.

I am in the final stages of a multi-year *TOTAL* restoration of a 1967
poptop Westfalia camper. I have bored the list way too much with all of the
little aspects of this process but have posted the &quot;experiences&quot; for the
global knowledge gain of everyone. The main thing that I have learned
through the process is that it boils down to research (literature search)
and getting your hands dirty (applied project) and watching for the details,
details, details.
My father was an insurance salesman workaholic who literally freaked every
time the hood was popped on my first car (Ford &quot;Grabber Green&quot; '71 Pinto).
&lt; 8P &gt; He wouldn't give me the time of day until I popped that hood and in
order to prevent me from &quot;fouling things up&quot; he would haunt me like a bad
cold sore until the hood was shut. He always took his car(s) to the mechanic
and had it done. He was simply inexperienced and disinterested in such things.
It wasn't until I got out on my own and *had* to do my own work due to
finances that I started to learn and gather tools. Changing the oil,
*dutifully checking its level!*, and literally cleaning things will get you
familiar with the beast that is carrying you. Look for things that are
obviously dirty, worn, broken, or disconnected. Check the used book stores
for the Bentley, Clymers, and Haynes manuals to guide you. Most everyone
likes the Bentley manuals the best but each may add insight to the common
repair issue that is currently the focus of your time. The Bentley will be
the most expensive but is otherwise *worth its weight in gold* at any given
time. I as yet have not totally rebuilt an engine, completely rebuilt a
transmission, learned to weld, or do bodywork but I have gradually learned
alot- a little at a time. I haven't even scratched the surface yet! Most of
my experience is with the older aircooled VWs. I freely admit to glazing
over when dealing with FI or water cooled but it's the same basic process~
just more details.
Best Wishes-

By the Way: The &quot;Rusty VanBondo&quot; psuedonym thing is a tounge in cheek poking
fun at the supposed &quot;gurus&quot; that we all hear about from general conversation
or the magazines. You know, the know-it-all guys that we could NEVER, ever
dream of becoming. Combine that thought with the typical sorry state of the
less-than-average pre 1968 VW buses. Hang in there!
