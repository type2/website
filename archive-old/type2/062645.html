&gt;Course it may be gone by now anyway, just thought I'd mention
&gt;it anyway.

It wasn't gone the last day of the show, and I don't think anyone was looking seriously at it.  It was a diamond in the rough, tho-

I thought about buying it, but I'm kinda partial to loafs.(Also, I don't have that kind of bread to shell out on another VW)
