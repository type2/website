&gt; I just took my 72 (1700) on a long trip (over 1k miles) with outdoor
&gt; temps ranging from the 50's to the upper 70's and it just had a tune
&gt; up. My question is regarding the oil temp's I had along the way.  
&gt; According to my oil temp gauge, it was consistently into the 265 range

hmmm, I pull over if I ever reach 250, slow down to 55 at 240, but that is
a sump sender, you don't mention what type you have

&gt; but every time I pulled over to look at the engine and see any
&gt; problems I would feel the engine with my hand and grab the dipstick,
&gt; and NEVER did the engine &quot;feel&quot; hot to the touch. I assumed my gauge
&gt; was fouled up but when I put it to boiling water it was dead on.

muir was talking about an upright engine I don't know how accurate the
dipstick test is on a type IV

&gt; Anybody got a clue? Is this normal??

not normal, check timing, how's it running

don't have a clue, not enough data
