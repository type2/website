Subject: RE: porscha  hart transplant

This  list is generally pretty kind to new comers and is accepting of
incorrect spelling.  And, generally ignores poor grammar.  The important
issue for this list is whether or not people are communicating; and that
happens everyday.

You now have let us all know that you know &quot;porscha&quot; is a spelled
incorrectly, but it was spelled phonetically and most will know that the
reference was to Porsche.

If your message was an attempt at humor, I don't see it.  And, it certainly
isn't anyway to greet a new member to the list.  I normally would've sent
something like this in private, but you made it a public statement.

Lighten up and be a bit more polite.

Phil

Lourdcrow_at_aol_dot_com pondered:

&gt;  I have a 1969 transporter and I'm installing a 1976 porscha 914-4 motor.

What the hell is a porcha?  Is that some eye-tal'-yan thing?
