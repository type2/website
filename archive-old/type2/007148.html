List,
please excuse the non-aircooled post, i can't get to the vanagon list (proxy) and i wanted to post this...maybe someone could fwd over to the vanny list for me? Thanks.

This is information on a really nice Vanagon for sale here in Winchester, Ky - about 15 minutes east of Lexington.

Specs:
1987 Wolfsburg edition
2.1L gasoline wasserboxer
4-spd std
189k miles
7-seater
Dark gray/light gray cloth int in great shape.
Alloy wheels
All stock, very few dings in paint, very little rust if any.

Turns out this is a 1-owner.  The lady on the phone said that they (her husband is a doctor and they're from Athens, OH) have always owned busses. She said they have always been religious about maint. and they have all of the records - all the way back to day 1 in 1987 - mostly dealer work.
She said her husband had a reputable VW mechanic go over it and that it is in tip-top shape. Not sure if it has seen engine or tranny rebuilds.

They want $3500.00 .  Said it books for $4875 .

 Nice bus. If i had or could get the money i'd do it.
