Subject: cont'd: E-brake '72 Westy
Message-ID: &lt;01BF1997.24CB42C0_at_castles106_dot_castles_dot_com&gt;

I want to thank all of you who responded with help today - THANKS.  All responses were virtually the same, which indicates that the advice given so freely here is consistent and accurate, and also that I did not describe the problem I am having very well.


1972 Westy, chassis number 232 204 7025.  New rear brake cylinders and pads.

I have the drums off both rear wheels and the e-brake cables disconnected.  I'm looking at the passenger-side rear wheel.  The e-brake cable lever is an articulated two-piece arrangement, held together and also to the rear (on the passenger side wheel) brake shoe by a pin and a horseshoe clip.  It resembles an upside-down &quot;L&quot;, with a pivot point where the two legs meet, which is pinned to the rear brake shoe.  The top leg of the upside-down &quot;L&quot; connects the two brake shoes and is the part that forces the front brake pad into the brake drum (when the e-brake cable is pulled).  The part of the lever that is pinned to the front brake shoe (passenger side again) is a sideways &quot;U&quot; into which a pin fits (also held in place by a horseshoe).  To actuate the spreading of the brake pads, the e-brake cable pulls the e-brake lever, which pivots on the rear brake pad (passenger side) which puts pressure on the front brake shoe and forces it into the brake drum (at least that is the way it looks like it should work to me).

With the parts I have, and the e-brake cables disconnected, I can pull the e-brake lever where the e-brake cable connects, until it stops at the axle hub and it physically cannot be pulled any further.  At this point the  &quot;U&quot; has about a 1/2 inch gap from the pin that would cause the front brake pad to actually move.  

Sheesh, I wish I could make a drawing, talk about being worth ten-thousand words......
                                                                       
Let's see if I can come up with an analogy:

Hmmm, here's the best I can do.  Picture the front fork of a bicycle.  It's an elongated &quot;U&quot; .  You can't ride the bike if the front fork is not properly connected to the front tire.  I have the problem of the front fork being 1/2 &quot; from the front tire axle bolt.  Just does not work.  

The brake shoes are adjusted correctly.  I have bled all the brakes three times (no, I DON't enjoy it....).  If the brake cables were connected to the e-brake lever and adjusted perfectly, the e-brakes would still not work because the e-brake lever just can't move far enough to apply pressure to the brake pads (about 1/2 inch shy).

So I am thinking that I either have too short an e-brake lever or the holes in the brake pads where the e-brake lever is pinned are too far apart.  Since I have bought 1972 brake pads from two sources and they are identical, I am thinking I have the wrong e-brake cable lever.  Can't find one (really need two).  However I am also thinking that perhaps the easier solution would be to just use 1973+ rear brake parts, which are available.

Did any of this make sense?

TIA for any advice.  Maybe I can get a digital photo for tomorrow?
