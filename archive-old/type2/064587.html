Subject: More support for fuel line pressure

I earlier posted a summary of theories about why my van is starting 
poorly.  I was email by a couple people who said that a leaky vacuum line 
could cause rough starts.  But I suspect that bad vacuum would have other 
symptoms.  One of these people said that his van ran poorly for about 5 
minutes after being started, which mine is not doing.  I do not 
understanding the vacuum system very well, but wouldn't that also mess up 
my distributor advance, leading to bad acceleration?

But here is what supports the fuel pressure:  If I go out in the morning 
and start the car, let it run for 2 seconds, kill it, and then try to 
restart it, it will start right up.  In that brief period of operation, 
the engine hardly warms up- it certainly does not register on my 
temperature gauge.  OTOH, today I drove it up to operating temperature 
(300 on the head).  I parked the car for about 2 hours.  When I returned, 
the head temperature was within the scale - about 120 F.  Not real hot, 
but certainly warmer that it is after two seconds of operation.  I try to 
start it, and it took a while.  Conclusion: difficulty starting is not 
exactly correlated to temperature, but instead is a function of length of 
time since it was last operated.  

So if this is the problem, how can I confirm it?  And what might be 
causing it?  Someone mentioned contacts in the air flow sensor.  How can 
I test that?  What about the fuel pump or pressure regulator?  Just some 
ideas.....

Many thanks for all the help!
