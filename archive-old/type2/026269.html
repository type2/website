This subject has got me thinking...  As we are all aware, even level
busses look like they are sagging in the rear.  I think it's an optical
illusion caused by the fact that the front wheel arches clear the wheels
more.
Anyway, I was wondering if anyone knows what the correct distance should
be between the rear spring plates and the upper or lower end stops.
This would allow us to determine whether the rear is sagging or not
without using a spirit level (which is only any use when the ground is
also level).
FYI my spring plates are roughly half way between the stops, I don't
know whether this constitutes a &quot;saggy butt&quot; or not.  Anyone care to
chip in?
