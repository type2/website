Subject: engine ID ? help?

Dear All,

I was told by the PO that my Van had an exchange engine and I am 
trying to work out what year model it is and whether that is true.
The van No is: 2292080102
and the engine No is: CJ019599X
It was first registerd in Germnay in January 1979 as a 2L model.
Am I looking at a 1978 or true 1979 and what is the difference?


THe next question will be which heat exchangers I will need. but that 
is a totally different story. Trying to get hold of  original quality 
ones in Germany or the UK..

thanks
Lukas
