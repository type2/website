Subject: Re: Vanagon price reduction! (Fat Lady sings!)

Sean Bartnik &lt;sbart7kb_at_www.mwc_dot_edu&gt; told of an '82 Vanagon selling (FS) for
a reduced price (little under $2000.00)...

Well I finally took money on &quot;Herpe&quot; the love bus. 
(I started to call it &quot;Herpe&quot; because no one wanted it &lt;the '80 vanagon&gt; and
once we got it we couldn't get rid of it!) ;-)

It *tentatively* sold for a tad more than the figure mentioned but I had to
become the First National Bank of VanBondo to do it. I wrote up a very
specifically worded document stating all conditions as they relate to both
parties. Printed two copies and we both signed each copy. A heavy half
payment makes me think that it will all work out.
