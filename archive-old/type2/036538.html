Subject: disintegrated needle bearing

so I've mannaged to get the engine out and the fly wheel and all to replace 
my needle bearing.  but its almost all disintedgrated.  we're trying to 
chisel it out.  there is about 1 mm left of it and its really stuck in there 
good.  any other ideas how to get it out.  i as thinking of carefully 
drilling it out but was are the ramifications if i drill too much around and 
the new needle bearing fits in loose.   also when i do finally get it out 
should i greese up the new one first before puting it in?

Does anyone know what could cause this to happen to the needle vearing.  Am 
i in need of a new tranny soon???
