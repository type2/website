Subject: '76 &amp; '77 Doors
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hey Folks,
    Some already know my situation: bought a '77 Westy, the passenger door is 
Swiss cheese, eaten up with rust. When I was looking at the is Westy I 
thought no problem, I have a good door off a '76 in my garage. Well, sometime 
in '76 (I'm told)VW changed the hinge attachment to the body from hex head 
screws to bolts, at least that's the only difference I can see. My question 
is: Is it possible to drive that center pin out of the hinge and swap the 
ends of the hinge where it attaches to the body? I'm thinking of heating it 
with a torch and then using a punch to try to drive the pin out. Seems to me 
this should work, unless I'm missing something. If no one knows for sure, I 
will have an answer in a week or two, as I have nothing to lose by trying it 
on the old ('77) door, as it is too far gone to try to save.  Thanks, Jeff S.
