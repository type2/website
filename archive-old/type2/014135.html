Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch cable replacement questions



&gt; I'm in the middle of replacing the clutch cable in my 75 bus. Started
&gt; out as a precautionary measure before I put the engine back in, but I
&gt; found a few things of concern.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. The clevis pin that holds the cable to the pedal assembly and the
&gt; hole in the pedal assembly are both quite worn. I'm afraid either one
&gt; will break soon if not repaired. I intend to weld the hole in the pedal
&gt; assembly closed then redrill it in the proper location and size. The
&gt; problem is I cant find anyone who sells the pin. Any body know where to
&gt; get one or have an extra?

IIRC, I bought one from Bus Depot.  You can also use a (I think) 6mm bolt here.  Be sure that it has a long enough unthreaded part so 
that the pivot isn't bearing on the threaded portion.  I used a nylock nut on it, since you can't tighten it down.  Works dandy.

Put some thick grease on this pivot when reassembling.
