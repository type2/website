&gt; I've seen this stuff, too.  I've considered getting it.  Let me know
&gt; what you find out.  My only thought is that while it will insulate heat
&gt; well, it will not do as much for noise reduction (no felt).

Good point. My profession is a contractor- really an &quot;old house
contractor&quot; and as such, I've had occasion to learn about STC's. 
(Sound Transmission Coefficients).
To make a room in your house sonically isolated from an adjacent room,
there are several things that help.
1. Insulation.
2. Completely sealing any openings between them.
3. Isolating supports so that there is no &quot;sounding board effect&quot;.
4. Increasing the amount of mass between them. (In a house, a
sand-plastered wall is a major step above a lightweight-aggregate-
plastered wall which is a major step above a sheet-rocked wall.)
#4 is where the heavier weight products would really make a difference. 
I'd think any heavier products sandwiched over resilient products would
be the ultimate firewall insulation.
Similarly, another major source of noise has to be the front wheelhouse
area. On my 69 double cab, there is line of sight from the right tire.
Pretty good line of noise, too. Obviously, the first thing for me is to
fix the rust holes, but after that, maybe I'll apply a sandwich of
something there, too.
