Subject: Re: [T2] My weekend with Lurch (CHT gauge)

I suspected that by placing the CHT sender directly downstream from the 
exhaust port that my readings would be a little higher, I just needed 
reassurances from the knowledgeable collective that this is indeed the case.  
Thanks for your input.

I chose this location for its accessibility.  Formerly, I could only get to 
the sender with the engine out and the upper cylinder tin removed.  The old 
sender had broken under there, presumably because the wire had to wind its 
way around and through the tin.  Now, if it should go south (not as likely), 
I can replace it without removing and partially dismantling the engine.

Formerly, temperatures would max out at about 350.  Now, under no load (just 
cruising), it sits at about 375 (which scared me at first).  I have not 
climbed a long grade to see what it'll do, but the music festival this 
weekend is in the mountains of North Carolina, so I'll be able to let you 
know next week sometime.

Thanks,
