&gt; I think this is wrong. 

I KNOW better. But you may ignore my knowledge and think as you will. If
you will run the test I suggested, then you will KNOW as well of
experience, and won't have to guess. 

Alternators are pretty efficient and so the power
&gt;consumed will be pretty close to the power produced.

The electrical power produced by the alturnator is provided by the motor
and is no longer available to turn the wheels. A 90 amp alt fully loaded
takes a lot more horsepower from the engine to turn than a 45 amp alt or
generator under full load. 

 The 45 extra amps
&gt;at 14V (conservative) is only 630W: less than one horsepower (746W).

And one horsepower is how many foot pounds??? Might just need a bit more
tension on that belt and the bearings. Ever try to control a rank horse???
Just one??? How much horsepower is the engine putting out at idle? Maybe 3
or 4. If your sitting idling and demand one more full horsepower for amp
production for that concrete fracturing bass, will the idle drop? How much?
1/4th? 1/3rd? Drivablility problems would you say? 
&gt;
&gt; VW supplied 70A alternators as an option, AFAIK they didn't alter the
&gt;wiring with this modification.

For a stock application the wiring has a good safty margin and the extra
amps within reason is not a problem. However, in the case being considered,
the owner was not stock. He had added several high amp draw wizbangs that
were beyond the stock capacity being provided. Can't compare stock to stock
+100 amps of stereo/CDV/TV/vibrator, ect. That's apples and oranges, which
is why he was having problems.

 Work out how much power draw you've added
&gt;to the electrics and add at least that much power output to the generator
&gt;and you'll be on the right track. 

Exactly as I suggested. Also, if a 70 amp alt is not sufficient, some
serious engineering is involoved in the installation of anything bigger.
Some of these 2 to 4 thousands dollar stereo systems are in large part
paying for the installation of a massive 150 amp alt. That's only medium
difficult to mount on a big truck V-8. Quite a different feat on a T-IV.
That's why I suggested they see the stereo shops 'cause they are the one's
purporting to sell this stuff. If it can be done at any price, they have
the know how. I don't. I suggest some of them don't, but will still sell
you the stereo and warrent it. But they won't talk to you about the battery
probs that come with it. 

Be sure you don't put too much current
&gt;through wiring not designed for it (ie uprate the battery feed and take
&gt;your extra accessory feeds from that bus, not the original fuse panel).
&gt; Remember that fuses protect cables, not equipment. They are there to 
&gt;prevent fires. Fires are bad...

Fuses do protect both equipment and wiring to prevent heat damage of wiring
or to the equipment. A lot of damage can be created without getting
anywhere close to a fire. Fire is just the most extreme form of damage that
can occure if you don't think about the synergy of impacts before you start
to cuttin' and splicin'.

My advice is, if the stock wiring will not handle the load for your
wizbang, leave it off, otherwise, add the cost of the engineering required
to make it work well and install it safely. The true cost of the wizbang is
not known until or if you get it installed with all associated problems
resolved. 

If you want 3 times the amps of the stock system, leave the system stock
and install a GenSet for the wizbang. If it's really good wizbang it will
make enough noise to drown out the noise of the GenSet, or you can pick
tunes that harmonize with the note of the Briggs and Straton.

Know that if such wizbang idles past my place rattling my windows, I only
got a .38, but the guy next door has a .44. Choose your bullet proofing
accordingly.
