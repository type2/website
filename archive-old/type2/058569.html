Subject: Re: Be honest... How fast?

With my '68 w/1600 engine, I generally drove with the pedal to the
metal on the highway -- about 65-68 on the flats. That's why the 1600
engine is simply too small for a bus, unless you really like putting
along at 50, a more reasonable speed (3/4 throttle is best, eh?).
    Finally after several rebuilds, I put together a 1800cc engine w/cam
and roller bearing/fully counterweighted crank, and still drove it
around 70, but the engine lasted one heck of a lot longer. 
   With my '73 w/'81 2.0 engine, I generally drive about 75 where I can
get away with it - or at least 70 otherwise. I really don't feel any
need for more power with the stock 2.0 FI engine.
