Subject: Re: [T2]  Waterbed (was Now I've Heard It All!)

Apart from bursting, the other thing about not driving with =

it would be its effect on weight distribution. As a floating =

mass it would shift forward as you brake increasing the =

likelyhood of lockup, and it would probably effect your =

cornering as well.

Thanks,

&gt;I too have entertained the thought of puttin=
g in a waterbed. =

I sleep on one
&gt;at home and never feel comfy in my bus like I do at hom=
e.
&gt;
&gt;Some thoughts are taking a super single matress and making a =

full cabinet
&gt;from the upper engine hatch out to where the bed would en=
d =

for it to rest
&gt;on. You would probably also have to make some sort of 
retaining frame around
&gt;the whole thing to keep the mattress in place a=
nd have a =

good liner.
&gt;
&gt;You would lose passenger seating and the bed could only=
 be =

filled at the
&gt;campsite as I imagine it would be too heavy to drive wit=
h =

that much water.
&gt;Plus if for any reason it burst you would have a bad =
=

situation. Might even
&gt;have to remove the cabinet in most buses.
&gt;
&gt;I=
 am really thinking of doing this down the road though. If =

anyone has any
&gt;insights they are welcome. Maybe some of you have put i=
n an =

air mattress and
&gt;can say if it works good or not.
&gt;
&gt;Of course I kno=
w this is an impractical modification.

&gt; Here's the kicker and she swears it's true. It had a

ATERBED in the back!

&gt;&gt; That is just too cool.
