Subject: Tinted windscreens in UK?

U.K. Listmembers,

I am preparing a  So. Calif. '71 bus for shipment to the UK for use
during the summer and possible sale after the summer.  I am replacing
the windscreen and rubber.  Any thoughts on whether I should put in
tinted glass or not?  Here one definitely would.  Is tinted glass
thought to be a disadvantage there?  On another matter, anyone going to
Minehead in July?  Thanks in advance, cheers,

Jim Miller
