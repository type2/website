Subject: 77 Transporter/Adventure-Wagen for sale in NH, $2900
Mime-Version: 1.0

With much regret, I need to sell my bus!  $2900 is a steal for the following:

I converted my 1977 Transporter into a camper with a pop-top Adventure
Wagen kit, a propane stove and sink and the clean interior of a 73
Westphalia.  The rebuilt 1800 cc motor has 20,000 miles on it and a Weber
carburetor for easy maintenance and plenty of power.  This bus comes with 4
all season radials used one summer and four studded snow tires, used one
winter, all on VW rims.  The color is white with an orange sliding door
(the original had some rust).  This rot-free Wyoming bus took me to Alaska
and back and it could take you there as well.

I'm moving back to Wyoming in February and sadly can't take it with me.  
Call Adam at 603 835 5500 or write back to me at this address to arrange a
test drive.
