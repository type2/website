Hi, I'm having trouble with the alternator on my '75 bus. Im not really
sure if the problem lies in the alternator, voltage regulator, or both. I
bought this converted trasporter from the nicest man i have ever met for
$350 in non-running condition. I got it running but it has a few *minor*
issues. When I hook up a good battery, the alternator on the dash lights
up, this is without a key and the ignition off. When I start the engine,
the light is dim at first and becomes brigter as the engine runs, and
lights more when i rev it up. As a test, I left the battery hooked up over
night, with the dash alternator light still on. When i came back, the
battery was stone dead. I'm pretty sure that the alternator is toast,
because the previous owner said that someone tried to jump the bus with
the jumpers backwards. When i [correctly] jumped the car it ran for a
while and then stalled.....i tihnk the distributer was sparking right off
the battery, because right before it would stall, revving it have it  a
litte more life, possibly the few amps that the alternator had left(?). My
question is: why was the battery dead when i left it overnight? the only
known appliance on was the battery light (which may be trying to tell me
there is some oteher  trouble). could this be a short somewhere or
what? could this also explain why the brake lights and back up lights
aren't working? I apprecate any help you can give..thanks in advance

Eddie Goodwin
