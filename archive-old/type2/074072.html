Subject: Re: [T2] 15&quot; wheels and Fat Boy Muffler

Mark:

Most alloy wheels for street cars don't weigh much less than stock steel wheels, in fact, in many cases, they weigh more than the stock steel wheels.  This is because the DOT has safety standards for alloy wheels that can only be met by putting lots of metal in the high-stress areas of wheels.  The only way you're going to get light weight wheels is to buy true racing wheels, many of which are made of magnesium or advanced aluminum alloys.  As you can guess, they are extremely cost prohibitive, as well as illegal for street use.  I ran alloys on my Datsun because I wanted 16&quot; wheels, and at the time, the only way I could do that was to use wheel adapters and Chevy-sized wheels.  I wanted the better cornering that low-profile tires would give my car, and the extra weight of the adapters was a good trade-off in my opinion.

&gt;the weight of wheel adapters negate the benefits of the lighter alloy wheels.?
