Subject: RE: [T2] A Bay Window, a Lawyer, and the Need for Weed

Be sure and take your AARP card if you were around to have done this before.  Might even schedule a nap in there somewhere.   :)  Cheers....KR

But, you got to love Americana!

I think this afternoon I'll drive my bus around getting high with my free
