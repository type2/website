Subject: windshield

Thanks to all for the advice on how to pull my windshield. Using a sharp
object to cut away the seal is something I should have thought of, guess I'm
getting old.
Speaking of seals, on to lame question #2. I'll be going through and
replacing the vast majority of the window/door seals. Once the metal area is
free of rust, primered and clean, which is preferred: Rubber cement or an
RTV of some sort? I would guess RTV, but with so many on the market is there
a specific type (silicone?) or manufacturer?
I'll be having a pro do the windshield so I'm not concerned there.

Thanks in advance,

Pete
