Subject: Spark plug hole rethreading

Hi

One of my spark plug popped out the other day. It's a typeIV engine (2 Ltr.) 
where it's extremely hard to even see the hole in the cylinder head. I 
bought a new spark plug but it still came out. Not imediately but when I 
started second time. Sooo I guess my threads are broken.. Does anyone have a 
nice way to fix this problem? I've got a used spare cylinder head. Is this 
the best option?
Thanks in advance.

Regards Ole-Kristian (-75 mod type2)
