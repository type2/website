Not to lead you astray, but my buddy Dalton has a regular house a/c
installed in his Riviera. It just fit in the middle window. He just plugs it
in when he gets to the camp site. He showed it to us a couple of weekends
ago and when he opened the door whoo hoo!!  it was cold in there. Plus you
only have to pay the 10 bucks a night for camping and you can run your a/c
all weekend!! I noticed Wal dffdsaffsad had them for 125 spanking new.
My dad gave me one that fits inside my front door window. It is small enough
to be portable. I put in the window and strapped  it down. It cools the
whole bus down to about 60 degrees in an hour. When I am done using it I can
just put it in the storage building until next trip. Of course if you want
a/c all the time this won't work without your generator, which looks
portable too!!

&gt; I started wondering what that box was thats on top of all RVs. Once i
&gt; found out it was AC i thought, why can't i have one of those for my
&gt; 77 Riviera camper. Turns out they run on A/C so you'll need a generator
&gt; too, but they do have optional heat too. They are pricy ~ $600 for unit
&gt; plus ~ $400 for a generator, but can you put a price on comfort. And they
&gt; even worked with the motor stopped.
&gt;
&gt; I was wondering if any has tried this. If my Riviera pop top could hold
&gt; 75lbs, or if i could remove the front 'glass part and put it there, right
&gt; above the front seats. And make some kind of rear bumper mount for the
&gt; generator.
&gt;
&gt; this is the two products i thought would work good, there are lots others:
&gt;
&gt; this AC unit
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; and this generator
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; thanks for the input:
