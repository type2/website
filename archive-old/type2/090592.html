&gt; I just got a CV boot kit from BusDepot.  It's Meistersatz and I'm wondering

&gt; This is an image of the Febi and Lobro kits and they both have two extra
&gt; clips for the end of the boot.
&gt;
&gt; Why is my kit missing these two pieces?

My Meisterwhatever kits had the little crimp clamps.  Unfortunately the
boots didn't last all that long once on.  I think that quality varies
widely.

A lot of folks don't use clamps on the axle end.  I've never seen this
part of the boot leak at all, clamps or no.
