Subject: Speedomoter wierdness

Hi all:

Recently the speedometer in my Westy has started to act funky.  From a dead
stop the needle doesn't move until the vehicle's going about 35 mph at which
time the needle jumps up to that speed.  Once it's &quot;going&quot; you can slow way
down and the needle tracks the slower speed OK.  The odometer is running
even if the needle isn't registering any speed so I'm sure it's not a cable
problem.

Anybody know what's going on here?  Anything I can fix myself?

TIA.
