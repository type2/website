Subject: Engine hiccupping

Hi Folks
I've got a hiccuping engine question:
Here's the context.  2 months ago I bought a '78 bus with a 2000 cc FI
engine. I got it inspected and on the road a week ago and have been doing
errands around town without problem. Per advice from a mechanic who looked
it over, I ran a bottle of fuel system cleaner (Penzoil) with the last tank
of gas. I took it 40 miles to work and back (all highway) yesterday, no
problem. Today I needed to drive it to work again, so last night I refueled
the nearly empty tank and dumped another bottle of fuel cleaner in. This
morning, after about 20 minutes, it started hiccupping intermittently - once
every few minutes. Obviously noticeable, but not jerky. Just a quick
skip-a-beat. By the end of the ride it was happening more frequently.
There's one intersection 1/2 mile before work where I had to stop, but I
don't remember it happening through 1st or 2nd gear.

I'm hoping it's just the fuel filter. Is there a more likely candidate I
should start with? I'm wondering if my 2 doses of fuel cleaner and heavy
driving two days in a row have released a bunch of junk and clogged the fuel
filter. 

Thanks
Mat
