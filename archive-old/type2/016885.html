Volks:
It's that time of the year when most people get a
little misty-eyed at the thought of all the blessings
that have come their way; I think of this list and the
people on it (some of whom I have met- most of whom I
haven't) who have passed along their kind words, their
advice, their spare parts...to list everyone who's made
a meaningful contribution not only in my VW life, but
also in my life in general would be too long...
I was driving home from Brooks's house after
babysitting for Sammy last night (and breaking an
accelerator cable as I was leaving...it was a bit of a
pain in the ass at midnight, but when it's 5 degrees F
outside breaking in a driveway with a heated garage and
a helpful brother in law is more than could reasonably
be hoped for) and I realized this: driving down the
road in my bus with my daughter, exactly 13 years to
the night I got into a car in a snowstorm in New
Hampshire and drove her until she fell asleep- it was
her second night home from the hospital, and she had
colic...and here we were again...in Indiana, in the
darkness of a new moon, driving down highway 37 in an
old bus, in the silence of not needing to talk which
come from being with the right people in the right
place, holding hands and smiling;
My favorite bus moments of the year (besides that one):
1. Brooks and I starting the engine at 2am after 14
hours in Ted Finesman's parking lot in Cincinatti.
2. Driving with Henry de Kuyper (VW Trends editor) on
the bus tour with my son in the backseat at BBTA-
crossing the Lewis and Clark Bridge with busses ahead
for miles.
3. Talking philosophy with Charlie and Brian Wittling
very late at night.
4. Finding Ted at the other end of the phone when my
bus's engine blew up in Cincinatti.
5. The sound that my brand new engine makes.
And now, if you will indulge me, because it's almost
Friday, because it IS Christmas eve:

In the beginning was the word, and word was with God,
and the word was God.
In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness
comprehended it not.
He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the
world knew him not.
He came unto his own, and his own received him not.
But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become
the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:
Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh,
nor of the will of man, but of God.
And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we
beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the
Father,) full of grace and truth. (from the Gospel of John)

Merry Christmas, Happy Hannukah, and the may the
blessings of the winter solstice be with all of you;
may each of you find lux in tenebris lucet (light
shining in the darkness).

Dan
