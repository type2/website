&gt; This afternoon I swapped the throttle body, AFM, ECU and wiring harness

&gt; The cause of the high fuel pressure is definitely a vacuum leak, as I
&gt; have confirmed that the rubber gaskets between the plenum and the
&gt; intake runners are sucking air. When I spray quickstart anywhere near

yup those buggers are a bear to get on right. probably crimped at the
bottom.  slide em further onto the good side, straighten em up and slide
em back, much easier said than done

&gt; I had resisted turning the sunroof into a parts bus, but I can't keep
&gt; the westfakia off the road forever. Since I have enough known-good
&gt; parts to build a megasquirt system, this is probably what I will do for
&gt; the sunroof bus. Megasquirt FI will allow me to ditch a 25-year-old
&gt; wiring harness, AFM, ECU, Cold start and Aux Air valve. Once it's
&gt; proven to work on the sunroof (ie, at least a full season)  I will see
&gt; about putting one on the westfakia as well.

well keep me in mind for the Auto tranny parts.


good luck, wish I were going somewhere  this weekend

Bob
