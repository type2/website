Subject: Re: [T2] Anonymous threatening letters left on my bus...

From: &quot;David Burton&quot; &lt;david_a_burton_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt;
&gt; ... I'm curious to see what they do next...

I've had a few neighbors who went too far in protesting various things that
their neighbors were prone to do on occasion.  I hope this isn't the case
with your bus.  Baseball bats, rocks and keys leave marks!

I agree with the others who have mentioned keeping an eye on your bus.  Be a
good neighbor, but be a wise one, too.

Hope it all works out.
