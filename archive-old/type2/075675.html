Subject: Re: [T2] Parcel Tray on CAD

&gt;I'm one of those CAD guys on this list who'd like to start working on this
library concept. I'd also like a parcel tray.


I'm one one those CAD guys, too.  The engine dolly plan in the archive is
done on CAD, and I've thought it would be a good idea to at least post it as
a .pdf file, so people could download that and print out a nice crisp
version at home to use.  I'm leary of putting the original CAD file out
there, as Chris Huff wrote me this dandy CYA (ha!  the construction folks
out there know that one) paragraph that will keep me in my own house in case
somebody tips the engine over on their seeing eye dog, and I don't really
want that paragraph to disappear and leave me vulnerable.  I admit it, the
lawyers win on this one.

But I'm all for getting the trays, racks, beds, etc. that we busers make for
ourselves out there for others to use.  I could draw up my battery tray
template, for example.

What's the collective wisdom?
