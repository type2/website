Subject: Vanagon brakes

on the rear of a bay came up again a couple of weeks ago. I had mentioned how cheap and easy it was to do and 
was reminded that the east coast suffers from something that, here in Fresno Calif, we call a color in a box 
of crayons:  rust.

Unless you find very nice used parts, this change-over will be expensive. OEveedub sells new Vanagon rear 
backing plates but OUCH!!! they are $95.10 EACH........

With the cost of new wheel cylinders, shoes, and drums; this is a pricey update to self-adjusting rear 
brakes..... WAY more than the $50 it cost me in nice used parts...
