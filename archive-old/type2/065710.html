Subject: olfactory question, plus Friday stuff

Greetings, all:

On Tuesday 8 Oct 96, Eric Rainey &lt;rainey_at_email.unc_dot_edu&gt; asked:

&gt; Finally of all, what the hell is that smell?  You surely know the smell
&gt; I mean.  I have smelled it no other place than VWs.  Air cooled VWs.  I
&gt; smelled it in my parent's old squareback.  I smell it in my bus.  It's 
&gt; not altogether unpleasant, when I smell it it makes me keenly aware 
&gt; that I'm driving my bus, one of my favorite things to do. 

How about it.  I finally got the heater working pretty well [inline fan
helps] on my bus, but it does carry fumes into the cabin--my untutored
nose can't tell if it's just warm-engine fumes or if it's exhaust fumes
leaking in, though whatever-it-is is pretty strong. Short of hanging a
canary in a cage from the rear view mirror, how can I tell? The air tube
connections seem right and tight.  I'd hate to have to risk asphyxiation
everytime I wanted to defrost the windshield.  And if it is exhaust fumes,
where does that leave me? Are the heat exchangers the likely culprits? 

Thanks in advance.

Now to Friday stuff.  These are from the Oracle Service Humor Archives

     45 year-old Amy Brasher was arrested in San Antonio, Texas, after a 
     mechanic reported to police that 18 packages of marijuana were packed 
     in the engine compartment of the car which she had brought to the
     mechanic for an oil change. According to the police, Brasher later 
     said that she didn't realize that the mechanic would have to raise the 
     hood to change the oil.
     
     Dave so-and-so of Anniston, Alabama, was injured recently after he 
     attempted to replace a tubelike fuse in his Chevy pickup with a 
     22-caliber rifle bullet (used because it was a perfect fit). However, 
     when electricity heated the bullet, it wet off and shot him in the 
     knee.

Darwin would know what to say about Amy and Dave.
