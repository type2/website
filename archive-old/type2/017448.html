Subject: Looking for 'bell housing'

I understand that the rear section of the later model type II
transmission
comes off the trans.  I am looking for one of these so I can make an
engine stand that I can start the engine on.
 I also understand that there were early and late models
and that the early model could be used with type I engines.

Comments or suggestions on finding the part would be appreciated.

Thanks
Dennis Farr
