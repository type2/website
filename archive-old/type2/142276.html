Subject: RE: [T2] Engine cover plates

Thanks for the info. I think it is part #20, but I need to look again. I
remember when I changed the carbs that their was a big rusted hole directly
behind where the intake manifold attaches to the head. I will take a pic soon
and then get with Karl about getting the correct piece. I am trying to get all
the cooling tin I need, but obviously looking through the microfiche is not my
thing :)
