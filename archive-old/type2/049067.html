Subject: RE: [T2] Replacing Insides of Seat &amp; Seat Back in '78 Westfalia Deluxe

List,

My mileage, as they say, varied.  I bought my 77 Westy Deluxe from Ron in 97 
and got his foam seat padding at the same time.  They are indeed a close fit 
over the seat frames and are a good product overall, however, they are, in 
my opinion, too much padding for the seat covers to go over.  I spent a lot 
of time de-rusting and painting my seat frames and carefully washing my seat 
covers, which came out perfect looking (and if you have only ever seen 20 
year old bus seats, you have no idea how bright this plaid used to be).  The 
bottom cover went on with some difficulty and was VERY tight and over 
stuffed feeling.  The top padding I covered with a plastic bag and warmed 
the cover up in the clothes dryer.  When I tried to carefully persuade the 
cover over the frame and padding, my very perfect seat cover ripped right up 
the back from the left rear corner (insert primal scream).  The fit was so 
tight it would NOT have gone on without ripping.  I now have prelude seats 
in my bus (insert big **SIGH**).

My advise:  Think of what a smart person and good citizen you are for 
driving a beautiful bus instead of paying the car payment for a real car and 
give your bus the love it deserves, buy her (he, it?) parts that are as 
close to original as you can find, don't cut corners and your bus will treat 
you just as well.  If you believe in karma, also tell your bus how great it 
is...

&gt;You can go with original-style &quot;horsehair&quot; padding or foam rubber. The
&gt;horsehair padding will eventually disintegrate and fall out like your
&gt;original did. The foam rubber will eventually flatten a bit but will not
&gt;fall out. Neither is likely to occur for many years.  I personally used the
&gt;foam rubber in my '77 Westy, and was very happy with the results (still
&gt;looked/felt like new when I sold the bus 2-1/2 years later), but I'm sure
&gt;others prefer the horsehair.  All foam rubber padding is not the same; some
&gt;VW vendors sell nearly flat pieces of cut foam that is more generic in fit,
&gt;while others (such as myself) sell ones that more closely match the 
&gt;original
&gt;seat contour.
