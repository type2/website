Subject: Ignition Switch

Good day folks.  I need some advice.  My ign. switch just stopped
working on the '73 Transporter.
The VIN  is 2322158772.  Before removing the switch, I figured I should
get a key cut from the
VIN.  Is that the next step or is there something I could do to make
life any easier?

I also remember at various times people would post their VIN and would
recieve a bunch of info about their vehicle at time of original
purchase.   Is that info still available and would that person be into
giving me the info as well?

Thanks in Advance.
