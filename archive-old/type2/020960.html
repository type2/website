I bought my first 1971 in 1978 and everything was original.  The was no way you
could open the hatch from the inside and there was no tug knob.  I saw several
71's in junkyards twenty years ago and never have I seen one with a tug knob that
unlocked the hatch.  The only Westfalia I saw with an original equipment lever for
opening the hatch from the inside was my in-laws 1970.  The wood panel was
specially cut to expose the lever on the lock.

What I did was make a small cut in the wood cover and attach a rod to a lever on
the latch that could be used to unlock the hatch.

&gt; Mr. RNeithammer's explanation of the inner workings of the 71 sliding door
&gt; was impressive and good reading!

&gt; On the question of missing latch parts:
&gt;
&gt; Others in this thread have suggested the lever to unlock the hatch from inside
&gt; exists but is hidden by the paneling. I suspect the original tug knob was a
&gt; plastic &quot;T&quot; affair which was easily
&gt; broken and that restorations by POH-folk merely covered the access.
&gt;
&gt; I could be wrong, but suspect it you remove the paneling you will see all
&gt; you need to pop the hatch from inside--sans pretty plastic thingy.
