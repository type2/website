Subject: Re: [T2] Ring Removal Tool

Don,

It's not so much the glass beads may cause any problem's--
Why would you want to remove any material ( as little as it may be )
from the surface area of the piston?

What, are you going to have them knurled after you bead blast them to
tighten up the piston to cylinder wall clearance?

Drop them into a can of Hydro Seal---and rinse them off---no  material
loss--

Not a bad idea---just not the best solution.

Later,

TK

 
I thought that bead blasting (as opposed to sand blasting) wasn't risky?
The beads are larger and smoother... Easier to identify and remove from
passages and such... (I've only used sand in my rig so am looking for
clarification.)
