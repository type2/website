&gt; Not True! a catalytic converter is a chamber of catalyst ( as the name implies)

&gt; correct me if im wrong on the nox and sox or have it backward with the unburned
&gt; fuel, i am not an engineer/chemist)  If you don't care about smog and air
&gt; pollution don't worry about it, but if you do the cat is integral to the
&gt; emissions system. (leaving my personal opinion out to avoid flames from a
&gt; certain subset of listees ... can't teach old dogs new tricks)
&gt; Also reduced back pressure can lean out the mixture so readjusting is a good

&gt; is that it is more likely an egr hookup, at least that make more intuitive sense
&gt; to me.

Jamie,
I agree with you on all 3 points.
1. He was referring to an EGR hookup.
2. egr is a good idea (but finding a functional filter IS a problem)
3. Cats are a good idea. (even if not subject to testing like here in Iowa). If for
no other reason than it quiets the damn noise. (other reasons, too, for those of us
that breathe.)
