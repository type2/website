Subject: Re: [T2] 71 Blown Engine?!?!?

You weren't towing a Beetle were you? Just kidding - earlier post today... 

I have had the plug fall out of my motorcycle before and stopped the engine just as the oil light come on. 

We tortured a Fiat once and it lasted quite a while with a big hole in the oil filter. A minute or so, no oil. No idea how good or bad it would have been had we stopped the engine and fixed the oil leak. 

Fix the leak, fill it up and give it a try. 

Chris
