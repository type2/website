It was not my intent to &quot;berate&quot; anyone. My intent was to point out
how this misfortune can be eliminated from future reoccurance.

Also, someone suggested that he had no way of knowing that there could
be a problem in a 50 mile drive. I suggest he had no way of knowing that
he wouldn't have a problem, except, in either case, by prior inspection.

Thanks for the feedback, keep it coming.
