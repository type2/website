&gt;&gt;also, do they make these for the front too?&lt;&lt;

&gt; i've never heard of any. i can't think how a coil spring would work with
&gt; the stock suspension in the front anyway.


A lot of off-road guys use them to help raise their buses &amp; give them tougher suspension.

The problem is, of course, that the coil-over takes up a lot of the strain that is normally taken by the torsion bars &amp; as such puts much more load on the shock mounts which are designed to absorb shock, not take the weight of the entire bus.

If all you're doing with the bus is doing a lot of on-road driving, well fine, but if you are raising the bus for plenty of bouncy off-road action it's a bad move unless the suspension is raised mainly by a adjustable front beam to begin with.

Coil-overs should be an addition to a raised vehicle, not the means to raise it.

It just depends on what you're using them for.
