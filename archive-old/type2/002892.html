Hi John

Here's my 2 cents...
Warning, looong append.

I put the following into our 73 Westy (Lily) about 2 weeks
and 600 miles ago:
- 78 type 4 engine (hydraulic lifters)
- 76 fuel injection (minus the charcoal vent canister)
- 73-74 heater boxes
- Empi extractor exhaust
- 73 flywheel and 210mm clutch/pressure plate
- 73 starter

Things to think about:
- If you are willing to learn about fuel injection, it beats
 carburetors hands down IMHO (no flames please)
 Starting at 30 below zero is absolutely no problem,
 and the mileage is great (fuel injection is more
 fuel and emission efficient than carbs), and
 maintaining 65MPH on the interstate is a breeze.
 I have had a 71 with a dual port 1600,
 a 73 with the 1700cc carbureted type 4,
 and a 76 with fuel injection, and much prefer the
 2000cc fuel injected engine.

- The 73 never came with fuel injection...
- So that means the following.
- You are going to need everything from the donor
  bus associated with the fuel injection.
  This includes the obvious pieces on the engine as well
   as the not so obvious (to some folks)
- You need the fuel pump and its harness
- You also need to cut the air box mounting bracket from
  a donor bus and bolt or weld in into your bus.
  In my case I cut enough either side of the bracket to
  give me tabs to run bolts through.
- Don't forget the double relay, resistor pack, and computer.
- One more thing, you need the donor bus gas tank, or
   see below for another solution.

Installation:
- Once the old engine is out...
- I started with all the peripherals for the &quot;new&quot; engine.
- First I measured the location for the computer
  from the donor bus, got out the sazall and
  cut the hole. Next I drilled two holes for the
  screws used to secure the computer in place.
  Got two J-clip nuts from the local hardware store
  and installed those so that I sort of have threads.
  You could also use sheet metal screws instead.
- Had to add a hole, and double nutted bolt to
  serve as the battery ground cable connection
  (same location as donor bus)
- Pulled the firewall panel to swap gas tanks
  (fuel injection has a supply and return connection
  and the carb motor has a supply only)
  Before installing the donor tank I sandblasted the
  gas line connections, and found them to be
  less than trustworthy.  Now what !
  OK, reinstall 73 tank, use bottom supply takeoff
  for supply, and I used the drivers side vent takeoff
  on top of the tank for the return from the pressure regulator.
  The vent on the passengers side  (which goes up
   around, and then down the drivers side , I added flexible
   tubing to and exited it near the outermost end of the
   rear bumper. You could use the passengers side vent takeoff,
   but I figure I am better to keep the cavitation caused by the
   return line as far away as possible from the supply.
- Removed the fuel pump from the engine tin, and mounted it
  just below the filler pipe access cover. This made routing the return
  line to the tank a breeze.
- Installed the firewall panel from the donor bus as it has a bracket for
the
  decel valve). You could also add your own L bracket.
- Drilled a hole (measure donor bus) for the
  fuel pump to double relay harness, ran the wires to the
  fuel pump and starter solenoid. The deal here is that
  when you turn the ignition key, the fuel pump is turned on
  until either you release the key or the engine starts.
- Mounted the double relay and resistor pack.
- Next I measured the location for the fuel pump
  and mounted that.
- Installed fuel filter and hoses.
- OK, slide the engine in
- I stupidly forgot about not being able to use the 228mm clutch
  setup, pulled the engine back out and used the 73 210mm setup.
- OK, now the engine is in
- Connected the throttle cable, after moving it to the right...
- Connected the wiring for the double relay and resistor pack
- Connected the wires to the coil
- Connected the Fuel Lines
- Temporarily installed the air flow meter, hose and Air box
  Got a good comfortable place for the air box bracket, marked it
  and took the air flow meter, etc, back out.
- Mounted the air box bracket.
- Reinstalled the air flow meter, etc.
- Connected the harness to the computer.
- Connected the harness to the air flow meter
- Mounted the decel valve on the firewall panel.
- Sanity checked everything. The last thing you
  want is a fire.
- Put gas in the tank
- Changed oil and filter.
- Connected the battery
- Turned the key, engine cranks but nothing, ...bummer.
- OK get the ether, and give her a shot
- Turned the key, it runs for a few seconds. So, I have spark but
   no fuel. Crawl under the bus and reverse the two
   fuel pump wires.
- Turn the key, and it fires up and purrs.
- That was about 600 miles ago, and yes it was worth it.

Remember winter is coming. If you live in the rust belt you will
need to prep your bus. Undercoat, oil slider, etc.
