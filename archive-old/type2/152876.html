&gt; I know this has come up in the past, but I didn't have luck with the 
&gt; archives.
&gt; 
&gt; I got a type 3 engine and want to convert it to a type 1 setup. What 
&gt; parts/mods do I need?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm working on finding the following:
&gt; All cooling tin (how many pieces are there exactly on a type 1? top 2 
&gt; covers, shroud, back, front, oil cooler tin,  2 cool tins, 2 heater box 
&gt; cover plates.. what else?)
&gt; fan
&gt; oil cooler
&gt; Manifolds/carb (original carbs are junk)
&gt; alternator stand/alternator
&gt; pulleys
&gt; oil filler assembly
&gt; heater boxes
&gt; muffler
&gt; 
&gt; I'll have to block off the type 3 style oil filler tube hole in the 
&gt; case. It looks like the original fuel pump should work...
&gt; what else am i missing?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks

Hello Eddie   First you will need the adapter that turns the oil filler hole 
into a dipstick hole  empi, bugpack  CB, scat make these    I have all the 
other stuff you need where are you located  I am in vIRGINIA    You can use the 
type 3 oil cooler which is a little better than thetype 1  also doing that will 
give you an oil switch otherwise you will have to drill and tap the case for 
one or you will have to cut a slot for the oil switch to show thur the fan 
housing. . The other difference is the oil cooler stud but that isnt a problem   
later and have fun  Mark Dearing
