Subject: engine heat problem?
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hi Volks!
    Here's my problem. Sometimes I take my '70 camper for drives over 30 min. long. I shut her off and leave her. when I try to restart her again she won't turn over. I have to leave her sitting there for at least an hour before she will start.My guess is that the engine is too hot.When I run it for a short time it starts up again fine. My other clue is that the last owner neglected her.The engine is light blue and the air cleaner is really small and chrome. Even worse,the engine is sort of dirty and has gaps in the compartment from someone's carelessy swapping the engine.Is this it? If so,how can I make her run right? Thanks for any help!
