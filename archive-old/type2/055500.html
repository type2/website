Subject: RE: side window installation--help!

&gt;a hair of throwing a brick through the window, anybody care to let
&gt;me in on the secret of installing the side rear windows on a
&gt;baywindow westy? The one without the vent window, on the
&gt;passenger side. No amount of pushing, grunting, swearing will
&gt;get this thing in. I've got it about 95% in, but the window seems to
&gt;be bowed out in the middle, like the seal is too thick or something.

I may be off base here, but I remember a similar thread about a year
ago.  If I remember right, the secret (other than a lot of sweat and
cussing) is that you must remove the metal cover that goes over the
sliding door track.  If you've already done this to no avail, then may
the gods be with you in your endeavor.
