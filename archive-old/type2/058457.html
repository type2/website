Friends--

Happiness for you.  We have figured all the heating answers for you in our
1976 van!

I can post pictures of all improvements, etc., for those who are visual
learners, (let me know), in the mean time, here's how to have heat in your
loaf that gets hot in a minute, and keeps you comfy down to 0 F... no kidding.

During a total overhaul/rebuild last fall we installed new heater boxes, riser
tubes, and flappers.  Also, we wrapped the exhaust extractors/afterburner J-
tubes with a product called Race-Tec.  It is a Fiberglass web belt-like
material, you moisten, then wrap spiral around the exhaust.  It forms an
insulating chrysalis around the exhaust, holding in the heat until it reaches
the heat exchangers.  It works so well you can actually grab the exhaust after
coming off the highway without getting burned!  We also wrapped the heat riser
tubes, and part of the flappers with the same product.

Next we inserted all original heater ductwork into Heavy mylar/fiberglass
household ducting, insulated to R-4.3.  This is no small task, as there is
about 25 feet of ducting/valves in the van.  We created the active
recirculation ducting you speak of (picks up warm air from inside van).  Now,
the original electric blower above the motor sucks air through an insulated
duct that runs from a 4.5&quot; hole directly behind the spare tire well in the
rear of the motor box.  The motor cooling fan still sucks in its proportion of
fresh air, thus ensuring complete air change, as designed.  Additionally, we
added two 300+ cfm inline blowers, which we purchased through JC Whitney of
Illinois, USA. 

One of the blowers is a &quot;squirrel cage&quot; type, and is mounted under the floor,
inline in the ducting, and blows out the rearmost floor vent.  The other is a
common 300 cfm Bilge blower, mounted in line in the ducting directly below the
vertical defrost/floor tube in the front of the van. 

Both fans have independant relays/fuses/switches, all of which are tied into
the line that serves the rear heater blower.  Thus, you cannot &quot;accidentally
leave on a fan,&quot; and the fans will only come on when the heat is meat to be on
FULL.  With this set up, you can control the amount of heat and velocity of
air to very fine limits.

Additionally, the interior panels were removed, all interior walls were double
undercoated with &quot;Kool Patch&quot; (see bleow), then insulated with R-13 insulation
and overwrapped with 3-mil moisture barrier.  All floors were double
undercoated with &quot;Kool Patch&quot; (an asphalt/rubber/fiberglass emulsion used for
roofing repairs), and the covered with a JC Whitney product called &quot;Sound and
Heat Barrier Insulation Used by NASA.&quot;  It is a non-woven, 1/2&quot; thick felt
with two thin layers of aluminum and fiberglass mesh on one side.  Quite
effective.  All &quot;voids&quot; in the body were filled with polyurethane expansion
foam sealant.  The interior was reupholstered, and reinstalled.

The result?  Modern, effective heat.  My lovely wife and I took the van cross
country last year from October through the 1st of December.  During the
Northern leg of our journey we got stuck in an early blizzard between
Badlands, South Dakota and Yellowstone, Wyoming.  Temps dropped to near 0.  We
were plenty comfy, literally in shirtsleeves.  No condensation on the windows,
no cold noses. 

I hope this helps. If you have any questions, let me know. For those who are
stateside, YES, this is the van that is for sale. First $4,300 takes it. It's
brand new from end to end, inside &amp; out. No rust, and comes with TONS of
camping stuff.

Lemme know if you want pictures,
