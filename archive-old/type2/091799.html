Let me rephrase my original post with the word &quot;meaningful&quot; to go with =
&quot;comparison&quot; as I'm sure that's the kind of information we would all be =
interested in. I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a purist when it =
comes to the little aircooled wonder that powers our vehicle and firmly =
beleive that 50+ years after it's original design that it could benefit =
from some of the 21st century technology we now have at our disposal. =
However, I would like to see proven results before committing any of =
them to my once only &quot;dream&quot; engine, thus the reason for asking the =
question.

To be meaningful, these comparisons need to be made with the fans =

I doubt that it makes much difference.
