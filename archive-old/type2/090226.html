Subject: Re: [T2] Regarding the &quot;new&quot; microbus...

Let us look on the bright side, shall we?

The market for the real thing (what we have and especially what our
colleagues at vintagebus have) probably consists of two camps: the folks
like us who buy busses, fix them, and keep them running; and other folks
who buy busses and pay other people to fix them and keep them running. I
don't know how many of those &quot;other folks&quot; there are, but they will be
drawn to the new microbus and that will leave more for folks like us to
work with. (It might not be so good for the mechanics, though). In the
long run, siphoning away the big spenders will help to keep prices low for
us. 

Even so, there is much to be said for authenticity, and in the long run
there should be, shall we say, renewed respect for our busses. So even
though I will never own one of the new microbusses (given a choice, I
would take a Eurovan), I think it's a good thing that VW is doing this.
