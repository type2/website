Subject: new parts busses

List:
Through a recent barter with a salvage yard, I have acquired salvage
rights to  3 busses and a bug. The busses are terminal cases and partly
picked over already. Furthermore, because of flooding in July, some
pieces have been under water.
Here are the details:
1. 71 poptop westy- most Westy stuff gone, no motor,was quite a nice car
when brought in, but rather rusty.Has tranny.
2. 78 sunroof bus- no motor, has tranny, sunroof is missing crank, but
appears to be functional otherwise. Has BA-6 heater missing switch on
dash, otherwise complete.
3. 81 Vanagon yellow W/ brown seats missing motor and trans, sliding
door, fuel tank,seat belts, rear bumper and drums. This was a really
nice car with a bad fuel tank, shoulda been fixed! Nice non-rusty
panels, I may try to cut rear one off for my westy. Also has apparently
complete BA-6.
4. 70 Bug, yellow w/ black interior. This is a near driver and there is
a title and will probably be sold that way. A little rusty by the front
of the heater channels. This car just came in and was NOT flooded like
the others.
I'm going to immediately get the 71 and 78 transaxles and drain them, if
no water comes out, I'll bet they're okay as both cars look like they
were junked 'cause of rust. If I get water out, I'll have to rebuild
them, but that's  a ways down my list of priorities.
I'm not primarily in the used parts business, just trying to get my
money out of the electrical job. (Also got a dump truck and bug-eyed
Sprite!) So, removal and shipping will NOT be next day, rather more like
15-20 days. If any of this stuff sounds interesting let me know. I might
even be able to haul the bigger items some distance because a road trip
west or south sounds pretty nice in another month or two!
