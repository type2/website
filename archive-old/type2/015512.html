  I didn't hear the gurgling when I measured

&gt;
&gt;Has anybody experienced this?  Is the gurgling normal??  I am leaning
&gt;towards a clog in the fuel tank or lines feeding the fuel filter (all the
&gt;lines from the fuel filter on are in good shape and have been replaced), as
&gt;the reason the vehicle cuts out.  I am planning on draining the tank and
&gt;checking the screen tomorrow.

That may well be it. Since you did not determine rate of flow when the
audible symptom was present, it needs to be further verified. Do prepare to
drain the tank and replace that screen. If you see a lot of scale, let me
know and I'll tell you how to flush it out good without taking out the
tank, but that is only if your model has the removable outlet fitting and
screen. Usually, the F.I. models don't.
