Glad you had good results, Arnaud.

A caveat to all, air pressure is a risky idea, especially if a compressor is
used. If a piston is really stuck it could come out with quite a lot of
force, potentially risking injury and property damage. Might be a good idea
to fit a large c-clamp loosely into the piston and behind the caliper, apply
air pressure, and slowly start backing off the c-clamp. If the piston
doesn't start to come out, tighten the clamp back up, apply more pressure,
and repeat. The idea is to keep the piston from shooting out suddenly.

Eventually I used my foot air pump to blow the pistons out, turned them half
a turn, put them back in and refitted the dust seal. It was simple to do and
I cannot believe I did not think about this before. Hopefully the my job was
decent and it won't leak.

FYI, the pistons started sliding out with about 4 bars of pressure (~60
psi). It would probably take quite a bit more on an old caliper.
