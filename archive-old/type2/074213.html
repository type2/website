Subject: Help with wood headliner installation

Has anyone put the wood headliner from a hardtop westy and installed it in a
non camper?  The problem I am having is getting the last section of wood in.
I can get two but the third won't go in so I can line up the metal spacer
piece.  If it matters the wood was from a 72 and it is going into a 73.

And thanks for all the people that helped to get the list back up early...
