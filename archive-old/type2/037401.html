 &gt;Ok, boys and girls, can you help a brother out?

 &gt;I just pulled my bus out of storage (storage being under a tarp next to
my garage) and I got under it today, and there's a big old rust hole.
Guess where.   On the front lower beam.  Right at the bottom on the
passenger side where the upright meets it.  It seems to be just in the
outer case.

 &gt;I have no idea what this means.
.................sure you do. You say ....&quot;....not good&quot; in your subject 
line. You know it lived for 27 years in the rust belt and is a dangerous 
and possibly fatal condition. Until you know the extent of the other hidden 
rust in the beam, you must assume it is the tip of the iceberg that could 
sink the Titanic. If you continue to drive it and when that steering box 
lets go, in those last few seconds that seem like forever you will wish you 
had taken some different action when you had the chance.


 &gt;What should I do?

....................I _can_ only tell you what I did in similar 
circumstances three years ago for my 76 Westfalia: I shopped around the 
salvage yards in the southwest (by phone) and found an axle in Texas that 
had never seen rust. I paid for it up front, sight unseen, and the yard 
owner shipped it by truck to my mechanic in Ohio. He pulled the old axle 
and after putting on new ball joints, he put on the Texas axle and put the 
bus back together.  It wasn't easy, or quick, or cheap.  I'm still alive 
and haven't killed anyone as a result of driving he vehicle.


 &gt;I'm sure this
didn't happen over winter, and I drove it all last summer and didn't
die.
...................God must love you. The rust was there, just hadn't 
broken through.

 &gt;Should I not drive it?  Is it ok to let go until, say after I drive 
2500mi. round trip to Fla.?

...................You could run that experiment and find out. Let's hope 
you don't. The risk is having it break during the trip, and (if you are 
still alive) having to abandon the bus in a strange land, to strange people 
who probably view you as lunch. Maybe you could enjoy your trip with that 
hanging over your head. I couldn't.


 &gt;Can it be welded?
.....................That is a question for the guy that has to do the 
welding and take the responsibility for the continued functional integrity 
of the beam. It's between you and him. Personally, I'd want someone who 
does this for a living and who has done other jobs exactly like this one, 
more than once......maybe ten times.

 &gt;Do I need a new beam?
.........................Get the answer to &quot;..._dot_can it be welded (and can I 
live with it afterward?)


 &gt;Anyone have a new beam they want to sell for cheap?
................Do you really mean ...&quot;...new beam?&quot;  Maybe you could get 
by with a good safe used beam from a southwestern salvage yard. And you are 
better off to be asking these questions now, rather than later when you are 
broken down on the road and without the aid of the list and your 
comfortable familiar home surroundings and resources.  When I did this, it 
cost me over a thousand dollars before it was over with, and I was in my 
home town working with reliable experienced people.


  '77 westy.

     I'm freaking out here.  My trip is in a month, and I don't want to
drive the Scumdance.
........................there you have it. Change your plans.


     If maybe this is something you need to see, let me know, I'll get a
picture up right away.
.............................why? Check your wallet first......Show it to 
the welder when you show him the beam. Your life depends on it.  Go from there.

     Thanks.
