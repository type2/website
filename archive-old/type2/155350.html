&gt;Nothing can be more frustrating than a non fuctional AFC system---

True but why does it have to be that way...

Why are we always comparing a set of (new) dialed in carbs to a malfunctioning FI setup?

Just go over the parts, testing them, fixing the PO and his mechanic abuses, make sure the electrical contacts are good and you'll find it's reliable.

&gt;I'd much rather dial in a set of points and condensor once a year than
&gt;to be pulling my hair out trouble shooting a messed up AFC system when
&gt;it quits, and put me on the shoulder of some back road in Podunk
&gt;Nebraska.

The points and condenser are not part of the FI system. It sounds like you are confusing the electronic igntion setup from the 79 CA model with the AFC (L-Jet) fuel injection system. Only D-Jet setups had the FI trigger in the distributor.

I have no fear of driving 2,000 miles in my bus because I've put in the effort to make sure a 30 yr. old bus is road worthy enough to get me to the destination and back.
