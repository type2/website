In US units you are only getting 14.5 mpg which is very low.  You should be 
able to easily get 8-9km out of 1 liter.  How fast are you driving?  Your 
mileage will improve drastically if you stay between 90-100kph.  Also make 
sure your choke plates are fully open when the engine is warm - if not it 
will waste a lot of gas.

&gt;  , so all your cj owners  howmany degree,s are your ignitions ? and wath 
&gt; is your gasoline use?[with double carburateurs 1 one each side cj 2000cc 
&gt; 1977 ]and for the real technisians on this list how does pre ignition 
&gt; influence the ingene and what are the risk of to much pre

That's an easy one.  Too much ignition advance could cause the engine to 
knock (detonate) which would destroy your pistons and cylinder heads in a 
matter of minutes.  If you feel you must advance the timing, do it only a 
few degrees at a time and listen closely for detonation.  On hills or 
anywhere you need to use more than 1/2 throttle I would set it back to the 
stock settings to be safe.

Have a good trip,
