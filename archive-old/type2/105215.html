Subject: [T2] 65 mph expectations and head question (loss of power)

I run usually between 65-70.  I try to never go above 70.
My engine was built in 1995.  My bus is a daily driver.
I routinely drive my bus out of town, about once a month (approx.
350-400miles one way).1600cc.,  009 dist. w/compufire, and 1:25 rockers.
Everything else is stock. I agree with the increased service schedule.  I
change my oil quite often(don't run a extra filter).  My bus is not quite as
heavy as yours, but I think 65mph is possible.

I know I should probably slow down!!
