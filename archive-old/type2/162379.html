&gt; The inside of my Bus is also blue (same color as the outside), but I was
&gt; thinking about painting the steel part of my dash WHITE to match the
&gt; roof, bumpers and wheels. I'm worried about the possibility of creating
&gt; a glare on my windshield. Has anyone painted their dash, and can you
&gt; tell me if it creates a glare on the windshield, and.. if it does, how
&gt; bad is it?


it creates a terrible glare.   don't do it.
check it out put some white paper across your dash where you want to paint
and drive, especially at night
