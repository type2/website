&gt; Actualy no, I haven't noticed the noise at all while turning. I notice it

I have had a noise like this once and in investigating and pulling my hair
out I finally found that the hand brake cable had somehow come loose from
the brake inside the drum on the rear and was &quot;banging&quot; against something
on the inside of the drum.  finally found it, put it right and sound went
away

just a thought, easy to check and fix
