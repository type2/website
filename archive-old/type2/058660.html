&gt; ...EGR valve without linkage or exhaust tube...?

Should be CLOSED if linkage is disconnected. The valve has a spring that 
keeps it closed unless the linkage pulls it open. It also is designed so 
that it lets no gas through when at full throttle (when linkage 
connected). It appears designed to let exhaust gas recirculate only at 
intermediate RPMs, but not at idle and not at full throttle.

If it were otherwise, you probably wouldn't be able to start your bus- 
unless the gas distribution pipe inside the plenum or the valve itself 
are crudded shut (which is the state towards which this system always 
tends, thus the reminder light on the dash and the owner's manual 
instruction to check the system every 20K miles).
