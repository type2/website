Subject: Battery Pan Replacement?
Message-ID: &lt;19990428.182447.-520921.5.vols-fan_at_juno_dot_com&gt;

My '72 loaf has the battery flooring eaten away.  Is there a company that
sells a replacement pan that can be welded in?  Currently I have my
battery located on the other side with a LONG positive cable!

Feel free to write private.

Thanks,
