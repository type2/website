Subject: Re: [T2] Painting question

Wow.. Well, just goes to show that no one is perfect.. But this guy
obviously had a lot going for himself over his lifetime. Impressive and
interesting friend! :0) Good memories there, I see. Jan B
ps.. Thank you for sharing so much of your time to guide me. I appreciate
it.


&gt; John was elderly man when I met him. His family owned the Cadillac /
&gt; Pontiac dealership in Morgan city LA. They also owned Pelican State Lime
&gt; plant, Pelican Shrimping co (they never shrimped, just rendezvoused with
&gt; Mexican shrimpers and bought their catch) and they had a Shipbuilding
&gt; Company and of course the one thing every rich man needs *Johns Bar*.
&gt; John gave me that old Willis Overland Knight Car I previously mentioned
&gt; with the sleave valve engine.
&gt; We remained friends for the remainder of his life.
&gt; Finally got the paint right, had some experience by then.

&gt; IMO, your friend John is lucky to be alive. I'd have made him sand it
&gt; out.
&gt; Are you still friends with John?
&gt; Did you finally get the good job you wanted?
&gt; You are right.. pesky friends can really mess you up.
