&gt; 2 years ago there was plenty of battery so those occasions everything 
&gt; worked it just didn't start.
&gt; on my dead battery ones there was minimal juice just not nearly enough 
&gt; to start the bus. so now i need to either rewire my radio so i don't 
&gt; need to turn everything on to run it or listen to some other source.

I've been thinking of wiring my radio to the camping battery.  It's 
even convenient, since the power source for the electric water pump 
runs right behind the driver's kick panel.

&gt; doesn't any fuel remain in the system when the bus is turned off???

There is a little.. not sure how much gets past the regulator back into 
the tank.  But without pressure, it will lean out and die pretty 
quickly.
