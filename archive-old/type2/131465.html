Subject: RE: [T2] Just added up the cost of parts that I want/need for
  my bus

Crap. Hit send before I was finished...

It includes all the parts I want to replace, including tires and interior 
refurbishing. Does NOT include any extra labor, nor does it include paint or 
bodywork, though it includes some needed sheet metal.

Looks like my work is cut out for me... ;)

Wow.

Nearly $6k if I do everything I want (including a new engine).

Better not let the wife see this... heh
