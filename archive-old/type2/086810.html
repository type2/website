&gt; I've switched to 30 character

great!!  however setting it to a number closer to 70-75 would probably be
more convienent for you, FWIW I have mine set at 78

&gt; Now then, the sound.....
&gt; 
&gt; My point of reference is a
&gt; wrist pin bearing from my '63
&gt; that ticked away merrily for
&gt; almost a year before one day
&gt; turning to that &quot;emergency&quot;
&gt; sound that you can feel

that would have been my first guess

&gt; through the shifter. This is
&gt; not like that yet. It's more
&gt; like a knocking that I can
&gt; actually hear better while
&gt; driving than with my head in
&gt; the engine compartment. I
&gt; think it is louder while the
&gt; engine is under load and tends
&gt; to quiet down as the engine
&gt; revs up. I don't know what RPM
&gt; that would be, around 22-25 in
&gt; 2nd gear I suppose. It is also
&gt; much more noticeable when the
&gt; engine is still warming up,
&gt; although it never disappears
&gt; when warmup is complete. I

do you have hyd lifters (78+) this could be a collapsed lifter not common
but I've had it happen and it sounds about the same as you describe, very
easy and inexpensive repair.

&gt; know it's impossible for
&gt; anyone to know exactly what I
&gt; mean, but is that a little
&gt; more clear about the noise?

hmmmm.
.  does it sound louder when turning?
.  can you detect the area of the engine where it is coming from?
.  get someone to drive the van while you have your head stuck through the
hatch over the engine BE CAREFULL,  see if you can track down a location,
don't be shocked at how loud the engine is when that hatch is open.
.  does the noise stay in time with the engine RPM, or road speed??
.  is the noise louder in any particular gear, or neutral?

???

&gt; Any further thoughts?

&gt; 
&gt; .  small bits of metal in the
&gt; screen may not mean much as
&gt; the engine is
&gt; always wearing away little
&gt; bits (that's why they
&gt; eventially need
&gt; rebuilding)
&gt; 
&gt; .  you keep talking about a
&gt; &quot;sound&quot; but you don't describe
&gt; it....lot of
&gt; sounds are harmless, some are
&gt; &quot;shut the engine off NOW&quot;
&gt; critical.
