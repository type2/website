X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

i'm looking for some NON!!! dansk barrel nuts for the heater flappers on
my 78. i am 2 for 2 with defective dansk ones, both different defects, or
more precisely one with one defect and the other with the same defect and
another, all my local hardware stores couldn't help me, and i have no
interest in dansk ones. Any leads are appreciated.  also on a side note i
discovered that laundry detergent and hot water make a great degreaser.
thanks in advance
jamie
