&gt;Do any of the experts ; ) out there know the part # for the master cyl of a
&gt;70 bus. Last trip to flaps produced 3 diff ones.

Chuck,
Look at your current MC and note the stop light switches, there is either
one or two, look at the brake line outlets, either 2 or 3.  Mine was a '69,
two switches, I blocked the 3rd extra outlet with a spare switch.  Been
there done that.
