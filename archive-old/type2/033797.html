&gt; you can correct.  Improving the &quot;antisway bars&quot; might help a little bit
but they
&gt; improve body roll in corners more than the transient (would that be
phugoid?)
&gt; oscillations set up on a windy day (short period actually I guess.)  Live
with it or
&gt; drive a nice modern minivan with some semblance of aerodynamics.  Note
that

John makes an excellent point, although it might be difficult to appreciate
unless you've actually driven a bus in excellent mechanical condition.  My
assessment of aftermarket sway-bars is much more positive than John's,
though. IMO, they can *significantly* improve handling: my '75 Westy is
*almost* as stable in gusty wind as my wife's new Odyssey. No more adrenalin
rushes or missed heart beats when I'm passed by a semi. (To be fair, I
should point out that my comfortable bus highway speed is 65, whereas it's
more like 80 in the Honda.)
