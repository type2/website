Folks,
I recently posted my need for a replacement ECU, but have had no 
responses, and no real luck from quite a LOT of internet, email and 
phone searching.  I know I could get a rebuilt one from the Bus Depot, 
but these are a bit more expensive than I was expecting, and I would 
have to surrender what I have already.

Mine is an '82 Aircooled Automatic Transporter.  The ECU is VW part no 
039 906 021 C.  The lists available show that a suffix of 'CU' could also 
be suitable, but I am not QUITE sure how to interpret the equivalence of 
part numbers on the published lists.

Can anyone tell me if any OTHER parts (ECUs) would replace this one?  
 I KNOW that some vehicles will RUN with 'foreign' ECUs, but I need one 
that will do the right job.

Any suggestions/comments welcomed.

Australia is NOT a good place to be looking for parts like this.  What 
about a European list?  Is there one?

For those who remember, ?3+ years ago I posted my experiences with 
the brain in which I fixed it by tapping with a toothbrush!?  That fix 
apparently wasn't permanent, and the problem is back in a serious way.
