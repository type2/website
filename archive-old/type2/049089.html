Clark, Jonathan,

It may depend on your distributor.  

One type of dist. went with the &quot;30&quot; series carbs and its vacuum canister 
matched the vacuum available from those carbs.  I think it was vacuum-only 
advance.

When VW switched to the &quot;34&quot; series carbs I think they also switched to the 
dual vacuum/centrifigual advance dist. with a diferent sized canister because 
the vacuum signal from these carbs was different (maybe stronger?).  Later 
buses with type 4 engines continued to use them in various forms.

These seem to be the best replacement dist.s for dual port type 1's and type 
4 engines if you can get adequate vacuum to them.  One of the VW magazines 
recently featured an article on how to modify your aftermarket dual carbs 
with a vacuum port so you could ditch your dreaded .009 and all of its 
problems in favor of this dual advance dist.  

Maybe its possible to modify a single carb in a similar way?
