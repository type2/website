&gt; A friend of mine is looking for replacement muffler for his stock
&gt; 78 Bus......there appears to be  HUGE  difference in available
&gt; replacement mufflers for the stock 78 motor......(price &amp; quality)....
&gt; The Leistritz muffler on my bus has lasted for years  and years...
&gt; so my friend was asking about where to get one...???
&gt; So before he lays down big bucks for one.......
&gt; 1)   can u still buy Leistritz mufflers?
&gt; 2)   are they the best you can get?
&gt; 3) does the list reccommened another brand????


First of all, he needs to look at the exhaust diagram on my website.  The
74-78 system uses a convoluted system of pipes attaching to the muffler,
some of which are no longer available.  If this is what he has (and the
now-unavailable crossover pipe is in good shape), all he needs is a stock
replacement muffler.  But if his system looks different (i.e. is an
aftermarket extractor system), then the stock muffler will not work at all.

Assuming he needs a stock muffler, the one I am now carrying is labeled
variously as either Bosal or Ansa, and made in Belguim or Italy. This is a
very nice, heavy duty muffler.  I have found it to last about as long as the
now-hard-to-find-and-way-too-expensive Leistritz, and it's only $79.

If he currently has an extractor system, then he will have to replace it
with the same.  My Pacesetter system at $79 included everything behind the
heat exchangers, and does not approach the quality of the Bosal/Ansa, but
surpasses the other extractor systems currently available.

His final option (most expensive but probably the best long-term solution)
is to replace his heat exchangers with '72-74 units, ditch the convoluted
'75-78 exhaust system completely, and buy a much simpler '72-74 system like
yours.
