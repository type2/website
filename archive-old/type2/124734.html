Subject: Re: [T2] Zinc - is it good ?

There three different ways to apply zinc:
- a galvanizing bath
- spraying (Flammspritzverzinkung - can anyone help me with the proper
English term?)
- paint

For all of these: it only makes sense on clean rust free metal. Previously
wire-brushed bus parts are not rust-free - they are only polished.
Basically, it makes sense on new parts and sandblasted parts - and then it
is great stuff. It does not convert rust, it will only oxidize easier than
the metal it is covering and thus prevent it from oxidizing.

My heater boxes were sandblasted 10 years ago and the zinc still holds up -
no rust. And my bus is driven in winter on salted roads. I have used zinc
paint both in rattle can and brushed it on - again, great stuff if used on
clean rust-free metal. Basically, this paint is thinner, some point solids
and plenty of zinc. Once dried, the result is coat that consist to some 90%
of zinc. Do not use the shiny zinc paint, go for the flat gray variety -
about 5% higher zinc content.

Dipping is only a good idea for very sturdy parts and it even with sturdy
parts it may be a bad idea because the heat involved stresses the parts and
can make them more fragile. I would not consider dipping axle, steering, and
brake parts anymore.

There is a spray process (Flammspritzverzinkung in German) in which zinc is
melted and then sprayed onto the metal. This is also an electroplating
process in which the spray gun is the Anode (or Cathode?) and the part to be
plated is the other. This process is great for body parts and sheet metal. I
am planning to have the undercarriage of a camper sandblasted and zinced
with this process. Not cheap but pretty much the best rust-proofing out
there.
