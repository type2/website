&gt;-----SNIP---, and the clutch slave which is usually the major PITA (why
&gt;don't I
&gt;have a cable). ---SNIP---
&gt;
&gt;I left the thing hooked up the the hydraulics on my 81 Vanagon and
&gt;unbolted it from the tranny.  Still a bit of a pain - but less so than
&gt;dealing with rusty line fittings.


Oh that is exactly what I meant, taking off a hydraulic line would be real
foolishness no doubt unless you must.  Thing I hate is the acess to the damn
thing, on a wasserboxer it is a breeze as you just reach at it from the
engine compartment, on the air cooled that darn rear bolt against the
firewall is nightmarish if rusted (de facto in WV on any 15 year old Van)
but a tip I will put out is that this is the perfect location to use a
&quot;stubby&quot; 13mm wrench, even the VW tool kit wrench on the bottom and a nice
1/4&quot; drive socket driver on the top.  Still the single thing that will piss
me off most when pulling the Vanagon driveline on an air cooled van.
