&gt; &gt; hey all,

&gt; nuts in
&gt; &gt; penetrating oil and have gotten 2 off so far.  The bottom ones. 
&gt; Now for
&gt; &gt; the top ones.... is there a special tool? sheer brute force? or
&gt; should I
&gt; &gt; yoink the motor and replace my clutch while the derned thing is
&gt; out...

If all else fails, you can get a nut splitter that literally cracks the
nuts in half.  Check a well-equipped tool store.
