The answer to your question about aftermarket shifters is that some are
better than stock and some are not.  I have a Gene Berg shifter that I
really like.  If you read the archives, there have been quality complaints
about some shifters.

The bigger question is whether its worth replacing the stock shifter. 
Aftermarket shifters often have a shorter throw than stock which is nice,
but not that big a deal in my opinion.  Aftermarket shifters tend to have
fancier finishes than stock shifters for what thats worth.  However, if
your intent is to cure to cure sloppy shifting, a new shifter may not do the
job.  I am aware of four possible problems that can cause sloppy shifting:
 (1) worn shift lever (especially the ball at the base of the stock shift
lever); (2) worn bushings on the shift lever (to replace these bushings,
the engine must be removed :(;  (3) worn shift coupler bushings (easy to
replace and a very good idea); (4) worn selector components in the
nosecone of the transmission.  The last is the most involved to repair, but
until I fixed the problem, I was not able to cure sloppy shifting.  Look at
NessTek to see a fine article on repairing a transmission which includes
how to replace the selector components in the nose cone (you replace
the bushings for the hockey stick, and the ball that the inside end of the
hockey stick rides in).  The set-up is illustrated in Bentley.  The job is w/in
the ability of a DIYer.  I purchased a new nosecone, hockey stick, etc...
from Transform (see archives, transform doesn't have a great reputation
anymore)  that incorporated some improvements over the stock system.  
I think HVWs did an article on this repair at one point too (?Project
Westfalia?)  good luck,
