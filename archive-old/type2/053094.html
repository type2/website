Subject: Pop top tent hold downs

I had the problem where at freeway speeds wind would leak by the pop 
top seals and billow the tent into the interior. I am not sure how 
much of a problem it really is, but it must be putting some stress on 
the fabric and seams. Anyway the recent thread about using hood tie 
down straps and similar devices to snug down the pop top gave me an 
idea. As temporary measure I wrapped some bungee cord around the 
front pop top supports which pulled down the top tight against the 
seals. I tried it over the weekend and it worked, but I still want 
somethign more substantial. You can see a picture of how I did it at

Have a good week.
