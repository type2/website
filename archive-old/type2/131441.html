Subject: Re: [T2] fuel line hoses

When you change the fuel hoses (FI or carburetor), it helps to put a tiny 
drop of pure, liquid silicone in the fuel hose.  Just a spec...

This way, the rubber hoes will MORE EASILY slip over the metal rails / fuel 
inlets / etc.

No, not the RTV silicone use to cover the push rod tube seals (  &lt;-  humor  
), but the liquid silicone you spread over your tires or rubber window seals 
to protect them from the sun and elements.
