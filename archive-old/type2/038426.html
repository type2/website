Hi,
     Marcus writes:
&gt; when talking to people at Everybus I realized how hard it is for owners
&gt; of European market buses to get the parts they need.  Just ask Bear
&gt; about his right hand drive heater cables or his Vanagon 1600 exhaust
&gt; parts ....  The place I got all my VW in Germany from is called
&gt; Volksteile and has pretty much the same philosophy as Bus Depot:
&gt; provide all the parts you need for your bus (new and used) at
&gt; reasonable prices.  I am not sure how thrilled Cord is about me
&gt; advertising his business and the thought of shipping parts overseas but
&gt; I am sure that he would find a way to help you with parts you just
&gt; cannot get over here.  Check out: http://www.volksteile_dot_de/ Their page
&gt; is in German only, but they do speak some English. Their email is:
&gt; teiledienst_at_volksteile_dot_de If you inquire about parts I would suggest to
&gt; include the VW part number or the German part name to make sure that
&gt; you are talking about the same part.  If you need any further help,
&gt; feel free to get in touch with me (marcus_at_schaper_dot_com). I am happy to
&gt; assist anyone who has trouble finding their part in Germany or needs
&gt; assistance with payment arrangements (most German part dealers do not
&gt; accept credit cards or personal checks).  Please bear in mind that the
&gt; internet is not yet as widely used as over here. So you will not find a
&gt; browsable catalog at the Volksteile site and they might take a while to
&gt; respond to email. But they should be able to get you pretty much any
&gt; part for your bus (up to '92) well below VW prices.

 I'd suggest Just Kampers in the UK, as an alternative. I havn't heard 
anyone slagging them on the list, so they can't be doing too badly.
 They have a decent website (http://www.justkampers.co_dot_uk, strangely
enough) and a (UK-biased) chat site. They also ship overseas...and 
while the dollar/sterling exchange rate may not be doing you any 
favours you can take 17.5% VAT off the UK prices in the catalogue.
 They are happy to take credit cards, speak English etc.
 They have a new catalogue (&quot;katalogue&quot;, in JK speak :-) which isn't
yet online... shouldn't be too long.. but you can still search for 
parts.
 I get most of my VW parts from them, but have no stake in their 
business.

Cheers,
	 W.
