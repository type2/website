Hi Folks,

I've been noticing a problem with warm starting as of late.  The condition 
is as follows:  I start the engine when it's cold (sitting overnight or all 
day), run it for a short trip (5 minutes), and shut it down.  Every 4th or 
5th time I do this, then try to restart the engine when it's still 
semi-warm, the starter cranks but the engine does not fire up.  It'll kick 
over on the second or third try, but then idles roughly until the engine is 
completely warm.

I'm sure this has something to do with incomplete warmup, but I'm worried 
that this may be an indication of something worse.

Any help or advice is always appreciated.

Thanks,
Jason Upper
