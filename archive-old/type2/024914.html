&lt;&lt;Volks,

I recently bought Barry Burneskis' tent.  The tent canvas is excellent,
but the frame has a couple of small problems.  As a result I would like to
replace two of the corner pieces.  I know a shopp that can do the bending/
welding, if I can get them the tubing, but I gotta say, so far no luck. 
Does anyone know of a source for that tubing???

I took a micrometer to it and the OD of the tube is .877&quot;, necked down to
.75 at the joints. Now given the source, I would expect that the tubing
was metric diameter, so I did the conversion and it comes out at 22.28mm.

The German steel tent poles are considered to be 22mm.  There are 2 ways to
measure the poles, one being the inside dimension and the other the outside.
I believe that the larger joint on the poles to be 22mm, measured on the OD.
If you were to order a standard leg pole from Germany, you would get a 22mm
steel pole with the proper reduced end to slide into your frame corners.

Unfortunately, I don't have any listings for the corner pieces in my catalogs,
just the replacement legs and straight poles.  The new German tents have
gussets that reinforce the corners.  Are you sure your corners are too far
gone?  You may be able to weld them and add some gussets like the newer tents.
