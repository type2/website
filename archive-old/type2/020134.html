I have the wiring harness from a 76 auto bus fi if anyone needs it, $10(what i
paid the junkyard) plus shipping from boston.
jamie

&gt; This sounds possibly like the wire and wire AFM difference between 76
&gt; and 77?
&gt; The solution here is to get the ECU (Electronic Control Unit), harness,
&gt; and AFM (Air Flow Meter) all of the same year or range anyway.
