Subject: Re:Listee stickers

Well guys,
I came back to check my e-mail after posting this morning.......I believe 
there is enough interest.

Here is the scoop.....I am finalizing the artwork.  It will be a split bus 
graphic with vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com on it.  

They will be cut vinyl stickers.  I'll start of with white and black and 
worry about colors later.

I'm not positive on price ...but don''t expect them to be higher than a few 
bucks.  I will probably tack a dollar on to donate to the list fund though.

I can mail some out......I will likely accept payment with a SASE and then 
send em out.

Regarding the type2 list....If there is interest I can possibly do a bay bus 
sticker too. We'll check that out.

Soon as i get the pic scanned, I'll post it to the web in a day or so.

I'll keep you guys updated via list and will have some for OCTO.
