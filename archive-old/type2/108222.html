Subject: Re: [T2] what type oil is everyone using?? grade??

Jason,
    You asked:
&gt; just curious as to what works best in a bus engine,
&gt; its a stock 1600 and i live in california where the
&gt; weather has been 90+, the winters arent winters and is
&gt; more like spring in most midwest and eastern areas.

This past December I bought a 1600dp engine for our 71 from Bob
Donalds at the Boston Engine Exchange.  He recommended 20W50 for hot
weather operations.  In the Bentely manual there is a chart for
recommended oil versus temperature.  I believe it's in the chapter on
routine servicing, that's toward the back of the manual.
