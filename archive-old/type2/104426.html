Yes, and that was pretty much across the entire product line for several
years of production.  Very expensive to replace them all, hence the
urge to wait for failure.  VW finally got a clue when new prospective
new car buyers started to get informed of the on-going problem via the
'net.

Definitely cooled any desire I had to own a new VW.
