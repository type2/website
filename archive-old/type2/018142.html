In a recent post about my type IV conversion progress, I noted two
handfuls of vendors here on the net that have been helping me out.  Both
with parts and copious amounts of advice.  Unfortunately, one all
important listing was left out.

Gary is having a blast up there installing CIS FI in sand rails and just
tearing up the hills.  One of his customers just put CIS in his 1776
powered bus and it is said to be quite enjoyable to drive.

If any of you are sick of tuning those dual carbs, tired of not having a
choke for those cold mornings, want to investigate other fuel methods
for your baby, check out Gary's site.

Sorry for the miss Gary, it wasn't intentional!
