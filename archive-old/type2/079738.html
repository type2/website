Subject: Re: [T2] 30/31/34 Solex on type 4 engine? 

Where did you have them rebushed?  I was under
the (mis)understanding that parts beyond the
basic rebuild kit were not available to rebuild
my stock dual solexes.

&gt; 
&gt; &lt;&lt; Any way to adapt solex to type 4 engine? 
&gt; Fabricate a space to put on top 
&gt; of a progressive weber manifold?  Any other
&gt; single carb manifold options for 
&gt; type IV &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; VW put fuel injection on the type 3 and type 4
&gt; in 1968; they put twin carbs 
&gt; on the bus in 1972.  It would appear that to
&gt; efficiently move these heavy 
&gt; vehicles at highway speeds they decided FI or
&gt; twin carbs were necesary to 
&gt; satisfy the US market.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sure you could find a local shop to
&gt; fabricate an adapter for a single 
&gt; solex by cutting and splicing together a stock
&gt; bug manifold and an 
&gt; aftermarket weber-bus intake manifold.
&gt; 
&gt; The big question is how much work, fabrication
&gt; and $$ in manifold and preheat 
&gt; adaptation will you go through to save how many
&gt; $$ in carb costs?  
&gt; 
&gt; Then, how much performance will you have lost
&gt; to save the $$?
&gt; 
&gt; When all is said and done, you might be farther
&gt; ahead buying a cheap set of 
&gt; used stock twin bus 34
&gt; PDSIT's/manifolds/linkage from a 72/73/74 bus
&gt; and 
&gt; having the throttle shafts re-bushed.  My 74
&gt; bus had them and they were a 
&gt; much better quality system than most of the
&gt; aftermarket twiin carb kits for 
&gt; buses.
