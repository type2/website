Subject: [T2] Re: starter problem

&gt; is the automatic starter and the manual starter that much different,
size, strength? 

No. Not much different. Auto starter has a shorter shank on the gear that
engages the flywheel. A guys who builds rail cars in AZ told me auto
starters are a little better sealed against water.

&gt; its possible the alternator is bad or vibrated loose a connection

This is a possibility.

&gt; anyone know if a bad voltage regulator would cause battery drain?

Could cause poor charging, which is a similar problem.

Sounds like a problem with charging system. But I would expect the
jumpstart to have helped things and you say it didn't. Check alternator,
voltage regulator, cables to battery, cables to starter, battery.

An old starter would just not start. If it goes, but feels weak, it's
probably lack of juice somehow.

I would definitely inspect/ replace fuel lines right away too. 

Good luck,
