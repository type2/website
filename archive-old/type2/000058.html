If you've been in to Volkswagens for ANY length of time, let me share a 
thought.
We all know the v-dubs are dwindling in numbers every year in greater numbers 
than I would like to see.  Unfortunately with it goes the employees that work 
on or around v-dub related material.  We loose great mechanics and 
knowledgeable volks from age as well as circumstance.  We have put these 
after market companies in business and can also close their doors.  That 
depends greatly not only the quality of the parts and labor, but the quantity 
of the parts and labor.  You pay for what you get.  So think the job threw 
entirely, and use the opinions gained in this room to your benefit.  In the 
long run it helps us all.  Be it doing the job right or having the job done 
right.  Lets keep them out of the junkyards and backyards where they get put 
to sleep entirely way to often and to long. Please do your part to ensure the 
v-dubs a good start in the next millennium.
Peace Out
