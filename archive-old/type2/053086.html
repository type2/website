Subject: Re: Shifting

Hi Peter,
I'm relatively new to buses (and this list), but I've encountered this
problem - and it was not bushing. My '76 Bus suddenly refused to shift
anything, when the engine was running.
Tha problem was broken arm that disengages the clutch, so: check it out. At
first I thought I broke pressure plate or something, but in the end it
wasn't that dramatic.
Forgive me if I used some non-standart descriptions, I'm not native speaker.
BTW, do you know that your name is typical Czech name? It means something
like: little sodbuster (or peasant) :)

cheers, Jan
