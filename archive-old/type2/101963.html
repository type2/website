Whoa- I thought that the external screw adjustment on the AFM only
affected the IDLE mix?
You imply it can affect the mix during normal running?  My mechanic also
adjusts the AFM mix by going to lean until it stumbles, then back in to
first smooth idle.

0) NOW and ONLY now that you have verified that it isn't some other
&gt; problem you can adjust the mix. If it is still there remove the metal
&gt; plug over the adjuster screw. Ideally you want to set this with a CO
&gt; meter, but you can get pretty close by adjusting the mix for the leanest
&gt; setting that gives a smooth idle, then enrich by 1/4 turn. Test drive
&gt; the car and watch for surging at part throttle. If it exists, then
&gt; enrich 1/4 turn at a time until this disapears.
