Subject: RE: Funky Engine Rhythm

So here's some more thoughts on this problem:

Could it be part of the fuel injection system? Fuel filter, fuel pump, fuel dampner? I started digging around in the Muir book and got completely lost last night. If you can't tell I'm a bit of a newbie, so any leads on solving this problem would be greatyl appreciated.

I recently bought a '77 Westfalia and have been having a great time getting to know it, cleaning it up and getting it running right.

recap:

'77 Westy with a '79 automatic, fuel-injected engine. Chronology:

Bought bus
Had exhaust fixed
Changed oil
 - Rough idle in Park
Starting tracking down horn fix
Added Fuel Injector Cleaner on full tank of gas
- Strange rhythm started shortly after
Fixed horn

I know that is a little convoluted, but I'd really like to figure out what this is. I have a feeling it's a simple thing that I may have done, or the injector cleaner.

Can anyone out there with some psychic engine troubleshooting skills help me?

Thanks for listening,
