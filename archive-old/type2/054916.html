Subject: Frozen engine??

A lurkers first post...

The other weekend I went camping with the bus, it was roughly a 2 hour drive 
to the site.  I parked Friday night, and didn't move it until Sunday.  I 
smelled a bit of gas throughout the weekend, but it didn't seem too bad.  
Sunday afternoon I checked the oil (it was OK) and tried to start it up.  I 
heard *Thunk* and the engine didn't turn over.  Tried again and heard the 
starter click, but it still wouldn't turn the engine over.  I hadn't been 
paying attention the first time, but I'm sure it was *Thunk*, not click - as 
if the engine turned a bit, then stopped suddenly.  Nobody else was there to 
hear it and were convinced it was a dead battery, I had the feeling the 
engine was frozen for some reason.  Jump starting still just produced the 
starter click.  I turned the engine with a wrench, just a bit, but it turned 
(counterclockwise is what I tried).  Next we tried pull-starting (similar to 
push-starting, but we towed the bus since it wasn't downhill).  As I was 
being towed along, I let out on the clutch - in 1st gear - and the rear 
wheels locked up (same in 2nd gear).  &quot;Hmmm,&quot; I said, &quot;I know push starting 
is not this hard.&quot;  We towed it out to the pavement and tried again, this 
time the tires locked up and squealed.  On the way back to the campsite I 
tried it a couple more times, and then the wheels (and engine) turned and it 
started right up.  It idled fine.  It has run fine since, there has been no 
oil leaks, starts fine every time, and has plenty of power (the usual amount 
anyway). I haven't checked the compression to see if it was affected.

A little history:  Flash (the bus) is a '73 riviera camper, rebuilt 
frankenstein 1700-ish pancake engine roughly 30,000 miles ago, new weber 
progressive carb about 3,000 miles ago, new electric fuel pump at engine 
rebuild time.  Every now and then, since the new carb, it has coughs and 
spudders a bit after I turn it off.  There is no fuel pressure regulator 
but, when I bought the fuel pump, I was told that it had a low enough 
pressure output to work with my bus.

So, my theory is...  The shut off valve in the carburetor is sticking and 
didn't close, allowing fuel to slowly pass through (hence the smell).  The 
fuel made it's way to the cylinders and flushed the oil out, causing the 
pistons to stick when I tried to start it??.  After it turned over, new oil 
was present and all was well.  I have had my crankcase fill with gas before. 
  I parked it for 1/2 year down in Texas (hot) with a non-vented gas cap.  I 
think the built up pressure each day as everything got hot would force gas 
down the line, and eventually into the crankcase.  That's the only guess I 
have anyway.

If this could be the case, what are the chances of having done damage to the 
rings and cylinders?  Has anyone had a similar experience?

In retrospect, I should have turned it over a few times by hand, oiled the 
cylinders (through the spark plug holes?), and pulling it in 4th instead of 
1st would have more torque, and have an easier time turning over the engine.

Any insight would be appreciated.
