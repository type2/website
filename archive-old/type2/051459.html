Hi Volks,

I'm planning on holding a contest at the local Community College to solicit
designs for the paint job to be deployed on Das Über-Kamper. I want a design
I can execute using brushes, rollers and the colours of enamel you can buy
at Home Depot. Just the kind of creative challenge that graphic Design
students live for. I Hope. I'm offering the student who submits the winning
design $100 cash and a professional photo for their portfolio.

What I was hoping someone on the list can help with is that I need some
lineart images of a 74-79 Baywindow westy. Are there any suitable images in
an owners manual somewhere. I have a front profile and side view, I just
need a rear view and  3/4 view of the rear-passenger side. If anybody has
these, please let me know. These images will be posted on a website for the
students to use as templates to base the designs on.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
