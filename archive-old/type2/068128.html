Subject: CV joint question

I have a '74, and while replacing the alternator this weekend (which
decided to seize up about a mile from home, I noticed my CV boots look
cracked.  Only the passenger side one is torn, and it is a very small tear
at that.  I don't hear any weird noises, but was wondering exactly what to
listen for.  Do they grind, or whine or what?  Also, is this a difficult
fix?  They look relatively easy to get at, but those bolts holding them on
could be hard to remove due to grime and rust.

Thanks,
Craig
