Subject: BNNTA event map...

Hi all,

Around the Bowman household, we're frantically packing up three of our Buses
to depart early Friday morning for Mark Twain Lake for the BNNTA event!  We
just switched over to Google Maps on the event web site http://www.bnnta_dot_com
and you can select the &quot;Sat.&quot; image to see a cool satelite photo of the
placement of the BNNTA event campground right on the lake..Ain't technology
great!

You can use Google to plot your turn-by-turn course to the BNNTA event.  I've
already received calls from a bunch of Buses already on their way to the
event, many arriving today (Thursday).  It'll be fun to watch them stream into
the campground all afternoon/evening tommorrow.  If you can't join us, have a
great holiday weekend wherever you'll be.
