well funny story,.,.,.,.
for the longest time that i have been a bus driver and owner i have always blocked off fuel lines with a pencil,..,.,.
now i dont no if thats ok or not,.,.,.,.? anybody else i know uses bolts or what not to plug it.,,.,.
ok so i'm diffrent,.,.,.,. LOL.....
i have never paid any attention to which end of the pencil i stuck in the fuel line for a cap off but lets say it was time to recognize this important fact LOL .,.,.,. (grins)
 
well a buddy of mine and me haveing been working on my ole bus for sometime now just last week was left in confusion after installing his loaner engine that had been rebuilt from bottom up....
We also have brand new starter among all sorts of new goodies,,,,,.
brake booster and all new lines and just everything like it should be...
well this being last week and my mind being what it is these days it seems.... we couldnt possibly get it to crank,.,.,.,.?
left in total confusion.....
 
we let it be till today and had that goal oriented smile ,,,(she was going to start today dad blame it LOL,..,.,.
 
so where we left off all hooked up and ready to go,.,.,.,.,. 
should have to hit the key and set timing and tighten down dizzy,,.,,.,.
yeah right suppose to.....~!~!~!~!~!~!~
 
well she would try to start with carb spray but wouldnt roll on over,,.,., 
 and we check the fuel line this time from the fuel pump and sure nuff 
\
where in the world did our gas go;;; wasnt none....? 
 
so we pulled the line and i crawled under there and unpluged the end and let it hang down and still no fuel... ok whats happ N here i thought as i heard it bubbling in the tank....
and in the line i thought?
 
just then as i pinched up the tube i felt a knot about 4 inches down from the end.,.,.,.that connects to the fuel pump...
i gently squeezed and was soon spitting out fuel ,,............
i thought about it and this is what the knot was..,.
 
me being careless stuck the end of the pencil in the tube for a plug erase side in line first,.,.,.,.
well it plugged it alright good enough to cause a big ole headache,,,..
after the fuel bath and a small snip off the end of the line we were in business and today 
Grace made her first road experience since August 2003.....
 
(The Moral to the story )
 
so indeed if you are in need of a plug and for whatever reason you do decide to use a pencil for a plug  make sure that it is eraser up not down...
 
______________ got a real good laugh out of that one.,.,.,.
peace to you all and yours....
Chris
