Spunky1:

BTDT, with the help of this list!

Having had the exact same problem, I'm afraid I can tell you that you will
have to reconnect the motor and trans, then remove the motor and trans as a
unit, find out why the engine is binding, and then free it up so you can turn
the torque convertor.

FWIW, get a few friends to help you drop the engine. It helps, and after
that, if they're still friends, you will need them to get the engine back
in.  ;^)

&gt; hello,
&gt; I have a 1974 westy with an 1.8L engine with duel carbs, automaic
&gt; transmission. The engine crank won't turn over so i decided to drop  the
&gt; engine.  i removed carbs, and electrical wiring from engine. also the 4
&gt; bolts that hold the trans to the engine. as well i removed the two bolts
&gt; from the engine mounts, on both sides (i have a chain round the trans
&gt; ready to support its weight). I am following the directions in the
&gt; Robert Bently manual. it says to remove 4 bolts from the torque
&gt; converter through the hole that was machined in the flange next to where
&gt; the engine and trans join. this involves turning the crank so that you
&gt; can visably see and remove each bolt from the converter as it turns
&gt; round with the crank. problem is as i said i can't turn the crank at
&gt; all. what other alternatives do i have to geting the engine removed? is
&gt; it possible to do it without removeing the egine and trans as a whole?
&gt; cause i would really rather not do that. The engine only seems to be
&gt; connected to the trans, but maybe i'm forgting to disconnect something
&gt; else?
&gt;
&gt; thanks for your time
