Bob and the list,

I have pictures up on my web page showing the setup with the Thule Roof Rack
&amp; Canoe (see bottom of post).

This setup is perfect for day trips if you do not want to pop the top.

If overnighting and need the top up, the front portion must be removed.
This is accomplished by unscrewing the knobs at the base of each riser then
lifting risers and cross bar off as one unit, re-installation is the
reverse.  I have found that when tightening the knobs it is a good idea to
pull the riser base away from the bus to get it to the outside of the rain
gutter.  This lessens the likelihood of having to re-tighten the knobs down
the road.

Thule does not endorse this setup, the only reason I can think of is that
the rain gutters on a Type 2 are weak.....

....but....

I have had the Canoe on top while driving on some pretty rough dirt roads
with lots of rocking from side to side and the rack never moves.  Haven't
had to slam on the brakes really hard yet though....

The Westy roof rack can still be used for low profile items like lawn chairs
and firewood with a canoe on top.  I plan on getting one more set of risers
and a bar so that I can put two bikes on either side of the canoe.  Prolly
not until next year though.....

I refuse to modify or butcher the Fiberglass Pop Top in any way.

......G.A.S.S. Report.....

Took the 71 Westy to the show on Sunday with my Wife and the girls
(shelties - http::/pw2_dot_netcom_dot_com/~mottware/sheltie.html ).  The weather was
absolutely fantastic, the bus ran great, the dogs loved it, and we saw lots
of great looking VW's.

There were some really nice Bay Windows there.  TBear was there with his
cool bus, it has wood trim where the chrome deluxe waistband would go -
really nice.  Saw Eric O with his Vanagon/GTI setup - he says he can go as
fast as he wants, hm - must be nice. :)  When we arrived someone told us
they were auctioning a new pop-top canvas but by the time we made it over to
the area it had been sold.  Not for $350.00 nor $250.00 or even $150.00...it
sold for around $95.00!!!!  Had 3 windows too. :0  TBear helped us try to
find the buyer in case he didn't want to haul it home but we couldn't find
him.
Oh well, so it goes.

Saw a Double Cab for sale - $20,000....no comment.

Since I couldn't spend any money :( we left fairly early and took the long
way home.  No mechanical problems and enjoyed the show.  We'll be back next
year.

Anybody from Cleveland going to BBTA?

Thanks for the bandwidth.....
