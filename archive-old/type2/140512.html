Subject: Re: [T2] Timing revisited

----- Original Message ----- 
From: &quot;George Lyle&quot;

The strobe flashers have their own time base and their
&gt; strobe rate is probably not critical.  A timing light gets its signal from
&gt; the ignition.

My point was about the tolerance of the components inside each unit being
the same but outcome being different.

Joey.
