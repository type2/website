Subject: tune up mysteries....

Greetings once again... Perhaps in a while I'll be the one giving advice
instead of constantly asking for it....

Did a tune up yesterday and changed my oil and adjusted the valves this
morning....  The bus (71) is running like caca...(terribly)

I replaced the:  dizzy cap, rotor, spark plugs (wires were done 2500 miles
ago), condenser, points (dwell is 52 deg.), set the timing at 5
deg ATDC (in accordance with Muir and Bentley for the AE704 case), 
adjusted the valves with the engine cold this morning, and changed the
oil.  Everything was double checked to specs and seemed ok.  I adjusted
the idle this morning when I started it up and it was running like s**t.
Didn't seem to help much.  

Idle mixture is right at 3 turns out from the bottom.  Idle is at 800rpms,
but very rough.  The choke works, but is very difficult to adjust.
However, it does open the b-valve as the engine warms (1 minute today).

When I drive the bus, there is substantially less power than before I
tuned it and it seems to run hotter than it did.

I think that's all I can recall.  

My question is:  Is the timing correct for my case and dizzy.  The case #
is:  ae704175 and there were 3 numbers on my dizzy, but I'm not sure which
one is the part number (or maybe they all are):  jfudr4,   1 231173 001,
and 211 9052050

Timing set at 5 deg. atdc.

Or is this perhaps a air/fuel mixture problem?

Or worse...?

I always love the mystery of tuning up a car and having it run worse than
before, especially when you feel you've been sooooooo careful..

Ah well, that's the joy of problem solving and the empowerment of fixing
it yourself...

Thanks all..
