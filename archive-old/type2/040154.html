I can see one or maybe two &quot;delays&quot; or &quot;misunderstandings.&quot;  But there
seems to be an awful lot of people coming forth with complaints.

And yes, moving and a divorce can put a damper on things.  If so, STOP
TAKING PEOPLE'S MONEY if you know you can't follow thru on the committment!
  I get the feeling - I can't verify this - that the money received to
cover orders went to fund the move, divorce, kid problems, etc,  so the
necessary capital to cover those orders may be short.  So new orders would
have to come in so the people who have been waiting however long can get
their stuff.  Accept an order from Peter to pay Paul.  It's a difficult
position to pull out of, which is why most small businesses fail.

It seems that the people who are most willing to cut her slack are not the
same people who have money on the table.

Drag her name thru the mud on 5 lists?  Well, she *advertised*, so to
speak, on probably all 5 of those lists.

&gt;I seem to recall that just this week someone here on our list received a

&gt;down, why not support her on her way back up? It seems she's getting it
&gt;back together.
&gt;
&gt;We've all been there. And if we haven't yet, we will someday. Karma, man.
&gt;
&gt;Besides, It appears from Clara's e-mail (once you sort through all the
&gt;vitriol) that her problem is with Dawn's (EX)HUSBAND. So why drag Dawn's
&gt;name through the mud on five VW mailing lists, including VW_Bug? That's,
&gt;like, the entire Internet VW community. That's ugly, man.
