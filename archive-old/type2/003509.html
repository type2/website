Hello all,
Today me and padme where strolling down the road and the most interesting
thing happen, guess what? dun dun dundun..... she had a
fit..strange thing was she was only 2 blocks from my parents house, even
stranger still I live 20miles from my parents I was just in that end of
town. Ok so I pulled over, barely, and skated over to my parents and
enlisted the assistance of my stepfather who I sometimes have trouble
talking to and dealing with, anyway he was very helpfull and it ended up
being a moment for us to bond as well as an opportunity to help get me
and padme back on our journey. Oh the problem ended up being the little
plastic guide on the points had broken so there was no gap in the
points. the part was all of $4 and the parts store was only half a block
away.
