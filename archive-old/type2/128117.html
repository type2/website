Subject: 81 Westy For Sale

1981 Westfalia-Cal. edition - no points!
Located near Mass/RI border. Full camper; stove, sink, fridge. From West
coast, no winters since. New 3-window canvas &amp; pop-top seals, stainless
pop-top bolts, roof rack brackets. 
Engine rebuilt approximately 5,000 miles ago with Mahle Pistons and top
componets,  Crank and rods and heads professionally rebuilt. CVs, ALL
fuel lines, clutch, throw-out bearing, motor mounts and more replaced at
that time.  
Brakes: rubber &amp; some steel lines replaced, new rear wheel cylinders,
front calipers. 
Gas tank, painted, sender and all vent lines and seals replaced.  
Exterior:  has dent, scratches, but pretty straight otherwise; typical
dented bumpers. Very clean underneath.  Interior: seats need covers or
re-upholtering (cabinets, curtains and upper bunk in very good shape). 
Call for more details, can send pictures.  Asking $3,750 - spent at least
$3,700 on van after purchase.  Wife wants to buy water cooled Westy
weekender (no stove, fridge, sink) with pop-top after using a friend's
van for 2 weeks on vacation.  So that's why I'm selling this one, despite
all the hard work.
