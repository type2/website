Subject: Re: [T2] Which year bus for resto.

Matt,

I personally have had 69, 71, 74 and 79 buses and HIGHLY reccomend a 76 or 
later bus if plan to drive it a lot and use it as a regular camper.

The engines are much stronger and more reliable than the earlier &quot;bug&quot; 
engines, fuel injection is more dependable and demands less fiddling with than dual 
carbs, hydraulic lifters do not require frequent valve adjustments, engine 
access is much better with removeable top hatch, they have disk brakes and the 
camper packages offer a full double bed above along with a more practical floor 
plan down below.
