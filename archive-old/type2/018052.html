&gt; I'm trying to adjust the timing in my '81 vanagon (calif) since I've just
&gt; replaced my distributor... I'm wondering if I'm looking at the correct
&gt; timing notch.  From earlier posts I've learned that the timing indicator is
&gt; a small notch in the pulley (which looks like someone took a hacksaw to
&gt; it).  I've found a couple of these 'notches' on my pulley... which one is
&gt; correct?  One I found was on the outer diameter of the pulley on the front
&gt; side of the belt (front of course being toward the front of the vanagon).
&gt; The other is on the backside of the belt on the outer diameter of the
&gt; pulley.  Does anyone with a similar vehicle know if one of these 'notches'
&gt; is the correct timing indicator???

John,
The notch that Volkswagen put on the pulley is on the FRONT side of the
pulley (front being toward the front of the van) and is a small v-shaped
notch.  The one on the REAR side of the pulley is not the Volkswagen
notch.
