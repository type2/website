&gt; ps: Just to keep this VW, I had a '59 once that wouldn't start. Crank over
&gt; real nice until the batt ran out, just wouldn't start. I could push start
&gt; it, worked good like that.  Tried most everything, asked experts, lot's of
&gt; ideas...nothing worked.
&gt;         The batt turned out to need lot's of water, all 3 cells. Seemed it
&gt; had enough juice to crank it but not enough to crank and fire. I used a
&gt; mirror to check the water after that.

Yep. That's why many of the early 12V cars ran a resistor inline w/ the 
coil. In normal operation, the coil would work off 6 to 9 volts... but 
during cranking, it got the full 12V. Chryslers started right away, or 
not at all. They used a variable resistor. 12V when it started cranking, 
but gradually increasing resistance. (If it didn't start in 2 or 3 
cranks, shut of the ignition, wait 15 seconds, try again.)

I'm glad to see someone else has had the same problem.
