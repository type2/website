&gt;As a side note - since this is my first rebuild I think I am experiencing
&gt;some sort of pre-engine assembly anxiety.
&gt;Anyone else remember this happening? :)

Every time.  And you think you are hearing noises you aren't
hearing, and are sure it will just seize any moment.

If it went together smooth and you took your time, the worst
you might face is a little oil leak or something you really didn't
want, but likely nothing catastrophic 8-)  

Oh yeah, and Loctite red on the cam bolts.  And Loctite 572
for the case to avoid those pesky oil leaks.
