Subject: [T2] bus accident

I agree with Terry's assessment.... used to own an autobody shop in Chicago, so 
have seen a few of these cases before.  If this were a late model, you would 
probably get a new front panel plus some time on the rack to straighten the 
pillar.  But it is not new, so the insurance company will offer you as little 
as the book allows, saying they want to total it.  My 2&quot; worth of advice: (1) 
Make sure you have no medical issues now, and reasonable assurance of none in 
the future, before you sign anything or say anything. If the docs say you may 
develop back problems, or neck problems.... then you should find a lawyer and 
be guided accordingly. (2) You have the right to retain ownership of the 
vehicle for the difference 

   book value - salvage value (of parts, scrap metal, etc)

In other words, they give you book value*, you give them salvage value and 
retain title.  Before you agree to do this, you should assure yourself you can 
find someone to fix the Bus for an acceptable number of dollars.  I gather 
there are a couple of very good Type 2 repair guys in your neck of the woods, 
Randleman, N.C. was mentioned on this List not long ago.

*This is assuming book is less than repair estimate.
