Subject: RE: [T2] Ebay quote of the day...

Man, I must have a real potty head.... I was beside myself, I thought it was
soo funny.  The entire time I thought we were talking about a NEW OLD STOCK
&quot;Stool&quot; as in... ahem... waste. One from a Camper mind you...
 
And then when you said &quot;Used, but it's the nicest one I've ever seen&quot; that
was just the icing on the cake.

The headline title reads &quot;NOS Camper Stool!&quot;

Open the ad and it reveals that the stool is &quot;Used,

but its the nicest one I've ever seen&quot;

HUH?!?! NOS=NEW OLD STOCK &gt;&gt;

NOS = Not Overly Sat (on)... ?-(
