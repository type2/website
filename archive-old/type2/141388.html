Subject: Truth in Advertising (Friday Funny)

After the recent thread regarding truth in advertising, it seems that at
least one supplier has decided to be completely candid about what they will
send you.

A friend of mine stumbled on this link. Read the product description. I had
a lousy day today and this came just at the right time to change my mood
entirely. I was rolling on the floor laughing. :-)
