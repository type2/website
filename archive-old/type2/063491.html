Hi all 
2 quick questions...
1) as far as timing is concerned, is advanced timing considered
when the mark on the pully is to the right or the left of the
engine seam?
2) when A car won't start, but the battery will operate radio
, etc, and the car can be jump started easily, is this a symptom
for a solinoid problem.
Thanks.....
