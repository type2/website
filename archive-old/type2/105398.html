Subject: Fuel Starvation?

I've had an intermittent problem that has gotten drastically worse.  It
started months ago with some slight bucking under load, and has gotten
progressively worse until I can't start and run reliably right now.

I have a fuel filter and plan to swap that out.  Fuel pump, maybe?  I'm
going to try to get this done at work today, so any hints about what I
can look at are most appreciated.

Thanks!

Teri
