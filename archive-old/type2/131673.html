Subject: RE: [T2] Eliminating Test Plug &amp; Extra Wires

I would be suprised if Mr. Atwell doesn't have one or know where to find 
one. He has some cool toys.

&gt;From: &quot;Sharpe, Steven&quot; Does anyone have a dealership testing unit?

&gt;That would be the ultimate piece of VW collectables.


From Michael Knight
&gt;Tom I have been pondering that same thing. PO on my bus has already
&gt;clipped
&gt;several of them. Including the Big Red/White one. I don't know about you
&gt;but
&gt;I am not planning on making this bus exactly stock, and never ever plan
&gt;on
&gt;taking it to the dealership from them to plug into the test unit. If
&gt;anyone
&gt;out knows please share. Will removing the test block completely with
&gt;wires
&gt;create any adverse effects?
