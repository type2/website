I pasted this a number of days ago but I'm not sure it went through... I'll 
give it one more try

Ok to start off I'm going to paste (with thanks to him) the info that Jerry 
posted a week ago Presented by  The Flat Four Fetish  VW Club of Prescott , 
AridZona--

May 19th &amp; May 20th--Prescott, AridZona
Saturday --  Rally Tour 3-5PM
Street show in downtown Prescott FREE!!!

Sunday--Show Time 8AM-3PM
Show is on the Grass--$10 per VW
Swap Meet--Raffle--Games--Surprises--Family Fun!!
proceeds benefit Youth Crisis Center

contacts--520-776-4576--comwest_at_att_dot_net

PS--This is a beautifull Area and Show!!

Ok next, I'm hoping on leaving saturday morning (before it gets too
incase my dpd unit is still out of whack) I'm thinking maybe the home depo 
by the freeway but if somebody has a more central location speak up! I 
myself am planning on a classic bus campout overnight... then taking in the 
show and leaving later on sunday. my VW isn't very pretty to look at but I 
think I'll put it in the show anyway ;) Ok guys, hit me back! let me know 
what you think... hopefully we can get a nice group going!
hasta luego,
-Andrew - '71 bus
