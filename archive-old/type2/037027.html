&gt; I was worried about the position of my dist driveshaft too, so i checked

&gt; the drive gear on the crank. Did i miss it?

When the engine is at TDC on the fireing stroke  of #1, then the slot in
the distributor drive should be across the width of the engine and offset
to the rear.  Kind of a puzzle when the engine is apart as in Wilson.

I think that the endplay setting is overrated.  this thing doesn't wear
much in normal use, there is a spring to keep the drive against the shims,
and that should take care of any slop in the system.  The VW manual
doesn't even address endplay that I can see, instead just telling you to
be sure to install the two washers/shims.

&gt; Is it true that as long as the cam/crank relationship is right (dot on cam
&gt; gear between the two on the crank) all should be well?

Well, the drive may be mispositioned, which is important if you are using
a vacuum advance distributor, as you won't be able to position it
properly.

&gt; There is no 'backwards' for the dist drive gear or the driveshaft, right?
&gt; Right?!?

No backwards, except in relation to TDC on #1.
