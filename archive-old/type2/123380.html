Subject: RE: [T2] Anyone tried 27x8.5x14 on wide five rims?

What's a wide five rim?  I'm using B.F. Goodrich All Terrain TA tires on my 
'78 stock rims, which are 5.5&quot; wide, I think.  They look 
fan-freakin'-tastic, but there is a looseness somewhere in my suspension 
that I have been unable to locate that makes even small bumps go &quot;KLUNK!&quot;, 
so I can't comment on the handling.  My bus handles horrible.  I mean 
absolutly horrible.  There is no way people bought these cars new if this is 
stock handling.  The cheap tires on it when I bought it handled just about 
the same as these, but as I said, I know something major is wrong somewhere 
else.  I've got new KYB shocks, wheel bearings, and steering dampner, and 
everything feels tight when I grab and yank it, but the &quot;KLUNK&quot; is loud when 
the front wheels hit the potholes in my gravel driveway.  ARRRRGH!  OK, well 
I'm way off topic now, you probably meant 5 lugs anyway.  Happy bussing, and 
if you get B.F. Goodrich All Terrain TAs, let me know what I should be 
expecting out of my bus.  Thanks!
