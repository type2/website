Subject: Re: [T2] Rotary Fan Switch 


&gt; Where can I find a rotary fan switch that looks factory. I'd like a 4
&gt; position switch (off,high,med,low). Rocky Mountain Motorworks carries the
&gt; knob, but not the switch.
&gt; 
&gt; The switch that I'm trying to copy can be seen at
&gt; http://www.type2_dot_com/rvanness/accessor.htm - Scroll about halfway down.
&gt; Someone told me that I could probably order it if I had the part number, but
&gt; the picture is to blurry to read.

I can't help you just yet but I have a set of those fans in transit to me,
with switch. I'd be happy to send you the part number off the switch when
it gets here. Does anyone know to which fuse the fresh air fans were
originally wired?
