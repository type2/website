Subject: Re: [T2] LP tank color ?

Rustoleum has a hammered finish in silver that looks 
really good.  I took off all the fittings from my tank, 
wire-wheeled as much of the old crud off, then painted it 
with the hammer finish paint.  It looks brand new and the 
hammer finish hides any sanding blemishes very nicely. 
 Everyone thinks I have a new tank ;)
