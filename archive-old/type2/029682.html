&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So I guess my first step is to back out to an intermediate shim and try to get
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my endplay closer to 0.05 and see if that sorts me out for the time being.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; this did it.  not sure what the endplay is now, but I just kept going
&gt; &gt; &gt; down in shims until i could turn the crank.  Hopefully this is still in the right
&gt; &gt; &gt; endplay range.

&gt; and mike dwyer responded:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 0.006 is the wear limit.  How are you measuring your endplay?
&gt; 
&gt; with a snap-on dial gauge, courtesy of Bob (orangevw).  At least that's how 
&gt; i had measured it last night at Bob's.  When I drove home (in my honda, with 
&gt; the 1600 in the trunk), I realized that the crank (or something) was getting  
&gt; hung up on something, and that pehaps I needed to substitute in a smaller shim.
&gt; 
&gt; The &quot;whole&quot; story is that we had measured the endplay with the dial gague to 
&gt; between 0.06 and 0.07, moved to thicker shims -- i.e. replaced
&gt; a 0.024 and a 0.028 with two 0.034's (do I have an extra zero in there?)
&gt; and then measured the endplay to be 0.0035-0.004.  When I got home, 
&gt; I found out that the engine was hung up and replaced the 0.034's with a
&gt; 0.030 and a 0.032, and bingo! the engine, she turns.  I'm hoping that since
&gt; i just shaved off 0.006 of the 0.016 of shimmage that i added, I'm under
&gt; 0.006 and hopefully just around 0.004 or 0.005, but i should check with 
&gt; Bob's dial gague sometime soon...

You were probably measuring the play in the bearing/case interface, not
the crank/bearing interface.
This is not a good thing, though I have driven tens of thousands of miles
on an engine similarly afflicted.

Be sure that you don't get the endplay too tight.  It's hard to measure
with the bearing moving on the case, so err on the loose side.  Do split
the case at the earliest to remedy the loose bearing
