Subject: RE: [T2] Type 2 in France and Switzerland

&lt;But who keeps their cars that long anyway. My mom's Toyota's battery is
covered for 10 years. She will keep it 5 at the most.&gt;

Me. I'm done buying anything new ever and done buying anything until we pass 200K miles. That will be past 10 years for both our cars. Too expensive any other way. 

&lt;I have done the math for a full electric car for use in my area. As of two
years ago, it would cost 50 cents per day to charge it.&gt;

Would work well in this town too. Prob is how to stay warm in the winter and what the cold does to the batteries. 

$2.50 here today. And your place?
