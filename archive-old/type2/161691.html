Subject: Re: [T2] auto trans wont shift

&gt;the spring goes towards the rear of the accelerator lever.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;tranny  -----lever----(((adj nut)))||spring,(c-clip
&gt;                                    ||
I have it the exact opposite way=the spring is at the gas pedal=I didn't 
have anything to go by- &gt;

adjusting the linkage needs to be done EXACTLY as it
&gt;is step by step in the Bentley.

if it's not too long and if you still have the Bentley, would you be able to 
tell me the procedure?
