Subject: Please help my semi-camper my bus.

 
Is that how the &quot;Z&quot; bed works?  I have not seen one 
yet, just seen posts about them.  Did they make those in plain old vinyl seats?

--That is how the z-bed works and I believe you can buy a kit from gowesty! and others to convert your exist'g standard seat.


I would also like to have an AC outlet in my bus.  Now, the AC outlet from a  camper only operates when it’s powered by the campsite supply, right?

--Right

would like to take that further. I was thinking I could wire a small DC to AC inverter into the mix so that I could power things off of a 2nd deep cycle battery.  What I would like to know is if there is a way to power the AC outlet from the battery through an inverter while in motion or not connected to a campsite power supply, Is any of this stuff possible?

Yes, but you lose A LOT of efficiency going from DC to AC. My opinion and the vast majority of others on the list would be to go to DC powered equipment. You'll get a lot more from your power source. Those inverters that show 6 AC plugs coming off a car lighter are total B.S. Yeah, you can do it, for about 45 seconds.

Lastly, I like heat!  I am really not a big fan of the cold at all, and I will need some kind of heat in my bus while camping or sleeping in it.  What do you folks use to keep your tootsies warm on those cold winter nights?

--Lots of folks like gas heaters. I have no experience. But before going fossil fuel crazy, how 'bout this?
