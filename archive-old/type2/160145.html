Subject: Re: door latches 

I had this problem lately, I did this and the difference was night and day  
with my door locks: 

_http://type2_dot_com/rvanness/lock.htm_ (http://type2_dot_com/rvanness/lock.htm) 

I did the passenger side tonight. It really  is amazing the difference 
between a clean mechanism and a gritty, grimy, sticky  one. The lock opens like it 
should and the door handle is SO much easier to pull  and open. 

The spring that he talks about was actually there on that one.  It was just 
dirty. 

The hardest part for me on the 77 Westy, was getting  the door lock post that 
sticks up through the sill, that the plastic part screws  onto, into the 
proper place. Took several tries, but none the less, it was a  very worth while 
hour or 2 spent with the bus! 

Now just need to get that  drivers side done! 

Just curious why no one mentioned using silicone as a  lubricant in this 
application? I am not talking about the lock cylinder, but the  door latch. 
 
I found my info and posted on this link on the samba  maybe it will  help 
you?......
