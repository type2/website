&gt; Hi, I was wondering if the clutch cross shaft should have any movement in it
&gt; before it contacts stuff inside the tranny housing. Mine moves about half an
&gt; inch at the end before meeting resistance, which I assume means the throwout
&gt; bearing meets the clutch pressure assembly or maybe the shaft meets the TO
&gt; bearing. This seems normal if you consider that the clutch pedal has spring
&gt; loaded freeplay. The thing is I don't remember being able to move it last
&gt; time I replaced a clutch cable. Has anyone noticed if you can rotate the
&gt; clutch cross shaft by hand 1/2 inch? What is going on down there.

You might have a broken cluch lever return spring.  It lives between the
throwout lever and the transmission housing and they tend to break after
30 years or so of use.  To replace, you need to remove the clutch cable
from the lever, remove the snap ring that secures the clutch lever to the
cross shaft, pull the cross shaft, remove the remains of the spring.

Installation, as they say, is the reverse of these steps.  IIRC, you have
to pull the spring's hook over the lever as you slide the lever onto the
shaft.  Use lots of Liquid Wrench or whatever on the lever/shaft interface
before attacking it, as the two get frozen together rather easily.
