Subject: Fw: Gas tank size

I recently purchased a '68 VW bus that had been mothballed in someone's back
yard and inoperable for who knows how many years.  It now runs, but I have
looked everywhere to find the capacity of the gas tank so I could gauge the
mileage until the gages are replaced.  I would appreciate any assistance as
this is my first 'rebuild'.

Thanks

Susan Price
