John Connolly sends:

&gt; you had better run that thing and break it in before storage, unless you
&gt; like the idea of a complete teardown and reassembly before running (when you
&gt; return).

I've gone overseas a few times, and if I were getting ready to do it again
in one week with a new VW engine in my possession, I'd think really, really
hard about tearing the engine back down and coating all the parts with axle
grease, then putting it in a box with about five pounds of silica gel in
there.

When you return, you'll need a gallon can of mineral spirits to get all the
grease off, but you shouldn't find any rust in there.
