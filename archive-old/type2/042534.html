&gt; im sorry, i should have done this friday but im about to buy a 80 911 targa
&gt; as my new project car and ive heard of a 911 mailing list, does anyone know
&gt; where it is? This things in pretty rough shape, no engine no trans no top,
&gt; interiors trashed. Befor you reply ARE YOU NUTS, buying a junked one and
&gt; customizeing it is alot cheeper then buying a nice one and doing the same.
&gt; Dont worry, i'll still be around, not selling the bus.
&gt; 
&gt; ~72 bus (almost restored)

&gt; ~80 911 targa (on the way)
