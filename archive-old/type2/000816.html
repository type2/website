&gt;      Anyone have any input on the Pacesetter Extractor that Bus Depot
&gt;sells?

Harmon,
    If yours is a late 70's like my 77 and you are referring to the one
piece pacesetter exhaust that replaces everything behind the heater boxes,
then I think you will be disappointed as I am.  I just replaced a stock
exhaust with this unit and the fit was poor. The flanges are not far enough
apart to bolt onto the heater box flanges. I got it on with some muscling,
but I know it is stressing everything clear back to my newly rebuilt heads.
    By wrestling it on, the left heater box is now pulled against my oil
filter( I now cant use a stock filter because I cant get it on or off--I am
using the taller Rabbit filter and it rubs the box going on or off). Also,
the bottom sheet metal on the right side does not fit without a good
bend...again because the of the exhaust fit. The paint was gone after the
first trip around the block and now 2 weeks later it is rusting.
    Now, Ron says it is the best he has to sell, and others dont seem to
have anything better in a stock-appearing exhaust. Conclusion?  You can only
buy junk to replace a stock exhaust if you dont want one of those 4-tip
jobbies or a custom look. Personally I'd like to find a stainless exhaust
that is well built and stock looking. Sure it wouldn't cost $79.95 but I'd
pay the extra and it would be cost-effective!
Jay, 77 Westy

PS: For the record, I am not ripping Ron or Bus Depot here.
