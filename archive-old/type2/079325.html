Subject: Sewing - 

I got my mother's old Singer sewing machine a-working.  The belt is new, and 
this old treadle machine will stitch through just about anything I can get 
under its foot.

Now, here's a great source for material; WalMart!!

I picked up some solid vinyl for $3.77/yard, and some decent upholstery 
fabric for $4.97/yard.  Reasonable prices for end of role materials.  They 
had quite a few varieties of vinyl, and I picked up the solid, 
fabric-backing type of dark brown vinyl.

But I still cannot sew a straight line, so I plan to measure twice, cut 
once, and sew as many times as I need to get it right.  (seat covers, if you 
were curious..)
