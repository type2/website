Subject: Odd movement, a distributor question

Hello List,

I installed my distributor drive shaft today via
Bently. It went in smoothly. I then installed my
distributor. The drive dog engaged but I could still
rotate the rotor about 5 degrease. I then pulled the
distributor back out and held the drive dog still on
the dizzy while I tried to rotate the rotor. The rotor
shaft easily rotates about 5 degrease while the drive
dog stayed still. It didn't turn loosly, just springy.
Is this normal? Is this a bad sign? Is this a sign of
significant wear? Will it effect timing????

I am alittle nervous at this moment fearing the worst.
Any insight would be much appreciated. Thanks!

Have a great day!

David Kelly
