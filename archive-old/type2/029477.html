Well, the '80 has a complete set of guages... oil pressure, oil
temperature, nd cylinder head temperature.  The most sensative is the
cylinder head temp.  If you start up a hil, it starts to climb right along
with you.  Second, surprisingly, is oil pressure.  Oil temp is the lagging
indicator.

That the cyl head sensor would be the most sensative was not a shock... it
is metal to metal and right at the point of heat production.  The sensor
on my vanagon was constructed by John Anderson.  The sensor is the
standard Temp sensor II screwed in the #2 cylinder (I happen to have two
3-4 heads on the engine) run to a PC board and out to an '81 diesel foil
water temp guage above the clock. It had tyo be tode down a bit which we
did by running an LED inline (I would say ask John but he is, alas,
off-line :-(

The oil pressure leading the oil temp was not a shock once i thought about
it and saw a split T4 case at John's place.  Oil pressure is a direct
measure of oil temp at the pump and at the oil pressure sender hole.  The
hotter the oil, the lower the pressure. Oil temp on my engine is measured
in the base plate, but the dipstick sender winds up &lt; 1/2&quot; away from the
same spot.  I don't want to rehash the oil temp measuring the case vs.
measuring the oil etc., etc.  Both locations measure the oil temp in a
(relatively ) still pool outside the main sump.  The oil in that location
does not circulate as vigourously as the oil in the main sump and that oil
is probably very close to the temp of the case.  In any event...  It does
equilibrate with the sump temp eventially, but it does lag behind the oil
pressure, whichc is measuring temp at the pump and bearings.

If I had to choose only one sender...  I would choose oil pressure. When
all is said and done, this is the measure of how much oil is getting to
the bearings, and that is what is truly critical.  At 2000 RPM, if the
pressure is above 20psi I am happy, even if the oil temp is above 250, but
if the oil pressure is &lt;20, I do not care what the temp is!  I am
shutting that pup down!
