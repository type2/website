Subject: non pop-top westyes are rejected!!!

Hi everybody,

I just want to know if I am alone in my situation. In the region of 
Quebec and there is a club for westfalia. I make a demand to join the 
club. But I can't because my westie doesn't have a pop-top. But it's a 
real camper, every thing inside is original and I have the stickers westfalia.

I am no far from the idea to create a new club: the non pop-top club.
