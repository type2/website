Subject: electronic ignition -typeIV FI

So, I checked the archives and called my VWFLAPS and still can't seem to
get a strait answer.  Or maybe my thick skull has left little room for
mushy matter.  I want to put a compu-fire electronic ignition into my 77,
but I am worried that there will be some problem with the FI when the
points are taken out. Has anyone done this in their bus?  Not for any of
you 79 buses which I think had electronic installed originaly??

Thanks a bunch
