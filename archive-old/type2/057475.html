&gt;so , my question is, do I have to remove the wheel? Or can I just

I didn't have to remove the wheel of our 78 standard. In fact, leaving the
wheel on made it easier to rotate the hub to get better positions for the
socket wrench when loosening and tightening the CV bolts.

Helpful hints based on my experience of early this summer, removing,
cleaning, repacking, and reinstalling the left axle and CVs:

Make sure to
have the right size allen or other socket (depending on bolts) for getting
those CV bolts off,
use or buy a circlips pliers for the circlips (Sears has them for about
$15: worth every penny, and I did try the two-screwdriver trick, which
seemed to me primarily designed to accelerate my trip to insanity),
to get ALL (not just MOST) of the muck out of the hollow where wrench meets
bolt (they should shine),
to have the threads of the bolts thoroughly soaked in a penetrant of your
preference,
to use lots of grease (it's amazing how much grease the CVs &quot;absorb&quot;; I
found the little packets of grease included with the boots woefully
inadequate in quantity), and
to have immaculately clean work surfaces.

The use of plastic baggies around the greased CV joints up to the moment of
installation really helps. Also get ready to get REALLY greasy! But it's a
good greasy. :)

Good luck! And get your books back!
