Subject: vanagon belts? and Everybus

I do! I do! 

I was just saying to Steve this weekend that I need to post these belts
to the list so I can unload 'em on some worthy individual. They're very
nice; I pulled them off a Vanagon in a junkyard, and it wasn't a wreck.
The belts aren't sun-damaged either. I snagged all the hardware --
covers and everything. They're not 80s cuz the ones Steve's got on his
have little bitty short receiver ends and these are long metal bars. I
want to pass them along because I didn't realize until a couple of days
after I got them that I can't put bucket retractors in my bay -- I've
got a bench seat! So, they're yours, if you still want 'em.

I'm still slogging through my e-mails, and will post an Everybus trip
report as soon as I recuperate from 12 hours on a Southwest airplane.
They get my vote for least amount of leg room, and they neglected to
tell me about the stops in Jackson, Houston, and Vegas on the way back
to L.A. We were held over 2 hours in Vegas while L.A. got it together --
it's raining like, er, North Carolina here!
