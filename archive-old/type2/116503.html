Subject: neighbors suck/WT car circus

Yes pholks,

for those of you who don't know, having buttloads of beaters in the yard is not cool to the neighbors who have to share an eyesore with you as they come home everyday.

the problem with america (here I go) is that everyone's so busy screaming about what they're own rights are that we've forgotten that your rights end where your neighbor's begin.

I won't even get into the lost art of common courtesy.

I must be getting close to 30,

Billy

--------- Original Message ---------

&gt;&gt;Right now, I have in my front yard, a 1984 Pontiac &gt;&gt;Fiero, a 1987 Pontiac Fiero (Neither with up-to-&gt;&gt;date tags), and my GrandAm.
&gt;
&gt;As I read replies to this thread, I find myself &gt;asking if it's really such a bad thing to require &gt;people to NOT park cars in their front yard.  No &gt;offense, but I don't think I would want to live on &gt;your cul-de-sac.
