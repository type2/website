&gt; just bought a bus today 1971, westie, wasn't running but fantasic California 
&gt; body and general wear and tear, but I got it home and was going to jump it to 
&gt; se if I could get it running. I hooked up the cables on my truck then stuck 
&gt; them on the far cable in the bus then went to hook up the front one, giant 
&gt; spark, so I looked a little closer and noticed that the PO had bought a 
&gt; battery with the terminals on the wrong sides, the positive was near the back 
&gt; of the bus and the negative on the inside, so he must have just hooked up the 
&gt; cables without looking, so the cable leading to the starter was on the neg. 
&gt; and the ground cable from the body was on the pos. Does this sound wrong and 
&gt; what has been affected beside the starter that won't turn over now once I 
&gt; reset the cables. thanks.

I guess the best thing you can be thankfull for is that it isn't a FI
engine with the burned out ECU (which it would be)

  check each part one at a time, you could have damaged the Voltage
Regulator, maybe a few other parts but it should not be fatal damage
