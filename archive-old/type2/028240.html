Subject: Gorgeous Karman Ghia for sale

I'm posting this for a friend, she's selling her very pretty red 1968 
Kharman Ghia, it runs great, looks really beautiful too, the only problems I 
know of is some idiot stole the stereo and chopped the dash a little bit, 
and it got rear ended recently which slightly dented the butt (it was fixed, 
but traces remain).  It runs great, starts every time.  I think she's asking 
in the $2k range, she's in San Francisco, she put a little page together 
here:

You can contact her directly at julie_at_redsnail_dot_com.

Thanks.
