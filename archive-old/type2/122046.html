Hi David,

I'm not 100% certain about orange door panels, but I can assure you 
that in a stunning display of 1970's fashion sense (or lack thereof) VW 
did equip some orange westies with green door panels.

This actually works OK when you have the green plaid cloth seats, but 
it certainly would not have been my first color choice.

Happy trails,
