Subject: Manassas bug out this weekend

Anybody coming from Syracuse NY for the bug out??

I have a really nice mexico beige sliding door that I am trying to get to 
someone in Syracuse NY, and I would appreciate any p-mail offer of help.

Or else I am going to paint the door Sage Green and slap it on my '78!!
