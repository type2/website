Summer is almost over and I still don't have it working, but I'm making
progress.  My goal is to have it working before I leave for Jerome on Sept.
9th.  I'm fitting a rotary compressor in the engine compartment where the
air pump used to live and will be using refrigerant 134A.  The rest of the
system will be as DPD designed it.&gt;&gt;

I don't want to burst your bubble, but unless you have designed a new pulley
and mount to your fan, I would reconsider this.  I don't think the stock air
pump pulley bearing can take the stress put on it by an A/C compressor.   Also
where the pulley shaft mounts to your fan looks pretty light duty, and won't
handle much stress either.
