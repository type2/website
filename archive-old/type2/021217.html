Subject: Re: Bays vs Splitties--NOT!

Please let us not get into Bays vs Splitties--Both of these have a special place in our VW
Hobby--Some of you may not see very many Splitties on the road--But trust me--&quot;They Are
Out There&quot;
Dave Easterwood has driven across America to get to the Classic!! If you go to Bus Events
like
Buses by the Bridge--Jerome--OCTO-- you will see hundreds of  Splittie buses from all over
the States, Canada and Mexico--Each of these events can boast of totals of over 300+
Splitties!!!!
Here in Phoenix there are several Barndoor buses the on a regular basis go back and forth
to California.
It really should be Bays AND Splitties--As each one holds a special place in our Hobby--
Recently there has also been a Air vs Water thing going on as well inside the VW Hobby--
Again Both have a place in the VW hobby--VW is perhaps the only car company still in
existence
that has noble history of Air/Cooled cars--That is what makes Volkswagen so unique--The
heritage
of Air /cooled and now Water/ cooled--The heritage of Splittie and Bays and then the
Wedge--style of VW Buses--Splitties have been on the road going on 52+ years and I'm sure
they will continue to do so--In 2008 the The Bays will celebrate 40 years--And they as
well --will be going strong--In the Bay we see the progress VW made in improving the
Bus--In the Splittie we see the toughness of a VW Bus that will never die.  Also regarding
VW Bus shows--What &quot;Other&quot; make of transporter style vehicle can boast the attendance of
hundreds of transporters showing up? It only happens at VW Bus shows!!
The VW transporter is so far in front in 1st place---the 2nd place transporter almost does
not exist--
&quot;Keep on Truckin&quot;!! I think this was meant for the VW Type II-- What it means to All of us
as transporter drivers--Is that ALL VW buses are here to stay!! and will be On the Golden
Road&quot;
for as long there IS a Road!!
