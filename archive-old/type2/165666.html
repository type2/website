And here's a jaw-dropping twist: The owners, an affluent couple with
young children, plan to use this wonderful street-mauler to go to the
beach.

&quot;They have twins, and they needed seats for them and two nannies,&quot;

Further proof that rich != smart.  $110k for a bus that will haul
little kids to the beach.  A custom interior that sand will never
completely come out of.. in white, where the grape juice stains will
appear most vividly.  A corvette engine because we all drive 150MPH on
the Garden State Parkway to the beach in the Summer (standing traffic
be damned).  Interesting engineering marvel?  Sure.  Smart purchase
decision?  well... uh... not IMHO.
