Subject: Idle Speed after long run

Hey Volks,

Something I've noticed with both 34-Pict-3 and H30/31 Carbs (on my 
1600DP w/ Alt.)
is that when the engine is up to operating temperature, I'll stop at a 
stop sign or light
and the idle speed will drop below whatever it's been &quot;set&quot; at, say, 900 
RPM.  Usually,
just a tap to the accelerator pedal will bring the engine back to it's 
&quot;set&quot; idle speed.

Is this normal?

Why does this happen?

thanks,
	tom
