I have recently purchased a '71 bus. It was originally just a transporter 
but the PO did a fairly nice conversion...added the 2/3 fold out bed, a fold 
up table, jump seat, and closet down the passenger side. Unfortunately (and 
obviously), there is no pop-top. I suppose somebody out there has put a 
pop-top on a non-pop-top-bus but I'm not too intetrested in that...I have 
four kids and trying to wedge us all inside the bus is just out of the 
question.

I'm thinking that a tent/awning would be the best solution for me and 
somebody mentioned using a small trailer, which got me thinking. I'm 
picturing a trailer that would be compartmentalized with areas for storage,a 
propane stove, refridgerator/freezer, maybe even a fold-up shower of some 
sort. Sleeping space would be provided by the tent/awning so I don't think 
the trailer would have to be too large. Another advantage would be that you 
could leave it hooked up to power at your camp site while you drive around 
in the bus.

So(finally)my questions are these....
1. Anyone have much experience with trailer behind a bus? Is it feasible?
2. What do you think the weight/size limit should be? (I should mention that 
the bus has a 1600DP, mostly stock, but I 'hope' to put something in the 2.0 
range in.)
3. Has anyone built a trailer like this?

Any input would be appreciated!
Thanks
