They sell them at most FLAPS.  I bought one at Kragens a while ago and wish I hadn't.  It's extremely poor quality.  I didn't use it, but if I had I'm sure it would have done more damage than good.  There was were large burrs where the flutes were ground out.  I would have lost a good portion of the good threads had I used this piece or cr*p.
