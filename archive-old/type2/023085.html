Good analysis tommy, from what I can tell !
Engine pistons trying to compress fluid don't do too well.
Hydraliced, you say ? Wow ! (Dear Diary)

Karen, I'll bet your engine is still all OK, thanks to your staying alert.
Me as well, not to be too much on the manly side of things, but GOOD 
GIRL !

Just figure out why the gas keeps flowing, or flowing too excessively, 
and get that stopped, then the pistons won't be pushing against 
gasoline filled cylinder chambers.

As for the electric fuel pump, I'd go back to the original design, but 
others may differ on the thought. I just always worry if the dern 
electrical ones are turning on and off when they are supposed to do so, 
and if their output volume and pressure are proper.
