Subject: re Westy bedcovers

For our 78 Westy, I cut 2&quot; thick foam to fit both the lower bed and the
upper bed, and then made sewn 2 sided sheet covers for both.  Use
flannel on one side for cold weather use. The upper bed is rather stiff
and this helps increase the cushioning of 50++ yr old hips.  The lower
bedseat has &quot;depressions&quot; where the cushions meet, and the &quot;foam covers&quot;
even this out.  They are stored on the upper bed, simply left folded
out.  Good insulation to keep the heat in!  I believe there are pics
showing these (along with an exstra bed in the center of the van) on my
geocities web site, which I will give to interested parties, as it shuts
down with too many hits at once.
