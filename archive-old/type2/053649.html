Subject: Fathers Bus Day

Its my day and Ill get greasy if I want to.
So today I derusted the hatch window frame bottom and replaced the seal.
One man job, wire in the channel silicone sprayed the frame, no prob. 
Replaced the shocks with Rons boge(techum) cheapies. Hey those
front lowers really dont fit without some serious grinding, way too wide.
Replaced a leaky rear wheel cylinder and adjusted all 4 brakes. The last
time I did the brakes I used generous anti-sieze and they were still
smooth and easy to adjust.
A very good fathers day. Hope all yours were too.
cheers.
