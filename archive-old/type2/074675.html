Agreed.  Speed is not my thing...or I wouldn't drive a
60 hp box on wheels.

&gt; They also speak of longevity. You can build 3 Type I
&gt; motors for the cost of a Type IV. Parts for the Type
&gt; I
&gt; are abundant in Mexico. Type IV parts are non
&gt; existant. 

Right.  Also important in other third world countries,
like West Virginia.  I doubt there is a new TypeIV
cylinder head at a parts place anywhere in this entire
state.  Most of the VW shops have a few new 1600 dual
ports on the shelf.  Other important Type I parts a
similarly in stock.
