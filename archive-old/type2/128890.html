&gt;Thanks to all for the multiple responses!  Sounds like we have some
&gt;differences of opinion (or memory)  :-)

I sent the VIN cutoff number in my previous email.

&gt;Anyone with a 78 willing to take a picture of the bottom of their seat &amp;
&gt;tracks so I can compare to my 76?

BTW, when I did my seats I could never find the sisal padding that went
between the cushion and the seat material so I reused it.  At the time, what I
located was always for carpets and too thick. I was at OSH the other day and
found some felt made from reclaimed fibres (like the original) in a suitably
thin size.
