We'll be close to the phone this afternoon/evening.

I'm in Cookeville and ready to help if need be.


&gt;Chris, and others along I-40 from Nashville east to Raleigh, NC;
&gt;
&gt;I got an AIRS call yesterday afternoon from Josh Thorp, also on the AIRS 
&gt;list, who's traveling, with  his almost three year old daughter, from El 
&gt;Paso to Raleigh for a new job. When he got to my little town along 40 his 
&gt;'70 dropped a valve seat on number three.
&gt;
&gt;He correctly diagnosed his ailment and called me from a rest area. I was 
&gt;able to find him a used head and he spent last night and today R/R the 
&gt;head in my driveway. He'll be leaving Dickson, 40 miles west of BNA, in a 
&gt;couple of hours he hopes. Please watch/listen for him. Great young man, 
&gt;and an aircooled afficianado since his early teens.
