Hi,

&gt; &gt; Err, this is a bit unfair, if I may say so. He'd only just bought

&gt; That was information not provided. Had it been, this is the responce.

Sure it was: the first three lines in the message were:

:: My first journey...
:: 
:: I had an eventful time bringing my newly purchased bus back home. 

&gt; DM says inspect the vehicle before you buy it.
&gt; It takes 2 minutes to look at the belt and pop off the cap.

Yes, but you should also check the brakes, the fuel pipes, the steering
and suspension and so on. When another listee posted a question on what
to check under precisely these circumstances he was offered a longish
list of items to look over. Howard was only intending to drive a little
over 50 miles and had no reason to think that the bus was not
roadworthy.

 Your point is valid but perhaps not always realistic.

&gt; I am the one who must maintain my community reputation for GETTING
RESULTS.
&gt; I will always endeavor to improve, not compromise, what I know by
&gt; experience works. First premise at my shop: My clients will never be
&gt; found at the side of the road waiting for a tow truck to another shop
&gt; because the results were lacking at mine.

 It's a pity that the PO of Howard's bus didn't use a similarly 
concientious mechanic.

Cheers,
	W.
