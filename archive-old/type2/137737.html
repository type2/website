Hi Don,

Gerald sounds right on. If nothing he suggested checks out, I'd say
you have a dangerous wiring short situation that could cause a fire if
not found. With your battery discharging so fast, you may already have
melted wire insulation that needs to be found.

I don't remember what year your bus is, but on earlier models, you
could remove the hot wire from the coil and run a direct jump from
battery to coil positive and drive temporarily on that. Don't think
you can get away with it on fuel injected models.

 Now that I&quot;m more relaxed and have a few Cap'n &amp; Cokes in me, I'm
 thinking more clearly. . . heh  What is the possibility of me having
 shorted a wire while messing with the wipers and blowing either the
 regulator or the goodies in the alternator? (I've got this image of a
 burned out diode or bridge rectifier in my head that won't leave...)
 The only thing that keeps me from being sure is the fact that I *do*
 get dash lights under some conditions. Many of my tests were done with
 the Volvo running and jumper cables attached. So I definitely had
 current available. But something's sucking it up...
