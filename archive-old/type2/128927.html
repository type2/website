&gt; If the idiots get their way, what happens to all the cars that got the
&gt; &quot;shaft&quot;????

They migrate east... Woohoo!!!

&gt; will this mean an influx of VW's to &quot;non smog&quot; areas????

Probably. And they'll bring their cursed 1976-78 exhaust with them, 
too. :-(

&gt; And on a related note what does this mean for the rest of the VW world 
&gt; as a
&gt; whole???

Not much, since we're only talking about 76-79 buses.

&gt; Will all the Cal. Based shops/suppliers be run out of business???

Buses have been out of production in Germany for 25 years already, 
those shops should do OK for a while yet.

&gt; Will all the junk yards/used parts vendors start crushing VWs due to 
&gt; the
&gt; &quot;loss&quot; or perceived loss of the California market???

Not any more so than what they do already.

&gt; Am I just being paranoid??

Yup.

Happy trails,
