&gt;&gt;And that vacuum assist is frivolous?  I'm curious.

&gt;Not if it came with your van - if it came stock fire it up!   But please
&gt;don't strip other buses to retrofit acessories
&gt;on to busses that didn't come with them. This kills buses and is bad
&gt;karma.

AHA!  That's the problem.  It's the '71 engine, trans and Westy stuff that
are screwing up my bus!

I guess it would've been better off with a nonexistent '69 engine, '69
trans with no 4th gear, and a dearth of Westy gear.  My mistake.

Anyhow, everyone knows that dual ports are useless, doghouse oil coolers
are a fascist plot, and disc brakes are satan's spawn.  Hence the
screwed-up karma. 

What's that smell? Fresh sarcasm?
