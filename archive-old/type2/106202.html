Subject: Just picked up my new Bus....

Ok...

	Well, after comming to grips with the fact that I bought a
Volkswagen.. :) something I thought I'd never do.. heh. I finally got my
1973 Volkswagen Bus back home. I've spent the past 2 days working on the car
since I've gotten it. Basically.. long story short, the BUS has a brand new
GEX 1.8 liter engine. The motor has less than 20 miles on it. The BUS also
has a COMPLETELY new paint job... sort of a light blue body, with a white
top (from the dew strip gutter thing to the top is white).

BUT... the car's been sitting in storage for about 3 years. The car also was
completely disassembled... nothing was hooked up except the dash... all the
windows, seats, everything was haphazardly thrown into the back. I spent the
greater part of yesterday installing the windows and stuff. I had JUST
enough gaskets to completely reassemble the windows in the front doors, the
windows / vent on the commando door, and the vent / window on the door
adjacent to it. All these gaskets were new. Oh yeah, I also was able to
re-install the defog window in the rear. 

However, I am completely missing the gasket for the rear passenger side
window. To make things a little difficult, all four of the big windows had
the vent option. The brackets and metal that the vent window sit in are
completely rusted through... definately unrepairable. So that brings me to
my first question...

!-) Does anyone on here have for sale a vent window for the rear drivers
side, and the rear passenger side? I have the glass, but I need everything
else... from the gasket to the hardware to the brackets.


The next thing is... I'm trying to replace a lot of the items that look
&quot;old&quot;. I want to replace all the chrome on the car... I'm thinking of
getting a whole new set of door locks, and the trunk-hatch door handle, as
well as the commando door handle.
I also want to get replacement hub caps as well. I noticed that prices are
VERY reasonable.. much cheaper than they are for purchasing items for my
Pontiacs.

I did find one place on the net.. Wolfsberg West or something... do you guys
know any other stores that might sell parts for busses?


Also, not sure what exactly is happening.. but I charged the battery and
hooked it up. The motor doesn't start. Actually.. it doesn't even crank. The
headlights and HAZARD lights work. The turn signal lights don't.. and when I
turn on the hazards.. there's some guage over to the left with an R  -  1/2
-  1/1  and the needle jumps. What exactly is that guage? R???

What are some things I can check? The motor is brand new... but I'm
wondering if it hasn't been hooked up yet.




Thanks,
