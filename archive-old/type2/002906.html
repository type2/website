&gt; Todd and everyone else too,
&gt;    You probably will have a hard time finding zinc chromate primer.  It's
&gt; not used anymore due to the fact that the ingrediants are not very healthy


Zinc chromate primer is still quite available in the airplane world.
Try: www.aircraftspruce_dot_com   or

       www.wicksaircraft_dot_com

I have used an epoxy primer that has zinc chromate in it. It works well ,but
you still need to eliminate any rust both mechanically and chemically.
