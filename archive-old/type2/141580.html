Subject: Re: [T2] Why would I get tight valves on 1E, 2E, &amp; 4E?

the NGK suffix of a # is simply a pre-set gap. Since we change them to our
gap (you ARE going to at least check it right?), it doesn't matter. Plug
gaps can change just by the shipping gorillas tossing boxes on/off the UPS
truck, so check/set them.

Just change the gap to suit your application, it only takes 30 sec per plug
with the $1 tool from your FLAPS.
