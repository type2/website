Subject: RE: [T2] The MicroBus is out! Guess who has one. Color a bit of
  a problem...

I saw the barbie &quot;new microbus&quot; at walmart about a month ago... I was
tempted... but couldn't bring myself to get a barbie... ;)


Has anyone else noticed this:

I was driving the other day and got behind a late model VW Golf GTI. The
rear hatch of the GTI looks exactly the same as the front of the new
microbus... just smaller. Where the taillights are on the GTI is where the
headlights are on the new microbus.....

how crappy is that... they should have just called it the &quot;new, alkwardly
shaped, oversized, backwards GTI&quot;

or we can just drive the GTI in reverse all day...


honestly...there is more GTI in the new bus than there is old bus, IMHO.
