Subject: Re: thump thump thump

&gt;my 77 camper made a very loud (you could kinda feel it) thump
&gt;thump thump! all the way home from work last time I drove it.

All will be revealed when the wheel falls off and goes rolling across the
median. Quite a surprise at 60, I bet. 8)

Very likely it is loose lug nuts, possibly loose axle nut, they both thump
like that. You really should not drive that bus until you've ruled these
out.
