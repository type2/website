SIGHTING #1: There's a 76 (gas station) ad out there
with your sterotypical elderly lady driving an old gas
guzzler on the road. It turns into her racing on a
track with all sorts of vehicles - one of which is a
baywindow bus sterotypically painted with flowers. It's
real quick and you'll miss it if you don't pay
attention.

SIGHTING #2: In a new MasterCard TV ad, there is a
white over red ('64(?) to '67 fried egg
signal, wide rear cargo hatch) 21 Window Deluxe. The
commercial is one of those &quot;Baseball Tickets:
$48.00...&quot; -  priceless things. Strangely enough, it
didn't have VW  emblem on the front or the script on
the back... must have been that VW crackdown.
Nonetheless, it is a very fine example in an ad, as
they show it from almost every angle. Probably will add
to current splitty prices, too...
