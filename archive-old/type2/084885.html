Subject: Re: [T2] air conditioning

Probably not a difficult project with some time spent on examining modern 
dual a/c vehicles. Probably would simply require the coils and blower from 
a smaller car and would require the compressor to run more to keep pressure 
in the system.

Might be something I look at eventually. My wife doesn't even think we need 
any a/c in our bus.

&gt;Chris,

&gt;Underdash unit keeps driver and passenger cool.
&gt;
&gt;Overhead helps keep passengers in the back cool also.
&gt;
&gt;Before I left, they were developing dual &quot;executive&quot; units with aan
&gt;overhead in the front and back.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;No experience with those so I won't comment.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And why would an underdash system be any worse than a VW ceiling 
&gt; mounted unit?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Either way it is a set of coils in a plastic case.
