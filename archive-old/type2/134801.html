Subject: Camping Heat

We have one of these, and they are excellent for quick direct heat, and they
can really warm your van up quick.

The one we have has an anti-tilt cut off, so if you do knock it over it cuts
out. I have noticed that it warms up and cools down very quickly, so I don't
think you run much risk of setting fir to your self.

I think I read too many messages and get confused...

Just Campers have an offer on Halogen heaters and I fancy some warmth while
camped:
