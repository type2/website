&gt;I got a battery &quot;hold-down&quot; from BD and can't figure out how it goes on.  It's just a top piece.  On my tray is a hole with an angled nut/bracket below.  Is there a long angled threaded post that goes from bottom to top?
&gt;thanks all, -Chris

There is a bolt that threads into the nut in the battery tray and holds the clamp to the battery.
