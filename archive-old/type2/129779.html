&gt;My '78 campmobile won't start.

&gt;The engine turns over. If I push open the flap in the airflow meter, fuel 
&gt;circulates. All fuses in the fuse box are intact.
&gt;
&gt;After turning over the engine my coil was pretty warm to the touch, so I 
&gt;checked the spark from the coil. It appears I have no spark. I thought the 
&gt;coil must be the problem so I installed a new one. Evidently the coil 
&gt;wasn't the problem. Still no spark.
&gt;
&gt;Any ideas? Thanks.

I bought a '73 (I think it was a 73) from a guy cheap, it wouldn't start 
(it had seats for 9 and a good bit of rust). He was getting ready to pull 
the engine and ran out of enthusiasm. He &amp; a friend had disconnected 
everything they could find on the engine &amp; stopped when I bought it.
After I figured out where everything went I tried to start it, cranked but 
no start.
I checked the condenser... as I recall with the points closed, power on use 
something to push the points apart. A weak little spark is good a bright 
heavy spark is bad.
It had a bad condenser, put a new one on &amp; it fired up and ran well.
