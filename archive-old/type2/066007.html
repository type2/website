You are among several who have posted that it's illegal to retrofit old 
vehicles w/ smog devices. I assume this is just in CA? Do you know if it 
also applies if a later model engine was retrofitted, one that 
originally came w/ these devices installed? I seem to recall, a number 
of years ago, articles mentioning fitting 'converters into street 
rods... but that may be a thing of the past.
