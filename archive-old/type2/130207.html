&gt;Anyone know where I can get a new pair of valve cover bails for my 78 
&gt;westy?  I looked at busdepot but I couldn't find any.

I bought some at Bus Boys. I had no idea how badly pitted mine were until I saw a pair of new ones. It's really amazing how a new set of covers and bails will eliminate the oil leaks without the need for chemicals.
