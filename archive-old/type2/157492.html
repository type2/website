Subject: Re: [T2] Stall when braking

If you don't have a checkvalve and had a backfire,
that could do in the diaphragm. Unless the idle is
already too low due to other issues... and using the
booster is just enough additional vacuum &quot;leak&quot;
(usage) to kill the motor. As I recall, the hose end
at the booster moves with every application, right? If
this is so, there could be a break in the hose right
up front there that is opening up when you step on the
pedal. -BaH

&gt; Buy a check valve, because I don't think I have one,
&gt; and thats a bad 
&gt; thing too
&gt; I will try bloacking the line
&gt; Then check the booster hose
