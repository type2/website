Subject: need air flow meter for 79 bus

Hi all:

My mechanic tells me the air flow meter on my 79 AFC fuel injected bus is
defective and needs to be replaced.   A new one is too expensive, and he
hasn't been able to find a used one. I thought I'd try the list.

Does anyone have a functioning air flow meter he or she'd be willing to part
with, for a price?
