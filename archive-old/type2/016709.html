&gt;  I heard someone talking
&gt; about a
&gt; type 4 motor they had installed into there bus.  Pleas excuse me for being
&gt; a novice, but what exactly is the difference between a type II motor and a
&gt; type 4 and why would someone want to replace the stock motor with a type
&gt; II.  Please if anyone could email back on this subject or give me info on
&gt; were to look.  Also, if this is not a legitimate type message for this
&gt; email service please tell me so I won't error again.
Biagio:
This is a perfectly legit question for this list, and let me be the
first to say: Welcome to the ranks of loaf owners and I'm glad you're
here! 
Type 2's from 1972-1979 that were imported into the US (and I beleive
Canada as well as some European Type 2's) had the same basic engine as
the Type 4 and Porsche 914 and 912e. There were detail differences such
as lower compression ratios, different FI or carburetion systems,
different oil fills,  breather hoses, and exterior sheet metal. I
installed a 1.7 type 4 engine in a 78 bus once because the original 2.0
liter engine had burned all its exhaust valves. I drilled and tapped the
blanked off oil fill opening on the type 4 motor, changed all the
accesories and FI system and the type 4 motor worked quite gloriously
for several years. I did this because I had the type 4 engine readily
available and I could do the work immediately without having the car out
of service for very long (it was my wife's daily driver so I had this
motivation, you see...)
