Subject: RE: [T2] Warning buzzer for lights

Great, Bart.  I also replaced my key-in-lock-and-door-open buzzer with 
another Radio Shack ding-dong alert.  I can live with the ding-dong, but not 
the OEM buzzer.

Here's another hint for you: set the points dwell in three minutes with a 
simple set of three wires and screwdriver.  All from the back of the bus.

I have a house front door bell switch. The kind that you push ring the 
doorbell.    One end of the switch goes to the battery's positive terminal 
(with a long wire, and small battery clamp, of course) and the other end has 
two wires going out.  One wire goes to the starter solenoid (actually, to 
the wire that you layed from the starter solenoid into the engine 
compartment) and the other wire goes to the ignition coil.

Put your digital dwell meter on the coil &amp; ground it, then push the door 
bell button and see the dwell reading.


With this contraption, all you have to do is remove the distributor cap, 
remove the distributor rotor, and loosen the points hold down screw.  You 
can hold the door bell button on and the engine will rotate and give you a 
dwell reading, and all the while you are adjusting the points with the other 
hand.  Get the dwell in the 48-50 range and you are done.  OK, tighten the 
screw and put the rotor and cap back on..


Absurdly simple...  Now, why didn't I think of that (someone else did.  
Credit is due to someone else out there in type 2 land).

Of course you have a wire coming from the starter solenoid into the engine 
compartment so you can kick the engine over to basically check the dwell 
while you have the distributor cap/ rotor off, right??  And to do the hot 
start deal.

But the old way, you were probably turning the key on (to read the dwell) 
and off (to adjust the dwell) each time to get a reading.  No, you say you 
already HAD a cheater wire that went from the battery to the coil, and that 
supplied the power to the distributor to get the dwell reading, and you took 
it off each time you stuck your screwdriver in to make another points 
adjustment??

And you say you WERE using the starter solenoid-to-battery wire to get 
engine rotation.  But you just did not go the final step to hook in a switch 
so you could handle everything with one hand.

Well, there are only SMALL steps and MEDIUM sized steps; the BIG steps are 
really a  TRIP!!
