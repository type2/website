It's very important to reinstall the plastic barrier or to replace it with
new plastic if the old plastic is shot. Be sure that the plastic slips down
inside the door opening like the stock plastic does. The inside of the door
is a surprisingly wet place. It's not just vapor that is the problem. Water
actually drips in there during a heavy rain (even with new window seals).

About 5 years ago when I put speakers in the doors, I didn't replace the
plastic in one door and sure enough, when I took the panel off recently, the
panel was deteriorated  on the bottom half where there was no plastic.
