&gt;    Greetings listees, I disassembled the case before removing my fan pulley
&gt;hub.  I have been unsuccessfully attempting Muir's method of tapping round
&gt;and round.  With a block of wood as a dampener, I have hit it hard enough
&gt;with a hammer, to totally gouge and splinter the wood.  I would use a three
&gt;armed harmonic puller, as Tom Wilson directs, but I don't have one.  Does
&gt;anyone know other methods? Can I use heat?  As always, any help would be
&gt;appreciated.  Thanks, Pete

Didn't we just address this one recently?  I tried a three-arm puller and
all it did was bend the ears on the hub.  Ended up letting the machine shop
remove it.  I suppose a three arm puller might work, if you're luckier than
me, or if you made a good strong ring to bolt to the hub and pull on.
