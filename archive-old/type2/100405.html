Subject: top speed

  What seems strange to me, and a little funny, is that when these things 
were new, I think many people just drove them.  They did not wait 15 minutes 
to warm up, and I am sure they all did not drive them under 65.  Back in the 
day, this was just another van.  Getting beat on like any other.  Now I 
absolutely agree that pushing a 1600 over 65 is not a good idea.  And I also 
am ritualistic about warming her up.  But what of the people who just drove 
these things?  Were there as many problems with the engines back then?  I 
alas was not old enough to drive one when it was new, or be into busses that 
much then to find out.
I mean, there was a time when these things were not icons.  Just regular 
vans.  And if you drove one of these like a Chevy.... Well...
And some peole still do treat them like Fords or Chevys!
  I will never forget the time I was talking to a head on tour.  He told me 
he has had three busses, and that they always break down.  I asked how he 
was traveling, and what with.  8 people, and a 71 westie loaded to the gills 
with camping stuff!  Can you say hot!!!!!!
I also wondered why if he has had three, and they all broke down, would he 
want another?   Just saw The Other Ones in Boston, and I was happy to see 
many of the younger crowd driving Fords, and Chevys.  I mean, if your 
pushing like that, don't kill a piece of Art!!!!     BG
