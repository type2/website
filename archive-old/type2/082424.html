Subject: RE: [T2] '78 Bus FI troubleshooting - only runs on cold-start after engine swap

I just went through this myself (put a 78 engine in my 79.)  There
should be a wire from the + side of the coil (terminal 15) going to =
terminal
86c on the relay.  This wire provides power to the relay, and if
I remember correctly, controls the switching of power to 88b.  There =
should also
be a wire from the coil (terminal 15 again) to the fan relay, which
in turn gets juice from the ignition switch (I'm a little foggy on this
part as my PO had removed the fan ran the ign wire straight to the =
coil.)

So, to summarize, turn on the key, test power to terminal 15 of the
coil (+ side) and if that is good, check power to terminal 86c on the
double relay.  I'm willing to bet this is where the problem is.

&gt; I tried following the Bentley book in testing the double=20
&gt; relay. The relay seems to have positive in the right place=20
&gt; when the key is off. With the key on, it does not seem to=20
&gt; energize 88b as it is supposed to. Also, we are supposed to=20
&gt; check for presence of ground on 85, but what seems to be=20
&gt; labeled 85 doesn't seem to have a pin long enough to check=20
&gt; (or I am checking it and it isn't showing ground). This was=20
&gt; all working with the old engine, so I don't think the relay=20
&gt; is bad. Also we tried another relay that Lou says is &quot;known=20
&gt; good&quot; and it didn't work either.
&gt;=20
&gt; I'm thinking that maybe wherever the signal goes into the=20
&gt; relay to switch-on 88b is where the fault is, but I don't=20
&gt; understand from the wiring diagram where I should be=20
&gt; checking. The switched positive from the keyswitch up front=20
&gt; must run back somewhere, through someting and eventually to=20
&gt; an unknown pin on the double relay. I think I should be=20
&gt; working backwards from the where this signal comes into the=20
&gt; relay, but I don't see where to check.
&gt;=20
&gt; Any guesses what we didn't hook up right? Any suggestions on=20
&gt; any of this in general?
&gt;=20
&gt; Thanks much!
