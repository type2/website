&gt; OG keys are chrome plated steel, at least the few that I have that look

My R profile keys are made by Neiman. I know there were several key mfgrs
that VW used. HUF, HK, AKS, Kolb to name a few.

I recently found this original key with code matching my door locks:

It was found in a large box of old keys at my dad's house and I think it was
a victim of galvanic corrosion but it was stored inside for 20 years.
