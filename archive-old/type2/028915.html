Subject: RE: [T2] Length?

Hello Brian,

Just happen to have a (slightly battered) thermostat to flaps rod for a
1600cc engine in the cupboard...

If you take the rod and look straight on at the top end then you will see
something like this (if you are not viewing this mail in 'plain text mode'
then copy it into your word processor and select a non-proportional type eg
Courier New in Windows)

	o
	 \
	  \
	   |
	   |
	   |
	   |
	   |
	   |
	   |
	   |
	   |
	   |
	    \
	     |
	     |

The &quot;o&quot; in the picture is the end of the rod

The length of the section coming straight is 22mm
The upper cranked section is 20mm long and is at an angle of about 45
degrees to the long section and at right angles to the part of the rod
pointing towards you.
The long straight section is 160mm long.
The lower cranked section is at an angle of about 30 degrees and is 25mm
long.
the lower section including the treaded section is 15 mm.
In the view show above it is 215mm from top to bottom.

Now looking straight on at the lower end of the rod it looks like this
	  _____
	 /     |
	o      |
	       |

This shows that the lower crank is angled at about 45 degrees to the section
which fits into the flaps the other end.

All of this suggests that there will be a fair amount of trial and error in
achieving good fit and operation.

Good luck

Sorry to ask another weird/stupid question so soon...

Does anyone know the working length of the small rod that connects the
thermostat to the flaps on a 1600 doghouse cooler?  The one I have has been
pretty badly mangled and after straightening (not the 90 degree bend on the
flap end or the slight offset bend by the thermostat) it out it is now too
long. (the thermostat will not fit in the bracket unless the bracket is
totally off it's stud)

Thanks for the help and/or suggestions once again.  I should be back on the
road once I get this and my carb plug figured out...
