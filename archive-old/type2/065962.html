Subject: flaps in the fan housing

When I removed my fan housing during my rebuild of my '77 2L there were 
little flaps at the bottom of the housing where it connects to the heat
exchangers.  These flaps (made of thin aluminum) were all broken up so I 
left them off.  Now I worry about their purpose?  Since they are not
connected to any kind of control I assume they are just one way valves
that allow heat to go from you fan to the heat exchangers but not vice-versa.
Is this true?  Under what circumstances does air flow from the heatexchangers
to the fan?  Is there a problem with leaving them off (should I pull the
fan housing and fix it)?
