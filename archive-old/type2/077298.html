Mass production is the main problem with mail order engines.... we don't do
it that way...we are more like a local shop, that will build the engine and
ship it to you.....

Most of our customers ship their engines to us, to be built......

&gt; Hi Matthew,
&gt;
&gt;    You may or may not do OK with Bus Depot. As you know, they use AVP
&gt; engines. I recently installed one of their engines purchased through Bus
&gt; Depot. The engine runs well. I have run into two problems so far. One of
the
&gt; pushrod tubes was leaking. I solved that problem with silicon applied to
the
&gt; outside on the ends. Then I had a valve lash problem that was causing a
&gt; tapping noise. Tightening that valve seems to have solved the problem.The
&gt; jurry is still out though. I'll have to keep an eye on it. I had to
tighten
&gt; it a seemingly large amount. During these problems I found that Bus Depot
&gt; would argue with me . Bus Depot's initial brush off was that the warranty
&gt; does not cover engines not installed by a certified mechanic.AVP would
&gt; sometimes respond and sometimes not respond. (the answering machine always
&gt; answers)On the other hand, I find that I can get Lennard at AVP on the
phone
&gt; and he does try to help out . He is willing to talk at length if you want.
&gt; Many times I wished that I had just gone with a local builder with a good
&gt; rep and paid the extra money. That way I could have just driven it down
&gt; there and had them deal with the problems.
&gt;     Some other thoughts: If you go the mail order route you probably will
&gt; not get the same level of service.Another thought I had was maybe it would
&gt; have been better to just buy directly from AVP. Bus Depot charges your
&gt; credit card immediately for the core charge and then takes about two
months
&gt; to refund your money after you return the core.A major considertion is the
&gt; time it takes to do all of the installation work. The amount you spend on
&gt; the engine starts to be less and less of an issue if you value your time
&gt; highly. Even if a mail order company honors a warranty , you will still
have
&gt; to redo all of that work.
&gt;      I had the tranny rebuilt locally and I'm glad I did.
&gt; Good luck to you ,
&gt; Neil Sundberg
