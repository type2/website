&gt;Hey! All
&gt;This is my First post and i'm a newbie to VW 
&gt;I have a 76 Loaf with a siezed starter motor.
&gt;a new Bosch is $100. one from my FLAP is $60.
&gt;I can't shell out the scratch for the Good one, and i don't trust the cheap
&gt;one.
&gt;SO can my old 722 Bosch starter motor be rebuilted? and how difficult is the
&gt;process of rebiulting it?       Thanks   Gary VW
&gt;

Costs about a $100 time/money to actually do it right by anyone who
actually knows how. If your a manual tranny, spend $50 more and get the
SR17X which is stock for the automatics. Much more robust motor. An
approved alternative for the T-IV motor and also stock on the 911 Porsche,
so you know it's been proven at LeMans. 911's don't need extra relays to
keep the starter starting. The cheapest motor you can by when time/money
per mile with no problems is controlling. Beg/borrow or steal the money to
do it right and you'll have the money you need when you retire. Cheap out
and you lose all your life by paying a premium for unnecessary redo's and
repairs, and end up in retirement with a pittance.

Get a junk yard motor for now and save your nickles till you have enough to
do it right. It will be a much smaller loss than the FLAPS loss leader
junk, if not for sure, at least to a 2 sigma certanity.
