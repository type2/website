Subject: Lowering (Was:Re: questions/for sale)

Hi Paul,

&gt; I fitted an adjuster to my camper, its lowered about 3&quot; and it looks 
&gt; completely level now, quite subtle, just about noticeable (if you saw it
&gt; before). Since it's level, not nose-up, the non-VW world just think it's
&gt; okay and don't give you a second glance.

 This is what I'm considering doing to mine- I'd like to level it off by lowering the front a little instead of returning the rear to stock height- I don't want a low-look, just a level bus but I don't need the stock ground clearance and would like a tad lower CG, less overall height etc.

&gt; PS If you need any advice/tips on the job, pmail me and I'll give you some
&gt; detailed advice. I believe there is a good article in the library, but my
&gt; article has a few noteworthy points to add to this.

 I'd like to see that, too, if you wouldn't mind.

&gt; Are you planning to lower the rear as well?

 Time and load have already achieved this for me!

 Cheers,
                W.
