Subject: My next gas problem
Date: Tue, 26 Jun 2001 11:25:59 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Now that I have the gas overflow problem fixed, I think I have another
related problem. 

Immediately after the overfilling of the gas tank my camper starts to
backfire when I decelerate and will not idle. It was running fine and then I
decided to put some STP gas treatment in the tank to help clean out anything
in the engine. I put the gas treatment in the tank, overfilled the tank and
went on my merry way. As soon as I needed to decelerate, I started getting
the backfiring and if I tried to stop without giving it some gas it would
stall. I looked in the archives and everybody says that backfiring is a sign
of an exhaust leak, but it only started after the STP and the overfilling.
It only backfires when you decelerate. It seems to idle okay when you first
start it up, but once it is warm is when it will not idle.

Any suggestions or things I can check tonight? I have already changed the
fuel filter, it was full of junk, but it did not improve things. The STP gas
treatment maybe changing the characteristics of the gas??

Thanks again for the help,
Corbett
