Justin,

From your description - your engine is oscillating - not the vehicle. Sounds
like you may have a broken motor mount - or perhaps your rear tranny mount
bolts are missing?

'77 Westy

&gt;&gt; My 78 Westy, recently brought back from the mechanically dead, sat
inactive
&gt;&gt; for nearly four years.
&gt;&gt; Her shocks were hosed before she died, and I imagine the coma did nothing
to
&gt;&gt; help them.
&gt;&gt; Now running, when I hit smallish ridges in the road (read: any GA
highway)
&gt;&gt; at speed, she starts bucking until I clutch-in and back out.  If I go
over,
&gt;&gt; say, a railroad track at less than 15mph, no problem.  But those bumps
are
&gt;&gt; killing me - and presumably my clutch.
&gt;&gt; Is this a shock problem, or indicative of some needed adjustments?
