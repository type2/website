Hi folks,

I am building a 2.0 litre out of a 78 van. The FI system is complete and for
sale. It sells as a unit. Let me know exactly which pieces you require, as I
am a carburated person and don't know jack about FI systems.

I think $250 is appropriate. Also need to know where the brain is on this
one and any other vital parts. Educate me.

Matt
