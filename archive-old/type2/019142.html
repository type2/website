Re splitting the case-
   It's been a while since I split my 71 case (the current 78 Westy is
still puttering fine at almost 211,000mi now!
I do remember that I bolted something across the studs (a board with
holes drilled into it), and used that as a surface to tap against to add
some force to pulling.  With 2 frinds pulling on the studes and you
tapping on the case corners, it should also come apart.  MB
