&gt; Hello, fellow VW fans,
&gt; 
&gt; I am currently going through this with a '74 bus I am trying to get up to
&gt; California smog standards.  I was told by the 'smog referee' at the state
&gt; office that if I could find a '78-'79 engine, the bus would then need the
&gt; smog gear for that particular year.  However, I was also told that I could
&gt; NOT put an older engine in and use the smog gear for that engine.

&gt; PS: Is the Bob Hoover I keep reading about the same Bob Hoover I remember
&gt; watching as a kid up at the EAA Flyin, doing spectacular aerobatics in
&gt; various planes?      
- --       You know? I remember my Dad either talking about him or hearing 
about him at Oskosh Flyin.
