Andrew,

There is no difference.  The &quot;flat&quot; DP 1600 is an upright or Type 1 engine with
cooling fan similar to the Type 3.  In fact the upright and flat 1600 Type 1
engine originated in the Type 3.

However, you should note that this engine was never marketed by VW in North
America, where a flat 4 always refers to a Type 4 engine.

----------
: What is the difference between an up-right, Flat4 &amp; Pancake? In
: England I have a DP 1600 &quot;flat4&quot; is this the same as an up-right?
