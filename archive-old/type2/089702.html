Subject: Re: [T2] T2b front end needs stiffening?


In a message dated 6/30/02 7:50:04 AM, tigger_at_neale_dot_org writes:

&lt;&lt; Anyway, the only reason for this piece of pipe welded to the front beam is 
to stiffen it up, does anyone know of any problems in the late models ('79), 
or trucks which would account for needing to stiffen up the front end? OR, 
does anyone know ( or can guess ) what it would have been for, OTHER than to 
stiffen it up? &gt;&gt;

Don't presume to understand why a PO did anything...Could have been pre-
emptive welding to prevent a beam from rusting out and collapsing...Could
have been welded in by someone who did a similar job on another type of ve-
hicle - The &quot;worked there&quot; scenario? Unless you're keeping or restoring your
bus bog stock, if it stays around another twenty years, consider what some
FO (Future Owner) will be asking about why you did what you did...
