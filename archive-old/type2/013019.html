&gt;Usually CHEAP vise grips slip off. I found out years ago that with vise
&gt;grips, you get what you pay for. I no longer buy any other than Vise Grip
&gt;brand. Even Craftsman are junk, but a lot better than the China/Taiwan crap.
&gt;Put the allen socket/wrench in the bolt head as deep and tight as you can.
&gt;Then put the vise grips on the head of the bolt and squeeze them as tight as
&gt;you can.

Karl is right on with this, REAL Vice Grips are hard enough to get a grab
into a 10.9 grade metric bolt, others are not.  Heck maybe not even Vice
Grips my newest set is 10 years old.  Heating is also good though if you can
heat down at the threads.  Again my best tip always, put the correct hex or
triple square socket in (about even likelihood of either being used or still
in a '78 I'd say) then HIT IT, repeatedly with a hammer, 50 times, good solid
whacks, cound all 50.  Cleaning out the socket first, then hitting it, I've
not
lost one (even stripped out by PO ones) in about 10 years.  And the same
applies to brake bleeder screws, 50 little taps square on the screw before I
ever touch a wrench to it.  And throw any slightly stripped CV screw right
into
the trash and find new ones.
