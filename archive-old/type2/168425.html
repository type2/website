Subject: Fuse Box wiring/ dimmer relay.

I just got a new turn signal switch for my '74 bus. It has the '73/early '74
version.

I had it all hooked up and everything worked except for the high beam
switch. I tried to trace the brown/white wire that goes to the fuse box and
inavertently pulled it off. (when i installed it i cut it and made a splice,
the replacement had that wire cut) . It was loose and thats why the high
beams weren't working.

I can't see in there to hook it back up. Its the wire that goes to terminal
&quot;S&quot; on the dimmer realy. Where does that wire plug into on the top of the
fuse box? Does anyone have a picture of it so I can feel it out?

I have the cluster out and I really don't want to take the top of the dash
off ( but I will if I have to). I think the switch might be bad. They were
working fine with the old switch, but the turn signal mechanism was busted.
Now I have good turn signals and no high beams :)

thanks in advance.
Eddie
