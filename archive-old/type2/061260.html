&gt; did not come over well. But am I right in cutting a 4&quot; square hole in
&gt; the middle &amp; 4&quot; back from the 45 degree of the wheel arch section?

All I can say, is don't cut your bus there!!!!!
It's a real bad idea. A PO did that to one of my buses and not only does the fuel guage not work that well, but you get fumes into the bus through the hole!  Just pull the motor and gas tank and switch the fuel sender properly. FO's will thank you.
