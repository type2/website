Subject: New Email, same great taste

I profusely apologize for taking up list space with this but I have some bus deals in the making with a few list members, and I don't want them to think I have disappeared.  Anyway, my new email address is john_at_manmademoon_dot_com  (current email will be terminated shortly)I will subscribe to the list from this address, and again I apologize, but I really don't want to make those list members think I have disappeared.



Peace, John Baker
