Subject: brake adjusting stars

I ordered some stars a while back, and I wonder why
some of the new ones are brass as opposed to steel.  I
assume the brass does not corrode into the holes as
easily, but I would think that the brass would get
chewed up when trying to adjust them, or if they got
lodged in the holes.  Are there any new ones that are
not brass?  Most websites I look at either don't show
pictures, or you can't tell whether its brass or
steel.  Just wondering
