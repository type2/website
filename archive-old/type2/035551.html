Just to clarify, this is the lever on the transmission, correct?

If the return spring broke, and you still had a functional pressure plate,
the lever would not do this.   If the pivot pin at the front (for the
pedal) broke, again, it would not do this.


Your problem lies between the lever on the transmission and the ends of
the fork that the t/o bearing rides on.

Could be that the splines on either the lever for the shaft of the fork
have stripped, and now the lever is just sliding along..but i've never
seen nor heard of this.;/

Or, one or both of your forks have broken off the shaft in the bellhousing
of the transmission.  You will have to pull the engine to verify this.

They break either at the weld on the shaft, or at the little &quot;cup&quot;
indention that the t/o bearing rests in.

For a 64 Bus, RMM lists # 113 141 701CHD at 9.95    You can likely get it
from Ron at the Bus Depot a few dollar cheaper. (btw, GOOD VWFLAPS should
carry this as well...)

It is fairly straight forward to removeand install, though you may wish to
see about getting new bushings for it while you have it apart. (maybe a
few more dollars, i have seen them listed, you can look them up
yourself.;)

There is a C clip at the end of the shaft with the lever, slide the lever
off, there is another C clip on the other side of the shaft (iirc), remove
that, (with the t/o bearing already off) slide the shaft to the left, you
should be able to remove the rubber/plastic bushing when you do this (you
need to remove it to get the needed play for shaft removal), drop the far
end out of its hole, slide it all out to the right...

Installation is reverse of removal.  I probably missed something, but
thats the basics.


good luck.
