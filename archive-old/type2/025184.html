Can anyone recommend a good paint shop in the Boulder, CO area?  I have a 71
that I would like to get re-painted.

TIA,

Rawls Moore

MAny years ago Clara &amp; I put an engine from a crashed 77 bus into gher 73
camper. I still have the sliding door sitting in my garage and need the
room.
I llive in Cupertino in the san Francisco bay area, and could be persuaded
to take it to bugorama in sacramento.
If I hear nothing in the next few weeks it goes out with the garbage, window
lok trim &amp; all!
