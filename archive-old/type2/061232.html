&gt; about the general sort?  

If this is all that is wrong with the electrical system (ie. lights 
and gauges, turn signals, etc. work okay) then rewiring the whole bus 
sounds pretty drastic.  The generator circuit is fairly straight 
forward and mostly confined to the engine compartment.  If the 
generator and regulator are charging okay then there is probably a 
short somewhere else, possibly a wire intermittently rubbing against 
the body.  There are techniques to see if there is something drawing 
current when the ignition and all is off.  If this is the case, you 
can further narrow it down by removing fuses until you determine 
which circuit is giving you problems, then track it down from there.
