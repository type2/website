Subject: adjusting mixture without exhaust analyzer

Just in case my last email doesn't work out...
Does anyone know of any technique to adjust the mixture without an analyzer.
I read one idea that said to turn the mixture in until the engine speed 
drops, than out for max idle speed. then in to drop 50 rpm, than out a 1/4 
of a turn.
It said it will be approximate. How would this work and do I want to attempt 
it If I am pretty sure my mixture is off?
Also, When checking for RPM with a multimeter where should I touch the leads 
to? And should rpms increase while in park?
Thanks again,
Kyle
