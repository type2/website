&lt;&lt; I've had to do this by getting a steel pipe approx 2' long and creating a

breaker bar. Let gravity do its job :-) It's cheap and works really well.


HTH,

Harry &gt;&gt;

From the don't-try-this-at-home-file:
A friend of a friend some years ago was having trouble getting the
driver's side nut off the back wheel of a square back...Despite my
or my friend's advice, the guy was &quot;sure&quot; VW used a reverse thread
on the driver's side...Now, the cars up on four jack stands and the 
guy decides to put the wrench on the nut, and a pipe extension on
the breaker bar...Climbs into the car and starts it up...Puts it into 
first and knocks the car off the stands... D'oh...
