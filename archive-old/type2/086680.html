Can we not go through this whole saga of compression ratios and engine
longevity and heat ad nauseum...?

Hi all,

I called today to get prices on pistons and the shop person asked me if I
wanted flat-top or dish-top pistons.  I asked the difference, and she said
that the dish-top pistons are better suited to bus engines due to their
heavier weight, and the engine &quot;pings&quot; less when the engine is under stress

(like a hill).  The drawback to the dish-top pistons is their lower
compression, and the fact that the engine wears quicker b/c the compression

starts lower on the dish-shaped pistons opposed to the flat-top pistons
(using compression as an indicator of engine heath).  Does anybody have any

info or opinions on this subject?
