Hello list:

I have a VDO tach, a Series 1, that I bought a few months ago.  I tried to wire it up this past weekend, but when I looked at the instructions, they were for a different tach.  My tach has terminals 2,3, and 4 on it, so I need to know which ones get wired to +12V, Gnd, and signal.  Also, there's a small 3-position switch.  Does this need to be set in any particular way?

Thanks,

Jim Hood,
