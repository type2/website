Subject: Synthetic gear oil okay?

Hi,

I am going to change my transmission fluid this weekend, just because I
do not know the history of when if ever it has been replaced. I looked
in the archives and it seems that others agree that it is a good idea to
change it, even if it is not stated in the Bentley to do so at regular
intervals. Do you all still agree? Is there anything I need to know or
helpful hints.

My main question is it okay to use Valvoline 80/90 synthetic gear oil?
What are GL#'s I see mentioned in the archive posts? Are there pros or
cons to synthetic gear oil?

Thanks

Meg
