Subject: Egg on my bus

My bus was egged last night or the night before.  I'm angry about it and don't have anyone else to tell right now.  Is it because I live in a very republican neighborhood and have anti-bush stickers on my van?  Perhaps it's because it doesn't move every day like it used to, although it is parked right in front of my house.  Maybe it's because the neighborhood kids have nothing to do but ride their scooters and bikes up and down the street all night long.  

I don't know.  Here I go to wash it off... thanks for listening.
