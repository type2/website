&gt;I'm about to buy a new cam for my 78 2000cc engine I'm rebuilding.
&gt;According to Bently and Muir I need to check the inner face of the cam
&gt;gear for pitch radius departure numbers +/- 1,2,3 etc. Having checked
&gt;the gear I have found no such marking. So I looked at the gear on a cam
&gt;from a 75 1800cc engine and found no such number? Does this pitch radius
&gt;marking only apply to type 1 engines? Am I not looking in the right
&gt;place? Help me please! I want to get the right part the first time.

D Elgin claims (and I'm apt to believe them the way they wear) that T4
cams were not surface hardened from the factory.  Take it FWIW, they
did a spectacular job regrinding my last one for $60 (and shipping both
ways.)  This gets you out of needing to worry about swapping gears and
or tracking down a correct gear.  If your gear is not marked and it is a
factory gear (has VW numbers) it is likely a stock -0 gear.  I've seen
about half that way, half with the -0 marked, both bear the same PN
on the gear (which escapes me.)  The PNs do change for the different
sizes.  All aftermarket gears are likely -0.

But give Elgin a thought, they have a nice improved grind, as well as
several more exotic grinds for bigger motors.  Run new lifters of course,
good quality OEM lifters.  Haven't put that many miles on it, and I did
send them a pretty nice core not a terribly worn thing, so I don't know
about longetivity.  They got a good rep though.

Oh Elgin is on the net, do a search for D Elgin cam on your favorite engine.
