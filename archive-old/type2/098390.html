Subject: Re: [T2] customer service by Bus Depot - a long posting

Hello,

I dont think Cheri ment to sound harsh in her email.
She was probably just trying to inform you of their
policy so there would be no misunderstanding. Emails
can be strange like that. Some times typed words alone
can be writen with the intent of sounding professional
and clear but be read as being rude and harsh. words
can't express everyting and signals can be crossed.
That is how alot of flame wars happen on the list. 

Any how, I am sure that the email she sent can be
interperted in a different way by each person who
reads it. I would give them the benifit of the doubt.
Any how, how do the floor mats fit? I would like to
buy a set in the future. Did yours appear to be good
quality?

Any way, I understand your perdiciment. Just hang in
there, I am sure that they will get it straightened
out for you. Have a  great day!

&gt; Hi List,
&gt; 
&gt; I am bummed at the Bus Depot.  
&gt; 
&gt; In August I ordered a set of floor mats for my bus -
&gt; approx. $150.  The 
&gt; first order got lost by the post office.  The Bus
&gt; Depot said no biggie, 
&gt; wait 30 days and we'll send you a replacement. 
 In October I get the first shipment of floor mats. 
&gt; Just shows up.  I figure I be
&gt; nice and call the Bus 
&gt; Depot and ask them what they want done.  &gt; 
&gt; I got a big surprise.  See the email below.

&gt; &gt;Brad,
&gt; &gt;Thanks for writing.  Please send the duplicate
&gt; order back to us.  If we do
&gt; &gt;not receive it within 30 days, we will have to
&gt; charge you for the duplicate
&gt; &gt;order...
&gt; I mean what's with these guys?  Or what's with
&gt; Cheri?  A little harsh don't you think?
