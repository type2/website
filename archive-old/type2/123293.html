Subject: Re: [T2] Keeping a Manual Transmision Alive

Shawn,

The Ford house...&quot;fluidizer&quot;

comes in a 4fl oz bottle..._dot_use 2 oz in your tranny.

actually called &quot;additive friction modifier&quot; on the bottle

XL3  &quot;Ford internal ref # 137219&quot;

The local Ford parts guy says he can hardly keep it in stock...all the 
drag and street racers come in and buy it.....from corvette...to hemi's
My other car is a F***  SVT  works great in the manual trans with 
automatic fluid in it.

as always...YMMV


Cheers, dave

&gt; I was checking out the Muir book today and see that he recommends adding magic
&gt; juice to trannies to prolong life.  It seems that my '87 Jetta is experiencing
&gt; the very same grinds, growls and popping out of gears that describes for
&gt; air-cooled transmissions in the 'Idiot book'.
&gt; 
&gt; I did a flush of the fluids and managed to keep my vehicle running ok for now,
&gt; but I am curious... has anyone had any success using  Muir's method?  If so,
&gt; what kind of juice did you put into your bus VW tranny to keep it running?  I
&gt; can only find magic juice for automatics.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
&gt; Shawn.
