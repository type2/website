Subject: Re: [T2] Looks like JBB in a Jeep?

Take it apart - you have nothing to lose... Bag, photograph, and inventory everything as you take it apart so later you know where and what everything is... 

If the case is not ruined, or the crank is not ruined you can reuse these and turn the crank and use oversized bearings. If it has a bunch of miles on it - is it an original engine? If so then you'd at least have an engine built with parts that you know the history of - i.e. not a junkyard engine... 

It could have seized pistons/cylinders and everything else be fine. If so tear it down, measure everything and replace the bearings, have parts turned if necessary, clean everything, reassemble with a new top end... 

Would be a GREAT oppotunity to learn some new skills and possibly save some cash at the same time.
