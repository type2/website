Hey all,
 I thought I would forward this to the list. I got it from the type3 list
regarding the licensing deal.

&gt; 
&gt; This is what I sent 'em in the feedback form:
&gt; 
&gt; ---
&gt; You guys are making the very people who like VW extraordinarily hostile
&gt; towards the company and its products.
&gt; 
&gt; It is NOT trademark infringement to have pictures of *my car* on *my*
&gt; web site. It is NOT trademark infringement to write about Volkswagen or
&gt; any other company name - see the law statutes and any business newspaper
&gt; for proof positive of this. It is NOT trademark infringement to run
&gt; events for other car owners. It IS trademark infringement to attempt to
&gt; SELL like goods or services under the trademarks that you hold, for
&gt; example if someone tried to sell knock off copies of your distinctive
&gt; badge, or if another car manufacturer built a Golf or a New Beetle and
&gt; tried to sell them. 
&gt; 
&gt; All that is required to protect your marks is for the enthusiasts to put
&gt; &quot;Volkswagen (tm)&quot; or &quot;Beetle (R)&quot; on their pages. By law, people do not
&gt; have to license *ANYTHING* from you and you know it. It's just an ambit
&gt; claim to try and stifle free speech and enthusiast web sites. 
&gt; 
&gt; Trademark law, as you know being a lawyer, is a method of protecting you
&gt; from competitors who are SELLING products that trade upon the good will
&gt; of the VW brands and marks. Enthusiast sites, like mine, do nothing of
&gt; the sort, and you are chilling free speech. Your actions are legally
&gt; unenforceble and not in the spirit or the letter of the trademark law.
&gt; We do not sign license agreements with the papers for our car - we own
&gt; them. You cannot impose additional conditions after sale.
&gt; 
&gt; I've owned five VW's and with the current quality woes of my New Turbo
&gt; Beetle (the right rear bearing has rusted out and it's not even 7 months
&gt; old and the ABS unit has to be replaced because it could set fire to the
&gt; car), VW do not need to cause us any more grief! 
&gt; 
&gt; Be sensible, and stop pissing off the very people who make VW the third
&gt; largest car manufacturer today.
&gt; 
&gt; Check out the following supreme court decisions: 
&gt; http://www4.law.cornell_dot_edu/cgi-bin/empower?DB=SupctSyllabi&amp;TOPDOC=0&amp;QUE
&gt; RY00=trademark&amp;PROP00=t=b
&gt; 
&gt; None of them uphold your disgusting attempt at chilling free speech.
