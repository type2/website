Subject: Re: [T2] Electric or Propane conversions

I don't know about the hybrid, but electrical conversions were done
professionally in Germany during the 1970s. IG T2 has just acquired one
of these buses. Just follow the link for pictures and information (in
German).

&lt;&lt; &gt; &gt;Does anyone have any information on Electric or Propane
conversions for 
type

a small
&gt; &gt;Honda generator making it a hybrid.  Has anyone done this?
