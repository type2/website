&gt;&gt;Why remove them (screens) you ask?  So that when you're driving mit Jalousie-Fenstern
versehen opened the screens won't whistle!  I store mine underneath the
rear-hatch cushion so I've always got them when I need them. &lt;&lt;

What- youd drive with the widows open?  The air outside makes them flap up
and down, and tire out the gear that opens them, causing more play....proof
is in a typical late Westy- crank open the door side window half way up.
Do the same for the one over the sink.  Now lift the vanes- usually are
pretty tight on the driver side, flap up and down on the other!   Yes we do
drive with the window open, but just lifted a bit, not way out where air
can catch underneath.
