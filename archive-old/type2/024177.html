Justin,

If it truly was designed for your year of bus, it would seem to make sense 
that it is set up for a catalytic converter.  If there is any question as to 
its design, also make sure the tailpipes are really set up correctly for a 
bus.  

If you look carefully at all stock bus exhaust tailpipes, you'll see they 
exit at the rear CORNER of the vehicle, not directly behind like a beetle.  
The exhaust needs to make it out into the slipstream and AWAY from the back 
hatch and engine lid!

The aerodynamics of the bus maintains a big pocket of dead air directly 
behind it at highway speeds.  If you dump your vehicle's exhaust directly 
into this space it swirls around there and some of it inevitably makes it 
past the 20+ year old seals of the back hatch into your bus or it gets sucked 
passed the engine lid seals into the engine compartment, into the fan and 
through the heat system into your passenger compartment.

If you have ever had leaky push rod tube seals you may have seen the effects 
of this swirling around of &quot;dead&quot; air in the oil spots that COVER the rear of 
the bus.
