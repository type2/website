Subject: Re: [T2] Exaust Stud removal and other

Ever since moving north, my propane torch which used to sit idle is getting
a workout. I've been useing the heat and wax method, so far has worked fine
on two heads with no broken studs.

&gt; Hey, i know this might be a little late, but there's a penetrating lube
&gt; that Chrysler makes.  You'd have to go to a dealership and ask the parts
&gt; guy to sell you a can.  It's the best rust freeing stuff i've ever used,
&gt; and it made my studs come right out without any problems...  It's got a
&gt; Mopar part number 4318039.  They call it Rust Penetrant, Heat Control
&gt; Valve Solvent.  It's the best secret they've got.  Give it a try if you
&gt; want.  I'd just be scared of torching my heads.  But that's me.
&gt; Oh yeah.  You've got to let the stuff soak for a while.  Spray it and
&gt; let it sit, and repeat a couple times before you try to get them out.
&gt;  This stuff turns rust into mud.
&gt; Hope it works for you as well as it did for me.
