Yes, it should breath freely. Soak it for a coupla hours in keroseen or a
petro solvent. Shake it around, blow it out, repeat as many times as it
takes to get the crud out. Then clean the hose and the intake system where
build up will also be found, and don't forget the throttle body. Make sure
the little vacuum holes are clear and the butterfly and venturi are clean.
