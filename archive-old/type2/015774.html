&gt;I realize I could just take off maybe my radio block off plate or
&gt;something and the paint store could match the colour but I can't believe
&gt;that 40 year old paint hasn't faded at least some.  I would rather have
&gt;a formula for the original.

The problem you're facing is even if you *did* have an old formula book,
the paint materials themselves have changed, evolving significantly over
the past 40 years.  In order for those formulas to work, you would also
have to have the original base, tints, reducers, etc, too.  

Paint companies don't really have a sound business case to keep generating
formulaes for old paint.  How much of it do they really sell?  They'll sell
20 times as much paint for 1995 Hondas as they would for all VW buses
combined. 

Your best bet is to either find a chunk of metal in the color you need -
try using to polishing compound and cleaning it up - or consult one of the
professional VW restoration places, like Gary Lavere
(http://www.vwrestorations_dot_com) or Lenny Copp
(http://www.classicvws_dot_com/top.htm).  They do this much more frequently,
and have obviously engineered around the problems.  These two are by no
means the limit of the available resources, but are two that popped into my
mind at that second and that I had URLs for.
