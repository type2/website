Subject: legal to shave side markers?

I was scootin' around the net the otherday looking at bus-stuff, and came 
across a Bay for sale.

The description said the side markers were shaved. I know Euro vehicles did 
not require them, can U.S. busses for some reason now shed them, or is this 
guy just laughing in the face of danger?
