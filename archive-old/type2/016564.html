&gt; I work for a FLAPS. I have a pretty good general knowledge of vehicles of
&gt; all makes and a good knowledge of a few. Imports more than domestics. After
&gt; witnessing several returns the other day on sales made by one of our
&gt; teenage employees, I commented to my wife, that you would think a FLAPS'
&gt; most important investment would be a good group of mechanics or former
&gt; mechanics as sales persons. Of course we all know better.
&gt; 
&gt; The average customer only has a slight idea of what they need. Couple that
&gt; to the barest slightest knowledge of the employee of what the customer
&gt; needs and it is amazing anything ever gets done on these broken cars. (snip), but beware you drivers
&gt; of the uncommon and unusual....
&gt; 
&gt; My wife dares all of you to call a local FLAPS and ask for a 'GEOTHERMAL
&gt; PLUNKITY VALVE' and see what happens. I estimate 8 minutes or more to
&gt; realize there isn't such a part with a 1 in 7 chance that they will simply
&gt; tell you they don't carry those and refer you to the dealer.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the bandwidth, just needed to vent a little hot air.
&gt; 
&gt; Take care all!

Chris:
My experience is very similar- worked in a FLAPS from 71-74, built
racecar motors, some pro- wrenching, lotsa amateur wrenching mostly VW
and Porsche since then. Acqaintances from the FLAPS called me at home
for at least 10-12 YEARS afterwards. My brother is a  pro mechanic
(Porsche- Audi schools) largest independent BMW repair in Omaha,
(EUROWORX), pretty good sense of humor. He believes that there is a real
opportunity for a 1-900- type car repair advice service. It would be a
good job for mechanics who are getting up there in years when their
hands and backs and knees just aren't what they used to be. However they 
would probably have to still be inolved in the trade to stay on top of
the curve of knowledge that was saleable.
