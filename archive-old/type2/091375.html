Subject: Re: [T2] fuel injection

I think the best thing to do would be to take some pics of exactly
what you have. Post a url to the list &amp; ask people either what exactly
you have &amp; what it looks like you are missing, then with this list you
can call/search around &amp; get prices.

&gt; So the word is stick with the injection, problem is I didnt take it out of 
&gt; the last bus the guy I bought the engine from did. So we are missing whatever 
&gt; control modules and aircleaner stuff that all this FI plugs into. Everything 
&gt; that is bolted to the engine itself was there. So who might have this extra 
&gt; stuff, what is it called and how much to atain it. Can I test anything with 
&gt; it out of the vehicle and missing the control module. thanks again Dylan
