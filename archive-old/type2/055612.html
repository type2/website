Rob,

        Hey, &quot;Camper of America&quot;....thats a new one here.  Please check out
the page that I have thrown together of all the campers I have pix of.
http://ourworld_dot_compuserve_dot_com/homepages/jjrodgers1/dialvsez.htm (big size,
slow loader).  It would be nice if you could identify one of our interior
pix as a &quot;Camper of America&quot;.

          The discussion is regarding the #2 and #3  Vw Camper conversion
companies (in the US)  next to the obvious #1 Westy.  Sundial is the most
infamous non-Westy camper.   The EZ Camper seems to be next  for pre '68. 
ASI/ Riviera keeps popping up but I am most commonly hearing them
associated to Bays.  We are finding that there were many, many different
companies in the US.  We are trying to throw out some pictures on the net
that we can join together to help identify what each other has in efforts
of having some type of reference for restoration.

Take care,

Josh Rodgers
Ponca City, OK
'58 Panel, '64 Single Cab, '65 Sundial/EZ, '65 Westy,  '69 Daily, '70

I know zippo about campers, other than the fact that I think they're all
cool, because I haven't had the experience to fine tune my appreciation. 

I was at a local VW shop yesterday and the owner had what he called a '67
Camper of America.  Not a Westy, not a Sundial, but a Camper of America.  I
had never heard this one before.  Original paint.  I didn't take the time
to check it out, it had a tarp ov!
er it.  I've got to go back down today so I take a closer peek.  So what
gives with this particular camper version?  Are they rare, or is there not
much discussion on them because they don't compare to a Westy or Sundial?
