Subject: loaf layout idea

i have a 74 bus with a 69-71 or so layout in it. i have the suicide
closet on the right side of the car next to the fold out bench/bed. with
one rear facing seat on the driver side, and the sink/water/icebox on
the passenger side, i am considering extending the rear facing seat  (it
would be permenent) to accomodate another passenger. this would:

1- add room for another passenger while in transit
2- add more storage space for trips
3- close off any access to the front of the bus (i guess like the 60's
non walkthroughs)
4 -allow me to buy or build a centre console in between the two front
seats. for storage, CD's, cup holders, etc ,etc

has anyone else thought of this? anyone else done this? any ideas or
thoughts - pro or con on my idea?

thanks, dave
