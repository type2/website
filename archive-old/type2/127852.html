I thought this was correct as well, but since our friend seemed quite
confident that the holes are spaced different I went out to the garage
to look. On both a web cam and stock cam shaft the holes are not equal
distance from each other. Now this doesn't mean that the cam is not in
some way not correct, but it does mean that the assembly can only be
assembled one way. I also noticed that my holes in my cam gear will
need to be drilled out to accomodate the larger cam bolts.
