Subject: 34-PICT-3 Choke

Greetings -

The 1915 is fed by a modified 34-PICT-3 carb (009 and Blue Bosch as well,
but I don't think that makes much of a difference for this exercise), and is
running well when warmed up - though a tad on the rich side.

My problem is the warm-up cycle, and I have a couple of issues here. As
usual, I want to hear of any possible problems I hadn't thought of before I
start hacking.

First, it runs just way too rich at cold start, and I'd like to remove the
choke butterfly. When I finger the butterfly mechanism / stepped idle cam
for no butterfly, and four &quot;clicks&quot; of idle increase, the motor runs really
good at cold start. If I let the butterfly choke the air, the engine
stumbles. I've eyed the mechanism, and see no way other than removing the
butterfly to accomplish this.

Secondly, I have the extra 1.5 quart oil sump, which makes warm-up take
longer. I need the choke to keep the idle RPM up for an extra 3-5 minutes.
My options? Crank the choke another few degrees CCW, or somehow convince the
choke spring not to unwind so quickly (take the electric lead off?).

So... Take off the butterfly? Remove the electric lead? Twist the spring CCW
more?

Thanks again -
