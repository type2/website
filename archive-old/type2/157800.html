Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuilt engine in or around Raleigh, NC?

Some Beetle cases can be machined to have the mustache bar bolted directly
on. Otherwise, buying a new universal case and building that up is what I
did - you'll save a few bucks, and also know it's done right (as long as
you trust yourself)
For that matter, I have a couple old bus cases kicking around the house
that might be good with a line bore...you're welcome to take a look some
evening...I'd probably let one go cheap...

&gt; Part of the problem is that the case is a beetle case and I'd rather not
&gt; have to use the adapter.  Should I buy a case and build it from the
&gt; ground up or get a longblock?  I assume it would be cheaper to build
&gt; from case up?
