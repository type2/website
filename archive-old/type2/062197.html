Subject: curtains for 76 bus

Hey now!
    I'm going to be installing curtains in my 76 Bus and am looking for 
advice.  Can anyone point me towards archives, faq's, or websites with 
any info?  Any advice from anyone out there who has done this?  
    I thought I could use the existing knobs to hang clothes on and 
attach a flat metal rod across to act as the curtain rod.  but where 
there are none of those clothes hangers, I don't know how to attach Tthe 
rod.  I don't want to go drilling into the side of the van until I know 
what I'm getting into.  Along the bottom of the curtains I would attach a 
cord to hold the curtains to the side of the van, like in a westy.  Would 
it be easiest to get all the hardware and rods off some junked westy?

Thanks,
Scott
