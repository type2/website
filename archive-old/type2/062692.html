Hello fellow lovers of VW Buses and Campbuses!
I need some advice...in a hurry.

So I wrote:
If it won't crank, problem is probably the battery (low or needs replacing)
or the starter (needs replacing). Should get those things checked out if you
can. You can't really assess its condition in other ways until you can get it
to start.

$1000 seems like a kind of low to low-medium price for a bus. For that price,
I would expect you are buying into some other problems not too far down the 
line. No problem if you have cash and/or resources (time and desire and a 
place to work) to fix it up yourself. For that price, it should go though!

I like my auto transmission 78 pretty well. It can't be push started and can
be harder to jerk out of stuck-in-the-mud-or-sand situations, and people say 
they lose about 5% power relative to a manual trans. But auto transmissions
for VW are often very reliable and commonly go 250,000 miles before rebuild 
time. Mine is quiet and smooth. But DON'T use those trans fluid additives that
say they'll rejuvenate your seals and blah blah blah. I did once and it was a 
big disaster.

If you don't feel up to working on a fixer upper bus, maybe you should hold 
out for a more high end bus. A real solid bus with no imminent mechanical
problems might sell for $3000-$4500, depending on how immaculate it is. If 
you feel up to the challenge of a fixer upper, and can recolve problems re
starting, have a mechanic check it out (compression test, etc.) and buy it
if he says OK.

Let us know how it goes,
Surfer Bob
