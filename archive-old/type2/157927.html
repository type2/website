Subject: Re: [T2] Help!! SOLEX carb kit needed..

&gt; I have a SOLEX carb coded  C34 TCIC / 13  090, made in Italy
&gt;
&gt; Yes, I thought the first character would be a &quot;0&quot;, but this is definately a
&gt; &quot;C&quot;...  And the &quot;C&quot; character is at least 10% larger than the &quot;34&quot; numbers.
&gt; And it is a different &quot;C&quot; than the other pair of &quot;C&quot;s
&gt;
&gt; It is a '2 barrel' carb, with two air intake, and just one of the air
&gt; intakes has a choke.
