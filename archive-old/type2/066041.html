&gt; &gt; BUT, the greatest thing about owning a bus is it is the perfect
&gt; &gt; automotive example of reduce, reuse, recycle.  We are reducing the number
&gt; &gt; of new cars being produced, which contributes to all kinds of &quot;bad&quot;
&gt; &gt; things, environmental and not.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone on the list have any statistics about the amount of
&gt; energy/pollution it takes to make a new car or truck? I too rely on the
&gt; 'at least I'm not driving a new car' excuse to myself when I think about
&gt; emmissions - that, and the 'keep it in tune' and 'ride the bike when
&gt; possible' solutions... The recycling argument makes sense, but I sure
&gt; wish someone had the numbers...

I agree with Anton and Amy's posts.  I, also, would like some solid statistics
about which scenerio pollutes the most.  It seems to me, that in the long
run, the person buying 4 - 5 or 6 cars in 20 years is going to end up 
polluting/pillaging the environment far more than a person keeping 1 car
for 20 years.  But I don't have the statistics to prove it.  Can someone
please point to real data to enlighten me and others.  It's hard to con-
vince anyone without the facts.

Thanks,

Steven
