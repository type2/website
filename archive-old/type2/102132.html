Subject: Re: [T2] Soft Brakes?

Hi Wayne,
    Air in the system can cause a soft brake pedal. Rear
 shoes out of adjustment (too loose) will cause a low
 pedal and a not so good parking brake(also loose). 
The rear shoes are not self adjusting on my
 78 and require tweaking every 10 k miles to keep the
 pedal / hand brake at the proper operational  position.  
    In your case I would try bleeding first (easiest) 
then adjust the rears per bentley.  
    I would not expect any brake fluid to get past the pistons.
 If you get brake fluid past the pistons and out to the rubber end
 caps I would strongly consider a cylinder rebuild or replacement. 
I like rebuilding (I know when the cylinder has a nice smooth 
 proper bore) most just replace the cylinder when / if indoubt.       
If you flip the rubber end cap down there should be no fluid 
drain out. 
   Best of luck to you and your bus. 
 
Darrell

&gt; Gang:
&gt; 
&gt; I have a 78 Westy, and just replaced the rear wheel cylinders, the rear
&gt; brake pads, calipers, and the front brake pads for the disc brakes.  After
&gt; bleeding it, my brakes were still soft.  So I took it to a professional
&gt; 
&gt; Secondly, when I install the new cylinders I noticed that pressing in the
&gt; piston &quot;all the way&quot; caused some fluid to come out from around the pistons.
&gt; Is this normal -- I believe I have seen it before.  Can some confirm?
&gt; 
&gt; Kind Regards,
&gt; Wayne Berry
