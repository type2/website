Subject: Re: [T2] wheels and tires in the time of cholera.

&lt;&lt; I would prefer alloy wheels. I would like a set of long lasting, quiet 
tires. I would like a combination of alloys and tires which didn't 
significantly affect my speedometer and also fit my bus. I'd like to 
load up my 78 seven passenger with people and/or stuff and safely move the 
passengers and cargo. &gt;&gt;

I've got 14 inch M-B alloys that require a minimal amount of work to
fit the Bus and take the recommended tires... ;-)
