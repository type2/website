  I usually let off the pedal when the oil temp runs above 225 consistantly. 

  While having gauges is a great for knowing the general health of your 
engine at any given time &quot;gauge watching&quot;, as you will come to find out,it 
can cause you a good bit of stress at times. I start stressing anytime i look 
at the gauges and find them varied from there normal readings.Most times it 
has nothing to do with the operating conditons off the bus. It was usually do 
the load in the bus, head winds , temp or something else.
  The cylinder head temp ,depending on where its connected , (mine was 
connected under #3 spark plug) will run in the 325to 400  .Mine averaged 
around 350. Much above 400 and I would start to stress.

  Happy &quot;gauge watching&quot;
