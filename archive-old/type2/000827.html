Hi All:  While torquing up the right hand heater box to head joint on The
Contraption I pulled a stud out of the head! The head only has 4k on a
rebuild from AVP.
The stud seems to be stepped but not much. A quick check of the archives
told me that I have a 8mm/9mm stepped stud. Is this original or a repair?
Will a 10mm/8mm x1.25 stud work if I drill and tap the head or would I be
better to try and find a 9mm helicoil? 10mm?

I'm in Ontario Canada. Anyone know where to purchase the helicoils and
insertion tool?

Thanks Phil
