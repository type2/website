&gt;  Since installing the gauges, I have seen CHT at about 300 deg max., OT
&gt; at about 180 to 200 deg. max. and OP at about 25 psi (hot), all at highway

&gt; About 2 weekends ago, I went did a 3 hour or so trip, and suddenly saw CHT
&gt; hitting the 400 deg mark, and I also saw rather large CHT temperature
swings
&gt; from loaded to unloaded (i.e., uphill vs downhill) which I have not seen
&gt; before to this degree.  OT and OP are still following the normal pattern of
&gt; the last 2 years, and the bus seems to be running fine.

Your cht temps are low in my books,, maybe your highway speeds are 55 - 60
mph? lower than my 75 mph
or you have the CHT somewhere other than the #3 plug

I am guessing your driving habits stayed the same, and you have driven the
same sort of terain before,
so I would guess maybe you got some gasoline that is a different blend??

Or,, there is an vacuum leak causing the engine to run a bit lean?
The distributor decided to seize up and fail to advance properly,
could the CHT sender have been loose?
What color are your spark plugs,, do they look lean?


I dunno, It sure will be interesting to hear what caused this.
