Subject: Veeddubs in Vancouver

If anyone knows of any reasonably priced veedub vans (1970-79) for sale in
the Vancouver/Greater Vancouver area  it would be much appreciated.

Looking mainly for a Westy, but passenger van would suffice..

(for my sister... She is desperately seeking a nice VW she can call her own..)
