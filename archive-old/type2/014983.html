Subject: Oil filler locations - engine size?
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.1.32.19990620144703.0068c978_at_pop.mindspring_dot_com&gt;

I was poking around in the engine compartment of our 
other 1972 Bus today (the camper).  I noticed the oil 
filler and oil dipstick are mounted on top of the engine.  
On our blue 1972 bus, the oil filler and dipstick are
at the back of the engine.

Also, the oil dipstick on the camper doesn't come out all
the way since it hits the top of the engine compartment,
and being a '72, there is no hatch to remove.

I also found the nuts for the valve adjusters are 14mm, while
the nuts on the blue '72 and our '71 Squareback are 13mm.

&gt;From this information I would guess the engine in our
camper has been replaced.  But with what?  It certainly
looks like a Type 4 engine, but is it a later (and
possibly larger) than 1972 and 1700cc?  What other
clues can I look for?

Thanks
Dave
