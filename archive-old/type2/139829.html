&gt; BTW, I am now [Monday]  off to Banks junk yard(s)  in Fredericksburg VA.  My
&gt; cell is 571 235 4479.  I should be on line until 2-4 PM today.  My planned
&gt; trip tomorrow is to the Banks in Conowingo MD [camping at the base of the
&gt; Conowingo Dam tonight], and Jessup MD and Erdman Ave Baltimore MD (No, I
&gt; don't like the 'new' Crazy Ray's.  They do not get as fresh a stock as the
&gt; other two, because they are not crushing and replacing, just using their
&gt; current inventory.)  Cell phone also.  If you need anything small...

if you see an auto tranny 75-79 bus with an intact shift linkage give me a
call.  otherwise if you want to do lunch tommorrow there are a couple
places near the Erdman Ave crazy rays let me know. (besides the McDonald's
where we met last time)

take care find some good stuff

Bob
