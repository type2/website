Subject: VW Junkyard phone #?

Re Mike Benthin's post:

&gt;Got this off the acvw page on the web (courtesy of the VW Junkyard)- why
&gt;you should listen to us here and NOT those auto guys on PBS radio!
&gt;    FIRE HAZARD:    LATE MODEL VW BUSES ( 73- )
&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&gt;Just got a pretty disturbing phone call, and I'm not real sure if
&gt;what follows is a bona-fido VW fire hazard...

These VW Junkyard people sound pretty solid. Anyone have their phone number?
Do they deliver nationally? Thanks.
