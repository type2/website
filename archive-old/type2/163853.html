Subject: Re: [T2] Intro and Gas vs Mig

Thanks for all the responses.  I decided that I'm going to just rent a
MIG for the weekend and do as much work as I can get done in that
time.  The next time I'm at my dad's house, I'll use his oxy-acetylene
torch on some scraps and compare the two.  If I am happy with the
results MIG (which it sounds like I'm going to be), I'll just bite the
bullet and get the beefiest MIG I can afford.

Thanks again,
Ken

PS: if you have a MIG recommendation or source, I'd be happy to hear about it.

PPS:  I just uploaded the old pictures of my rear facing seat and our
&quot;re-upholstery&quot; job (rear only) in case anyone is interested. The site
