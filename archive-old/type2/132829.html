&gt; we heard a deep snoring sound coming from under the bus which we could

&gt; mph?) in 4th gear. We do not hear the sound at lower speeds, nor when the
&gt; engine is idling.

One way to help track it down would be to empty out the back down to bare
metal and have someone sit back there to listen for it as you take it out
for a test drive.

Your description of the sound brings two possibilities to mind:

1) Decelaration backfiring from a pinhole exhaust leak somewhere

2) CV joints on the way out.
