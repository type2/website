Hi

    Jensen might help out with this.  Although not likely.

Red or anything with an inline fuse will be hot.
Sometimes other accessories run from the radio
hot line (like power antenna) so if you have
other lines that are bundled with the hot wire you can just
tape them up.

The ground on most of their stuff is black, although you might
also find it is brown.

The rest of the wires are speaker wires (unless it was designed
to use another power amp/booster.

Without a wiring diagram you kinda have to use the trial and
error method.  Get some speakers ready and keep the volume
down cause if you run the unit too long without enough resistance
the unit will be damaged.

10 wires is about right....means it has a floating ground
(ie two wires to each speaker and a hot wire and a ground
wire for the unit.

Worse case go to some department store that has similar
models stacked up in boxes and peak at the wiring diagram
or the little paper tags that are stuck on the end of the harness.

Good Luck

&gt; lines just hanging there. plus is doesnt turn on, i hvnt checked the inline
&gt; fuse yet though. any thoughts?
