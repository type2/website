Subject: RE: [T2] Decison -opinions needed

Bite the bullet James. A bus like this will not come often. If you are to
have a bus, ask yourself why. To get greasy and hurt your hands? To be blown
away out of town by some copper who doesn't like the look of it? To be
endlessly parting with bux.? OR... to drive a design landmark in great
condition and cause that same copper to smile as you go past. They will
eventually cost the same money, so check it out big time, if it is true grab
it and run away laughing.

PS be nice to the old bus.
