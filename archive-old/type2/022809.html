I think the one you're talking about is made by jurgens(sp?) but there where 
a few  companies who did such conversions. check out my 65 at 
http://hometown.aol_dot_com/disconcerter/65rv.html


&lt;&lt; he beast of which you speak is of South African origin.They are a
 caravan thingy built on a Transporter Single Cab with the pickup
 bed removed and a walk-thru created between cab and caravan.
 A small number made their way to Oz as private imports since SA is
 also RHD.One has lived near me for many years now and I have been
 told by the owner that there is only a handful of them in the country,
 maybe 5 or so.Current owner bought it locally a few years back for
 (I think) $6000Aus.Certainly their rarity makes it a collectable...
 
 Nice idea but a real bugger in winds to drive.The one I know even has
 all matching crockery etc with the manufacturer's name printed on it.
 Everything has it's own place to live and all the plates are fastened
 down so nothing gets thrown around (especially when it's windy!)
 
 Access to the engine is wonderful.It has a rear access hatch similar
 to a Type2 but also,if you remove the rear bed/seat from in the caravan,
 you can literally climb into the engine bay.Handy for all those regular
 re-builds from pushing all that wind resistace along...;)
 
 Grab it if you can before someone else does!
