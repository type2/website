Subject: Re: [T2] Best bang for the buck tires.

Terry,

Arrgggh....several years ago the Y356 tires were thought(by the list) to 
be pretty good.

Close up view here :http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/newbus/picture-005.html

Hmmm..but seems I specifically remember that mine were load range &quot;d&quot;

So what the heck happened?

The ones on my 78 seem fabulous to me.  No funny wear patterns.
And in the rain, they stop as good or *better* than on the dry.
A panic stop at 50mph in the rain will absolutely make red stripes on your 
body from the seatbelts.  My wife and I tested this several years ago
on a trip to get a Christmas tree from the local store.

And compared to much more expensive tires on several other
cars I have on the same roads, they are *not* &quot;hard&quot;...of course, maybe I 
am just weird, cause I think my KYB gas shocks are &quot;soft&quot;...and Richard 
thinks they are hard as rocks....


What part of &quot;wet&quot; do you have a problem with?
Hydroplaning?  Stopping? Turning?
Deep water?


Cheers, dave

&gt; &lt;&lt;Probably the Yokohama Y356 in load range C if you are only going by
&gt; price. $58/tire at Tire Rack right now.&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; This is right on the top of the worst new tire's I have ever
&gt; purchased--Hands down.
&gt; Had them siped at Discount tire a,d they still were terrible in the wet
&gt; &amp; snow.
&gt; An awfully hard riding tire, and short winded--22-3,000 miles and they
&gt; were done.
&gt;
&gt; They wear real funny--the outboard edges--maybe 2&quot; on the inside &amp;
&gt; outside of the tread wears off---bald first, the inside still has some
&gt; tread left.
&gt;
&gt; Phooey.
&gt;
&gt; These Cooper's I am very happy with.
