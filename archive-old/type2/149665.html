&gt; Is this hose the same as the baywindow version (c shaped with braided 
&gt; covering) ? The last time I was at the junkyard looking at a Vanagon I saw 
&gt; a slightly smaller rubber hose in that shape with no braid (part number 
&gt; clearly stamped on the outside so no braid from the beginning).
&gt;
&gt; I forgot the part number and didn't take a photo. Does anyone know that 
&gt; original part number?
&gt;

I went outside to compare the Vanagon to my 75 bus. The inside diameter of 
the hose is the same on both, 9/16 inch. Sorry, no metric caliper. Bus Boys 
part number is N20371.03. The picture in their catalog shows a piece of hose 
a couple inches long attached to the decel valve at one end and attached to 
the plastic tube that connects to the rubber Y fitting on the intake plenum 
that the brake booster vacuum line also attaches to. I think my plastic tube 
was broken before I bought the bus because it is just a straight piece about 
4 inches long. Consiquently the rubber hose has to be longer to reach from 
the plastic tube to the decel valve.

I believe that the bay window version would work on the Vanogon with a 
little trimming. The decel valve on my 75 is mounted to the firewall, to the 
right of center when viewed from the rear of the bus. The valve on the 
Vanagon is to the left of center when viewed from the same location. The 
plastic tube on the 75 is S shaped, whereas the plastic tube on the Vanagon 
is supposed to be like an inverted L shape. It looks as though the S shaped 
tube would work if it were rotated to point to the left instead of the 
right.

In the end what I am looking for is a piece of hose about 6&quot; long with a 
9/16 inch inside diameter that is suitable for vacuum hose. It doesn't need 
to be original, just needs to not leak and not fall apart from heat or fuel 
vapors etc.
