Subject: '74-'75 Westy interior layouts

Ron, actually white '75 Westy's were standards ( mine is) .  I believe there
were 2 color options in '74, the oranges being the standards and having orange
plaid upholstry , orange front doorpanels, orange poptop canvas, orange carpets,
orange paint, oarnge plaid 4 legged stool, and even an orange childs cot!!
(hammock)  I even believe they came standard with a six pack of Sunkist in the
icebox. :&lt;)  The other color option in '74 was the Yosemite Yellow  (aka
Psychadelic flourescent yellow) which was the deluxe model, and had the blue and
green plaid upholstry, (IMO the nicest plaid - too bad they didn't offer that
plaid on the '76-'79's)  Both '74 and '75 Deluxes had the fridge/propane stove
unit right in your friggin' face as you opened up the sliding door, or right
behind the front pass. seat  (as you can see  I'm not a fan of the pre '76 Westy
layouts - can't carry a pancake motor in the cargo floor of the earlier ones
without removing the damn icebox!)    The '74's were the last year for the left
wall hinged flip up table, the'75 deluxes had a removeable plaid upholstered
console box that could be strapped inbetween the front seats ( I'm not sure if
the '74's had the console box since all '74's had the 4 legged stool standard,
and both the console box and a 4 legged stool would take up too much floor room)
and both '74 and '75 deluxes had a dash mounted removeable table and post, that
stored behind the drivers seat. the Yellow deluxes also had  matching color
poptop canvas, almost the same color as the paint. The  '75's also had a rear
facing jump seat on the drivers side, behind the sink cabinet. '74's and '75's
also had the notouious user unfriendly &quot;inflatable spare tire&quot; which was stored
at the bottom of the sink cabinet laying down, ( first you had to remove the
cabinet door to get the tire out, and then you had to plug the air compressor
into the mystery outlet under the glove box - I've only seen two things fit in
there - the elusive '74/'75 air compressor, and a elusive cigar lighter - both
european only plugs- and then you had to wait 2 hours while sitting on the side
of the freeway with huge semi's barreling past you at breakneck speeds,nearly
blowing your little westy off that piddly little &quot;jack&quot;, wondering when it was
going to finish inflating,and then finally giving up and flagging down a tow
truck - which is why the inflatable spare tire out of my '75 was NEVER used) and
the small air compressor for the spare tire, which was stored in that small
compartment on the outside of the icebox, between the icebox and the sliding
door, with the little hinged table-like lid. Oh, the deluxes also had the
exterior city water hookup outlet.

Both '74 and '75 deluxes were the Yosemite Yellow, and aside from some changes
like the position of the table,jumpseat and the console box, the layouts were
pretty much the same.

In '75 the standards were white,and had the blue green plaid interior, green
front door panels, and the poptop canvas was the same color as it was on the
deluxes - flourescent yellow. 

Yeah Ok, I'll quit blabbin'
