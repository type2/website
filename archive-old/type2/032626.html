Subject: Re: Cigarette Lighter Woes

My two cents:

Don't know about stock or in-line fuses, but my old cigarette lighter in
my bus had that same little &quot;spark plug wire&quot; attachment for the power,
which was the first time I'd ever seen anything like it. I just replaced
the whole thing with a standard universal cigarette lighter from my
FLAPS, splicing flat push-on connectors to the existing wires.
Everything works fine. Sounds like you might want to replace the whole
wire, though.

BUT -- I just bought a boat version cigarette lighter for the 12V plug
in the cabin, which has a little removable map light in place of a
lighter element, and what should I see but that little spark plug
arrangement for the power wire! So, if you don't want to futz with
splicing your wires, you could look for that marine-style setup. I got
mine at KMart in the boating supplies section, and it came with the
female connector to splice to the existing power wire.

I guess that hook-up is just a variation.

&gt; a round, female connector (similar to a small spark plug wire)
&gt; that attaches at a 90 degree angle to the end of the lighter assembly.
