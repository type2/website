It would help if more info was given. In this case, 3 different AFM's will
work, depending if this is a Cal version or Fed version bus.
0280 200 030 = 80-83 Cal
0280 200 025 = 80 Cal [subs to the 030]
0280 200 038 = 83 Fed

And which 79 do you have to trade?
0280 200 020 = 78 + 79 Fed
0280 200 022 = 79 Cal
