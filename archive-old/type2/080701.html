Subject: Big clutch nightmare!!

I just finished installing my rebuilt AVP 2000cc engine in my 72 Westy. On
the suggestion of GoWesty I went with the bigger clutch AND flywheel, the
228mm.

Well now I am trying to start my engine for the first time and the starter
&quot;fires&quot; but it won't engage or turn the engine. The engine went in fine.

Is this because I have a starter for my 72 (210mm flywheel) and now I have a
bigger clutch? I sure hope so. Do I have to get a different starter?

The starter doesn't spin freely, but its also not turning the engine. We
can't seem to turn the engine over with a wrench either!!

Thanks for the help!

Here are some pics I put up now that its in. However I can't get it to
start:
