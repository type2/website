&gt;I will accept the flack on this...... You don't need no stinking second
&gt;solenoid. Its a patch not a fix.
&gt;------------------------------

(Here's a flack jacket for you, Stan. Good line!!) 

Just as the relay kits are a panacea for old wires.
Wires/terms/switches/solinoids/armatures/brushes/bearings get resistant
with age, just like us. &quot;click-click&quot; for start is many times a synergy of
weaknesses throughout the circuit.  The closer you are to stock, the better
your &quot;luck&quot; (pocket book) is in the future. Patching is for getting back
home so you can remove the offense with proper follow up repair. Most/all
the time/money spent on patching is no longer available to fix it right. So
patching is for emergencies only, like when brokedown in Gooberburg. 

Let's say I'm 2000 miles from home and suddenly, &quot;click-click&quot; no starter.
Let's say I determine that the starter solinoid is showing it's age as
resistance and must be replaced to fix it properly, but I can't get a REAL
one in Hicksville until too late for my needs, and I most needs to not
spend three days in Elroy and Mona's Kafe with the local-necks that hang
out there and have fun makin' fun of &quot;furren&quot; cars at your expense. I would
go to NAPA and get a pushbutton and 20 feet of 10ga wire and terminals and
make up direct connections at the starter, just run the wires on the floor
to between the front seats for the pushbutton. Now I have guaranteed lower
voltage drop than the old wires/terms to actuate the old starter
dependably, and have spent only $20/20 minutes. Then pop in a new/reman
BOSCH starter when I get home, and take off the jurusrigusmortus and
salvage the hardware for future value in some way so the jerryricketsmongus
is not a total loss. Like maybe then actually replacing the old switch
wires properly shielded and routed to remove another weakness to insure
longer life for the new starter.
