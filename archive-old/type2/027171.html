Hello:

I will soon be replacing my 1600 dual port engine with a brand new longblock 
from Bus Depot for my 70 Camper. However, I was wondering if anyone could 
offer up some advice regarding other things I should consider doing to the 
bus as well while putting in the new engine, such as a new oil cooler, etc 
etc. etc. I plan to take the bus on an extended cross-country trip in about 
12 months and want the girl to be as ready as possible. Thanks in advance 
for any suggestions....

Will
