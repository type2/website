George, how about us folks who aren't worried about all this power,lthat
just want to keep our Busses running and not lugging the motor, but
certainly want to enjoy the ride and not just get there and start HAVING
FUN,FUN,FUN! You know, &quot;hurry Up And Wait? I try to respect most people
that I meet, but have little patience with those around us who can't
&quot;spare the time to live&quot;..... And make it their goal in life(short as it
may be) to blow everyone else off the road in the eternal search for
'fun,fun,fun&quot; or whatever they're &quot;minds&quot;can conjure up.
 hope I don't keep someone from owning and enjoying the most loved/hated
vehicle ever designed by men. It's just that I think that a person who
wants to redline his Bus every time he or she shifts needs to be driving
a Chevy Van!

My .021/2.

Chris.

&gt; &gt; I looked at the Bentley specs.  Is there any point in revving the engine
&gt; &gt; above the peak horsepower rating?  If not, then it would appear I would get
&gt; &gt; no benefit from revving my 1976 FI stock engine above 4200 RPM?
