Subject: Re: [T2] VW Type 1 List

On several of the groups I sometimes find the bickering interesting as 
well.  I then try to find out why individuals can become so &quot;set&quot; on 
their choices (note i dont use opinion).  I have found that i can gain a 
wealth of knowledge by researching out the &quot;discussion&quot;.  I see the same 
choice modes here but the bicker part is usually more controlled here.

&gt; It's pretty quiet these days, some of the more opinionated
&gt; folks have moved on, so bickering hasn't been a problem, but
&gt; it does exist occasionally. You can pmail, you just
&gt; have to take the extra step of copying and pasting
&gt; the recipient's address.  Not much hassle compared to the
&gt; things we run into when working on our VWs. =20
&gt;
&gt; IMHO, the occasional bickering is worth the wealth of knowledge
&gt; that is present.
