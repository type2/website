Subject: louvered window knob(s)

Hello list,

I have a friend who needs a louvered window knob. I
also need one if any one has 2. If you only have one,
that would be great. I don't have to have one at the
moment. If you are looking for somthing in particular
and I have it, I would be willing to trade or I can
just pay you. Any way, I just thought I would ask.

Have a great day!

David Kelly
