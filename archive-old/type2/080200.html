I can think about one major problem w/ it. normal w/c engines circulate
the coolant through the block not the exhaust manifold. Assuming that
our exhaust heat is over the boiling point of the water/coolant then
suddenly we are wanting to make the liquid become a gas. w/ a higher
pressure I imagine. Boom. no more, or what if some steam made it back
into the head reverse path through the exhaust valves.

&gt; Any such thing as an electric pump that would deal with the recirculation 
&gt; duties?

I don't know if such a beast exists (at least a 12v one) would suck a
lot if it went out since most other w/c cars power the waterpump via a
mechanical link from the crankshaft (i.e., belt).
