Subject: Re: busses, environmental degradation

A few friends in Germany retrofitted their cars with catalytic converters.
Don't remember whether they did so voluntarily (eco-sensitivity is much
higher in Germany than in any other country I've visited), whether the
government had offered incentives, or whether they just simply had to. In
any event, it's must be technically feasible.

Question: to retrofit my '75 fuel injected bus with a cat, do I
necessarily also need the lambda sensor, hence a new brain, new wire
harness, etc? What about cats for carburated engines?

Has anyone explored their options on type1 engines as well? 

Thanks,

Sami ('75 Westf.)
