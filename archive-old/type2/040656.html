Subject: Lights warning beeper

Yesterday I fitted a &quot;lights on warning beeper&quot; to my  '81 vanagon.

I did a little write up on it. I don't think you would ever see an easier
step by step description on how to do it yourself that this one

If someone can tell me the fuse #'s to connect to for a Bay-window bus I can
amend the procedure to suit both types.
