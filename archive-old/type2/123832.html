Subject: RE: [T2] Re: CHT Gauge Accuracy

&gt;&gt;&gt; I have recently found these gauges for aircraft, and think they may
benefit us. re cyls with the dual models, and one reads as a four? &lt;&lt;&lt;

Ooooh, and some NICE oil coolers their too. How many external oil
coolers do ya' think a person could run without upgrading the oil pump?
Mwhahahhahaha

Cheers
Chris
