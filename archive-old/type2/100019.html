Subject: RE: [T2] Weird Brake problem.

Okay, I did not replace everything but I did replace all the wheel
cylinders, fluid, shoes, and rubber hoses. With brand new parts.

Remember I only have to drive it for the problem to occur it does not occur
from repeated use of the brakes.

&gt;&gt; I replaced all the brake components except the steel lines and MC. I bled
&gt;&gt; the brakes and have a nice firm pedal but. . .

&gt;Did you...there are a lot of parts.

&gt;&gt; If I drive it for a while the brakes get harder and harder, effectively
&gt;&gt; reducing the play in my brake pedal until there is none and the brakes
start
&gt;&gt; to self-apply. This occurs not continued use of the brakes, as I can be
&gt;&gt; cruising down the freeway and not using them at all. It just happens
while I
&gt;&gt; drive. I can get 10 miles or so before the brakes start applying. I can
&gt;&gt; relieve the pressure and continue by adjusting the brake pedal plunger
&gt;&gt; itself.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I'm certain that it is not expanding air in the lines as there is no
&gt;&gt; sponginess to the pedal ever.

&gt;Air in the system or old brake fluid does not cause this problem.  I had 10
&gt;year old fluid and never had the rear brakes lock up like this.
&gt;
&gt;What your problem is symptomatic of is old rubber brake hoses, long beyond
&gt;their life span, that swell and collapse on the inside and keep pressure
&gt;applied to the brakes.

&gt;Did you replace them?
