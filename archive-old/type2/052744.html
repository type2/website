Subject: Re: [T2] Turnkey, Fuel Injected, New Mexican VW engines...

I have been wondering about this lately. Does anyone know how
much, say, new cases cost in Mexico? 150 bucks? What prevents
one from mailing a few of these beauties back for personal use?
Practically speaking, mind you, not &quot;gubment regalations&quot;. And,
assuming a favorable answer, is anyone planning a trip to Mexico
soon :^)

&gt; well one way is to drive to Mexico and have the van &quot;Repaired&quot; by
having
&gt; a new engine installed.  Then just drive home....
&gt; it does work.  ask me how I know?!?!
