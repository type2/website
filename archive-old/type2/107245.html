&gt;I have gotta say, the folks at tirerack_dot_com are on the ball...and nice to

I must concur. I ordered 4 tires. 2 showed up as expected. Checked with 
them via e-mail. Within a few hours they found them shipped to one of their 
approved installers in a burg 100 miles north. They got reshipped to me and 
arrived in the next day or two. They responded to every e-mail, and I had 
the feeling that it was but minutes for them to keep me updated to events 
as they occurred. Just exactly the way you want to be treated. Just a bit 
rare today from large volume weborder businesses.

Best possible service at discount pricing. Truely concerned for fixing 
glitches. No wonder their successful. Neither do you get gouged on the 
shipping fees. If I recall the 4 tires shipped as 2 parcels of pairs lashed 
together was $30 at 4 days and many states away. They do appear to be 
passing on much of the savings from their volume shipping contracts with 
UPS/FEDEX/ETC.
