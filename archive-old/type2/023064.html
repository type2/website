Subject: Re: [T2] Debugging an Engine that's running Hot


&gt;Hypothesis #2:
&gt;
&gt;Fuel Pump not pushing enough fuel and the engine is running lean as a result.

The engine won't run lean from a bad fuel pump.  It is a more or less 
binary relationship with the engine either running if there is fuel in the 
bowl or not running if there is not.  You can run with no pump at all if 
your fuel source is 1&quot; higher than the bowl of the carb.

&gt;I don't think the fuel filter being &quot;empty&quot; while the engine is running is
&gt;really indicative of anything, but everytime I look at it, I wonder...
&gt;Is this indicative of anything?

It is indicative of there being air trapped in the filter.  :-)  Try 
priming it maybe?

&gt;I really figure the fluctuating idle means i have an idle leak
&gt;somewhere, but the only hose i haven't replaced (and which i should be
&gt;replacing this weekend) is the last 1' booster hose (between the metal
&gt;tubing and the brake booster itself).

Plug it at the manifold and see if that helps.  I haven't had that much 
experience diagnosing hunting idle problems but I would suspect it is due 
to variations in timing.

&gt;Do I need the vacuum gauge to be directly connected to the manifold, in-line
&gt;with the brake booster hose but before the check valve (as per schwarze in
&gt;the archive)?

I am schwarze so I say yes!  :)  No really, it doesn't matter where you 
connect it as long as it leads to the manifold.

&gt;I thought that hooking it up inline with the dizzy vacuum
&gt;lines would at least give me some &quot;first pass&quot; information on what is
&gt;going on, but with readings under 5 cm3 of vacuum, either i have a
&gt;huge leak or this isn't an effective test method.  The only other
&gt;place I can think of for a vacuum leak would be a carb bushing, or...???

I don't really understand your readings.  You should have somewhere between 
12-18 in. of vacuum at the vacuum retard port (manifold) at idle with 
everything hooked up.  Don't worry about vacuum advance readings because it 
is also a function of manifold vacuum (but you shouldn't have any at idle 
OR WOT).

Any ideas on what i'm missing here folks?  I would like to believe that it's
&gt;just a vacuum leak that i have somewhere, but, if it is, it's doing a good
&gt;job of hiding and i'm at my wits end trying to find it.

A trip to the chassis dyno (with wideband O2 sensor hookup) would tell you 
exactly what is going on with the engine.  Might be worth the 50 bucks to 
just take it in and have it done.  It will also tell you exactly how much 
horsepower your bus is putting down to the rear wheels, which is kinda 
cool.  Mine makes 60.
