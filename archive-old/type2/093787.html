Subject: Re: [T2] Dometic fridge in 78-79

I usually toss in a couple of those gel freezer packs into mine to take 
up space with something that is already frozen and as you said no water 
mess.  Dry ice is by far the best solution i have seen but it is darned 
hard to find usually.

&gt; There is another trick that can be used, if you can get dry ice. Freeze
&gt; everything you can and load up an ordinary picnic ice chest with frozen
&gt; goods, then put the dry ice on top, and a towel or something over that 
&gt; (lids
&gt; on ice chests usually have pretty poor insulation). That dry ice will
&gt; probably maybe four days, and it will get the food in the freezer SO 
&gt; cold
&gt; that even when the dry ice is long gone, it may still remain frozen for
&gt; days. The best part is that there is no melted icewater mess to deal 
&gt; with,
&gt; and as you take each frozen food item out to use, you can put it in to 
&gt; the
&gt; refrigerator, which will help to cool down the rest of the fresh food 
&gt; and
&gt; take the load off your refrigerator. Jan B
