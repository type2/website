&quot;The salesman had told me he thought they would be Mahle Brazil which
are frankly the only sets I've
really seen in engines I've torn down, but they end up Cofap which is
apparently Kobelshmidt (sp?) Brazil, or at least bought the KS mold
cores, the KS is there and you can see where the Germany marks are
removed.&quot;

Last time I was shopping around for P&amp;Cs, I was told that Mahle had
bought Cofap or vice versa.

&quot;I like the fact very much that these have the &quot;2 part&quot; oil control
ring, I HATE the &quot;3 part&quot; style with the wavy metal thing and two flimsy
little ring parts, these have a spring behind one nice solid iron ring
as god intended.&quot;

Last time I bought P&amp;Cs it was an asian 94mm set I got from MSHP for
$189.  This set used the three part oil ring.  I don't know if it was me
or the parts, but when i broke the engine down after about 1000 miles, I
could see that the end of one of the &quot;two flimsy little ring parts&quot;
(John describes it perfectly) had been digging into the wall of the
cylinder, leaving a nice groove.  I was so depressed that the engine
simply went into boxes in my basement, and my spare 2.0 liter that leaks
like a sieve and has severely heat-impaired heat exchangers has been in
my '74 ever since.  Anyway, I've got three pretty nice 94mm P&amp;Cs, so I'd
like to get a fourth good one, or get rid of the three to somebody who
needs 1-3 of 'em.

Actually, I don't think that the groovy cylinder was the source of the
noise that caused me to break down the engine after its inaugural drive
&gt;from Warrensburg, Missouri to Baltimore, MD.  That honor goes to the new
hydraulic camshaft/lifters, which I got from Web Cam.  There was heavy
cam bearing wear on the left and right extremities of the cam bearings,
which is to say, towards the center of each half circle, as if the cam
was pressing there, but not upward or downward so as to wear on the ends
of the half circles.  Two theories: (1) the gaskacincy I used created
too thick a film build between the two halves of the crankcase, or (2)
the cam gear was mounted on the camshaft slightly off center.  This
possibility occurred to me recently while lying in bed awake, nearly a
year and a half later, as I recalled that the bolt holes in the gear
(the stock gear machined by Web Cam) didn't line up perfectly with the
holes in the end of the cam.  Why I didn't worry about (2) at the time,
I don't know, but I was in a rush to finish (I got it running and drove
off to Baltimore from MO without so much as a test drive), and I
supposed I fell into thinking that those guys at Web Cam must know what
they are doing, being pros, and I don't know squat.  Well, I proved the
later, it seems.  Oh, and regarding theory (2), I should add that the
lifters had strange wear on their cam contact faces, such that there was
a kind of &quot;X&quot; pattern on them.
