Subject: Vacuum canister need it

Hello guys

I am looking for a vacuum canister part number 211905 271 B, I have been
searching the web, the ETKA files  and my library but could not find even
the part number mentioned, this vacuum canister is for my 1200 cc 1965 bug,
as additional info the part of the canister rod meets the point plate is a
ball joint, if anyone have one around and want to sale it please contact me.

Thanks

Roberto
