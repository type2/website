Subject: Help refurbing F. I. harness

What is the best methode for removing the plastic connectors from the ends of
the wires of the fuel inj. harness. I've done this before but cant remember
wich side the latch that holds the contact is on. I'm trying to remove some
good injector connectors from a 78 donor harness to restore my 80 harness.
