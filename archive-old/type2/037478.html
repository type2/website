Subject: Re: Light warning system.

There is a simple fix for your problem.  Most electronics parts houses (read
Radio Shack) carry a type of alarm similar to the brand &quot;Sonalert&quot; . It may
be refered to as a solid state buzzer or a piezo alarm.  Usually about 1.5 &quot;
in diameter and 2&quot; long.  It will have 2 wires, one marked + and the
other -.They operate over a wide voltage (3 - 24) and draw little current
(important, about 20 mA).  Crawl under your dash and find a wire that is hot
when the ignition is on.  Then find a wire from your light switch that comes
on when the running lights are on.  Now here is the part that sounds wierd:
wire the + lead to the running light wire, and connect the - to the ignition
wire.  Thats all there is to it.  What happens is that when you leave your
lights on, the Sonalert will get it's + from that switch and the ignition
wire will effectively supply the ground when it is off through other loads
that are connected to it.  When both are supplied with + (key on), it will
do nothing.  You will probably want to cover the open end of the Sonalert
with something as they can be very loud.
Works great for me.

&gt;
&gt; OK, question #1::  Is there an easy way to wire the parking lights to the
&gt; head lights, so that all my lights go off when I shut the key off??  This
is
&gt; the 'umpteenth time I left my parking lights on.
