I gotta go with Shelby on this one... let the bus talk to you... maybe an 
experience you've had with the bus. I believe you can't really name a bus 
until you've been in it, so I'll pass on any suggestions... except that I 
usually name my things (pets, etc.) after songs or lyrics... even have a cat 
named Esther from the Phish song....
