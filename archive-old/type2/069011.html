Subject: Tool FAQ additoins

        Brass drift for bearning races

        Sharpie marking pen, yellow or white crayon

        Q-tips for cleaning

        Latex or vinyl gloves

        Eye protection

        Respirator/dust-mask

        Baking soda

        String

        Anti-seize

        Left-handed drills for pilot holes for easy-outs

        Oil filter wrenches (for lucky type IV owners) either 3/8&quot; drive
style OR cup-with-spiral-up style

        Little bottle of white, yellow and red paint for timing marks.

        Tire valve tool

        I always carry a 'tool kit' spark=plug tool which is the perfect
fit in the threaded plastic plug that goes into the bell-housing of
Rabbits, Golfs, etc. You remove the plug to see the timing marks.
