Subject: '72 vacuum line question

Hi fellow Bussees,

Perhaps one (or more) of you can resolve a long-standing puzzlement of
mine: on my '72 Westfalia, with stock 1700, the rubber elbow connecting
the left-hand intake manifold to the metal balance pipe/brake booster
vacuum takeoff has a small (5 or 6mm ?) tee on it.  Ever since I've
owned the Bus, I've wondered just what that little tee was supposed to
attach to... it's always just been plugged up with the tip of a golf
tee.  But I have never seen or heard an explanation -- not in Bently,
not in Muir, not in the archives, not ever!  All the vacuum lines on my
carbs, distributor, air cleaner, etc. appear to be routed reasonably,
and as far as I can tell correctly.

Anyone care to take a crack at it?  All guesses appreciated!

Thanks,

-chad
