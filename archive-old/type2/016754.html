Subject: Weber Carbs and buses

To answer Danno (well, almost answer anyway)

Weber carbs were not specifically designed for VW buses!  They were designed for Aston 
Martins, Lotus', Jaguars, BMWs, Porsches and classic Italian automobiles.  

They are, however known the world over for their versatility.  They can be &quot;tuned&quot; to 
run almost anything.  The reason for this is their parts replacement design, found in 
few other carburetors anywhere.  In other words you can end up reconfiguring just about 
every part of the carburetor installation.

The progressive family of Webers include the following models:

DAF,DAR,DCB
DCD,DCHD,DCHE
DDC.DDE
DHS,DHSA
DF,DFAV,DFD
DFE,DFM,DFV,DFH
DGV,DGAV,DFT
DFTA,DMTR,DATR
DHS,DHSI,DHSIA
DHSA
DIC,DIF,DIR
ICF

The simultaneous family of Webers include the following models:

DAS,DCS,DCZ
DFA,DFB
DFAV
DGAS
DFA,DFI,DFO

BTW: dc means doppio corpo (double-throat)
     v means verticale (you figure it out)
     o means orizzontale (the opposite of the above)
