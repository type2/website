Subject: Re: [T2] 3 person rear seat- meant to say full width

&gt; &gt;My '71 station wagon came with some sort of mechinism that converts
&gt; &gt;the rear seat into a bed.  I don't know if this is a factory feature
&gt; &gt;though.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I have seem quite a few of these lately. They vary slightly in design
&gt; but are generally the same. After trying the figure out where they
&gt; came from no one seemed to know until DaveE told me they were a
&gt; common fixture in after-market catalogs such as JC Wh!tney.  I also
&gt; ran accross an NOS kit on E-barf earlier this year.  I do not recall
&gt; who the manufacturer was but it was not VW. I wold be fairly easily
&gt; for a competent metal worker to copy one.
