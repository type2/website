Subject: The '77 bagged it's first deer.....
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Well.... My '77 got its first deer last night.....

Anybody got any suggestions concerning what I should DEFINATELY keep to use on
the '79?  I know i'll keep the engine/tranny.  Probably the bear bench seat.
Most of the interior electronics, etc.  I plan on stripping everything I can
before junking the body.

Like I said... any suggestions, etc. would be appreciated.
