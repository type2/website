Subject: Re: [T2] Side Mirror Removal

Chris, 

If yours are  the same as mine on my 78, then you are supposed to be able 
to turn it and have it come out.

Simplest thing to do is take your door panel off, roll the window up, and 
then just look....I'm betting that the &quot;captive&quot; nut on the inside is just 
not captive any more and just spinning around.

Cheers, dave

&gt; The &quot;bolt&quot; is on the outside of the door. It's round, but has either
&gt; side shaved flat so you can fit a wrench over it. I can turn it, it's
&gt; hard, but it turns. I can KIND OF see the inside of the door where it's
&gt; spinning, but I can't tell if that's a bolt on the inside too or what.
&gt; No WAY can any of my tools reach in their to grab ahold of whatever it
&gt; is.
