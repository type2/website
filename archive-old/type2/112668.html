Subject: Re: [T2] VW Hippie Bashing

It's George's job, but IIRC he's very busy dealing with the real 
world... I seem to recall that this thread officially ended at midnight 
Friday night.  It's past that time in all Earthen time zones.  Can we 
end it please? Before one of our more valued contributors gets 
themselves banned.

Thanks.

Jim
