Subject: Re: [T2] Battery corrosion

Vincent,

Battery corrosion (on the terminals) is caused by the
&quot;acid mist&quot; hydrogen that gasses off the battery when
the acid bubbles a little under normal charging. It's
corrosive (contains some hydrochloric acid) so it will
attack terminals, and anything else nearby..

You can use petroleum jelly, or those felt thingy's
that were mentioned, but if it's really bad it could
be caused by excessive gassing:

1) Is your battery (distilled) water/acid too low?
   (Check and top up as needed - But don't overfill)
2) Is your generator/alt overcharging the battery?
   (Does anyone know how to easily check this?)

If you're fed up dealing with a lead-acid battery, you
could always try a sealed &quot;gel&quot; battery (Eg:optimax),
these are expensive, but they don't give off a &quot;mist&quot;
the same way. I just put one on my BMW motorcycle and
it works great, and holds a charge longer too!

Hope it helps, and thanks to all who responded to my
posting for local parts. What a great group!
