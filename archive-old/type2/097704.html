&lt;&lt; It is not really neccessary to cut an access hole for the fuel sender. &gt;&gt;

I second that!  Once you've loosened the panel in front of the engine and 
moved teh top of it back, the sender is removed from the top of the tank by 
giving it less than a quarter of a turn and then lifting it up, to the side 
and out.  Reverse the process to install the new one.
