&gt; &gt; well I've now tried all the offered suggestions with absolutely no
&gt; &gt; results.  wish I had a spare AFM (anyone near Baltimore willing to lend me

I don't think the AFM is different.

&gt; you didn't offer any stats.. so I assume your fuel pressure and vac readings
&gt; are within spec?
