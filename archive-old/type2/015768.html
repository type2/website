Blake, Harmon and all,

From my point of wiew VW wasn't that strict with the transition between
model years, at least not in the European markets. In the &quot;border years&quot;
like 1967-1968, 1970-1971 and 1971-1972 there are always some &quot;bastard
busses&quot; with mixes of both versions. Here in Finland we could always get
NOS Busses from last year. In the registration documents a 1971 bus could
become a 1972. My 1974 German made Bug have swing axels and the old style
front suspension. It could be confused for a 1969 if it wasn't for the
modern engine hood.

Let us not upset ourselves with these differences, let us enjoy them!

Vive la difference!

&gt;Ed. note- There was nothing that matched up to this bellhousing mount
&gt;attached to the bus AT ALL. So no use for a rear trans hanger.  Sure would
&gt;be nice, tho.  
&gt;
&gt;Moral: '68-71, no original rear trans support.  On US models at least
&gt;(can't speak for others).  '72-79, supports on bellhousing.  
&gt;
&gt;Any corroborative evidence?
