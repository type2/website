Subject: RE: [T2] Battery

Michael,
There is a metal plate that bolts into the pan of the battery tray
that secures the battery to the battery tray.  Most of the buses
that I have seen with the bungee method of battery security have
boards under their battery's because their battery trays are rusted
out.  Is your battery tray intact?

&gt; right now I
&gt; have a bungy (?spelling?) cord keeping my battery from
&gt; moving.  Any
&gt; Ideas on the subject.
&gt; Michael...
