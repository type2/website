&gt; My search of the archives returned overwhelming posts, most of them not
&gt; relevant. I'll go back and see if I can narrow it down a bit.

I will forward on any posts I have to have saved from when I posted a question
about this a while back.

&gt; As for the hydraulics, the bus is for my 16 year old son who wants to take a
&gt; mega-tour next summer. I am going to convert to hydraulics and electronic
&gt; ignition, and tune it to a gnats hair so he'll just have to do the lube and
&gt; tire pressure checks and the regular oil change/lube job as normal
&gt; maintenance. The cost of hydraulics is cheap insurance for me and his mom ;-)

On the other hand, teaching him how to set the valves (as part of the whole tune
up routine as in the John Muir &quot;idiot&quot; book) is even cheaper, and could have the
salutary side effect of changing his relationship to the bus (and cars in
general, perhaps) from one of alienated inattention, which characterizes most
drivers today, to empowered interest.  If he comes to think of the bus as
intricate and fragile, he's more likely to acquire and even cultivate the kind
of attentiveness to its myriad noises and rhythms that is so useful in a vehicle
that (like any old vehicle) is prone to break down.  Are you planning to install
any gauges?  Listees will tell you to go with oil pressure, voltmeter, and oil
temperature, in that order, I'd guess.  Oil pressure especially is critical info
to have, and if the temp goes up, the pressure will go down.  A 16 year old boy
will want a tach, probably.  :  )  And for safety on the highway, I'd want a
bus-driving child of mine to have good C or D load range tires, to give the
beast stability on the road.  Oh, and buy him some tools!

&gt; I've never heard any report that says stock tubular aluminum pushrods are good
&gt; enough for use with hydraulics. It seems that you might have had
&gt; experience with this item??? Everything I've read says get steel ones, but at
&gt; $15 each, I'd as soon do  with the stock ones if they are reliable.

Well, it's probably safe to say that the steel ones are better; but this is
another example of the kind of guesswork you are getting into when contemplating
cobbling together a late in the game engine modification.  How important is the
steel?  I can't say.  There are people who have done without.  I haven't heard
of anyone having a problem with the aluminum ones, but I don't know how many
listees have tried this, or if they had trouble they didn't report.

&gt; Oh, yes, half my pushrods have a slight shiny wear ring

Yeah, that's normal.  I'd like to know what causes it.  I think it must be oil
polished, somehow.

I forgot to mention that there are different higher tension valve springs for
use with the hydraulic lifters.  They are something like 210-220 lbs., instead
of 170-180 lbs., as I recall offhand.
