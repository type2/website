Subject: RE:  [T2]  Westy Interior Panel Patterns

Save it in 2000, it can be opened and re-saved in any format.

Or I can manipulate it into a few different formats if you send me the .dwg 
files.

Also with the university Internet connection I have I can re-send this out 
to anyone that asks with your approval very easily.

I just took an AutoCAD course this semester. I am working towards an 
engineering degree while I work as Library staff. In fact i am waiting for 
my final grades to be posted right now - it's making me very old!!!

See ya.

Chris

P.S. I might be able to get good measurements from my headliner, sliding 
door, and door panels this weekend and post the .dwg files Monday. This is 
will be for a '78 Westy. Would that be the same as ane arly baywindow?

&gt;How about this:
&gt;
&gt;I'll generate a basic AutoCad .dwg for the sliding door panel, as I think
&gt;that would be the easiest/best way to get all of the necessary dimensions to
&gt;you.   I'm no AutoCad expert, but I do use it in my work and know enough to
&gt;be dangerous.  What version - 2000, 14, 13....?
&gt;
&gt;I can plot it full size and check against my bus to be sure it fits.
&gt;
&gt;If you don't get any offers on the other panels I could check mine as best I
&gt;can without taking stuff apart to seriously.

&gt;
&gt;Actually I would be glad to make a full size (24&quot; X 36&quot;) set of blueprints
&gt;for all the 68-72 Westy interior birch panels for the VW community and even
&gt;the door panels and the kick panels too. I have most of the original pieces
&gt;and could make the prints on AutoCad, but I need 2 things:
&gt;
&gt;1) dimensions for the headliner, which I believe should be fabricated in 3
&gt;pieces. I also would need the dimensions for the driver's side panels. Russ
&gt;it would save me time if you could take some dimensions for the sliding
&gt;door. I have the rear deck lid panel and the trim pieces in the rear around
&gt;the spare tire.

&gt;
&gt;2) somebody to check the dimensions by actually using the blueprints before
&gt;making them available to the public.
&gt;
&gt;Anybody have those dimensions? A good way to check the dimensions is for
&gt;somebody to measure theirs against mine too.
