Subject: Needed: 78-ish Longblock

Mates,

My 78 Westy is in dire need of a transplant!  I just lost-out on a
near-perfect deal to a local buyer, so anyone out there with a longblock
sitting around please contact me.  Reasonable offers only.  Low miles and
good heads are a +plus+!

TIA,

Justin Smith
