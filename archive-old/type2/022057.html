i do know that it took me quite a while to reach teh mileage i have now.....i
compared a lot of manuals on how to set all the little screws on both of the
carbs......a lot of tinkering....but well worth it.........your extra weight
might just be the culprit.....when i load mine down i am about to where you
are in mileage.....hmmmm...you might be pretty close.
