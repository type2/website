    I have the ice box in my 73 but have never put ice in it.We use it for
dry storage and canned goods. Keeps bread fresh a few days too.
I would think dry ice would last the longest and if put in the ice tray
(remember to insure the drain hose is installed) should work well.
Don't let any food come in contact with the ice as it will freeze soild.
   We use dry ice at work to shrink turbine engine parts during hot section
overhauls and I sat a can of C*ke on a block for about a minute.
The can swelled and the pop was almost solid!
