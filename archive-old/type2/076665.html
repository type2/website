Subject: Re: [T2] Master Card Commercial

I hope they win and get a judgement with 19.5% interest and monthly late
charges. Additionally they should have a collection agency call the MC
executives each 10 days at their home at 8:46 PM and threaten to ruin
their credit.

&gt; In a lawsuit filed in federal court in Minneapolis, David Hoch and 
&gt; Joe
&gt; Marble accuse MasterCard and its ad agency of duplicating their 
&gt; 1998
&gt; documentary in a series of commercials.
