HHHHHhhmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!!

I live in the very hot desert, and our summer temps usually stay in the teens,
sometimes in the one twenties! Day and night. I never had any thoughts about
letting the engine &quot;cool off&quot; before shutting it down, and I've had several bugs
and busses over the  years. The main interest was always getting in the house
and air conditioning quickly,  for ME! and not the vehicle.  :-}

BTW, the &quot;90's&quot; is what we call &quot;Sweater Weather&quot;.

&gt; What I forgot to say (and thanks, guys, for catching this!) is *not* to turn
&gt; the motor off.  Otherwise, you are absolutely, positively correct... the
&gt; motor will heat up even farther than were you just driving.
&gt;
&gt; It's the same theory as the turbo in a diesel (bigrig) engine... it has to
&gt; cool down before you shut it down; that's why they idle them 3-5 minutes...
&gt; In fact, in those hot Sacto summers, this is not a bad idea, either, on your
&gt; bus.  Sometimes the outside temp doesn't drop below the 90's for days at a
&gt; time.
&gt;
&gt; I still stand by the stopping every hour or so, tho... just don't stop the
&gt; engine until it's cooled down!!!
