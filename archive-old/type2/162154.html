Subject: THANK YOU JEFF!!

I'd like to personally thank Jeff Stewart for moving JBB up a week  
from its usual &quot;second weekend in October&quot; slot.

If JBB had been scheduled for its usual week we'd have had to miss  
it: Buffalo got hit with two feet of snow yesterday and the Peace  
Bridge in Fort Erie has been closed all day.

BTW, I finally got the pics online, they're available here:

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
