Subject: '68 master cylinder kaput.... need one bad by thursday eve...

All,
wow... I am getting the bus ready for the maiden family camping voyage (Friday
morn. depart) to Manassas Va. battlefield, then to Manassas bug out... and I
discover the brake pedal goes, further to the floor than before the winter
hibernation.  I top off the EMPTY reservoir to discover brake fluid dripping
from the rubber bellows end of the m/c.  Peeking under the bellows reveals a
rusty, seal eating shaft under there.

So, wife is flipping, kids are still wanting to see the Karmann ghias and
herbie.... And it is Tues. night in western PA.

Can the list direct me to a source of a '68 bus master cyl. that can be at my
door by thurs. afternoon?

Thank you in advance.....
