And one more bit, we get to deduct 17.5% for VAT tax!!

Ken:  A 34-PICT4 carb at $165 still pretty good considering what new
34PICT-3 carb goes for here in the USA.  Typically $140 is the best I've
seen (the 30/31PICT are much cheaper new).  Whack another 17.5% off and I
suspect that we can ship them cheap too...

Do I see that in the UK they have German Heat Exchangers for US$165 a pair?
I thought these were NLA.

I'm in for 2 pairs if we want to do a group import purchase.  Anyone know
how we can get these in the USA for US$200 pair with shipping?
