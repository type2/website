Subject: Not a mechanical issue, but I need tunes!

Does anyone have any suggestions for wiring speakers and a CD player into my
1980 Vanagon Riviera?  I'm about to undertake this project, and I'm not sure
how to do it.  How does one run the wiring for front/back speakers?  Do I
need special harnesses, adapters etc?  Which power source should I mount?
Where have folks mounted their front speakers?  Any help appreciated thanks,
Nik
