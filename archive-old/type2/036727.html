Subject: Roof Racks and Westy rear light

I have not gotten it yet, but someone is GIVING me a roof rack. They
said it was the one that is 6 ft x 4 ft and uses the suction cups and
brackets. Does any one have a photo of one of these on their web sight
or one you could e mail me? The owner mentioned that it was missing a
few pieces so I need to compare what I will have. I also remember
several people looking for these parts, any one find a good source?

And since the bus gods have smiled on me with a freebie I would like to
offer a westy interior light to whomever needs one. The one I have has
good knobs and the lens is in ok shape. It's not perfect, like the man
says the roof rack is, but hay I don't have a roof rack so any thing is
better than nothing, so if you have a hole where a light is suppose to
be let me know and the first person to respond will receive it FREE,
I'll even pay the postage.
Please only respond if you NEED one, not just a extra one to have
around.
Meredith
