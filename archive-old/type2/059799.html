Subject: West Table ID

List Westy Sages:

I found a 13&quot;X13&quot; Westy table while looking for another stored part
the other day.  Does anyone know what this is from?  It has one (I
suspect it needs two?) 15&quot; leg that comes apart in two equal sections
with swiveling feet that appear to mount on each end.  Can anyone ID
this little gem?  Someone locally guessed it was a steering wheel table. . .
