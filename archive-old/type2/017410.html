Subject: 2.0 L nightmares

Hiya everyone,

Lemme get right to the point. I've done some pretty stupid things, like
putting bus gearing in a bug, &quot;syncing&quot; duals without the tool, using
detergent oils in an engine that had run on non for 20 years...so forth.
Some were done for fun and others were just plain mistakes, but all
goofs were learning experiences. I do fear though that I've made the
biggest goof of all in purchasing a 76 Westy with the 2.0 L FI engine.

I've been all over the archives and the library looking for info and
this has been very helpful. I've arrived at the point that the engine
finally runs ...sort of.... It used to work well for about 15 minutes
and then, when warm, would pull all kinds of hijinx including rough
idle, stalling hesitation...you get the picture. So, I followed standard
procedures, checking the coils, rotor distributor....did a valve
adjustment..all the things I'd do short of carb work since of course
there isn't one on &quot;Ellie&quot;. She now runs ...with too fast an idle and
waaaaay too rich. As per the archives and library I've done the
requisite checks as described in the troubleshooting article. All to no
avail..which leads me to what seems to be a clear picture of what's
happened to this bus in her lifetime, namely that instead of doing the
proper maintenance the PO took the easy way out and adjusted rough
running first with the idle speed screw, secondly with the throttle
linkage, and last with the mixture idle control in the air flow
meter......

The posts by you Volks and the library make it pretty clear about what
should be done in the course of regular maintenance but obviously things
have been &quot;adjusted&quot; way out of spec. Since this is my first time
working with the FI engine I do feel like I'm in a bit over my head, and
much of what I've read strongly discourages fiddling with the throttle
control linkage and all but prohibits touching the idle mixture control.
So, that's where I am...sorta lost. Might there be any advice out there
or is this a job best left to a pro?

Thanks in advance,

John
76 Westy &quot;Ellie&quot;
