Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for an engine- AVP?

Stay away from AVP. Nice folks, but somewhat shoddy work.
I have about 5,000 on my AVP right now and it sounds like a cam bearing
is loose already, the lifters knock pretty loudly on a daily basis when
gapped properly and it just doesn't feel right.

maybe it'll last 30,000 miles, but id probably be a little surprised if
it did.

CHT temps are a little high even in a colder area, so you really need to
watch when lugging up hills.

&gt; I'm looking to put either a new or rebuilt engine in my 68' (my current 
&gt; engine is fully toast).  Since I don't have many local options 
&gt; (Annapolis, MD), I've been looking around for some options.  Can anyone 
&gt; offer some thoughts on AVP?  Others I should consider?  I am fully aware 
&gt; of GEX, so that should cut down on some of the email :-)
