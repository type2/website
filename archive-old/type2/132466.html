Subject: RE: [T2] Bridgestone dueler A/T tires

&gt; -----Original Message-----
&gt; From: Karl [mailto:aufever_at_prodigy_dot_net]


&gt; Sorry dude, you oughta be a politician. In real life, you need to
&gt; read some tire sidewalls.

Karl, there is so much more information available than that printed on the
tire sidewall, the owners' manual, or the sticker posted on the door jam.
Before I made that last post, I spent several hours researching the subject.
I have again spent many hours rethinking and researching, and I've come to
the same conclusion, and with the following exceptions, stand by my original
statements.

After reviewing the comments made to my post, I did find that the
pressure/load capacity index I described was not as linear as I expected,
but it can be applied as a rule of thumb (manufacturers have load/inflation
information available). Also, I would not reduce my tire pressure below the
vehicle manufacturer's specs unless off road and/or racing (in a bus?).

&gt; I believe they are
&gt; more accurate than 99% of the fertilizer you typed. I wish I had
&gt; pics of those LT Load range D tires that were
&gt; max weight of 1311 lbs. I wouldn't put them on anything bigger
&gt; than a wheel barrel.

Looks aside, those tires would be perfectly acceptable replacements at
proper inflations, provided they accept those inflation values.

&gt; The Michelin tires I referred to were the MX. Whether they are
&gt; still available today, I don't know. But I have
&gt; a set of 4 on my 77 Westy and I have a set of 4 on my daughters
&gt; 77 Westy. Until I need to buy another set,
&gt; then I will see what's available. But I know damn well I will not
&gt; be looking to see if they are load range C
&gt; or D only and just relying on that. I am going to go by max
&gt; weight with 1540 being the minimum and having
&gt; reinforced sidewalls.

Rest assured, you have made an acceptable selection. You have chosen
reinforced sidewall tires, which will provide you with necessary lateral
strength (similar to the load range C designation of a LT tire).
Additionally, with those Michelins, you may be doing an engine overhaul
before you replace the tires ;-). These are suitable tires at the proper
inflations (I hope you know what that is), as are the Bridgestone tires
discussed previously in this thread.

Here's a reference quoted from
http://www.falkentire_dot_com/tech_tire_basics.htm

begin quoted text

Replacement tires must have a load carrying capacity equal to or greater
than the capacity of the original tires,

&gt;at their recommended pressures.&lt;

Using the wrong size tire can lead to tire failure.

The door mounted tire information placard shows the size, load index, and
recommended pressures for each axle. While it is generally recommended that
any replacement tires have the same load index as the original tires,

&gt;circumstances may allow a lower load index, but only if the replacement
tires can carry the same actual
loads as the original tires, although at different air pressures.&lt;

Such a determination requires a sophisticated analysis of the load and
inflation charts for the original and prospective replacement tires, which
should be done only by a trained tire professional. We recommend you consult
with Falken or an authorized dealer for guidance in this area.

Additionally, Load Indexes may be Standard or Reinforced. Some
Reinforced ratings will require additional air pressure to carry the same
loads as Standard ratings. Consult Falken or an authorized dealer for
specific guidance about air pressure requirements for Reinforced Load Index
tires.

IMPORTANT REMINDER: If you require different air pressures for your new
tires to carry the tire loads, you have the responsibility to ensure those
pressures are ALWAYS used.

We recommend you place an additional new tire information sticker (available
from Falken, or make your own) near your placard, with the new tire sizes
and required air pressures noted, so that any maintenance persons will know
there has been a change.

If that is not done or you do not personally check your pressures, there is
a high risk that your pressures will be set at the original requirements,
and your tires will be under inflated, which can result in tire failure and
accident.

If you can't find tires that meet or exceed ALL the values in the OEM specs,
or you want something different and can't do the calcs yourself, see a tire
specialist (not a retailer), someone who is willing to put his insurance on
the line in making a recommendation outside the OEM specs.
