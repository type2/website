Subject: Re: [T2] &quot;Westphalia&quot; stickers on eBay :-)

You know, I hate it that they spell Westfalia with an F.  I want to protest
to the German People, about this, and many other peculiarities of their
language.  It wasn't always this way, you know.  There was the Treaty of
Westphalia in 1648, spelled correctly, with a PH.  Where did things go
wrong?

Seriously, though, it does bug me and I can't explain why.  All I know is
that it ought to be ph and it isn't.  And don't tell me it's not a Greek
word, 'cause I don't care.

Regards,

Grant



&gt; Saw this on eBay; it was definately good for a chuckle (and it is
Friday)...

&gt;
&gt; Yes, the stickers really do say WESTPHALIA.  :-)
&gt; They also come with extra stickers saying HI PERFORMANCE and RACE TEAM ...
&gt; perfect for those of us who drag race our Westies.
&gt;
&gt; No, The Bus Depot won't be carrying these. :-)
