My gosh, what is it with these late 70's buses?.. they are such rust =
buckets...even out here in California, where there is supposed to be so =
little rust. Who ever said that California cars don't rust is =
half-fibbing.. maybe out in the desert, sure, but most of our population =
lives somewhere along the coast (ahem.. I guess they never heard of the =
ocean, with it's salt air and our &quot;inversion layer&quot;- fog, really )- When =
I get up in the morning and look out on the street, any cars that =
haven't been covered look as if they've been slimed. They are absolutely =
wet with dew.=20
Still, there is something about these late 70's VW buses and a color =
called &quot;Mexico tan&quot;. Every one that I have seen recently is a rusty =
mess. The rust even looks like it is coming up through the paint. Sort =
of like a big speckled dog.=20
Well, here is the real question.. I just saw one such bus the other day, =
price tag $800.. could probably be argued down. I see in it only a core =
value for the engine and transmission and also the front end and dash =
parts. The interior is pretty much stripped out and it's a rough looking =
beast. Typical rust under the windshield, not too bad really but needs =
fixin' and also one replaced and/or primered driver's door.=20
They say it 'runs good', but you know how that goes.=20
Can anyone comment as to the value of something like this, or a =
reasonable offering price? I would really only be interested in the =
engine, tranny and parts. Jan B
