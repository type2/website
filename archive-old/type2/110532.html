Subject: naming of the new bus

well, after several months &amp; a few road trips, the new-to-me 77 Riviera
is finally in my driveway.

i want to publicly thank Rob 'Hot Dog' Henley for all his help &amp;
offering of his house for crashing on overnight trips when needed.

some things that are now complete on this bus:
-exhaust leaks repaired, which required complete removal of exhaust
system and some cleaning up of the studs on the cylinder heads.
-fuel lines replaced
-repaired bulbs &amp; grounds on taillights, etc.
-new Yoko Y356Ds
-new ignition switch

i brought it home on Friday evening &amp; the family of course loved it.
spent Saturday morning cleaning it up &amp; readying for NC inspection.
when i went to get it inspected i had no idea it would have to pass
emmissions. but luckily it passed! &amp; even better it will be exempt
next year in my county.

so we took it on it's first local road trip on saturday night to the
Widespread Panic show here in Raleigh, NC.

it was there that a name was decided upon:  &quot;The Rusty Barnacle&quot;
(our kids are big SpongeBob SquarePants fans, so this is very
fitting indeed).

up next on the list of 'to-do's are:
-brake work on front end (already have parts)
-shocks
-shifter bushing kit

its looking like Natural Bus will be our next road trip!
