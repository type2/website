ok---here is a scarry idea---

My 76 Westy is for sale---I need to get $2500 out of it to help pay
for my new 79 Westy.

If I can sell at least 100 raffle tickets _at_ $25.00 each that would
cover it.

OK---Give me some input---Is this ethical/Legal---Sounds like a fun
way to sell my bus and give at least 100 of us folks a $25 chance on
getting an OK Westy???

&gt; &gt;* big raffle, grand prize: 1959 7-door panel bus (fixed up quite nicely)
&gt; 
&gt; Hey, that's my kind of raffle!  Still daydreaming from the last vanagon list
&gt; thread on listmembers pooling together and buying a VW repair business, I
&gt; say &quot;we&quot; do a yearly online bus raffle event.  To make it interesting for
&gt; the nonwinners we could have these rules:
&gt; 
&gt; --The raffle bus will be mechanically sound with the exception of one
&gt; carefully sabotaged component (e.g. a loose head stud).  The winner will get
&gt; $50 cash bonus toward gas money if they discover the sabotage during a timed
&gt; inspection before departure time.  If while they are on the road the
&gt; sabotaged piece begins to fail, only subtle hints will be allowed via the
&gt; mailing list to the broke down &quot;winner&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; --The winner will have to drive the bus home and report back via the
&gt; internet at predetermined checkpoints.  Hints regarding the location of the
&gt; sabotaged piece will be given in the form of a riddle when they reach each
&gt; checkpoint.  The farther they get without a breakdown, the less subtle the
&gt; riddles will be.
&gt; 
&gt; This gives the raffle an extra element of &quot;chance&quot; and frustration (two
&gt; painfully familiar companions to bussers).
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, it's sadistic, but I'll volunteer to do a test run of the idea..
