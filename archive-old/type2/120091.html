Subject: painting tin

&quot;&quot;None of the high-temp paints I've ever tried have
lasted more than a 
couple
weeks. Next time around I'm doing powdercoat on all
the tin.&quot;&quot;

  When I painted my tin (Krylon rattle can) I first
cooked it in a old weber BBQ then wire wheeled what
was
left off. That was a couple of years ago and it looks
fine still...

YMMV
