Hello Everyone,
I want to re-introduce myself.  I own and drive a 1981 Vanagon and have 
posted a few times about this van.  Recently the VW Gods shined upon me and 
graced me with a 1983 Vanagon that I was lucky enough to find in one peice 
at a local junk yard.  I pulled it out and have a garage that I am storing 
and working on it in for as long as it takes to get it fixed up and running. 
It needs a lot of work and attention, but once it is all fixed up, it will 
be in considerably better shape than the 81.  Please visit my website at 
www_dot_dephotog_dot_com and check out my Photo of the Day page for a story and 
Photos of my Vanagons. I am a photographer and the website is dedicated for 
my photography.  This project is going to be documented and a special 
section on my website will be dedicated just for it.  Please stop by and 
take a look at the fun and excitement that I am expeariencing with this 
project and I look forward to meeting you and getting any help and advise 
that I will be seeking in the future. Thanks for your time.

Eggz
