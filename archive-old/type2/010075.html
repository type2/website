A while ago I posted about this idea about using a digital thermometer (for
meat or candy) to monitor oil temps.....so I did it before a long haul in
my 78 Westy (never rebuilt eng with 203,500 mi)
to Litchfield BugIN- the metal tube holding the thermistor pops right out
of the plastic end if you twist its slot with a screwdriver.  I cut the 2
wires and spliced/soldered in 2 wirses of a phone wire (these have a nice
tough sheathing- I can use the other 2 for another gauge someday).  Then I
used epoxy to fasten a 12&quot; brass tube (whatever size just slides into the
oil checker tube- 3/16&quot;?) over the existing metal tube over the thermistor,
overlapping about 1.5&quot;.  I also ran the epoxy down the tube to cover the
exposed phone wires in case their plastic color coded sheaths were heat
sensitive.   At the top of the tube I had soldered on a piece of brass
plate, allowing about 1/2&quot; of tube above it.  The plate acts as a
stop/grabbing point; the 1/2&quot; extension is used to grip  the rubber/plastic
hosing I put over the phone wire where it's exposed in the engine compartment.
    The wire I ran by the spare tire well (drilled hole in the rear westy
closet floor), and ran it behind the fridge, closet, and under the mat
behind the driver seat and under the feet and then behind the dash to come
out next to the left door post.  The gauge is only about 1&quot; across and sits
niecly against the pillar and on the top of the dash (doublestick mounting
tape to hold it).   This thing lasts a year on continuously with a button
battery, but has a switch.  My temps are directly rpm(speed) dependent-
hauling at 80 down some hills in NY state, I got it up to 270 deg; typical
60-65 mph stuff was around 230 -240 deg.  This 100 degree weather here got
that latter temp up to about 250.  Is this high?  Can't have hurt, since
the stock engine is purring at 203,250 never rebuilt miles!
