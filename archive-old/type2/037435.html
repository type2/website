Maybe the voltage regulator? If so, be sure NOT to use an Autozone
aftermarket. See my last post for more info. I think the VR is tied in with
the brake warning light circuit, so that may be an indicator for VR
problems. My light kept coming on (at various times, not necessarily
related to braking), but once I got a good Bosch Voltage Regulator on
there, the light stopped coming on.

Good luck! Joe

&gt;Put it back in but the volt meter still only reads 11 or 12 and goes down
&gt;with the lights on. Also realized everytime I step on the brakes the light
&gt;comes on.  Hmmmmm any ideas?
