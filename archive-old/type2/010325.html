Subject: How is firewall seal supposed to fit '71 Westy
Message-ID: &lt;19991013035147.16353.rocketmail_at_web1001.mail.yahoo_dot_com&gt;

I'm installing a new engine in a '71 Westy and I put
in a new firewall seal. The engine fits in all but
about half an inch, with the firewall seal sandwiched
between the front plate and the firewall. Is the seal
supposed to fit above the front plate or between the
front plate and the firewall? I'm pretty sure the
reason the engine won't fit is because of the seal. 
Thanks,
