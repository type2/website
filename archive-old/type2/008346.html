Subject: Strange Case Plug
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hey everyone, here is a technical stumper:

I am building a 1600cc DP for the '71 bus. Bought
a brand new case. On the right side rear of
the case, about even with the pully hub, is a big freeze
plug (Is is still called a freeze plug on an air cooled?).
It is about an inch in diameter.

What is is for?

Even an old '60s case I have (single relief) has the
hole, but with a screw in fitting. I always figured that
there was a drilled oil passage, machined spot, etc
behind the plug, and was an access hole for machining.
But there is nothing behind it, just the webbing behind
the cam gear.

It is not important, I dont have to remove it or anything, but
I was just curious.
