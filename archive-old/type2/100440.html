Subject: problems with 68-70 directional switch

Well,  got my bus back from the shop, and after $570 spent, I came out with 
an inspected bus, with everything working. When it was in the shop, I was 
told that the directional switch was only working sometimes. My bus is a 69, 
and that particular switch is NLA.  They installed an aftermarket universal 
switch from NAPA. And let me tell you, it is the Gawdiest thing you ever 
saw. The switch was also installed on the right hand side, which I also did 
not like.  Anyway, after driving three hundred miles on a trip this weekend, 
the flasher unit for this switch has stopped working.  Just a steady light 
now when the switch is used.  I have the old one, and am wondering if it can 
somehow be rebuilt.  Even the emergency flasher switch is bypassed with this 
abomination. Should I start searching the auctions, and vintage parts 
houses?
