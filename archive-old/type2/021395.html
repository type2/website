Subject: Dealing with a finger burn (ouch!)-using ibuprofin paste....
References: &lt;5.0.2.1.1.20010625205023.00a14d60_at_cyllene.uwa_dot_edu.au&gt;

While slightly off topic, it is applicable to the people on the lists
I'm on (for musicians and VW bus owners).   I'm both a musician (oboe)
and tinker a lot with VW busses.   Tinkerers around engines can get
burns, and musicians need the use of their fingers.  I won't bore you
with the details, but I got a severe burn (blistering within seconds due
to hot surface contact)) on a finger that ran from the tip to the palm;
some other fingertips were involved.  My spouse is a pathologist for
J&amp;J, and while I was running cold water over it (hurt like hell when
taken out of water), she gave me 3 ibuprofin tablets orally and then
made a paste of ground up ibuprofin tablets and a solution of
lidocaine/benzocaine (&quot;No More Ouchies&quot; pump spray by J&amp;J).  You need a
Morter&amp;Pestle for this; any pharmacy has them.  Keep applying this to
the burn and let it sit there- one can also pack this on a gauze pad and
tape over the area.  I reapplied it with a q-tip as it dried and caked. 
In a few hours, it showed the blistering, but no redness and very little
pain; most of the discomfort was due to the blister.  Left to air dry,
the blister (not broken) receded to a more comfortable level.  I applied
more before bed.    
  Though I have a nasty blister running all the way from my palm to the
fingertip, there is no redness or inflammation at all, and no pain- 
just some resistance to bending due to the blister.  I've tried this
before with aspirin, but the ibuprofin worked much better- according to
the pathologist spouse, the anti-inflammatory/anit-prostaglandin effects
of the ibuprofin prevents the migration of white cells to the area and
stops the release of inflammation inducing substances, which actually
causes the &quot;collateral
damage&quot; of pain, swelling, redness, and even cell death.  MB  78 VW
