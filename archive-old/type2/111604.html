Subject: Ebay quote of the day...

The headline title reads &quot;NOS Camper Stool!&quot;
Open the ad and it reveals that the stool is &quot;Used,
but its the nicest one I've ever seen&quot;
HUH?!?! NOS=NEW OLD STOCK
http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=2429504555&amp;category=42606
Probably should have saved that for friday, but I
couldn't resist.
