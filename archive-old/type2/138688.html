&gt;From: Susan Hymas

&gt;we get to do bus stuff tomorrow???  Yay!!

&gt;i can't wait.. you have no idea how it excites me to help


Likes to help and enthusiastic. Man why did I get married to my wife. I 
guess that is like the first VW you buy/take on. It doesn't matter if it was 
the best deal, becuase if you are not in love then you are now. Although you 
look at other rides and wonder....I'd like to drive that, I wish my ride was 
like that, etc. Of course the grass is always greener on the other side. I 
can think of a scenario I wouldn't like. Someone just as crasy about them as 
me and having to worry about extra hands in my toolbox. ;)

Good luck Susan. When you are done I have a lot of work to learn on over 
here in NC. I even have a Westy Guest House, with Deluxe amenities. 8)
