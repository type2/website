Subject: opening rear windows? Sliding screens? 

Hi everyone
I was wondering if there are windows available that open and close somehow 
that fit in the very back. (Not hte tailgate, I have seen the safari one 
that fits there). And while were at it, Are there screens for those windows 
too. And while we are still at it, Has any one seen or made screens for the 
middle windows that can open and close, possibly sliding or something 
siminlar. I know my friends newer eurovan has a screen on it that slides 
open.

By the way, I have seen the abreviation IMHO used before on this list, What 
does it mean.

Thanks,
Enjoy your day
