Hey everyone. I just bought a 76 Westy delux and I can't make the sink
work. It looks as though it should. The fuse is fine..wiring looks
good, but the sink pump just won't turn on. I'm pretty sure it is not
the switch..it seems to be working. Any ideas?
Email me directly if you have any suggestions.

Thanks,

Greg
