Subject: RE: '80 Factory Cal Look

Can't help with the question of how many were made of what, but 80 and
81 Vanagons came in &quot;Vanagon&quot; and &quot;Vanagon L&quot; flavors.  Vanagon has
vinyl interior, painted bumpers, Cal-look window rubber.  Vanagon L has
corduroy interior, chrome bumpers, and magic window rubber trim that can
appear either chrome or grey depending on whether you look at it in 1981
or 1996.  Don't know if Westies were made only from Vanagon ~L, but it
sounds like yours certainly was.
