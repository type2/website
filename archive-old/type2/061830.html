Please; pour on the advice!!!

  '71, everything stock, recently rebuilt top-end.
  Ramona's been dormant for 6 months and counting now. Hunkering in the
carport, gathering leaves under her wheels and cobwebs in her butt, I have
neglected her for the worst reason of all; '86 Ford Bronco with heat. I know I
have sinned.
  I wanna repent though! I cannot stand seeing her in this state anymore and
my guilt and my longing to blow down the road in my baby again consumes me!
  At first her reason for not starting was that the positive cable on the
battery wasn't always making contact with the post. Fixed that. Then I
replaced the wires and plugs to try her again.
  She will crank and crank, and sometimes even turn over for a teaser of a
second (I gave her a new battery too...), but then sputter and die again. She
has about a quarter tank of gas, and I'd think that should be enough. I even
tried pouring half a shot glass straight into the mouth of the carb; crank,
burp, and nothing again.
  I have spark! What's amiss?? Muir is telling me I am down to the fuel pump
and the carb. From sitting so long, is there something else that could need
attention?
  Yesterday I acquired a cool $1000 for the soul purpose of getting 'Mona up
to speed (now *that's* a bus joke), but I WILL NOT have her towed when I KNOW
that she is so close to firing! The bread is for heat, tires, brakes and
whatever else ails her, but I could sure use some advice on the simple (I
pray) problem at hand.
  Any takers??
We thank you all in advance*
Rachel &amp; Ramona
