&gt; &gt;Is there some kind of authorized lubricant for fuel hoses? 
&gt; &gt;Other things I've contemplated: lightweight honing oil, moly 
&gt; &gt;grease, cornstarch (might turn the gas to gravy in the tank?).

Around chemistry labs, Glycerine is the lube of choice for connecting
stuff together.  Works great.

&gt; I usually just spit on it.  Not a lugie - those are too thick and
slimy.
&gt; Not very high-tech, but it's been working for me for 15 years.  And I
&gt; wouldn't be surprised to hear that Hans and Fritz were using the same
&gt; technique on the VW assembly line 40 years ago!

Hans and Fritz must have been pretty dry after the first hundred or so
cars went by!  :)
