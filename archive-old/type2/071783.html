Hiya Chris,

I just read Jamie's reply to your post concerning the dash lights.  Dead on!  
If you take it slowly it's not all that bad.  As Jamie recommended, do pull 
the gauge cluster for better access.  When I work on my dash I label each 
wire with a piece of tape (i use a number system) and make a map of what goes 
where on a sticky.  When the map is finished I stick the sticky on the 
windshield and then I'm ready to put everything back where it's supposed to 
go.  By doubling up (the numbers on the tape and doing the map) I have yet to 
screw thing up.
Oh, and by the way, a hint for your particular problem...........it sounds as 
if you have a grounding problem to me.  The cluster (speedo, clock, and 
lights gauge) are all grounded from one point on the metal housing for the 
cluster.  If that ground is not functioning all your gauge lights will be out 
BUT your heat and fresh air will be on because they are grounded by a 
different lead.  You might want to check that out.
