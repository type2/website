Subject: Re: [T2] head temperature sensor

Matt,
Just to shoot a temp related snake you should measure the resistance of Temp 
Sensor 1 ( You replaced Temp Sensor 2). Temp Sensor 1 is located at the 
input of the intake air sensor. What year is your Bus? From Feb 1976 on the 
connector air sensor has 7 pins. the resistance at room temp between pin# 6 
and pin# 27 should be around 2500 ohms. If yours is earlier model with 6 
pins measure between pin# 6 and Pin# 9.

Some recommend finding vacuum leaks by spraying WD9 or propane at a 
suspected leak and noting any increase in RPM or if they have a C0 detector 
looking for a jump in C0 in the exhaust.

&gt;Hey Chuck,
&gt;
&gt;How are you? I just finished some work on my van. No success yet. This is 
&gt;what I did today.
&gt;
&gt;I installed a new head temperature sensor. I started the van and the same 
&gt;thing occured. It ran and then died shortly after. I next checked all 
&gt;vacuum connections. Everything seemed to be fine. No cracked hoses and 
&gt;everything seems to be connected properly. To confirm this I completely 
&gt;turned in (clockwise) the hex screw on the Air Flow Measurement box as you 
&gt;suggested. I started the van and the same thing happened. Absolutely no 
&gt;change. I returned the screw to its original position (2 and one quarter 
&gt;turns out) and tried the van again. Same thing happened. All battery 
&gt;connections are clean.
&gt;
&gt;So what do you think? I don't know what to try next. Any advice?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;Matt
&gt;

&gt;Matt
&gt;I think that you have a major leak. Low level leaks would have to be 
&gt;numerous to cause such a condition on their own. I have had ground strap 
&gt;(battery to chassis) that caused all sort of weird symptoms. Just last 
&gt;month a rusty strap caused starting problems. As I wiggled it it would go 
&gt;too a few ohms. A big ugly NAPA strap fixed that problem. A poor strap from 
&gt;the tyranny to chassis can cause the clutch cable to fail I am told. Seems 
&gt;conduction through the cable causes metal migration problems.
&gt;
&gt;Its hard to work in the cold.  Hunting for vacuum leaks has been a way of 
&gt;life for me and my 77.  I have to believe leaks are problematic in the 
&gt;older FI models.
&gt;
&gt;You can adjust the Air Fuel Mix with the hex screw on top of the Air Flow 
&gt;Measurement box. Turn it clock wise until it hits bottom (count the turns). 
&gt;This is as rich a it can go. Hook up the sensor and see if it will run. 
&gt;This mixture adjust inter acts with the idle adjust screw so the idle will 
&gt;most likely be off. But if this lets it run with sensor hooked up it points 
&gt;to a vacuum leak.
&gt;
&gt;In this case go to the Type2 search engine and type Vacuum leak for a 
&gt;wealth of info.
&gt;
&gt;Good luck and let me know what you find.
&gt;Chuck

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Chuck,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Last fall I was driving and the bus just died out. It didn't sputter or 
&gt;&gt;run rough it just stop running. I pulled over took a look at the engine 
&gt;&gt;and seen nothing. It immediately started again and off I went. This 
&gt;&gt;continued happening. Not at an exact interval but consistently happening. 
&gt;&gt;It was usually around 10 or 15 minutes of driving. It was at the end of 
&gt;&gt;the year so I only drove a few times before I stored it for winter.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I just took it out of storage and started it up and voila the new problem 
&gt;&gt;has come up. It starts, runs at high rpm(around 2000), and then dies after 
&gt;&gt;a minute. Everybody has been saying battery connections, vacuum tubes, or 
&gt;&gt;head temperature sensor.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I have cleaned all battery connections but have yet to check the ground 
&gt;&gt;strap as someone mentioned. I have tested the sensor as I mentioned before 
&gt;&gt;and from what you were saying it seems to be working. I have not started 
&gt;&gt;to look for vacuum leaks but I do know that there is a big vacuum hose 
&gt;&gt;that has a loose fit. It's the one that goes to the deaccellerator valve I 
&gt;&gt;believe. It's connected but should be clamped. Would a loose fitting hose 
&gt;&gt;cause such a problem?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;It has been snowing up here for the last week so not the most pleasent 
&gt;&gt;weather to work in. Anyway I would like to get it running and tune it up 
&gt;&gt;for spring.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks alot for your help,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Matt

&gt;&gt;You are not wrong the colder the temp the higher the resistance and the 
&gt;&gt;richer the fuel/air mix. What happened to start this problem off?

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Thanks Chuck,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;I live in Ottawa, ON, Canada and it was about 0 degrees celcius yesterday 
&gt;&gt;&gt;when I did the testing. Perhaps the cold temp is responsible for the high 
&gt;&gt;&gt;resistance before start up. I always thought it was the opposite though. 
&gt;&gt;&gt;That resistance decreased as temperature increased. Am I wrong? Anyway I 
&gt;&gt;&gt;will check all the vacuum hoses and get back to you with what I find.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Matt
