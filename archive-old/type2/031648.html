&gt; I agree with Karl.  But for HC to be that High it must be a whale of 
&gt; a hole.  It's so lean that it's just bearly firing.

have gone over this thing with a fine tooth comb, there must be a leak I
am missing, somewhere some how.......BUT
. it runs fine at higher RPMS
. it is timed at 8btdc
. starts fine
. temp gauge says it is running normally, rarely over 210 lately
&gt; 
&gt; The only other time I've seen HCs this high with low CO was when I 
&gt; mis-installed the vacumn lines.  It appeared that the timing was 
&gt; correct at idle (very rough) but it really had advanced the engine 

runs reasonably well at idle, but it backfires (very small) and then
races....no pattern of any kind

&gt; &gt;&gt;  Can anyone explain to me how you can have CLEAN 0.0 CO and high DIRTY
&gt; &gt;&gt;  HC?????????
&gt; &gt;Way TOO lean, so lean it is mis-firing because there is no fuel to burn.
&gt; &gt;Look for a massive vacuum leak.
