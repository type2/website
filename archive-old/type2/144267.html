Subject: Re: [T2] How many solenoids..

I am very suprised that no one has mentioned the four solenoids that every
FI (big hint there) has!

I have to disgree with Richard (from XXXX) on relays vs. solenoids.  Both
are electromgnets, but the core on a relay is fixed and atracts a plate.
The core on a solenoid is is movable and that core is itself attracted by
the coil, actuating some other part.

OOK!
