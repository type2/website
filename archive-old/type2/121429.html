Subject: torque wrench $10.

I bought the ten dallor torque wrench at harbor freight. It appears to be a 
sturdy wrench.
I also plan to buy a torque wrench from sears;
http://www.sears_dot_com/sr/javasr/product.do?BV_UseBVCookie=Yes&amp;vertical=TOOL&amp;pid
=00944596000
It goes from 5lb to 80 lb. I plan to use it for such things as changing the 
oil.
What do you think about this sears torque wrench..
Thank You Very Much
     Sincerely,
Vincent Moreno
