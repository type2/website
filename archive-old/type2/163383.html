Subject: Re: [T2] Re: getting rid of points - Roy

Hi Roy -

Not having used a &quot;Hot Spark&quot; Ignition I cannot offer an informed opinion,
but I do agree with the many points you have addressed.  I'm hopeful that
it's a more reliable unit than what has been offered in the market place for
many years now.

And yes, points are just too &quot;old school&quot; for me as well as others.  Can't
remember the last time I used a &quot;Kettering&quot; system without upgrading to
Electronic Ignition.  I'm getting ready to upgrade my (ahem) 72 411 Wagon to
EI as soon as I get far enough along in it's restoration.

All right, that's enough &quot;guffawing&quot; out there amongst you 411/412
doubters.  Yes, I've crossed over to the &quot;dark side&quot; with VW's Edsel, but
I'm amazed with it's creature comforts when everything's running right ;-)

&gt;  Jim,

 &lt;Previous Quote Partially Snipped for List Bandwidth Brevity&gt;
&gt; Out of a couple of dozen or so Pertronix units, I saw one that failed, but
&gt; it was DOA, right out of the box. I saw several Compu-fire coils (the
&gt; &quot;distributorless&quot; variety - 4 coils on one board) fail. So far, I haven't
&gt; had a single Hot-Spark ignition fail.
&gt; I *do* think that we can agree on one thing, though: points suck. They're
&gt; the least reliable part of a vehicle (not including the driver). They go out
&gt; of adjustment within 1,500 miles or so and affect dwell and timing. Sure,
&gt; it's easy enough to readjust the points and then set the timing (yet again),
&gt; but why bother? I'd rather be driving my bus or working on something else.
