Subject: Westy wiring in engine compartment

I'm trying to finish out the electrical connections on a '79 interior
that I installed into my '72.  I have found blurry printouts of the
wiring diagram for the westy wiring, and I've resolved most of my
wiring issues by squinting at the diagram.  I have a few left, I'm
sure, but now I'm focused on the relay, battery and engine compartment
wiring bit.  Fortunately, Jamie Rivers has a nice page dedicated to
wiring the relay (http://www.globalserve_dot_net/~jrivers/aux-batt.htm),
but I can't figure out where the orange wire with a ring terminal on it
goes.

A 2 wire bundle is passed through the sparetire well into the engine
compartment.  The red wire connects to the fuse block that routes to
the + side of the 2nd battery.  So, where does the orange wire go? 
From the blurry diagram and the ring terminal, my guess would be that
it goes to ground.  The orange color instead of brown has me uncertain.

TIA,
