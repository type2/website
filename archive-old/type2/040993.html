Subject: vw canvas closed :-(

hey volks,

mebbe this is old news, but i just spoke with the folks that used to be vw
canvas (in la vernia, tx) and they are no longer in buisiness :-(  i bought
one of their awnings for my ex '71 rustfalia back in '97 and it rocked! and
only about $150 if i remember correctly. anyone know of a similar
replacement? i really don't like the rv type of roll-out awning. or the $
they cost :-(

hope to see some of you at the socal classic this weekend! my daughter,
nohemi, and i will be camping saturday night at camp pennel (sp?) if anyone
is interested.

later,

tony
