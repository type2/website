&gt;Err, you can get roller gear, at least here in the UK. _at_least 3 types.

Thanks for the reply - I think you're only talking about rockers.  I'm
talking about rockers *and* lifters.  In other words, the lifters have
wheels on the cam end which &quot;ride&quot; over the lobes.  Roller rockers are nice
but they don't do much for cam wear - the roller lifters are what saves the
cam.  Because of the wheels on the ends, the lifters must not turn in the
bores so the engineering required would be more than just a simple lifter
swap.
