Subject: 2 busses for sale!

Greetings,

We have 2 busses for sale.

1.  This is a 1977 Westfalia overnighter/hard top.  It has 181,000 miles
total and about 2,000 miles on a totally rebuild motor with fuel
injection.  This baby runs like a top.  My dad's asking $4,500 firm.

2. This is a 1978 VW transporter.  It has 167000 miles total and 12,000
miles on a rebuild motor with fuel injection.  Being up front, this
motor is cold blooded.  When cold, it fires right up, but runs a bit
rough until she warms up.  I just plain don't have the time to track the
problem down.  I just tuned it up and have new points, plugs, plug
wires, cap and condenser.  The dwell is rock solid.  This baby DOSN'T
LEAK OR USE ANY OIL!!  I'm asking $3,200 firm.

I and the busses are located in Richland, Washington.

Mark
