Subject: Swap VDO clock for tach

Hi, I don't need the clock from my 78 bus as I have one in my stereo. I
would like to install a tach in it's place. If anyone is interested in
swapping a tach for it please contact me. The works fine and keeps good
time. It is the quartz variety that was stock in a 78 champagne edition.
Bob
