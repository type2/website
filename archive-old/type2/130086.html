Subject: Re: [T2] No Power to Coil

What a great group.  Just typing my email brought about the 
solution.  There were a pair of wires that come through the firewall on the 
passenger side of the engine compartment, and had fallen behind the voltage 
regulator.  I connected one of them to the positive side of the coil and 
now I have spark!  Unfortunately, I have no compression on the two 
cylinders of the new head.

Hopefully, all that means is I did a really bad job adjusting the 
valves.  The last thing I want to have to do is drop the engine again 
because I messed up the head bolts or the push rods.

&gt;Now it's all back together (almost) and it will not start.  I am not 
&gt;getting any spark, and it looks like I am not getting any power to the 
&gt;coil.  Unfortunately, my friend disconnected most of the wires running to 
&gt;the coil/distributer, so I don't remember exactly how it looked before we 
&gt;pulled it.
