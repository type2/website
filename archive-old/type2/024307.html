Hello all,

I have a mystery box ignition that came with the bus.  No spark so I put in an old 009. Ran fine for a hundred miles (ashville where i bought her, to durham where i live) until i came to a State Patrol checkpoint. stalled and would not start. the look on the troopers face was priceless. &quot;oh, hell&quot; he said as I was in the middle of traffic. eventually got a jump start from AAA, adjusted the timing a bit, and away. . . until it got dark, and i tried to turn the lights on. engine immediately started to cut out. turned lights off. in weekend traffic on the interstate. darker, and darker. gen light brighter and brighter. (fan belt was ok when I stopped last) eventually died dead. fortunately on an exit ramp. would not push start. no power. called AAA again to take advantage of the Plus program.  Flatbed for 60 miles home at last!

so why did she die?

the high school kid DPO had the new battery in backwards. (confused perhaps by the red ground wire). that would explain why the transistor ignition did not work. so I have this small aluminum box with small cooling fins, no markings whatsoever. anybody know what this is? I want to install it for potentially better fuel economy. recommendations on potential advance curves for these thingies?

Will
