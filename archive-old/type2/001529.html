Volks,
Was up under my 73 and I noticed that the tie rods are not straight, they
have a bend in them (both of them) sorts like a bow.  Is this correct?

Also, when I drove it home after I bought it, I could tell no brake booster
action.  I am replacing the vacuum line.....is there a way I can test it
without the engine in the car? I have a mityvac vacuum pump I use for brake
work........
