Hey All!

Sorry I'm a little late getting on this thread, but things have been kind
of hectic here at work this week.  Anyway, I was one of the inital posters
discussing Propex (aka Carver) propane heaters a couple of months ago.  I've
since pretty much decided on trying to find a Eberspacher BN-4 gas model
(hint hint to anyone out there with one to sell), but I sent off to England
for info on their propane heater.  I got back some stuff straight from them,
but about a week or two later I also got another packet or maybe two from
another company here in the US, on the west coast.  (I believe it was a
Marine supply company in Seattle but I'm not positive.)  I still have the
information at home and could look up the name of the company and phone
number, etc. if anyone is interested.  This company appears to be a (or THE)
US distributor for Propex and it might be easier or cheaper to deal with
them than racking up long distance charges, plus shipping.  They seemed to
mostly be pushing the larger propane models for yachts, but also had the
model 1600 that people would want for their busses.
