Subject: RE: Part 2 of Extremely HIGH oil pressure

Be sure that your smog equipment is hooked up correctly. On my
bus, the previous owner had one hose in the wrong place, which forced
air into the crankcase. That had the effect of raising the oil
pressure and causing oil leaks. It seems obvious, but it took a while 
to figure out.

Subject: Part 2 of Extremely HIGH oil pressure


Volks- I took off the external oil cooler, filter and hoses and put on
the old filter in its spot. My oil pressure stayed around 30 as my filter
filled up and then shot up to  over 80 psi again. 
Then I crawled under the bus and pulled out the oil pressure relief
valve, wiped it off looked at it and then put it back in. I started the
bus again and my oil pressure went up to +80 psi.  I got a response from
someone stating that my oil pressure would be high while the engine was
cold, so I let the engine Idle for a few minutes. The pressure didn't
drop. I'm wondering if my oil pressure has ALWAYS been this high, but the
idiot light could have never told me that.  The same guy who told me that
cold start up pressure was high also mentioned that someone might have
switched the springs in the oil pressure control and relief valves. I
HIGHLY doubt this because I bought the bus from the original owner and he
only had it serviced at his VW dealership. I tore the engine apart and
rebuilt it, and I didn't touch these valves (much to my dismay now).  So
now I'm looking for the oil pressure control valve and according to
Bently, it's on the passenger side of the engine, and it looks like I
have to pull the engine or at least the fan housing to get to it. Can
anyone tell me if this is true?
