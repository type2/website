Subject: Re: [T2] Head problems again

Thanks for the responses.  I thought I'd elaborate.  I do not have a 
cylinder head temp gauge, though I do have a oil temp gauge with the 
temp sensor in the plate under the dipstick.  The hottest it has run is 
235-240 at 60 mph on the highway with 100 degree outside temps with a 
full load of camping gear.  This bus is properly timed (5 degrees ATDC) 
and has all the stock cooling tin, tin seals, engine to body seal 
working properly set-up thermostat etc.  I run 87 octane gas.  It 
doesn't ping under load and runs very well.  The original rebuilt heads 
I believe used TRW valves (are these considered cheap or poor quality?) 
and no. 2 exhaust valve was burned where it meets the seat.  It had an 
indentation 1/4 of the way around the valve at the sealing surface.  It 
did not have the typical pie-shaped chunk burned out of it.  The 
ORIGINAL engine dropped a valve seat at 145,000 miles.  I consider this 
to be excellent longevity and would be thrilled if I could find heads 
that would go that long without failing.  I have never had the AFM set 
using an exhaust gas analyzer.  Probably not a bad idea, but where to 
go??  Indiana has no emission testing requirements and few mechanics 
who know anything about aircooled engines.

thanks for listening
