&gt;How hard is it to pull the cables out and replace them?  My books (Muir
&gt;and Clymer) don't talk about this at all.  I have limited tools and
&gt;limited knowledge.  If your response has the phrase &quot;Take the engine out&quot;
&gt;anywhere in it, forget it. :)  If it can't be done with a screwdriver and
&gt;a socket set... well, tell me how to do it anyway, just so I'll know.

I recently did this. I bought a new ground cable and new positive cable
with terminals already installed from a local farm and hardware supply
store. The ground cable is bolted to inside of the right rear wheel well
(removable by socket!). The positive cable goes from the battery through
the firewall to the starter solenoid. It's simply a matter of disconnecting
the cable from the solenoid, pulling it out, and installing the new one. If
you can, measure the old cables before you buy the new ones. There's a
variety of lengths, and you want to get the right length. The hardest thing
is removing and threading the cable through the firewall, but the whole
process took much less than half an hour, and I'm certainly no expert.

I would recommend getting the ready-to-install cables. They were pretty
cheap. I know that when I took off my old ones, they were corroded on the
ends. Also, if you have to cut off any of the old cable to install new
terminals, the cables may not be long enough. Remember to vaseline the
battery posts before installing the terminals on the battery.

Good luck!
