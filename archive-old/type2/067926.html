&gt;The steering shaft is a hollow shaft that is inside the steering tube,
&gt;another hollow shaft (tube inside a tube). The horn ground wire connects to
&gt;a spade connector at the steering wheel, then goes down the center of the
&gt;steering shaft (inner tube). However, I cannot see where it comes at the
&gt;bottom. The only connection I see at the bottom comes from a spade
&gt;connector on the inside of the steering tube (outer tube).
&gt;
&gt;My question is, what happens to the wire between the time it enters the
&gt;inner tube and exits the outer tube? Or do I have it all wrong? I lay under
&gt;the bus all last Sunday pondering this. Help!

Steven Dolan had a through description of the horn wiring, but just to
clarify the specific answer to Jerry's question:  The wire from the center
of the steering shaft (inner tube) DOES exit at the bottom, but just by a
little.  The inner tube is connected to the steering gear box by a rubber
(or rubber-like) disk.  There are two bolts that hold the inner tube to the
disk, and two more bolts that hold the steering gear box to the rubber disk.
Because the disk is rubber, the steering gear box and inner tube are
electrically isolated from each other.  The wire in question comes out of
the center of the inner tube and goes under one of the bolts connecting the
rubber disk to the steering box.  Note that it must be one of the two bolts
connecting the disk to the box, and not one of the bolts connecting the disk
to the inner shaft.  Hope this helps some!
