  *UPDATE* - *CANCELLATION*

Hi,

While Chad, Roy and I were having lunch, Chad's cell phone rang and 
it was Todd. We chatted for a while about his problem and he seemed 
to know something about VWs. After all was said and done gave him the 
number to Transporter Werks in Raleigh, NC and advised him to get it 
towed (Todd did not have AAA) to TW and see if Sean would let him 
store it at his shop until Todd could return with a fresh motor.

We have not heard anything since that conversation which took place 
about 1:00 PM.

Thanks
Chris

&gt;I just talked to Todd. With the difficulty in reaching anyone on the 
&gt;eve of a holiday weekend he has decided to rent a U-Haul &amp; trailer.
