Jason,
  The wood you are looking for is called Baltic Birch.  You can find it at
hardwood
specialty shops and it comes in 5ft x 5ft sheets.  Someone on the list even
reported
that Home Depot was able to special order some for them.  I got mine from a
cabinet
shop here in N.C..  Check thru the yellow pages for your area.  After you
get the wood
you will have to stain and polyurethane it.  I used the MinWax Pastels #800
Winter White
that was recommended by someone here on the list.  It will be whiter than
your existing
stain but the polyurethane coating over it will tone it down a little.  If
you get enough to
do the whole headliner, then of course, there will be no difference in the
shades of the
different panels.  Hope this helps.
