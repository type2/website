Subject: Leistritz Muffler for 78 Bus

I am currently running a Leistritz muffler on my stock 74 Bus.
This was installed by P.O.
A friend of mine is looking for replacement muffler for his stock
78 Bus......there appears to be  HUGE  difference in available
replacement mufflers for the stock 78 motor......(price &amp; quality)....
The Leistritz muffler on my bus has lasted for years  and years...
so my friend was asking about where to get one...???

So before he lays down big bucks for one.......

1)   can u still buy Leistritz mufflers?
2)   are they the best you can get?

   or
3) does the list reccommened another brand????

Glen
