Subject: Pulled a stud

Hi all! Sunday while my friend and I  were installing new heads on my engine, 
we pulled a stud, one of the long ones. Now this is something I really know 
nothing about. He said I need to find an oversized stud, and self tapping if 
available I called Bus Depot..no go. I see some studs like in the RMMW 
catalog that are 8mm, and then some in the GEX catalog that are 10 mm, are 
the 10mm ones the oversized ones?
Any thoughts on this or info where I can get them is much appreciated.
