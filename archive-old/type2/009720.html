Laurin,

I have two studs with buggered up threads on my 79 Westy.  I ordered 
replacements from RMMW, but they do not fit my bus - they are long enough, 
but the thread ends 1/4&quot; before the end of the stud.  The ones I need have 
thread all the way to the end of the stud.  I spoke to the QA man at RMMW, 
who wasn't much help, although they let me return the studs.

I plan to go to a wheel specialist store to see what they've got for 
replacements.  I suppose you could replace the entire hub if they come 
complete with studs.

&gt;From now on, I make sure they don't overtighten the lugs at the tire stores 
and I make them put anti-seize on the threads to try to avoid more of the 
same problem.

Good Luck,

Ray

79 Westy &quot;Nimbin&quot;



&gt;Can someone post a &quot;how to-&quot; on removing and replacing a lug stud on a 77 
&gt;(et al) rear. I have one that was badly stripped by an impact wrench.  
&gt;Where does one find a replacement stud anyway
