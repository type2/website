Hi!

I'm new to this list.

I have a completely resto-customized '68 bus and I live at 8,600 feet 
above sea level on the Eastern Sierra. I know some of you from CCC 
Trips - would like to get to know the rest of you. 

&quot;Her Majesty&quot; has a 110V electrical system, a second deep discharge 
battery with a combiner from West Marine, a gas heater (from the 
dreaded JB's Heater Service) and a raft of other customized jive. If I 
can help anybody out with anything, let me know! In particular, I get 
along famously with Joe at JB's Heater and can give you hints on how to 
get him to work for you... which I hear can be pretty hard if you don't 
treat him right.

Anyway, Hi!

Kath and Her Majesty - the bus that makes people smile!
