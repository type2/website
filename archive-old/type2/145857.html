&gt;I am getting my 82 Westy ready for a big trip next summer and I have a few 
&gt;things that I need done.  Besides the usual brakes and auto trans service etc.  
&gt;I want to check the cylinder compression and would like an opinion on 
&gt;tolerable readings and danger readings that would warrant a rebuild.

VW's spec:

http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/FAQ/FAQContent.html#0105

&gt;My only 
&gt;complaint about the engine is at start up I have a noisy hydrolic lifter noise for 
&gt;about 7 seconds till the oil gets there.  I read about the GM Oil Additive and as 
&gt;soon as I am down 12 oz I plan on adding to see if it fixes the problem.  

Just remove the problem lifter, disassemble it, clean out all of the oil and varnish using carb cleaner, then oil, reassemble and install.
