hey karl the key slot is in the handle not the door....
the lock mech all looks good but for some reason when you push on the little white latch inside it wont lock?
moves but dont lock from inside..?
it will lock the handle with key from outside though...

Sounds like your latch is not fully latching.

The key just locks the outer handle. The inner button locks the latch assembly.
