&gt;
&gt;in looking at bus ads in the classifieds, i see a lot of them have very
&gt;recently  rebuilt, new or replaced engines. often these have less than 5000
&gt;miles on them. am i being paranoid, or is this something to be suspicious
&gt;of?
&gt;

A lot of the time it's basic math:
Have bus, blown engine....bus worth maybe $500.
Have engine rebuilt/patched.... spend $300-$800.
Have running bus worth $2000-2500
These figures vary, but a bus with a dead engine isn't worth much :)
