&gt;I'm getting dizzy just thinking about all the distributors i have piled up
&gt;that are good used functional parts but the springs have failed. Who
&gt;has a source for these parts, and what are the parameters for direct
&gt;replacement and/or updates to modified engines ? ( i.e. &quot;recurve &quot; ).
&gt;For such a relatively expensive original vw part to fail due to minor
&gt;malfunction with simple repair procedure seems such a waste.

No shit, and the real pisser is the 2.0 FI ones that the springs don't
even fail but for some reason unknown to man they added those little
plastic insulators? (no need to insulate) to the tabs the springs go
on.  When they get old and crack off, poof useless dizzy for a friggin
$0.05 plastic whichamajig.  If anyone can get those things I'd really
like to know.
