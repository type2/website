Shawn,
	If you couldn't get the pushrod out when you installed the new pump it
probably means that the end of the push rod has 'mushroomed' as it has worn.
This also means that your pushrod is worn and too short so that could very
well be the source of all your problems.  You probably (I think...) received
a new pushrod with the new pump.  You will have to install that one to get
it to work properly.
	So now your problem is getting the old pushrod out.  This is a real bugger
and I'm not sure how to do it without gobs of work.  I only had to fix this
once before and I was doing a complete overhaul at the time so the case was
split.  That sort of helped.  ;-)  I'm not sure how else to do it.  Gorilla
tactics?  This would inevitably damage the push rod bore somewhat.  It might
also leave broken off bits of your pushrod inside your case.  Neither of
which is terribly good.  Someone else might have some suggestions.

Good luck,
Clark

Ps.  Looking at the clear fuel filters is NOT a good way to tell if your
fuel pump is working.  It seems to defy nature but the filter can have very
little fuel in it an yet have a nice steady stream pumped out the other end.
Don't ask me how it works... I've just seen it happen on my own VW's this
way all the time.  Perhaps a person smarter than I can explain it!
