Subject: Re: Evaporative engine cooling

&gt; ...If you put a misting system in the air intakes for the engine 
&gt; compartment, that should result in the equivalent of a 20F drop in 
&gt; ambient temperature from the perspective of the engine's cooling system. 
&gt; And that might just be enough to keep the driver's blood pressure at 
&gt; reasonable levels while driving through the desert and monitoring the oil 
&gt; temps...
&gt; ...The trick is to optimize the system...
&gt; ...Any ideas?

Seems like the real low tech way would be to have some kind of on/off 
switch back where the action is. You flip it on before you drive away, 
turn it off when you get there.

A very slightly higher tech way would be to have some kind of on/off
switch on the dashboard. When it gets hot and your blood pressure climbs,
flip the switch and watch temp and blood pressure come back down. 

The high tech way would be to have some kind of blood pressure cuff for 
the driver. When his/her blood pressure climbs above a threshold (that 
should be adjustable, for optimizing the system), the system goes on. 
Alternatively, given the hypothesized positive correlation between blood 
pressure and oil temnperature, and negative correlation between blood 
pressure and oil pressure, an adjustable switch wired to either could 
produce good results. 

I think basing evaporative cooling system switch off the signal from the 
oil temp sender would be the most straightforward approach. Then you 
wouldn't have to recalibrate if the driver takes up a fitness program. :-)

No matter how you actuate it, seems like those people misters they sell 
in home and garden stores these days might be a useful source of water 
delivery hardware. My general experience with those on my patio is that 
they work great, but get lime deposits easily. Routine removal and 
soaking in vinegar would be a good maintenance protocol.

Your actual mileage may vary,
