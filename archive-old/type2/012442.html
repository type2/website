&gt;&gt;jacket that was lined with a white woven material, is this sucker
asbestos?   
&gt;&gt;Jeff S.
&gt;
&gt;Jeff:
&gt;
&gt;I believe it is indeed Asbestos, unless some PO found a creative way to
&gt;put some other fibrous cloth in there instead.  

Actually I always sort of suspected those were fiberglass, they don't have
the look or crumbliness of asbestos.  The joints back to bus accordion
tubes and the mats in the bottom of some original heat exchangers
definitely are asbestos, those were the parts VW took in their exchange
survey of yore.

They &quot;determined&quot; those weren't a hazzard BTW folks, believe what U may.
