Hi Pat, I couldn't find a type 4 thermostat either.  I was told my options
were to get a used one from a yard or use a type I.  I opted to use the type
I, and it works fine, so far.

If you do this, you have to do one little adaptation.  On the type 4, the
thermostat has a male threaded end which goes into a deep nut which holds
the cable end.  The type I thermo has a female threaded end, so there is
nothing to attach the deep nut to.

My solution was to take a bolt that screwed into the thermo, and weld the
deep nut to the bolt head, after threading the cable through the deep nut.
Then you can just put the bolt in the thermo, thread the cable up to the
flapper arm, and you're in business.  I stuck a coathanger down from the top
and taped the cable end to it in order to fish the cable up to the flapper
arm.

Regards,

Grant

&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;     Anyone know where I can find a type 4 air-cooled thermostat?  All of
&gt;the places I usually go to say it is NLA.  The dealer says he can get one
&gt;for me for $50 bucks.  The price on Busdepot's site said $18.95 when they
&gt;were available.  Any ideas?  Thanks.
