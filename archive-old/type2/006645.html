&gt; And in response to the reply about fixing rust under the windshield, bondo
&gt; is not waterproof so your rust problem is likely to come back worse than
&gt; before because the bondo will actually trap water and let it sit next to
the
&gt; metal.  I have found fiberglass resin to be much more long lasting.


Good point.  What I actually used was USC All-Metal, which is a mix of resin
and powder.  It came with a little tube of catalyzer and acted like epoxy.
About 15.00 for a can to do a bunch of bus windshield sills, as long as
they're not structurally unsound.
