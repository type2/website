Subject: Metwiz wannabes

Some of you might remember the two free buses in Virginia posted on this
list a couple months back.  You might also remember that the newly
brainwashed Roy Nilsen retrieved said buses (a '74 and a '75, one a
stripped out Westy, one a passenger bus with rather serious floor and
rocker rust).

The Westy is now sitting in line at Kelly Brown's place.  In the
interim, Roy scored a '76m Westy that, aside from having no engine and a
damaged nose, is remarkably complete and solid.

Bliss being ignorance, we decided to attempt a nose transplant on the
'76, using the nose off the passenger bus from Virginia.  Mind you, we
didn't have any type of plan, just a few good tools and a rare free
Saturday at Roy's warehouse ( Roy and Chris would pay for this later
:-)).

Initially, we hoped to get away with just replacing the portion of the
nose from the crease above the air intake down to the fold above the
bumper.  With that in mind, we slowly cut out pieces of the nose to
determine the nature and condition of the pieces living behind the nose
skin.  Unfortunately, we learned that the inner air intake assembly was:
1) damaged, and 2) spotwelded to the nose piece.  We decided that we
would have to replace the air intake along with the skin.  This
ultimately led to the conclusion that it would be easier to replace
everything below the windshield.  The plan now is to leave the pillars
intact and piece the donor in.  Hopefully thie route will avoid any
alighment problems.

The only puzzle now is how to deal with the inner bumper, it was also
pushed in and will have to be straighten before the donor nose goes in.

I posted some pics of our work so far:

Some of you might find these interesting, others will recoil in horror.
Keep in mind, Roy's chief intent is to cobble together a driveble bus so
he can drive to Everybus.  Last weekend we scored a running 1600 out of
a junkyard which will provide propulsion until Roy pieces together a
Type 4 engine.
