&gt; Bob.....I think I remember reading somewhere  that Pertronix likes a higher

&gt; little weaker

&gt; voltage.....

running an original Bosch coil, and it has been in there for quite a few
years...but wouldn't it have more problems at higher rpm not lower???

probably should grab a new coil anyway..
