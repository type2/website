Subject: Sanding the car

 The subject says it all. It's as exciting as watching the grass grow
but more strenuous. 

 The van is on hold right now due to financial embarrassment.
That means the parts are machined and sitting at the FLAPS waiting
for me to bail them out. 

 So I'm working on the bug.

 Last winter like to drown the poor beast. I had holes from various
attachments that had fallen off years ago. Two of the fenders just
gave up and started bleeding rust. 

 Ten years ago I quit waxing because I wanted to get it painted and
didn't want to have wax under my fresh paint.
 It never got painted.

 Does any of this sound familiar?

 So I sanded and bondo'd the fenders and primed them. Even a perfectly 
straight fender needs bondo, why is this?
 
 The fronts came out so fine I decided to do the rears, tho they didn't need
it. Oh yeah?!! 
 I was back there for two weeks. The rear clip was a disaster.
The fenders weren't quite as straight as I had thought.

 I went out and bought a &quot;long board&quot;.
 
 A long board is a sanding board with a rubber interface, about 16&quot;
long and 3&quot; wide. 41cm X 7.5cm.
 Of course you can only get sandpaper for them at the place where you
bought it. The Expensive Paint Store. Cost is $20 for the brd and $.60
for the sanding sheets.

  I had been using a Makita palm sander and a 3&quot; X 5&quot; rubber block.
 Neither of these is adequate to give the long average needed to get
a perfect feathered average surface. I had lumps.

 Mine is a hand jobby as you can tell by the price. 
They make air driven long boards but I haven't seen an electric yet.
 If I had I would own one now. 
 
 On completion of the fenders, straight and primed, I sprayed them with a
clear coat and let it go at that. They will be ruined by the 
time I finish the body. Stupid in one case but people will wave now.
 
 Did I mention this is my daily driver? Three trips to town almost every
day. Lights out, fenders hanging, no signals etc.
 Takes planning and a lenient police force. 

 I removed all the chrome strips on the car. This is mistake about #200.
There's about 35 holes to fill and sand.

 I'm using the &quot;fiberglass&quot; bondo. Has glass fibers in it for reinforcement
but still has a talc filler. Just less than the regular
bondo. It's harder, I like that. It's harder than the paint so you just keep
working till the paints all gone and you're pretty close.

 Fact: there are a lot of softer body-fillers out there that claim to 
come off easy.
 Filosophy: If it comes off easy it comes off easy and I don't want 
that. It has to taste bad too. A skull and X-bones warms my soul!

 So I have 35 holes plus to fill and I ran around and got all the parts to
my welder etc. and I'm ready. 
 
 I take another look and see that even if I weld them, I still have to 
dimple the metal there for a decent fill to get the spread feather I 
want. Try a single point feather, it's a contradiction of terms. 
 The hole is just a better mechanical fastener than a flat surface so
why do all this? Flame all you like, I'd even like some dialogue.
 
 I took the orbital sander with some coarse paper and removed all the
paint around the holes.

 I took the small ball-peen hammer and set the ball in the hole.
Then I take the untempered body hammer I have and strike the ball-
peen flat face. I've got a dimple about 1/4&quot; deep and about 1&quot; dia.
 Ream the hole with an exacto knife to get the paint out of it.

 I swab the area down with a damp rag with metal prep on it and let it
dry. Mix the bondo and put it on with the biggest spreader you can get
in there.

 What I hate about bondo is the 3-4 minute set-up time. By the time I
have it mixed good, I have about 2 minutes left.

  No matter how swiftly or brilliantly I put this stuff on, I end up
with air bubbles. Then after you've roughed it down and see these, you
get to fill again. 
 
 And you sand and sand. I pretend I'm reubens and just take off what
isn't the car. Plug your own fantasy in here. 

 I was leaning over the top of the hot car the other day and discovered why
girls wear t-shirts all the time. Painful.

 I know that Clara could have done all this in an afternoon but I've
been screwing around on this for over a month.       west
