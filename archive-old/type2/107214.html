Subject: Re: [T2] re help adjusting the hydraulic valves-BostonBob'stome

Thanks, George- but you sidesteppped the question whether an airbound
lifter can ever expand its air due to heat and cause a valve to not
close completely, as B Bob theorizes?
I would think its piston will mush down anyway and valve if anything not
open enough?  (Note his different compression readings).

 Problems occur when air finds its way into the lifter.  Since air is
 compressable, the valve won't open as far as it would otherwise. 
Another
 problem is clogging of the small oil hole, which leads either to the
 lifter not pumping up, or more rarely, to it not leaking down, causing
 burnt valves.
