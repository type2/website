Subject: Re: battery bracket?

There's a little bracket set you can get at your local FLAPS in the battery
section that screws into that same hole and catches on the lip at the
bottom of the battery. That's what I've got (it's red). I think you're
lucky that bolt hole hasn't rusted away.

&gt;I think I heard the bolt in the battery tray I had put in a year ago on my
&gt;71 westy is for some sort of strap or bracket to hold the battery, which I
&gt;don't have. My battery always slides around, making loud noises and me
&gt;nervous. Anyone know where i can get such a bracket/strap?
