Hi All,

Some time ago, I installed an oil temp sender in the sump plate of my '78 Bus.
This involved drilling a hole, welding a nut onto the inside of the plate, etc.

Everything worked fine, but now I seem to have a small oil leak that seems to
be coming from around the temp sender. I figure that I should take it out (doing
an oil change at the same time) and put a new crush washer in there. Can anyone
tell me if this is the same size crush washer as for the oil strainer nut?

Thanks much!

Mark
