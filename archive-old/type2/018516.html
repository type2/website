      But after repeated cranking, your new battery could be so drained that
it doesn't have enough juice to crank the engine *AND* create spark. That's
why you get one right at the end. Or maybe your starter is shot, and it just
draws too much current and the coil isn't getting any.


&gt; I'm having no luck getting my points out....could I heat the thing or
&gt; cool it down and try?  I tried a gallon of liquid wrench already... no
&gt; go
&gt;

          Look, you have absolutely no choice, the points have to come out.
Points don't last very long under the best of conditions --- they have to be
in good shape (smooth on both contacts, not burned, and definitely not oily
and dirty -- you've been squirting WD-40 down there?? -- they are oily) and
have a gap within a pretty precise range. If you can't get the screw loose,
you can't adjust them, and you *HAVE TO* adjust them.
        So calm down and bite the bullet. Pull the dizzy. Then you can put
it in a vise and use a screwdriver an a hammer to break it loose. Or get
another dizzy that you can get the points out. Whatever. That's the first
step, regardless of all else.
         You can't use a torch unless you take the dizzy all apart and take
out the springs first. So you have to remove the dizzy.  What's the big
deal? It's only one little bolt to loosen. Heck, the next thing you're going
to have to do is to take out the starter and take it all apart..
          Relax and enjoy it -- be grateful for the experience and the fun
of getting your fingers all greasy inside Stella's private parts.  8-)  The
more you do it, the more she'll purr.
