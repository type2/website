I have to weigh in:

The thing about the internet is not instant global communication, and it is
not e-commerce, and it is not a revolutionary new technological paradigm.
No.

The thing about the internet is that it is filled with morons and most of
them are actively trying to destroy important public resources by abuse.
You realize this once you have administrated one of the important resources
for about ten minutes. =^ )

Administrating a list like this gets you a helluva lot of work, a lot of
idiot-mail, a bit of praise, and all in all it is rewarding and very
wearing at the same time. It's hard not to get cynical and mean, the job
just pushes you that way. Steve has done the job well and he has done it
without turning into a remarkable assh*le, which is a lot more than we can
say for SOME former list admins. =^ )

Steve Dolan is generous, incredibly intelligent, and he has amazingly good
judgement. Judgement is the facility you use to keep a thing like this
going without explosion or atrophy, which is somewhat more difficult than
herding hundreds of cats. I am proud to call Steve my friend and we were
lucky to have him as a (sole) admin.

And then as if it weren't lucky enough to have Steve, he turned around and
convinced George Lyle and Sean Bartnik to co-administrate--two more men I
admire very much. The list is in good hands and we are very fortunate all
around. All this talent AND we have these really cool cars. It's just too
much. =^ )

Still Friday for a few more hours,
