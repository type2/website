&gt; Long ago I was told to never argue with an idiot...... they just bring you down to their level and then beat

&gt;
&gt; Remember when I said 'load range does not mean squat'?
&gt; Well, you people can read whatever you want into the term but in reality it is a pisspoor name for ply rating.
&gt; Folks, that's all it is: Ply Rating. It has nothing to do with how much weight it will actually carry going
&gt; down the road. Load range C is 6 ply rating. How many Load range C tires have you seen that are 6 ply??
&gt; Probably none! Just about all are 4 ply. Sorry, but if I buy a tire that is 6 ply rated, it damn sure better
&gt; have 6 plys! I have seen 2 ply tires that were rated at B or 4 ply rated. Sorry, some other sap can but those
&gt; 2 ply tires, I won't.
&gt; Here you go if you doubt me:           http://www.autosite_dot_com/library/diction/dict0110.asp

To be fair, the &quot;ply&quot; was originally a layer of cotton fibers.  A 4-ply
tire was originally four real plies of cotton fibers.  After nylon and
other stronger fibers were introduced it was found that they could do the
same job with fewer plies.  Thus the idea of &quot;ply rating&quot; was born, to
equate tires made with modern materials with the original materials.  Two
plies of nylon can do the job of four plies of cotton.

It's rather silly, though, to worry about all the ply ratings, load range,
and load index numbers when VW has a clearly stated minimum load capacityi
in pounds.  That 1540 pound figure applies to all tires, regardless of
size or construction.
