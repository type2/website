Dear list,

Thanks to all for your responses! I learned much more than I expected.
It's refreshing to have a list like this. I feel like I'm on an island,
there are so few VW folks out here in NH.
And learning something when I thought I knew it all is always nice.

Particular thanks go to Mike Dwyer.
I am preparing this bus for a gentleman artist who plans to take it across
country to California so he can paint landscapes. (A dream of his)

Aren't we all dreamers?

Ciao,

Matt
