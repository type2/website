Subject: Hey, Y'all!  Check THIS Out!

	Thrilling Thor's-day &amp; a Happy Hollow-w**nie to all...

	Obligatory Disclaimer - No r*d-n*cks were harmed during the creation
of this epistle...

	Please kindly examine the December 2002 HVWs magazine - page 80, now
available to subscribers.  Cast yer wondering orbs upon Dave Cormack's
article and photo coverage of the VW Panic (tm) show held July of this year
in Upland, CA.  Gaze in wonderment at the photo of a line of cars entering
the event!  Be delighted at the line-up of bay window buses, lead by none
other than &quot;Save The Bays!&quot; own unindicted co-conspirator &amp; HVWs Drag Day
winner Mike Visket &amp; Itch the Wonder Westy(tm), the Herbie (tm) beetle he
inadvertently backed into (no blood, no foul!), his wife Lisa in their red
'70 convertible (2nd place at the 2002 VW Classic), somebody's '73 Deluxe,
my '72 Westy Weekender (I DO NOT weigh a ton - I'm just big-boned...), and
STBs own &quot;Preacher Bill&quot; Mortimer bringing up the rear with his VERY nice
'71 panel with the Westy interior...  Woo-freakin'-hoo!

	Save a Bay! - Start a Movement!  Keep yer eyes peeled for magazine
coverage of STBs (cross fingers) at the VWTs Charity Cruise...

	STBs has cracked the door open, folks!  The &quot;VW Died Post-'67&quot;
establishment is losing ground and losing steam - I mean there's a feature
in the mag all about collecting VW key chain swag, fer cryin' out loud!  KEY
CHAIN SWAG!  It sounds like about time for another &quot;009 Dizzys Rock!&quot;
article.  Now get out there and start swarming the shows in your area with
your trusty bays!  Calling STBs Canadian cheerleader Greg Potts - time to
lead us to victory!

	Thank you for your support!  We couldn't do it without you! (Do we
need to get a life, or what?)

	Jim Hayden
