Just to let evryone know (and for the sake of the archives), the list served 
me well on answering my problem of a sudden mushy gear shift and no ability 
to find any gear (75 Bus -- new purchase, hadn't been driven in well over a 
year).

A few listers accurately diagnosed that the shift rod coupling was gone, 
which is good!, since my worst fears were not realized. Thanks to everyone 
who responded.

On a related note, reading the archives, there is a bias for rubber bushings 
in the coupling rather than the newer urethane ones.  Wondering what the 
current list wisdom is on this subject and also, if anyone has a 
recommendation for where (on-line) to buy rubber ones.  The places I've 
checked only stock urethane.  TIA.
