Subject: Cruise Control

Hi Long Distance Drivers ( with numb right feet),

I installed a cruise control in my 77 (manual) bus following Donald Gibbons 
cruise control article in the Type 2 library.

This involved the installation of a Audiovox, CCS-100 (from Pepboys) on our 
1977 VW van.  I got the courage to do the job from Donald Gibbons great 
library article.

I used the same loop constants as in the article :
Settings. PPM - 5000
Speed signal - Tach only
Sensitivity - High (low power/heavy vehicles)
Control Sw - Norm open
Tach source select - coil

I did back off on the throttle lever arm attachment point from hole 2 to 
hole 3.  The lowers the loop gain a little but on a brief test drive the 
loop seemed tight enough. The loop is too tight to control the engine RPM 
with the bus out of gear. (It pops right out as soon as I try to engage it.) 
But it operated smoothly at 55 and 65 MPH (in 4th).

I installed the servo unit inside the engine compartment with out trimming 
any of the wires (just coiled them up). So much for noisy engine compartment 
fears.

I also welded the weird washer to the lever arm to reduce slop.


My hat is off to Donald Gibbons.

Chuck Watson
