Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Interior!

Hi Andy, it has a solid roof. I'm not sure if it was a weekender, or a 
deluxe Bus, or what. It used to have the spare mounted on the front, but 
when I got the Bus, the interior was gutted and the spare tire holder had 
been removed, and the holes patched.


Thanks!

Todd

&gt; Todd,
&gt;
&gt; Tou might consider using just the front piece for a sunroof model. It
&gt; is available seperately,
&gt; What was this van originally? Camper with plywoog ceiling, or perf
&gt; vinyl throughout?
