&gt; Hi Chad
&gt; Sounds like something's acting like a check valve in the system.  If you had
&gt; the same problem with both old and new flexi lines and wheel cylinders, the
&gt; trouble's gotta be uphill from that.  I assume your left front works fine so
&gt; I'd almost betcha the trouble is between the flexi line and the 'tee' where
&gt; the front lines join (maybe at the master?).  I didn't look at your master
&gt; cylinder so I can't say...
&gt;
&gt; Maybe loosen the line at the master cylinder and give it a gentle pump to
&gt; see if a chunk o'dookie comes out.

After I got back from High Country Bus Festival, I took the ostrich approach to
the brakes, I buried my head in the sand and ignored them.  But, as Oktober Bus
is looming on the horizon, I finally ordered some brake parts and got to poking
around a little.  Dave was right about chunks o'dookie, in facts the brake
fluid drained from the master cylinder resembled something you might find at
the waste treatment plant.

After some cleaning, the master cylinder looked to be in very good shape,
smooth, shiny surface in the bore, seal cups not torn or misshapen.  However,
the cylinder doesn't apear to be original (or correct).   It has two-prong
sender switches, where the bus wiring has three connections.  Anyway, I
attempted to bench bleed the cylinder by securing it in the vice with the
sender switches and brake line fittings in place.  I was able to get clear
fluid coming out of the single (rear ?) brake line fitting, but not the twin
(front) fittings at end of the cylinder.  I cleaned the brake line fittings (
the brass piece found between the metal brake line and the cylinder) and blew
them out, so I don't think they are clogged up.

I've checked on the archives, but haven't located any detailed instructions on
bench bleeding, any suggestions?

As an aside, I called Advance Auto, they say thay can have a 1968 master
cylinder in overnight for $39 and change.  A rebuild kit is some $43.  I
suspicious that they might not be talking about the right cylinder.

TIA,

Chad
