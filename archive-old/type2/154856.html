Yup, sure enough... the lock is bad!!! There is absolutely no power going 
through the ignition wire when turned to the start position. However, if I 
take the lead directly before it goes into the lock harness (right under the 
dash) and short it with the massive orange wire under the dash, I hear the 
starter cranking.


Thanks,

Todd

&gt; Hey Todd,
&gt; Here's what I'd do.  I'd bust out your wiring diagram and pull out the 
&gt; plug that goes into the ignition switch.  Then following the diagram of 
&gt; how the ignition switch would work, hotwire the plug with some test leads 
&gt; and see if it drives the starter.  If that works, then I'd do some 
&gt; continuity tests with a multimeter to see if your ignition switch is 
&gt; working correctly.
&gt;
&gt; good luck!
&gt; Mike
