&gt;
&gt; --Duane,
&gt;
&gt; you probably missed the vote/fistfight about a year ago about having ebay
ads on the list.
&gt;
&gt; anyway, the vote was taken and people decided that everyone knows where
ebay is, and they can look themselves if they want, and the list will be for
discussion thereof.
&gt;
&gt; anyway, no big deal to me, but I've found you should check out the
charter's of different lists.
&gt;
&gt; there's some nice helpful folks here, and some computer types who tend to
nut-up about stuff like that.
&gt;
&gt; stick around!
&gt;
&gt; Billy
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Sorry already...the members here sure know the rules...four have already
chastised me.
&gt; &gt;I'm a newby and didn't know or read the rules thoroughly enough...It'll
&gt; &gt;never happen again...promise!
