Hi,

&gt;Not sure how many UK folks there are here but I have a cautionary
&gt;tale to tell regarding Just Kampers.

I am a fellow VW enthusiast and have had no bad experience with Just 
Kampers... Having ordered from them several times... Personally I think that 
paying for next day delivery is a waste of time - you can't blame JK for 
late delivery, thats the couriers job !

&gt;First off I ordered some parts for my 72 bay and they delivered the
&gt;wrong HT leads.  Secondly part of that order was wrongly delivered
&gt;after I had specifically stated to the person taking the order that I

I know it would of been good if they had told you that some parts were out 
of stock... but remember it is not as though we are buying readily availible 
parts like we do for more modern vehicles....

&gt;wanted the parts to be delivered to my work address.  I paid £25 for
&gt;delivery on Saturday and come Saturday I had put aside time to
&gt;work on the van BUT some of the delivery was missing and didn't
&gt;turn up till Tuesday so I couldn't get on with the job anyway despite
&gt;having paid well over the odds for prompt delivery.  When I
&gt;complained about the delivery being wrong and not on time I was
&gt;initially fobbed off with excuses and had to phone back a second
&gt;time to get a refund of the difference in delivery charge.

You would have been better off putting the £25 delivery charge in your 
petrol tank and collecting the goods from JK directly...

   Anyway I'm not going to moan anymore... If you don't like JK try German &amp; 
Swedish. They have a very good ordering system and everything I have ordered 
has always been delivered promptly.

Good luck !  and happy camping....
