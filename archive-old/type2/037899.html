Subject: Stupid 'freeze plugs!!'

Mine is a 1981 transporter with the 2.0l air-cooled. What a great machine
it has been since 1988. I got it with 100K on it, and have more than
matched that. I hate to say it out loud, but really quite trouble free.

The biggest problem came years ago when the plug on the back of the motor
popped out and drained the oil all over the clutch :( I'm told the plug is
a remnant from the mold when the case was created, and a necessary part of
being able to get the parts out of the mold. I was a newbie to VW's and
stupidly let the dealer fix it. $$$$$$$ (I have since repented and found a
great shop that loves my van like I do)

Last year, I had a few oil leaks so I asked my mechanic to have at it for
environmental purposes. He said the plug was lose in the back of the motor
(same one the dealer 'fixed') and so it cost a ton to have it tapped,
plugged, and sealed with permatex and duct tape! (he was kidding about the
tape..... I think) 

This week, I get a big leak from the front. Its another one of those damn
plugs coming lose, and the motor has to come out to fix it. Lots more $$$

Total outlay on the van in 12 years, outside of those friggin plugs, is
practically nothing. A ball joint, brakes, tires, and minor dinky stuff I
do myself. Those friggin plugs have cost me nearly $2000 over the years.

My inquiry to those who might know is: How the heck many of those things
are the on the 2.0l air-cooled case??  This is two so far, one of them
twice. I can't afford this :-) I can't believe that the engine itself has
over 200K miles, never been opened, is running great, burns no oil, and
passes the emissions tests, but the stupid case is falling apart.

Man, just wondering if there is another one waiting to fail. Plus, I was
recently divorced and there is no one else to rag to about this &lt;g&gt; Thanks
for listening!

Regards from Utah,

John
