Subject: Charcoal Filter Canister

List;
I have a 74 Bus with stock 1800 dual solex(s).
Both the EGR and Exhaust Afterburner Sytstems have  been
removed by P.O./mechanics.

In Canada..no emmissions tests/smog laws as you have in
California/other 49 States.

Probably not a bad idea..but it sure cleans things up
without all those extra hoses/pipes....

Question....on the left side of motor..I have one hose
remaining....goes to charcoal filter canister....

If I pull hose off and plug opening from motor..?? will this
cause any problems.??   O.K. to plug off???

Glen
