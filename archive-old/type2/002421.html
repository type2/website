Got a 68-79 Bentley?  Go to section 5, page 25. Figure 7 is called 'oil
breather', it separates liquid oil and oil vapor. The vapor gets sucked into
the intake system, the liquid drains back. See the bail the holds it down?
Follow the line down from 8. It starts to bend to the right just at the spot
where the engine # is stamped.


&gt; What's an oil separator?

&gt; &gt; On a type 4 engine, do NOT rely on the engine number stamped in the fan
&gt; &gt; housing. Go by the real number stamped in the case between the fan
housing
&gt; &gt; and the square casting that the oil seperater sits on. A little tough to
see
&gt; &gt; but better than going by a fan housing that may or may not belong to
that
&gt; &gt; engine. The housing can be swapped real easy.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; on the fan housing up and to the left of the fan on a type 4.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Where can I find the engine model and number?  I need to let someone
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know and I forgot where to tell him to look.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,
