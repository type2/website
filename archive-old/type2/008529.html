Hello Volks!

This is our first post.  Six months ago we purchased a 1970 Type II 
1600CC Kombi Camper from some English backpackers in Cairns, Australia 
and our heart was stolen - we are now dedicated VW lovers.  The Kombi is 
now our home and we have just explored the entire east coast of 
Australia with not one mechanical problem (thanks John Muir!).  We had a 
ball.

We are not exactly sure what model or name it is, but it has a half 
poptop that comes up from the middle on a 45 degree angle to the front 
and has a rear luggage compartment.  Does anyone know if this is stock?  
And what it's name is.  The plate behind the passenger seat says:
12 135 835
793
060 651 089 121 156 510
061 7321 042 2340 11

We haven't seen one like it in Australia yet.  Help!?

Steve and Stacy
Melbourne, Australia
