Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Erradic loss of power (again)

I had this problem, and went nuts looking for an electrical problem, cause I had
checked the fuel system.. over and over
After replacing the ignition switch and servicing the dist, coil, etc. etc.
etc... I put a fuel pressure gauge at the carb, and drove many miles with zero
psi,, 

Turned out that the fuel pump push rod , cam, operating arm had worn enough that
it wasn't pumping enough pressure.
I took out the gasket on the intermediate flange, and it went up to 10psi.. tooo
much!
I ended up sanding a bit off the phenolic intermediate flange and got the
pressure to 5psi 

In the end I had concluded, the engine ran fine with a full tank of fuel, and
started to cut out with about 1/2 tank, ,,, the carbs are about even with the
1/2 level,, and the engine ran like a motorcycle, the tank gravity feeds the
carbs

this was endlessly difficult to diagnose as every time I checked everything ,,
the Bus was parked in a garage,, and everything worked,,
I test drove it for over 4000 miles and finally the light bulb came on!!!

Thanks to Dave Russell, A Colorado A.I.R.S member, I was able to remedy this and
carry on 1500 miles home!  Long Trip, long story!

Others that I know had the same symptoms,, ended up finding debris in the tank
that plugged the outlet, --intermittently-- it seemed to have lots of fuel flow
every time they tested it,, but when they drove for a few miles,, it plugged
again!

Good Luck
Check everything!
