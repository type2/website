&gt;Hi all, first time posting to the list...
&gt;
&gt;I just built a 2270 and am strangely hard pressed to find a good exhaust for
&gt;it.  THis is for a 72-74 heater box setup.  Basically, I want a quiet
&gt;exhaust that flows -- and I can't believe they don't exist!  

Steve:

You probably want what's called a &quot;Super Turbo&quot; muffler.  I've had real good luck in non-VW applicatins with a brand called Dyn-O-Max.  They're actually pretty quiet, yet flow much better than stock mufflers.  I recall seeing super-turbo mufflers for VW engines for sale at Kymco's website --

They call it the &quot;Fat Boy&quot; and is made by Dyn-O-Max.  Otherwise, look in the VW magazines for the ads.
