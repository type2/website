&gt; You're better off mounting the emblem with the original bolts. Almost any
&gt; glue or tape that I can think of will require at least scuffing the paint to
&gt; get 'tooth' for the adhesive. Tapes will dry out and you'll lose the emblem
&gt; in the wind.

Here's an idea.  Untried, but I'll wager that it will work:

Get a half-dozen neodymium magnets:

Glue them to the back of the emblem with epoxy or somesuch.

You now have an emblem that you can simply stick on when you want it.
Each magnet can hold 10 pounds of force, so if you use six the emblem will
stay put!
