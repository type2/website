&gt; I have read many ways to get cylinders off of pistons and out of cases.
&gt; The only thing that bothers me is placing undue pressure on the bearings if
&gt; you are not doing a bottom end rebuild. And what about the brass bearing
&gt; that the wrist pin rides on?

I think you should always replace the bearings and rebush the rods when you
change the cylinders--personal preference. (And I was gonna replace the rods
with longer ones anyway, so I'm covered.)
