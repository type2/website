&gt; Thanks, Richard Atwell, for your web site!!

&gt;
Yea!

&gt; Hint from Heloise - Vacuum hoses.  Look at the vacuum hose picture on 
&gt; Richard's site..
&gt;
&gt; http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/VacuumHoses/VacuumHoses3.jpg
&gt;
&gt; Notice that there is just a 2&quot; segment of 3.5mm vacuum hose, and a 
&gt; plastic line goes all the ways to the other end.  This is a (1) great 
&gt; way to save some lengths of 3.5 mm vacuum hose, and (2) makes the 
&gt; longest part of the vacuum line pretty bullet proof.
&gt;  
&gt;
I find this style of vacuum line 'plumbing' throughout my '80s 
Mercedes-Benz.
Flexible rubber vacuum line at each appliance's fittings and rigid 
plastic line
for the long runs.

&gt; Now, for you junk yard scroungers, Heloise has noticed that each of 
&gt; the early VW Rabbit / Golf has at least a yard of this plastic line in 
&gt; their engine compartment.  It comes in different colors, and if you 
&gt; keep looking, different sizes.
&gt;  
&gt;
MB has color coded plastic vacuum lines which is available by the 
meter.  It's all
the same size and here are some part numbers to try at your local MB 
dealer or
independant parts supplier...

A 000 158 01 35        solid purple w/ black stripe vacuum line plastic
A 000 158 14 35        clear vacuum line plastic
A 000 158 88 35        clear w/brown stripe vacuum line plastic
A 000 158 89 35        clear w/ red stripe vacuum line plastic
A 000 158 90 35        clear w/ yellow stripe vacuum line plastic
A 000 158 91 35        clear w/light blue stripe vacuum line plastic
A 000 158 93 35        clear w/black stripe vacuum line plastic
A 000 158 96 35        solid purple w/ brown stripe vacuum line plastic
A 000 158 98 35        solid purple w/ yellow stripe vacuum line plastic
A 000 158 99 35        solid purple w/ blue stripe vacuum line plastic

&gt; &quot;OK, dear Heloise, SO WHAT&quot; you ask?!?!
&gt;
&gt; These hanks of tubing in the VW Rabbit / Golf are often connected to 
&gt; the vacuum nipple with a rubber &quot;L&quot; connector.  These rubber &quot;L&quot; 
&gt; connectors are optimum for some vacuum nipples on the type 2.
&gt;
&gt; For example, the throttle vacuum nipple, which is pointed FRONT (FIF) 
&gt; towards the firewall is a perfect spot to use a rubber &quot;L&quot; connector, 
&gt; and then a hank of plastic line to its final destination, to be 
&gt; connected at the final destination with another &quot;L&quot; or with 2&quot; of 3.5 
&gt; mm vacuum line.  ...
&gt;
To join several hard vacuum lines in my MB cars, I find two styles of 
moulded
rubber connectors.  Three-way connectors (Y-shaped) and four-way connectors
(X-shaped).  Here are some more MB part numbers...
X-shaped: A 117 078 00 45
Y-shaped: A 117 078 01 45

For you junkyard scroungers, on any '80s vintage MB you'll find a bundle 
of vacuum
lines which pass through the firewall, just to the right of the brake 
booster can.
