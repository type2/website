Subject: '77 Camper FOR SALE

Greetings Fellow VW Enthusiasts!

I'm looking to find a good home for a '77 High Roof.  I've posted it on a
few sites, but not much of a response.

I, along with the bus are located in east Tennessee.

Here are the details.


'77 VW Camper. It is commonly referred to as a High Roof. It is called an
Adventurewagen. Instead of a pop-top, it has a fixed fiberglass top that
runs the full length of the Bus. It has a stove, refrigerator, sink
w/pressurized water tank and water filtration system, propane heater, waste
water storage tank underneath. It sleeps 4. It has Air Conditioning, but the
compressor is missing. It has lots of room in it. Engine runs. It is
drivable, but needs work. It has some minor surface rust here and there. It
has a hole in the left rear corner, and in the left front step. Both are
small. I'm asking $1500.00. It is a unique camper.
