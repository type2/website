Subject: Re: [T2] re Pitman arm puller and drag link boot

&gt; I managed to rip the boot on my drag link while trying unsuccessfully to get

&gt; Does anyone sell just the boot for the drag link? There's no reason to assume
&gt; the link is bad, and I will grease it up nicely. Is the boot replaceable if
&gt; the link is pulled out?
&gt; Does anyone have a tie rod end/pitman arm end puller for sale for a reasonable
&gt; price? These puppies are expensive.

I bought a Tie Rod puller from AutoZone when I replaced my tie rods.
Instead of pulling the rods, the thing just bent and warped. I ended
up using a ball joint fork and a 5 lb sledge. Not kidding.

Luckily I was replacing so didn't need to save the things. 

BTW: Autozone did refund my money when I took the useless tie rod puller back.
