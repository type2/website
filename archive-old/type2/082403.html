Subject: RE: [T2] new VW ad.

&gt; ok  been waiting for Fri.
&gt;=20
&gt; anyone else seen the new VW commercial. it features a beetle,=20
&gt; splittie,
&gt; Pasat, NB,  and shows &quot;Something&quot; coming down the road. =20

I assumed it was the &quot;concept&quot; Microbus they unveiled last year at=20
one of those auto shows.  Pretty neat little ride but the front end
is pretty ugly, need to re-style the headlights (maybe even the entire
front end.)  My wife has already started saving.  She won't be seen=20
in a mini-van, but want's something to move the kids around (not=20
inclined to plunk down $30K+  on a gas-guzzlin' SUV-mini-tank.)  So I'd=20
better get her 79 running top-notch before they come out with that new=20
bus else I'll find myself saddled with another car payment.
