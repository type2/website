Bentley lists the small one as M8, torqued to 18ft-lb and the larger ones
as M10 torqued to 29 foot pounds.

I note that Mexican engines come with steel inserts in these holes.
Having experienced thread pullout on original German cases, it might be a
good idea to put the inserts in from the get-go.
