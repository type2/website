I know you've been doing a lot of work on this and haven't followed the
thread completely, but... I have a 'noid' light that you put in the injector
boot to test whether or not you're getting power to that portion of the
circuit, and it actually is really NOT all that dim. It does pulse quickly
several times with each 'firing signal'. I got the noid light at a FLAPS,
real cheap too. Since all injectors seem to be affected, have you checked
for good grounding at all ground locations for the FI harness? Have you
thoroughly checked and cleaned the connector for the resistor block and
tested the resistance (6.9 ohms I think)? It seems obvious that whatever it
is has a common affect on all the injectors. since they all fire at once it
would seem logical that the common lead to the resistor block, or that
grounding is a problem, IF you have already checked the fuel rail out. Just
out of curiosity is it possible that when you changed the fuel filter a
bunch of crap went through the system and blocked all the injectors??? I
have tested the solenoid action in a single injector with a 9v battery just
to see if I could get air through it... just a thought. Lots of rambling,
hope this helps!!!

&gt;&lt; Remove the 2 10mm nuts holding down the 3 + 4 injectors. Lift
&gt;them up and
&gt; out of the intake. Leave all the hoses attached! Have someone crank the
&gt; engine. While it's cranking put your hand under each nozzle. Is
&gt;it getting
&gt; soaked with fuel? The nozzles should be spraying. If not, let me know.
