Subject: ADMIN -- Virus Warning

Hello all,
Just an admin note:  As stated in the list charter, under no circumstances
are virus warnings ever to be posted to the list.  This is one of the big DO
NOT EVERs of the list.

As a technical note, the way we have the list software set up makes it
extremely unlikely for a virus to get through to the list.  The list
software rejects e-mail with attachments and returns them to the sender
rather than letting them onto the list.  If you get a virus it's a pretty
sure thing that you didn't get it from Type2, nor are your infected e-mails
getting through to Type2.

Bus content only, I seem to have to say it a lot even though it is a very
simple concept.

Thanks
