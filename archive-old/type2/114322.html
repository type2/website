&gt;I want to put the front kick panels back in my 76 Westy; however, they are in
&gt;sad shape. I am going to use the old ones as a template, but I'm unsure of
&gt;what material I should use as the &quot;board&quot;?The original is that hard cardboard
&gt;stuff. I can't find anything like that. What about thin plywood like luan
&gt;(sp)?

You don't want to use a backing that will absorb moisture/water like the old ones did...

&gt;I have some black vinyl too, but I'm not sure what kind of adhesive to use. I
&gt;have some 3M spray that I think will work well- anything better? I seem to
&gt;remember doing my Triumph Spitfire's with hot glue. I think you could see the
&gt;glue line though- too long -that was 10 yrs ago.

I think the best choice is to avoid the vinyl covering completely...I bought these abs plastic ones from BD (via JK) a long time ago. The pattern is so simply you could make them easily if you have an appropriate cutting tool.
