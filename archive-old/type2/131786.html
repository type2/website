Subject: Westy Weight

Hi Folks,

I wanted to weigh in on this one as well (so to speak).  The last time I was 
at my local dump they made me drive onto the scale and pay a dump fee for my 
junk.  As I was paying I noticed that the digital readout next to the window 
said 3625.  This was with my Westy loaded with me, 2 mattresses, and some 
music gear.  Doing some rough subtraction, I'd guess that my Westy weighs 
close to 3300 pounds.  That's a pretty heavy vehicle for a 75hp engine to 
push around!

Maybe one of these days I'll stop at a truck stop (or my local military 
base) and get on the big-rig scales for a more exact reading.  Still, it's 
nice to know roughly how much weight you're trying to stop when you're 
carrying a load of 2x4s and some dumbass pulls out in front of you!
