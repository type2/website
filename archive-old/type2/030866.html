&gt; This has just reminded me, someone wrote in the latest issue of 'Transporter

&gt; region of half price here on a lot of genuine VW items.  I don't know if
&gt; this applies to the whole world or not, so don't get too excited, but it's
&gt; got to be worth a call to your local dealer to check.

HA HA HA surely you jest!

recently quoted $300 for a bowden cable!
over $3,000 for late model rebuilt tranny!
