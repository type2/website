&gt; Your very wrong here Ron.  If you knew anything about this type
&gt; of tent, you would know that they all attach the same way.  I've seen just
about every
&gt; tent from every manufacturer and they all use the rod through the
&gt; pocket, and clamp to the raingutter.  You may be referring to attachment
to a
&gt; EuroVan or other vehicle without a raingutter.


Perhaps.  I was basing that assumption on the way your website read.  I
found the description on how it attached to be a bit vague and confusing,
but it seemed to me to imply that a brace or rail was required.  You may
want to clarify that description a bit on the site, as it would probably
increase your sales. (It was not clear to me, and I probably know more about
side tents than the average bus owner, having owned several different ones.)
Regardless, based on the picture on your site, the tent I have does not
appear identical to yours, although it is similar.  It is not an Andria, nor
is it from Reimo.

I don't claim to be a tent specialist, and I don't plan on going into the
side tent business other than this single offering (and a future awning
offering, which will be of our own design). I'm more than content to stick
to a single base model and leave the side tent specialty business to you.
However, I have owned five different German side tents for busses and
Vanagons over the years, and currently own two for my Vanagon (which I use
quite frequently).  Based on that &quot;in the field&quot; experience, this one
impressed me in terms of its quality, ease of use, and value compared to the
others I've seen (and owned).  I can't comment specifically on mine relative
to yours, nor can you, since neither of us has seen the other's.  But I'd be
willing to bet that both are good, high quality options for a reasonable
price. Speaking as someone who really enjoys the use of my tent when
camping, I think that many bus owners would get a great deal of enjoyment
out of a tent, regardless of whose they bought.
