Subject: In Which Changeable Tire Names Lead to Difficulty

Last time I purchased tires the information in the Library was very useful,
and I bought a great set of Bridgestones I have been very happy with.

This time I started with the Library again, but all the tire names seem to
have changed in the two years since I last bought tires.

Has anyone bought tires recently, and can you tell me what brand and what
model name you bought?

I have been looking for Michelin MXT, Bridgestone RD-603, and several others
mentioned in the library or the archives, but the company websites say they
are now discontinued.

What &quot;C&quot; rate tires have people been able to find recently?

Thanks in advance for your help.
