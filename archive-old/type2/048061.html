&gt; &gt; I plan on changing from reg oil to synthetic(Any thoughts?) 
&gt; 
&gt; Synthetic oil costs much more and lasts much longer than regular oil. But 
&gt; unfortunately with a VW Type 1 engine you will never experience the benefit 
&gt; of the long lasting oil because you will still be changing the oil at 3000 
&gt; miles. In our engines the oil is not changed because it is worn out but 
&gt; because it is dirty and a synthetic oil will get dirty just as quick as a 
&gt; regular oil.

I run 5W-50 synthetic and change the oil at 5k (after break in), I have a
2liter which has an oil filter, this keeps the oil much cleaner.

advantages are that it is much easier to start in cold weather, I ski.
also there is far less where on bearings and moving parts, synthetic
really does lube better

.  make sure your engine doesn't leak, as mentioned syn is more $$$
.  it seems to have no effect on cooling, if you run hot you will still
run hot, in tests there was little or no effect on oil temp

&gt; &gt;  somewhere that my doghouse oil cooler (1971 westy) must be replaced.  Is
&gt; &gt;  this so? I guess it makes sense.  

nah
