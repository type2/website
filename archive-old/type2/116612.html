Subject: towing

&gt;Here's the problem with that theory--

Here's the problem with not reading correctly:

&gt;Your asking a shock absorber to do the work of the &gt;suspension unit, which is not only unsafe, it's not &gt;the long term solution.

NO, he's not. He said that when he put his gas adjusts on, it raised the bus 1/2&quot;. He didn't say he re-engineered the suspension to be carried by the shocks. He changed a part and made an observation.

&gt;When the shock or the load leveller spring starts &gt;fagging out---your right back a square one.

Fine, but that's not what was intended by replacing his shocks, merely an unexpected outcome.

&gt;A load leveller devise was intended to supplement &gt;the factory suspension unit--not be the main carrier &gt;of the load.

The above paragraph is then repeated 4 times in case we missed anything.

People, read the posts for content and context before calling somebody on their sh*t, m'kay?  David Schwarze didn't join the bus community yesterday.
