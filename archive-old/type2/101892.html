Press release
January 21, 2003
Rocky Mountain Motorworks, the world's leading supplier of parts and
accessories for Volkswagens resolved their long time trademark dispute with
Volkswagen of America. Through a secondary party, Volkswagen has filed
thousands of complaints around the USA against shops and distributors of
parts for Volkswagens for use of their trademarks. VW recently agreed to
resolve the issue within Motorworks' insurance liability policy thus
relieving Motorworks of any direct monetary damages.
