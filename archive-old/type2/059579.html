Subject: Distributor drive shaft position

Help me out here volks.

'79 FI 2.0L westy, bone stock.  Just got the fresh AVP rebuild running
after the oil cooler fiasco.  Can't get enough advance out of the
distributor.  When I rotate the distributor for advance, the vacuum advance
hits up against the cold start valve.  Apparently, the good folks at AVP
installed the distributor drive shaft in a different position than it
originally was.  What are my options here?  Can the drive shaft be
repositioned a tooth?  How hard is this to do in the car.  How do you get
the shaft out?  How do you keep from loosing the spacer washers in the
case?

BTW, couldn't find anything definitive in the archives...could be operator
error.
