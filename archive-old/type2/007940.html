&gt;My bus is a '79   I had it from '90 to '93, sold it, and bought it back in

&gt;it with a '73 (1.7) engine with an old weber progressive carb.  Ran crappy.
&gt; I figured I would eventually find another 2 liter and some FI parts, but
&gt;in the meantime, I got the carb rebuilt this summer and...
&gt;	Now it runs just like new.  Great power, good reaction (no apparent lag
&gt;between hitting the gas and it moving), starts on the first crank in below
&gt;freezing weather (we had just a little of that in the Akron area so far
&gt;this year), and no icing problems.  And it idles beautifully.  I think I'll
&gt;forget the 2.0L FI engine.  This setup gets the job done just fine.  

Oh, come on Phil - you must be mistaken about how good your bus is running
because &quot;everyone&quot; knows how bad Weber progressives are!  :-)

Just kidding, from another Weber progressive fan.
