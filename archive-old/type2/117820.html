Subject: Re: [T2] Window molding insert

Richard,

The real &quot;chrome&quot; is available at Wolfsburg West.  All of my &quot;real&quot; chrome 
and window seals came from there for my 78 Champagne Edition.

Once it is installed, I don't consider it easily damaged as it is 
supported very well by the rubber seal.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I bought new plastic moulding ~2 years ago. Not sure of the manufacturer
&gt; though.
&gt; To the best of my knowledge all window rubber moulding for Bay bus's (both
&gt; original and replacement) is plastic with aluminium foil inside for the
&gt; 'chrome' effect.
&gt; All old Beetles and Bus's had the moulding as aluminium only. Easily damaged
&gt; and I don't think available anymore (never chased it though)
