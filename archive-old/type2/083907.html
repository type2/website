Subject: Re: [T2] stainless steel muffler

Hi Timo

Take a look at the Just Kampers website (www.justkampers.co_dot_uk) as they do SS exhausts for both sorts of '78 engines (1600 Type 1 or 2000 Type 4).
Shouldn't be any sales tax or import duty problems as you're in the EU.

Good luck

&gt;  subject: Re: [T2] stainless steel muffler
&gt; 
&gt; Hello everybody,
&gt; 
&gt; because I'm rebuilding the engine of my 78 Westy I'm thinking of replacing the standard muffler with a stainless steel one. Does anyone know where to get one and how much such a muffler is?
&gt; I also thought about building one by myself. Has anyone done this before?
&gt; 
&gt; Any help would be greatly appreciated,
&gt; 
&gt; Timo
