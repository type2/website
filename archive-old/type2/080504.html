not sure if you have found the answer yet

&gt; Fi Guru's,
&gt; 78 2 liter stock
&gt; Well, replacing my fuel filter(s) didn't do the job..  :-(
&gt; 
&gt; Went for a test drive between flash floods on Saturday and made it about
&gt; 3.5 miles(at 50mph).  Went back 6 hrs later and drove it back home.
&gt; 
&gt; Is it possible for any of these to be heat sensitive?

any thing can be heat sensitive. but not likely

I one time some years ago had a similar problem it drove me nuts for a
long time, it finally turned out to be a pinhole in the vacumm side of the
fuel line, as it gets warmer it got soft and started sucking air and
stalled out, later it gets cool and doesn't leak.

another thing that was not heat sensitive but might have some
affect. there are a lot of plugs and connectors, one of them looked fine
on the outside, but one of the contacts came loose and was pushed back
into the plug and wasn't making good contact.

Good luck
Bob


&gt; 
&gt; Double relay
&gt; Fuel pump
&gt; AFM
&gt; Anything electrical in the fuse area?(where heat is coming out).
&gt; 
&gt; I have done nothing except make the heater work(vacuumed seat padding
&gt; out of the main tube to the front) since I drove it over 25 miles at
&gt; speeds up to 75 miles/hour....and stop and go traffic.
&gt; 
&gt; Since it seems to take a long time idling(45 minutes or more) for the
&gt; problem to happen, I am thinking that something in the fuse box is heat
&gt; sensitive? I have tested each time with the heat &quot;on&quot; full blast.
&gt; The only thing I can think of now is to preheat some of the items with a
&gt; hair dryer and then see how long it takes to fail.  The AFM is
&gt; &quot;never&quot; hot, cause it has nice cool air running thru it.  The fuel pump
&gt; doesn't feel hot at all.  Haven't felt of the double relay when failed.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It starts and runs fine otherwise.  I will try to get it to the
&gt; &quot;fail&quot; point in the driveway again, and then check the afm and make sure
&gt; the fuel pump still has power to it.
&gt; 
&gt; When testing previously, and having it fail...I could just watch the fuel
&gt; pressure start dropping from 32psi to when it dies(about 25psi).  
&gt; 
&gt; The fuel pump seems a little noisier than before and I swear I can hear it
&gt; running now, when I couldn't before.  Has anyone ever seen a fuel pump be
&gt; sensitive to &quot;consumption&quot;.  It is like it will pump x amount of fuel and
&gt; then quit.  I really would like to replace the &quot;correct&quot; part since all
&gt; are expensive&lt;grin&gt;.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers ,dave
