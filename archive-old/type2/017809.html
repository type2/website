reality check, folks...

don't check for gasoline leaks with a lit cigarette.
don't check for propane/natural gas leaks with a match.

gasoline leaks should be visible to the naked eye.
propane/natural gas leaks can be found by using soapy water... it
bubbles at the leak and has the beneficial side effect of not killing
you. it's the gas company's idea, and a good one.

If you feel the need to grease your brakes upon hearing that
metal-to-metal scrapy rumbly sound, don't... periodic checks of your
pads/shoes (and other essential systems) should have already alerted you
to the thin linings. Park it immediately and fix it (or have it fixed)
professionally &amp; properly. 

natural selection, anyone?
