Subject: Type 2 Terms and Definitions

I know it's not Friday but it is Christmas. Be of good cheer all.  During
this season great things happen.

Carabus=  When two or more busses are gathered together to move from one
point to another.

Buscussions=  Discussions surrounding any VW bus and/or it's technical
operations.  (Thanks Mike)

Buscussing= The singular expression of verbality, harsh or frustrative,
toward ones type 2.  (Never mind the dang thing is in-animate.) 2.  What
people in Camaro's do while behind a bus on a two lane no pass road.

Busbust=  1.  When two or more cops and a dog are gathered around a bus.
2. The front clip of a bus. 

Busbitching= What many of my buddies wives apparently enjoy.  

Busbashing=  What folks who drive Ford, Chevies, and GMC Pickups like to
do.  Plainly out of ignorance and lack of positive karma of course.

Busbartering=  Haggling with the guy at the swap meet that discovered his
grandaddy had left 14 late models to rust in the back lot of his mostly GM
Junkyard.  (He is also the fella that thinks because the new Bug has been
released the parts are all worth 30 times what they originally sold for.)

Busbrat=  Those silver spoon punks that have parents that buy them all the
busses they want at whatever price so they can load the damn things on a
trailor, drag them to the show, and say to all us poor bloats &quot;Hey, look at
my new barndoor!&quot;  

Busbraut=  Gotta be Johnsonville!

Busbabe=  The fine woman helping you cruise on down the road in style, good
looks, pleasure, and relaxation.  Damn if she can't cook too.

Busbutt=  Some hoodlum club in Missouri. From what I hear they are all
elite bastards.  : )

Busbug=  Any ailment requiring 7 to 10 days of tracking, testing, breaking
down, and drinking a lot beer.

They need not begin with or even involve the word &quot;bus&quot;.  I just got on a
kick and couldn't stop.  I know, some of them are just plain stupid.

Any others would be greatly appreciated.
