&gt; The ATF is coming from a disk on the filler tube side of the tranny.
&gt; It's about an inch or so above the pan gasket and it looks like it can

&gt; bottom and side of the case.). There is no mention of this part in my
&gt; manual, so I want to make sure it is safe to take this disk out and
&gt; seal it. I don't want the entire inside of my transmission to pop out
&gt; like a jack-in-the-box if I remove this. I also don't know if there is
&gt; a gasket that can be replaced in there or if I can just use RTV or if
&gt; it just needs to be cleaned and popped back in.

that would make it an 010 tranny (1975-1979) that is the second gear
brake piston cover..
  there are not one but two seals on the outside of the seal and two more
on the inner side...  I would not pull this out until, unless you have
these seals. you are likely not get it back together.
   Bentley only shows the 003 transmission which does not have that cover.
there are two pretty significant springs in there...I am not sure I would
remove this if you still want to shift.  there is a &quot;C&quot; clip hopefully
holding it together, but....

  are you sure that is where it is coming from, I've never seen that cover
leak.  more common leak site is the torque convertor seal
