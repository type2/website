Subject: emissions repairs in VA
Message-ID: &lt;d4451ca4.246acfea_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Well, I guess 3 strikes and I'm out.  I've been to the emissions station 3 
times and keep failing on CO.  The limit here in VA is 4.0ppm, I started out 
around 7, and I've gotten down to about 4.5 on idle, and 6 _at_2500 rpm.  I've 
gone through the procedures in the archives, the Type2 library and the books 
and I'm all out of ideas.  Either I'm missing something or the emissions 
testing machine is broken.  I guess it's time to take it to the pros, can 
anyone reccomend a decent VW shop in the Northern Virginia area that can do 
emissions.  I'd rather take it to someone who knows about these things, 
rather than the gas station that did the tests.
I've been trying to do all the work on this thing myself, and after owning it 
for a year and a half I haven't had to take it anywhere so I don't know where 
to go.  This time I'm all run out of ideas and patience and I just want to 
get back to driving it.

Thanks,
