&gt; &gt;&quot;&gt; A leak down test is much more informative than a compression test.
&gt; &gt;The device costs around $50, and you must have some source of compressed
&gt; &gt;air--though high volumes are not required.
&gt; 
&gt; Then it was asked:
&gt; 
&gt; For those times when we need just a little bit of compressed air, like 
&gt; above, could a 20lb barbeque propane tank be fitted and used as a source??  
&gt; How much pressure would the propane tank be able to take?

I have an old freon 40lb tank (gotten when that stuff was $4 lb) 
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions on just what fittings would be needed.

at one time they made a kit to convert the tanks, I have it and it has a
safety valve and guage and everything, was about $20 or so back in the
last century
   I think the safety valve is set at 150psi, I know I have put 125PSI in
it years ago but now don't put anymore than about 50-60psi in it
