Subject: Re: [T2] a few more questions

&gt; As far as grade, that 30-wt non-synthetic is fine. Following some
&gt; suggestions on this list, I have switched from Castrol to Shell Rotella T,
&gt; which is working great, thanks guys. Two caveats: it's not sold in every
&gt; store--Wal-Mart doesn't have it--and it's not sold in quarts. It's
intended
&gt; for large diesels that hold 11 to 13 gallons of oil, so it comes in gallon
&gt; jugs.

When I had my Mercedes diesel I used Rotella T and Wal-Mart was about the
only place I could find it!  Guess availability depends on location :-)

Comes in gallon jugs which is about half a quart more than you need for a
Bus (Type 4), but the Wal-Mart I bought it at also had it in quart bottles.
This was in northern Virginia.

For every oil change in my Mercedes I had to buy 2 gallon jugs because it
really did take 8 quarts.

I've started using Mobil 1 15W-40 synthetic in my Bus now, good stuff.  Will
switch the Passat over to that (different viscosity of course) as well on
the next oil change, now that it's broken in.

Trivia:  Did you know that the '79 Bus owner's manual calls for oil changes
every 7500 miles and only changing the filter every 15,000 miles?
