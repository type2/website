Subject: ACVW in Milwaukee, WI?

I'll be travelling to Milwaukee, WI next Wednesday. I'll be there for a
couple of weeks. Any listee's familiar with the area? Any events or
shops to feed the ACVW jones?

Bus content:
While messing around with the cooling air flaps (checking for binding
in the movement), I think the LH one fell off the connecting rod on the
top of the oil cooler. Is there and easy way to fish it out? Looks like
I'll be pulling the fan housing again when I get back from Milwaukee.
Maybe I'll paint the housing this time so it doesn't seem like a
complete waste of time.
