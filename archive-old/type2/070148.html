Subject: Tool storage locations

&gt;&gt;option on the '71's. I'm a little jealous, but not much. My fridge is in
&gt;&gt;the garage and a toolbox sits in it's place. MUCH more use for the tools.

&gt;views are the same as yours:  a little jealous but not much.  (MY toolbox is
&gt;under the rear-facing seat.  :-) )

While we're sharing our tool locations--after keeping mine under the rear
facing seat for a few years and then under the rear forward facing seat, I
finally resolved on keeping them in the rear cabinet you access after
opening the rear hatch (this is on a '71 Westy).  I've found that by
choosing space-efficient containers and organizing meticulously I can carry
all the tools I need there (except the floor jack which I keep in the spare
tire well).   The advantage I've found to this is that all the tools are
right above the engine (no opening the sliding door for access).  Also it's
convenient when working on other people's cars--just back up to the car and
spread your workshop out above your engine!  

A further description for those interested in my maniacal attempt to
organize myself: I have two rectangular steel boxes approx. 16&quot;x7&quot;x3&quot; (one
for assorted wrenches, the other for screwdrivers/pliers/other tools) and a
half dozen labeled long plastic jars divided into catagories: sockets,
sealers, gauges, allen wrenches, adapters, etc.  Hammers and long wrenches
and a mini-cheater bar lie loose as well as jumper cables and spare oil;
timing equipment is on the upper shelf with various spares--but everything
fits neatly in that cabinet. I've found that with this method it's easy to
find things in the dark and with the proper sized containers everything
fits!  Oh, I also keep a cardboard liner in there so that none of the inner
westy wood or paint gets messed up.  Keeping it this organized forces me to
clean up tools and containers as I'm putting things away so I'm ready for
the next battle.
