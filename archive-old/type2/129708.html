Subject: 77 front window removal

Howdy. Same '77 bus...front driver's window won't roll down - crank handle
just spins. Bentley and every other manual I can find tells you how to
remove the window AFTER it's down...seems to be a problem here. The
bentley does also mention that you can just replace the cable instead of
the whole assembly. Any tips? The glass is in perfect shape, so I don't
want to force anything, but I can't seem to get it to move. Thanks,
