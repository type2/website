Hiya Seth,

As a last resort on all my parts cleaning problems I use spray on brake 
cleaner.  It has yet to fail me on anything.  This stuff is very powerful and 
VERY toxic.  Take all precautions should you decide to go this route.  Were 
it me, I'd put the clear glass lenses (sans any of their seals of course) 
into a tuna can or some other suitable can and spray with brake cleaner till 
completely wet and soaked.  Let it sit for a bit and then brush with a 
toothbrush (wear rubber gloves for this part).  That ought to do it.
