To all of you who responded about my question on how to determine wheither
or not you have hydraulic lifters...thanks!!!  The winning answer in my
opinion goes to Karl von Salzen who said...

Best way I have found: get a MiniMag flashlight. Remove valve cover. 
Look down pushrod at top of lifter. Do you see a little straight wire on 
each side of the lifter where the pushrod sits? If yes: hydraulic. If 
no: solids.

I used a small probe light and YES I do have hydraulics.  It made my day
:-)

Mike
