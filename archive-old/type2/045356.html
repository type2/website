Subject: [T2] dipstick, poptop questions

Howdy all!

1. How far apart are the one quart low and full 
markings on a pancake engine's dipstick?  Less 
than half an inch?  There's another mark scratched 
in mine another half inch up and I'm trying to figure 
it out.

2. My poptop doesn't stay all the way down on 
the driver's side.  I'm sure no fabric is caught up in 
there and am wondering if there is a way to adjust 
it or something?  It's been like that since I bought it, 
made for a nice draft during my winter road trip.

Thanks in advance,
Christopher Darilek
