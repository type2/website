Subject: Re: [T2] Green Westy Plaid 4 sale

FYI,
Back in March 7th 2005 I bought an oil bath air cleaner from David K.
who was selling due to the wedding. It took some serious time and
effort to have it shipped to me (got it April 13th). A fastener was
missing but the cleaner and boot were OK otherwise.

I shared my anxiety about never receiving the parts with another
member on this list who was in the same situation.

This is not a rant nor a flame, just facts

- Arnaud

&gt; I am gettig married soon and I have to make some money
&gt; for the big day. I am forced to sell a treasure that I
&gt; collected for the last few years. I have 3 large upper
&gt; bunk cushion covers and 4 small upper bunk cushion
&gt; covers for the 1976-1979 westies.
