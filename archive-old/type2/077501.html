Well, looking at the free van comments, and the fact that this guy could not
sell it before I came along, there may not be a big enough group to sell to.
I'd much rather have an older Bus...   however this is the one that I found
a good deal on.  A wise person might have once said:  &quot;If you can't find
what you want, find something else, and force it to be something it is not&quot;.

Thanks,

Bryan.

&gt; Hi Bryan and Everyone else,
&gt; If you aren't in love with this vehicle, and it
&gt; doesn't sound like you are, why not sell it to someone
&gt; looking for a Westy.  Westfalias are worth more than a
&gt; passenger van or even a Kombi.  You could buy or trade
&gt; for a better VW for your needs.  There will be much
&gt; less hassle, and we keep another vintage VW original,
&gt; everyone wins!
&gt;
&gt; Just a thought,
&gt; Rick
&gt;
