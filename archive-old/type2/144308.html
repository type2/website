&gt; Had another of those VW bonding moments yesterday. 
&gt; Pulled up to a traffic light beside an elderly black
&gt; woman in an old bug with a mismatched hood and a BIG
&gt; german shepherd in the back.  I rolled the window down
&gt; and hollered out that I sure liked her VW.  She smiled
&gt; ear to ear and said &quot;I sho do like yours too!&quot; 
&gt; Another of the small VW pleasures in life.  Cheers...KR

I had one of those moments yesterday as well.  I took the kids to sonic
last night and the place was crawling with old muscle cars and so on like
it usually is on Friday nights.  Way off on the other end of the place in
the adjoining parking lot was an early 70's / late 60's bay window bus.
The kids weren't really interested in the muscle cars, but they had to
check out the bus.  I took them to see it.  As we were pulling out of
the stall later the owners came up and made me stop so they could look
at my 78 bay window bus.  We exchanged &quot;I like your bus&quot; and so ons and
were on our way.  Those moments are all too rare.
