&gt; The solenoid I plan to use (once I locate and buy it) will be right at the
&gt; gas tank so that when it is off there is no way for fuel to leak out (in
&gt; case of fire). If the valve is anywhere else you've got fuel line between
&gt; the tank and the valve that can leak, burn, or fall off.

&gt; In my '78's case it will be gas tank, valve, filter, pump, engine.


I think you need to include the fuel rail, pressure regulator into you
equation,, and, 

And, what about the return line to the gas tank,,, won't it allow gas to fuel a
fire if it happens to get damaged?

fuel for thought! LOL
