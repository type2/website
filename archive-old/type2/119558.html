FWIW my experience with POR 15 has all been good. I did what they recommend
and put a piece of plastic wrap between the lid and the can. Then sealed it. I
have used cans that are at least a year old this way. I cannot remember the
exact results, but it definitely got used. I might have had to stir it up
some, but other than that, I had not problems.

And store it in the refrigerator
