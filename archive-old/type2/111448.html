&gt; Any remedy for saggy butt syndrome in a 1979 Westfalia? There does not seem

All bays have the same torsion bar adjustment, though there are different
angle specs for different models.

The procedure is in the Bentley.  Follow it to the letter and it works!

Be sure to douse all the fasteners you intend to remove with Liquid
Wrench, PB Blaster, or Kroil for a couple of days before you start.
