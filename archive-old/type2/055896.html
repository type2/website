Subject: 15 inch rims stock on my 64?
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

I have been told that 15 inch rims were discontinued at the end of the 63
model year, but my 64 has them and always has.  Is it possible that they were
just still using them at the beginning of the 64 model year, and if so would
my speedo read correctly?
Thanks,
dan morris
