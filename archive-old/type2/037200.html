Hello Type 2 List:

My recently acquired '76 Campmobile has a serious case of oil drip.  I 
adopted this rig from a good friend and told him I'd give it a good home.

After adjusting the valves this weekend I put on new valve cover gaskets but 
I really don't think they have contributed to the problem. I also don't 
believe it's coming from the oil filter area.

Any suggestions on how to troubleshoot and search for the specific 
location(s) of the leak?  Supposedly, the engine is a rebuilt unit with 
about 20k miles on it.  Is it possible to go to the spray wash and clean off 
the bottom of the engine without flooding things in the engine compartment?  
Any help is appreciated.

Thanks and best regards,
Walt
'76 Campmobile
