Subject: Re: (T-2) upright vs.pancake
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

 I've seen many upright converted loaves in the past few years, ranging from 
properly done with euro/ mexican tin( they came with 1600's in them  in 
Mexico until the early 90's(?) when they switched over to the 1.6L rabbit 
engine) to complete hacks with wooden engine carriers. I believe you would 
want to gear it down a bit since it is heavier( a 70's bug weighs about 2000 
lbs. empty) but by the time you change the trans, buy the tins, build a 1600 
complete, you could have a nice rebuilt 2.0L. I drive a 61 bus / truck 
conversion(aka the Bauernhofwagen) which weighs approx. 2900 lbs empty due to 
it's plate steel construction, and I'm running a 1300 sp(small valve as 
well), with slightly higher compression(again, I live at 5000 feet)- I've put 
just about 90,000 miles on this motor since I built it in Sept. 98 and it 
doesn't leak or burn a drop of oil.It hums along with 1000 lb load at 65 mph. 
In fact, it did just that all the way up to Denver 2 weeks ago with 
absolutely no problems(for those who were at Woodland Park and/or Bandimere, 
it's the really loud green thing). Acceleration's not it's strong point, but 
the 30 mpg's a plus when gas in CO is close to 2.00 a gallon. I would not let 
this salvage guy convert it over, nor would I let him touch it at all. Also, 
conversions are mainly for people who are really in tune with their bus, and 
not for the average bus driver.
