&gt; Westy down on Cape Cod Saturday when I suddenly felt and heard a banging
&gt; noise coming from the front end. Oh great, I think, It must be a wheel
&gt; bearing gone or maybe the bearing retainer nut has backed off. I pull over
&gt; to the first available spot and check things out. The left front wheel has
&gt; all the studs backed out quite far. Now, I had done some brake work on the
&gt; front end about 1k miles ago, and I am sure that I tightened everything back
&gt; up when I was done. I am picky about things like that. Has anyone else had
&gt; this happen to them?

yeah happened to me many years ago on my 60 deluxe microbus, never did
figure out why but has never happened again...I never allow the folks at
the garage to use the air wrenchs to put my lug nuts on, they have to do
it by hand and the place I prefer actually puts em on with a torque
wrench, to spec

(Doc Tim must be smiling about that place)

 &gt; Not that I'm paranoid,

be paranoid, it's your life behind that steering wheel!

&gt; will check them before every trip. Any tips for keeping them tight? 

overtightening em is just as bad as not tight enough (ask me how I know)
