Subject: so its Friday

Well its been a while since I have been on the list...so I will assume
Free Friday is still in place.
  I have read all the stuff about Type 2s being expensive to maintaine
ect etc that has been posted with some interest.
 I paid, 8 years ago, 2,200 for my bus.. financed by the sale of a
Convert. Bug for 2,500. I have put in about 500 in fixen an fussen. It
wouldnt matter how much or how little cause I like...
Sometimes at work to just go out and sit in it at lunch time.
Sometimes when I have to wait for one of my kids I can just sit in the
back and read.
The one time it stopped I just went in the back after callen AAA and
relaxed and watched the 5pm local news.
When I go out camping I always meet someone doing the same in their
bus.
Loading up with the canoe an stuff and heading for a never before seen
by me, lake or river.
Simply driving.
No Car payments.
The feeling of being at home when I climb in an sit on my worn out
driver seat.
NO CAR PAYMENTS!
Knowing that while it may use a bit more gas than some... keeping my
bus isnt contributing to the manufacture and sale of more and more
throw away cars.
NO CAR PAYMENTS!!!!
I like most of the people I like everything they do to their bus.. even
if I wouldnt... I like going to swap meets an shows and pondering new
things I can do to my bus and I realy realy like....NO CAR PAYMENTS!
   Well its lunch... guess I will wander out and sit for a while.
