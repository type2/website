&gt; Slugging Wrench per the Grainger catalog. And one helluva fine tool it

&gt; I could always see how it would harm bearings but I always wondered 
&gt; whether it would harm them if your SO stood on the brakes while you slug 
&gt; it.

I think this might be one of those &quot;sounds reasonable so it must be true&quot;
but I beat the living c$#p out of it before I had a nice 3/4 breaker and
socket set up and I swear the bearing was perfect although I replaced it
anyway (steve dolan theorem) and kept it for a spare. The drum was trashed
though.

I think I need to see proof that you could deform that bear of a roller
bearing by pounding.
