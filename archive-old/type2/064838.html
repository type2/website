Subject: Affectionate apt names...

Reading through my mail I stumble across a ref to the T2 van being called an
&quot;ox&quot; (Great TV Prog)
The german nickname for the panel van (which is how the T2 started) is laster
azel (phonetic spelling I never saw the word written)...which literally means
&quot;work donkey&quot;......my friends never thought about this name till we joked about
workhorse vehicles...seems kinda apt..
