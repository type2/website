Erich:

The buzzing probably is a sign of some fuel starvation.  You can change 
the filter(s) and see if that helps, but it probably won't.  One problem 
that crops up in cars as old as yours (and mine) is that &quot;crud&quot; 
(scientific term) accumulates in the bottom of the fuel tank, 
contributing to the problem.  I once snaked a flexible line up the outlet 
pipe and into the tank; had a quiet fuel pump for 2 or 3 days until the 
problem returned.  So, long term, the solution is probably to drop and 
clean the tank.

As to using your &quot;spare&quot; electric fuel pump.... I'm guessing you can't 
use it.  The fuel pump on the Vanagon puts out around 30 lbs. of 
pressure, and recirculates the fuel.  Unless the generic pump duplicates 
these aspects of the Vanagon pump, I don't think it'll work.

&gt; Howdy!

&gt; This is my first posting to the list so please forgive any rule breaking! 
&gt; My fuel pump on my 82 Westy is making a loud buzzing noise.  I'm going to
&gt; replace the fuel filter in the hopes that the pump is just starved for fuel
&gt; (it seems to run o.k.).  My question is this:
&gt; 
&gt; I have a generic electric pump that gets installed on an 81 F-150 when the
&gt; mechanical pump fails (an all too common occurance!).  Can this be used on
&gt; my Vanagon in an emergency?  I have to make a 4 hour trip today and since I
&gt; live in the boonies, there are no FLAPS that carry VW parts.
