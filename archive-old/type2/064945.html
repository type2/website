We were parked in my '67 camper outside a business beside the highway one
morning after sleeping there the night before. The bus was having trouble
starting, and I was back at the engine checking wiring connections. The
proprietor of the business, apparently concerned about our bus detracting from
his business offered us the advice from his VW wisdom that perhaps we were
having problems with the water pump. I thanked him, and eventually we got back
on the road...
