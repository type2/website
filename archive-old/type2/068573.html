&gt; It seems to me that because one list member had a LUCAS coil without an
&gt; external resistor (either he or the PO screwed up here not LUCAS) then
&gt; some other list members are posting things which they consdider to be of
&gt; a weak design to be LUCAS.

Good point, Bob. You can't look at one failed part and condemn them all. 
For the complete Lucas experience, one must own a car sporting Lucas 
electricals. &lt;grin&gt;

Lucas DOES have a bad rep in the US. XKE owners weren't considered 
&quot;experienced&quot; until they had survived their first electrical fire, 
and failed electricals were the most common complaint they had with 
their cars. The old Sunbeams and Hillmans I owned would carry me 
anywhere, but I always carried a complete electrical rebuild kit in the 
trunk. It was fun driving a car that you could fix along side the road.

Lucas has come a long ways since the 50s, 60s and 70s, though. I know 
several owners who've put over 60K on their cars and haven't had any 
electrical problems.
