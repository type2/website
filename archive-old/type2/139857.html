Subject: Re: [T2] Interesting garage door option for Westy owners

&gt; My garage has a swing-up door with an automated garage opener.  The
&gt; door opening is high enough for my poptop to clear, but the door gets
&gt; in the way and scrapes. I've been thinking about what to do about this,
&gt; short of parking on the street (not something I want to do). One option
&gt; I've explored is installing a roll-up overhead in place of the
&gt; swing-up, with a high track.

what about the old &quot;barn door&quot; design, that is what used to be on my
garage, if you must have power they do make openers for em, just don't get
em at your local home center

the side openers are a lot cheaper too
