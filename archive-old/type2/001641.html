An interresting thought occured to me as I tried to depart from a wet and
muddy camp-out this morning.  &quot;I probably wouldn't be stuck in the mud right
now if I had a winch mounted on the front of my bus,&quot; I mused.

Any of you volks ever consider, or actually undertake such a project?  What
would you guess is involved, electrically speaking?  Where might one find
such a device for sale?

I hated to leave &quot;Ben&quot; alone in the pouring rain (usually garage kept), with
little left to do but wait for the ground to dry in a few days.  If not a
winch, what else would be a good emergency plan for times stranded in the
boonies?  Thanks for pondering with me.       ~Drew
