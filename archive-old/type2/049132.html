Subject: Re: [T2] Stripped plug

This problem has been the bane of my vw existence, the PO was not aware of
applying anti-seize to spark plug threads, and the result was threads welded
into the head.  Fortunately, my mechanic was able to drill and tap the hole
and insert one of those timesert thingies (he doesn't like helicoils,
reckons they fall out).  The procedure involves turning the motor so that
the exhaust valve is open on the apprpriate cylinder and sticking the air
hose from the compressor in the tailpipe.  AFAIK it is not possible to pull
the heads while the engine is in car, although any reasonably competent vw
mechanic should be able to put the insert in.  Hope this helps.

Subject: [T2] Stripped plug


&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I stripped the #3 plug on my 71 westy  and as I am short on time/space to
&gt; pull the engine, the quick fix treatment is all she gets right now.
&gt;
&gt; My question is, can I pull the head on my 1600 DP without removing the
&gt; engine? If so, what hoops do I need to jump thru to make this possible?
&gt;
&gt; OR,
&gt;
&gt; Would I be better off just installing an insert into the head while still
&gt; attached?  Any concerns with shavings in the engine or squaring the
threads
&gt; correctly?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for your help
