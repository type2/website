Subject: Re: [T2] Painting type 4 fan shroud

Dave,

Hope someone answers this one!  My thoughts were to polish it on the
outside a little  and then powder coat it with clear.

But, it won't fit in my powder coating oven!

I have seen people paint them, but like you, wondered what happened 5 
years down the road.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I am debating whether to paint my fan shroud or just clean it up and leave
&gt; it.  Has anyone successfully painted theirs, and more importantly, what does
&gt; it look like 5 years or more down the road?  Is it worth it?
