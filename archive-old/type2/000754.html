. Could it be the other way around in the USA?
&gt;
Sure could.  I started teaching my daughter to drive a stick when she was
about 8 (no lectures from the cops, please).  I'm not really sure I can name
a single one of her friends that can drive a stick.  Her driver's ed class
had one to try as an option, but that was it.  I was told (would kind of
like to know if this is true, doesn't seem possible) that the military is
going to automatics because so few new troops can drive the sticks.  Tell me
that isn't true, Matthew.

Anyway, if it doesn't do anything else, it reminds you of a simpler time.
Plus, you can always push start a dead stick.  Not so much fun with an
automatic.
