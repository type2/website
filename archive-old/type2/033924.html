Subject: RE:  Pertronix Ignitor/VDO Tach

&gt;Hello all. I have a question regarding the compatibility of the Pertronix 
&gt;Ignitor and the VDO tach that Bus Depot sells. I just installed the Ignitor

&gt;and VDO tach in my westy, and the tach will not work. All the 

There are no compatibility issues between using an Ignitor and a tach.  I
put an Ignitor in my 009 dizzy on my 73 Westy a few years back and never had
any trouble with the a:) in-dash Porsche 924 tach, b:) my tach/dwell meter
hooked up at the engine end, or c:) the MG tach used for tune ups hooked up
at the engine end.  All worked just fine.  Likewise on my 914.  

I assume your bus is running nicely after the Ignitor was installed and
therefore that everything is hooked up and adjusted properly on it (ie. red
wire to positive side of coil and black to negative)?  And you know the 12v
power wire (hot when ignition is on) and the ground running to the tach are
good?  And that you've got continuity on the wire from the coil negative up
to the hookup for the tach?  Do you have any other 4-cyl engine to test the
tach on?  Or do you have any other 4-cyl tach (or tach/dwell meter) to test
on the bus?
