Subject: exhaust / high temp painting

In looking through the archives, it seems that (a) no one has had a
good experience with high temperature paints and (b) no one's posted
about it in a while. Has anyone that's had a more current experience
with POR20, BBQ paint, Eastwoods, VHT or any other manufacturer's high
temperature paint? The most recent posting in the archive dates to 2002
(Snoopy, how is the POR20 holding up?), and most of what I've found
date back to '96! These formulas must have been re-factored since then.
Any advice would be helpful.

Would it be a good idea to replace the rusted bolts (from heater boxes
to 4-&gt;1 and 4-&gt;1 to muffler) with stainless steel ones? Figured it
might be better for removing in the future, not to mention stronger as
the rusting continues.

back story:
I pulled the 4-&gt;1 off of my heaterboxes late last week to get the fan
housing backed off (the LH cooling flap fell off the rod, covering the
oil cooler. Grrr). Its got surface rust, but the steel is solid. I
figured painted steel (if the right paint is used) will be better and
last longer than the rusting exposed steel I have now. As long as its
sitting on my garage floor, I wanted to take advantage and re-install
it in better shape than it was when it came out.

Thanks for your patience everyone. I've got another un-related post
coming :)
