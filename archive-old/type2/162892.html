&gt;absolutely recommended:
&gt;
&gt;Find an empty parking lot and put your bus through its paces.  Try to
&gt;break the rear end loose and learn what that feels like.  If you live
&gt;in snow areas, do it dry and in snow.  I did this when I got here in CO
&gt;because it had been years since I'd driven in snow, and never with a
&gt;vehicle like a bus.  The bus will give you signs when you're pushing
&gt;the limits, and if you learn to recognize them when you're not under
&gt;pressure, you'll be better prepared to deal with them when you are.

	What a fine mutual admiration society
we've evolved here, at least regarding crash
avoidance.  I used to drift my '57 Splittie on
winding public roads (I was younger &amp; even more
reckless then).  The old  5.60&quot; tyres and crude
Renault-type swing-axle rear suspension oddly
worked OK.  I never went past the crucial 150 of
tail-wag.  I've not yet got around to practising
with the noo-fangled T2 suspension and fatter 185
tyres, but thanx for the reminder to do so.
	My country has just been invaded by the
S. Africa saloon-car champ  -  Renault 8 Gordini
1255cc &gt;105bhp.  (I fully expect him to clean up
the 7-litre Mustangs and other brutalisms here,
especially as I've become his water-injection
consultant  ;-} .)  He makes the point &quot;oversteer
is in principle controllable&quot;; we're not so sure
that understeer is.
	Steer into the skid; as Guac says, get
some experience with skidding in rehearsal, and
you'll have a far better chance of evading
crashes.
