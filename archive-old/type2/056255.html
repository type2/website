Subject: Type IV head replacement?

This weekend I checked the compression in my new '78 camper:

Cylinder 1: 90 psi (Upped to 100 with a few drops of oil -&gt; rings)
Cylinder 2: 0 psi
Cylinder 3: 120 psi
Cylinder 4: 114 psi

Number 2 offered no resistance and the engine turned over quickly.


Richard,

Type IV engines are expensive, but good engines that can last many a
mile. I would not replace the entire engine. $400 for labor is not out
of line to replace/repair engine.

You can get a type IV head for about $150-$200 from:

Archway - 314-638-7725
MOFOCO - (Don't have the number)
