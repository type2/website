On that oil selection.
I decided to start using straight stuff after lengthy exchanges and 
some research I did last year, just about this time, on the subject.

Discussions with some type 2 list people and phone calls to lube 
techies helped me come to the decision of straight oil for Casper.

I say this, just as point of &quot;letting you know&quot;, for whatever reason.

I think the archives might have some of that &quot;stuff&quot; from May/June, 1999.
