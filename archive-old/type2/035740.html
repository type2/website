Subject: Save the heat

I have an idea to save the heat in my '71 Westy. I propose making a cover
for the opening in the roof to the poptop. I would use snaps to hold the
cover on when not camping. Before I go to all the trouble, has anyone ever
tried this and do you think it would be worthwhile? As always, TIA

Don't take life too seriously - you'll never live through it.
