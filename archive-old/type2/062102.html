Subject: Re: Help: Oil Pressure Light ('89 Vangagon)

I know from what i've heard and read that there are a lot of people who
think that the oil light comes on too late, ie. at too low a pressure.

In my Bosch catalog i see that there are OP switches that come on much 
sooner, at a higher pressure than stock, i don't have data at hand at the 
moment. 

One could replace the stock unit with one that switches at a higher than 
stock pressure or add the heavier switch via a T and hook it up to an 
extra oillight. If you want more data, let me know.

The stock unit can also be had with a M4 threaded connection instead of a
6.3mm spade.

Brian.
