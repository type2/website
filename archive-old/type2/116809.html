Subject: Speedo Troubleshooting Help Please...

Listees,

On my 71 Westy my speedo went out as well as the odemeter. How do I tell 
what needs to be fixed? Is it the cable or did the unit go out or something?

Also I think this is totally unrelated but my brakes feel as though the 
booster isn't working, I think the ad hoc hose i used hasn't held up, I 
think there's a hold in the brake booster hose and that's why the vacuum 
assist isn't working.

All this on the last day I was going to drive it before I sell it.

Thanks in advance!!!

Daniel
