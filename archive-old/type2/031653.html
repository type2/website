&gt; miles from us, we went to help her out. Here's the situation: newly rebuilt
&gt; 1776 (she did it herself!) that she can't get to start. All the external
&gt; stuff is stock, with the exception of the Pertronix 009. It all worked

shouldn't have any effect the Pertronix

&gt; for #1. We checked for TDC when the crank pulley notch is lined up, that was
&gt; correct. All we could get it to do was backfire a bit, it never did catch

with a backfire it sounds like it should start....check the dizzy is not
180 degrees out. that will do it.

check valves with the dizzy, both valves should be closed when any cyl is
lined up to fire.
  so the first thing I would do is check that when rotor is at TDC on #1
then both valves should be closed on #1 cyl...etc

&gt; and run. With the Pertronix, is the dizzy drive being off a few degrees an
&gt; major issue, or should we be able to make it run by turning the dizzy

works exactly the same as with points
