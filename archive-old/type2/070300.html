The '76-'78 heads are different from the '79-'83.5 heads.  The exhaust
manifold to head connection on the earlier heads is (A) a different shape
(oval vs. square(r)), and (B) has a copper gasket.  The heads will
exchange, but you have to transplant the exhaust systems as well, which
usually makes the exchange impractical. Given my 'druthers I prefer the
'79-'83.5 system, as replacing those copper gaskets is a metric bear.
OTOH, I don't hate them enough that I have torn an engine apart to get rid
of them :-)

Now that we have dealt with that one, something I am curious about:

The '79-'83.5 heads didn't have the copper gaskets.  Neither do the
'72-'75. Does this mean that the ''72-'75 might interchange with the
'79-'83.5?  Or does the increase in displacement from 1700-1800 to 2L rule
that out?  Anyone?
