&gt; In continuation of the fumes in cab thing, my 78 has ducts from the side
&gt; of the heater control flaps.  Or it does now.  When I bought the bus it was
&gt; missing the flex tubing from the heater control flaps to the &quot;optional&quot;
&gt; tailpipes.  

When I installed a used '78 engine into my bus it was also missing
the flex tubing as you describe.

&gt;...
&gt; A local VW shop told me
&gt; that these flex tubes were not necessary to proper functioning of the
&gt; vehicle and even suggested I remove the tailpipes that exit just in front of
&gt; the rear wheels... 10 minutes later I walked out of AutoZone with some of
&gt; that silver flex duct stuff and four hose clamps.  I like to think that
&gt; German Engineers have some reason for adding this feature.  BTW does anyone
&gt; know what year VW started this heater bypass exhaust thing??

I started out on the 'silver flex duct stuff'.  Then I moved on to
2&quot; dia marine exhaust tubing.  It is used to direct exhaust to the
transom
of a boat (inboard w/ wet exhaust).  It takes the heat and elements,
with
a stiff wire impregnated inside it so the tubing won't collapse easily.

Good luck,
