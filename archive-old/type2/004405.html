Subject: Bus Buying ?

I am looking at a 73/74 Westfalia and I was wondering if there is anything I
should really look at for.  Is there anything about these era busses that I
should know about?  I have always had Type 1s but I feel the need for a Bus.
The only rust I can find is on the lower right section of the windshield.
It's not real bad as far as I can tell with out removing the windshield.
Other than that the body is straight.  The guy is asking $500 so I don't
think I can too wrong.
