Subject:  High cost of Q-pads

Mark,

...As you open the discussion about Q-pads, and their value versus other 
materials, I thought should respond. I am off the type2 list for right now.

Your message addresses a philosophy:    Value, versus Cost.

Cost is what comes out of your pocket today. Value is what comes out of 
your pocket over time.

In order for any restoration to be worthwhile, in my eyes, you have the 
working toward the goal of making the vehicle trouble-free for a long time 
(value).  Beyond all other goals we pursued in our restoration of that 76, 
it was trouble-free operation for 10-15 years.  Our investment was not a 
short-term investment, but a LONG-TERM investment.  From the very day we 
bought it, we spared no expense in making it perfect. Remember the old 
adage, it is the cheap man who pays the most. Very true in VW restoration.

Well before addressing any of the Sound Proofing, Rust Proofing, or heat 
related items, virtually EVERY wear related item on the bus had been 
replaced.  All shocks, brakes, rotors, drums, calipers, brake hoses, ball 
joints, tie rod ends, master and slave cylinders, battery, steering gear, 
steering pivot bearings, etc. were replaced within the first month we owned 
the van.  As you saw from a web site, the motor was rebuilt completely, new 
heat exchangers, alternator, exhaust parts, etc..

I hate spending money, so I have learned to recognize the broad difference 
between VALUE and COST.  The cost of replacing all of the above items was 
quite high.  However, the cost could been quite a bit higher, had we merely 
replaced the brake pads, and then gone for our 10k spin across country.

Had a slave cylinder failed somewhere in southern Montana in the middle of 
the winter, I would've cursed myself a blue vein for not spending the extra 
19 dollars for lousy slave cylinder while the brakes were completely apart. 
The cost of Q-Pads was never an issue.

As far as the Kool Patch versus Q-pads debate, as far as I'm concerned, 
there is no reason to debate. It is like debating whether to use Casterol 
20w50 or Wesson Corn Oil in your crankcase (everyone knows to use Crisco).

They are to vastly different products, used for to vastly different 
reasons.  Kool Patch is undercoating.  It protects the body from rust. It 
already contains fiberglass. That's what makes it so thick and strong. I 
used it on the interior in places that would be sealed, and never touched, 
as Kool Patch leaches a thick, black tar-like substance that would ruin my 
Sunday dress and white gloves.

Q-pads, on the other hand, deaden low-frequency resonance. They keep sheet 
metal from transmitting noise.

Automobile manufacturers and body shops use Q-pads almost exclusively for 
one reason: no cheaper solution works.  Tear back the trunk carpeting in 
your Jetta, look at the floor of your Golf, look under the carpeting in a 
Honda, a Ford, a Chevy, even the lowliest model of Toyota has Q-pads on the 
floor. They work, and if car companies could find a less expensive 
solution, they would be using it.

The reason for the apparent &quot;redundance&quot; of the products in the interior 
installation was to both deaden the noise, AND to prevent interior-out rust 
through that is prevalent in &quot;sleep-in&quot; vehicles.

I would never encourage someone whose bus is in need of brakes to spend 
$400 dollars on Q-pads.  We have not sound-proofed our current van, simply 
because we are accruing cash toward other things, like rebuilding the motor 
to be silky smooth. I would propose that the operation of the vehicle is 
vastly more important than the sound proofing.

I have an update to the website that includes about fifty more pictures, 
diagrams, and (if I can work it right) a sound file of the doors closing on 
an un-insulated bus, and the dors closing on our (former) 1976. Hope to 
have it posted in the next couple weeks.

Thanks for the continued interest.
