Netcarrier once again had an email server problem overnight.  My e-mail
service was down from midnight until 8 am today.  If you sent me a message
to ron_at_netcarrier_dot_com last night or early this morning, please re-send it as
it probably bounced.  This did not affect Bus Depot email sent to
sales_at_busdepot_dot_com.

Thanks,
