Hi !

Sorry to bother you but I need help from somebody on the
type2 list. Got your address from the list.
Of some strange reason I can't send any messages to the list. 
I have been in contact with Queena in the The eGroups Team.
But she? was unable to help me.

Can you please send this message to the list for me ??
Thanks in advance...

Subject: Smoke in exhaust, oil in cylinder. Help !

Hi !

I have had a strange rattle from the engine ( type 4 1700cc ) for about
2000Km. Very irregular, as from a lose metal plate. Usually not heard
right after start, but after 1-3 minutes running and rpm &gt;= 1500. 

About 300Km ago a new problem emerged. A few minutes after start
a LOT of grey smoke ( not black, not blue ) comes out of the exhaust pipe.
Usually seen when I stop at a red light[ car behind disappears ;-(  cough cough ]
After an another 1-2 minutes things go back to normal( almost ?).
Changing rpm makes no difference

Yesterday I left the bus to cool down. Then I removed the spark plugs and probed
with a stick in the cylinders. I found oil in rear-left cylinder. :-( Thats where the smoke
comes from. Question: how does the oil get there ? I assume I have to pull the engine
but I would like to have a proper diagnose before I pull.
What confuses me is that there is no smoke during normal driving.

 What's up ? Any suggestions ?
