Well, there's a reason that they had two!  It has to do with getting
proper venting with the tank full and on an incline without accidently
starting a siphon.

Now, you might well get away with using one vent for the return, but I
really don't like the idea of returning the gas to the top of the tank.
The constant agitation of the fuel is probably not a good thing.

If your tank has a removable outlet like my '71, I'd really look at making
a custom dual outlet/return.  Basically, it would be two tubes going
through a metal washer and brazed in place.  One would be the feed, the
other the return.  A small separation (say 10cm) on the inside of the tank
would be plenty to keep cool fuel going to the pump.

If you can weld, this should be an easy, clean solution to the problem.
