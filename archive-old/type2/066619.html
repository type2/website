Subject: RE: Ball Joint Thread Continued

When I replaced the ball joints on my 70, all the boots were torn. Once I 
got them off the car and was able to rotate them, Iearned why it's so 
important to have the rubber seal in good shape--they were gritty and didn't 
rotate freely. I guess you could clean them out as well as possible, seal 
them with tape, but you're just buying a little time. Once the dirt gets in 
there, I doubt you'll be able to get it out. Ball joint destruction soon 
follows.

I have at least one ball joint boot on my '77 westy which is torn.
