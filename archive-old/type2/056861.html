Subject: Pop-top canvas ?

A while back someone posted a question regarding the replacement of the
mosquito screen on the front window of the pop-top.  My canvas is in
good shape too but the zipper to the canvas flap is ruined so it can't
be zipped up.  It didn't see a response to the question so I am
wondering if anyone has ever tried to replace just the window and saved
the rest of the canvas.  I really don't want to take off the canvas but
it looks kind of hard to hand sew.  If worst comes to worst I will
probably end up replacing the whole canvas.  Is this a hard job?  Do the
new ones fit exactly like the original?  Where is the best place to buy
one?  Thanks again.
