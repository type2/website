&gt; At present, I have only two samples, tho.  The first is the Mustard
&gt; colored cloth used in the '73 Westy, the second, I don't know, but *think*
&gt; it is the orange plaid from the '76-79 Westies.


This plaid is '76-77 only.  This color was used on Chrome Yellow Westies,
and also on a small quantity of white, non-poptop weekenders imported during
the same two years.   In all years from '74 on (at least in the U.S.), you
could actually determine the color of the vehicle from the color of the
plaid (or visa versa); each exterior color came with a specific colored
plaid interior.  From '75 on, you could not only determine the color plaid
used by looking at the exterior color of the camper, but even what camper
ammenities it had inside.  For example, in 1976-77 if you wanted a poptop
Westy with no stove, you got a chrome yellow camper with yellow/green plaid.
If you wanted a model with a stove (and other &quot;extras&quot; such as front table,
trash recepticle, and electric fridge) you got a sage green camper with
green plaid.  Kinda like Henry Ford's philosophy (you could have any color
Model T you wanted as long as it was black)  - but in neon.
