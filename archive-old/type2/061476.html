Todd and the list...
&lt;When was the clutch assembly replaced and who did the job?&gt;
It was replaced about 3 weeks ago by me.
&lt; Why was it replaced and did they only replace those three items?&gt;
I was in there and I figured I better since I'm not in there that often. 
Yes, clutch disc, p plate and t/o bearing.  Forks looked ok....
&lt; No other noise noted other than the grind?&gt; 
Just a bang and a grind then another grind, then no odd / expensive sounds.
&lt; When does it grind?&gt;
It doesn't grind now. Not in gear or out of gear.
&lt; When you attempt to move the gearshift lever?&gt;
No, not at all.
&lt; Grinds both with and without the clutch disengaged?&gt;
Neither.....
&lt; Any other problems or noises associated with the trans before this??&gt;
Have to almost be stopped to downshift into 1st..... slight grind going
into 3rd (upshift)....... Other than that, not really.

I appreciate all the ideas you folks have given me to look into... I will
let 
all of you know what I find.
Thanks
Mark
