Hi Chris, 


&gt; ...1969 bus 191625 built spring 1969 odometer is located in the
&gt; upper portion of the speedo.

I think ir probably changed somewhere in 1968 or with the change of
model year 1968 -&gt; 1969. The 1968 busses have more weird things. For
example the doorhandles are different than on 1969 and earlier years.

&gt; I noticed by looking at your webpage that you are European. Is your
&gt; speedometer in Kilometers of miles per hour? That may be the difference.

Our speedometers are in Kilometres (don't know about the UK). But that's
not the difference, We have both types of speedos here as well.

&gt; I also wanted to ask you about the bus on your webpage that is white over
&gt; green. It has turnsignal lenses that appear to be from a split screen bus.
&gt; Is this a custom item or a Euro spec?

It was put on the bus by the previous owner. Hij closed the old openings
by welding in metal and cut holes in the lower part of the front. They
don't attach to the body very well.
