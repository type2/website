&lt;&lt; I also noticed that the coloration of the &quot;Golden Oak&quot; stain differed
 between the real Baltic Birch (that I used in most spots including the
 headliners)and the paper thin veneer crap (that I used on the driverside
 long wall). The veneer ended up looking browner. I barely wiped any stain on
 the rest of the wood and it came out fine.

It is always a good idea to put a sealer coat on any soft or very thin wood
before you stain it.  There are several ways to do this, you can buy sealer
made for this, or MinWax makes a sealer/stain combo.  I take the varnish or
polyurethane and cut it down by 50%, and lightly rub it on with a rag.  After
this dries, you can apply the stain.

You may want to test this on a scrap piece of baltic birch first, because I
don't think you will need it here, but I would seal any veneer, or luan
products before staining it.

You can also purchase non-yellowing varnish.  Even clear varnish products may
yellow, so make sure the label says it is non-yellowing.

I would also stay away from water based polyurethane unless you want a totally
clear finish with no darkening.  These products will make the wood look
exactly like it does before you apply the finish.  Most oil based varnishes
will darken the wood a little.  When I refinish furniture I count on the final
coat giving the wood a deep color to it, where it highlights the grain.  If
you decide to use the water based poly, keep in mind that you need to stain or
seal it first to get the look you want before you apply the top coat.
