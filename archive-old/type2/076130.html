Subject: Re: [T2] tires

&gt;Either the Michelin MXT Reinforced 205/70R14 or the BF Goodrich 
Radial All 
&gt;Terrain T/A 27X8.50 R14LT/C.  If anybody would like to give me 
their $.02 

Oh yeah, we can do that.  :)

I haven't run the Michelins but I have run the BFGs.  They fit 
fine, look great, and provide excellent stability and handling.  
They are also very good offroad tires, as you probably know.  

The one drawback was increased NVH, which ranged from not much 
when they were new to considerable when they were down to 50% 
tread.  If you can live with that and value their strong points, 
then the BFGs are the tires for you.

If a smooth, quiet ride is very important to you and you never go 
offroad, then I would consider the Michelins instead.
