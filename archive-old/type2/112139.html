Subject: Re: [T2] Chrome plating...now I know!

&gt; the only
&gt; two places within 
&gt; 250 miles that I could find wanted upwards of $300
&gt; *each* to replate
&gt; my bumpers.

OUCH !!!!

where do you live? Here in Riverside, CA there
fortunately have some chrome shops left, but for how
long? 250,000 to get on a waiting list and licensing
etc, sounds insane..

OTOH, Im having my other two empi 5 spokes for my
notch chromed for $100 each..(before its too late))

peace,
