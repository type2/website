&gt; Good bussing gang...I can't believe nobody else is
&gt; into sharing

How long have you been on this list? Are you signed up
at AIRS? This list is all about sharing. 
There are lots of parts and information given away on
this list. People travel to help others. Were you
around when Nikki needed help and got it from
listmembers? That was sharing.
Our busses are our babies and others may not baby them
as we do. I drive my bus every day and when I go on
vacation, I go in my bus, all the way. I'm not
interested in using someone else's baby.
