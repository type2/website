Subject: Sunroof on a Dual Cargo door Bus

I was thinking of putting a ragtop in my '58 Bus. First how hard is that.
Second the Bus has dual cargo doors( cargo doors on the passanger and 
driver side). Being that the bus is a &quot;Unibody design&quot; how well would 
the bus hold up with a sunroof on it? 

Another side question, how many of the dual cargo door buses were made? 

 Any info would be appreciated....
