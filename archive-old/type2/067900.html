Subject: Re: Dumb Heat Question

You know how a woodstove works? You put wood into it, fire it up, and it
radiates heat. Up in the mountains, you used to be able to pick up a decent
woodstove for $300 or so...brand spankin' new. Then the engineers got ahold
of them, started adding blowers and thermostats and such, and now you need a
cool grand to get into a basic model.

You guys have come up with some good arguments and ideas, but if I had that
much $$$$ to spend on more heat, I'd just go for a newer model gas heater
and be done with it (I could prolly heat my neighbor's bus too with one of
those). As much as I'd like to think I'll win the lottery or learn to save
big bucks that my wife won't mind me spending on the bus, it just ain't
gonna happen.

I'll probably live with the lack of heat for another winter or two
(especially since my bus will prolly be in Arkansas while I'm in Tennessee
until Christmastime)...but from the feedback, here's what I think the simple
system might look like:

1. External oil cooler mounted insight, just inside the bus...in the back,
maybe even under the seat/bed in a westy.

2. Basic 12v fan...you can mount the switch for the fan up front...I've even
got one.

3. Oversized oil pump (gear) to better handle the extra oil...my bus has one
already, I think.

4. Shutoff valve to minimize startup wear. Figure this mounts as close to
the engine as practical.

5. Pressure guage...and what the hey, a temp guage...and senders.

6. Heavy jacket for short trips.

Here's the operating scenario:

A. Don't use this thing on the way to work and back unless you're driving
30-40 minutes...or it's really cold.

B. For longer trips, start the engine with the valve off. Let the bus warm
up and build oil pressure. When the pressure's up, turn the valve on.

C. If you mounted the cooler under the back seat, open the cabinet door and
turn on the fan...this is where the heat comes from when you have a gas
heater installed, only through ductwork and with the help of a serious fan.

D. Drive on, hippies. Watch those gauges. Enjoy the stares and peace signs.

E. When you get where you're going, turn the valve off. (Hey, you gotta
remember to shut the valve, or you risk damage, but this is the kind of
thing us poor people have been doing forever. We know when to stoke the
stove: when we're too cold. I've driven combination cars all my life, so
it's no biggie.)

So, looks like I can have this thing in the bus for the price of an external
oil cooler, an installation kit, some gauges and senders I need anyway, and
a cutoff valve. I'll think on it a while. If I decide to do it, I'll let you
all know how it works out.

Still unknown, how would the differential of oil affect the engine. That is,
with the valve open, there's say 5 qts. with the valve closed, there's 5
pts. How do I know that I'll have 5 pts. when I shut off the valve? Do I
shut it off with the bus running...or do I wait til it's cooled down? Or do
I call Cousin Jeb and have him help me install a woodstove?

Don't think I'm not grateful for all the suggestions; I'm just too poor and
uneducated to get fancy. 8) Joe
