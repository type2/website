&gt; Hello Everyone, I have a 70 westy. I need to replace the front beam.
&gt; My thought is why not replace it with a disc front end? What will
&gt; work? I have a complete 71 beam and a complete 74 beam. Who`s done it
&gt; before? Thanks for any advise.Dave Parsons

That would be me :-)  I am up to four beams replaced and counting.  I have
put an article in the library on it.  If you have any questions that
article does not answer, lemme know!

I am, however, not too sure on the interchange issue.  I know the bolt
pattern changed at some point, but I don't know when.  Someone?
