After receiving 3 suggestions that my problem was the cyl head temp 
sender/wire, i went outside and checked it out. with the pressure of my 
pinkey the wire fell apart at the splice!
  I figure i would have found this if i wasnt in such a rush to get to work, 
but i wouldnt have taken the time till maybe as late as sunday to try it 
again. It started nicely, and ran like it was very cold. I didnt give it a 
chance to warm up since my naighbors window is as close a mine to the bus, 
and they are old and grumpy.
 
thanks again
Matt O.
