For 1 it depends on which dizzy you have to make sure they will work. I have
them on my wifes car, 90% of my customers (daily drivers) and also on my
daily driver DD panel. The set in  now are on there 3rd different engine and
I know have over 40,000 miles on them. Bus starts at the touch of the key
and I personally have never had a failure. Just remember that the plug gap,
wires and coil affect how the compufire will work and last.

Hi, anybody have any experience with a compu-fire pointless ignition system?
Was wondering what is involved to convert from standard points to something
solid state. &quot;pointless&quot; no pun intended! LOL

Thank You,
