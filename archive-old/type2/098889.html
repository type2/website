&gt;
&gt;&quot;So, could this be a suppressor for the radio interference that Canadian 
&gt;vehicles were required to be equipped with?&quot;
&gt;
&gt;So, what is it with radio interference?  I thought that since the radio was 
&gt;in the front, and the electrical fields were in the rear, that there was 
&gt;enough separation in distance that there would not be an influence on the 
&gt;radio.

It's not a wireless issue. The interference is caused by the ignition system and the same 12v is powering the radio.
