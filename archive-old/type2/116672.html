Subject: High Country Bus Fest: Carabus &amp; Breakfast Sign-Up

Hey VOLKS:

there was a little confusion on my last post about the carabus sign-up and 
the breakfast list for the FMBC Burritos.

The sign-up lists are on the Full Moon Bus Club MSN group site.  If you want 
to sign-up on either of these lists you will need to register to the FMBC 
site. It only takes a second and you can select to never receive any emails.

HOWEVER at the top of each page you will see either my or Snoopy's email 
listed.........email us your information and we will gladly post it up for 
you. You do not need to register to view the lists and check to see who has 
already posted.

  To sign up and see if anyone is carabusing from your area to HCBF:
  http://groups.msn_dot_com/FullMoonBusClub/carabustohcbf.msnw

  To sign up for making breafast donations for the FMBC Burritos:
  http://groups.msn_dot_com/FullMoonBusClub/hcbfbreafastsignup.msnw

I apologize if this is an inconvience,  I wish i had the net skills to post 
an interative sign-up list on the main HCBF site.  Just email me with your 
info and I can post it to the lists for you.


Thanks, have a great weekend!
Buddah
