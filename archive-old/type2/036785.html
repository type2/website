Subject: re: mark stephens 96's

I have some input to the earlier conversation.
1) 79-83 bus cali fuel injection - the O2 sensor does not control mixture, 
it only helps with emissions. There is still a head temp sensor greatly 
contributing to the emissions.
2) By adding the Air/fuel ratio guage and inline potentiometer to the head 
temp sensor, you trick the computer into thinking the engine is cold and it 
sends more fuel or pulses the injector longer. There is no need to mess with 
fuel pressure because fuel pressure has nothing to do with rich or lean, 
just maintaining the pulse pressure in the injector. If you want to send 
even more fuel, just step up to a bigger injector as long as it's made by 
bosch. Like say from a 2.3litre ford.
3) to flow more air, get rid of the air box and strap a k&amp;n air filter to 
your AFM.
4) Those 96mm piston and cylinder kits are made in the USA
5) Want to use stock pistons? Add a stroker crank to get 2156cc like I have 
with the mark stephens setup and HAUL ASS with no drivability problems.

Peace, Sam.
