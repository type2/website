Hey Everyone!
I always like to check in with the experts before I head out on a road trip
with my trusty 1976 camper bus. It has a 2000cc engine and is twinkie
schoolbus yellow orange.

Two things:
The gas gauge is not giving me accurate readings of how much gas is in the
tank. I will fill it up and then 25-30 miles later the gauge will have gone
all of the way down. Sometimes it will come up again part way, maybe when I
go around a sharp turn, maybe not.  How can I check to see if the sensor is
not in the right place or something?

Second, we have just gotten our bus back from our mechanic and it has been
sitting outside in the rain and it happens to have little leaks due to old
seals. So there is mold everywhere! Some places more than others, like the
passenger seatbelt and the pop-top canvas. There is also some on the
upholstery. Can anyone recommend a good mold out solution? Bleach?


Thanks guys, you rock!!
