Subject: Re: [T2] top speed

My first car was a 1930 Austin 7, with a 750 cc side valve engine, an updraft 
carburetor and a gravity feed fuel tank under the bonnet above my feet.
Driving from London to Oxford one dark night I was stopped for speeding down 
hill in a 30 mph zone.
The local paper has a sub-headline in the local news, &quot;He didn't know his car 
would go so fast&quot; 42 Mph!
