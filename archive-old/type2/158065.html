Subject: Re: [T2] VW Resto -- Coralee

The organization is a bit disorganized.  I suggest contacting the owner and bringing your tools.  He is very easy to work with, and seems to price things reasonably. I think that the main focus of his business is restorations.

I bought my bus from him, actually, and I have visited for parts and repairs a few times.  I had a friend who worked there for a time.  It has been a while since I have stopped by, but I drove by a month ago and his collection seems to keep growing, so I am pretty sure he is still there.

This is the contact info that I have for the owner, it may not be current:

Wayne Marek 
&lt;volkswayne_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt;
&quot;You can reach me during the day at 804-731-2910 or evenings 804-861-0936.&quot;    

Location is somewhere near here:

http://maps.google_dot_com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=disputanta,+va&amp;om=1

Which is probably 25 miles south of Richmond, just outside of Petersburg.

His place is un-missable it will be on Highway 460 (county road) the right side heading away from Petersburg.
