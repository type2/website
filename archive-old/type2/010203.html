William,
good question here.  i wondered the same thing a
year or so ago when the cab occasionally took
in some road debris while all windows were shut.
anyhow, i purchased some gray plastic screening at
a hardware store.  it is 1/8&quot; mesh.  cut it
to size, actually made it a tad larger so 
the screws which hold the nose vent to body
secured screening material at the same time.
works wonderful and i have an endless supply.
cheap too...

be well,
- michael
