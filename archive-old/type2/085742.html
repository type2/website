Subject: Re: [T2] clutch from 1700 with 2000 engine



Hi Volks,

In my Muir Book Chapter XX page 435, co-authors John Hilgert and Peter 
Achwanden discuss a problem with a 75 transmission in a 78 bus. Oil seal 
failures along with pilot shaft bearing  failure. Cause was “the pilot shaft 
on a ‘75 is too short for a ‘78 only a ‘76 to ‘78 will work.”
Also somewhere I read that optimum valve size for FI and Carbs are not the 
same.

Good luck.

&gt;Hi Volks,
&gt;
&gt;Last summer Dave Ireland &lt;direland_at_golden_dot_net&gt; put a 2L engine into his 73
&gt;automatic bus using the original 73 dual carbs. He was told that Mikuni 
&gt;jets
&gt;for Yamaha motorcycles fit the solex carbs, and are $CDN3.00 each from a
&gt;Yamaha dealer. They worked fine for him.
&gt;
&gt;Happy trails,
&gt;

&gt; &gt;&gt; My post wasn't very clear, I'm afraid.
&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm having a new engine put into my 73 Bus. My bus is stock with the
&gt; &gt;&gt; original clutch and tranny. What I was wondering, is will the 2000cc 
&gt;engine
&gt; &gt;&gt; be a direct replacement without modification to the stock 73 clutch? 
&gt;Are any
&gt; &gt;&gt; other modifications needed for the 2000? If so, I will go with the 
&gt;1800cc
&gt; &gt;&gt; engine.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The 2.0 will bolt in if you use the 73 flywheel and clutch.
&gt; &gt; I am assuming you will be using the 73 carbs? If yes, then you will need 
&gt;a
&gt; &gt; small electric fuel pump. The 2.0L has no provisions for a mechanical 
&gt;pump [in
&gt; &gt; the USA].
&gt; &gt; Use all the engine tin from the 1700, along with all the exhaust from 
&gt;the 73.
&gt; &gt; And the 73 alternator support.
&gt; &gt; One thing I would do is find bigger jets for the carbs. They went bigger 
&gt;from
&gt; &gt; 1700 to 1800. Now you are going 200 cc larger. Got a 68-79 Bentley? If 
&gt;yes, go
&gt; &gt; to section 3, page 30. That page shows all the differences between the 
&gt;carbs
&gt; &gt; for 72 to 74.
