Subject: Re: [T2] oil temp sensor

You can drill on one side of the raised part ONLY - I found out the hard way
... Part of the plate covers an area where the sender would interfere with
the block.

If you find the VW diagram onlin: this is not fool-proof either, because it
does not tell you whether the measurements refer to the inside or outside of
the plate. I went by the instructions when I drilled my first cover in the
wrong place.

When you remove the plate from the engine, mark the area that is &quot;off
limits&quot; - i.e. where a chunk of shiny aluminum occupies the space your
sender would go. Also take notice of your dipstick tip. Probably not good if
it interfered with the sender.
