&gt;Below is a list of questions that I am despirately seeking answers to.  
&gt;Please feel free to reply to me directly, so as not to bother the rest of the 
&gt;list with my novice questions.  Any help I can get is EXTREMELY appreciated.

Questions -- and answers -- are what this list is all about.  And I don't
think anyone will kick about &quot;novice&quot; questions.  All you guys that consider
yourselves VW experts, raise your hand.  See?  Hardly anyone.  OK, now those
of you who are still novices, raise your hand.  See what I mean?


&gt;2.  If I wanted a more powerful engine, what would be the most logical 
&gt;choice?  Would all the bus parts still interchange with it?  (I know, I 
&gt;know...it's a bus, not a race car...but I'd still like it to have some punch 
&gt;to it.  Nothin wrong with that, is there?)

As a fellow novice and the owner of a 72 bus with a 78 2L engine, I can say
that such a setup is a two-edged sword.  More power, it's true.  But I don't
really think it's that much more power; it's still a low HP 4-cylinder
engine in a rather heavy vehicle.  And I have all the difficulties
associated with an engine from one year in a bus of another.  Stock is
simpler.  Certainly the 1600 engine would be easier to work.  One person can
pull the engine.

Someone told me that the cooling tin is different for the 1.6 and the 2.0L.
I don't know if that's true or not.  If so, it's more stuff to replace...


&gt;4.  My wife has no clue how to drive a manual.  Of course, she'll learn.  I 
&gt;heard a rumor someplace that doesn't SEEM very likely to me, so maybe this 
&gt;would be the best place to ask it.  A very unreliable source told me that VW 
&gt;had also made automatic transaxles?  I'm not sure how true this rumor is, but 
&gt;I've personally never seen one in magazines or catalogs.  Can anyone shed 
&gt;some light on this for me?

Yes they did.  Though I don't know which years had it.  An auto will have
even less power than a manual.  I used to drive a 72 pinto wagon w/auto;
0-60 in 60 seconds... :-P
