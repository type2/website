Subject: Re: [T2] need help with rust - TRY THIS

Hey Mike.
Thanks for the tip, I was looking at POR-15 but no one mentioned it 
so I dismissed it. Do you think that it is better than a 
zinc-chromate primer? I also saw at motorworks_dot_com the super starter 
test kit, do you think that this would be enough to cover the floor? 
If so it would be a great way to try it out and see how well it 
performs. Eventually I want to grind down the bus and cover it with a 
rust inhibitor (the rust spots) and a primer so Im using this as a 
testing ground for later.

thanks for the advice.
todd.

&gt;I've been following this thread along as something of a lurker.  But I
&gt;thought I'd add my thoughts.  I'm glad you found the zinc-chromate primer. 
&gt;VW used this stuff in the primer process before painting in original
&gt;construction.
&gt;Corroless is a product handled by the Eastwood Company
&gt;(www.eastwoodcompany_dot_com).  They claim that it stops rust by (in part) laying
&gt;down a protective layer of glass leaves and sealing the rust in.  Lots of
&gt;folks swear by this stuff.
&gt;Frankly, I'm kinda surprised that nobody (maybe I missed a posting) has
&gt;mentioned POR-15.  Insofar as I am concerned this stuff is the definitive
&gt;answer to rust.  It encapsulates rust in a plastic non-permeable envelope. 
&gt;Those who have used it are quickly convinced that this product is THE answer
&gt;to rust.  I'd urge you to visit the Restomotive website at www.por15_dot_com 
&gt;By the way, the rest of the chemicals made by Restomotive are equally
&gt;impressive.
