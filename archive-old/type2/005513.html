Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Drive Away Tent OEM / NFS

The library at type2_dot_com lists &quot; tent&quot; and has a lot of
information , including mention of the date code location
for the Drive-Away tent.
On my new one, purchased from the original owner,
the date &quot; August 1969 &quot; is rubber stamped to the right inside
of the front door on the orange canvas, while the inspector's stamp
is on the gray floor material just below that.
I was concerned that the &quot; mattress police &quot; would be upset over
not finding an actual tag sewn into the floor/ wall seam
( This tag not to be removed -under penalty of law :) but
the owner assured me that never happened.
Other tents do have a tag, sewn inside at the left of the door
or under the left side window ( facing out ).

&gt;On this tent thing, I've read two now that feel certain of the year of their
&gt;tent.  Can you tell me where or how to find the date?
&gt;BTW, my poles don't seem to have a color, should I be concerned?
