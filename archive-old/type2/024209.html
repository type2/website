Subject: They are all becoming deals!!
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Is the splitty still for sale in San Diego?? I could use another project and 
my old man lives in Escondido.  I live in Germany right now and it seems that 
most of the quality buses are making the trip back from the U.s and not the 
other way around.  If you find a deal then jump on it cause they are dying as 
fast as 90 year old men.
Peace Out
