&gt;Without the CO2 sensor in it, I don't think the computer

&gt;and bolt shop, find a nut that fits the new CO2 sensor threads and have a
&gt;welding shop weld the nut in the exhaust piece. I am going to guess were 
&gt;the
&gt;correct position is going to be since I can't find any real pictures of how
&gt;or where this item is install, except that its on top of this y-corner 
&gt;piece
&gt;of exhaust.  Have you seen any pictures of an exhaust system 77-79 that
&gt;clearly shows were the CO2 sensor is positioned??

It's a O2 sensor, not CO2.
77-79 Fed buses didn't have it. Only 79 Calif. The 79 Cal exhaust is totally 
different. Do you have a Bentley? If yes: go to sec. 5. Page 13 shows 72-74, 
79 Fed is just like it except where the flanges bolt to the ports on the 
heads. Now go to page 15. Bottom right corner. See the drawing? That's 79 
Cal only. See the dark dot by the Y where it enters the cat? That's the O2 
sensor.
If you have the 76-78 system with the Y before the cat as shown on the left 
side of page 15, there is a test port for sampling before the cat. However 
it is pointing straight down [a long O2 sensor would get wacked off ;(] and 
it is very small.
