Jon,
Welcome aboard!!

Sound's like a great investment!!

I am sure there will be those who will disagree, but I look for busses *
especially busses under $500* that are cosmetically clean, with as little
rust as possible, and  0 collision damage.  That's because,  I can repair or
replace most  mechanical parts, but I must farm out body&amp; paint work.

So if it qualifies, as a fairly clean 68 go for it.  But, be prepared! The
last bus I bought for $400.00 has over $6,000 invested in it.

&gt; hello list,
&gt;   im new here, but not new to the vdub world.  I'm looking to buy  a 68
&gt; bayfront which has been sitting since 1984, not running but will turn
over.
&gt; I guess im just looking for any information on whether this will be a good
&gt; investment or not.  by the way he only wants 500 for it.
&gt;
&gt;  thanks in advance for any info and guidance you can give me.
&gt; Hope to see alot more of all of you.    Jon
