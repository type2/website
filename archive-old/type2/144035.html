&gt; I have talked with this guy several times, and seen him driving down
&gt; the road!  Wild sight!

Oh, that is just too cool!  Looks like the guy is equipped to give out
grid squarees to the deserving on 50, 144, 220, 440, 1200 and 2400MHz, all
without leaving the driver's seat!

And I thought that my T-hunting quad looked funny sticking up throught the
passenger window!
