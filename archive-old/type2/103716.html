&lt;&lt; So let me ask this.  what distributor is? &gt;&gt;

No question about it, the correct model #, original stock distributor is the 
best.  There is a very complete list in the library of type2_dot_com.  

If you can't find a rebuilt or used correct stock distributor, contact John 
at aircooled_dot_net and get one of their dual advance distributors.  Have your 
engine specs ready.

Third best would probably be a centrifugal only advance .050 distributor.  It 
can be timed closer to your engine's specs and will run OK, though you will 
sacrifice some performance and fuel economy.
