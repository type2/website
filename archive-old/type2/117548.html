Subject: Re: [T2] rear brake pad retaining pins

&gt; I'm having a terrible time getting the replacement brake pad retaining
&gt; pins/springs to go back on the rear brakes of my 71.  I've just about
&gt; come to the conclusion that the pins are too short.  I tried and tried
&gt; and tried and tried to make the new pins and springs go on, but they
&gt; just won't.  I also tried to put the old springs back on with the new
&gt; pins and that won't work either.  All I can think of is that the new
&gt; pins are too small.  Has anyone else had a similar problem or have any
&gt; tips for getting these darn things in place?

are you putting them in facing the right way round, one hole is larger
than the other.??  have you tried putting the pins in without the spring
to see if they fit??

 I have always had to tap mine back in lightly with a hammer and punch to
get em seated
