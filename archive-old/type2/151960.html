I'm assuming you've tried the other positions with no different results..

&gt; first gear will engage. I thought I heard a strange rattling noise
&gt; before the failure, but it could've been one of the million pieces of

&quot;strange&quot; noises are always ominous until determined to me inert.  have
heard many noises from tranny but not a rattling.

&gt; car junk bouncing around the cab. The fluid doesn't smell, but it was
&gt; extremely rainy today and I couldn't inspect anything, and also the

check again when you can.

&gt; fluid has been changed twice in the last month. The first time I
&gt; changed it there was a good amount of sparkly metal in the drain pan.
&gt; It was strangely beautiful.

might want to drop it again, the tiny bits of sparkly metal are not
usually a problem.  look for bits and pieces.  maybe strain your tranny
fluid. the stuff that doesn't strain would be the problems.   an old piece
of window screen makes a good strain for this.

&gt; The leak was an ongoing problem and the fluid was often times low. I

low fluid means no go, usually will stop going before damage

&gt; hate to be suspicious of my mechanic. It was the first time I ever used
&gt; him and he seems knowlegable.

I might trust 5 people in the country with an auto tranny, and I haven't
found 4 of them. and not sure of the 5th.   Doc Tim says he knows someone
and I trust much of what Doc Tim says but he is in Washington state.

&gt; But this did occur within a hundred miles
&gt; of him servicing the transmission. I'll talk with him first thing in
&gt; the morning.

the service manual says of the problem.  probable cause.

&quot;2nd gear brake - piston seal damaged&quot;

??? I would suspect a link..

&gt; I appreciate any other information to troubleshoot this problem. And
&gt; yes, I will buy the big Bentley book someday.

by the big Bentley book yesterday, but most of the stuff I'm telling you
about the tranny isn't in the green Bentley book, I have the VW trouble
shooting manual and the orange service manual.  (bus Depot &quot;might&quot; have
the trouble shooting manual, he had a couple but I don't think they were
on his web site.  RON??)  the green Bentley covers the 003 tranny but the
late buses had the 010 tranny

good luck
Bob
