Subject: Differences in Westies

Stephen White and I have had a e mail or two about the different ways
you could receive a Westfalia from 68 to at least 72, my year. Since
mine has no pop top I have always called it a weekender, it has the full
camper set up other wise. This is what Steven wrote:


 I still think there were 3 basic westies available at that time
frame...

1) weekender - full width back seat no cabinet, no jumpseat
2) hardtop - regular backseat with cabinet &amp; jumpseat
3) poptop - same as 2 but with pop-up roof

but i could be wrong... thogh i have seen all 3 in person and definitely

they were stock and not modified.



So.... could someone shed some light on the different ways you could
request a westie and what each version was refereed to?


Thank ya so much.
