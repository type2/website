Subject: Slightly used pistons

I am trying to determine my best (read decent) options for rebuilding an
engine for my westy that's been sitting for ~6 years.  About 6 years ago
I bought a sh*ty rebuild from my local FLAPS.  Not knowing anything
(stupidity of youth) about VW's at the time, I paid a core charge and
took delivery of a bug short block complete with adapter:-(  It promptly
blew up due to improper compression(less than 50 miles later), AND
twisted the #1 journal in the case.  Bad Case. Recently bought an AS41
complete engine from a running bus.  When I removed the tin, I found the
cylinder studs on the top rear (FIF)#2 and 4 cylinders broken.  The
bottom end seems o.k. so far.  More inspection to do.  The question is
can I use the pistons off the bad rebuild (still have hone marks)?
Also, the pistons are not necessarily in the original cylinders;).  Is
this a problem?  What problems can I expect to find due to the broken
head studs?

TIA
Shawn
