Subject: Fire hazard? fuel line?

I read some concerns about busses bursting into flame because
of fuel lines getting old and leaky.

Do you have to pull the engine to get to the fuel pump (particularly
on a '69) ((no I have look myself even though I spend a lot of time 
under the bus))

What would have to happen in order to get a fuel line guaranteed
not to ever explode the bus, killing me and my family and everybody 
the the cars around us?  How can I inspect this?
