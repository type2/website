CONGRATULATIONS!!!

&gt; This week I almost gave up hope. On Tuesday I was very close to
&gt; complete. I found the remaining problem.... The big rubber gaskets
&gt; between the runners and head were leaking.

those are real buggers too, BTDT
&gt;
&gt; It was on Tuesday night when I went out to solve that problem that I
&gt; noticed a bigger problem.... The tin that fits between the alternator
&gt; and the #2 piston was sitting on my workbench.

opps, also BTDT
&gt;
&gt; Weber carbs and Solex PDSIT's danced like demonic sugarplums in my head
&gt; all through the night. But there was no

nightmares??!!

&gt; More sleuthing this afternoon found the problem... another vacuum leak
&gt; at the cold start valve.  I pulled it off, put some &quot;Seal-all&quot; under

vacuum leaks are the demon of FI engines.

&gt; When I lit it up, it ran nicely. I adjusted the timing, lowered the
&gt; idle, and took it for a spin.  Woohoo!!!!!
&gt;
&gt; I quickly discovered that late baywindows without power brakes are not
&gt; much fun on test drives if you want to wind out a motor. So I took

LOL,  need an anchor to get em stopped

&gt; easy. The powerband is a bit different, I think that's mostly the
&gt; distributor.

probably, the dizzy is real important to how they run

&gt; Anyway, I have to go fill the tank and take this baby for a longer test
&gt; run. Tomorrow I'm off to cottage country for a Potts' Boys weekend with
&gt; my dad and brothers, that will be the test cruize. Wish me luck. Next

fix that brake booster first!!!

&gt; week the trailer hitch goes back on and we head up to BusFusion on
&gt; Friday night.

wish I were coming, I'm not going anywhere Thur my shifter linkage pulled
loose, managed to get it home in 1st but it has been raining since, can't
find the part new but I'm pretty sure I have a used one from a bus I
scavanged auto tranny parts from a few years ago,  now if I can find the
box I put em in.......

happy trails
Bob
