&gt; where the dizzy goes and said commented on the spring.  Spring?  Sure
&gt; enough, there is a spring in there, centered in the hole, about an inch
&gt; down..  Is that right?  Dont recall that on any other VW I had, but to tell
&gt; the truth I never stuck my finger in there before....

It's supposed to be there!  It keeps the distributor drive against its
shims to keep the timing gears aligned properly.  If it isn't there, the
drive will shift up and down a bit and change the advance, since the gear
is helical
