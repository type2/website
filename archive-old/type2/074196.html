Subject: Re: [T2] Fri--What is it with the dead?


this thread i cannot pass up.
i sent in a letter to (ahem) a certian Hot &amp;&amp;'s magazine about this same 
topic, as they were saying that grateful dead stickers equal more police 
interest on the roads. I came to the vw scene from the dead scene and found 
that i was in a wierd middle ground. first of all, i can say deadheads love 
the busses for the utility they provide. i slept 7 people in my 77 bus and 
drove 14 people to a show in my 71 bus, for the music. you cant do that in a 
cavalier, or even a jetta for that matter. so, i started to feel funny when 
i was bringing my &quot;nearly show quality&quot; bus to dead shows and parking next 
to busses that, due to all physical laws, should not work. there was a 
tremendous amount of Muir knowledge in those dead show parking lots, so i 
saw a lot of funky aberations. for example, an international harvester 
school bus with a splitty top half and a super B top half both welded on the 
top. i actually got to crawl in there and see the sleeping setup, it was 
much live being in a VW submarine. So, the short version of the story is 
that the dead started touring in 1965 and the busses probably seemed ideal 
for the purpose of following the tour. they are a natural fit and all the 
vw/dead bumper stickers help to put the two together in everyone's 
subconscious. i admit i feel a little like a stereotype when i have the dead 
on in my bus and i pull into a rest area. on the other hand, mabye my button 
up shirt and clean shaven face negates the image. one last thought, the last 
dead show i went to in 1995, i got a ride home from a 20 year deadhead, 
several hundred concert veteran, in his LEXUS! So, there is my friday 
morning sermon.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;what is interesting about the greatful dead, and what is their connection
&gt;&gt;to
&gt;&gt;busses?
&gt;
&gt;I can't explain a single other thing about those guys, but this one's easy:
&gt;it was a hippie thing. The Dead had a lot to do with drugs and hippies, and
&gt;buses did have a big part in the hippie movement.
&gt;
&gt;I don't get it, personally. I do love the way it shocks people when they
&gt;pull up alongside a big old &quot;hippie van&quot; which is blaring the Sex Pistols,
&gt;though.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Pardon my pedantry.  I have only come here seeking knowledge; things they
&gt;&gt;would not teach me of in college.
&gt;
&gt;Good quoting job!
