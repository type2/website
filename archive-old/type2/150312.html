Subject: Bench to bucket seat conversion?

I've got a 72 transporter with a 1/3-2/3 split bench seat up front and I'd like to make the switch to two bucket seats.  Has anyone done this?  I don't have the bucket seats to look at so I'm not sure how much modification is necessary.  The only thing I know for sure is my spare tire currently sits under my front passenger seat so that'll have to go.  

Thanks,
--Mitchell
