Subject: Re: [T2] Battery won't charge

I was having some problems with my generator recently. I wasn't holding a
charge, and I thought that it was similar to my Beetle's charge problem; I
cleaned the armature, I pushed the brushes in. It worked on the Beetle ---
the generator on the Bus was worn slap out!!
I ended up replacing the generator (creates a charge that varies with revs)
with an alternator (steady charge), and there's no problem.
First order of business, charge the battery all the way up. More problems?
Replace the voltage regulator. I've had a number of voltage regulator
problems, so I highly recommend Bosch regulators. Another kind, (rhymes with
Torenson) nearly burned up.
