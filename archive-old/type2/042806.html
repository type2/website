Subject: Re: Whats my problem?

Hey Amy,

Congratulations on the purchase of your new bus.

I had a similar problem when I first bought my bus.  It was the result of
the bus having sit for a while, then I drive it a long way which broke up
some of the crud, this crud falls in the carberautor, and then you have
problems such as the bus dying whenever you take your foot off of the
accelerator.

With mine, I just kept driving it and it worked its way through.  If it
continues, you may try using some Gunk Carberautor cleaner.

Until Later,

&gt; I just bought a &quot;new&quot; bus a few weeks ago.  I drove it all the way home
from
&gt; Baltimore, MD to Bloomington, IL.  I don't know much about fixing buses,
this
&gt; is my second one.  Anyways, it seemed to do great all the way home from
&gt; Baltimore.  Got good gas mileage and I was able to actually pass people!
BUT
&gt; of course it decided that it had to have some problems now.  When I drive
it
&gt; in town it can't seem to keep itself alive, its constantly threatening to
die
&gt; on me.  The more I drive it the worse it gets.  When I stop at stop signs,
or
&gt; lights the oil light will start to flicker and then it just dies.  I've
&gt; checked my oil several times, seems to be fine.  Could it be as simple as
its
&gt; idling too low?  The engine seems to get really hot as I've noticed as
well,
&gt; is it overheating part of my problem?   I thought it could possibly be
that
&gt; instead of my heat coming out in the bus that maybe its just blowing back
&gt; into the engine, I really don't know...any help is appreciated, thanks.
