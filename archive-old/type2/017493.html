&gt; The only fix that I am aware of is to replace the regulater. Anyone know
&gt; something I don't?

I have fixed a similar problem with JB Weld (I am assuming the points on
the shaft are worn down).  Just put some on the shaft, in the screw
hole, and in the socket on the crank.  Then assemble and let it dry for
a day or so.  Should last a long time.  If you have a small welder, you
might want to try a buildup of the crank and file it back down, but the
JB weld is worth a try.  (Don't use a cheap imitation, the real JB Weld
is the only thing that works for many applications.)
