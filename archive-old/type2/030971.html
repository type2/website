&gt; &gt;  the &quot;valve seats&quot; have fallen through on my 72. 
&gt; 
&gt; This has happened to me two times in the last two years on my 72.   Why?
Probably because I had some old, high mileage heads rebuilt, all in  the
name of saving a few bucks.  This time (I am currently in the process  of
putting my engine back together) I bought a set of brand new heads.   I

be sure to have the valve seats &quot;Swagged&quot; onto the heads
