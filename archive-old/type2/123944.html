Subject: 1971 Turn Signal Switch

Does anyone know if turn signal switches from other years will work in the
1971 housing.  Not having much luck finding a 1971 unit.  Maybe someone has
put a newer column in there bus to solve this issue?  What to do. . .  I
have seen universal turn signal units that can be mounted on the column but
I would like something that looks better.

Thanks,

Doug
