&gt; only situation where I apply a thread locker is when a fastener has
&gt; previously demonstrated that it will back out under vibration and even
&gt; then I tend to retorque once to be sure that the failure is on the part of
&gt; the fastener not the assembler (me).

Hello OKKIE     How ya doing  well I hope.    Personally I would rather be 
safe than sorry. I tend to use locktite on certain fasteners like case nuts that 
can leak or work loose that you can't get to without removing the engine and 
mostly flywheel bolts , always on the gland nut on the type 1 motors, If you 
have ever seen one come loose you will understand. I remember when I fixed that 
poor girl who was murdered traveling across country a couple of years ago her 
flywheel stayed in the bellhousing when I pulled the motor. She had already 
traveled a couple of thousand miles before that happened. I had to redrill the 
crank and replace the flywheel just to get it back together. Last year I heard 
from the person who ended up with her bus who told me that the flywheel had 
stayed together . Considering it was basically a patch job it probably wouldn't 
have held without locktite. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  salem Import
