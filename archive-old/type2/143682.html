Subject: valves

Hi all,

  I am new to the list and I have a question...  I am
working on my old 1974 bus that has been camped out in
my garage for about a year and a half.  It is running
but not very well.  I decided to go through the tune
up procudure that is in the &quot;how to keep your
volkswagen alive book.&quot;  I have a question about the
valve adjustment. 

  I can find the point of TDC for cylinder #1 witht
the little notch on the pully and alligning it to the
0 degree mark on the scale. The manual says to use
this position to find the clearance of .006&quot; on
cyliner 1 and 3 for both the intake and exhaust
valves.  Then to rotate the pulley 180 degrees from
the notch to do cylinders 2 and 4.  I am having
difficulty knowing weather or not i am exactly 180
from the original mark on the pulley. I don't want to
set .006 at 175 degrees or something.  Any suggestions
on the valve setting?

thanks,

jason antolovich
