Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Pressure dropping to Zero after 15 mnutes warm up
  when I  stop?

My suggestion would be to temporarly replace the electronic sender with 
a mechanical one, and see what the oil pressure really is. Also note 
that the oil light doesn't come on at 0psi, but at a very low psi (i 
think it's 5psi ish). This might help with it. You also might verify 
that the engine is not getting too hot and causing oil breakdown.
