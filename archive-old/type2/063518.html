&gt; hey now,
&gt; 
&gt; okay, i've been told several different things by different folks.
&gt; i'm looking for a winter oil. BUT, here are my winter conditions:
&gt; 
&gt; a) i'm in central nc.
&gt; b) i'd say average winter temp is 35-40 or so.
&gt; c) it ofter gets below freezing...
&gt; d) once in a while 15-25
&gt; e) RARELY it gets below 15.
&gt; 
&gt; i've been told 20w50 is too heavy for this climate. i'm told folks round
&gt; here run this weight all the time. i'm told 10w30 is for colder climates.
&gt; i'm told 10w30 is good for this climate. i'm told 15w40 is a good alternative.
&gt; ack! ack! ack! ack! ack!
&gt; 
&gt; opinions?
&gt; They say that opinions are like a**holes, everyone has one, so here's 
mine.  I suggest using a single weight oil in AC VW engines. 30W in the 
winter, and 40W in the summer. Works for me.

Cheers,

David
