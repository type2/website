hi all, i am having a bit of a problem with a steering box i have just
purchased for my '73 the box seemed identical and it went in fine the pitman
arm fitted but when i tried to replace the locking nut it was to small.All
the local dealers will only help i have a part number for the larger nut.
Does anyone have the part number or size required? desperation is setting in
and the welder may well be coming out
                  thanks in advance phil
