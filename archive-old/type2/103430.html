Subject: Re: [T2] Temp Gauge

I liked my dispstick temp sender. At least I did until a fan belt broke and 
ate it for lunch. Its the easiest of all temp guages although I have heard 
they are not the most accurate. Also it will be you responsibility to notch 
it for oil depth and adjust it for how deep it goes in. Not hard really.
The other options are  they oil plug sender and the oil relief sender, at 
least for ease of installation. Either way you must route a wire back to it 
and in the case of the dipstick, ground it.




&gt;I have recently installed a new VEGE engine to my camper.  I would like to
&gt;fit some sort of Temp gauge just in case of problems.  I have seen a number
&gt;of products on the market such as, a dipstick that reads the Oil temp and 
&gt;an
&gt;Oil temp gauge that has a sender unit to a dial you can mount on the dash 
&gt;or
&gt;a cylinder head temp gauge that can also be mounted on the dash.
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone out there have any advice on what maybe the best product for my
&gt;needs?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
