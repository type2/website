&gt; &gt; If you'll tell me how much you paid for the
&gt; &gt; tires, I'll post it on the tire page.  
&gt; 
&gt; I'll assume this means anyone :)

Yep, your already on the page.  

&gt; I bought a pair of YKS SV-820 tires for the
&gt; rear almost one year ago
&gt; today. These are Korean tires which after 20k
&gt; miles still seem to be
&gt; holding up very nicely. they are 185R14C tires
&gt; with a load range of D
&gt; and a max load of 1875lbs at 65psi. I have been
&gt; very happy with these
&gt; on the lower end of the tire spectrum. I bought
&gt; them for $69 to which
&gt; included mounting &amp; balance. 

Where did you buy them? 

&gt; These tires are what the local post
&gt; office puts on their rural delivery trucks.
&gt; Might be worth asking the
&gt; local post office who whey buy their tires from
&gt; &amp; start there...The
&gt; only thing I don't know is the 8 P.R. located
&gt; after the 185R14C size.

Load Range C or D are an American system.  Not
always found on tires made overseas.  

&gt; I assume this might stand for 8-ply, but not
&gt; for sure. 

Close, it stands for ply RATING.  It is rated the
same as an 8 ply bias tire.
