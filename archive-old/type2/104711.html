Subject: Re: [T2] side marker lens

Funny Guy Chris....

The lens that lasted just 18 months were from the Bus Depot.  BUT IT'S 
NOT THEIR FAULT - did I say that loud enough for everyone?  They sell 
what they got.  Let me know if yours fade - if you ever get around to 
putting them on that is....

&gt; My set is as good as new. They were from Bus Depot about 2 years ago. 
&gt; The bus has sat on the car port (sunny side of the house) since then 
&gt; and still now fade from the lenses.
&gt;
&gt; One of these days I'll take the lenses out of the box and install them 
&gt; on that bus sitting outside...
