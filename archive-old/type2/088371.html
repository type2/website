Subject: Re: [T2] Shifting poll

My $0.02.  In my 1978 2.0 L FI with a 75 trans (and slight linkage problem)

1st  0-10/15 mph  (15 mph when accelerating regularly, 10 with a date so it
doesn't sound like it's going to blow!)
2nd  10/15-25  (workhorse gear.  I love this one)
3rd  25-45  (alway downshift off the freeway around 45)
4th  45-75  (drove 70+ for 8000 miles in 2 weeks)

Air cooled!  Let it spin fast.  There's nothing worse to do to this engine
than to shift TOO early.  REVS REVS REVS!  3000 RPM is good.  It spins the
fan that fast and circulates air.  Underpowered vehicles in my opinion need
to be driven more in their powerband.
