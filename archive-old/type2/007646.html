Alright people
Help me before I break another one.
I am in the process of putting yet another clutch cable on my 68 bus.
It will be my third one in less than a year.
All have broken at the same place. At the front of the bus, right there
where the cable goes into the metal that forms the attachment that the pin
goes through.
All are breaking where the cable meets the metal.
This one hasn't broken all the way yet, but I had to drive the last five
miles to work in second and third, shutting down at each and every stop
light.
Please help. I can't give up on my baby.
Onward thru the fog

PS
Do you think she's pissed cause I'm bringing home an 80 westy Wednesday.
I've promised I'm not going to give her up, just give her a well-deserved
break while I begin doing needed body and engine work.
Thanks

Poor planning on his part, does not constitute an emergency on mine
