hook it up in the bus so you can monitor the general health of your engine

&gt; In the various catalogs, I see electrical and mechanical versions of VDO
&gt; gauges.   How does each of these sense pressure?  Is one more accurate than
&gt; the other?

the mechanical is probably more accurate, but the electrical is many times
easier to install, and is surely good enough for what you want it
for....running an oil line from the rear of the bus to the dash board for
the mechanical is a real PITA
