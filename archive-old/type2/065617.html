Subject: Re: Ball joints, anyone?

Has anyone around here done their ball joints lately? I'm in the process
and have a coupla questions:

1) Where did you get your ball joints, are they German, how much?

  I'm doing my Thing front end but most of this should relate. Things have
  a Thing specific ball joint, mine are German. $35 each.  I'm doing all 4.


2) Did you replace the torsion arm bushings and bearings? If so, where the
flying heck did you find the parts? I've read Bob Hoover's sermon on this,
and he says to use Whitney's urethane bushings. Fine, but my catalog
doesn't list them for a bus. Nor can I find the stock parts anywhere.

  I didn't have to.  See below


2a) If you didn't replace the torsion arm bushings, how does one tell how
good/bad they are? What are the consequences of leaving the old ones in if
I just can't find the part anywhere?

  I took the torsion arms to a VW shop (the guy knows Things ) to have the
  ball joints pressed out and new pressed in.  This is something you will
  have to have a shop do, it takes a multi ton press and sometimes a torch
  to heat the arm to get the ball joint out.  I removed the entire torsion
  tube assembly since I'm derusting and painting under there.  Took the
  tube setup to the guy.  He had examined my torsion arms and said they
  were fine.  He put the arms in the tubes and tried moving them around
  then told me the bushings were fine so I didn't have to replace mine.  If
  I had to I was going for the urethane ( or some teflon ones the shop guy
  had from when he use to race Things off-road)

  He basically was feeling for side play in the torsion arm and that the
  bearings rotated smoothly. I always kept them greased and it paid off.
  Have 160K on that front end.

3) What did you use to pop the lower ball joint off? What do you use to pop
the tie-rod off with?

  I had bought a ball joint removal tool from JCWhitney,  the kind that
  looks like a large clothes pin with a screw in the handle to spread it
  apart.  I used it for the tie rods then the ball joints. It broke after
  the third ball joint.  Took the 4th to the guy and he used a pickle fork
  attachment on an air tool, off in about 3 seconds.  If you are replacing
  them and not worried about the boots on the joints or tierods, I'd use a
  pickle fork on an air tool if you can. I don't think I'd want to use the
  type of pickle fork that you pound with a hammer.
