For my obligatory bus content, I'd like to share with you all what I'm doing to 
my bus this month.  I've finally managed to hack/chisel/grind/strip and 
otherwise remove the 6 bolts and nuts desperately clinging to the old exhaust 
system.  I received my new exhaust from the Bus Depot several weeks ago, and it 
has been sitting there making me feel guilty.  I need to go buy some new nuts 
and bolts and install that puppy.

I also need to plug up the EGR port on this exhaust system.  Any suggestions?  
I have a '78 2L FI that has an EGR warning light on the dash (stays on all the 
time when I put a good bulb in there!) but &quot;seems&quot; to have no corresponding 
piping to connect to exhaust and support EGR.  Does anyone want to enlighten 
me, smack me around, and point me in the correct direction if this is not right?

Now my off-topic question (which I hope doesn't get me booted off the list!)  
My hubby's '91 Cadillac was recently stolen and recovered.  He had only 
liability on it, so all that gorgeous leather interior that was totally 
stripped out of that sucker is not covered by insurance.  Being the cool hubby 
he is, he let me have the car to make an art car for next year's Houston Art 
Car Parade!  Finally, my question:  does anyone know how to start a car that 
has been stolen?  The shielding around the steering column has been stripped 
away on the left side (away from the key), and an inserted key will not turn.  
Any way to start it thru that missing siding, or maybe I should do what they do 
in the movies - yank a bunch of wires out from under the dash, find the wire to 
the starter and a hot wire, and touch them until that baby starts???  Help - 
I'm as bad at wiring as I am at exhaust!

Assistance with muffler EGR and/or Caddy hotwiring is appreciated!!!

Thanks, 

Beth
