Very possibly your problem is ignition switch and not the need of a relay.
Actually, the electrical component behind the key cylinder.  Ron has them.
I had the exact same symptoms, ended up replacing ignition switch.

&gt; ok, i put the relay on there., and it worked at first, it started pretty
&gt; nicely, .but after i got down there and secured it, it didn't work
&gt; anymore! maybe not enough voltage in the relay? i told them i needed a
&gt; generic 30
&gt; watt headlight relay., but i don't think that's what they gave me. he
&gt; looked pretty confused, and grabbed the first thing he saw on the shelf,
&gt; and told me it was the right one.
&gt; i think he jus gave me one without enough watts. any advice? , oh yeah!!
&gt; when it stopped working my idiot lights didn't dim anymore! but then
&gt; when i took it off, they
&gt; dimmed again. it only dims a little when i turn the key.
&gt; my battery is fine. 12 volts on the voltmeter. help!
