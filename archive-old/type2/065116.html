Subject: body panel availability

I'm looking for a left rear corner panel for my '66 23 window bus. I see in
the VW rags, ads for what looks like the very bottom of this panel. What I
need is the entire panel up to the rain gutter. Are these available, or is
my only recourse to obtain it from a bone yard bus?

Is there any advantage or disadvantage to leaving the electrical system 6 volts?

Thanks for any input.
