Subject: Re: [T2] sparks over the gen

Sounds like your ignition wires are shot... Replace and be happy. Make sure 
there aren't any gas leaks.

&gt;when I was adjusting
&gt;the carb I noticed some spark jumping from the 15 terminal of the coil
&gt;(bosch red with external ressistor) to the cable that goes to the dizzy, one
&gt;of the terminals was a little closer (the one that goes to the carb)
