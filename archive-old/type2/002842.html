Subject: Re: [T2] child's cot brackets

What year? 68 to 73 they sit higher on the pillars then 74 to 79.
[that's why 68 to 73 bars are 56 1/4'' and 74/75 are 57 1/4''.....76 to 79 are 2
piece collapsible but 74/75 bars will fit, you just can't store them]


&gt; Could someone give me the measurements for installing the child's cot
&gt; brackets in the A &amp; B pillars? Scott was nice enough to include one in the
&gt; interior he sold me, and I'd like install it in Wendelin for 9-y/o Lauren
&gt; for when we go camping (and temporary storage when she outgrows it).
