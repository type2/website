Subject: Re: [T2] dumb igmotion q

I get so nervous with ya'll sparking in the engine compartment. I've
seen fires start that way.

This item is $13, and there are much cheaper ones out there. I paid $1
for my little one that has a clamp on one end so it will ground on the
block.

This keeps from igniting any oil or gas that's setting on the surface
of the engine. If that spark hits oil or gasoline fumes, you'll
hopefully only get singed eyebrows. But a tester device will lift the
spark away from any engine component that may be contaminated.

Granted, if there are lots of gas fumes, it won't matter how far away
you get, but even without leaks stuff settles around the engine
case/block/heads/manifolds.

BE SAFE!
