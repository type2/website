Subject: Re: [T2] Engine tune up

Hello Guys   This all depends on the type of plug you are using  Some of the 
plugs use to come with a zinc coating on the threads that would bond with the 
heads. some are just steel.  On these I would use the antisieze on the threads 
.  Bosch and NGK I think have a nickel coating and dont bond as bad.  I 
havent seen any reason NOT to use it on any plug and have never in my 25 years of 
professional shop working had a plug seize up due to antiseize   later and have 
fun  Mark Dearing    salem Import Service  Salem Va
