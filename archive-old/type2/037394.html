Subject: Re: VDO tachometer problem

&gt; Maybe some experienced people could help me out here!
&gt; I put in a VDO tachometer and it works.

Not necessarily.  If you are having that much variation in rpm at 60 mph,
and you have a manual transmission, then you have a problem with either the
tachometer or the speedometer.  There's no way that the engine can vary in
rpm that much at a constant speed.  Remember that the engine and
transmission are locked together mechanically (this is called the clutch).
If you are going 60 mph, the engine rpm will always be the same (assuming
you keep the same tires, same gearing in the transmission, etc).  So
therefore your variability is either in the tachometer or the speedometer,
i.e. the tachometer is not reporting the correct rpm all the time or the
speedometer is not reporting the correct speed all the time.

&gt; I got a 74 2L carb.
&gt; The only thing which needs some attention is that the rmp vary a lot when
&gt; driving at a constant speed. If I drive around 60mph the tachometer shows
&gt; around 4000rpm in 4th gear! Is this correct and schould it be like this,
or
&gt; is this too high?

On a '74 that might be normal.  I think the '74 transmission had lower
gearing than the later ones because the '74 originally came with the 1.8L
engine as opposed to the 2.0L.  My '79 2.0L runs close to 3500 rpm at an
indicated 65 mph or so, but I am unsure as to the accuracy of the
speedometer.

&gt; And at this constant speed the variation can be from 3800rmp till
4200rmp..
&gt; I think that's a big variation!

If your Bus is an automatic, then I'd say it's possible.  Remember that an
automatic has no direct mechanical linkage between the engine and
transmission, rather there is a fluid coupling called the torque converter.
So depending on conditions, the engine rpm may fluctuate even though you are
driving at a constant speed.  This is of course assuming the Bus automatic
transmission does not have a lockup torque converter, and I don't think it
does.  Correct me if I'm wrong, auto tranny gurus.
