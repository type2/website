Subject: Fuse box cover
Content-Disposition: inline

I posted this to the list a couple of months ago but unfortunately received no
help at that time.
I'm still trying to locate a cover for the fuse box in a 1971 bus. I had the
offer of a cover for a ten fuse box but mine holds a full dozen.
P-mail me if you have a spare laying around. Thanks,
Tim
