&gt; &gt; Hey Tony  Waste oil heaters are aproved by the EPA    I have one in my shop
&gt; &gt; that I use a whole lot  later  Mark dearing
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Probably not this one...It's circa 1940's and when fired up emits a black
&gt; plume
&gt; from the (unlined) brick chimney... ;-(

Sure would be a nice solution to the waste oil problem, as well as
providing economical heat for shops that collect a lot of waste oil.

I wonder what they do about the &quot;heavy metals&quot; that supposedly make used
oil hazardous waste.  Hate to think that they are going up the stack and
into everyone's lungs.

Of course, most waste oil ends up being burned, but usually in ships far
out to sea.

Hmmm, waste oil heater in a bus...  That'd take the chill off!
