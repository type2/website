My dream is to go to Alaska although that trip will be a long time in the
future, I'm afraid.  I would want to drive across the midwestern states
of the US making a stop in Arizona to see the desert then up to
Colorado to the Grand Canyon.  Yellowstone would be nice, too, but
with Alaska as the destination, we might have to leave that until
another time.  I would, of course, be driving my Westy.  It would be nice
to caravan since I would bring along my 3 daughters and the protection
of &quot;the pack&quot; would make for a safer trip (although after reading some
of the last expeditions of the Vdubbers in this list, it sounds as if it is
hard to get everyone to cooperate on a schedule : )  )

Alas, it seems that the Smoky Mountains will be my biggest excursion
next year.  Our trip to Old Williamsburg, VA, was postponed until the
old Westy is road-worthy and we will head there after visiting the
mountains (and Dollywood? : 0 ).  There are lots of places to go with
the state of Georgia as your starting point.

Hey, Lotus, maybe I'll get to meet you one day!
