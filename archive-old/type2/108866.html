Subject: oil leak

Hello

You cannot always cure a front seal leak by merely replacing the front seal.

The flywheel must have a perfectly smooth rubbing surface where it rubs the
seal. I have seen many flywheels with rust pits and worse: spiral grooves.
The rust pits will act like sandpaper and eat away the seal. The spiral
groove will act like a pump and suck up oil while part of the spiral loop is
inside the case and then spit out the oil when it passes outside the seal.

Did you check your flywheel seal mating surface?

Or,

perhaps your crankshaft endplay is really excessive. The seal cannot stretch
out to hold onto a flywheel that moves in and out excessively

You might also have excessive blow-by ( bad rings bad cylinders) and
excessive inside pressure.

Maybe you have a blown out oil gallery plug.

keep working on it, you will eventually solve the problem

bye
