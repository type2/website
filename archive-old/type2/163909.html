Subject: Re: [T2] Cheap door seals from CIP

&gt; There were a few possible ways to deal with the top corners.
&gt; -stay on the round part and glue
&gt; -cut and bevel the top corners and stay at the edge (best I think)
&gt; -stretch and glue around the top corners (what i did)
&gt;

When I installed a set of these Brazilian door seals, I found that although
my original seals were basically dead, the corner parts were still OK.  Made
of solid rubber, after all.  I was able to cut the corners out of my old
German door seals and reinstall them (with that amazing 3M weatherstrip
adhesive) in the gaps that the Brazilian seals left.  Worked perfectly.
