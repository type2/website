Subject: Re: [T2] Just picked up my new Bus....


&gt;&gt; since I've gotten it. Basically.. long story short, the BUS has a brand
new
&gt;&gt; GEX 1.8 liter engine. The motor has less than 20 miles on it. The BUS
also
&gt;&gt; has a COMPLETELY new paint job... sort of a light blue body, with a white
&gt;&gt; top (from the dew strip gutter thing to the top is white).&gt;&gt;

&gt;Well. GEX has an awful track record. Lots of short cuts and marginal
&gt;parts. Hopefully it will last you some time. If you have the ability you
&gt;might want to tear down the engine and do some pre-emptive work just in
&gt;case there is something fatal lurking.
&gt;The paint thing could be good or bad. New paint is nice but it can be used
&gt;to cover some horrors in the body.


Oh well... that kinda sucks. Either way it shouldn't be too bad. I've
assembled motors myself in the past, and I have a really good machine shop
that I know about nearby as well. They're slow.. but they always get the job
done right.


As for the body... it's actually in SUBSTANTIALLY good condition. I am VERY
impressed with the condition of the body. I knew the guy before I bought the
car. He was a friend of a friend.. and I had seen his Volkswagen Bus for a
while now. He's had it for almost 6 years... but never had it running. The
rust that he had before that was repaired.. was all mostly in the gutter in
the middle drivers side. There's a little rust hole in the cargo area where
it looks like someone pierced the floor with a large screw driver or
something. The support beams and frame underneath look VERY good. There's no
rust on them at all. And the front floor boards and the front valence are
also very good.

I got a whole stack of books with the car.. one of which was called VW
BUSSES Customization, Repair, Restoration, Buyer's Guide.. or something like
that. It has a big grey and cream colored &quot;splittie&quot; hehe I guess on the
front. I'm still learning the terms.. but these books provide a lot of
information. I hastily threw away the &quot;Sport Compact&quot; magazines though.. :)


&gt;&gt; However, I am completely missing the gasket for the rear passenger side
&gt;&gt; window. To make things a little difficult, all four of the big windows
had
&gt;&gt; the vent option. The brackets and metal that the vent window sit in are
&gt;&gt; completely rusted through... definately unrepairable. So that brings me
to
&gt;&gt; my first question...
&gt;
&gt;the rear passenger side should not/would not have had a vent because it
&gt;gets in the way of the sliding door.
&gt;Personally starting from scratch Id replace both rear windows with solid
&gt;one piece ones and probably put sliding windows on the middle 2.


Yeah, you're right. A lot of other people have told me that too.. it makes
sense though! Unfortunately, I do not have the glass that I need.. and down
here in South Florida... I have only seen ONE Volkswagen Bus down here...
and that was before I had any idea that I'd be buying one (looked fairly
complete too!).  For the mean time, I ordered the rear window gasket so I
could at least put that other rear window in. 


&gt;&gt; !-) Does anyone on here have for sale a vent window for the rear drivers
&gt;&gt; side, and the rear passenger side? I have the glass, but I need
everything
&gt;&gt; else... from the gasket to the hardware to the brackets.
&gt;
&gt;For used parts bustedbus_dot_com is a good start. local junkyards if you can
&gt;find a bus in one.

&gt;&gt; The next thing is... I'm trying to replace a lot of the items that look
&gt;&gt; &quot;old&quot;. I want to replace all the chrome on the car... I'm thinking of
&gt;&gt; getting a whole new set of door locks, and the trunk-hatch door handle,
as
&gt;&gt; well as the commando door handle.

&gt;Im not sure what chrome youre talking about. deluxe trim maybe? its
&gt;aluminum. the outer window scrapers come with the trim.(also aluminum)
&gt;The door locks can be rekeyed unless the chrome is real bad then you could
&gt;replace some again bustedbus, junkyards, vwswaps at shows etc...
&gt;I have no idea what a commando door is.



When you say re-keyed... where would I get them rekeyed? Would I need to
take them to a lock smith? I didn't realize you could do this. Since this
e-mail, I went ahead and ordered a set of matching drivers side and
passenger side front door handles with the matching locks. I'd like to get a
set of blanks (they also sell them) and then have the rear hatch and the
sliding (commando door) door re-keyed.





&gt;&gt; I also want to get replacement hub caps as well. I noticed that prices
are
&gt;&gt; VERY reasonable.. much cheaper than they are for purchasing items for my
&gt;&gt; Pontiacs.
&gt;
&gt;Yes they are cheap but you originals are heavier and made better than
&gt;repros and you can get them at swaps for cheap. either really is fine.


Yeah... the thing is, the ones I have now are all rusty. I figured a set of
new ones would at least make the Bus look much nicer. I don't want it to
look like it's spent the past 30 years out in the woods with some hippies.


&gt;&gt; I did find one place on the net.. Wolfsberg West or something... do you
guys
&gt;&gt; know any other stores that might sell parts for busses?
&gt;
&gt;wolfsburg is good also
&gt;oldvolks_dot_com
&gt;busdepot_dot_com
&gt;aircooled_dot_net
&gt;and dont forget local sources.


THANKS FOR THE LINKS!!!




&gt; Also, not sure what exactly is happening.. but I charged the battery and
&gt; hooked it up. The motor doesn't start. Actually.. it doesn't even crank.
The
&gt; headlights and HAZARD lights work. The turn signal lights don't.. and when
I
&gt; turn on the hazards.. there's some guage over to the left with an R  -
1/2
&gt; -  1/1  and the needle jumps. What exactly is that guage? R???
&gt;
&gt; What are some things I can check? The motor is brand new... but I'm
&gt; wondering if it hasn't been hooked up yet.

r 1/2 1/1   is the gas gauge
I think you should start by going through all of the wiring.
you can find a diagram at www.vintagebus_dot_com
follow the link.

good luck
