Howdy,

The rack I bought the other day, the ZVW153114, does not appear to fit a
squareback.  I tried it today on a '70, and the legs are not long enough to
reach into the rain gutter, buy about 2&quot; - do earlier type III's have
shallower roofs?  Or later ones?  Or type IV's?

I'm pretty darn sure this is a VW rack: but for what VW????
