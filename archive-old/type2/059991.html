Subject: FYI welding/soldering gastank

The only way I would weld on a gas tank is to have it steam cleaned first. I
generally pay the $75 bucks and have them do the whole thing. Soldering
is another thing. I have soldered leaks in gas tanks. Use a big iron and
don't
get it hot enough to set gasoline on fire. Test it in a bottle cap before
you
put it to the gas tank.

Messing with gas tanks is inherently dangerous so if you don't know what you
are doing let some one that does do it. If you screw up an engine you are
out
a grand or two if you blow up a gas tank you wife and her new boy friend can
live well on your insurance money.
