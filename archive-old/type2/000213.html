My request for list information about the use of total seal piston rings did
not result in any replies. For those of you who requested any responses I
received, I did some investigation on my own. Brian Drew of Drew's Off Road,
a major VW drag racer, said that total seal piston rings are a necessity if
you are racing but that their benefit would be marginal for a bus street
engine. Mark Dearing of Salem Imports concurs (30 years exp.) and Todd
Roller(22 years exp.) of Auto-Foreign Imports also agrees. The feeling was
that the expense wasn't worth the benefit for everyday driving. I hope this
helps all those inquiring minds that wanted to know. TBear
