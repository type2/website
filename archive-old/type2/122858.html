Subject: engine fire sermon

&gt;The primary culprit is the rubber line that goes from the fuel tank to the
&gt;front tin, and the metal [fuel] line that passes through the front tin.

This quote comes from Bob Hoover, his solution to the problem is V. neat
indeed. If you have the sermons it is called engine fires. Bob uses a
piece of threaded bronze tube  to protect the steel bit of the fuel line
from being cut. I bet that lasts longer than a hot grommet!
