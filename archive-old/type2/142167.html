I ended up getting Nokian Hakkapeliitta CQ tires for my bus last year
- Bus Depot was out of the Vredesteins.  They weren't cheap, but they
were available locally.  They probably ended up being  about the same
price as the Vredesteins from Bus Depot, after the cost of shipping to
Canada.  There was a very noticable difference in traction between the
RA08s (which I did end up getting in from Bus Depot) and the Nokians.

The CQs are actually &quot;van&quot; tires, are available in 185R14 and have a
100/102 load rating.

Here in Saskatchewan, many of the roads in citys and towns rarely get
plowed - we don't actually get that much snow.  The snow does stay for
around for four months without melting, so you don't see pavement on
many roads from November to March.   Snow tires make a huge
difference.  I've got snow tires for all my vehicles, mounted on
separate rims.  My garage is starting to look like a tire shop.
