Subject: Re: [T2] Tach

&gt; I finally installed my tach in the Guac this weekend. I realized that I've
&gt; been taking it REAL easy on the engine.

How long did it take?
Was it difficult?
What kind of tach was it?


This is an addition that I am considering for my bus but my money is a
little tight.  I know not all tachs are created equal but which one
has the best value for the price?  Can I go down to the local
autoparts store and pick one up(provided the tolerances are
acceptable)?

I called the local VWFLAPS I like to goto and they wanted 90 bucks for
one....thats a little more than my budget of around 50 bucks.

I reckon it added at least as much HP as the giant wing 8-)
