&gt; &gt; Does anyone out there have the Type IV engine rebuild
&gt; &gt; video (the one with Jake Raby?) that they would lend
&gt; 
&gt; I have seen the video and it's well worth the money. It's about 3 hours
&gt; long.  The first hours is a quick tear down of an old motor and the next two
&gt; demonstrate the complete rebuild process.

I would like a copy but have lost the address

could someone please post the address and price.  Thanks

Bob
