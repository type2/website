Hi Brad,

Sounds like a fun trip!  I'm up in the Sacramento area and have been
thinking about taking a drive with my '71 along the coast.  This may
just be the kick I need to get everything together.  :)

I had the throttle cable break in the same spot on my '67 beetle just
over 20 years ago.  Snapped at a major intersection in San Francisco on
19th Avenue on my way back to Marin from Palo Alto.  Ugh.  I was on the
inside of 3 lanes and someone was friendly enough to use their
mini-truck to push me through the intersection and to a gas station on
the far corner, which wasn't required so much for the weight of the
vehicle, but because of the traffic pouring around us.  It's the
weirdest feeling when the engine is running and you have no control over
it with the pedal.

-John

Well, our maiden voyage in &quot;Betty Blue&quot; the westy, went off pretty well,
but the trip was short.  Went to Big Sur via Hollister, Monterey, Carmel
by the Coast,  and down the Hwy1 via Big Sur to San Simeon, Cambria then
home via 101 to 198 to 33 (thru Coalinga) to 145 (back to Madera).
There isn't a lot of power on the hills which requires downshifting to
3rd.  For the most part, it holds the speed limit quite well.

Mechanically, everything went smoothly except one little hiccup on the
101 just after dark . . .the throttle cable broke!!!  Of all things!!
First time that's ever happened to me on any car.  The break was right
near the throttle body in the engine compartment.
