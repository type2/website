&gt; There is a receiver style available that will accept a 1 1/4&quot; or a 2&quot; receiver
&gt; ,for any standard size ball, bicycle carrier, or what ever,,  I don't have
&gt; pictures of the bike carriers yet
&gt; You know the type that the tongue is removable with a pin and the bike rack is
&gt; inserted,,,
&gt; 
&gt; they both mount on the Vw the same,, right to the frame, *above* the bumper,,
&gt; you unbolt the bumper, install the hitch and rebolt the bumper and the hitch as
&gt; a sandwich,,
&gt; you do NOT have to modify the bumper at all,
&gt; this is a very strong style of hitch and does not interfere with the muffler
&gt; replacement

Wow!  Wish you'd had these when I got mine from yoyu.  But you gave me
such a sweet deal I have NO room for complaint!  Hm..  Maybe I'll sell
off the one I have and get one of the receiver style.  ;-) 

Slight caveat:  on my california '79 deluxe westy, the muffler is a fat
round puppy that actually protrudes BEYOND the body of the bus in back. 
(Stand with the top of your head on your back hatch and look straight
down.  Does your muffler extend beyond the body?  If so, you might have
to tweak a little.)  and I could have benefited from enlarging the
BUMPER mounting slots a bit.  As it was, I ground off a tad bit of the
front-most (FIF) weld where the tongue meets the hitch, and put a dimple
in my muffler to get it on.  Apparently the muffler is a CA only thing,
others are flat/oval and not a problem.

Thanks again, Jamie!
