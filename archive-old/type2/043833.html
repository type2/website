FWIW: full load/full throttle use is when the vac advance distributor
provides the LEAST amount of spark lead. This is at full load, and the
engine's cylinders are full, providing full compression, full heat, and the
fastest propogation of the flame front, resulting in less ignition lead to
give the piston a push at TDC.

Part throttle cruise is when more ignition advance provides the benefits of
cooler running and MPG increases.

Also, distributors receive ported vacuum from the carb, which is NOT the
same as manifold vacuum. They are slightly different.
