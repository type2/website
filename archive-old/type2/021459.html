Tommy, list:
I have no doubt you could do a nice job without a spray gun.
I have, in my vast collection of collectables, an old Sherwin- Williams product
guide that details painting auto (Circa 1925!). It starts out &quot; the key to a
good finish is a high quality brush&quot;!
I'm sure you could still do such a thing with SOLID color paints (no metallics
or micas).
Slower (higher evaporating point) thinners are what makes paint flow out and
have gloss, however, they also allow the paint to run!
To get the runs and brushmarks out you'd need to block sand it, maybe 400 grit.
And then progressively finer grits and then rubbing compound. To get it hard
enough to sand, you'd need lacquer or to catylize acrylic enamel or possibly
force dry it with heat lamps.
When I finish up the nose on the double cab, maybe I'll try a roller and take
some pics. (Couldn't possibly look worse than it does now!)

&gt; Hi Chris,
&gt;
&gt;     Sounds like a paint job I saw on a horse and buggy  - buggy. A few years
&gt; back, while visiting a place called &quot;old town&quot; in New Mexico, a tourist trap
&gt; where everything was as it was back in the 1800's. There was a blacksmith
&gt; shop, where they were painting the buggy with a brush. I noticed a finished
&gt; buggy in the front for sale ($7500.00, two seater, one horse power, &quot;SYOH&quot;
&gt; supply your own horse). The paint was slick as glass,
