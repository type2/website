Subject: Electric Fuel Pump Relay...it works!
To: jrivers_at_globalserve_dot_net, type2_at_type2_dot_com

Jamie and the List....... it works, by golly, it works.... tried it again, 
and it cranked a bit, the Alternator light stayed on for a while, until it 
got up to speed.... it finally would idle very rough, so hopped out and got 
to the back and twisted the dizzy.... rev'd right up.... put the light on it 
and set it for 10 degrees on the timing scale.... fairly smooth.... but lots 
of smoking.... I had painted the heat exchangers with Bar-B-Que grill 
paint..... so will pull out into the driveway tomorrow and try some more....

big oil leak under the left side....me thinks the valve cover isn't seated 
right.... will adjust before starting again.....

but......Yahooooo, it runs..... big boost to my ego that I got it back 
together mostly correct.... a first engine pull and another engine 
reinstalled in a Type IV....
