Subject: Re: [T2] I AM GOING TO SCREAM!!!!!!! or cry

Since I didn't get the original post I don't have all the details,  
but are teh
recently-installed heads from AVP?  I was dealing with a Bus just  
last week
that had basically no compression on the 1/2 (passenger) side with fresh
AVP heads.  The bump above the top cylinder fin was contacting the
ring around the cylinder bore in the head before the sealing surfaces
made contact.  No headgaskets (sealing rings) were used per the late
factory recommendation to not use them anymore.

Checked the depth and they were flycut too deep relative to Bentley
specs, which resulted in a call to AVP the next day when we were told
that their rebuilt heads are &quot;designed&quot; to be used with gaskets, which
they overnighted at no charge.  Partial teardown to install the gaskets
took teh compression up to 110 on that side, good enough for an
engine that'll need a rebuild in another 20k anyway.

.. all of which could've been avoided with a slip of paper in the boxes
mentioning that headgaskets are needed. :-/
