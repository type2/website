Folks,

Had to go to Sydney again (325 mile round trip) on Saturday to help 
daughter move again. Took large GE washing machine down, found it 
wouldn't fit in hole in compact laundry, brought it home again. 

Got 23.5 mpg (Imperial). 

Had a problem with a sticking throttle. Made the brakes real hot going 
down one winding hill (River Lett Hill for the Aussies who 
know Lithgow area). Adjusted the return spring, no more problems. 

No flat tyres this week. 

Sue (SO) drove part of the way home while I slept on the back seat. She 
likes the power of the 1776. She remembers the powerless 1600 we had in 
our first Kombi back in 1980. She doesn't like the standard seats and 
said she got sore shoulders from the heavy steering.
 
Amazing how much more noise you can hear when the rubber floor mat is rolled 
up ('cos of the washing machine).

Had a good day.
