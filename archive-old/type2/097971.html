Subject: Vanagon Leaking Oil

Hello Everyone--
1980 Vanagon CA model. Just had the 3/4 cylinder head replaced. When I
park backward in my fairly steep driveway, a lot of oil appears to be
leaking from the area of the tin near the 3/4 cylinder head. A
flashlight inspection of the cyl. head gasket reveals it to be intact
and not leaking. I have noticed what appears to be a &quot;variable oil
level&quot; since the head was done. Does this make any sense? When I park
the other way around or on level ground, there does not appear to be
any leakage. I'm wondering: Could the really good compression on 3/4
cylinder be causing me to overfill the oil when I religiously check
it, by somehow causing a variable oil level? Or, is it possible that I
destroyed the main seal by overfilling it in a similar misled yet well
meaning way? Btw--if it is the main seal--does the engine have to come
out? My gratitude and apologies in advance (i have a fever right now
and today is the first day of school, if this message seems
convoluted).
