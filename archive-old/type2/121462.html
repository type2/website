Subject: RE: [T2] Differnt Speedometer question

To all of those asking about the tires, I'm running stock rims with Yokohama
Y356 tires.  185R14. In fact, these are the same rims and tires that I had
installed on my 76 bus and the speedometer is the same one off of it.  The
rims, tires and speedometer were transplanted to my 78 bus.  I have
confirmed my MPH via GPS and I know that it is off.

Thanks,

Ted Kitch
