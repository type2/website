How loose is the throttle shaft? Push it back and forth. If it moves a
little, it's too much wear, as it will leak excess air around the baffle
and lean out the idle ergo no idle.

If the shaft is tight in it's races, it could be a vaccumm leak down line
in which case search the archive for &quot;Vakuum Schlucks&quot; in the subject. How
tight are the manufold nuts?
