Craig:

Check out the URL: http://www.espar_dot_com/index.htm

Eberspächer = Espar in North America.  Their big business these days is
in diesel fired cab heaters, and some marine heaters.  Not cheap.  But
they may have some or all of the parts you're seeking.  Their web site
will lead you to distributors in both USA and Canada.

I've gotten the impression that both JB's in Colorado and Arkady Mirvis
in New Jersey both prefer to deal with the S-W heaters.

Giff
