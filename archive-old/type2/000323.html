It most likely would be the sender. Exact same thing happened to me little
over a year ago. Just recently (last month) there were many posts about this
very situation. and ways to do it WITHOUT dropping the motor. If you can
turn a wrench, read, and above all else have patience you can do this
yourself. You might even find a fellow VW owner willing to help and show you
the ropes. The list is very forgiving and quite willing to help. I'm new to
the list but not the spirit of owning a van. It's a part of the mentality of
owning a type2 - help each other!

If you don't already own them there are two books you should have. A must is
'How To Keep Your Volkswagen Alive For The Complete Idiot' - Muir. The
author finds some degree of humor in even the most aggravating situations.
Even if you decide to have a shop do the work on your van I would highly
recommend this book. The other is the 'Volkswagen Service Manual' - Robert
Bentley, you'll see this referred to a &quot;Bentley's&quot; in the list. Good luck.

79 Transporter, 2.0L EFT - Auto

&gt;hello list,
&gt;i have a 79 automatic FI.  Last week my fuel guage started acting wierd,
&gt;when I get down to about a half tank of gas the guage moves down to way
&gt;past empty (so far past empty you can't see the needle). At first I
&gt;thought I somehow ran out of gas but when I put $5 worth in I had a full
&gt;tank (usually takes about $12 to fill it up). So lately when this
&gt;happens I just take note of the mileage and figure I have at least
&gt;another 50 miles before I'd need to worry about running out of gas
&gt;(probably a lot more than that).  Does this sound like a problem with
&gt;the guage itself or would it be the sender (?) in the fuel tank?
&gt;I feel too inexperienced to be tackling this myself (super-newbie here) but
&gt;would appreciate any advice and knowledge you have to offer.
&gt;thanks alot,
&gt;lisa- 79 bus
&gt;
