Subject: So How do you adjust torsion bars?(was saggy rear)

I also have a saggy rear on my 71 Westy.  Also had one on my old 75 Riviera, and my old 73 Westy.  So, I just came to accept it as &quot;one of those old VW bus things&quot;.  But with the recent thread, I am interested in fixing this.  So do tell, how would one go about adjusting hte rear torsion bars to relieve the saggy rear syndrome??



Peace, John Baker
