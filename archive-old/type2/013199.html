hello list. i just ordered new tires &amp; with all the recent tire threads, i
thought it might be useful info for anyone else looking at tires to list
the prices &amp; availability for the correct type of tires for a bus.

all of this info has just been taken from the TireRack. (no, i dont work
for them...)

Yokohama Y356
C load range = $50 each
D load range = $57 each

Bridgestone 603V
C load range = $63
D load range = $65

Dunlop SPLT5
C load range = $80 each
no D load range avail. for this tire.

i got the Y356 C.  total w/ shipping was $231. not too shabby!

HTH, YMMV, etc.

p.s. - Chris/Tom, the diesel conversion is going fine. just kidding.
