&gt; &gt;I also need to plug up the EGR port on this exhaust system.  Any suggestions?
&gt; 
&gt; The muffler EGR port can be brazed shut, and drilled out later for the original function.

If you must, a clean way to defeat the EGR system is to put
steel block-off plates where the fiber gaskets are used on
the EGR plumbing flanges.  When I was shopping for an new, working
EGR valve, I made a couple of these plates from soup can lids.
(This was a temporary measure until I found a good EGR valve.)
Use a fiber gasket as a template, but only make TWO holes in
the new plate, for the twin mounting bolts.  No special tools reqd.
Gaskets long gone?  Trace the plumbing flange to get the shape.
I put one at the EGR valve and another at the filter/exhaust
flange.  At a glance, everything looks stock and operational.
But, you know better...

The proper way to &quot;plug&quot; :-) the EGR port on the exhaust is to
connect an EGR filter to it.  The way VW intended.  This way
you won't stink up the great outdoors as much, and your engine
will run a little cooler.  FYI, my stock '78 engine has a working
EGR system.

Best of luck,
