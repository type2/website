&gt; &gt; what's the deal with Bentley recommending to leave out the dished
washers on
&gt; &gt; the inside of CV joints??
&gt;
&gt; I have found there is no space for them. On occasion, some people have
&gt; forced them on and they have popped off the lock ring later.

A few years ago I took my shafts and new CV joints to a machinist to have
the CV's pressed on.  The machinist put the dished washers on (I assumed he
knew not to) but I left them in place and never had a hint of trouble.
