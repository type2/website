&gt; &gt;I got a VDO oil pressure dual sender and gauge at the pick-n-pull from
&gt; &gt;an 83 Audi.  Looks just like the brand-new one I bought from Bus Depot.
&gt; &gt;Installed it on my type 1 motor in my 58 single cab and thought, &quot;Cool!
&gt; &gt;Guage and sender for $7&quot;.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Problem is, while the gauge works just fine, the dummy light works in
&gt; &gt;reverse.  It goes off when pressure drops below the threshold level of
&gt; &gt;the sendor, but stays on the rest of the time.
&gt; 
&gt; They apparently used a normally open contact instead of a normally closed.
&gt; Buy a brass tee and install the new one for the pressure guage, use the
&gt; original one for the idiot light ,and make the contact that lights on oil
&gt; pressure power your radio, so if you lose oil pressure while you are
&gt; listening to your Lawrence Welk plays Coolio and the Gang CD, your attention
&gt; will be directed back to the task at hand. =^O

Kyle:
Cool Idea, but I think that sender only grounds with oil pressure and
since the radio (playing Lawrence Welk covers gangsta rap) grounds thru
the case, I think we're going to need a relay to power the radio
directly. Or you could use the sender to power a buzzer similar to the
system used on that &quot;frankenstein of the vaterland&quot; - the waterboxer!
Yes, I know Friday's over in the midwest, but I WAS semi-serious about
the buzzer.
