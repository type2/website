Subject: Points Glazed hard starting 81

I just went through the standard trouble shooting routine for a
non-starting engine on an 81 Westfalia Air Cooled.
After all was tested and I decided to put the timing light on the coil
wire I found the coil to be firing OK.
However the same test on the  #1 spark plug yielded nothing.
I took a look at the points before adjusting them and found them to be
Glazed with a black coating, not burned just glazed over enough to
insulate them.
Strange phenomenon indeed, its the first time I've ever seen it.
I replaced the points and it runs great once more.
If you're experiencing low rpm misfire you may want to include this
visual check in your testing routine.
