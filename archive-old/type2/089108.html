&gt; Replacing lifters in a hydraulic motor is not tricky at all and the case
&gt; does not need to be split.

Replacing worn lifters means there is concern for the cam.
Cam replacement will require the case to be open.
( Replacing lifters can be a tricky business :)

&gt; How can it be determined that a motor is in the middle of its service life?
&gt; a 23 year old motor?  Without checking the rods?  Great advice if in a year
&gt; or so you feel like going back in.bad advice if you don't.

Type 4 bottom ends are very sturdy. If the oil pressure/ temp
is very good, my bet is the rods are safe for a while.
It is (sometimes) appropriate to do a top-end rebuild on a type 4
Of course, a brand new engine is also an excellent idea.

&gt; Pressing valve guides in by any machine shop is risky business.......These
&gt; heads are subject to a lot of heat, and they need to be pressed in by
&gt; someone that does ALOT of them with success.  Someone that has the tools
&gt; necessary to really put them in there good such as thge former Mark Stephens
&gt; or the current Boston Bob that have little guide/seat failure.

Mark Stephens ??? No comment. ( Anybody else :) ?
