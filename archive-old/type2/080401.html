Subject: Does the grim reaper drive a bus?

In the mid 70s, a woman stopped me as i got into my
'66 splittie. She told me her son was recently killed
in a VW bus because they are inherently death machines
and begged me to not drive mine. It was weird in the
extreme.

Several years later, a good friend (who loved to
two-step at red-neck bars) was killed while driving
his splittie. I got a copy of the accident report. A
drunk ran a stop sign at about 50mph and hit him
broadside near the rear. The bus spun a bit and rolled
onto the driver's side. He was thrown partially out
the door and crushed under the roof. (NOT WEARING A
SEATBELT.)

Today, in a snow storm a guy next to me at a red
light, rolled down his window to tell me i was &quot;insane
to drive that thing&quot; in slick weather. I smiled and
said, &quot;Just worry about yourself!&quot; (If I had had time
to think about it, I would have said, &quot;It's not a
Thing, it's a VW Bus, d***head!&quot;) ;-)

I drive hyper-defensively and feel safe in the bus. I
even haul kids in it! I wonder if there's a way to
find accident stats for bus freaks.
