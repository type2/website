Subject: Air Conditioning

I broke down and bought an air conditioner for the bus today.  Got it at
Frys - it's a Quasar (a.k.a Panasonic, Matsushita) 5000 BTU unit.  It's
very small, suitcase style but without a handle on top.  Weighs 42 lbs.
Supposed to draw 5.4 amps at 115V but I measured it at 4.1 on low and 4.3
on high.  That's only about 500 watts but my 600 continuous 1000 surge
inverter wouldn't run it.  I think the startup surge was too much for it.
Cost was $188 before tax - a good deal I thought.

I plugged it in and was a little worried when it took more than 5 minutes
to blow cold air, but it seems to be working fine now.  It's supposed to be
good for a 10x10 room, and since my bus is only about half that, I figured
it would cool it easily.  I set it in the passenger window and cranked it
on.  Outside temp was 102, inside temp 120, and the sun was shining on that
side of the van.  I figured this was about the worst conditions it would
ever encounter.  Unfortunately, it proved to be too much for the little
guy.  Never got below 90 degrees inside.

When the sun dipped down behind the neighbors fence it started to cool a
little better but I had to lock up the house and go watch a movie.  When I
got home at around 11, I tried the air conditioner inside the bus.  I
simply set it on the stove lid so that the back of it pressed up against
the jalousie screen and drew the curtains up to each side.  Cranked the
window wide open of course.  This worked Great!!  Temp at this late hour
was still 95 degrees but within about 20 minutes it was downright cool
inside the bus.  Cool enough to sleep.

One slight problem with the air conditioner is that is has no drain hose.
The instructions don't say anything but I think the water is just supposed
to sit in the bottom of it until it overflows a slot in the side and then
just drip off of the outside of the unit.  The nice thing about setting it
next to the jalousie window is that the end hangs over the sink and the
water runs right into it.  Problem solved if I don't mind blocking access
to the stove when I want to run the air conditioner.  Plus having the A/C
inside means I don't have to worry about having a front window open for
potential breakin.

If anyone is thinking of getting an air conditioner for their bus, do
yourself a favor and don't mess with those large, heavy box style units.
The suitcase ones are much easier to deal with, if a bit underpowered.
