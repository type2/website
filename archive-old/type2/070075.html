Subject: 6V Battery Source?

I hoped to see a response to Ben's recent
inquiry about 6V battery sources, since I 
will be needing one for the '64. 

I've called around the local FLAPS and I get
laughed at (I presume that is because I am asking
for a 6V battery).

Where do you get these things? 

TIA,
