That is a good point.  The first time I replaced a
broken clutch cable it
was dark and I was again underway in 30 minutes. 
Importantly also, the cost
of the cable is only $5.

Not familiar with a VW hydraulic clutch, but years 
of driving LBC's (Little British Cars), with hydraul-
ics have discovered a few tricks for solo bleeding.
I use an adjustable roller extension pole from the
paint supply house to keep pressure on the pedal
whilst I pop under the vehicle and open the bleed-
er valve. Pump the pedal a few times to build the
pressure, then wedge the pole against the pedal
and the seat or whatever will hold it in place...
Works for brakes, too.
