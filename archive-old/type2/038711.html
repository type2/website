Subject: presents?

I bought my husband a VW Bus for a very early Christmas present, and he wants 
to fix it up.  I am looking for suggestions on reasonably priced ways to fix 
it up.  We want to fully restore it.  It's a 1974, with an automatic 
transmission.  My husband is in the military, and he's getting out in two 
years.  In a year, he has to go out to sea for a year, and then he gets out.  
I want to surprise him with it when he comes home.  Suggestions?
