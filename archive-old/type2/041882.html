Subject: Decel valve question

Volks,

The question is...  &quot;What the &lt;euphemism&gt;heck&lt;/euphemism&gt; does the decel
valve do?????&quot;  I am trying to ready my '78 engine and FI system (in the
'73 body) for Virginia emissions inspection (yes, we in VA have it
*tougher* than the CA smog regs!... nothing &quot;ages out&quot;) and I think the
cause of my woes is the decel valve.  The engine is near new on the
rebuild (tho the rebuild was doen by a DPO) and the compressions are 130
on 1&amp;2, 120 on 3&amp;4 (OK, we coulda gotten the shimming closer :-)dwell and
timing are set just so and the advance cureve looks good (by rack of eye)
but the idle speed is truly bizaare!  

At this point I would *love* to hear an exposition on what the decel valve
does and what to look for in a failing one and what the effect of taking
the hoses off, plugging them and reinserting them on the valve will have
(I have to pass visual, so it has to *look* like it is working :-)  
anyone?
