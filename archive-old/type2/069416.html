Wow.  You have a lot of work ahead.  How many hours 
do you thik you'll spend on that 64?
It looks simply beautiful, shiny paint and all.
Does it have a power train?  Electricity alone 
would be an awesome challenge for me.
Did you take the body off and sandblast/paint
the frame?  (I'd really like to see a photo from underneath,
and another from laying on your back looking up at the
&quot;Roof&quot;, and another of the engine compartment ;-)


Are you doing this to sell it?  Or just insane?
