Subject: '82 Westy FS prefer TRADE
Mime-Version: 1.0

I want to sell/trade the '82.  It is a full Westy with 85k original
miles,  I bought from guy who bought from first owner, it never
ran for the guy I bought it from well, because.

This thing has auto tranny, and A/C, that in a 2.5 ton Westy
ended up to the engine eating a seat at about 75k when I bought
it.  I've had another engine it it while I rebuilt top end only as the
bottom looked fine at 75k.  New P/C's balanced to 0.5 gm.
Rebuilt heads, 0.060 shims, head gasket delete per VW.  Runs
about like what you'd think in this van.  Actually the auto isn't bad
at all, depending on where you are, had it in DC for a week over
the summer, it will cruise with low oil temps, at 65 mph all day
long.  Here in WV in the mountains, it simply isn't up to the task,
have to keep it in 2 on the grades a bit too much.  Doesn't get hot,
just is gutless as a 36hp split (no offense.)

Anyway the positives, very nice rust free (and I mean it 85k body.)
Paint thin here and there, my fault from buffing it up, but I mean
this body is clean.  Impeccable interior with all the stuff.  NICE
WORKING BA6 HEATER.  New pump for the sink, and I had the
fridge out and cleaned and overhauled cause it tended to blow out
on the highway.  It will now light instantly and will never blow out
at interstate speeds.  Also installed a nice aux fan inside real
slickly wired so it looks factory, maintains 40F on a 90F day.
Newer Dansk heat exchangers but surface rusty now (will include
the OEM stailess boxes too, flanges thin.)  New parking brake
cables.  And the engine.  Oh curtains, canvas, stove, and all the
other camping stuff perfect, and new seal on poptop.  If I get a fair
deal I might include a solid '87 auto tranny as a spare (not that it
needs it, tranny is solid and quiet, ATF and diff oil changed.)
Bumpers are relatively straight, real neat rear hitch (another reason
the engine died?) that is a bit more HD than the standard class 1.

Negatives, a heavy ole automatic air cooled Westy.  Like I said, in
the flat land (or even the foothills) this is a great van, I can drive it
on the interstate here just fine, but when I hit a 2500 foot mountain
things crawl.  The A/C.  I did not put the belts back on but it has
some freon at least (hisses if you touch a schraeder for a second.)
Takes up the entire rear upper cabinet.  I'd remove it personally, it
is probably the primary reason along with a heavy foot why the first
engine went early (though in my experience 100k is about it for a
2.0 in an air cooled Vanagon.)  The top is pretty dull and discolored.
Curently 2 OK new heavier duty car tires, and two pieces of junk, I'll
put 2 new reinforced Conti's on in place on whichever end you prefer.

Anyway this is a pretty nice van, as a comparison if anyone
remembers Bartniks blue '81? or has seen Dolans '80, this van
is quite a bit nicer than either all round (and no offense meant
to either of those.)  It runs nice, drives nice, and is correct all
round.  I'm asking $5000 obo to sell the thing.  BUT I would much,
much rather prefer to trade it for a late Bus camper of REALISTIC
equal value.  I'd prefer a deluxe '76-'78 but '79 or ''75 would be
near runners up.  '72-'74 would only if impeccable buses.  I want
a stick and would very much like a '78 Champagne camper to
replace the one I raffled a few years back.  Anyway it is a good
trade to a flatlander who wants the admittedly nice gas fridge,
gas heater, and better vanagon layout.  Oh I'll consider a late
Adventurewagen with the teak interior and full top, '77-'79ish
vintage OEV.  I'm looking for perfect body, and perfect interior
Westy or Adventure, mechanicals and engine should be solid
and OEV to mine but don't need be perfect, will take trade and
cash for perfect body with no engine.

I can email extensive pictures after next weekend.
