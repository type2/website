Subject: [T2] still trying.....

well the bus still hasn't started, and i logged 6+ hours tinkering with the 
engine and its electrical components.  i used the fuel injection 
troubleshooting guide in the &quot;library&quot; section on site, and got as far as 
confirming voltage to the fuel pump and all that.  so the pump is getting 
juice.  i also checked the air sensor flap inside and it was moving freely.  
i checked for all the hoses that i could see, but i'm not sure if there are 
some that i can't see hidden in the tin somewhere.  the only ones i see are 
the three hooked up to the decel valve and the couple in the area of the air 
sensor/air box/aux air valve, and the brake booster.  any that i'm missing?  
so i guess the next step is to check the temp sensor, but wouldn't the 
engine run if this was messed up, it would just be rich?  cause she won't 
even try to start.

three things i noticed:  when i stop cranking the engine and return the key 
to &quot;on&quot;, in that second the engine coughs and sputters for a few seconds and 
tries to run.  it won't stay running, and it also won't try to start when 
i'm cranking.
2.  there's a hose coming out of the center of the engine that leads to a 
plastic cannister type thing held to the wall of the van right by the right 
rear tail light.  what is this cannister, and would this hose not being 
hooked up to this thing cause any problems?
3.  shouldn't there be some wires coming off the positive pole of the 
battery besides the big one?  cause on my squareback there's a wire to the 
starter and one to the voltage regulater......on the bus there's two wires 
that were apparently snipped off at some point....

well i hope i'm not being too annoying with all this, i'm just obsessed with 
getting this thing running and you guys always give me good 
advice.....thanks in advance.....

mark. '78 fi bus.
