Subject: BusQuinox Campout, Saturday September 17th - 18th Near
  Hamilton, ONT.

Hi Volks,

I'm passing this along for my good friend Adam. At the moment there  
are at least 8 buses planning to attend. This is the same park that  
is used for the True Canadian Winter Bus Campout, except that it's 7  
months later in the year.



Okay folks,
I went out on a limb and booked the group site at Valens Conservation  
Area.
As Jamie said, this tends to be a busy place, and I wanted to avoid us
getting broken up, so I booked the &quot;ASPEN COVE&quot; group site.
There is a hydro hook-up, but I'm not sure how many, or how big the
hydro supply is. We are right across (according to the map) from the
lake, or some large blue shaded area appearing as a lake.
I dunno, I figure we'll try!

DETAILS:
Saturday September 17th - 18th.
Valens Conservation Area - Hamilton
Reservation is under &quot;Narraway&quot;
Site: Aspen Cove
Cost: $22.50 at the gate. $5 to me to cover the reservation fee.
(The more buses, the lower that $5 gets.)
PLEASE PMAIL ME IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO COME!

Also, I am told this is a non-alcohol friendly park...please respect
that and smoke your crack instead. Or just keep your alcohol well
concealed.

If there is sufficient interest, I may do shirts. Let me know, at
adoom_at_rogers_dot_com

Thanks!
Adam
