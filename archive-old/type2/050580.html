Subject: Dizzy changeout - what factors?

I'm getting kinda tired of the wait for the centrifugal advance on my 
009 to kick in.  I went with a 009 on advice of my mechanic but have 
since heard many comments that it's not good on a bus due to the weight 
of the car.

I have a spare VW 211-905-205Q dizzy that according to Ronnie's page 
(http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/ignition.htm) is from a '71 bus.  Has 
vacuum advance/retard ports and centrifugal advance.

What are the potential downsides of putting this dizzy in a 1600 SINGLE 
port engine?  Massive explosion?  ;-)  Simpleton me assumes I can block 
the retard port ('cause not needed), hook up the advance hose, and tweak 
it in -- yes?  Crazy?  If this dizzy is bad news for me, are there other 
suggestions?

Thanks!
