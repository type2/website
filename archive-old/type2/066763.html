Subject: Bosch plugs and VW end play shims.

All,

I bought some parts yesterday, as i had some time left to go to a
friend who invited me to come to look at his '62 356  8-)  i had
some time left and i fiddled with the parts i'd bought, of
the 8 Bosch W8AC plugs i found that seven (!) of them had metal shavings
on the porselain, it could easily be wiped/blown off, but imagine me
screwing them into an engine without looking...

Also i measured the org. VW endplay shims i bought at my dealer (21.53 DG per 
4, _at_ $1us=1.7 DG) out of the four shims there were two shims 0.01mm thicker 
than the number on them suggested, one 0.02 thicker, and only one (1) was on 
spec (maybe within thou's of mm), i would not have thought VW would do that to 
me. 

All i want to say is, always check what you've checked and then check it some 
more and do a final check and maybe an extra check to make extra sure, but not 
after you've checked it.

Brian.
