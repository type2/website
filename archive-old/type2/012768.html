&gt;I don't own a Bentley and will buy one soon, but meanwhile, I'm
&gt;experienceing some serious leaking. I have one that drips down the oil
&gt;filter, but it appears tight. I'm wondering if it's the filter housing where
&gt;it attaches to the block. The other is more perplexing because I can't
&gt;figure if it's tranny oil or engine oil. It appears to be coming down from
&gt;inside the auto tranny area where it is open at the bottom, and you can see
&gt;the torqueconverter?? spinning around when the engine runs. It is towards
&gt;the engine side of these openings, and drips about once every 3-4 seconds so
&gt;it's pretty bad. Any thoughts on this??

The first is from the filter mount as you surmise OR the oil cooler, if it is
the mount, a new gasket and good cleaning with gasket seal for that mount
will solve your woes.  Should be just doable in the car.  The oil cooler is
another matter, if it is leaking it is a PITA in the car requiring pulling all
the rear tin and the fan shroud.

The second, I'll guess it's red (ATF) doesn't have to be but the converter
seal goes FAR more often than the crank main seal.  The seal is cheap
and is the part RMMW lists for the Type 3 car (they don't list it as for the
bus but it is the same seal and RMMW wants less than BD on this one)
but it of course means pulling the engine.  Often you'll see that one leak
worse on cold mornings and stuff like that.  It is an easy install, once you
pull the engine 8-)  Lift off the converter, pry out old, install new.  By
the book
it wears becasuse a bushing in the converter wears but a new seal solves
the problem for a long time by itself.  You MUST carefully make sure the
pump shaft if pulled out when you remove the converter is fully seated
when putting it back on or risk trashing the auto tranny.  Bentley has
pictures.  Best to get ahold of a Vanagon Bentley to service your auto
trans, it is (nearly) identical, and is not whatsoever identical to the 003
box in the Bus manual.  Even though your drip is on the engine side it is
likely the ATF as it gets spun out of the cooling vanes on the converter
and starts eventually gushing all over kingdom come.  Should be easy
to tell if it is red vs black though.  One should plug the hole in the
converter
with a rubber cork while it is out and hose it down with engine degreaser
and then power wash it off BTW to blow off all the crap the accumulates
in the fins when it gets oil soaked.  This will improve its cooling and
restore
its balance.  In fact you should mask off the input shafts coming out of the
tranny and scrub the whole bellhousing down carefully making sure nothing
gets into the tranny on those shafts or into the converter.  It's a PITA job
though best with kerosene, toothbrush, and lots of rags.
