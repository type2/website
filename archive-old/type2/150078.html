Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Codes. AMC cylinder heads

&gt; What are, if any, the differences between GD and GE series engines. MY

Hydraulic lifters.

&gt; The cylinder heads on my Westy (78 2.0, FI) are marked AMC. I
&gt; understand AMC is a Spanish company who makes good castings, but the
&gt; internals can be of suspect quality.

The importer who buys the bare castings from AMC puts in lower  
quality parts. See:

http://www.gowesty_dot_com/cylinderhead.html

&gt; This engine was completely
&gt; rebuilt and balanced by the PO about 100k ago. A compression test
&gt; ranges from 105 to 125, but there is some oily blow by into the
&gt; crankcase breather and some &quot;chuffing&quot; (not backfire) when the engine
&gt; backs down in gear. I'm thinking that the compression is good but
&gt; there might be some wear on the rings that cause the blowby.  The bus
&gt; runs well and the engine seems strong.

You engine sounds good for 100k miles.

&gt; Would anyone consider removing the heads to check for valve, piston or
&gt; ring wear? Or is there consensus for &quot;it it ain't broke, let the
&gt; sleeping dog lay&quot;

I'm not sure I understand what you mean by chuffing. Typically  
problems that occur during down shifting can be cured by adjusting  
the valves and mixture.
