&gt; Could anyone advise on where to get such bits.......Also could someone
&gt; give me a knee bone connected to thigh bone list for the right hand
&gt; side of the diagram bar the air filter (possibly the use of the parts
&gt; aswell)? I know I am asking a lot .......


Hope I can be of assistance as I have all the correct bits.

When you say everything else is missing you don't mean *everything* do
you?...
The parts that are relevant to the flap are 24, 25, 26 and another hose that
I can't find on any other fiche but connects from 24 to a small spigot on
the idle circuit/balance pipework directly under the air cleaner (#38 on
fiche 016-20).

Part 24 is clipped underneath the intake to the RH carb (12) by part 26 so
you may have missed them.  24 is an air thermostat/valve that is open when
cold.  Vacuum created in the idle circuit (which is connected to the intake
manifolds) sucks on a diaphragm unit (10A) via the thermostat, which causes
the flap inside 5 to pull up, allowing warm air from the #1 cylinder area to
be drawn into the air cleaner.  When the air is warm enough the thermostat
closes so that the flap can no longer be pulled up.  This diverts the supply
of fresh air to the usual air intake hose.  The intake air is thus regulated
to a nice even temperature.

Parts 24 and 25 will undoubtedly be NLA new but you should be able to get
the hoses, though they are a strange size like 4.5mm.  Last time I needed
some I got it from Bus Boys.  Hose 26 is very short and connects between 10A
and 24.  The other hose is maybe a foot long and connects between the other
outlet of 24 and the place under your air cleaner.
