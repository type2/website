   Would I be well advised to go ahead and pull the throttle while I have 
the rest of this apart and make sure it's sealed up as well?

Yes, pull it and clean it of all varnish and deposits.  A ridge of varnish 
on the butterfly or throat can play mayhem with idle air flow. Blow those 
vacuum ports clear. Those are tiny holes at/near the edge of the closed 
butterfly and must be clean for good clean spark advance/retard action. I 
use NAPA Throttle Body Cleaner (very effective on this type deposit) and a 
small brush and scribes and little screwdrivers and get every bit of crud 
out of there. USE A FACE SHIELD. You don't want even the tiniest bit of 
that chemical splashed in your eyes or up your nose, and if you do this 
right, it WILL spit back at you.
