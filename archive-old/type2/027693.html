Hi everybody,

Been waiting for Friday to post this. I drove down rt58 in Plympton or
Carver, Ma, to get to a fishin hole last weekend. There is a house there
with the yard just covered with Busses, and other ACVW's all over the place.
Even a bay single cab (only one I have seen round these parts). I have been
meaning to ask for a long time if this is someone on the list, or if someone
knows the people who live there. The number of vehicles never seem to
decrease, only increase over the years. Are any of these for sale?

Inquiring minds want to know

Jeff
