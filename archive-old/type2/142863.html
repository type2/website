Subject: Got an engine for my 71, lots 'o' questions!

Picked up the engine for my 71. Here's what I got for my $1600 (that I
haven't paid for yet, but he said the engine and stuff was taking up
too much space.. LoL! I'm gonna be in debt for a while I think...)

Brand new 1776 with all new parts, bugpack rockers, full flow oil
pump, deep sump, lightened flywheel, etc. (Ok, not my first choice for
components, but the price was right.)
Brand new pair of Weber 40 IDFs with 2 sets of intake manifolds, one
set drilled and tapped for booster.
Misc gaskets and such.
He also threw in a set of 4 Carrol Shelby alloy snowflake style wheels
for the bus. They're tired, the gold anodizing has flaked off and
there is a bit of curb rash. Nothing structural wrong with them
though. 14x6.5

What I think I need:
Alternator kit (don't want any generators)
Clean up my tinwork.
Starter (I'm going to have the one I have rebuilt).
Linkage for the carbs.
Front pulley. (Can a stock pulley be used with the lightened flywheel
on the other end?)
Better dist (I have an 009... LoL!)
Muffler (I have stock heater boxes.. A few sets in fact)
Oil cooler seals
Clutch kit
Motor and Trans mounts
Tin seals

What am I missing from that list?
