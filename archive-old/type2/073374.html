&gt;I'm upset because the theif used a pry bar to remove the tape
&gt;deck and in the process took chunks out of my dash board.

Same thing happened to my VW Rabbit just a couple of weeks ago, from in
front of my house. they snapped the dashboard and heater control unit in
two, and the stereo was only worth about $25 - my brother picked it up at a
flea market after stereo #4 was stolen from it!

I replaced it with one with a removable faceplate - definitely worth the
extra couple of dollars.

This brings up something i've been thinking about - i live in boston, where
this sort of thing is preactially an annual occurance for me. it never
happened in my Jetta when i had it, and i suspect this is because it had a
flashing red light near the door lock indicating that there was an alarm.
When i get my bus, i'm definitely going to consider installing an alarm.
