Subject: Re: [T2] 75 bus resto-sl. door track cover bolt

The other end of the bolt is visible on the inside of the bus with a countersunk head that looks like a screw with a Philips or Posidrive head.

Good luck

&gt; 
&gt; The arched cover to the sliding door track had 2 phillips screws that
&gt; came out ok, but there is a bolt at the far right behid the the door
&gt; swingout arm that started free turning, so I slotted the cover hole and
&gt; lifted it off the free bolt.  The nut is jammed by dirt or paint and the
&gt; bolt is flapping around.  Any advice before I bisect the bolt with a
&gt; dremyl and it drops into the hole of the body??
