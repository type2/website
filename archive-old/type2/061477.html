Thanks everyone for your help with my previous question.
Here's some background info on my van:
I have owned it since Jan. 97. The PO was the second owner and it had been
rebuilt once. I'm not sure about the details behind that. He did have the
duel carbs changed to a single at that time. Last summer after driving to
the Grand Canyon from Vancouver BC I had to have it rebuilt again. The guy I
took it to had (he said) a '74 engine so I told him to just switch them. The
van  worked fine since then until about two months ago when my regular
mechanic told me I needed new heads. He did a compression test, I don't
remember all the exact numbers but  #1 was 0. All the others were around the
50-85 range. At that point I took it off the road and bought a little beater
for the winter with heat ;) Do really need new heads? What else could be
wrong?
I would like and probably really enjoy doing the work myself but I don't
have the space. Are there any other listees in the Vancouver BC area that
could help?
Thanks again everyone,

Kerry
'74 Westy &quot;Wally&quot;
