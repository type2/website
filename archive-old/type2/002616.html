1) the engine revs slightly when the brakes are applied.  I was thinking
that
&gt; this could possibly be a problem with the brake booster? maybe a bad check
&gt; valve or similar problem in the booster?

Probably check valve.  Test it in the driveway and see if the motor
smokes...then it would mean the booster, possibly.

The rear seal would involve dropping the motor.  I would anticipate
inspecting the clutch,amend more than likely needing to replace it.  If oil
has been leaking there, the clutch is on its last legs.  DO NOT just replace
the disk, replace the pressure plate and throw out bearing, too.

Count on putting a front seal in the transmission at this point, too.

If you are paying someone to pull the motor, get as much for your money as
you can.

&gt; a friend &amp; i went to look at a bus yesterday. its a '73 standard. a couple
of
&gt; questions regarding our initial inspection.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 2) engine main seal: the current owner says that the last time the engine
&gt; was dropped, it was dropped without removing the transmission/engine as
one
&gt; unit.  he thinks the main seal between the engine/tranny may be bad, as it
&gt; has leaked since. however, upon visual inpection yesterday as well as a
&gt; 3 or 4 mile road test yesterday it did not appear to be leaking. being
&gt; as this might be a little advanced for my mechanical ability, i was
wondering
&gt; what would be a 'resonable price' to expect a mechanic to replace this
seal?
&gt;
&gt; overall the bus is pretty solid &amp; my friend &amp; i think we can get it for a
&gt; steal of a price.  we would just like to know a little info about these 2
&gt; particular items before we dive in. if we dont buy it, i will forward the
&gt; info to the list so. apparently the current owner has had it for sale for
&gt; quite sometime &amp; is having trouble getting rid of it.
&gt;
&gt; TIA
