&gt; Why is it people on this list are afraid to drive their buses?  A
&gt; 5,000 mile trip is not that big a deal if your bus is in good shape.

My quarrel is not with the 5,000-mile length but with the fact that it is  
a race, which by definition means pushing your bus engine to the limit,  
something I prefer not to do unless my wife is giving birth on the way to  
the hospital.

I can see this trip, however, as a rally or a carabus, where the idea  
would be not to be competitive but to be cooperative, with the goal that  
all who start finish, and busloads of comraderie and adventure along the  
way.

Cheers,

John R.
