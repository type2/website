Subject: Woodruff key

Well the woodruff key I have in my generator is coming loose.  I don't know
if the new gen I put in is wallowed out where the key goes or I just need a
new one.  Either way I am trying the new  key first.  What size is the
correct one. I went to Lowes today and there were way to many to guess...

Any help out there in T2 land???

Peace brothers and Sisters,
snoopy
