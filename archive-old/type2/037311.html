Subject: Bus Front Seats

bussers!

Our bus is about to get new front seats.  I was wondering if any of you knew 
of some good remakes for the cushion(foam).  I replaced the seats in my bug 
with TMI remakes from Always VW here in Portland but haven't had them in 
long enough to see how they handle in the long run.  It is a 71 camper and 
we want to keep it stock with the low back seats.  Any re-makers of the 
horse hair??

Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!
