Howdy volks!

Just a note to let everyone know the latest updates on the tour are on the
website. Head on over and find out where the tour is now, and see what
participants have had to say so far. And if you're not signed up, there's
still time. In the next one two weeks, the Tour will be making its way south
from VA to FL, so if you're in the middle there somewhere, Get Signed UP!

For those who haven't seen the site, check it out at
