&gt; You can buy kerosene at over $30 per gallon in the form of 8 oz., $1.95

&gt;

Or, you can fill the SOB with 10-15 gallons of gasoline OR kerosene and let it
set for a couple weeks.  Get a friend to help you shake the bus (yes, the
whole bus) back and forth for a few minutes every day or so.

After a week or two, drain the tank immediately after a good hard, long
shaking. Notice how nasty what you drained out is -thats your crud 'in
suspension' and it is now in your drain can and not in your tank.

Dispose of the 'dregs' properly;  either have it recycled, use it as a
slovent, start a big bonfire with it, run it in a less sensetive engine, or do
anything else with it besides letting it drain onto the ground!

Buy 2-3 fuel filters (your current filter is in place before your fuel pump,
right?) and know that when your bus starts bucking and running rough, you're
going to need to stop and change the fuel filter.  You'll probably change one
filter and then be fine.

A Local VW guy says he has been known to drop a few big 'jasper' sized lead
sinkers into the tank and just keep changing filters as the sinkers roll
around and knock all of the crud and rust off the inside of the tank. The
sinkers are lead so will probably eventually dissolve in your gas tank.

Both methods are definitely NON-DM, but hey - so is the Great Stuff i used to
fill the body cavities (not to mention the sound-proofing/insulation) and the
three different brands of tires i'm running on this bus.  The inside of the
bus ain't wet and she sure drives good!

This from a kid who use to run a 20&quot; rear wheel on a 27&quot; 10-speed frame - boy
that thing jumped like a dream...
