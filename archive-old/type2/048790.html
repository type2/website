Subject: Re: [T2] synthetic oil

Our testing has shown that Quaker State FULL (not blend) Synthetic 5-50 is
outstanding. It also drops the oil temps 15 degrees with NO change in head
temps.

Don't believe all the HS you read with some VW guys on how &quot;bad&quot; synthetics
are in aircooled engines.
