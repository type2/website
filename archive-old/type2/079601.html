Subject: bus break in

Lock em' up guys. I try to live pretty mellow and not be a security freak paranoid person about my possessions, but some dorks walked into my open bus last night and stole an old millitary packing crate that I had mounted some cheap speakers in. The big bummer: a lot of my resto stuff that I had been acquiring was being stored in the crate. Say goodbye to my new lighting equipment, a factory console with a clock in it, heater control flaps and I don't even want to remember anymore. Soon it'll all be traded for low grade crank. They left my tool boxes, tool bags, radio and everything obviously worth something. This licks.
