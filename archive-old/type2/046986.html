Hi Alex,

Actually, it's *really* easy if you're replacing the seals and don't want to
save the originals. Just slit them from the outside with a carpet knife, and
then press outwards from inside the vehicle. An assistant would be a good
idea -- they can catch the glass before it hits the ground.

Getting them out without damaging the seals is a bit harder, but that's not
what you said you wanted to do.

Happy trails,

&gt; How hard is it to remove ALL the windows on a 1973 bus?? I want to replace it
&gt; all window seals with new rubber, and new chrome. Is the hardest of all to
&gt; remove the windshield?? How about the rear door glass?
&gt; How good is the reproduction rubber they sell _at_ the Bus Boys or any other
&gt; source??  
&gt; Do I just push from the inside out?? Any &quot;secret&quot; techniques??
