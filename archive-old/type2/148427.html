Subject: Re: [T2] westy light bulbs

Not sure if this info helps ... But in a previous life I was an electrician
and I remember that there was considerable change in wattage and size of
flourescent lamps sometime in the late 80s/early 90s. Might have to do with
improvements in material and/or design. Thus the 8W one may be the proper
replacement for the 5W one. There is probably only one way to find out
whether it works or not. Rule of thumb if they have the same length, they'll
work. At least in Europe length corresponds to wattage (most of the time
..).

Still researching a source.......  I believe it is a T5 but so far the 12&quot;
T5 bulb is 8W, not 5W.
