Subject: New Mr Heater portable buddy says NO inside use.

So I got my new Portable Buddy today, a nice red color body with ceramic
black grill on the face. When I started to read the manual though, whoa!!!!
Something happened, because all of a sudden it is NOT to be used indoors,
and the manual has the big X-out sign over the icon of a truck, tent, and
camper. The unit looks identical to all the others I've seen, but all of a
sudden no indoor use. Lawyers going to town again you think? Now my wife is
worried about it.
