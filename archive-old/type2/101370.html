Subject: Fw: [T2] Sugar 

I mean absolutely no disrespect to Mr. Beck, but this  cracked me up and
made me smile, after a long arduous day!!


&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hi Guys,

Found out today that I have sugar in my urine. I am 41 years old and am
being tested for type II diabetes.

So, what is the general experience on the group with this?

Will it make my swings worse and prolong my time off work or explain them
and shorten it or completely declare me a basket case and put me on LTD for
life??

Alan
 &gt;wrong type II, the Volkswagen Bus is known as the Type 2, this particular
 &gt;list is for folks who own old VW vans.....sorry



&gt;&gt; Not paying attention to where I am posting is a symptom of the illness I
am
 off work from.

 Sorry List

 Alan
