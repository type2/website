Subject: Loose heads?
Date: Thu, 18 Feb 1999 16:28:26 -0500
Message-ID: &lt;19990218212235664.AAA422.299_at_default&gt;

While I'm out doing the hyd valve checking thing on my recent '78, I want
to check the head bolts.  The engine is making the kind of sound my old
beetle made when it's heads were loose.  Is this possible on the T4 without
removing the engine or a lot of tin?  Might anyone have a spec handy before
I use the bently '80 spec?

Thanks, Patrick
