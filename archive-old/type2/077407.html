You should rub it back with 400 dry and then prime it. Then with the primer,
rub it back with 600 wet or 800 wet, if you are doing it a solid colour. If
you are using Acrylic Lacquer paint I would recommend rubbing it back with
600. If you are using Acrylic Enamel (2Pak) paint you should rub it back
with 800. Also, if you were going to do it in a metallic or perlescent you
should rub it back with 1200Wet (superfine) or 1400Wet (mircofine).

If you use 400 you will end up with scratch marks in the final job. They may
not be immediately obvious to everyone, but any spraypainter will be able to
see them easily.

Having said all that, I would recommend that you paint strip the whole thing
(to do this you rough the whole thing up with 36 grade, then strip it panel
by panel). Once it is stripped, wash it down with prepsol, then water and
dry it off. You should then apply two light coats of metal primer. Then you
can apply 3-4 coats of a good enamel primer, put on a guide coat (which is a
dust coat of black paint over it, this allows you to see what you have
rubbed back and what you haven't). Then you can rub the whole thing back
with 600Wet. Apply another guide coat, and rub back again with 800Wet. Now
you're ready to paint. I would strongly recommend painting it with Acrylic
Enamel in a spray booth and baking it. The advantage of the Acrylic Enamel
is that, if the paint is applied properly, there will be no need to buff it.
If you use Acrylic Lacquer you are going to have to buff it for hours to
make it shine. 

Sorry for the really long post, but if you need any other advise, or want to
do it a bit simpler, let me know and I'll let you know what to do.

&gt;Another thing I'd like to do is paint it.  It's the original white and if
&gt;you wipe your finger on it some of the paint comes off on your finger as
&gt;powder.
&gt;
&gt;I've never had to paint a vehicle before.  Does anyone has any advice on
&gt;what's best to do for these old VWs?  I want to strike a balance between
&gt;cost and returning it to it's original lustre.

I repainted mine just this summer... what you'll need most is patience, it 
can be a real pain. I didn't bother sanding it down to bare metal, but you 
want to rough up the smooth finish so that new paint will stick. Do that 
with wet-and-dry sandpaper. Don't quote me on this, because I'm fuzzy with 
numbers, but I went over it three times, first with 110 grain, then 220, 
then 440(?). That should be rough enough to hold paint but smooth enough to 
come out nice and glossy.

Then, the painting itself, which isn't so bad. Paint about like you'd paint 
anything else, spraying smoothyly and evenly. Too little will show through 
to the old paint (only a problem if you change colors, I suppose) and too 
much will run, so you may want to experiment with the spray on a block of 
wood first. And for the love of Pete, mask off your handles and windows and 
so forth /carefully./ I did the bottom half myself and had the top done 
&quot;professionally,&quot; and I use the word loosely. The shop masked horribly, and 
got the top half's white on the door handles, spots on the windows, and even

missed a spot. Professionalism isn't just a string of random noises, it's a 
word, with meaning! Be careful, and your bus'll look like a million bucks.

And, this may be obvious to everybody, but buy the right color paint if 
you're trying to match. My bus is without the paint code, and the shop 
couldn't match it perfectly. Looked pretty bad with '78 Chrome Yellow on the

side panels and the original yellowish on the top.
