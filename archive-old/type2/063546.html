Howdy-do!

        Well, last night (around 6:00) Pete and I finally got around to re-installing the engine in the '69.  Changed the fluid in the trans, cleaned the whole messy engine compartment up, and started final inspection.  We were putting torque to the bolts on the new clutch when something snapped...... A bolt broke off in the flywheel!
        Well, one quick trip to FLAPS later, the easy-outs and drill were in hand.  Only problem was the bolt wasn't even tight in the threads!  Spun it out by hand.    Note: check it first next time.(Wasted money on the Easy-Outs)
        We proceeded to install the motor on the recently purchased and installed $150 used trans from a local junkyard.  Fit nicely, only problem was it's a '71 trans... Hence the new clutch.  Got it all in and bolted down by 8:00 even though we are doing all this with a floor jack rolling on plywood over my wonderfully back-scraping gravel driveway. Light was leaving us, plus the SO was ready to eat, so final assembly has been postponed yet another day.  Oh, well.  I've only driven it one day out of the three weeks I've had it.  What's one more day?

Question:  What's the best grease to use on the CVs? When I go to the FLAPS and ask this question, they give me a puzzled look and hold up a CV boot replacement kit.  I say no, I just want to repack the CVs, they stare at the boot kit and then look back at me.  I honestly think that I live in a world full of idiots (they were all raised on Chevys and Fords, no CVs there).


BTW... I've always used Mobil SAE30 wt oil in my aircooleds with no problems.. I do sometimes switch to 15w40 in winter, as they seem to start easier on only 400cca that my stupid battery puts out.

TIA,

Blake
