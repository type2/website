Subject: an early friday FS post...need the $$!!!!!
Message-ID: &lt;0.b3889f7c.253f18ea_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

located in --Omaha, NE.
1972 westy
--complete w/cot, step stool
--canvas-one small 3&quot; tear, screens perfect
--body super solid, has a bad, old paint job.
--good tires
--super brakes, (done by PO at a national shop..they do stop awesome)
--85,000 original miles
--matching numbers engine/chassis
--all westy interior intact and not damaged
--all glass good including working jalousie windows
--PO did only drive it about 5k in last 13 yrs b4 I got it.

Cons
--PO did not think you had to adjust the valves
--result-bad compression on #3, I drove it till it was pretty shot. 
--motor is pulled and heads are about ready to be put back together.  
--needs normal type 4 rebuild, P/C's, bearings
--will need new rubber on the pop-top and front wind screen.

I paid $800 in early spring of '98.  Drove it till I decided the engine would 
last much longer.  The engine is pulled.  Would like a comparable offer that 
would entail me not losing money.  I AM NEGOTIABLE if you can get it quickly. 
 I NEED the $$ to finance a '60 SC.  Will help you tow/haul, etc., to where 
you need to go (within reason of course).
