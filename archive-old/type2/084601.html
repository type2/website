Subject: Re: [T2] diesel conversion (some questions)


Problems with this that must be overcome.

Spezial oil pan, spezial engine mounts, spezial lower engine cover, spezial 
manifolds and induction parts, spezial exhaust parts, spezial bent lever on 
the injection pump, spezial fuze box with conversion of the harness, 
glowplug circuit to the dash must be installed, transaxle ratios from gas 
engine will not fit very different torque curve of the diesel. That's just 
off the top of my head. There will be other issues, but those are the ones 
that might cause real difficulty in getting to safe and reliable use for a 
reasonable investment of time/money. As an experiment, you could learn much 
in the attempt, but that doesn't necessarily mean you will get the results 
hoped for, ie, saving time/money by using the used motor at hand.

&gt;hello,
&gt;
&gt;im considering trying to swap out my 2.0 Type IV for
&gt;the 1.6 Diesel that is in my rabbit. i remember
&gt;reading an artical once about a guy who put a GTI
&gt;engine in a diesel vanagon with good results. i know
&gt;that a vanagon is already setup for water cooloing
&gt;however i have a variety of ideas of how to work that
&gt;out.
&gt;
&gt;what i am wondering is...
&gt;
&gt;what is HP of the 2.0 Type IV compared to the 1.6
&gt;Diesel? if anyone knows HP of both GREAT but all i'm
&gt;really looking for (from this list) is the HP figure
&gt;for the 2.0 Type IV.(searched archives for this to no
&gt;avail)
&gt;
&gt;also, does anyone know of anyone who has done this
&gt;conversion or something similiar? perhaps a website or
&gt;email address would be helpful.
&gt;
&gt;thanks very much. as always any answers, opinions or
&gt;insights will be GREATLY appreciated!!!! thanks
&gt;again!!!
