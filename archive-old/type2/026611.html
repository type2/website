&gt;After all this talk about valve seats I have come to the
&gt;conclusion that if your head is cool you probably won't drop a seat. 

I've been reading about cams and valves and rocker geometry. Seems to me that a bunch of little things go into making the VW engine run right (not cool; not hot).

In the past I've always invested in gauges that helped me monitor my engine oil temp and pressure. I'm sure I'll do the same for the Type IV engine I'm building now for my '72. I'm also going to pay even more attention to the details. In reading about how tolerances can stack up so quickly, robbing you of 1/2 horsepower here, 2 there, one ominous factor stands out: FRICTION. Wherever my engine is not properly adjusted/balanced, not only will I lose horsepower, but I'll incur friction as well. Friction produces wear *and* heat.

Just some thoughts.
