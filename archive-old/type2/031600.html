this brings up the point, when you buy a can of WD40 or other similar
&quot;stuff&quot; there is usually this little red &quot;straw&quot; taped to the side.  pull
it off, use it once and then it is promptly lost..... anyone know where to
get those things????

used rubber bands on the can but the WD40 eats the rubberbands.
have tried coffee stirring thingies but most won't fit right and leak.

I am sure someone has found a replacement somewhere????
