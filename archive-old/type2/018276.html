Subject: Second pushrod question.
Message-ID: &lt;3753B083.B673F45C_at_informix_dot_com&gt;

Many Thanx to all those who replied to my oil leak question and I was out on bank holiday
Monday installing new pushrod tubes, seals and valve cover gaskets. All was going fine
until I discovered the end of one pushrod (#2 inlet) had started to break up... ARGHH!

Today I find that the thick `n' chunky type in my 1977 2.0L (non hydraulic lifters I
believe) are no longer available and I was hustled out the VW parts place with a set 
of thin, 3/8&quot; chromoly rods that need to be cut to fit. Have I been had? Are these parts 
interchangeable? - obviously as a whole set replacement. Is 37.00 pounds sterling a 
reasonable price?

Assuming they are an OK replacement, what length do I cut them to? Same as I take out
or to a speced length? I only have a Haynes manual with a skimpy supliment on the 2.0L
engine.

Cheers,



Cosmo
