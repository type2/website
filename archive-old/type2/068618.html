&gt; Hello listers,
&gt;    This is my first post requesting mechanical info,, 
&gt;     I am attempting to replace the rear wheel bearing on my '66 Westy
&gt;     I have so far only succeeded in pulling the outer race and then the cage
&gt;with 
&gt;     all the roller bearings out,,, I am left with the inner race stuck on
&gt;the axle,,,
&gt;      I have tried vice grips, various pry bars, etc,  but cannot get it
&gt;off,, I haven't found     
&gt;      a puller that will fit,, does anyone make one?  The picture in the
&gt;Bentley manual  
&gt;      shows VW 241 being used,, I couldn't fine anything like this at our
&gt;local tool 
&gt;       shop.   I have tried heating it with a propane torch but no go.... any
&gt;ideas???
&gt;        TIA    Pink Newell
&gt;

Yup,

They're on there pretty tight.  I took a chisel to mine to get it
off...just whacked it until it split and came off.  Didn't hurt
anything, as long as I stayed with the race and not the axle itself.
When it's off, clean and sand the axle and the next one goes right
on without a problem. (Actually &quot;bangs&quot; on - even strain as ya go)

I was told by an expert that was the way to go on it.  Worked for
me...
