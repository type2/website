Subject: free westy stuff
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have a sink/icebox unit, jump seat &amp; z-bed in &quot;well used&quot; (and I mean that
in the kindest terms) condition all available free to the first person who
picks them up from my house tonight after 7:00 PM.  If they are not picked
up, today, they go in a dumpster &amp; I don't want to see that happen.

Please view them at www.spiritone_dot_com/~djd &amp; if you are still interested,
e-mail for address / directions.  I am in Tigard, Oregon.

These were supposed to be picked up a week ago &amp; the person never showed.
Save these and the landfill from each other!!
