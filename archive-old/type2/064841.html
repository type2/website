&gt;
&gt;&gt;How about if you used no (nitrous oxide) instead of co2?  That THAT would be
&gt;&gt;a party!
&gt;No, THAT would be Guinness!  :-)  Seriously, Guinness is dispensed in bars
&gt;using nitrous oxide, which apparently is what gives it it's unique foamy
&gt;quality.  I haven't tried it, but supposedly the Pub Draught Guinness that
&gt;comes in the big cans has a nitrous oxide canister in each one.

&gt;====================
&gt;
&gt;Very vaugely remembered from a High School Sophomore chem class - whipped
&gt;cream in a can, the kind that squirts out of a nozzle, uses NO for exactly
&gt;that same reason, it foams well!!!
&gt;
&gt;Anybody for a whipped cream fight ???? :-)

Actually, Rick Fabulous e-mailed me a correction:  that Guinness is pumped
with Nitrogen (N, not NO or NO2) instead of nitrous oxide.  As Chemistry
was my WORST subject in college and I one time scored 48 pts. out of a
possible 200 on a 4-answer-per-question multiple choice test (that's 2
points LESS than I should have statistically received had I just GUESSED at
each question), I would tend to defer to Rick (or just about any other
warm-blooded life form) on this debate.  :-) Rick says, in part:
&gt;While carbon dioxide will dissolve
&gt;in beer--providing fizziness, nitrogen will not--it will only push the beer up
&gt;the hose and into your glass.  Stout, like wine, should not be fizzy (wine
&gt;becomes champagne when dispensed with co2), hence the use of nitrogen.

Sorry for the lack of VW content, but since I posted the Guinness message I
figured I should at least post the correction.  Hmm...  Maybe I'll have to
have another pint tonight, just to make SURE Rick's right on this.  Yeah...
THAT'S the ticket...  :-)
