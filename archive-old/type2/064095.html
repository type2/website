Subject: '75 bus with Extended Valve

Thanks, all, for the response on the long valve 
problem.  Well, I got the head off, and the source 
of the problem is a (currently) oversize valve seat 
bore.  The valve seat insert RATTLES in there (it 
is 40 mils over diameter, and 100 mills too deep).  
The base of the bore is paper thin in spots, and in 
places is pushed up into the intake manifold.

Please tell me that this is truly strange, that no 
one has ever seen this before, that we'll probably 
never see it again, and that I should send the head 
to the Museum of the Truly Weird.

Or should I keep around a couple spare heads?
