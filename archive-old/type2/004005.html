How long do these typically last?  I replaced mine two summers ago and I'm
now finding the gauge refuses to go to the fill mark even when filled.  I
hope I don't have to do this every other year. The PO had cut an access
hole - a 20 minute job.

&gt; my 78 is on it's 4th sender and I have never taken the fuel tank out, and
&gt; only once did I have the engine out (for other reasons)
&gt;
&gt; should have picked the collective wisdom of this group first.
&gt;
&gt; they have saved me many hours of trial and error
