Subject: Re: [T2] how do I test my fuel pump?

&gt;Is there an easy and safe way to test my fuel pump?  I've got a fuel 
&gt;injected 77 westy.

With the pump running unrestricted (no PR), 1.5-2L/min is the minimum output. When I tested my pump, it did 2-2.25L/min. 

With the pressure regulator (PR) attached, there should be at least 1L/min coming out of the PR when the injectors are not firing. This is naturally hard to test when the fuel tank is not empty but it's easy to do on the bench. 

&gt;Is it possible that the fuel pump died because of the bad gas? 

I don't think so unless the gas turned to sludge.
