Subject: 76 transporter hydraulic lifters?

--Cha,

new mechanic time.

solid valves on a stock 76. hydrualics on 78-79.
you must adjust your valves to .006&quot; every 3000 miles.
What is your engine code? (ie: ge, gd, etc...)

timing 7.5 before top dead center on 76.

just hook the timing gut +/- to the battery. then you can make no error.

Got Bentley?

Billy

&gt;i am puzzeled i have heard so much....
&gt;does a 76 transporter have hydraulic lifters on it..
&gt;this engine specifically has a 2ltr enigne and was transformed into a carb from fuel injection..
&gt;
&gt;i called a mechanic today and he says that the 76 has hydraulic lifters..
&gt;any thoughts on this anyone?
&gt;
&gt;says to also set the notch on the fan housing to the o on the timeing scale also and that is TDC....
&gt;
&gt;says to hook the timing gun(strob) to #1 SPARK PLUG WIRE 
&gt;says to then hook the red clip for the gun to the left hand bottom side of the ignition coil and then says to hook the negative to the enigne.... or something that it can be grounded to..
