Subject: Shifting problem

Hi all,

I hope this question doesn't sound too stupid. I just got my '74 back
from the shop. Before it went in, it was difficult to put it into
reverse. Now, they replaced the bushing and it goes in nicely.
However.....after pulling it out of reverse, it is then very difficult
to get it into any other gear! I am being VERY patient as I don't want
to injure my tranny. I'm wondering if this will work out in time or if I
should take it back to the shop.
Any advice will be greatly appreciated.

Tina
