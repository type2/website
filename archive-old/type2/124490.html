Subject: Re: [T2] No new Type II

Maybe it's just me, but I get sorta sick of ACVW drivers complaining that
VWof A doesn't market to us. Hello!! We're the cheapest bastards I know of
(Not that there's anything wrong with that).  ;)

There was a thread just the other day that $250 was to much for a muffler.
That's not even one months payment for a New Beetle (tm?).

There, I'm done. To those who disagree I've just emptied my inbox...bring it
on. :)

Bus Content:  A while back there was a thread on heaters. Someone mentioned
using HVAC tubing instead of PVC. Has anyone actually done this or was it a
brainstorm??

Thanks
