&gt; I would be quite skeptical of the need for a new engine.  Did you see where

&gt; the front main seal (a $5 part)...

would have to agree

&gt; And fyi, $2400 is a helluva lot of money for a new engine and install.

&gt; I'll wait to hear from some of the other late bus owners (I've got a 71 with
&gt; a different engine, that has much cheaper parts) to see about that estimate,
&gt; but it sounds pretty steep.

have a 78 and had the long block rebuilt locally by a shop I trust, with
me watching, including Mahale P&amp;C new cam, new valves new oil pump, new
bearings, 1 gr balance etc etc etc, and it was just under $2,000 and I am
sure they are not going to do some of the extra cost things I had done
like a 3 face grind on the valves, peened seats and the 1gr balance which
costs

&gt; Give us some more info, but don't run out and buy that new engine yet.

AND DO NOT BUY ONE FROM GEX
