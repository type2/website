&gt;
&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; If my bus were fuel injected,
&gt; and had a Schrader valve in the fuel line,
&gt; could I check its pressure with, say, a
&gt; tire pressure gauge?
&gt; I have found fuel pressure gauges for no
&gt; cheaper than $75.00.
&gt; Do any flaps rent these things?

Sears has a fuel pressure gauge for $40.  After
I bought that, I ran across the same one at FLAPS
for a few dollars cheaper.  I didn't really want
to spend that much but what's done is done and
next time I need one I'll have it.

Go to www.partsamerica_dot_com and search for part number
CP7818, that's the some one that Sears carries.

Rob
