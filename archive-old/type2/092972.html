Subject: Re: [T2] cool and fragrant


&gt;a friend recommended placing a homemade .005 paper shim between the crank
&gt;and the flywheel, and make up the difference with the three metal shims.
&gt;this is due to the slag humps up on the front end of the crank.

Wouldn't the paper dissolve with the oil and heat? At least get squeezed out?

&gt;the
&gt;flywheel has equal divits - as if metal was pulled away from the flywheel
&gt;in some kinda stuck-then-separated metal mess fusion. i wish i'd noticed
&gt;that while the crank was out. any thoughts on this effort? can we get a
&gt;judgement on this?  i tried chunking the slag off with a putty knife to no
&gt;avail. i'm apprehensive about taking a grinding tool to it, but can be
&gt;persuaded if that's the correct route to take. chisel? all notions deeply,
&gt;truly, madly appreciated.  - steve

File them down. A good file, slightly oiled, works wonders quickly. File on 
one motion (away from you) only as dragging it on the metal as you pull it 
back will only dull it.

I would strongly advise you to visit a machine shop and see what they 
think. Almost sounds like flywheel damage b/c it was not tight and came 
off. Did this happen while in your care?
