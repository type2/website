Subject: RE: [T2] Seats from Vanagon in Late Bay

I have '78 &quot;westfakia&quot; with '82 vanagon seats...

I LOVE THEM!!!!!

My bus was originally a &quot;deluxe&quot; so I have them there &quot;air channels&quot; on my
doors, so I had to remove the &quot;out side&quot; arm rest on each side...

I just got a &quot;spinner&quot; a little while ago, for the passenger seat, not
installed yet

As far as mods to get them to fit....
uhhh grease....
and a beer... bus work always goes better with a beer...

latter

Anyone have experience putting vanagon (or any other) seats with armrests in
their late bay?
