&gt; &gt;Okay all you keepers of arcane Type2 knowledge. Here's one for 'ya: Why is
&gt; it
&gt; that the engineers of our little beasties saw fit to install a completly
&gt; functional ashtry, and a 12v. acc. socket, yet no FREAKING cig. lighter. I'm
&gt; &gt;on my fourth and last Westy (' 78, and this one they're gonna have to burry
&gt; me in before I sell her) and not one of them had a flipping lighter. (Not
&gt; that its a difficult install, takes all of 15 min.) The Vanagons got factory

As I recall, there was a ligher that fit the factory &quot;power outlet&quot;.  It
was pretty obscure and probably a dealer install from dealers who knew
what part to order.

It's interesting to note that cigarette lighter sockets are getting more
numerous even as ash trays are going the way of the dodo.  Lots of
electronic devices to plug in!  Too bad that they can't standardize on
something smaller and less clunky, like the original VW outlet!

George Lyle, 
who just wired his bus with a 30A circuit for his Ham radios.  And no, a
cigarette lighter won't provide that kind of current!
