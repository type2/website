It's a standard metric thread - M6 I think.  Probably fine thread.  Not
sure, but any decent hardware store should have one that will work, at
least temporarily.  Buy one of each size and use the one that fits.  I
found one that worked in a box of bolts I had lying around.  I also
remember someone on this list saying that the bolts that hold the rear
bumper to the bumper bracket are the same thread.
