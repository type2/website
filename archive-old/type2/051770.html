Subject: [T2] Need '78 Champagne Ed. Interior Part

Hey Everyone,

I'm looking for the footpanel that attached to the supports of the backseat 
of the bus (It just clipped on as I remember).  I have a '78 champagne 
edition regular 7 seater.

I know this is a rare part, but I'd love to find it.

Thanks much,

Arvid
