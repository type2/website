You overlooked the most important thing though...

AIR DOWN!  40-44 psi and you'll sink like a stone.  15-20 psi and you'll
probably get through it.  And realize that &quot;speed up&quot; probably means 20-25 mph
not 65-70 mph.

For a real challenge, try the desert mud at the bottom of a 'dry' wash.

&gt; The best way to drive on loose sand is:
&gt;     1)  Avoid it
&gt;     2)  If you can spot it ahead of time and have no alternate path, Use 2nd
&gt; gear
&gt;         and get speed up before you hit the sand.
&gt;         No sharp turns, uphill is hopeless
&gt;     3)  Carry a shovel, carpet remnants about one foot by three to four feet
&gt; long,
&gt;         extra water (to drink).
&gt; If you drive in sand, eventually you will get stuck. Be prepared. Tow
&gt; services usually won't go off pavement. If they do, they charge huge extra
&gt; fees.
&gt; If you start to bog down, get your foot off the accelerator. If you don't,
&gt; you just dig a deeper hole.
&gt;
&gt; This information is a result of 30 years of off-road vehicle operation. Four
&gt; wheel drive just means you get stuck worse and in more inaccessible places.
&gt; It is fun though, and like keeping our buses running, builds confidence.
