  gaskets?

Hey Noky,

You said that you couldn't find a throttle body
gasket. The Bus Depot sells them. Just enter the key
word throttle body gasket and It will come up or enter
part # C025 133 073. It costs $2.49. I just thought I
would relay this info incase you find that you have a
leak around your old one. Good luck!

From Wilmington, NC 

I removed the throttle body
&gt; and examined it.  Unable
&gt; to find a new gasket, I Permatexed the throttle body
&gt; with the old gasket
&gt; (which actually seemed to be in good shape) back on.
