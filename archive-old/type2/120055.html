Subject: Re: Newbie w/ Q about brake servo vacuum line

Yep, the picture is your vacuum booster check valve.
The wierd thingy on the left side of the fan housing
is the air supply for the left heat exchanger. It
looks different because it has been modified to clear
the ac compressor that used to be there.
