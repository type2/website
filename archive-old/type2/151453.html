Subject: Re: [T2] Instruments for testing an engine in the shop?

Dave, I know you saw this on the VVW list Dave but I'll repeat myself here
for others (with additions).

&amp;gt; Gerald,
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt;  Especially the part about the gauge must be level?

Yes. I have the guages temp mounted in their cardboard packaging on top of
the dash. I have the CHT wedged firmly so it stays at 90 deg vertical
orientation.

I'll probably go with the Dakota digital at some point. Living in SE Texas
I want something with cold junction compensation.

&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Alternatives...
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; http://www.autospeed_dot_com/shop/category_579/browse.html
&amp;gt; see &amp;quot;High Range Adjustable Temperature Switch with LCD&amp;quot;

That's pretty cool. And not priced too high. But for use on a carbeurated
vehicle? Nahh. Guess I could set the switch points to turn on idiot lights
at certain temps though.

But, what I plan to do when I want to go from just &amp;quot;a bus that runs&amp;quot; to
&amp;quot;something a bit more custom&amp;quot; is to sink the $$$ into one of the small
aircraft LCD panels with 4 CHT and 4 EGT readouts (plus air speed and
altitude of course :-D ).

&amp;gt; You might also pull the gauges you have and calibrate them in the oven and 
&amp;gt; boiling water.

And this is partly why i want the mechanical &amp;quot;shop guages&amp;quot;. I do *NOT* want
these guages for real time driving measurements so the fact that they can't
be read from the cab doesn't matter. I don't want a &amp;quot;remote mount&amp;quot;
mechanical oil pressure guage with all the tubes and other potentially
messy connections so the 5 foot limitation doesn't matter. I want one that
I can unscrew the VDO sender and screw in the mechanical guage. It can lie
right there on top of the tin like the VDO sender does now. I just want to
use it to get pressure readings at various rpm in the shop and maybe with
an assistant sticking his head in through the top engine hatch ('73 bus)
while making circles in the parking lot for light load conditions.

Same with the fuel pressure guage. I don't have any sputtering at any speed
so I don't suspect that I'm ever sucking the bowls dry. I just want to
verify that the fuel pump is providing pressure within spec. Then the guage
goes back on the shelf.

See my previous message as to why I'm a bit worried about the readings
provided my electrical guages. I just want to verify them and get a
baseline on the motor using guages that are ALWAYS more trustworthy than
even an electrical guage hooked up within 3 feet of its own sender.

Here's the part about my CHT and oil pressure quoted from my message to the
VVW list.

I have a 0-80 psi VDO oil pressure guage. It pegs at 80 on startup --
expected so, OK. After 5 to 10 minutes of driving it STILL pegs at 80 if I
go over 60mph in 4th. It hovers around 70psi at 55 - 60 mph. This engine is
a type4 built by Jake Raby that sat in a crate (overfilled with oil and
rotated by hand every few months) for almost 2 years before being installed
and fired up. Do I have a relief valve stuck? Which one would cause high
pressure to show at the stock pressure sensor location? Is it just the VDO
guage reading ~10psi too high? Is high pressure at the stock sensor
location going to blow my oil cooler seams? How high is &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot;?

AND

I want the IR thermometer to do just as you say. Confirm that the CHT is
giving faulty readings. If the CHT is reading 350 then an IR thermometer
shot at the head near the plug it is attached to should be somewhere in
that vicinity. I'm probably going to dump the VDO CHT and go with the
digital available from Dakota and get enough thermocouple to run pure
thermocouple from the plug to the guage. The Dakota uses cold junction
compensation where the VDO is precalibrated for a 70 deg cold junction
temp. I live in SE Texas where outside temps can range from a little below
0 F to up around 110 F. Right now the weather is HOT, in the 80s and 90s,
so my CHT should be reading low, not high.

Right now my CHT starts at 150 with the engine cold (the guage has 100 as
the lowest reading). After a few minutes of warmup it is at 350 or higher.
After a 10 minute drive at 55 it can show as high as 450 and has approached
500. Either something is BADLY wrong with my engine or the CHT is flat out
wrong.

Bahh -- here's a repeat of the &amp;quot;electrical problems&amp;quot; part too:

The electricals in this bus were hosed when I got it. I did a clean up
under the dash (which included replacing the fuses with DC breakers) but
haven't gone through the rest of the system. I still frequently have to
turn the (aftermarket cheapie) ignition switch several times to get the bus
started. I get CLICK CLICK CLICK TURN. This leads me to believe that
somehwere between the dash and battery I may have some bad wire or corroded
connections that may cause voltage fluctuations. Even though the wire from
the senders to the guages is new a voltage drop/spike elsewhere in the 12V
system may cause funky readings. 

I'm mapping out a new wiring harness that will run outside the frame in a
thickwall PVC or galvanized pipe housing. It will provide a solid + and -
buss to the front of the bus using heavy cable and will replace every other
stock wire in the bus with new. It's a project I will be able to do while
the bus is in use. I did this for our pilot training 23' cigar boats
(parachute/parasail training) when I was in the Navy because we couldn't
take them out of service for a badly needed rewire. I got one built and we
laid it in the boat and switched out the new wires a few at a time at night
and tested as we went. Then we pulled the old wires out of the in-hull
channels as a bundle. It worked very well with no downtime so we set up a
production line and built 5 more identical harnesses already in the pipe
and ready to mount. We had 4 boats and kept a spare with all new wire ready
to go for each boat (don't ask, sailors are ingenious when finding ways to
damage equipment one has tried to protect in every manner possible). No
more wiring with 6 splices just to keep the boat running. If something got
broken/burned/cut/whatever we could replace an entire wiring harness in
about 30 minutes with three people working on it.


Thanks,
