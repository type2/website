Subject: parts cleaning tank recommendations?

Has anyone seen any good deals recently on a parts cleaning tank? I would
prefer the recirculating type with a spraying wand. Purchasing online would be
ok if available. Also what kind of solvents are some of the list members using
and how is it disposed of?

Thanks,
Bill Moon
