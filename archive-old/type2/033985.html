&gt; Anyone have any experience with Big O tires? They are manufactured by
&gt; Goodyear, FWIW.

Like most &quot;house brand&quot; tires, they are manufactured by the lowest
bidder.  This month it might be Goodyear, next month might be Hercules.

Big O stores are franchises, so the service depends upon the particular
owner.  I've seen good and bad.

I doubt that Big-O would carry house-brand tires in 185R14 load range C
or D.  They'll probably try to switch you to 195/75R14s.
