Subject: Re: [T2] BN4 on eBay



Folks, ebay auctions are not permitted on the list, whether they are yours
or someone else's.  As the charter says:  &quot;If listees want to know what is
on Ebay they will go there.&quot;  There have been a number of these posted
lately and private warnings have been sent to the posters, but it might be
a good idea for everyone to review the list charter.
