Subject: RE:  Engine movement

&gt;didn't bother bolting the transmission back up.  Therefore my bus
&gt;(1972) engine was only supported by the one bracket near the back.
&gt;As can be imagined, my engine rocked quite  bit, which I was
&gt;concerned about.  However, after getting everything put back together,
&gt;correctly, my engine doesn't rock at all, I'm wondering if it's

Excellent move bolting it back together the way it is supposed to be.  The
bus motor mounts (the big rubber ones that attach the engine to the mounting
bar at the rear of the bus) are very soft and were never intended as primary
supports.  With the transmission bolted to the rear (front is front) mount
and the engine secured to the transmission there should be very little
movement allowed.
