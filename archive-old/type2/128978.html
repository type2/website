Subject: Re: [T2] cold start/thermo time debug

Hey Pete,
Unhook the tube that goes to the aux air valve and blow through it (when 
cold).  If you can't blow through it, then the valve is either stuck or 
broken.  You can try pulling it out and cleaning it with some cleaning 
spray.  Otherwise you're gonna have to replace it.

When and if you take it out, you should be able to see through it (when 
cold).  There is a lever that swings open (not all the way), but enough 
to let air through.  I stick mine in the freezer to make it open all the 
way.  Apply 12 volts and it should close all the way in about 5 minutes.

You can also adjust the opening by loosening that nut on the unit and 
sliding it one way or the other.  You can try sticking a screw driver in 
there and moving the plate to the side if it's just frozen stuck to free 
it up.

&gt; Hey list...
&gt;   I've been dealing with this problem for quite awhile.  To start my
&gt; 2.0L FI, I have to give it gas and keep the engine revving or it will
&gt; die.  I have to do this the first time I start the bus for 2-5 minutes,
&gt; starting around 2500 - 3000 rpms until it will idle.  Once the engine
&gt; is warm, this problem goes away.  Sounds like either the cold start
&gt; valve or thermo-time switch to me.  Anyone agree with me or have some
&gt; other insight.  Can't afford to blindly replace those parts or pay to
&gt; have the problem diagnosed and fixed.
