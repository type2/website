Subject: Re: [T2] VIN numbers - what do they mean

John,

Dave Horrigan and westydriver already covered the VIN decoding, but...

&gt; That number is on the metal strip on the dash - so that would be the
&gt; same as the number behind the passenger sear right? And I suppose that
&gt; number would be in the engine compartment right?

The sequnce number is repeated on the M-code plate.  The complete VIN is
imprinted on the steel to the left of the engine compartment in the rear.
If all the VINs do not match.... run away!!!

&gt; The bus is - I think a deluxe - it has a type 4 motor - I only see one
&gt; carb in the engine compartment -

The type4 motor is correct.  It was originally a 1700cc motor, but that is
not the original carb.  The '72s came with dual carbs.

&gt; I'd really like to know the year and the seller doesn't know -

Your question scares me a bit... doesn't the title say what year?  *Is*
there a title???  Unless you are buying it to part it, buying it without a
title involves an extra level of &quot;PITA&quot;.

&gt; I really wanted a bay with a type 1 engine but the body of this is
&gt; just too nice to pass up - and it comes with loads of westy stuff.

A straight, rust-free body counts for a lot!  The westy stuff is all added
later, tho as a westy would have had a VIN starting 232.

&gt; Is the engine compartment in all bay window buses the same size?

Yes and no... they are all the same cube, but the cutout for the engine on
72-79 buses is very different from the cutout for the engine on '68-71
buses.  In Europe, buses came with T1 engines all the way to the end, but
there are differences... just how many I am finding out as Pat Flynn and i
install a beetle motor in his '75 DC

&gt; it is sooo easy with early buses.

After ?63?, yes, but before that, when VW was just using a sequence number
VIN, it was vital to have the list of what bus was made in what year...
not better or worse, but different.
