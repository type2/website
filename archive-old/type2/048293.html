&gt; 2) in the past my windshield reservoir could be pumped with 43 ponds of
&gt; air. recently, anything over 15 pounds causes the steering column to weep
&gt; water. seems odd, and not urgent, but i was wondering if anybody had that
&gt; wierdness?

&lt;snip&gt;

Sounds like your hoses that go from the reservoir to the switch on the
column have started to rot, I would tell you how to replace them but I have
been putting off doing mine for the last year or so.
Hope this helps.
