External distributor timing adjusters were standard equipment on most, if
not all, makes and models for many decades.  It was only with the advent of
[relatively] high speed and high compression engines that the manufacturers
phased out this very useful feature.

The adjusters rarely required any tools to change the setting, so you could
easily fine tune the ignition timing throughout the course of a journey as
changing road and fuel conditions warranted.

I have a vague memory of such a mechanism fitted to very early Beetles, but
it may have been an &quot;accessory&quot; fitted by a dealer.

&gt;&gt;  Most came with a vernier type adjustment screw to externally
adjust the distributor to its ping point as specified in the Owner's
manual as part of a regular tune up.  &lt;&lt;
