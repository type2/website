imho of course! 15&quot; and drivability do not relate! the kreeper came with a
15&quot; grant and as long as i was going straight, it was cool-not as cool as my
near perfect original mind you- if i had to park or turn around, my muscles
popped like a body builder! final analysis and recommendation? dont do it!
unless you really feel like you need to-then by all means go ahead! :-)

&gt;The second thing is how is the drivability of one of these? From
&gt; what I understand, the wheel is about 15&quot; across. I've always found that
my
&gt; oversize factory wheel is a good deal of overkill but it would be nice to
hear
&gt; from someone who has actually done it. &gt; Thanks,
