&gt; &gt;unauthorized people.  Has anyone installed a kill switch that could lend 
&gt; &gt;some advice?

yup, put it where it won't be found or is igcognito,, and don't tell
anyone where it is!!!!

or even better get a power switch that has to be held down for the starter
to operate.

I ain't telling
