Subject: Re[2]: 1962 Westy Hatch Sunroof

     
     The hatch is about 2x3 feet and located above the floor space inside 
     of the side doors.  The hatch seal is not in very good shape from what 
     I could see but it doesn't seem to leak.  The hinge straps(?) on the 
     outside of the bus look fine.  The hinges didn't move when I tried 
     opening the hatch.  I didn't try forcing it.  I soaked hinges with 
     Liquid Wrench and then took a look at the hinge nuts on the inside of 
     the bus. Two of the four hinge cap nuts didn't look right.  
     
     The hinge cap nuts inside the bus are aluminum. I noticed that one of 
     the aluminum cap nuts had split down the side.   That cap nut broke 
     off and fell to the floor when I put a wrench on it.  It didn't take 
     any torque at all, the bolt had rusted completely through. The bolt or 
     stud is not aluminum. It looks as though the aluminum cap nut split 
     when the bolt rusted. 
     
     At that point I decided it wasn't going to be a quick fix job and went 
     to look for plastic to cover over the hatch.  By then it was raining - 
     of course.
     
     I'll finish pulling the hatch off this coming weekend and take a look 
     at how much rust and water damage the leak has caused.  I'll also get 
     a good look at what the hinges are made out of and what it will take 
     to fix.
     
     Thanks
     
     Steve

Is this the hatch that is about 2X3 feet and located above the floor space 
inside of the forward, rear door?  I haven't started looking for anything for 
this hatch on my bus, but I've considered purchasing an engine compartment lid 
seal from WCM or RMMW so that it doesn't leak again this winter.  It looks like 
there would be enough to do the job, and sizes are similar.  The hinge pieces 
that bolt through the roof look like something that could be turned out on a 
lathe fairly easily, and I have considered making an engineering drawing of 
these and checking with local machine shops as to cost for reproducing in 
aluminum.  Then I could get everything anodized for long life.  If the part that
actually attaches to the hatch is gone, that is another story.
     
Good luck,

     I'm new to the newsgroup.  I own an unrestored 1962 Westfalia camper. 
     My father in law purchased the car new in Germany in 62.  
     
     The hatch sunroof has failed.  The hinge seals leaked and rotted the 
     hinge bolts.  I've just started ordering catalogs and thought I'd ping 
     the newsgroup to try to get a quick pointer to anyone that still makes 
     hatch sunroof parts.  Does anyone still make or have parts for the 
     1962 hatch sunroof?
