I haven't been on the list very long and I'm really not all that vocal
but I have had my share of questions.  About three months ago I bought a
'78 Westy that had serious starter problems.  I don't know alot about
engines so I was afraid If I posted People might look at the problem and
think I was an idiot for not knowing the simple solution.  I finally
gained the strength and posted.  Within an hour of posting Josh had
already replied.  He gave me step by step instructions, respecting the
fact that I didn't have a clue what to do, and after a short time
Lucille(my Bus) was running like a dream.  He was the only responder to
my post and it was all I needed.  I'd never met any one so eager to help
and so willing to put up with VW ignorance.  I don't know why he did
what he did but I'm sure he had good reasons for it.  I send my
condolences to his family.  

I bet Josh is surrounded by a million busses right now just for his
amusement.  Peace Bud.

Rob + Lucille the Westy
