&gt; &gt; You don't want a
&gt; wider tire with your fragile worm-and-peg steering box!

The greatest stress on the steering box is when turning the wheels without
the bus moving.  Wider tires mean more force needs to be transmitted
through the box.

I suspect that the reason that VW switched to the worm-and-roller box in
'73 was because the wider radial tires were causing more failures thsn
the narrow bias ply tires.  I'm careful to never turn the wheels at a
standstill even with 185's.  Steering boxes are no fun to change and cost
$$$!
