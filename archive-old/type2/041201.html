Subject: Automatic Question

Hello,
  I just got a VW book and I saw that a 1979 bus was
available with an automatic instead of a stick.  Was
this available on any other years?  I do not like
stick as much when I am traveling-being tired and
would really like a stick-it's kind of fun and an
automatic.  Thanks a lot.

Peace,
Tim Hayes
