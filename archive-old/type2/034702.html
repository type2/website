Subject: Info Online (Re: Interesting Radio)

Hi,

I have the schematics of the radio right in front of me and it is an Emden
III. I forget who posted that but he/she was right. :-)

I scanned the info on it and posted it at:

The former owner's father bought this camper from a German factory and
brought it here to the US which I guess is why it has this radio?

Thanks,
Jen
