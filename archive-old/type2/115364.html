Subject: Hazet tool kit - '68 bus

Hello.

I just 'acquired' a round Hazet tool kit, one that fits into the spare tire 
on a pre '71 bus.  It fits like the hubcap, using the same mounting 
hardware.

I seem to be missing 3 wrenches and all (3 or 4) screwdrivers.  I only have 
these five pieces - large box wrench (36mm and smaller), the speed wrench, 
the spark plug socket wrench, the pliers and a 'T' handled socket that looks 
to be 13mm.  And of course the case.

Can someone tell me the sizes of the missing -3- wrenches, and the screw 
drivers??

TIA

Manumits sends
