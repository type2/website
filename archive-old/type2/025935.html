Think twice about where you park your bus!  Just thought I would share that
my bus was broken into last week and my stereo and a camara lens were
stolen.  Worst part is that they appear to have destroyed my dash.  The
sickening thought (as if that wasn't sickening enough) is that they seemed
to use my own tools from under the back seat to cut the wires to the stereo,
and my screwdrivers to rip it out of the dash.  Cops can't fingerprint and
have no suspects.  Needless to say, driving the bus makes me want to cry.
Dave
