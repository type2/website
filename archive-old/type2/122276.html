Subject: Engine stalling/Fuel question

Hi ya'll,
I can't seem to pinpoint a problem I am currently having. My engine stalls
sometimes at intersections, or when I'm stopped, usually for the first 30
minutes. But after several good minutes on a highway it runs like a champ
during any circumstance. I know my cold start valve works because I let the
'80 FI Vanagon warm up for 5-10 minutes, and I can hear the idle drop after a
few minutes of initial start. For the most part, during local stop-and-go
traffic, I usually have to rev the engine a little bit to keep it running.
And, when it does stall...it can take up to a minute before it will start. I
know it sounds screwy, but I can't decide on the reasoning for the difficult
restarts, if it's fuel starvation/flooding? My question is I guess..If it was
a plugged fuel filter (2-3 month old)..Why does the van run like doodoo at the
beginning and strong at the end? Wouldn't a clogged fuel filter/pump be
consistant for poor performance? Just trying to pinpoint the cause, but sure
could use some advice. Thanks.
