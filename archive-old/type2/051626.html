Listees,

Is there anyone out there that has bought a vehicle in Canada and brought it back to the US?  I am looking at buying a 91 Vanagon that is located in Canada and am getting the runaround from VWoA as far as whether the vehicle will meet US safety regulations.  I am sure that this has been done before and am just trying to find out what I need to do.

Thanks
