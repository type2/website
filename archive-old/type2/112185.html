Subject: Re: [T2] clickety-clickety-clickety steering noise

check all of your steering components.

you could have something that is just loose or your 
steering box could be on the way out.

jack up the bus securely &amp; have someone look underneath while you
move the steering wheel back &amp; forth. you should be able to
determine the source of the noise.

good luck,

Joel Wilson
