Gotta take the tube off.  Ought to pull the rear tin as well.  After that

&gt; Hey Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm in the middle of my first engine pull and have run into a little
&gt; obstacle. I have the engine and trans almost seperated( I can see the
&gt; flywheel)but can't seem to get it to move the last few inches so I can lower
&gt; it. There is about 1&quot; between the rear apron and the oil filler tube and I
&gt; didn't think I had to remove the tube from the sump, but I'm not sure there
&gt; is gonna be enough room. Anyone have an tricks for getting them seperated???
&gt; I keep pulling on the case but it seems like It won't move any further.
&gt; There isn't anything holding it back, just the trans shaft I think.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
