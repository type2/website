Subject: Re: [T2] my new bus

dan,

if you go to the library at type2_dot_com, under fuel, 
you will see two articles, one written by me about replacing fuel lines for a fuel injection bus (which yours was originally) and one for a carbureted bus which yours is now written by our man Shawn Luft.

between the two of these articles, you'll see what you need to replace your fuel lines.

there are too many pictures of burning buses floating around on the net. 

do this first.

feel free to p-mail me with questions, there's a direct link to me on the article also.

Billy
