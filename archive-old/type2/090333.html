Subject: Re: [T2] what happened to my Bus and a Friday thing...

&gt; Learn to work on it and any old vehicle will do it's job. It's just things
&gt; that wear out 'cause they are old or neglected...
&gt;
&gt; Just think what 6 years with a 20 year old VW bus costs you and what a 5
&gt; year car loan on a new car every 7 years or so costs you...

I like to ask people where all of the cars they see ...look around... will
be in 30 years? Gone Im sure.
