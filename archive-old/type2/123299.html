Subject: Re: [T2] RE: voltage regulator toasted UPDATE

Paul,

I'm coming in on this late and probably don't remember much of the 
of the previous part.

My personal method would be to:

verify that all connections were the correct ones.
*Triple* check the ground wires specifically.
disconnect the wire going up front to the gen/alt light if possible
	and then ohm it out to see if there is a short of any sort
	in it(battery disconnected first)...don't ask how I know!
have someone start it up while you have your meter set to volts
	and see if the value goes up to 13.8v or beyond that.
Look over the circuit for the gen/alt light...it relies
	on *good* positive voltage at the instrument panel
	part that connects with the base of the bulb.

Cheers, dave

&gt; the electricals were completed. I'd like to know if I need to buy

&gt; You mentioned as a part of the great Wells -v- Bosch debate that
&gt; sometimes seemingly unrelated breakdowns cause failures. I took that to
&gt; mean that there can be a short in one subsystem that manifests itself
&gt; in a completely unrelated system. It was insight into that statement
&gt; that I was seeking. I guess you thought I asked for a wrist slapping.
&gt; Now that you've gotten that out of your system, either add value or
&gt; don't respond.
