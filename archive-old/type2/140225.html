Subject: Which sway bar kit to use for '77 T2?

I've got my bus back on the road (thanks for all the help with the fuel pump 
problems), and one of the reasons it just failed the safety inspection was a 
broken sway bar bushing.

I could replace the stock bushing for less than $20, but I'm thinking I 
might as well install some aftermarket sway bars while I'm at it.  I've read 
Richard Atwell's informative page on the problems he had installing his Sway 
Away kit, so that has gotten me thinking about what I don't want to get 
into - with 2 small kids, I don't have the time to search for different 
bolts, modify brackets, etc.

So far, I've found three choices:

1. I think I've found a Sway Away kit that is still available for about $200 
for front and rear bars.  That would give me all of the problems Richard 
had, but some headaches might be avoided by using the $29 stainless clamp 
kit from aircooled_dot_net.

2.  I could get the Whiteline brand bars (made in Australia) from 
aircooled_dot_net, but these are expensive - $140 to $190 per bar, so the front 
and rear set would run me around $500 or more shipped to the East Coast.

3. I could get Empi bars from busboys or CIP1 for $80 per bar - the cheapest 
option.

My driving will be about half in town, and half on 3-4 hour trips to the 
beach.  I will only be driving the bus about 5,000 miles per year.

What's your advice?

TIA,  Andrew
