&lt;&lt; Who ever invented model years? they're too confusing. &gt;&gt;

FWIW, try getting a copy of Vance Packard's &quot;The Waste
Makers&quot; for an interesting study of the growth of &quot;model
years&quot; particularly by American cars in the fifties and
sixties...There really was no reasonable excuse for mak-
ing new models every year for a car that had no substantial
engineering changes. It was a marketing strategy to make
last year's car look so, well, last  year... ;-(
