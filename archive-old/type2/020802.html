&gt; My guess is that these guys are simply buying the stuff from Home Depot in

&gt; on the site than there used to be.  I have ordered the free samples and
&gt; will report back to the list when I get them and try them out.

Would this stuff have the same offensive odors as asphault roofing
materials.  &quot;Brown Bread&quot; is described on the webpage as &quot;supercharged
Bitumen based adhesive&quot;. Bitumen, from the American Heritage Dictionary
is &quot;any various flamable mixtures of hyrdocarbons and other substances
that are constituents of asphault and tar&quot;.
