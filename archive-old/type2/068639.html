Subject: Should I buy this 80 Westy - Cleveland Bred?

Went and looked at a 1980 Westy Vanagon today.  Interior had brown carpet 
on dash, floor...everywhere.  Dometic fridge, a 2 burner stove, and a sink. 
 Hookups on drivers side for water, AC, and some kind of key switch (???). 
 Also valves undernieth for other hookups.  Bed in poptop and fold down 
bench seat for bed. All cabinets.  Oh, and it runs pretty nice.  It also 
has a massive rear bumper equiped with a trailer hitch.

Its a Vanagon L Westy (saw the tag under the bench).

Asking $1195.00 for all.

Thats the good news.  Unfortunately there is a RUST problem.  About a foot 
below the hookups on the driver side there is a gap about an inch high 
completly rusted out.  To get to it from the inside all the cabinets behind 
the driver would have to come out.  The rust seemes to be only on the side 
panels and not on the bottom.

Is is worth the trouble?  Can the body panels be had anywhere?  I allready 
have 2 project busses and need somthing to drive in the winter, does the 
price seem fair.

Any input greately apprieciated. :)

TIA
