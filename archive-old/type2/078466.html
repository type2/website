Thank you everyone for all the experience and advice.

&gt; Instead of lacquer thinner try Berymens Chemtool Carb Cleaner. This stuff will
&gt; dissolve most anything including paint. So BE CAREFUL! But it's not as
&gt; explosive
&gt; as thinner and is designed for carb and F.I. systems so when used per the
&gt; instructions it will not eat your gaskets and/or O rings.
&gt; My Advise is to remove all metal fuel lines and soak in Chemtool at room temp.
&gt; (Not at 15 degrees like it was here this morning). Be very careful about doing
&gt; this in a garage, The fumes are extreeeeeeemly hazardous to your health.
&gt; Definitely read the can before use! Drain the solvent from the lines then blow
&gt; out
&gt; with compressed air. Don't even think about blowing them out by mouth! If you
&gt; don't have compressed air just drain them. Spray a little more chemtool
&gt; through
&gt; them until it runs out clean. Reassemble metal lines using new hoses and
&gt; clamps.
&gt; This cleaner can also be used in the gas tank to clear any varnish but be
&gt; prepared
&gt; to change clogged filters from the dislodged varnish.
&gt; Good Luck
