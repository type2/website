Subject: Mark your calendars (VW Euro 2000)

This is important news for European bus nuts (but the rest of the world is
welcome too).


VW EURO 2000: a new location for the new millennium.

(15, 16 and 17 September 2000)

For the past three years VW EURO took place at &quot;the Schatberg&quot; a luxury
camping in the southern part of Holland. A very good location but …. we
outgrew it. A new site had to be found if we wanted to sustain VW Euro's
growth. That's easier said than done because in densely populated Holland
large enough grounds with adequate facilities are scarce. However we think
we have found the ideal place. It's called Six Flags Holland and it is
located in the &quot;Flevo Polder&quot; about an hour from Amsterdam.

The new site is more centrally located and can easily be reached by car
(only a few minutes from motorway A28 near Harderwijk). Getting there by
train and bus from Amsterdam Airport is a lot easier than at the previous
location. The site is adjacent to the theme park itself and is a lot bigger
than the site we had before. However it is much easier to oversee and the
distances between the different activities will be less than in Sevenum. Of
course we will have all of the familiar events like the sprint, the parts
market the 'show and shine' etc. It will be different but certainly no less
than before.

Six Flags Holland offers visitors of VW Euro a lot of extras. With a
combination pass you (or your family) can visit VW Euro and the all new
spectacular theme park. Last year the park was still called &quot;Walibi Flevo&quot;,
a name familiar in Holland and Belgium. However the park has recently been
taken over by a giant American firm which operates the well known Six Flags
parks in the US and also owns the Warner Bros. Movie World theme parks. Six
Flags Holland will spearhead a chain of new parks in Europe. The park is
currently undergoing a major and very expensive reconstruction in which more
than 20 new rides are being added. You'll find a giant wooden roller coaster
and several modern steel ones. The kids will love the Loony Tooter train or
the Frog Hopper. There are shows like the new Trill Spectacular and you'll
meet all of the Warner Bros. Loony Toons favourites like Tweety, Bugs Bunny,
Sylvester and others.


VW EURO 2000 will never be the same again, it will be better! But it will
always be about air-cooled Vee-Dubs. Remember, it was Volkswagen who created
the only &quot;real&quot; millennium bug!
