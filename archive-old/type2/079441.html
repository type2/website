Subject: '73 IGNITION SWITCH

Does anyone have knowledge of the 73 ignition switch operation? Bently shows
me all but one wire (at least as far as I can see)  and that is a light gray
wire.  It connects to the Main 4.0mm Red + source only when the switch is
off.  What could this be for?  it almost sounds like it is part of the key
warning buzzer.  the book shows the brown wire to be the key warning.

Also and worse than my first question is that the 1.5mm black ignition
source only seems to connect to + sorce during the key on position and not
during the cranking position?  how do you get spark when cranking?  It does
not appear like GM where they take power from the starter solenoid to the
coil during cranking.

I have the switch out to make a key for the cylinder.
