Subject: Re: 74 Bay-window remodel

&gt;question about removing the bulkheads in anticipation of reclining front
&gt;bucket seats.

For what it's worth, this is a TUeV-approved modification. (TUeV=
technischer Ueberwachungsverein =  German enforcement agency for safety and
emissions; you need their written approval before changing anything to your
car, even adding a sun-roof or a tow-bar, for example.)

&gt;Unfortunately, if you put those seats in a bus, you will be hitting your
&gt;head on the ceiling and your view out the windows will be reduced.  If you
&gt;spend lots of time looking at scenery from the front seats of your bus like
&gt;I do, this will take it's toll on your neck.  If you're 5'6&quot; or under, it
&gt;may not be a problem.

Actually, that would be a problem, too, unless you like wearing high-heel
shoes; you'd be sitting so far up, your feet won't touch the floor. Or the
pedals.
