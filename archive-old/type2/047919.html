Subject: Re: [T2] replacing dash lights / or repairing dash light wiring

Just undo the speedo and the 4 screw holding the panel on and then you can
remove the panel and have some space to work with.  It makes things easier to
pull of the steering wheel (very easy just pry off the horn button and undo the
nut holding the wheel on.  once the panel is off just  just do one wire at a
time it looks like a huge tangle of wire ( i have only seen one bus where the
wiring was neat the way it came from the factory) but it is pretty straight
forward once you look at where everything is going (especially for the lights)
if you are only doing the lights just pull out each bulb and see if it is any
good and check the wiring to see if it is broken the lights should be wired in
series with the metal frame of the gauge cluster as ground so also check the
little contact on the side of the bulb holders and make sure it will make a good
contact with the surrounding metal frame for the ground, this can stop the
lights from working.  but if you are redoing any wiring just do one wire /
system at a time so things don't get messed up
good luck
feel free to email me with any detail questions
