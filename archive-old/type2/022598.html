 Eastern Daylight , type2-digest-help_at_type2_dot_com writes:&gt; I personally use and 
abuse a Jamie Rivers trailer hitch and I will vouch for
&gt;  its perfect fit, super strong construction and with the removable receiver,
&gt;  its barely visible. Jamie did a great job and his price is WELL worth it.
&gt;  This hitch is the quality of, if not better, then the Reese and Hidden 
Hitch
&gt;  styles we all see. AND, as Jamie said, it bolts into the existing bus with
&gt;  NO modification.
&gt;  
&gt;  Have a look for yourself! You wont be dissapointed....
