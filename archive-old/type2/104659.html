Subject: Re: [T2] Getting a rebuilt engine

&gt; to be able to talk turkey with the craftsman/journeyman that does 
&gt; the work. This is typically someone who is well worth 3 or 4 times 
&gt; the hourly rate of an assembly line nerd. I use NW Con Rod in 
&gt; Seattle, but just north of you in Boston is Boston Bob, a similar 
&gt; operation. Even if I lived in NJ, if I needed a motor for MY keeper 


OK, I'll pipe in...
I talked with Boston Bob extensively just the other night.  He knows his 
stuff and he's fun to talk to.  But, he said he will not bother to build an 
engine smaller than 2000cc and suggested that I get a transmission, fuel 
tank, and motor out of a late bay, install the transmission and gas tank and 
send in the motor for a core to him.  His engines start at $2000.  I'm not 
saying that this is not worth it - I'm still batting around going that route 
myself, but it may be too much work for what you want.  I'm leaning toward a 
smaller engine and doing it myself right now.
