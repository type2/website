Subject: killed my 1971
Message-ID: &lt;3761F642.46B16164_at_cartsys_dot_com&gt;

well, long story short: i drove my 1971 for 4 days with the oil light
on. she always did leak oil (incredible amounts!), and so she died. she
started to shudder and slow down, losing power til she died. shaking and
making knocking sound. got some oil in her later that day, she drove til
that night, same thing happened. please, im sorry, no judgements, i know
what i did was wrong. i havent touched the van in a couple of months. i
can give more details...anyone who might be able to help?
mailto:rob_at_cartsys_dot_com  thanks. rob
