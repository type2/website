Subject: [T2] Way to much fuel

I decided to change the plugs the other day and was amazed at the carbon 
build up as it had been running pretty good.  I put the exact same (new) 
plugs in and took her out for a ride.  When I got on the open road it was OK 
up to fourth and then it started falling on its face at about 45-50.  So out 
come the new plugs and once again carbon resin way to black and thick.  It 
also seems like it's running a little rough. But if you gas it the motor 
eventually smoothes out.  What gives.  If it was fuel injected I'd try 
adjustment but with this 2.0 dual carb motor I find it strange that both 
sides are looking identical in blackness and resin.  Any ideas?  It seems to 
do OK now at 50 plus miles an hour.
