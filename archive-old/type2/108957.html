Subject: aftermarket fuel pump hook-up

I traced the hot wire on the pump to one of the contacts on the coil.  The
pump comes on when you turn the key.

I want to install the recommended relay so that the fuel pump cuts off when
the engine stops.  But without FI, where's the best place to tap for the
relay?

I'm assuming that the existing wire can be the hot lead, but that I need a
wire that is &quot;off&quot; when the engine is not running to activate the relay.

I'd search the archives, but I've been on-line for hours+ with work and my
son needs to finish up some school work tonight.

Thanks.
