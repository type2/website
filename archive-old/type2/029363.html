I am told that you must support the tranny on latter
buses or risk damage, but this does not come from personal first hand
knowledge so hopefully others can add support or dispute this.  my
perception is that it is a good idea and the reasons given to me made alot
of sense.  A vw mechanic told me this, he said on the latter buses with
type 4 the engine and tranny were designed to be removed as a unit as the
engine suports one end of the unit and the trany the other, he told me to
use a jackstand , rope or chain to support the trany if i dropped the
engine out alone.
good luck
Jamie
