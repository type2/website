Subject: Re: [T2] painting question



&gt; If I had six vehicles at my home that needed paint, my neighbors would
&gt; run me out of town for having a junk yard.
&gt; I say; sell five of those junkers and use the money for a first class
&gt; steak dinner. Spend whatever is left over on a professional paint job.

Hey! You're talking about my car family! Be careful!
Actually, two are on the way out. A couple of old beater trucks.. We paid a
guy to prep one and he did a terrible job, never finished, just made it look
like heck. We'd take a $300 loss at least to sell it this way. We're far
worse off than when he started. This was my husband's idea, by the way. I
had my doubts. I knew the guy was a drinker, and sure enough, he'd get a
little advance money, go off drinking, and show up four days later with a
buddy to help him. He always had a different buddy.. I don't think he paid
them anything. Finally we'd already paid him almost all of the agreed price
and he came to the door for another advance.. We told him, &quot;No, finish first
and we'll pay you off&quot;. His response was to come back when we weren't here
and to steal some tools. Well, we should have known better..  :0(  Sadder
but wiser, Jan B
