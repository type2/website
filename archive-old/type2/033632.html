Subject: Various questions about my 73 bus...

I want to add an oil pressure sensor (not a switch, but a sensor) and a tach
to my bus. I think I shouldn't have a problem with the tach, but was
wondering if anyone had a good source for one. I would like to mount it in
the spare gauge hole in my dash (I guess it was an option to have a clock in
the spare hole) if I could...

I want to add an oil pressure sensor as well so I can get a reading of oil
pressure (not just an on/off light). I have been told that there are two
types, electrical and ones with a tube that runs all the way from the engine
to the gauge. But busses are long and none of the oil pressure kits I have
found at stores have a tube long enough. So I'm thinking an electric one
would be the easiest, but I can't find one anywhere, all the local parts
shops have the tube type...

What is the best oil I can get (for a bus) and what weight oil should I use?

My year bus has dual carbs, but the previous owner installed a single carb
conversion. I want to replace the carb (not the conversion kit, just the
carb) or at least get a rebuild kit for it. How can I go about finding out
what kit and/or carb this is? A friend said its probably a Weber, but I
don't see any brand names on the carb (I may just have to look more
closely). Is there anything specific to webers I can look for? Where's a
good place to get parts for non-stock carbs? If I replace the carb with a
new one, do I have to get the exact same one, or do you think I can get a
different carb (assuming same bolt pattern)? If so, what carb should I get?

Is there a kit to put it back to a dual carb setup? If so, any information
on this would be very helpful!

How many amps can the alternator supply?

Thanks! I'm a newbie big time, so forgive me if these are lame questions, I
don't have many resources outside of this list and newsgroups.
