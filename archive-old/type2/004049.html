&gt; Hi All ,
&gt;
&gt;    We have an oil leak in the back area on our 78 van. The engine runs OK
&gt; and has OK compression. I have eliminated the rear crank seal, the valve
&gt; covers, the oil cooler, the oil pump, the oil filler pipe ,the oil filter
&gt; and the dip stick tube. The only thing I can think of is that maybe one of
&gt; the oil pressure relief valves is sticking and forcing too much oil to the
&gt; top of the engine at high RPM . There is evidence of oil on the electric
fan
&gt; above the oil breather and oil inside the air intake ducting.
&gt;   So, does that sound like a good theory? Can too much oil pressure force
&gt; oil out the oil breather?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Neil Sundberg
