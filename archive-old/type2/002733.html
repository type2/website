I want to thank everyone who responded,unfortuately my system crashed the
next day takeing everything with it. : (
the upside really seemed that it depended on the mood of the agent. Some
sailed thru with no prob, while others gave up in disgust.
Unfortuately, just as I started to close the deal with the seller, it turned
out that all he had was a copy of rhe title as the original was lost.Not
wanting to risk the cost and time of renting a dolly, I bid him adieu and
hauled ass back to the border.Liveing on the island has one downside, and
thats if you miss the 10:45 ferry, you're sleeping in your car. Needless to
say there's still some radar out there wondering what the hell flew by and I
still ended up flying onto the boat as the arm came down.
otoh, for those that might be interested theres a fairly nice 74 westy out
there with some running problems that can be picked up cheap. Also a 67
westy with rust issues but a fairly complete interior that comes with a
spare bus.
If anyones interested p-mail me and I'll give you the details.
Thanks everyone
Chuck
