&gt;I too wanted to avoid the dreaded door mangle, 


On speaker placement,,,

I chose to drill a few holes in my dash using the same pattern and size as the
factory speaker that is in the center of the dash,, 

I have loads of people tell me all the nit picky things that are &quot;not right&quot;
with my bus when at shows,,, but no one has spotted this as a &quot;Hack&quot;... so far!

In fact,, the people I have pointed this out to,, are sure it *IS* factory,,,,
&lt;grin&gt; 

I did this in my driveway when I replaced the windshield seal....

here is a picture of the passenger side of my dash, notice the grab handle for
reference,

I was able to fit roughly 11&quot; x 4 &quot; speaker with 2 little speakers inside
that... 
take out the glove box, and slip the gauge cluster out a bit to get access.

Hope that helps
Jamie Rivers
