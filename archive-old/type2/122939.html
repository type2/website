Subject: Re: [T2] idiot guide book for vw's

&gt;James:
&gt;
&gt;The John Muir Book,  HOw to keep your VW alive for the Compleat Idiot was 
&gt;available on line from Amazon 2 years ago when I got mine.  It's a must 
&gt;have book if you are going to be lying under your Bus, using tools and 
&gt;looking up into the Engine....

And thats the one I want to get. I do have the Bently that I bought
from a fellow member here on the list. Some of the Bently is too technical
in a way that having something else to compare to in a bit more layman's
terms would be helpful.

The tech who was working on my bus is a great aircooled fanatic and was
wanting me to keep on top of possible things. He knows I want to drive
it as a daily (which I have been) driver.

Wish I had more local fellow peeps interested in these great zenlike
vehicles ;)

Thanks for the advice! and help!
