	Well it only took six hours but my engine is now sitting on the 
floor of my garage.  I can barely believe I just took the engine out.  I
keep looking at the gaping hole in my engine compartment and praying that
I can get it back in.
	I plan to pull off the heads and do the rings on the left side
tonight and hopefully remove those broken studs in the right side head.
My new AVP head will be hear by noon tomorrow--I hope. 
	I am a little confused about how I removed the engine.  I planned
to use Sean Bartnik's method and was all done with the procedure but the
engine/tranny combo wouldn't fall at all.  Now I did only find two
mounting bolts on the front of the tranny to remove (Bartnik mentions 4)
and I could not find any clutch slave cylinder mounted on the left side of
the tranny to remove.  As the engine wouldn't come I just  bolted the
tranny back in, chained a bar under it and pulled just the engine.  So
much for my original plans of leaving them together.  
Question?
	Should I drop the tranny--since everything bolted onto it
is already removed--bolt the two together and reinstall that way?  I am
leaning towards this because it sounds impossible the other way.  I pulled
it by myself today but I could probably arrange to have someone help me
get it back in.
Its a '79 2.0 liter.
