Subject: Re: [T2] Wiring a spare (camping) battery in to a 78 bus

This is really pathetic! I have the very same kit, instructions and diagrams 
long stared at with cow-like incomprehension, sitting in a drawer at home, 
along with a mighty 400-watt power inverter that I'd intended to put on the 
second battery. Sadly, I won't even have the facilities to work on this 
project until the summer, since I'm at school right now. If nothing else, 
though, I'll solve this problem for us all in a few months, or die an 
explosive electrical death trying.
