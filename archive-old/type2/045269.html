&quot;Last week I went to fill the gas tank on my 1973 bus, (the gauge showed
empty) when lo and behold, the tank filled with only 8.5 gallons!! When I
came back from the cashier with the change, there was a MAJOR gas
&quot;waterfall&quot; on the left side of the engine!!! The filling is done on the
right side of the bus, but the leak was on the left side!!! Did anyone have
this happen to them before?? &quot;

Yes just recently in my '77 it leaked out of the expansion pipe above the
aux battery on the left side, there is a rubber 1/4&quot; or so 2-3&quot; long
connector between 1/4&quot; metal tubing that loops up into the air vent. my
rubber tubing needed replacing, it's not easy a real back breaker to reach
up where it is, taking out battery if you have one there makes it easier.
The pipe is for fumes comes from gas tank for some reason I haven't figured
out sometimes with a strong pump at gas station gas goes up there??
