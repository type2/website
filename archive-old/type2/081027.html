&gt;    was at the Maryland state surplus outlet in Jessup yesterday and they
&gt; had a full fleged Bear Exhaust Gas analyzer for $100, would have grabbed
&gt; it but it was too large for my avaliable space so if any FI folks need it
&gt; grab it quick.  (and then let me borrow it to check my engine)
