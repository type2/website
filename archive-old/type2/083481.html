&gt; I would like to install a modern brake switch that goes on at the very

&gt; I've had too many close calls with the standard slow responding switch
&gt; mounted on the master cylinder. I figure a modern switch would give those
&gt; tailgaters another second of warning to start to react sooner.

If you want really quick reaction, install a switch the lights the brake
lights when the throttle is closed.  That way they'll see the lights
without having to wait for your foot to reach the brake pedal!
