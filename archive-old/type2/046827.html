Well, I know a guy that bought a pretty nice looking Champagne Edition Westy 
for $2,600.00 ( and didn't even know what a CE was, that's what kills me!) 
Now there's a vehicle that theoretically is worth $2,600.00. It may be a much 
better deal than some of the 8K and up Westy's out there for sale. It was 
well maintained, not a rust bucket, so it didn't need a major resto. Now, on 
the other hand, someone buys a $500.00 basket case, spends countless hours 
and $$$ restoring it, and now wants to sell it for $8,000.00, and granted 
they probably have much more than $8,000.00 invested it.   And I always worry 
when I see ads that say &quot;rebuilt engine, low miles&quot;, because I see even more 
that say &quot;rebuilt engine w/5K miles, not running&quot;   Jeff S.
