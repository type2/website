Bad new fuel pump in a Honda.  Since I just replaced the pump, must be
clogged fuel line.  Lying under the car in the Fire Dept parking lot.  Blew
thru the pickup line, and a shot of gas came back out straight up my nose,
into my eyes and mouth.  Blind and couldn't breathe.  Out from under the car
in a tenth of a second, pictured in my mind were the building and door was,
pushed off from the car with my arms outstreched untill I struck the
building.  Clawed my way down the side of the building untill I found
somthing that felt like a door.  Beat on that sucker like Fred Flinstone.
Woke EMS up and went for a ride, lights and everything.  Fun fun fun.
