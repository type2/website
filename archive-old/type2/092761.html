Subject: Re: [T2] Horns As Usual


&gt; &gt; Seems like all my posts have to do with horns.  Here's my contribution for
&gt; &gt; today.......I'm looking for the OEM Bosch horn for a 1970 Bus.  Not an
&gt; &gt; aftermarket Bosch but the original from 1970.  I've struck out twice at 
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; local boneyards so far.  I'm going to set the Bus up with dual horns 
&gt; and I'd
&gt; &gt; like them to be the same.  Does any kind soul out there have one in good
&gt; &gt; working order they'd like to get rid of?
&gt; &gt;

You need a tuned pair - a hi and a low. You can get regular tuned horns at 
any FLAPS. Two VW horns would sound rotten - like two instruments slightly 
out of tune.

Maybe they would sound so bad people would get out of your way.... &lt;grin&gt;

I plan to run air horns for the highway and the regular horn for in town 
with a toggle switch for whatever mood I'm in.
