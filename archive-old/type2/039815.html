Please respond to leigh.travis_at_btinternet_dot_com
	
&gt;I was wondering if you knew where I could find details of body and chassis
&gt;dimensions for a '71 (baywindow) T2 Bus (Dormobile minibus) and a '75 1200
&gt;Bug?
&gt;
&gt;I have scoured the web, but have only seen the pre '67 reference at your T2
&gt;web site.
