&gt;Michael,
&gt;  I concur with David, have been setting my exhaust valves at 0.008&quot; for
&gt;years. What's more, I have the original VW tuneup sticker on the engine
&gt;(engine code AW, 1800cc), and it says 0.006&quot; intake, 0.008&quot; exhaust. The
&gt;extra clearance is because they're sodium-filled for more efficient heat
&gt;transfer.

I have to add that although the manuals say the exhaust valves are sodium
filled, I have never seen any that were, except for the ones I installed
myself.
As far as I know, none of the type IV breadloaves sold in the US came with
sodium filled valves.
