John, list:
Yeah, me too! If you could see the sorrowful old 58 deluxe sunroof I'm trying
to fix up (well, dreaming of fixing up), anything that drove would be pretty
tantalizing!
While on the subject of windows, I really need ALL the 58 deluxe-specific
glass for it, especially the back hatch glass, which is different than a
kombi or standard, but no one ever saved! also need the skylites and 1 corner
glass. Damn kids!
I'd appreciate it if someone could post to the splitty list.
Thanks,
