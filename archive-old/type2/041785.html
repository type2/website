Subject: Re: L-Jetronic Tuning Question

Hmmmm... Since a CO2 analyzer is probably easier to find, is there a
magic CO percentage that relates to the A/F ratio?  Otherwise I guess I
could also go the route of putting on an O2 sensor and do the readings
that way.  Plus, then I can monitor changes without going to a shop all
the time.

What I'm beginning to wonder is how people rebuild these AFMs and how
they calibrate them to factory spec.  There's got to be another way than
hooking it up to an exhaust gas analyzer.

Thanks for the info!
Mike

&gt; &gt;David,
&gt; &gt;So can an exhaust gas analyzer tell you what your fuel ratio is?  If so,
&gt; &gt;then I guess my question has been answered.  If not, do I need specific
&gt; &gt;percentages when I go in?
&gt; 
&gt; I guess I wasn't reading closely enough.  I'm not sure what the analyzers
&gt; can tell you - what you need is a wideband O2 sensor, which some
&gt; performance tuning shops will have.  The only easy way to tell what your
&gt; A/F ratio is under part or full throttle is on a chassis or engine dyno.
&gt; If you don't want to remove your engine from the bus, find a chassis dyno
&gt; with a wideband - that's what I did.
