Subject:  Using SAE30 in 2.0 FI with Hydraulic lifters...

l
Greetings.

I've been using 20-50 in my 77 with good results however, I just arrived in
Tucson AZ a few days ago and despite driving through the night from San
Diego, the bus was just getting too hot to run over 52-53 mph. I'm planning
on driving all the way to the east coast and would like to run at about
60mph if I can keep the oil temp down. A local in Tucson recommended running
straight 30. Would running this heavy of an oil be bad for the Hydraulic
lifters?

I know the oil topic has become a bit tiresome for a few of the elders out
there but any feed back would be great.

Cheers
 -Dave A.
