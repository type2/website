Subject: [T2] any good mechanics SoCal

    Hey all, my girlfriend is having engine problems. Sounds like its a 
simple as fouled plugs. Why dont I do it you say? 'cause shes in Riverside, 
Ca and I'm currently freezing in the great white north. So anybody know 
someone they can recommend in the Riverside area?
Please respond to me and I'll pass it on to her. Thanks
Chuck
