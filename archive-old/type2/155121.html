&gt;i just got my brand new  bosch fuel pump from the bus depot today and when i
&gt;went to install it i noticed that there are no marking on the connector to
&gt;tell me where to plug the positive or negative.

The old pumps used to have a + painted on the silver body by the connector.

&gt;i need to know if i plug
&gt;them in reverse do i stand the risk of burning this bad boy up.

No, I don't think so.

&gt;does
&gt;anyone know how to bench test one of these before i try to put it on my bus.

Just run some fuel to it and attach 12v to it (use a switch to reduce sparking).

1.5-2L/min is the minimum flow rate (open circuit). If you have the pressure regulator attached then the spec is 1L/min.
