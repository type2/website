&gt;OK, here's what I've found:
&gt;1) No spark from the coil.  Coil is new (I had replaced it a few months
&gt;ago, since I thought it was the culprit.)

Coil was new. It could have been fried by the malfunctioning ignition
module. When ever you have tested a bad coil, suspect the ignition module
as the source of the problem.

&gt;2) There is 12V at terminal 1 of the coil.
&gt;3) Went through the Bently diagnostics for the Ignition Control Unit
&gt;(Section 20.2, page 78.)  Step 5 of the test failed: voltage did not drop
&gt;when the jumper to the center terminal of the 3-point plug on the
&gt;distributor was removed from ground.
&gt;4) Replaced the Ignition Control Unit ($60?!): still experiencing the
&gt;starting problem - no spark.

If you skip steps in the Bentley procedure, you can get bad diagnosis. You
must validate each item in sequence for accurate diagnosis. That starts on
the first page of the section. Don't skip a single word, sentance or step
or you can get a bad diagnosis. When you thereby prove a failed component,
replace it then continue to validate the remaining items. Short cuts and
guessing is a road to hell, just like bad data from a multimeter designed
to be cheap.   

&gt;
&gt;Questions:
&gt;I now suspect that the Hall sending unit is faulty.  (grumble, grumble.)
&gt;Anyone ever replaced one of these before? 

Bentley gives the procedure for testing it. Yes, if Bosch or VW lists it as
a separte kit, it is replaceable.

  Would it be easier to just get a rebuilt
&gt;distributor?

Yes, but much more spendy. 

&gt;
&gt;Looks like Hall units are $100 at the FLAPS, comparable to other prices
&gt;I've found.  What a pain!  

Stop wasting your money on FLAPS wannabe parts. And rather than getting a
stock Fairchild or Telefunken, get the Bosch unit. Far more durable. Will
not fry your coil. When your DigiJunk ECU goes south, do yourself the same
favor and replace it with the Bosch unit for the same reason. More systems
protective components incorporated equals better value despite the extra
up-front cost.

Just 'cause VW cheapened out on some of their parts it doesn't necessarily
mean you have to. 

More than once I have seen one of the wires to the Hall Sensor grounding
intermitantly 'cause the plastic is broken, which shorts the module and, if
not a Bosch unit, can fry the coil. They are easy to break if you are not
quite careful when pulling the terminal housing. And make sure the rubber
boot is in good order. A drop of water in there can create the same kind of
mayhem.
