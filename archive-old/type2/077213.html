Subject: New Type 2s with radiators....

While messing around in Mexico two weeks ago, I noticed literally hundreds
of new type 2s with several interesting variations.

I don't know if these are Mexican local buses or imports from Brazil, but
one in 4 had a radiator....gasp. Gasoline engines. With a spot in the front
with a black plastic grill for a radiator. Stock. I actually wanted one.

Anybody seen a closeup of these wasserboxers that look like 79 vintage type
2s? With their black grills?

I also saw hundreds and hundreds of BRAND SPANKING NEW old style Type 1s. I
asked the year model on one and the answer was &quot;dos mil dos&quot;. 2002.

Gorgeous. They are still making those in Puebla, where they make the new
Beetles.
