Subject: [T2] Bus and science fair

Hello list!

A brief thing.  This week my 14 year old son entered his school science
fair.  He wanted to build a wind tunnel and test/show the effect of wind
as it passes over a vehicle.  The test vehicles? 60's era bus and
beetle!!  It worked beautifully and he got first place in engineering,
an honorable mention overall, and moves on to regionals at the local
college!  I was proud!
