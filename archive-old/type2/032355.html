Subject: Pacesetter muffler

I'm looking to buy a new muffler, and I'm wondering if anyone has any
experience with the &quot;Pacesetter&quot; muffler that the Bus Depot sells for $80? 
What's it look like?  Is it the same as the one JC Whitney sells as part
#89LV6171X?  (Note, I'm not looking to buy it from JCW, but they have a
picture in their catalog.)  The current muffler on my bus is a rusted-out
Monza-style thing with four chromed tips.  I'd like something a bit less,
well, tacky-looking if possible.
