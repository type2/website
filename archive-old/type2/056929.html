Subject: '72 With Weber 32/36 (continued)

Hi all,
	I've gotten quite a few e-mails from everybody, but not one said
that they were able to really get the carb to run correctly! The closest
one got was when using a vac advance dizzy, with the vacuum advance
mechanism disconnected and timing advanced at idle enough to make 32
degress total advance (with the centrifugal force alone, and vacuum
disconnected). I'm going to try that. But I just had one question.

Does anybody out there in the entire world have a bus with a Weber 32/36
that really does run *CORRECTLY*?

Thanks again list,
John Tracy
