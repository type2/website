Brian, start by looking at your fuel filter. If there's a bunch of crap in it, that could be your problem. Unfortunately for you, there are a bunch of things that can cause the symptoms you describe. Fortunately, the most common problems are not major.

Do you know if the PO ran it very much? You might have water in your gas.

Well, here's a list of things to check.

Fuel pump. Just because she starts, doesn't mean you're getting the right volume of fuel. Search the type2 archives (www.type2_dot_com; click on &quot;archives&quot;) for your symptoms as well as for fuel pump test. You're looking for &quot;fuel pump volume&quot; ...the volume required and the way to test that...by turning over with the line to the carb disconnected and pointed into a container of known volume.

Vacuum lines. Easy fix, probably should check these first. These are the little lines going to the carb. Don't have 'em? Well, there should be some plugged up tubes on the carb then.

Brake booster. On the '71 bus, there's a brake booster for the front brakes. There's a long vacuum line coming up from there and connecting to the side of the intake manifold (the riser tubes that the carb sits on top of). Look on the left side as you look in the engine compartment. If this line is off, you should reconnect it. You may also want to look under the driver's seat (under the bus) at the brake booster and see if that's still connected.

Intake leaks. Harder to fix; important. We're talking about the little boots on the intake manifold. See the carburator? Go lower. See that metal tube going across your engine. Intake manifold. There's a boot on each side. Just about gotta pull the engine to replace it. No big deal, just plan a long Saturday for your first engine pull. If these things are old or cracked or loose, you may have found the problem. Even if you get the bus running okay, don't settle for leaky intake boots...or you'll pay the price in heads later on. And they cost much more than the boots...and are harder to replace. Other intake leaks could be at the gaskets where the intake manifold connects to the heads.

This is a good start. You really need to get a book like Muir's &quot;How to keep your VW Alive&quot;; it'll help you troubleshoot. You'll also want to spend $25 and get the Bentley manual. I've got a couple I'm about to put on the Internet for sale, but they've got color wiring diagrams and will be pricey when all is said and done.

Ultimately, I'd suspect something to do with the vacuumm and the fuel because, when you first start the bus, you are getting a fuel mix based on the choke position; once it's started, the vacuum kicks in, drawing the fuel into the engine. If the vacuum is wrong because of leaks, etc. she'll stall.

Air, spark, and fuel...that what makes our engines go. They are 3 different systems that intersect with each other.

NOW THE DISCLAIMER: ***I AM NOT A MECHANIC. *** I've been known to be wrong. I'm copying this to the list in the hopes that any BS I'm spreading will be corrected by other knowlegeable persons.

Thanks! Joe
 
&gt;The PO said that the engine was rebuilt about 2 years &gt;ago now, but I don't know (some of the tubing doesn't &gt;look so great).  

PS: All POs are bad people; that is their role in our lives. All our bus problems are their fault.  :)
