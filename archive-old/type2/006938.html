&gt;How come he gets all the credit?? AFAIK, the idea was conceived, borne, and
&gt;raised by Tobin and Christa out of Vancouver. Ron merely did the website.

     That's how I remember it. Once again, a big bravo for an wonderful 
idea...
&gt;
&gt;Through the grapevine, I heard that the trip turned political, the group
&gt;breaking up into various factions. My point? I don't expect Tierra del Fuego
&gt;to be a pleasant experience if you're independently-minded and don't like to
&gt;be bossed around. Let's not turn this into a thread before Friday.

     To a certain extent, yes. 'Twas unfortunate. But, not all that 
suprising. Bus folks tend towards being opinionated and independent, if 
we weren't we'd be in a minivan or american iron. Put lots of opinionated 
independent folks with high expectations in one place and attempt to give 
them guidance, and you're sure to have a mess on your hands in short 
order. Kinda like herding cats away from the food bowl at mealtime. Not 
something I really want to try. 

     That being said, I did my best to ignore the politics and just enjoy 
the scenery, of which there was plenty, and the company which was good 
regardless. It wasn't really all that hard, just take the garbage with a 
grain of salt. After all, I know that I'm right anyway, so if someone 
else is wrong, so what? Thier problem, not mine. &lt;evil smirk, as he baits 
for napalm replies&gt; See what I mean about independent and opinonated??

;-)



Peace,
