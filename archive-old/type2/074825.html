Subject: Memphis 1974 Kombi FS

Hey folks,


I was contacted by this bus owner who needs to sell a bus. It sounds like a
good deal to me. I will give the list subscriber that referred it ( your
referral has to be to the purchaser) and the person who buys this bus, both
a $25.00 gift certificate towards parts from BUStedBUS. Same person? $50.00

Please contact these folks about the bus,

1974 VW Kombi Bus Needs clutch work. Is in running condition. We used it as
a primary vehicle as well as taken it on road trips. Moving out of state and
must sell. Everything works (blinkers, lights, horn, etc) No rust on the
body. New tires. Original interior. Must see! located in Memphis TN
