There are a lot of folks on the Vintagebus list with  Puch fetishes. 
I suggest you let them know about your site. If you are not 
subscribed let me know and I will forward it for you.

&gt;I found an eriba puck the other day, pictures at
&gt;http://hometown.aol_dot_com/disconcerter/puck.html
&gt;Anyone have any literature on these? A tent for one? a puck they are parting
&gt;out?
&gt;thanks
