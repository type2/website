Subject: cylinder head temp

All,
  I know this question has been asked but I am going to ask again. I would
like to know who has a cylinder head temp sensor on a 1979 2.0 FI. I would
like for you to tell me your average temps. I am trying to figure out if my
if my sensor is telling me false readings. Please e-mail me. Thanks
everybody.
