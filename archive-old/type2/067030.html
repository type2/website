A person turns off lights to indicate the lane in FRONT of them is 
open, high beams to indicate a problem.

Example: A truck is passing me, he starts to make the lane change in 
front of me but he's too close to be safe, I flash my bright lights.  
Trucker stays in current lane until I briefly turn my headlights off, 
thus indicating that it is safe to go in front of me.  Trucker makes 
safe lane change to spot in ffront of me.  Trucker signals thanks by 
turning off his tail lights.

Sorry if there were some implied contortions involved.

&gt; Um, let's see. Am I missing something? A trucker turns on his high beams to 
&gt; tell the person behind him that there's someone coming the other way too close?
