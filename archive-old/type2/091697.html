&gt; As late as about 1957 we still had a wonderful public transportation
&gt; system in Los Angeles and surrounding cities.. the &quot;Red Car&quot; system. I
&gt; remember it very well, even though I was very little then. It was like
&gt; the San Francisco cable cars, but it moved on rails and was energized by
&gt; an overhead network of electrically charged cables. You could go a lot
&gt; of places on the Red Cars, from the LA harbor to downtown LA and
&gt; beyond.. But with the advent of automobiles in every garage, it all
&gt; disappeared. Jan B

I had heard a number of times that General Motors actually bought up all
the cable-car and trolleys in the US and ripped up the tracks -
specifically to encourage people to buy cars. But I can't find any
supporting info on the web right now... Plenty of info on the cable car
tracks being paved over in San Francisco.
