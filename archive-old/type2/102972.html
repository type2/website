Subject: Re: [T2] Long (dong silver) Mirror 

&gt; First, my thanks to Andy for his &quot;subtle&quot; hint to check the archives. :O^
:)

&gt; 1. My bus' mirror stem is about 3.5&quot; (approx. 89mm) from the forward-facing
&gt; edge of the mounting flange to where the ball enters the mirror itself.  Is
&gt; this the large-sized stem, or one of the smaller ones?

Sorry little guy :) Mine is 6&quot;. I just measured it. :)

&gt;
&gt; 2. (After learning from the archive how to...) I removed my mirror to look
&gt; it over, and noticed that the collar that accepts the ball seems to be
&gt; deteriorating.  While I understand that it would be easier just to replace
&gt; the entire assembly, is it possible to disassemble the mirror for repairs
&gt; without damaging the glass itself?  If so, how; and has anyone here
&gt; tried/done this?

This is pretty common and Id be glad to listen to suggestions on this
one.

&gt; 3. What prevents the long stem from being installed in some buses?

I con only say from experience with 68 and 69. The long mirror is
identical mounting wise.

Im not versed on mirror minutia but Im sure Karl probably knows if and
when there were differences in mounting. Hopefully he'll chime in.
