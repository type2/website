Nate and Kate,

You are so right about checking out how you feel about a bus before
buying it.  Last year my VW mechanic aquired a '76 California Westy with
auto and air.  It had absolutely no rust, one dent and some minor nose
body work left by the PO to do.  I told him I wanted it but he hadn't
the time to finish it right then.  I even had the money for it.  Well a
year went by and he still had the camper.  I had spent the money and
just recently got a bonus check so now I could look into it again..

I droped by the other day and found that the nose was done.  I told him
I wanted to test drive the thing and gave him a date.  Stopped by at the
appointed date and found it still in the same state as it was 3 months
ago, but still not road worthy.  It needs tires and runs a little
rough.  He hadn't the time for it and he wouldn't let it out of the yard
until it is right.   So my wife and I sat in the thing, just to spend
some time feeling its karma.  Neither the wife nor I felt that it was
right for us.

Now this van is owned by a garage that we know and trust.  We know the
mechanics by their first name and admire their work mightly.  The only
problems that that van will have after this guy gets done with it is
that it has this ugly platform welded about 6&quot; above the luggage rack by
a PO.  It will still have the 4&quot; dent in the right rear quarter panel
and will need a coat of paint (sunburst yellow).  He wants about $3700
for it.

After the trip to garage, wifie and I felt a bit low spirited.  So I
went over to our '76 Westy that's rusting quitely in the backyard and
just stood there, looked at it and sighed.  Then it came to me that
maybe we should check out the'ol girl (also a '76 Westy) and see if it
could be put back on the road.  I mentioned the feeling that I had about
the camper beeing put back on the road to wifie and she said that she
had that same feeling.  So we have decided to look into the possibility
of getting the 'ol girl back on the road.

Now my rough estimate is about $5,000 to fix it.  It doesn't economic
make sense to fix, but somehow it seems the thing to do.  But you know
something, it sure feels good to be working on that camper again.  I
don't think that I'd have the same feeling about the other one.

One more thing, this camper has been in a fire.  It was rescued by it's
second owner who cleaned it up, took the FI off, substituted a stick for
the orginal auto and then sold it to me.  In a sense it has died twice.

You know, I think I'll call it Rusty, the Westy that refused to die.
