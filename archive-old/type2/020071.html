Subject: Re: [T2] Westy Covers for winter?
References: &lt;E13oogu-0004ap-00_at_smtp02.mrf.mail.rcn_dot_net&gt;

I am in boston as well my 78 westy gets covered in 2 tarps. one to protect the bottom one from uv, which rots tarps really fast and the bottom one is the one that stays water proof.   this is not great for the paint but id rather my paint go then have rust issues.(Im going to repaint it once i get body work complete anyway, then ill baby it)   I find it to be an acceptable method i've done this for 3 winters now another option if you want to drop a couple hundred dollars is get one of those supreme bus covers from busdepot or
rmmw they have them specifically for westies and they won't harm the paint but you have to get the expensive one to protect against rain and snow. or get a cheap one to protect the paint and put a tarp over that to protect it form rain snow.
good luck
