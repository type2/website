Nothing will be more functional than the very high spec stock  tires, 
185-R14C, Load Range C or D. If the 14 on the side wall isn't immediately 
followed by a big C, (which stands for 'Commercial', ie sidewalls like on a 
Peterbuilt), it's not spec. These are provided in either load range C or 
load range D. You will find most will try to sell you light truck tires 
that meet the load ratings, but not the commercial rating. Huge info on 
tires in the archives, perhaps one of the largest items for commentary on 
the whole list.

If anyone knows where Continentals in the original spec can be had, I have 
cash for a set. I searched the web for hours several times and never could 
find the commercial rated tires listed anywhere.

Those who remember when they bought a new T-II years ago, what brand of 
tires was it delivered with?? I don't ever recall any other stock tire but 
Continentals on T-II's. I know Pirellis were delivered in that era on many 
of there other models.
