Hi Paul,

U-Haul told me that I would have to disconnect my father's drive shaft
before towing it on their 2-wheel dolly. For $10 more, I rented their
4-wheel 'auto transporter' that eliminated the need to disconnect then
reconnect anything.

Good luck!

&gt; Hello,
&gt; I'm using a tow-dolly to pull my '73 westfalia to a
&gt; bodyman 20 miles away. The engine is out. The man at
&gt; U-Hual told me I'd have to tow her backwards because
&gt; it was bad for the transaxle. Would it matter if I
&gt; towed her forward? If I towed her backward, would the
&gt; steering wheel lock be sufficient, or should I tie the
&gt; wheel still or use the club? I appreciate everyone.
&gt;                                    -Paul Deatherage
