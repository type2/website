Subject: Re: 6/12 volt generator pulley sizes

I have a pulley that I think came off a 25HP bug (1949). I'm pretty
sure it's smaller than the one on my 63 bus (42HP engine).

not only are 25hp pulleys bigger in diameter than 40hp/1600 pulleys, they are
flimsier and wider, as the 25hp  used a wider fan belt.   (also, the
corresponding gen pulley is for a wider belt)
