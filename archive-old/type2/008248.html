&gt; My real question is, why did the noise start now?...all I did to
adjust the
&gt; torsion bars was to remove the shocks, unbolt the brake line, unbolt
the hub
&gt; assembly from the spring plate - do the spline thing, and put
everything
&gt; back together....any ideas, anyone...if I had a worn CV joint, would
it only
&gt; make thumping noise in a turn like this, or would it thump any time
when
&gt; power was applied??...also, if you get off the power in a RH turn, the
&gt; thumping quits...and it doesn't thump in a LH turn or straight
ahead, except
&gt; for the vibration mentioned above...any suggestions would be greatly
&gt; accepted from the many experts out there that may have run into
similar
&gt; symptoms...thanks.

If you moved the plates a full spline then you probably have the rear
end adjusted too high.  This can run the CV joints at too much of an
angle which will cause the problem you described.

You would be well advised to redo the spring plate adjustment, setting
the plates to the correct angle by moving both the inside and outside
splines.  The Bentley book has a nice procedure for this.

BTW, on a loaf bus, you _shouldn't_ be able to see the horizon in the
inside rear view mirror.  If you can see it, the rear end is too high!
