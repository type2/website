Subject: Re: [T2] Stripped Allen Head bolts (complete version)

&gt; Quite often the problem with allen wrenches and socket
&gt; head bolts is that the allen wrench was unable to
&gt; reach very deep into the socket due to debris in the
&gt; hole. There could still be enough good surface at the
&gt; bottom of the hole... Prob #2 is that most allen
&gt; wrenches are slightly chamfered on the ends...
&gt; 
&gt; 
Especially those pesky bolts holdin' the CV's on...I use
an old nut pick and even a little compressed air to clean
out those holes...I've had to resort to the vise grips too
often in the past...;-(
