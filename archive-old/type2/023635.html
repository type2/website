 hello
 
  A few people told me that there is no difference between a middle seat from
 a baywindows and a split windows bus ??
 
 in fact im lookin for a middle seat and they told me its the same as they
 are identical !!  im a bit suspicious about this, what are youre opinions
 ...??

no they are not.  There are even different versions of middles seats, such as 
through mid 56, then through 60, the 61 only, 62- 66, 67 only, 68-69?, 70-&gt;  
I am not sure about bay windows.  The splitty seats have the grab bar on top. 
 

but what year is your bus?   and do you care if it is a splitty seat or bay, 
is this for a daily driver as you shuttle lots of folks around?   A bay seat 
is usually much cheaper than a splitty seat.     and they are usually 2/3 
style
