&gt; I have used YahmaBond (Yahmaha motorcycle shops have it) with good
sucess. I think your choice works but I have not used it. Google for that
brand and Volkswagen and see what results you get back.

Keep in mind that there are different Yamabonds for different purposes.
Get the right one for sealing ungasketed surfaces without hardening!

It appears that VW de Mexico uses Hylomar for their case join.  The two
Meximotors I have haven't leaked yet, so that might be the way to go.

I would be very careful with this selection.  Pick the wrong stuff and the
next disassembly will be a bear!
