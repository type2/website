Subject: Part number inquiry

Geesh, this new job keeps me too busy!  I just checked to see
when was the last time I read typeII, and it was... a month ago!
Who knows when was the last time I posted anything.

Well, just to let you all know I'm still alive, I was wondering
if someone could help me with part numbers for a couple things
I've been keeping an eye out for, but not finding in catalogs...

1) Alternator cable (starter post to alternator), 78 Type IV.

2) Metal fuel lines for &quot;main fuel ring&quot;, 78 Type IV.

3) Engine stand recomendations for type IV engine?  Preferably
   a floor stand on wheels.

Thanks a lot,
Rodney
