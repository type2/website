&gt; I just got home from working at Scola foreign language
&gt; programing. I saw on DW tv a news report about Porsche
&gt; buying 30% of VW stock to protect it from being bought
&gt; from out of country corperations.  I wonder if now we
&gt; will have to pay Porsche prices for VW parts.

hey wade  I read today that it was only a small percentage there is a german 
law about buying too much  in fact one of the counties in germany has the 
largest share and it was only 18 %  I also heard that VW,Audi(which is owned by 
VW) and Porsche are working together on hybrids   later and have fun  Mark
