Subject: re:  VIN swap (was Jay Leno)

&gt;A swap of VINs and titles between buses -- 76-79
California VINs for 
74-75 VINs from out of state -- is probably
against some kind of law. 

Oh yeah.  Federal felony.  And you WILL get
prosecuted.  Deal drugs or defraud a bank and
you've probably got a 30% chance of actually
getting prosecuted, but I assure you that you
would get prosecuted for this if found out. 

Also, there are MANY places on the vehicle that
have the VIN.  And most cops know of at least a
few of the other places.
