Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Smell

Hiya Matthew,

Number One on the list of usual suspects is the cargo hatch seal.  The 
exhaust trapped at the rear of the Bus at speed enters past a worn out seal and 
contaminates the passenger cabin.  The fix-it?  Simple, just replace the seal.  It 
is kinda spendy though.  I'd definitely recommend chatting with Ron over at 
The Bus Depot before you do any seal buying.  He'll set you straight and get 
you the right seal.

Been there - done that!
