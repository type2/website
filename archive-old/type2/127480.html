Subject: Test Post (:-)

Not really, but sort of.

As anone who has tried to reach everybus_dot_com or busesofthecorn_dot_com will
know I suffered a catastrophic hard drive failure last Sunday.  Lost
almost everything except the web site files.  Most especially the bloody
configuration files for sendmail and apache, both of whihc were heavily
customized for the virtual domains that I run.  IF this sees the light of
day then I finally have sendmail running correctly (at least for
everybus_dot_com).  Next step is Apache, which is running only the test page
at present and only for everybus_dot_com.  I will post again when the sites
are available.  My apologies to all of yu, especially Chris and Greg.
