I'm trying to pull the engine on my '78 2.0 FI and the engine just won't 
&gt; separate from the tranny.  The right-front engine bolt has to be the 
&gt; culprit.  

You are actually supposed to remove the nuts on the engine side (for the top two).  They are in back of and to the sides of the intake manifold on the FI engines.
