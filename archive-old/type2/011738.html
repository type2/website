&gt;Freebies this week (further delving into stash):

I'm going to make a shameless plug for Nikki's stuff at this moment.

Anyone wanting anything she has, particularly the exhaust parts should
buy without worry.  The stuff she is pulling out of CA yards is for all
practical purposes &quot;new&quot; in an east coast sense.  The stuff I've got
from here, and the stuff I've seen Steve get is simply gorgeous, plus
she can track down a lot of that weird CA crap if you have a CA spec
car that has made it out of CA, or if like me you just wanted a factory
way to mount a couple of O2 sensors.  The fact she's giving away free
side marker lenses is beyond cool to boot.
