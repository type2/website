One notch is too much!  Found this out the hard way!

&gt; Also does the VW vans have large splines on the outside of the torsion
&gt; bar and finer splines on the inside (middle of van) end?

This is so that you can get finer adjustments.  IIRC, the bars have 40
splines on one end and 44 on the other.  Each spline on the 40 spline end
represents 9 degrees of turn, while each spline on the 44 spline end
represents 8.18 degrees.  That means that if you turn the bar one spline
on the 40 spline end, then 1 spline in the opposite direction on the 44
spline end, the net change is 9 - 8.18 = 0.818 degrees.  This amount of
precision is needed to set the angle of the trailing arms within
tolerance.

If you set your trailing arm, resist the urge to &quot;put in a little extra
twist&quot;.  If you set your ride height too high, you will get odd handling
and poor CV, CV boot, and tire wear.
