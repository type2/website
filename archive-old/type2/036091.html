&gt;While I can see that it is much easier to remove an engine
&gt;if the bus is jacked up, has anyone ever done it without jacking?

I always do it without jacking. Because I work in the street, by myself, I find it easiest
to either drop the motor and either, lift push the bus forward to uncover the engine, or
I strip the top end a bit before dropping it. Usually I'll drop it whole with the floor jack,
without jacking up the bus at all. then I work it off the jack and remove the jack. Then
I grab the muffler and drag the motor out on the balancing board that stays with the motor
when I remove the jack. For reassembly I push the motor under the bus, then from underneath
one side I lift the motor while lying on my back next to it, work the floor jack under it, then pull it
back on top of the jack, then jack it up with my foot while holding the motor steady with my hands.

It's a wild scene.
