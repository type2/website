&gt; I just purchased a plug from Ark last week  ( have yet to receive it).
&gt; Looks like he knows what he's doing.
&gt; Whatever you do, don't deal w/ Gordon Hayman of Hayman Motors in Canada.
&gt; He's listed on the Espar page as a recommended dealer



Just a note that some gas heater parts (at least for the BA4 and BA6) are
still available from VW as well (and from us).  For example we sell the
triple relay and glow plug for the BA6.
