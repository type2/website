Subject: Pop top color

Greetings List,

Does anyone know what color a 78 Westfalia poptop was when it was new? Did 
the poptop match the bumpers (L90D)?  Or were they a bright white or not so 
bright white or some other white paint code???

Also any ideas on how much it would cost to have a shop redo the top.  I've 
read the few articles and was thinking of doing all the prep work (cleaning 
and sanding) and then, because I lack a compressor, paint gun, skill beyond 
rattle can, a garage..., taking the top to get the fancy marine paint 
sprayed on rather than me do a brush and roller job.

Any thoughts??
