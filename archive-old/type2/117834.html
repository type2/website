Subject: Re: [T2] '65 new trans-trouble

Billy,

I know it seems stupid, but you *did* put lube back in....

Can you shift with engine off?

2nd and reverse means you are able to *pull* the hockey stick, but not 
apparently *push* it.  You need someone to attempt to gentley go to
1st while you looke...watch those fingers!

I'd call rancho about the leak(assuming you *do* have lube&lt;grin&gt;).

Worst case is having to pull it again and look.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Listees,
&gt; 
&gt; My new transmission is installed, engine running, but extremely difficult to shift into gear.
&gt; 
&gt; I have gotten it into 2nd and R, and moved the bus back and forth, 
but it is no way close to acceptable for driving yet.
&gt; 
&gt; Short synopsis:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Trans: new 12V from rancho. reused my nosecone/hockey stick assembly, 
new rear mounts, reused front. GL4 in the case. I believe we put it in neutral when we installed the nosecone.
&gt; 
&gt; also: have some gear oil leaking on both sides. 
seems to be from the side case seals, not the axle retaining ring, 
but the case itself. The trans is clean on the sides by the retaining ring. 
Only fluid is on very bottom of case at case seal.
&gt; 
&gt; Linkage: unchanged, reused coupler after cleaning it up some. No adjustments at gearshift.
&gt;
