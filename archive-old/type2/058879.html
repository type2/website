Are you absolutely sure it's not the hot-start/rusty starter solenoid
thing? Check the archives to read abundantly about this issue. I was able
to fix our 78, which had the hot start problem, by cleaning all the
contacts on the starter solenoid and banging the solenoid enough to knock
off whatever rust was causing the problem. I know that I'll need to replace
the solenoid at some point, but the problem hasn't repeated since I applied
the hammer treatment (three months ago).
