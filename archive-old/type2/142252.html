Subject: RE: [T2] gasket sealer

They work fine on mine, but I am thinking that they might not be as good on
this bus. It may not even be the gasket, it could be the plug used in the
holes for the vacumm. These carbs have holes in both intakes. I am unable to
determine if it is the base of the intake leaking or the plug. I just figured
since I have to take it off again anyway that I would use some sealer on it to
make sure. It is a very small leak and only noticed by a chance spray of carb
cleaner.
