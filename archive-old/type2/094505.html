The adjusting part on the carbs makes  this is sounding suspiciously 
like a  gasket leak.  check your  base gaskets.  another way to test  
for leaks  that sometimes works on sneaky leaks is to use carb cleaner 
with the little  tube attached.  shoot  specific linkage and gasket 
points  with the liquid.

&gt; Driving
&gt; is okay but it has no power - maxes out at 30-35 MPH and isnt very quick

&gt; my

&gt;
&gt; 	Wits end.  Absolute wits end.  Is it mechanic time ?  Have I

&gt; options? :(
