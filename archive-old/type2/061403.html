Subject: Cam shafts/head rebuild

Follow VW'ers

I'm in the process of pricing out my rebuild of my 72 westy.  I was
doing some price surfing, and catalog digging and I noticed that RMMW
offered a &quot;Reground cam&quot;, and that's all they offered.

What does this mean?  My understanding is cam's need replacing if they
wear is excessive, worn to much.  Also grinding removes material.  So
how can you regrind a cam, removing material, and increase the size to
meet original specs?

Or is this a &quot;cheap&quot;, you get what you pay for, cam replacement.  Price
difference was more than $40

Also does anyone have some trash heads I could have, preferably 1.7L.  I
read Bob's sermon about head rebuilds and would like to try doing mine.
However, I'd like to learn the process on some trash heads to get a feel
for what is involved.

I'd pay for shipping and  be happy to throw a couple of bucks your way
for the effort.

Thanks
Brent
