Subject: Re: [T2] FI vs Carb question

Keep that pancake - bet your friend will want it back when he realizes that 
his bus is REALLY slow with a Type I.



&gt;A friend of mine just gave me his 2000cc FI engine from his 78.  He had 
&gt;taken his bus into the shop because it was running rough and not idling 
&gt;well.  The mechanic said (presumably after some investigation, probably 
&gt;not much though) that it had FI problems that would take at least $300 to 
&gt;fix, probably more, he also thought there was &quot;something with a valve&quot; and 
&gt;that it was running on 3 cylinders.  So he talks my friend into putting a 
&gt;1600 type I in his bus for $850 (my friend is a newbie and has owned a VW 
&gt;only a few months.)  The mechanic also stated that he doesn't like to work 
&gt;on pancake engines.
