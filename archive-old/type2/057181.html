Subject: When injectors won't ground:

To Sean and list:

Reading of the guy with the apparent bad ecu not grounding the injectors-
just some silly ideas to get the damn bus somewhere in an emergency and
avoid the tow:....1.- since it seemed to run a bit while cold start valve
was working, couldn't one make it fire all the time (the fuel sweeps in
when head valve opens), and you could limp along at the right throttle
opening, using the clutch to control your speed?,   2. Ground injectors  on
purpose, and reroute the distributor wire  and let the positive pulses from
the dist. fire them- yes it could be very rich or lean but I bet you could
set the throttle to a constant rpm at a point where it balances the gas and
runs (continuously- and then use the clutch aand gears to limp along!  3.
Another thought was to be able to fiddle with the fuel pressure (make it
very low by clamping the line) and try to balance it with the right air
intake as above.
   Any thoughts or other ideas?
