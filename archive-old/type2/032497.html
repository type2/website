Subject: First time non-greeting from ACVW

Well, it's friday, so I guess I'm alright to ramble here for a spell.  This past Wednesday, I was cruising down Rt. 68 in Xenia, Ohio in my '66 Camper.  A buddy of mine was driving right behind me in my '83 Vanagon. We were returning from a rock-climbing trip in Clifton Gorge where we took a bunch of teen-agers from the YMCA teen camp.  Right outside of town, I see a nice blue and white bay window coming at me, nice bus.  So, of course I give a big, nice, friendly wave out the window.  I get NOTHING from the bay window driver.  I look in my rear-view and my buddy driving the Vanagon does the same as me, gives a big friendly greeting.  Again, NOTHING from the driver of the bay window! So, WTF?!?!?  This is the first time EVER that I have been in my bus and NOT gotten a wave from another passing bus driver.  Here in Ohio, air cooled buses are few and far between, and when I see another one on the road I get very excited. It's kinda like being told &quot;Hey, you're not alone out ther!
!
e!&quot; So, am I the only who feels like this when I see another bus on the road? Tell me there are more people who do... Oh my God, I'm not a freak am I!?!?!?  Wait a minute, don't answer that last question....
