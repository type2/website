Subject: Re: [T2] When Bus Owners Strike Back (window Installation)

Hi,

Got the glass today and got it installed.

I was unable to get the glass in from the top down. I was also unable
to get the new window in with the lifter mechanism in place. Instead I
undid the screw and bolt for the vent window and pulled the top of the
vent window back. This indeed does create an opening by which the
lifter mechanism can be removed as per Bentley. Then I removed the
felt window tracks, loaded the glass into the door through the lower
opening, reinstalled the lifter mechanism, reinstalled the vent
window, reinstalled the felt tracks and inner window scraper,
reattached all the necessary bolts and I'm ready to roll.

Mario, I will get that check to cover the shipping costs out to you
tomorrow in the AM. THANK YOU!!

And to the loyal and tireless listees, thanks for all your help. You
folks are the best of the best.



peace

&gt; Hey Jules
&gt;      The glass went out this morning, all you should  have to do is remove
&gt; the 10mm bolt that holds the vent frame next to the winder  and the screw at
the
&gt; top, and remove the channel felt. after this you should be  able to slide
the
&gt; glass from the top and let it slide to the bottom of the door  then put the
&gt; vent frame back and the felt.
&gt;
&gt; I removed it in the dork last night in about 15 min so its not to hard to
&gt; reinstall.
