Subject: Front bearing question...Thanks to all who responded

A big thanks to all who responded to my questions two weeks ago
concerning my front wheel bearing job. Richard's tips about finding the
right tools made all the difference during installation of the races.
Thanks also to John Kolak for his answers.
 
My final question. Does anyone know what size e-clip goes on the speedo
cable to keep it from pulling through the hub. Mine was all bent to crap
and looked like it was the wrong size anyways. Stupid 30 cent part
keeping me off the road. 
 
Thanks
Zach
