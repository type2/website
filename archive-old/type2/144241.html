Subject: Re: [T2] Why not to live in pretentious neighborhoods

And the cop showed in 7 minutes?  Too bad.  You live
in the wrong neighborhood sir.
   
Not to brag, but I can, and have shot off several
rounds from a pistol into the back 10 acres, and have
never heard a complaint.  The sound from the discharge
reverberates around the entire valley.  In-fact,
during some target practice from the deck, sometimes
the other neighbors respond to the challenge and
pinch-off 10 or 20 rounds just for the fun of it.
   
But at the same time, when an elderly neighbor fell
and injured her hip this last spring, a ranch-hand
called 1 or 2 neighbors, and the whole valley
showed-up to help her.  Including me.  I would guess
an elderly lady laying in the street in your
neighborhood, would not get immediate help.
   
My 78 ASI/Riviera has a loud EMPI muffler.  It sounds
studly.  The whole valley probably knows when I fire
it up.  
    
Perhaps its time for you to install a &quot;stinger&quot;
muffler on your T2?  Oh, I guess that would not work
out.  Stinger mufflers are not street legal.  But it
doesn't stop me from dreaming-up devious bus noise
making techniques.   And of course, you would need to
turn your stinger-equipped bus ignition off at 9:59:59
PM.

&gt; We got some
&gt; complaints. Here in this county we have noise
&gt; abatement laws and you
&gt; can't make noise after 10pm.&quot;
