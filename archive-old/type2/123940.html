Subject: [T2] Fuel Injectors


&gt;Stock '79 2.0L WITH CALIFORNIA EMISSIONS.  This means that there is no 
&gt;.resistor block for the injectors.  Are these injectors the same (i.e. 
&gt;same part number) as the '75-78  injectors that use the resistor block?

&gt;Can anybody recommend a place to purchase new ones?  I read awhile back

&gt;that Autozone carried these for like $35.  Is this true and do these 
&gt;work well?
