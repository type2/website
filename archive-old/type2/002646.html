I had a similar experience with the oil from the transaxle/engine junction.
Is the oil the tell tale gear oil, does it smell bad? With mine the rear
transaxle seal went out, the seal directly behind the throw out bearing on
the clutch arm. I drove mine from Macon Georgia to Clearwater Florida, but I
had to remove the plug from the side of the transaxle and pump new gear oil
in everytime I stopped for gas. The oil would only pour out when it was hot
and the engine stopped. I guess the &quot;splash&quot; lubrication style of the
gearbox kept the level low enough only to spill when it came to a stop. Just
thought it might be of some help.
by the way if anyone knows the actual VW name of that seal, or maybe a part
number, it would be greatly appreciated. Once again, its the seal around
what I believe is the main input shaft of the transaxle, directly behind the
throw out bearing looking at the clutch assembly with the motor pulled.
Thanks!!
