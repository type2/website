-  Deadline for T-shirt orders is July 1.  I will hold off a few days, due 
to the mail delays around the July 4th holiday.  I will be giving the order 
to the printer on July 10th..so that is the absolute last date to get your 
order in:   link to shirt order form:

- VW FAMILY FEUD:  I sent out the survey to the list last week, and would 
like to thank those who responded.  But, we only received 40 responses and 
we need at least 100 bus owners to survey!  Please do not re-submit you 
answers, but if you did not submit your survey last week please click this 
link and follow the instructions:

- POT LUCK/Chicken Wing Cook-Off:   Make em' hot, make em' not just make em! 
  Submit your special recipe to the panel of judges.  We will also have a 
POT LUCK SUPPER:  If your not cooking Wings - Please bring any dish or 
anything that would go well with wings - celery, chips, bread, veggies, etc. 
There will be a lot of people so we'll all need to pitch in to feed the 
masses.

the link to goto the &quot;grocery list&quot; and see what you can bring to help us

  There will be some super prizes......to be announced soon.  Special thanks 
to Rod &quot;calander&quot; and Wild Bill for helping to run the raffle

-  CARABUS:   If you want to lead or get into a carabus from your area to 
HCBF, please email me off list.  I will set-up a database of carabus lists 
on the webpage.

Most of the other information can be found on the web site:
I just updated the webpage and schedule of events last night.  We now have 2 
bands scheduled to play on Saturday, a tech class, a hot wing cook-off not 
to mention the VW Family Feud and a flurry of other activities.  Be sure to 
check the schedule section of the web page for all the details.
