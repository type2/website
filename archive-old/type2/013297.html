Guess I need to through my thoughts in here.

1.  Because of work schedules and school, my family does a fair amount of
camping in the summer. Here in west Texas the night time temps stay
around 90 degrees. If I want my wife and kids to go camping, there will
be AC. There will also be running water, hot showers and electricity
available, so no generator worries here.

2. It is rare to see anyone without AC around here unless they are in a
tent.  Even the pop-up campers have AC.  I have yet to here one so loud
it bothered me in my campsite.
Ask the folks down on the Gulf Coast about camping in the summer.

3. What you think is silly, others feel is absolutely necessary.  God
made us all different, thats what makes life so interesting.

My Westy presently has no AC on it.  My family has not camped in it
during the hot weather either

&gt; Dear listfolk,
&gt; 
&gt; I've been following all the air conditioner banter and just couldn't 
&gt; hold back
&gt; any longer. Forgive me.
&gt; 
&gt; VW buses, even Riverias, Adventurewagens, and Sambas or whatever are 
&gt; small things. 
&gt; They hard-shell tents, not RVs.
&gt; 
&gt; Most VW Bus drivers I know enjoy the outdoors and (gasp) actually 
&gt; expand their cramped 
&gt; bus quarters by making the great outdoors their family room.
&gt; 
&gt; Generators are incredibly unpopular, noisy, inefficient and smelly 
&gt; things--solar
&gt; options making them more so. Yes, I'm even talking about the new 
&gt; top-of-the-line 
&gt; Honda$. 
&gt; 
&gt; Besides, most campgrounds have rules that prohibit running 
&gt; generators  between 
&gt; 10 P.M. and 8 A.M.
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, you plug it in at the campground. Well, I for one don't want to 
&gt; be within 100 yards 
&gt; of you listening to it all friggin' night. I personally prefer 
&gt; hearing the night stillness 
&gt; pierced by a hooting owl or love-struck mockingbird. It is also nice 
&gt; to hear things approaching.
&gt; 
&gt; May I suggest either camping where evenings cool down and lying 
&gt; still, or getting a small 
&gt; fan and opening your screened windows.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course you could also sell the VW and buy a 35-foot Bounder RV, 
&gt; or get a hotel for the night.
&gt; 
&gt; Air conditioning a little VW bus is about the silliest 
&gt; excess-baggage idea I've seen cross 
&gt; this list since I subscribed. There. I said it and I'm glad.
