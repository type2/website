Hi.
Been lurking around here for a year or two now, and passively picked up a lot of damned good information and advice, like some mutant sea anemone filtering the best bits from the wash. Keep it up; you're all doing a fine job.
Unfortunately company policy now DEMANDS that I delete all &quot;non-business&quot; email immediately upon receipt, no doubt followed by public flogging.
But I'm not here to stand on a soapbox; I may be back using my home email soon.

Bus content: Does anyone know ehre I can get the small &quot;Danbury Conversions&quot; tailgate badge from? Mine was stolen some time ago and there's something distinctly missing without it. Any info, please p-mail me (at home) on tim.g_at_zetnet.co_dot_uk

Thanks,
Tim ('77 Danbury)
