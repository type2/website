Subject: Re: resurrection (friday)

I know exactly where your coming from Dave.
Having both an R100RT and R50 (1955 model) I know the joy of a good air cooled
boxer with only two wheels.
The R100 was Daily transport for many years, first for my Dad, then my Brother
and then me. The R50 is a very good, low miles unrestored bike which is taken
out on irregular outings by the three of us. Both are now sitting unused (but
not forgotten) at My Dad's place.
Due to various reasons it's been almost 2 years since I've ridden either, the
leathers and helmet tucked away gathering dust, so I await a similar
experience some time in the near future!!
Enjoy the old BMW, just like a good kombi, made to be used :-)
