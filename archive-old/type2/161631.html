Ahhhh yes, it is the journey not the destination. The State Fair will be
going on in Raleigh until 10/22. Take the back roads use the old bridge
across the Cape Fear where you can see a birds eye view of the USS North
Carolina and come on up that way instead of using I40, very pretty drive
and you get to go through Spivey's Corner home of the US Hollering
Contest, if you want to come to the fair pmail me, you can park at my
office one block from the fairgrounds. Then I would take US64 west out
of Raleigh, again avoiding the interstates, you get to cross Jordan
Lake, the Haw, Deep, and Rocky Rivers, you'll pass through Siler City
(where Barney goes to party), Asheboro, Lexington (BBQ nexus of the US
east of the Appalachians), and hmmm.... I'm sorry where did you say you
needed to go :)

So, you went out and checked and found the distance from Wilmington NC
to Linville NC is 320 miles ! ! ! Don't forget that he may want to
return, too... Or is a round trip not in the expectations of the type 2
community.

I know it's an 'adventure' and many stops are not preplanned, but hey, I
need to get back to where my social security check is delivered.

OK, according to Yahoo, the run is 320 miles and 7 hours 10 minutes, but
Mapquest gives a different route, with more miles (368) but less time
(6h

3m)

There must be a third option that would take the scenic route, something
avoiding major highways (75 mph!! Man, I only saw that once, and it was
down hill with a tail wind and just after my quadrennial tune up. Just
before my left rear thread separated from the casing...)
