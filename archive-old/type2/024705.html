Hi all,

I am SO happy to say that I am able to afford to get my '78 Riviera back on the road!!  It has been 4 months since the alternator blew, so I cannot wait =)  Here's the deal:

I know I need a new alternator and two new batteries (others are shot).  I also need a left-rear wheel hub as the threads are stripped badly from the wheel falling off (long story-short: all 5 lug nuts backed their way off the threads ;O)  Also, I need them to cut off my exhaust corner piece (as it has rusted on) and replace it with a new one I have.  Anything else I should have them check since it has been sitting for the last 4 months?  Was in really solid running condition before the alt. went.  Most major seals were replaced then. (I worry about the &quot;minor ones&quot;).  I know it is hard to make judgment calls without seeing the bus first hand, but I'll take anything I can get!

Tack on 4 new tires (quoted $270 from Les Schwab for the &quot;heavy-duty ones required for the heavier campers&quot; - is this true?), and I am in business. Think it is realistic I can get the hub, batteries and alt. replaced for $330 or am I living in a fantasy world? Now, I'd like to do the alternator at home, but I am without a garage and living on a muddy, busy street and do not have a dry, clean space to work.  

I have gone through the phone book and gotten a couple of names so far.  I wanted to throw these out there and get some comments from any listee's who may have used any of the folks below...just looking for the best price/solid work/other comments.

Here are the shops:  I'd appreciate if anyone can add in hourly rates, etc.:

Always V-Dub
Trafton &amp; Maier Foreign Auto: 253-4621
Thiemann &amp; Heckmann: 282-0767
Pacific West Imports (www.pwipdx_dot_com)
German Auto Salvage (www.germanautosalvage_dot_com) Boring, OR 


Thanks to the dedicated folks who keep this a valuable resource.  Hopefully one day I'll be able to contribute more than just questions.  ;O)
