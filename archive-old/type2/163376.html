Subject: Re: [T2] California replacement title

Barry -

Go to this California DMV Link (Acrobat Required):

http://www.dmv_dot_ca_dot_gov/forms/reg/reg227.pdf

Print or download this form.  This form is used to request a duplicate title
and/or allow the proper transfer of the vehicle (at least within California
and some states).  Your friend will have to take this form to the Virgina
DMV to see if it will be acceptable as a substitute (most states do) for
actual title transfer.  Check also to see if the form will have to be
notarized locally.

If the Virginia DMV won't accept the form, then your friend will have to
mail it with the proper payment and (IMPORTANT) the return address to mail
the title (still commonly called the &quot;pink slip&quot;, but they haven't been pink
for over a decade now).  To contact the Calif DMV call (800)777-0133 if your
friend has other questions or go to:
