&gt; we think was a gauge wire grounding out. Either one will kill the motor

Which gauge?  I wouldn't think that's kill the radio too.

&gt; dead dead dead. A short to ground should explain the accessories, too. Any

I checked the battery connections and they seem fine.  Plus, it cut out
while it wwas running, in which case we can rule out the battery, since
you can basically pull the postive terminal off the battery and the car
will still run.

Thanks,
