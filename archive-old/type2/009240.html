&gt; &gt; Hey Y'all
&gt; &gt; I have an Auto trans from a 73 Bus complete still installed in the
&gt; bus
&gt; &gt; for sale. I want $150 OBO. It is good and I drove the Bus, but the
&gt; &gt; engine ran realy bad so I am parting the bus out.
&gt; 
&gt; Why not just patch the engine back together? What made it run poorly?
&gt; If
&gt; the bus isn't severely rusted out, don't kill it for parts...

I know that this sound crazy to part out a bus that the engine is bad,
but around this area busses are fairly cheap. The body on this bus is
real good and solid. All it needs is an engine rebuild to make run. It
also needs front brakes and a headliner, but I have had it for sale for
$300 and have had no takers. I even had a guy offer $250 and said I
would take it and he never showed up.  I need to get it out of my yard,
I have a real nice '77 and need the money and the space. I would love
to sell it whole, but I need to get it out of here. I will keep the
engine as a back-up and rebuild it someday if I don't get any good
offers on it.
