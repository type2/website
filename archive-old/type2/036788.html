Subject: Power at RPM

I'm having the same problem w/my 69 bus. I've narrowed it down to either gas
or spark : )
I switched back to an older carb, no change.I replaced the points(.016&quot;,
25/50deg),cap and condenser...no change. I replaced the spark plug
wires...slight improvement(it's drivable now). The spark straight off the
coil is bright white , I replaced it 6 months ago.

I had my timing light set up and as I got the RPM's up the light became
intermittent just as the engine began to run rougher.

I've got very little hill climing power, my acceleraion on a hill is pretty
much 0 where normally I could at least peak out 3rd gear.

Could it be the voltage regulator? What else haven't I checked???? I want my
power back!!
