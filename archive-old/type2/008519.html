Subject: RE: More brake booster stuff
X-Sun-Charset: US-ASCII

	Discs will be the better bet if you work the brakes really
hard- VW weren't just killing time when they engineered the upgrade,
discs are better brakes. That said, a bus driver already has to plan
ahead for acceleration, planning deceleration shouldn't be that
much more burden :) 

	And remember, the California Mille Miglia is open to cars
with drum brakes only. Maybe we can take our truck some year :)

	We've got a '71 beam that came with our '70 and would give it away
if I could dig down to it :( which I haven't had time to do.
The one and only problem I see with the conversion is that you
have to change the rear brake parts too or you wind up needing two
spare tires. I've no cus against 'mongrels' - if you have time
to do all four wheels the upgrade is worth it. I just point out
that there's more to it than the front beam, unless you already care
multiple spare tires.
