&gt; These places never cease to amaze the heck out of me--how do they stay

Because most people don't associate the problem they cause with the oil
change, or the damage doesn't become apparent until the next time they get
the oil changed 7500 miles later by which time they have forgotten where
they took it the previous time.

&gt; &gt; The tale of all tales is the new bugs require 15 / 50---or 15 / 40.
&gt; The idiots that buy them don't read the book--take the car to an oil
&gt; change specialist--and get 10/30--

The &quot;technician&quot; is making $6 per hour.  Do you think they really care
which nozzle they grab to fill up the engine?  As long as the car makes it
down the street afterwards, their standards are met!

&gt; The first thing they do is bring the car back to VW and want to know why
&gt; their engine is rattling---VW service writer first thing asked them if
&gt; they had their oil just changed somewhere --besides there.

OTOH, Dealers are no guarantee of quality.  A friend had his Toyota
serviced at the dealer and when he got home found no oil on the dipstick.
Took the car back to the dealer and found that there was only 1.5 quarts
in the 5-quart sump.  Seems that their automatic filling nozzle had
malfunctioned and dispensed only 1.5 quarts no matter what the dial said.

The scariest thing was their attitude:  &quot;Yeah, it does that now and
then...&quot;
