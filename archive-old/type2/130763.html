&gt;&gt; Does anyone have a shop in Oakland they can recommend
&gt;&gt; I take it to? One I can trust?

I'll second that.  Steve and Marco are great guys and do quality work.  
They're on Blake, near the intersection with Shattuck.  Easy to get to 
from the Coliseum.  Take 880 North to 80 East, take the Ashby exit, 
turn left on Adaline (sp? .. anyway, the BART station will be on your 
left when you're at the correct intersection).  Turn left again onto 
Shattuck, go a few blocks, turn left onto Blake.
