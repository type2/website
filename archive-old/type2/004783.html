&gt;Q.1 The filler hose is apparently visible if the round plate at the right
&gt;hand side of the engine compartment is removed.  I cannot see any screws or
&gt;anything holding it on so I am assuming that it is a matter of levering it
&gt;off,  but before I do that I'd like some-one to confirm that is the case so
&gt;I don't finish up forcing something.  (Any ideas about repair access /
&gt;techniques if required,  please).

Yes it just levers off rather like the lid on a paint tin

&gt;Q.2 Concerns the plate between the engine compartment and the tank.  I want
&gt;to take this off so I can see the tank.  It is held on with screws round
the
&gt;edge but having taken all these out, it is still held in quite firmly.
&gt;Again I don't want to force it out if I've missed something that needs
&gt;undoing.  Does anyone have experience of this please.


My van has only 6 screws but others tell me there are some screws on the
bottom edge as well on some models.

&gt;Q.3.  How many actual exit  points are there from the tank. You know -
&gt;vents, outlets, etc. and are they all visible if I manage to get that
plate
&gt;off.


As I seem to remember there are 2 vent pipes at the top. These are connected
with flexible plastic pipe Also on top is the sender unit for the fuel
gauge. The filler is on the top right hand side and connects to the inlet
pipe with a piece of rubber hose and 2 jubilee clips. Then on the bottom is
the outlet. This seems to vary by model and some have removable filters. My
79 has nothing removable, but a cartridge filter down the fuel pipe.

&gt;Also, while I'm on the subject of vents - I have noticed recently that
there
&gt;often seems to be a smell of fuel coming from the ...(searches for the
&gt;correct term) ..well vents really.  Those slatted sections at the back
&gt;corners, at the top.  I've being trying to get a clear picture in my mind
of
&gt;exactly what leads where but  I'm finding it very difficult. I suppose
&gt;everywhere has different emissions  laws leading to different layouts in
&gt;this area of the van.  Mine is for the British  market if that's any help.
&gt;

I'm not too sure what happens here. It looks like the tank vent pipes -
thats the ones which are about 1/4 inch in diameter  lead out and up to the
slatted air intake vents. They then have a fat section and then go back to
thin and turn back into the engine compartment and connect to the air filter
on the carbs. So is this system intact and unblocked? Can't really help on
this last point, though if you've got a generally smelly engine, it's likely
on idle for fumes to get out via the air intakes, whereas when the engine is
turning faster the air flow will mostly be inwards, so you wont get this.
Sometimes a good steam clean can cure this, assuming there's no actual fuel
leaking.

Be really careful. Take no chances. I've already related the story of the
camper enthusiast in our village who died after a camper fire. What he did
it seems was to try and put out a fire once it had got started rather than
get the hell away, and it blew up on him.
