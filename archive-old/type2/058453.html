Subject: Riviera Sink Drainage: Please Educate

Howdo --
This goes out to any Riviera owners out there with the sink/water
tank/city-water camper setup.  For my 79, I'm having a hard time figuring
out where the water is supposed to drain out once it goes down the sink's
drain.  There doesn't seem to be another outside drainage hose like the
vertical one that exists for the &quot;potable&quot; water tank.  I got into the sink
cabinet to take a look, and found a level hose going from the bottom of the
drain to an opening on the side of the bus; however, this opening is what I
assumed to be the &quot;City Water Inlet&quot; and therefore also assumed water comes
IN here -- not out.  (Actually there are 2 openings out there:  the one the
drain hose goes to is unmarked but has a removable plastic cap, and the
other -- which actually has the &quot;City Water Inlet&quot; label above it -- also
has a loose but seemingly-unremovable garden-hose-like cap on it and says
&quot;Pressure Regulator&quot; on the actual fixture.)  Do any of you Riviera-ers
have this configuration and if so, can you explain how this is all meant to
work?  Does water somehow go IN the &quot;City Water&quot; location and come OUT the
other opening from the drain?  It just seems like the drainage should exit
downward using a little gravity, not straight out to the side...  Anyway,
the bus came with a plastic accordion-like hose (which I used to fill the
potable water tank) as well as a 2-ft. piece of garden hose with a screw-on
at one end and just sliced off at the other (which I haven't found a use
for yet).  Thanks in advance once again, everyone.
