&gt; I did mine myself. Maaco might have been cheaper; maybe even
&gt; better. A lot of work...mostly in prep (which Maaco probably
&gt; won't do anyway).

&gt; If you do it, don't expect to get it right the first time...and
&gt; learn what to do to make it right (prep coats, etc.). You
&gt; probably can't do a good job for under $400 when you consider
&gt; undercoats, primer, paint, etc.

BTDT.  Joe's $400 is low in my opinion.  Those of you in NEATO,
may have read my account of restoring a '67 Deluxe.  I put $350
in paint alone (with a &quot;brother-in-law works there&quot; discount).
That does not include, as Joe rightly points out as &quot;prep costs&quot;.

Filler, sandpaper, grinding discs, primer, surfacer, sealer,
hardeners, putty, solvents, tack cloth, visqueen, gun cleaner,
etc. etc. etc.  This covers most of it *if you are going to do it
right*.  Certainly the Maaco approach can provide some salvation
for the person who doesn't have the facilities.  The recurring
theme in my dissertation on painting I stole from a paint
company:

Prepare the surface, insure the result.

Painting over crap is like building a house in a swamp.  It will
look good for a while.  It's up to you to determine how long you
want that *while* to be.

My approach was slow and easy.  I did all prep work, applied a
coat of color-coat and let it sit all winter without trying to
assemble anything.  I figured that if *anything* looked bad the
next spring I had not done some prep correctly.  The next spring
I then wet sanded the color coat and applied a final coat.  Four
years later I have one small bubble on the nose and one in a
rocker but the rest of the bus still looks great.

I have no fancy equipment.  I painted in a barn-literally.  I
also educated myself by enrolling in some auto-body courses at
the local community college before taking on the &quot;hard&quot; part.
The more you learn up-front, the less you have to re-do.
