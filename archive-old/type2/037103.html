The bus was heading due South through gusty winds that knocked it about like
a kitten batting a ball across the floor. I was trying to beat the Sun but
the white knuckle express could only maintain a cruising speed of 50mph
against the gusts. As six o'clock approached the 4 lane highway choked down
to two and a line of annoyed motorists filed in behind the bus for the last
12 miles into rural Rockingham Co.

The rains began as I turned off Hwy 220 on to 73 and I could feel the
collective sigh of releif from the line of people in a hurry but were stuck
behind me. The directions were in my head but I really did not know where I
was going or looking for. Fortunately Jennifer had made some signs and grin
appeared on my face every time I passed a big blue and yellow \X/ on the
side of the lonesome two lane black top.

The rains became heavier as the raod ran along the crest of ridge of the
once mighty Uwharreies. I was so taken by the beauty of the view that I blew
right by the last turn sign. No problem though; I just turned off on a
logging road, did a three point turn that would make any driving instuctor
blush and corrected my course.

It wasn't long after getting back on the right track that I found the last
sign that marked the turn into Travis's woodsy hideaway. Past the agro gate
and a quarter mile down the dirt road I spied a lonely flip top Westy parked
in front of a house with a tin roof that looked out upon 200 acres of
managed logging land.

Travis is a tree freak in the nicest sense of the term. He is finishing his
degree in forestry the May and will talk you ear off about anything having
to do with trees. He passion and knowlegde for the forest is unsurpased by
any bus drivers love for their bus. That is love!

One last sign by the house pointed into the woods so I quickly turned left
amongst the trees and began a decent on a raod that had been cut with a
bulldozer just a week or so ago. I snaked down past a drip burn patch and
into the woods for a bumpy but fun ride. After several hundered yards I came
out into a clearing that was nestled in the turn of river( actually a stream
that feeds the mighty Pee Dee.

The rain had stopped and I had not even noticed as I appraoched the first
buses. At the end of the trail a  pitfire was burning nicely and John had
just finished putting up a 20x20' shelter of poles and tarp. More rain was
forcast for the evening to be accompanied by strong winds, lightning and
thunder. The threat of severe weather had kept many away but those who
braved  and endured natures less tender side were richer for it.

Three generations of buses were present. John and his family arrived in the
'61 crew cab. Jen and Travis in the '65 deluxe, Matt in the '70 hardtop
Westy( You may remember Matt as the listmember with and exhaust leak that
caused him to take a mythical voyage to the Moon:)  me in the '72 westfakia
and a nice couple in a mid 80s Vanagon Westy. Also present was Erik who had
forsaken the Westy and the his ubiquitos thing in favor of his newest
pasion: The Styer-Puch Pinzgauer.

What a beast it is. The  Pinzgauer is an Austrian built Swiss military
Transport. This particular vehicle was built in 1972 and sports an aircooled
inline 4, fully locking differentails and monster gear reductions boxes on
each wheel that make a Hummer look silly. The Pinz could climb a tree if it
did not crush it first.

Greetings were exchanged as I surveyed the area for a campsite. I decided
that close to the fire and the shelter was a good chaice considering the
fury about to be unleahsed upon us.

Next order of business was to find a botte opener the release the Newcastle
from its glassy bodage. Having accomplished that I pulled a chair out of the
Westfakia and camp was officially set up.

Donna  was nice enough to make enough burgers and potato salad to feed
anybody who was hungry and we all were! After dinner we gathered around the
campfire and did what we all do best: drink beer and talk about VWs with
occasion references thrown in to other mundane activities. Then the rains
came.

The rest of the evening was spent between running back and forth from the
shelter( thanks to John for his civic minded foresight) to the fire as the
storms came and went. We each fought a personal battle between warm and wet
by the fire and cold and very slowly drying off under the shelter. The
results were mixed but eventually the stars replaced the clouds and warm and
dry saved the evening!

After many beers and tales of buses, kids, tress and working for the man it
was suddenly 2:00 AM. We said goodnight and crawled back to our buses for a
deep sleep only to be awaked by the kiss of the sweet morning Sun.

I was awoken by my cruel and unforgiving bladder 7:00. After binding
arbitration it was decided that I would get of the bus and provide relief. I
wandered past the fire and on to the rivebank which had been covered in
darkness the evening before and I was awestruck at its quiet beauty. I stood
silently as I watched the current move past the bluff and on to the sea 200
miles away. I daydreamed about the Schwimmwagen that Erik told me was in
opereation just a few miles from our homes back in Greensboro. Could it be
done? Could a Schwimmwagen negotiate the gentle river all the way to
Charleston? I was distracted by the thought of Orange Juice and donaughts
that were awaiting me back at the bus.

I packed up the bus and hit the raod early so I could get back home and see
Michele and the kids. They are coming on the next trip and I cant wait !
