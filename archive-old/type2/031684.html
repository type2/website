yeah always check the work if possible before signing off on it.  some
years ago I bought a 71 bus new from the dealer, it had been used as a
dealer service van so it had a few miles on it,  well before I picked it
up the VW Dealership did a full service on it,... got it and drove 14
miles when the engine siezed..._dot_dealer forgot to put oil in it... I got a
NEW engine out of the deal but really should have pulled the dipstick
