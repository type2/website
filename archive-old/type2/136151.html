Subject: Re:  Spare Tire Cover

&gt;Does anyone know of an inexpensive tire cover
for the spare when it's on the front of the bus? 

Mine is from Bus Depot.  $14.95 is pretty cheap. 
They have black and white.

It seems to have increased my horsepower and gas
mileage by at least 10%.  Handling is also
greatly improved.  :)
