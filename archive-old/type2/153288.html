Subject: Re: [T2] Weird starter solenoid

Old volks said: If not needed on your application, just ignore it.

I wish I could just ignore it.For whatever reason my bus has this solenoid
and uses the extra terminal.The problem is that I cannot locate a
replacement solenoid with the extra terminal.If you have these available
please let me know.If I didnt need the extra terminal I sure wouldnt be
worried about it.
