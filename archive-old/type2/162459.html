&gt; I need a right front door for my '78.

help me get my spare on (I had to get it from Boston area) and you can
have my messed up one.
&gt;
&gt; Any Northern Virginia or Baltimore MD or Washingto DC people know of any
&gt; available??  Have any late bays been sighted in Crazy Rays??

haven't seen any at the Erdman ave location, but they are sometimes hard
to spot from the street.   there is a whole bus avaliable up here though
from another guy, not sure what he wants for it haven't been able to
catch up with the owner.
