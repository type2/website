Subject: Mice &amp; damage

I've seen a couple of postings lately warning of mouse nests under the
engine cooling tin.  I'd like to add that the oil cooler should be
double-checked too.  I took an engine out last week that died because of
a lot of mouse nest stuff clogging up the top surface of the oil cooler
and lots of the fins on the cylinders.  I guess this points out the
importance of an oil temp and/or cylinder head temperature gauge.

I really don't have any good tricks for keeping a vehicle mouse-free
over an extended period of storage.
