Think Yamabond 4. Non drying, available at local Yamaha shops. Used to seal
japanese motorcycle cases and when was the last time you saw one of those
leak! fwiw the local Porsche guys used to buy it from us, I use it on my
cases and also on my pushrod tube openings. No oil leaks and no crush issues

&gt; Indian Head gasket goop. It is a thin dark colored &quot;glue&quot; that an old
&gt; mechanic I knew swore by. You can still get it - different brands and
names.
&gt;
&gt; It acts like a sealant and a light glue and I have taken to applying it to
&gt; everything including the seating surface of crank and shaft seals.
&gt;
&gt; Can't hurt and I think (THINK) it keeps my motors a little bit drier. You
&gt; can also apply it to studs and such...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Chris,
&gt; &gt;         I have the seals already (From Busted Bus, thanks Joe!).  Here
&gt; &gt;is the list of parts that I already have.  I am going to do the both the
&gt; &gt;seals for the engine and tranny while  at the same time.  Any
&gt; &gt;suggestions to other items that I should have are welcome.  Thanks

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The engine and tranny have to be separated but the engine does not have
&gt; &gt;to
&gt; &gt;come apart if it is the rear main seal (which it sounds like).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;It will simply require engine removal, flywheel and clutch removal.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;New seal - grease it where the seal touches the crankshaft.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Back together.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;You can get this seal from any FLAPS.

&gt; &gt; &gt;I was told by someone that it has to be split to replace either the
&gt; &gt; &gt;main or rear main seal.  Can't remember which one.  I personally do not
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;know what needs to be done.  (I have been reading the engine drop
&gt; &gt; &gt;procedure in Bentley and stuff in the archives and have not run by this
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;either.) If that person is wrong, that would be fine by me.  :)

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Hey Troy - what seal requires the case to be split?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;A can't think of a single seal that requires case splitting.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;By the way the case is the engine block.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Hope you and your wife are doing well.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Ill hold off on the trade for now...:)  One problem is the wife is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;pregnant at near 30 weeks and with possible pre-eclampsia.  So I am
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;not
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;sure that I would be able to get too much out of her right now.  And
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;would not expect much.  I guess the reason that I am so worried is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;one, I don't know how the whole engine works.  I know the concept,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and what a lot the thing do, but the whole picture is far from there.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Cracking that case to replace the seal is also something that I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;really no idea about.  What part is the case?  (Its that bad.)  I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;have new fuel lines and injector seals in route to me right now from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Busted Bus, so that should help out a lot.  They need to be replaced.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;The other thing is that looking through the Bentley, I don't quite
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;have all
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the parts, nor the money to purchase them.  Sucks being the only one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;bringing in the income.  Like I said though, if I have to I will try
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and do it myself.  (Would just be much more comfortable with extra
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;experience hanging around.)  Thanks...I'll let ya know how it goes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or at someone elses.  The situation that I am in leaves me to try
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and do this on a weekend because it is my only mode of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; transportation. However, the bus will not make it much longer the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; way that it is and this needs to be done soon.  I am determined to
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get this done and if worse comes to worse, I will drop it at my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; house by myself.  (Knowing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Have a little faith in yourself.  Turns out that a wife makes a great
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;helper.  Dropping the engine is the easy part, just follow the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Bentley intructions.  Make sure you have whatever tools (and parts)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that are required to do your repair before you get started though.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;For me, it seemed that installation was a little more time consuming,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;but I was being careful to the point of my wife calling me anal.  If
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;it's been awhile since your engine has been removed, it's a great
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;time to clean/replace the engine bearer bracket bolts.  Oh, check
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that fuel line too.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I'd suggest pulling the engine Friday evening, that way you have time
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to scrounge parts on Saturday if you come up short or break something
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;during the removal/repair.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I'd love to help but it looks like I'll be replacing the timing belt
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;on
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;my wife's Rav4 this weekend.  Trade ya...
