Subject: Heater Blower Fuses keep burning out



&gt; Twice now, the heater blower has failed to work, and I'm finding out
&gt; each time that it's because of a blown fuse.  I just put in a fresh 16
&gt; amp fuse in the in-line coupler in the rear engine compartment, right
&gt; next to the heater blower.  Again, within minutes, the fuse was blown,
&gt; and although the wires were not hot, the in-line fuse coupler was so hot
&gt; that I could not touch it.

You need to connect an ammeter IN-LINE instead of the fuse and see what the
amperage draw of the blower motor is. Probably greater than 16 amps. You
will need to replace the blower motor.

&gt;
&gt; Any ideas on why I keep blowing fuses?

Tired blower motor.

&gt; Should I be using a higher amp fuse?

NO!

&gt; Should I bypass the
&gt; system as is and hook up an alternative switch to the fan?

No, all the switch does up front is ground the relay to close it.
To add a switch, you would have to go to ground to close the relay. Your
switch cannot cause a short or any damage since it is a grounding circuit.
