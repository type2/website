Subject: Dual Advance Distributor

About the dual advance distibutor...I've used this disributor(from a 72 bus 
with dual carbs)and hooked a single advance vacuum can onto it (from a 76-79 
FI bus distributor) and got an exellent advance curve out of it close to 
that of the original distributor. I use this on my 76 bus with FI. I set the 
timing to 7.5BTDC like stock and end up with a total advance of 34BTDC. The 
stock distributor tops out at about 36BTDC. I've been using this for 40,000 
miles and have had no problems. I made the swap when my original distibutor 
crapped out and when I found the cost of a new one from Bosch to be a little 
disturbing at 365.00.
With all this distributor talk I have heard no solutions to the problems 
everybody has.
Have any of you ever used the stock Single Advance distributor on the 1600DP 
with the 34PICT3? It works great and is readily available and cheap unlike 
its 365.00 cousin that I tried to purchase. Why not use it for you 
application? Havnt we all learned that stock is the most trouble free? Let 
start coming to a conclusion about this problem...
and lay the cards out on the table:
1. the 009 hesitates with the 34pict3
2. 009 hesitates less with the 30/31
3. 009 does not have the advance curve a heavy bus needs
4. the 050 distributor is great in all buses
5. the stock vacuum advance for a stock 1600 with a 30/31 or 34pict3
will give the most reliability and mileage and that's why it came on your 
bus from the factory.
6. On a FI bus: the 009, 050, and stock single vacuum advance distributors 
all work fine and give about the same mileage and I can attest to this from 
experience. - It's your choice here
7. So what is the 009 good for? - Bugs with dual carbs
8. My advise is to solve your dizzy problems, get some spare stock 
distributors(the stock one for your bus or equivalent), get the right timing 
info for them from the type2 library and use them up as they wear out in the 
next 20 years that is, if we can still get gasoline by then...

Good luck, Sam
