Subject: 79 towing question

        Can a '79 be towed by mountind a tow bar on the front bumper?

        I plan to offer a guy $200 for a '79 tomorow and there is a chanch
that it may not run.  It's all there and it was running with low compression
on #3 when he parked it but he was not able to show it run but the battery
is dead, I will take a battery with me if I go to get it.

        (no, I am not soulless.  If I don't take it this weekend the wrecker
is coming for it on monday)
