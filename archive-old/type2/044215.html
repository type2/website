Subject: [T2] Flashing oil light/power loss/yikes

Hello,

I took a small road trip this past weekend to test the 77 2L engine that I 
recently installed into my 75 westy. After about 90-100 miles I noticed 
some hesitation and the flashing of the oil light. I stopped at a service 
station to check it out. The oil level was a little low. I have noticed a 
leak that only happens when the engine is running for a while. I added 1/2 
quart of oil, and let it sit shut down to cool off although it was not 
excessively hot. I ran it another 5 or 10 miles and it did the same thing 
hesitation and flashing light. The light would flash only when reaching a 
certain RPM. We towed it home and today I did a compression test. 100 in 
cylinders 1,3,and 4 105 in cylinder 2. Muir says that this light flashing 
at high idle means overhaul time but how can I need an overhaul with Good 
compression in all cylinders. The timing is definetely not perfect I've 
only done it statically. My next step is to check the point gap with a 
tach dwell meter and do the timing with a strobe light. My instincts tell 
me however that this problem is not due to imperfect timing adjustment. 
does anyone have any advice. Please be gentle.
There is an exhaust leak for sure as i stuffed a shirt in the tailpipe and 
it did very little and as I mentioned a pretty good oil leak when hot. 
coming from the rear of the  engine.
