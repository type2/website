Subject: need aux. air valve (FI)

Hi,

I have a cold-start problem caused by a broken auxiliary air bypass
valve. Don't remember the part number now, but it ends with 101, I
believe. 

I also need the L-shaped hose that goes from the oil breather to the
S-shaped &quot;air-tunnel&quot;. Mine is cracked at both ends and lets in false
air.

Finally, I *may* need a new decel valve, although fixing the other
things may be all that's needed. (The symptoms are that the engine,
even when warm, will almost stall upon deceleration at a stop light,
but usually recatch &quot;its breath&quot; at the last moment and then idle
normally. Other opinions?)

This is for '75 bus, but parts from later model breadloaves should
work, too. Let me know if you have those parts for sale.

TIA!

Sami
