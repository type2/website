Some people think riding motorcycles and jumping out of airplanes is safe,
it's all relative, you just have to be around a gas heater to understand how
safe these heaters really are.

They've put millions of these gas heaters in cars, tanks, army vehicles and
airplanes.  I know people are scared of them, but from the day I started
working on them in 1974 I have yet to come accross one that has burned on
it's own.  Now I sure can't say that about our VW's!!!

Some people even call us bus pilots crazy for riding in those &quot;death traps&quot;.
Believe me, the gas heaters are safe, it's all in people's minds, not in the
facts.  I wish everyone of the skeptics could enjoy a nice warm ride on a
really bone chilling day, no better way to quench the fears.
