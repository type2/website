Subject: new engine, any thoughts?

hi all,

matty here again. so ive got my 76 westy, and i want
to replace the engine.   i would like to replace it
with a 78 engine, so as to take advantage of the
hydraulic lifters. i know that the bus depot sells
this engine for about 1140, and since i worked there i
know who they go through(wont disclose this now
however).  also saw a 78 engine on the boston engine
site for 2500, thats pretty much more than the
depot's. has anyone purchased engines from either of
these vendors who would be willing to offer any feed
back to me, the nave. also, who is this jack raby
fellow, and could he sell me a 78 engine. thanks in
advance. -matty
