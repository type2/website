        No, say I.  My '74 thing is still in the hands of it's original
owner, ME!(yes, for thouse of you who have met me.  There is a long story in
this)  I have a auto trend (I think that is the name of the magazine)review
of the thing and the owners manual and there is no mention of an automatic.

        The thing had a thing spicific transmission.  Mine now has a
standard bug transmission as the thing transmission only lasted about four
years (the original tranney is still lying around just in case I ever feel
like tinkering on it).
