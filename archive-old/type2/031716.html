one of the few times I've had to use my AAA is when a rear wheel bearing
failed catastrophically at 65MPH on I-95 one hot morning.....not one of my
&quot;Funner&quot; experiences
    it was still packed with grease but it just stopped going round and
slid in the grease until a couple of the rollers gave up. about half of
the bearings were flat, no idea how long this had been going on.

ruined the stub axle too.
