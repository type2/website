Subject: re: new t/s switch

&gt;craig, i'd say w/o doubt your NOS switch was made to fit 68 and 69 buses. in
&gt;those years wires ran directly from the switch to the front signals


in point of fact, they go staight to the lil' black boxO nine pins, 
and then to the turn signals.  looked at the wiring diagram this 
morning. so i have a beautiful NOS t/s switch for busses made two 
months before mine. *sigh*  so we now can add that &quot;G&quot; is very early 
bay to our knowledge base, at least.

while cutting the wires WOULD work, it seems a shame to cut an NOS 
item. i'm gonna check my bus and see my options, but if i decide NOT 
to give it a busectomy, anyone who HAS a 68 - 69 bus is free to email 
me for this. i paid $75,  -including-  shipping. so will you.

stevo. let me know the details on your used switch.......
