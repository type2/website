Subject: Re: [T2] Spark Plugs Bosch vs NGK

Well, here's what I have gathered from this off the wall thread---

Ted, who ives down the road apiece from me, finds two different sets of
plugs and wants to know which one to use.

Dr. Frankentein Tim Quackenbush, thinks that because he read 15 years
ago, in some Benzomatic company circulation, no one should EVER use a
better plug in his or her Gerstunken mobile.

Now ole Louis Farakan Gerorge, mild mannered list administrator, says
that because the electrode of aformentioned plugs aren't made out of pig
iron,( the lowest connductor of electrical voltage on the continuity
scale )--the platnium plugs which do conduct juice much better than the
iron plugs, shouldn't be used either, because they will burn valves in
the Land of the Rising Sun Vehicles.

And then to top it off-- violates every game rule he sets, and just
slaps his own hand
--for shame, for shame----

Interesting stuff---

Ted, go ahead and use any plug you want---

As you can obviously see, this is just a scene from the movie, &quot;One Flew
Over The Coo-Coo's Nest&quot;--and they are all temporarily wacky--and the
hospital administrator has flipped too-- (They are coming to take me
away--ah--ha--)

I have truely believe I have seen and heard it all now--in Type 2
Busland--:&gt;)

Oh Brother--

Later,
