Speaking of distributors. I have a 1600dp and it is currently running a
stock Vac-advanced distributor. Well I have been having problems with
overheating, maybe that trivializes it a little too much I have been having
EXTREME problems with OVERHEATING. I have actually asked advice on the list
before and the advice recieved did help to cool it down some. I also went to
the extent of pulling the engine, replacing the exhaust manifold and muffler
system, removing all the tins diping and repainting them, cleaning to a
shine a 30yr old engine block, rebuilding and readjusting the carb, and
replacing the condenser. The only thing I didn't do was check the timing at
full advance, well luckily for me I have a friend that works at a local VW
shop and I took it down there for them to look it over before we leave for
the rainbow gathering(2000+ miles roundtrip) anyway he took a look at it
timing carb adjustment and at full advance it was at 52deg ?!?!?!?!?!? He
reccomended removing it and installing a .009 unstead. I was wondering once
I get it out and put the .009 in is there anything I can do to correct the
advance on the current one so I can use it as a reliable/functional spare?

On a good note he said as long as I replace that she sounds and looks like
she will run for many more miles than the 2000 I request from her right now.
Which made me feel good not only because she deserves a long life but also
until now she hasn't seen the inside of a shop, unless you call my garage a
shop, since I got her and in saying that he indirectly complimented me on my
work. And I would definatley have to say he complimented the list and the
type2 library because without everyone here and the massive amount of
documented VW info on that page I would probably be pretty hard pressed to
have done as well with her as I have.

Well off to replace the distributor....

PS. begining saturday morning PADME, me and spencer will be heading to Idaho
I have made a list of people between here and there via AIRS however I was
wondering if anyone has traveled the route and can reccomend places to stop
and rest, eat, etc... or if anyone knows a particularly intersting route
there. The point of origin is Phoenix and the the gathering is outside of
Boise this year. This is PADME's first long distance journey and we will be
taking it easy so we will have plenty of time to take in the world.
