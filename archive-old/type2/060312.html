Subject: RE: Lowering the Flame suit...

Hey all,

Over the years I've watched many threads come and go about lowering and
raising sagging rear ends and have decided to through in a penny or two.

 - I remember when my folks bought a brand new 1971 seven passenger VW
bus. Without a driver and/or passenger aboard it too squatted in the
rear -- brand spanking new from the factory. 

- All instructions about aiming headlights, specifically on a bus,
mention that you should have people sitting in the bus to get it to
normal level before doing so. Any measurement related to how level the
bus should require the same. looking at one sitting in the driveway is
not indicative of proper loading. 

- In the rear suspension adjustment section of Bentley there is a
measurement made of the angle of the arm but none what so ever of how
level the bus is. While I am sure some torsion bars may be weaker after
many years on the road merely adjusting them till the bus is level seems
somewhat risky to me. Wouldn't it be better to replace them and adjust
the rear end to spec?

My .02,

-Scott
