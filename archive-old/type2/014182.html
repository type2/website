Subject: Re: [T2] How to browsing the archive

Browsing and searching are mutually exclusive. =^)

If you get into the MHonArc reflector (click &quot;Type2&quot;, then click 
&quot;Read&quot;), you can read the most recent 1000 messages (in reverse 
chronological order) by continually clicking &quot;Next Page&quot;. There should 
be about 50 iterations of this in the reflector. About a months' worth 
probably.
