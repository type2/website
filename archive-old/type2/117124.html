Subject: Coolers and Gaskets

Ashley is running hot at the moment. He touched a staggering 140 degrees C
oil temp on the way to Vanfest at the end of a long run. Thankfully this
dropped quickly with some 30mph 3rd gear running and a bit more care on the
way back to keep him at 120 max. Looks like a I got away with it as he is
still running properly with normal power and ticks over beautifully. Engine
sounds very good as well.

On my return I went hunting for what I hopped was a loose engine bay seal
or something caught in the fan but neither seemed to be a problem. I now
suspect the oil cooler has too much muck in it. It's obviously working as I
can cool the engine with slower running but it needs looking at.

My question: On a 1600CC Type 1 engine, can the fan shroud be removed so I
can see the cooler WITHOUT dropping the engine ? It looks fiddly but
dooable if I take the alternator out, but before I get stuck in I thought
there must be someone out there who has tried this. Incidentally, has
anyone got pictures online of doghouse &amp; non-doghouse coolers ? I'm not
entirely sure what I have and am now curoius, especially if I decide to
replace the cooler !

Second question (unrelated as far as I know): In the Haynes manual, on P51
it warns against using a pre-heater gasket with a small hole when
re-fitting the exhaust. The photos shows the same one I used (it came in
the fitting kit) when I recently re-fitted it and I assume this is the one
with the &quot;small hole&quot; as it does appear to be smaller than the inside
diameter of the pipe. Can anyone confirm this and also explain what the
effect of fitting such a gasket would be. I assume it restricts flow of gas
and can't see why anyone would want to use a gasket to do this, but what
would I gain by taking the gasket back out and making the hole the right
size ?
