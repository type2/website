&gt; The Muir book is NOT out of print, according to
&gt; Amazon. They sell 30th anniversary issue for $20, and
&gt; the official Bentley manual is under $30.
&gt; The Muir book is good entertainment and
&gt; inspiration, but you want the Bentley book (or at
&gt; least the Haynes manual) for more details and photos
&gt; and pictures.


I stock all three, plus a fourth:  the Pocket Mechanic manual by Peter
Russek of England.  This manual is written for the backyard mechanic, and
much less technical than the Bentley (albeit not as well illustrated as the
Haynes).  However, it is sized to fit in your glovebox, which is nice.
Different versions for pre-72 and post-72 busses (as with the Haynes).

The Muir book runs $19.95, the Bentley $27.95.  The Haynes and the Pocket
Mechanic books run $12.95 each.  All are in stock.  Place a $50 or larger
order (i.e. a few books, or perhaps a few oil filters or spark plugs to
round it up) and you get an additional 5% listmember discount.  (Must ask
for it when ordering.)
