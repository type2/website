&amp;gt; A basic rule of physics tells me that there's no such thing as a free  
&amp;gt; lunch. So what's it do to throttle response when you add an extra 20A

What are planning on doing to Bob Greg?  Big honkin stereo with a 42&amp;quot; flat
screen?

Oh, and Lava Lamps, lots of Lava Lamps.

I was interested because I am a geek at heart. I have 2 10&amp;quot; subs with a
1600watt amp attached and the remaining speakers are pushed by a 450watt
amp. The sub amp probably only draws about 100 because it's turned all the
way down, just used it because I had it available at no cost -- it WAS
pushing 2 10's in my '66 bug, talk about bounce!

Add to that the 450W inverter I use to run my laptop for GPS, the stereo
head unit, the Sirius satellite reciever, the Rockford Fosgate DMP1 MP3
deck... Get the idea yet?

I already have an aux battery with a 1.5 Farad cap to run the stereo stuff
and inverter so I shouldn't kill my main battery -- but I'd like the aux
battery to be able to a bit of a charge somewhere along the way.

You planning to turn Bob into the campground discotech or adding a luxury
or two like a full size screen DVD player fo the kids to watch when you do
a trip that entails 12 - 16 hour driving days to &amp;quot;get there&amp;quot;? Of course,
when you tell them about the new DVD player you probably shouldn't mention
you're shopping for trip DVDs by visiting here:

P.S.

Throttle response shouldn't suffer unless you are USING the extra capacity
at the time. An unloaded alternator is like spinning a stick with bearings.
Actually hitting the excess amperage should be a rare occurence unless one
DOES add a full home theater runn off a 3000+watt inverter. I'd like it to
be there to charge an aux battery that's used while shut down. After 20 or
30 minutes the battery should catch up. Even the big stereo shouldn't max
out the alternator and will hit the cap every once in a while for peaks.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
