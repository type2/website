&gt; Anyone know of a place near DC?  Would like to know where to look for parts
&gt; if I need too...  Also anyone in the DC Metro area have a &quot;running&quot; engine
&gt; they want to sell? Doesn't have to be that good....just running...

where in the DC area, there is the &quot;Hidden&quot; treasure trove of VW/Porsches
in Elkridge about halfway to Baltimore, need a guide to find it, but worth
the trek
