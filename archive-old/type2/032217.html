Subject: Pump Sinks in Campers Question 
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.4.02A.9811241341280.12150-100000_at_insci14.ucsd_dot_edu&gt;

I have a '77 camper van which is clearly some sort of American
conversion.  Included in it is a water tank which delivers water to a pump
type sink thingy (technical name is thing-a-ma-gigger).  the pump doesn't
work anymore, and when I took it apart I found that a gasket inside it
which opens on the up strokes and closes on the down strokes was all
cracked and no good at all.  has anyone ever heard of getting a new gasket
for one of these?  I saw that Bus Depot sells one which would likely work,
although I imagine that it is not the same as the one that I had.  It cost
$40, so that is  certainly an option, although I'd much rather spend $5
for the right gasket.

Any help will be appreciated.
