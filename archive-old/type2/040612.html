Subject: Clarification of Great Bus Tour -Canada

Dear Alyshia and Folks,

Oops, this is one I hadn't thought of. The Tour isn't going to Canada, it's
already in Canada (Ontario to be exact) and this particular leg would be for
people who live there or who had planned to be there during this particular
time frame.

The Tour is an on-going more or less &quot;off the cuff&quot; type of thing that
pretty much plans itself. The people who want to drive the Tour sign up with
me (the Tour Secretary-well sort of) and we plan the route according to the
location of the individuals who want to drive in certain given areas. Right
now it's in Central Canada and after that it's going to the Midwest because
that's where it was headed after Leo (who was the previous &quot;trail boss&quot;)
stopped calling the shots. Even that got sidelined temporarily when John
Hartranft and Steve Dolan couldn't meet up on the first try. We're trying to
get things a little better organized, but we don't want to over organize and
take all the fun out of it.

For more information on where the Tour may be heading check out the web site
at http://www.type2_dot_com/~chuff . The updates are given there as is the list
of drivers shown by state or nation and that will give some indication of
where the Tour will be going once it hits a given area.

There's nothing to stop you from going to Canada, Alyshia, but I don't think
that anyone is planning a trip &quot;en masse&quot; to Canada just for this. The Tour
will be coming to California though, and if you'd like to sign up for a leg
in California or if you plan to be in some of the other areas when the
Hubcap moves again, we could sign you up for that. Let me know by p-mail
(pearlgrl_at_bellsouth_dot_net ) and we'll sign you up.

Hope this helps instead of adding to any confusion! If anyone has any
questions regarding the Tour please e-mail me and I'll try to answer them.

Chris and Gus the &quot;I thought *I* was the Tour Secretary&quot; Bus
