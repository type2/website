&gt;  If you've got a stock type4 eng. and live in a hot/humid climate, you're 
&gt; gonna see temps well in excess of 210 on a regular basis. running 250+ 
&gt; (measured at the sump) on long hiway speed trips is common. VW itself said 

well I have a 78 that is pretty close to stock, have guages, rebuilt about
25kk ago and use Mobil 1 synthetic.  here in the midatlantic it gets
pretty hot and humid in the summer.  I won't let mine get over 240 and
would pull over if it got to 250 even on I-95 on long runs

&gt; the real world, that is as good as none! Also on that note, the oil BYPASSES 
&gt; the oil cooler until pressure is under 37psi. Yep, that's right. And if you 

huh?? my psi NEVER gets under 37psi even at idle, you mean I have never
used my oil cooler

&gt; do the math (and yea, I'm an ME, I do the math, I'm also a bit of an A$$hole, 

ok I'm a TE but big deal I can do the math too.

&gt; but hey, can't win 'em all...) that tells you that your oil pressure at 
&gt; 3500rpm is gonna be around 17psi max _at_ temps above 240deg. Keep in mind kids, 

not always, at idle I lift the relief valve at 65 or so psi and can't
remember it ever being below 40psi no matter what the temp.  now I will
admit when the engine was rebuilt we honed a new oil pump to almost
perfect spec

&gt; that oil temp and oil pressure are inversely related. VW didn't put an oil 

true

&gt; pressure gauge in the type2 for a reason. Same reason that the pressure 

no they didn't put a guage in because it was an economy car and had no
extra features it didn't need

&gt; Father bought a '79 Westy brand new off the showroom floor. First thing he 

and I had a 71 off the showroom floor...ran it hard and it dropped a rod
at 112k

&gt; it, ran as close to 75mph as road conditions allowed. Not a single problem in 
&gt; over 120k miles. When he sold it, it had 130-135psi in every hole, and a max 
&gt; leak down of 6%. He was a fiend for maintenance, however. If we took the 

mine has at least 313k on it 

&gt; advise of some on the List, we would never drive our Busses. Just sit around 
&gt; arguing inane specs, and treating them like Rare, Fragile, Unreliable Relics. 
&gt; Oh, sorry, guess some of us already do that. Me, I prefer to DRIVE!!!!!

just got back from a week long 1,200 mile trip into the Anarondack
mountains in upstate NY, and a long drive down I-95 on the way home from
Boston to Baltimore in about 8 hours, stopped only for gas meet me at
everrybus and look at the guage as I pull in if you don't believe me,
should arrive early afternoon Fri if the auto tranny holds up.
