Subject: Voltage Regulator?

I am reinstalling a once removed (wires even clipped) engine bay warm 
air heating fan. I am unable to get the blue wire from the voltage 
regulator to deliver enough voltage through the relay to bring the 
contacts down. I have a good ground at the power switch (dash) and the 
power lead through the relay (red wire w/fuse) has a solid 12V. I 
measured the voltage on the blue wire with the ignition key on (engine 
not running) and it was under 1V. I also ran 12V through the relay and 
the contacts worked fine. The engine is being put together at this 
time so I am unable to start it and check it that way. My thought is 
that the voltage regulator only allows enough voltage to close the 
contacts when the engine is actually running and automatically 
disengages when the engine is off. Any thoughts?
