&lt;&lt; Well, you said it.  They're selling it to kids and they don't really care
about the specs.  The good thing is that it is a DOT-ized version of a
Japanese Domestic Market car and Toyota engineers them well.  What they
don't want to admit to the teenyboppers is that the xB is a very
utilitarian mommymobile, so they concentrate on the pretty geegaws (I'm no
kidding, one of the accessories is multicolored illuminated cupholders!)
that the kids can buy. &gt;&gt;

And from another list, this dialogue at an auto show:

Customer: &quot;Are those hood scoops functional?&quot;
Salesman: &quot;They are very functional.&quot;
Customer: &quot;What exactly do they do?&quot;
Salesman: &quot;They do look cool, don't they?&quot;
