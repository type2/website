Subject: LiMBO Web Update, Camping this weekend in Maine

Hi Volks,
   Just wanted to let everyone know that I just did dome quick updates to
the LiMBO Web Site. (address listed below) Most of the updates are
cosmetic, but I did add a couple of photos to the photo album. The
classifieds will be updated by the end of the month.  Its not much but if
you check out Generations Summit '96 you'll see a spy photo of the new VR6
Eurovan. BTW, if you would like to be listed on our Link page, I'm getting
ready to revamp the whole thing (some of the links are outdated) so send me
your URL.  All I ask is a link to the LiMBO site on your page. Thanks.

   While I have your attention.  A great camping event is happening this
weekend in Sears Port, Maine.  This would be a great chance to have some of
the list members get together.  Perhaps we can start an East Coast Camping
Club. (ECCC)=)  Well, e-mail me direct if you would like more info.   Take
care.

                        Keep on Busin' -Jim
