Subject: VW junkyards around Wheeling WV

Anyone know of any?  I have to go up there for
Thanksgiving and thought i would look
around............

Adam, that is many hours from my neck of the
woods but there is the king of all vw junkyards
close by.  It is in Cambridge, Ohio and is south
east of the intersection of I77 and I70.  You
cannot miss it.  I think it is maybe 45 minutes
from Wheeling.  The guy has hundreds and hundreds
of busses.  

=====
Peace and blessings, 
Nemo, the Busless Captain
