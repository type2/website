Subject: Re: [T2] 78 engine / 091 tranny -&gt; 72?

&gt; I've read Richard's FAQ (http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/FAQ.html -
&gt; 4.1)since sending this, and it got me wondering if mating a '78 engine
&gt; to the original 002 transmission would be feasible.  I thought this was
&gt; a big no-no, but could the flywheel from the 1700 go onto a 2L to allow
&gt; a fit?
&gt;

From what I understand if you take the flywheel and bellhousing with the
1700 it would work. But the gearing would be all wrong. The higher torque in
the 2.0 lets you have taller gears. That means higher speeds in each gear
and easier in-town rowing. Plus, as I said, the effective RPM limit is lower
in the 2.0, requiring the taller gears.

I would swap them as a unit, personally. Then you know &quot;everything&quot; is 78,
and it's easier to remember when things break.
