&gt;conventional, they run better and stay cleaner, less prone to fouling.

I noticed that NGK B6ES-11 is a commonly available plug (B6ES with a stock 1.1mm gap ). Would you recommend widening the gap on the B6ES to 0.40&quot; or shrinking the gap on the B6ES-11 for CDI? The B6ES-11 has a slightly recessed electrode...

&gt;I finally got sick of the bucking enough to
&gt;dig into it this past weekend and discovered it was simply too much plug
&gt;gap; since they grow as the plugs wear. I re-set them to .030&quot; and it's
&gt;smooth as molassas now once again. :-/

I had a similar experience with my wife's car. I had become so used to it's reliability I had completely forgotten about the spark plugs. As the dealer was taking care of the maintenance I checked all of the repair receipts and couldn't find any mention of plugs charged as parts. Sure enough a check of the records showed that they had gone almost 60k miles and had gigantic gaps.

The car ran well (not excellent) but the mileage had dropped off sharply as a result of the plug gap.
