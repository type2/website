Subject: RE: [T2] BA6 guard/bellypan?

&gt; Has anyone thats retrofitted a BA6 onto a baywindow bus ever put
&gt; a bellypan in place somehow to protect it?

I have a used original one that's about to go into the trash, unless anyone
would like it for free and lets me know ASAP. Sorry, too big to ship.
(Located about 30 miles NW of Philly.)  I am almost certain it's from a
'76-79 bus (it could be from an aircooled Vanagon but I think not).
