&gt; In one cylinder some H20 got in there and there is a very small area where
&gt; etching has occurred in the cylinder wall. The only ring that rides over
&gt; this area is the top most ring. The area is only about 2mm wide by 2cm long
&gt; but deep enough to be easily felt with your fingers. The rest of the piston
&gt; wall looks great with no signs of wear. In fact you can still the honing
&gt; marks in the cylinder wall. There is no evidence of blow-by but the etching
&gt; may have occurred since the engine was last run.
&gt;  
&gt; Only this one cylinder is so affected.
&gt;  
&gt; My questions are. . .
&gt;  
&gt; - Should I be concerned about this?

maybe
get a cyl hone and hone the cyl

&gt; - If so, can a single cylinder be purchased without getting and entire set?

yes, but....it probably won't be balanced, and get a piston too, replace
both as a set

&gt; Where?

probably only place is used.  check BustedBus
