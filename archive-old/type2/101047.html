&gt; Yes there is a shaft seal (similar to a main shaft seal) that goes around the
&gt; throttle body butterfly valve shaft. I could see air leaking from this
&gt; location when I immersed and pressurized my setup. It is a major source

Ah... nevermind.  I thought the seal in question was the gasket 'tween
the throttle body and manifold.  This is good info for when I talk
to the mechanic today.  Sounds like ol' Dandy may have the same problem.
(Why couldn't I have waited another day!?)  Smart idea removing the whole
system intake and pressurizing it!
