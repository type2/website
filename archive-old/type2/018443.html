&gt; Here's a curiosity..  Everyone talks about how gutless the upright motor
&gt; is.  I will make no claims to huge power, but mine with a Brazillian 009,
&gt; and an otherwise stock 71 setup does 70 in the flats pretty handily, does
&gt; lose speed up hills if my rpms are wrong, and gets me about 22 mpg + or -
&gt; my mood. My mileage gets better if I keep it under 60.  I will admit to
&gt; having an unknown year later (pancake) transmission.  Is all of this due to
&gt; the 009, the tranny or what????

Tromper:
The 70 owner's manual listed &quot;maximum and cruising speed as 65 mph&quot;
(pickup with tarpaulin-59mph).
A 71 had a few hp more cause of the carb and heads and I think the
manual said 68 mph. The 72 (US version w/1700) showed 78 mph. 
I think all these numbers may be a bit conservative, but we must also
remember that most all speedos are a little optimistic, so your
observations are  representative of most 71's I'd guess.
The bigger motors are a bit faster, but you pay for it with fuel
consumption!
Both are faster than your diesel Vanagon, though it's the economy king!
