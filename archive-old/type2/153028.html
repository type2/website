Subject: Re: [T2] Lesson learnt about oil seals

Hello Guys  I use a transmission assembly lube on the seals I install  made 
by a company call Smart Blend .  I dought very seriously that not lubing the 
seal at all would really tear it.  It probably was more of an installers error 
more than anything else .   I also tend to use a sealant between the crank and 
flywheel on VW motors  . later and have fun  Mark Dearing
