Subject: my lectrical problem (hypothesis test)

Again, many thanks to everyone that has given me advice on this issue. Has anyone ever had an ignition coil go out on them? What are the symptoms? For as far as I know, an engine can run without one as long as you have an alternate way of starting it...am I right? Could this be my problem?
 
Again...thanks,
Colby
