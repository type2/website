&gt;I am wondering if this might not be the bus I found North of Houston a few

&gt;running out.

I really doubt that this is the same bus.  He told me that he brought the 
bus out from California several years ago (just like I did with my 
Safare).  I have no reason to doubt his story, but like I said I will be 
happy to go check the bus out for anyone that is interested.
