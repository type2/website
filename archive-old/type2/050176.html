Subject: [T2] BBB-V from SoCal anyone?

Now that I'm subscribed for the day...

Are there any SoCal listees heading for BBB-V on Friday the 19th?

I'll was thinking of hitting the10/15 junction around 10:30AM-ish. I'll have
the portable CB on channel 4, per chance you pass me, and have a CB. Please
P-Mail. Perhaps a carabus?
