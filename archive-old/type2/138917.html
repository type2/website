Subject: Auto Tranny engine conversions

Hi Volks,

Just wondering... Has anyone ever seen an engine conversion applied to an
Automatic tranny bus?  It would seem to me that the flex plate wouldn't be
any more difficult to fabricate an adapter to than the flywheel is.

Would there be issues with a higher output engine pushing the auto trans? Or
would the torque converter take care of it?

Nothing's wrong with the engine that's in the sunroof now, I was just
daydreaming and thought I'd ask.


Happy trails,
