Subject: Vehicle wrapping

Notwithstanding the overwhelming corporate consumerism 
&quot;everything's for sale&quot; soullessness issues brought up here, it is marginal bus content at best.

Flame suit on!

Billy

has anyone had any experience with these vehicle wrapping companies that pay you to drive around with an ad plastered over your vehicle.
I am considering this for my bus. After all, she gets plenty of looks
w/o any flashy vinyl ad on it and I wouldn't mind an extra $400 a month.
