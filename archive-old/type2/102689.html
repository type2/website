Subject: Re: [T2] Wow! Spare tire carriers, ladders, racks, etc.

The gentleman in question is Gary Lee, he is a very nice guy 
we exchange e-mail all the time. That is actually my 15&quot; 
South African Alloy Rhein Wheel in some of the pics. 

There are several people on the vanagon list that have 
already bought his stuff. As soon as I make up my mind (there 
are a lot of options to choose from), I will too. I'm 
thinking about a ladder (w/ Jerrycan &amp; highlift) and spare 
tire rack for my syncro westy...

Thanks,
Chris
