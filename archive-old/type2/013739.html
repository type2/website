&gt;Anybody out there painted their Westy top with a Gloss White product and 
&gt;proud of it?  What did you use?

Painting the top is a PITA to get it glossy.  I've done one, on a '76
that was pretty crazed and degelled.  Cleaned it, and again, and
pressure washed, and TSP'd, and pressure washed.  Sprayed it
all with a sprayable polyester filler to restore the gel-coat.  Topcoated
with white acryllic enamel.  Looked real good till I sold it and I've seen
it around and it still does.  Royal PITA, $200 in paint easy, many
days work, had to wax it from then out.

A friend bought a gallon of white reflective RV roof paint ($20).  Cleaned
pretty well (the TSP and scrub brush then the pressure wash) and
rolled it on.  Looked every bit nearly as nice as mine and it muffled
heavy rain sound a bit.  Might have reflected heat better I don't know.
I think he got the stuff from (aghast) JC Whitless, but most RV places
sell the stuff.  It wasn't &quot;glossy&quot; per say but it was, and stayed
real darn white as the stuff has some sort of antifungal antimildew
crap in it.  If I were to do it again and I might on the '82 it is the
route I will take.
