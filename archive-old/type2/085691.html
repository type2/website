Subject: Differences 71 or 72 Bus trannies?

Hey all,

I recently picked up a 72 camper, 1700cc - it doesn't to to &quot;fly&quot; as nice as 
my 71 camper even though it has the bigger motor. Are the trannies geared 
differently, hearing and feeling differnet things when I am at higher speeds 
in 4th.

thanks...
