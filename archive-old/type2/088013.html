Subject: Re: [T2] VW parts yard in Petersburg, VA???

Joel
      I was by there last November.  At least then there wasn't 250 Buses.
They were mostly Bays, but I've spoke to the owner online since and they
were getting some Splits.  They may very well be 250 by now.  I'll look on
the map and get the route number if no one responds.  Seems to me though
that the owner is part of the List.

Dave
