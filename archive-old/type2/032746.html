Subject: Machine shop in Portland, OR

Can someone recommend a good VW machine shop in the Portland, OR area?  I'm
tentatively going to have my heads rebuilt, and probably hand my crakshaft,
camshaft, case, etc. over to someone who knows what they're doing.  This is
my first rebuilt, so a very friendly shop (who can help me decide what
needs to be replaced) would be nice.
