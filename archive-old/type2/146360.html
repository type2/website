Subject: tranny blew :(

Hey all,

I was just driving my '81 automatic-transmissiong vanagon down the 
road, when I noticed almost simultaneously two things.  First, a small 
puff of smoke caught my eye out the rearview, and second, the engine 
seemed to be revving a bit higher than seemed right.  By the following 
block, the engine was *definitely* revving high, and the van wasn't 
actually accelerating much.  So I coasted to a parking spot and hopped 
out, to find the street covered in AT fluid, which was dribbling 
profusely from roughly where the transmission and engine connect.

So $60 later, the van is parked outside my home, and I have to ponder 
next moves.  Any suggestions?  Is it likely that I'd be able to pull 
the transmission, replace a few gaskets, put it back together, and be 
good to go?  If not, what are my options, keeping in mind that spending 
money really isn't one of them :(  Pay somebody money I don't have to 
fix the tranny?  Pay somebody money I don't have for a stick-shift 
tranny, and drop that in?  Give up and sell the van, in not-running 
condition, and lose all the work I put into rebuilding the engine over 
last summer?  Buy lottery tickets and hope?

Any tests I should run before making a hasty decision?  I have Haynes, 
Muir, and Chilton, but don't have a copy of Bentley.  The library does, 
though, so I could photocopy a few relevant pages if necessary...

Thanks for any suggestions...

Anton.
