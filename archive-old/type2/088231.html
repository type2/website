There are other issues with strapping a HD magnet to the bottom of your
case, or around the pickup tube.  It will also magnetize that big ol'
spinning thing in there called the crankshaft.  THAT'S not where I want
those particles to be stuck!  Besides, there are many other things floating
around in there that will not be caught by the magnet.

Before you sell out good money for
weak magnets, check out this website.
http://www.wondermagnet_dot_com/dev/main.shtml They sell Rare Earth Neodymium
magnets cheap. These magnets are extremely strong. Their size is deceiving.
You can easily injure yourself if you don't give these magnets the respect
they deserve.  They're not toys for your 6 year old. They're not toys for
your 36 year old either, but that person is on their own.
