Subject: Re: [T2] A possible solution to leaky S-Boots?

A friend who works for Pac Bell scored me a roll of GIANT shrink wrap
they use for underground...  I did my s boot in this a few years back.

I've been hoarding the stuff - but I probably should cough some up at a
nominal cost to needy listees...

I dunno how long the plasti dip will last - my hoses were so filthy even
after I cleaned them with simple green inside and out repeatedly that I
doubt anything would adhere - and it doesn't seem it'd be very heat
resistant.

It's a challenge to get it on - then you must work carefully and slowly
as you heat it from the middle, kinda tug it around the curves for a
better fit.
