The load range C version of the 195/75R14 tire doesn't have the
load rating (1540 lbs) needed for a bus.  In fact, I was surprised to
find that
the load rating is less than the passenger version of the 185R14 size,
after I got talked by the friendly tire man into thinking that it was
&quot;exactly the same&quot;!  You need to get the D range if you have to go with
the 195/75 size.
