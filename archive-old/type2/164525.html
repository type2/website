Subject: RE: [T2] Engine swap help (76 2.0L into a 74 bus)

&gt; My friend has a 74 bus with problems...
&gt; I believe he has a 1700 engine ...
&gt; Now, I have an extra '76 2.0L engine...
&gt; I'd like to find out what issues we're going to run into if I 
&gt; try and take the 76 engine and put it in a 74.  Will those 
&gt; carbs work on the 2L engine?  Do they just need to be 
&gt; rejetted?  Also, I noticed that they have different 
&gt; flywheels, but I figured I could just take the flywheel off 
&gt; his engine and put it on the 76.


If it's the stock '74 engine, it should be 1.8L (although as I recall CB
would denote a '72-73 1.7L). In either case, the swap to a 2.0L is fairly
straightforward. You can use the smaller flywheel on the 2.0L engine, and
the carbs will work.  You are best off sticking with the '74 heater boxes
and exhaust as well, as those replacement parts are more readliy available.
While the exhaust ports are just slightly different on the 2.0L heads, the
difference is small enough that the '74 heater boxes will still bolt on.
