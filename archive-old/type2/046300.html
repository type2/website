Subject: [T2] Westy inside sliding door handle

Here's a picture of the original inside sliding door handle (towards the
front) for the 68-75 Westy with the spice rack/table on the outer side of
the fridge:

HowEVah! And I just learned this: The handle on my 73 goes on a square
shank that is tapped in the center. The shank on my 69 (and, I just
learned, Mike's 71) is a different shape, to wit:

Steve calls it castellated. Did this change occur in 72 or 73?

Mike's photo looks like the rear &quot;silent&quot; closing handle. Or is the photo
flopped? But what's all that stuff sticking out the back of the door? I
seem to remember the 69 cross-bar mechanism I pulled for Brian's 71 had two
big ends on it. I need to check my bus and see if it's got shanks for two
handles.

Hm....
