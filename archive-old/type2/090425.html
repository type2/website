Subject: Re: [T2] Problem using 34 PICT Carb on 1600DP

&gt; I'm in the process of building a 1600 DP for my 71 Bus using the
&gt; distributor and carb from a 73 Super Beetle.  Problem is that the 34
&gt; PICT used on the 73 Beetle doesn't have all the taps that the 34 PICT
&gt; used on the 71 Bus.  It only has one tap and that is for the vacuum
&gt; advance.  There is no tap on the carb for the retard side of the
&gt; diaphram.  The retard vacuum appears to come from a manifold tap just
&gt; below the carb on the 73 Beetle.

Andrew... time to hit the yards....  the early 70's SBs had a manifold
vacuum tap drilled into the left DP manifold casting.  If yours is from a
'73 it *may* have it, my '71 SB did have it.  This is for the throttle
positioner originally, but provides perfectly adequate manifold vacuum for
the vac retard port on the dist as well.

&gt; I'm planning to forget about the retard and just leave the retard port
&gt; on the diaphram open.  I'll just time the engine to 34 BTDC at 3500
&gt; RPM.  Anybody see anything wrong with this?

Nothing.  Per Karl, if you don't use the vac retard, time to 7.5 BTDC,
tho.

&gt; I guess I could tap the manifold but I'd rather avoid this.

Take a look at the left end casting.  If you don't have the tap, you will
still see the place it goes cast into the end.  Take it to any decent
machine shop with  a section of properly sized hose and they can drill it
and swage in a port tube in 5 minutes or less, honest!
