Subject: re :Gas in Oil 

&gt;I went to change the oil and noticed that the oil did not smell right and
&gt;after some consulting to see if what I smelled was actually what I smelled it
&gt;was a unanomious decision that I have gas in my oil.  How did it get there
and
&gt;what should I be looking for?  This is a brand new long block and I wonder
how
&gt;much damage I could have done to this motor?  
&gt;
 Have it checked out or check it out  right away it could easily be the
float of the carb sticking open in which case you will be on the way to a
rebuild shortly.  It will leak more and more gas into the engine cleaning
the pistons of any oil.  Ask me how I know.

If you have fuel injection I really don't know.

But trust me gas in the oil is very serious.

Peace

Snoopy
