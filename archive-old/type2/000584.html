I have the original blaupunkt stokholm radio that came with my '71 bus the
lights come on but no sound could anyone recommend a repairer in the uk /is
it worth it? -it just looks so right in the dash and a new one would
necessitate cutting the dash -thanx Martin and by the way i don't know if
thanked Steve Dworkin (I think thats how you spell your name)for the help
with the slider  the pics made sense of it and helped no end-cheers .
