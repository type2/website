Subject: [T2] drum brakes &gt; disc brakes?

Hi, I'm just wondering if anyone has converted their drum brakes into disc
brakes?  I know they have kits for beetle's, but unsure about the bus. If
you have done this, how hard of a job is it, and around what cost.

as always, thanks in advance.

happy busing,
Keri
