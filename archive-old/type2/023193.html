Subject: free westy seats!
Mime-Version: 1.0

Ladies and gentlemen!

I luckily found some killer seats for my 75 Westy this weekend.  I managed 
to find a pair of seats from a Mitsubishi Montaro at a junkyard with lumbar 
support and no tears that can easily be modified to be installed in my 
bus.  (happy butt....)

So....I have 2 front seats from a 75 Westy with orange plaid interior that 
need a home.  These seats need some lovin'...that I just wasn't willing to 
give.  They need new upholstery and some cushioning.  The headrests are 
orange and fully intacted with no tears.

I live in Northern Va...the seats are in Vienna, VA to be exact.  Anyone 
that would like them is welcome to pick them up.  Please email me off list 
if you are interested.
