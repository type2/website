Subject: RE: [T2] Overhead Consoles

&gt; I have an electric one that I purchased at Sam's Club for $60.  It has the
&gt; same technology that is used by GM in their cars.  It works great.  It also
&gt; gives inside and outside temperature, altitude and barometric pressure.  The
&gt; compass is very accurate, the only downside is that it needs to be
&gt; calibrated about once every two weeks.  Not hard to calibrate, you just have
&gt; to drive the bus around in circles for about a minute.  I really like it.
&gt; The one that I purchased came with suction cups to mount to the window and
&gt; it looks pretty cool sitting up just barely over the dash.

On trips I keep my Garmin eMap mounted on the dash and plugged into the cig
lighter. I also have an external antenna and get locks on 6-7 satellites.
Gives me compass, accurate time, speed, location. Plus, the eMap hold data
from MetroGuide - so I can find the closest pizza place. It also answers my
daughter's constant 'how much farther' queries by setting the destination and
having it navigate (doesn't do fancy route optimizations and my daughter
hasn't realized that the distance to go is 'as the crow flies' or that the ETA
changes in both directions).

What would be great would be a better mount for my 12V fan, a ceiling mount
for the Garmin, and some CD storage space. I'm thinking an appropriately cut
piece of plywood. I'll use pine first and redo in Baltic Birch on the second
pass...
