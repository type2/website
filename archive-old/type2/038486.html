Subject: '69 electrical....FIXED!!! Well, mostly;-)

All,


Thought I'd share the news that I diagnosed/fixed a
few nagging electrical problems on my '69 Westy.

The dash-light problems turned out to be related to
the bulb installation. The new bulbs just don't fit
the same as the old ones, and several hadn't seated
properly in the plugs. Aaarrrrgh! Why can't they leave
a good thing alone, and *not* redesign it????

The right-rear brake/turn-signal issue was finally
remedied by playing with the ground;-\ I had cleaned
*all* of the connectors, grounds, etc, and even
checked the wiring itself, but it all seemed to be in
order; nothing helped. 

It turned out that the ground to the tailight assembly
*was* good, but that the assembly itself was not
grounding to the bulb-socket!


While there were some minor frustrations getting all
of this straightened out, it sure feels good to
accomplish so much with so little money ($9.00 for all
new dash lightbulbs)!

I still have *no* idea what the 2 mystery wires I
encounterd were for. Both were original, disconnected
(cut, actually), black, 14g wires; one connected to
the fuse furthest from the door, the other connected
to my head light switch. Repeated checks of my Bentley
showed *no* black wires in these locations (I even
checked all the way through '71)! Any ideas on this
one????


TIA.
