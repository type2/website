&gt;Everything set up and adjusted and tuned per Bentley. A Type IV motor
&gt;cannot run better than this. Soooooo nice. So I followed up and put on new

Sure it can, that is why god gave us Bosch fuel injection.  All new FI parts
wouldn't have required a bit of adjustment 8-)  Yeah they would have cost
a bit more...
