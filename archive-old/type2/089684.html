Subject: Distributor Rebuild - A Resource!

Hiya List,

Yesterday I posted a general question to the List concerning rebuilding a 
distributor.  In short I wanted to know if there was a &quot;renewal&quot; kit or a 
business which would refurbish old distributors.  To those (Steve, Eron, Jay) 
who filled me in on the Bosch kit, my thanks.

Not knowing just where to start looking for &quot;distributor renewer&quot; I checked 
my local yellow pages.  I found an outfit called Philbin Manufacturing (check 
'em out at www.philbingroup_dot_com) and low and behold, they do remanufacture 
distributors.  And they do Volkswagen/Bosch distributors.  &quot;Neat&quot;, I thought. 
 They even had a listing for my Bus (69-70).  Although I was a little 
suspicious because this distributor was listed as having other applications, 
so I was wondering if it was really a 205T.  So, I went on over to see these 
folks this morning.

When I told the counterman what I needed he pulled out what looked to be a 
brand new 205T.  &quot;Wow&quot;, says I.  It is really a nice piece of work complete 
with points and condenser.  He looks up the price - $58.80 with a core charge 
of $5.00.

Folks, I have not yet installed this &quot;new&quot; distributor but I have to say I 
was very impressed with the workmanship.  And, what's more, Philbin will 
renew your old core.  So if you're doing a resto to stock this is a place you 
might want to check out.  This turned out to be a great resource and these 
guys are right in my back yard.  Give them a &quot;look-see&quot;.

Mike
