Subject: RE: [T2] Are replacement body panels larger than the old ones?

Volkswarenhaus_dot_de shows them as available: front pair EUR 331.90, rear (NOS
VW) also EUR 331.90. If they have them, there are probably other suppliers
as well. I imagine that these would tough to find on this side of the
Atlantic though.

Does anyone know if repair panels for the cargo bed of the 68-79
single/double cabs are still available?
