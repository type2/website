Subject: HUD definition of a rec. vehicle

While researching the ability to use satellite TV in our VW camper, I 
found one must prove the posession of a recreational vehicle before 
being allowed national feeds to your account.  Knowing this is relevant 
to those of you insuring your camper and getting flak about &quot;bathrooms 
and kitchens&quot; in your bus, here is the official HUD description:
(Title 24 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 3282.8) defines 
&quot;recreational vehicle&quot; as a vehicle that is: (1) built on a single 
chassis; (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest 
horizontal projections; (3) self-propelled or permanently towable by a 
light duty truck; and (4)designed primarily not for use as a permanent 
dwelling but as a temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, 
travel, or seasional use.&quot;  I'd say we do that in a lot of if not most 
of our busses.  Hmmmmmmm-&quot;living quarters&quot;- where you can prepare food, 
sleep, relax, and dig out the portapotti?
    BTW, you can still take your receiver out on the road and get 
everthing but national networks for free, and not buy a fancy portable 
dish- got a dish with LNB and post arm (easily adaptable to a ground 
plate) for $15 on *-bay.
