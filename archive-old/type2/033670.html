Subject: I had to tell someone

hey all
first engine pull on Stella tonight went with success! I finally got the
nootz to do it and I found out a few bad things.  I'm changing my clutch
pp and disc.  my old pp had no ring on it where it meets up to the TO
bearing.  ouch.  no springs as in a 9 or 6 spring plate either.  just
the bailing wire type.  some of the nuts on it were loose too. ouch.
I'm putting on new heater boxes as one is making a really bad exhaust
leak.  I'm going out to do that now.

I just had to tell someone!

tis kinda fun.

weird eh? you thought I'd have something better to do on a Friday
night.. lol!

later
