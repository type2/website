Subject: Re: [T2] Tape Deck for My 79

In a message dated 5/13/03 2:00:16 AM, wharfrat_at_spiritone_dot_com writes:

&lt;&lt; Hey All,

Beyond the garage sale circuit, can anyone recommend a starting point for

finding a good new or used cassette deck for my 79 bus?  I have a Sony in

there but the tape deck portion has since ceased to operate, and I'd rather

not replace it with another Sony due to the crappy luck I've had with that

brand's products.  I don't want to deal with any of the fancy newish

stereos, as they seem now to require more complicated multiple ground wiring

and no one seems to make straight simple tape decks anymore anyway.  I'm

assuming an older Blaupunkt might fit and work....does anyone know of any

other brands of tape decks that will go right into the stock radio hole for

a 79? &gt;&gt;

Try  &lt;&lt;  www.partsexpress_dot_com  &gt;&gt;  to see what's on special.
Or any of the big electronics chains to see when last year's
models go on sale.
