&gt; The AFM stops the fuel ? - only after the engine stops!
&gt; Just because it is on fire doesn't mean it stops!

&gt; stop.

this is correct, too
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Tim has the best point yet. 
&gt; The best fire fighting system in the world 
&gt; is a system that prevents the fire from starting. 

&gt; I've never heard of a bus catching fire that didn't involve old fuel hoses 
&gt; breaking, or the brass fuel inlet pipe falling out of the carb???
&gt; Fix it first, and don't worry about Halon systems.

I had a type IV engine catch fire when the cold start valve malfunctioned
and continued dumping fuel into the engine, fire started in the air box,
spread to rest of engine compartment, (engine continued to run) was in
Downtown DC and people on the street alerted me, fortunately my fire Ext
and someone who stopped put the fire out quite quickly.  insurance paid
for the repairs and I was back on the road in less than a week, next to
mine in the dealers yard was another FI engined VW that was totaled by
fire.
