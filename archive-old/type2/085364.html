&gt; I have fitted 009 distributor (electronic ignition totally stuffed) - anyone
&gt; know the optimum the contact gap setting, and how to keep it there?

Dave,
As others have pointed out, this sounds like more of a distributor problem.
The points gap should be 0.016 to 0.020 (about 0.5mm) but the best way of
setting it is to measure the dwell with a dwell meter.  It should be pretty
close to 50 degrees and should not vary (much) with engine speed or jump
around.
