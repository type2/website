&gt; I knew I would need your help. My son's 78 westy has had an engine 
&gt; transplant.
&gt; I am not sure what was supposed to be in there or what is now in there.
&gt; the VIN from the door is 2382147141
&gt; I found a code on some of the duct it had a number on it: CB022377
&gt; what is this code?
&gt; The motor does NOT have a doghouse.
&gt; The Alternator is next to the crank pulley.
&gt; It uses an electric fuel pump.

Probably an old stolen Tatra engine... ;-)
