The Folly has yet to be on the road... however I enjoy sneaking her around
the block from time to time.  Now The Folly has developed a problem that
will sound familiar.  She has lost power... and I think it could be a carb
related problem.  

She is slow to increase her rpms.  That is at idle, I press the accelerator
and she reluctantly increases revs.  She has to be revving in a high range
before she will move.  No guts.

Any suggestions as to what to look for???

Please and Thank yous always!

Barry
