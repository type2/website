Here is a quote from www.bus-boys_dot_com:


Idle Stabilizer Control Box - Also Called The &quot;DLS&quot; Box

The DLS Unit/Idle Stabilizer is usually located on the left engine wall next 
to the Ignition Control Module and has Round Plug Connectors.

Because of the lean conditions associated with the emissions controls on 
your California Model Vanagon, without this unit, your idle sometimes 
&quot;hunts&quot;, going up and down. When it fails, the engine won't start or run 
usually.

Maintenance Tip: If equipped with this device, never try to time your engine 
with it connected. The timing mark at idle jumps all over the place. Before 
timing the engine, shut it off, disconnect the round plugs from the unit, 
then connect the plugs together, start the engine, be sure idle is at 
factory specs, set your timing accordingly, then turn off engine and 
reconnect your Idle Stabilizer. ..
