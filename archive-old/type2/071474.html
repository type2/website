Hi Meredith;
I hope your burn isn't too bad.  I've seen oil get upwards of 270 degree F 
and that can cause a really bad burn.
Pinging in an air cooled engine is DEADLY.  NEVER let your air-cooled engine 
ping.  Preignition, pinging, causes hot spots and will destroy your engine 
real fast.  I know from experience on this one.
Use at least mid grade, 89 octane, fuel.
The thing that kills bus engines in most cases is excess heat.  That little 
air cooled engine is pushing a big brick through the air and it has a hard 
time keeping it's self cool.
It sounds to me like your engine got too hot.  You may have warped a head and 
that is the &quot;chirping&quot; sound you are hearing.  In other words you now have a 
compression leak between the top of the cylinder and the head.
If you want your engine to last put a CHT gauge on it.  Be sure to install it 
properly and check to see that it's accurate.  This is only way you're going 
to know how hot your engine is.  An oil temp gauge is better than nothing, 
but they are much slower to react.  Also most sending units for oil temp 
gauges measure the case temperature because they are engineered by morons.  
Or should I say greedy dishonest morons.
I can send more info on how to install a CHT gauge if your interested.  
You should probably check your compression.  If my hypothesis about a warped 
head is right you will have low compression on one or more cylinders.  I hope 
I'm wrong.
