That was funny Ken, but true, very true.

To answer the first question without suggesting an inline 4, Mazda rotary, or
subaru which might all be good solutions.

If you got $4000 to blow and want to blow it on a T4 engine, talk to FAT
Performance.  Don't bother Eurorace, Audrics, Stephens when he resurfaces,
whoever.

FAT.

Be prepared to spend the full $4k, probably just on a 2.0 or maybe on 2055
with
96mm overbore.  And I'd get a real careful guarantee that THEY will set up
your
stock L-jet to run the engine, cause they are going to claim you can but
reality
may not be exactly the same thing (I speak of some experience here.)

Still for the parts, though at somewhat of a premium compared to what they
might actually be worth, you aren't going to beat the quality or find anyone
bad mouthing them.  But it costs money.  Heads worked over on new German
cores about $1500 the set, crank probably $500-600, barrels $500 or so,
you get the idea of how this all ads up.

Something else, $4000 would buy a pretty fair lowish mileage Porsche 2.4 or
2.7 and the stuff to get it in the car.  A lot of listees in the day did it
for a lot
less than that, but $4000 should probably buy something with a set of carbs
that has more than 50k life left in it.  And it will be a heck of a lot
faster than
any T4.  You might get away a lot less, last spring at Manassas a guy had
a 2.7 with a set of carbs sitting there for $1500/obo, it looked, well it was
there and he claimed it had good compression and ran well.

Some thoughts, I love the T4 but there are DEFINITELY limits.
I will soon report on what a set of 96 NPR big bores does for the '82 but
won't have it long enough to find out about their long term reliability (which
has always been said to be their downfall.)
