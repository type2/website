Subject: Re: [T2] push-rod retaining wires


&gt; Does anyone Know what purpose the push rod retaining wire serves?

You almost answered this question yourself: &quot;push rod retaining wire&quot;.... put
the word 'tube' between 'rod' and 'retaining'.
They hold the pushrod TUBES in place

&gt;I've got a
&gt; 75 bus and I noticed that the wire is wearing a grove into the push-rods.
&gt; One rod was worn dangerously deep (about an 1/8th&quot; all around). I'm assuming
&gt; that I installed the wire incorrectly but I can't find anything that
&gt; explains how it should sit in the head.

If they are touching any pushrods....they are installed wrong.

&gt;Should this wire be in contact with
&gt; the underside of the push-rods? Mine are.

NO! They hook on each end into the rocker arm support. Then each bend goes into
the head at the top of each tube.
Got a 68-79 Bentley? Go to section 5, page 32, fig. 10 - 4. Kinda sucks but that
is about all there is...... If you back up a page, you will see it in the
exploded pic as # 32. The bottom right pic shows the correct position of the
rocker arm supports. I have taken quite a few engines apart and they were upside
down. They really mangled the wire trying to get it to stay in.....
