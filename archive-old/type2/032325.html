&gt; Another ? - according to the VIN, my bus is a Kombi, but everything
&gt; I read about them is that they should have two bench seats.  My bus
&gt; has the table and rear folding bed/seat with a top mounted rear
&gt; &quot;cabinet&quot;.  It also has louvered windows.  Is this a Kombi or did
&gt; someone in the past try to make it a &quot;pseudo- camper&quot;.

Having just aquired a 1969 Campmobile myself, I've been learning about
all this stuff too. 

From what I've been able to gather, VW Campers start out as Kombi's
(Type 237), then are sent over to Westfalia Werke and outfitted with
the camping equipment. I wasn't aware that they sold many non-poptop
campers in this country, but it apparently seems to be true. I'm
starting to notice quite a few.
