Subject: Re: [T2] Keeping a bus from being stolen

FYI This is not the perfect solution but....

I found that the lock mechanism for the back hatch will
fit into the engine door.  Yes dont put an ugly padlock
on it!

I got the key mechanism from a wrecked 71 gutted the
tumbler, got it re-keyed to the main key and installed
it into the engine door lock.  I honestly dont remember
how I put it in step by step, but I remember thinking
it was almost made for the assembly.  Try it you'll
like it.

The only &quot;issue&quot; is that the key turns under instead of
over.
