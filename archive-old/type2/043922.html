&gt; Unfortunately, I've neither the time nor money to turn back now.  Once
&gt; installed, I'm taking it to a local shop for fine tuning.  I'm just hoping
&gt; it gets me the 1800 miles to Colorado.

&gt; Thanks for the scoop.  Boy, did I have a funny feeling in my stomach after
I
&gt; looked through the archives.

Mark,

Good Luck.

When AVP rebuilt my engine, they were able to get me some warranty credit
from GEX.

Also, if it makes you feel any better, a very small and quiet minority of
people have had good luck with the GEX engines.

Make sure that (1) ALL of the cooling tin is in place, (2) that there is a
seal around the perimeter of the engine hole, and that (3) the warm up flaps
are working properly and you should be OK. Any one of these three things
being wrong will destroy (overheat) the engine pronto.

TAKE PICTURES OF THE FINISHED INSTALLATION FOR WARRANTY PROOF.

There is a small dime sized metal heat sensor on the case of the engine that
either gets a hole in the middle or falls off if the engine is overheated.
GEX will use this as evidence that you incorrectly installed the engine
causing it to overheat and fail, so you need pictures of a properly
installed engine to back up your claim.

Protect yourself, and the List will stand behind you.
