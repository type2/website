Will be held at the Piney Woods Campground between Dublin and Glenwood 
Georgia on December 10th, 11th, and 12th.  camping will be 10 bucks a 
night with electricity, 5 without.  

I am going to cook a turkey and eat it on  Saturday whether anyone shows 
or not.  Andy Pechnik says he is going to try and make it up from Miami, 
and Dave Easterwood says he is going to check his schedule.  if any of 
you want to join me in this culinary giving thanks endeavor please come 
on down.  It will be good to see ya and we (I) will be glad to have ya.

bring your kids, bring your guitars, bring yourself.  It will be simple, 
quiet, and easy with conversation around a fire and the south Georgia sky 
shining above.  Life will be simple in south Georgia, the way God 
intended it to be.  I might even have us a Christmas tree.  : )

As time goes by I will post more direct directions.  Essentially the 
campground is just a couple miles south of  I-16 on Hwy 19 around Dublin 
Ga.

Thanks,
Charlie Ford
