I'm stuck trying to re-assemble Pumpkin II...

I'm out of time, and need to get the door rubber
installed so my wife can drive the thing...

I got a quote to clean all the channels out (front
doors, sliding door, rear hatch, engine lid), prime,
paint, and install the rubber (I'm providing the
rubber).  A reputable shop wants wants $1900.00...does
this sound reasonable (I'm in SOCAL, so make allowance
for EVERYTHING being more expensive).


Also, my OEM front door rubber pieces are too large,
ie some of the straight runs are too long.  Looks like
it would be simple to cut and splice to shorten them,
but are they supposed to be too long?

Thanks
