&gt; you don't have to find a whole new replacement stub axle. use a &quot;nut

Actually, I've had success using a O/A torch to cut the nut off the
spindle.  With care, you can do it and not damage the harder steel of the
spindle underneath...


later...david (i did not intend on salvaging the spindle, btw...i just
needed to get the hub off...spindle was fine, though.)
