&gt;12V to coil when key is on. Checked lead from condenser to (--) side of coil
&gt;- found juice there whether points are open, closed, etc.
&gt;     I have rechecked points with feeler again

test lite at both sides of the point gap will reveal function. greasy feeler gauge
will mess it up every time.

&gt;    The only consistent things is that when I have no spark, there is:
&gt;    1) Always 12V to coil when key is on
&gt;    2) Always power on other side of coil too.  (Test light glows on both
&gt;sides of coil)

to test point side with a lite you need to test thru the point gap. the condenser
capacitor function can be tested with a multimeter,
