Hello all! I haven't been able to get a post through in a couple weeks 
because my yahoo mail account freaked out on me, oh well. I've been reading 
about the bus show 2 weeks from now in Prescott and I'm definetly planning 
to go. So I am interested in finding out who else is going to leave on Sat 
and if we are gonna go as a caravan. These trips are always 10 times better 
that way! Well... ok let me know whoever is in charge k? thanks!
