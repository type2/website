Subject: Full width stock z-bed for a '71 bus?
Message-ID: &lt;372CD571.3829_at_worldnet.att_dot_net&gt;

A question for y'all:

Was there ever a full width pullout bed (z-bed?) that came stock on a 71
bus?  If so, does anybody have one they want to sell?  Or will I have to
resort to an aftermarket kit z-bet conversion?

Thanks,

Lauria Watts
