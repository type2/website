Victor Martino sends:

&gt;&gt; About the fire hazard, back when the Indy 500 was run by USA and all these
&gt;&gt; cars carried up to 50-70 gallons of gas and hit a wall they turned into
&gt;&gt; incendiary bombs and the safety crews did not carry Halon or Carbon Dioxide
&gt;&gt; extinguishers just water which in turn spread the water. So in 1963 or there
&gt;&gt; abouts they changed to methanol which is not as explosive and CAN be put out
&gt;&gt; with water as it is not a petroleum product. I saw this in two CART races
&gt;&gt; this year as his pit crew (and the one next to his) doused the driver
&gt;&gt; (Christen Fittapaldi) with water. Now for other reasons you do not want to
&gt;&gt; pour water on the car as water tends to do more harm after the fire is out. A
&gt;&gt; good carbon dioxide (or foam) extinguisher will smother the fire by
&gt;&gt; displacing all the oxygen while not destroying equipment.........  now I'm no
&gt;&gt; expert...this is just my opinion.

Uhh...Victor...you seem to have missed the point here.

Alcohol flames are invisible. Not only can't you see them, neither can the
fire department. Which means that a small fuel-only fire that would have
been easily contained may become a fuel-plus-Bus fire before you realize
there's any fire at all back there.

One other problem in alcohol-burning vehicles: alcohol has fewer BTUs per
gallon than does gasoline. IIRC, it's 90,000 BTUs for alcohol and 150,000
for gas. You will therefore need more alcohol than gasoline to go the same
distance.
