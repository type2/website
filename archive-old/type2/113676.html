Any advice would be appreciated. Sorry for writing a book - I seem to always
do that.

Hello Bill.....I used a grinder to take metal off the exhaust header, to 
shrink the size of the outside footprint, so it would have more wiggle room 
and clearance going onto the studs. Probably took off a 1/16 of an inch all 
around. Didn't really measure. Just worked at it until it fit.

I also mildly reamed the holes in the header (that the studs go through) 
just enough.

These processes made the job MUCH easier, compared to impossible. Used a 
disc sander with a stiff commercial grit HD carbide disc first, and 
finished up with a Dremel that was set up to grind metal. My headers were 
stainless steel (76 Westy with original engine.) I held the header on the 
ground with my foot to do the grinding most of the time, and wore goggles. 
Suggest a vice with wooden jaws, if you have one available.

On one of the cylinders, I took one stud out and fitted the header into the 
slot, and then threaded in the stud (with two nuts on the end to give me 
something to wrench.) That was the only way I could get that last one to 
fit. I used Permatex Hi-Temp, a 2000 degree ceramic based metal repair 
compound, to seal the copper header gaskets. It is holding up so far.

Hope I'm addressing the problem that you described.
