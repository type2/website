Subject: Re: [T2] Re: what engine is this?

IF YOU NOTICE ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE ENGINE LID THERE IS A &quot;KEP&quot; STICKER
WHICH IS THE SAME EMBLEM SEEN AT THE KENNEDY ENGINEERING SITE, THE PLACE
THAT SELLS THE CONVERSION KIT.  THE FUNNY THING IS THE SUBARU ENGINES OF
THAT ERA ARE THE &quot;PANCAKE&quot; STYLE LIKE THE BUS ENGINES.  MY GUESS IS IT IS
PROBABLY THE SUBARU 2.1L ENGINE.  IF THE STICKER HOLDS TRUE THEN AT LEAST
YOU KNOW IT IS A SPECIFIC CONVERSION FOR THE BUS.
