Hi Jim,

how valuable is your time?  If you were careful enough not to let any 
dirt get in between the cylinders and the case, then I would just leave
well enough alone. The question is how easy it will be to remove the
carbon with the piston and cylinder still attached. (Also, when removing
the carbon, be sure not to scratch the piston too much.) 

If you decide to get new rings anyway, then you will also have to have 
the cylinders rehoned. The machine shop can look at the p/c's and 
actually tell you if you can keep them or not. (Btw, I suspect they will
be biased towards rehoning as they will make more money on labor than on
the sales markup).  The shop can also bead blast your pistons, saving 
you a lot of work. 

Have fun!

Sami
