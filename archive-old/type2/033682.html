Subject: eccentric camber bushing

I checked the archives, it seems like a pickle fork is the only way to get 
the eccentric bushing off the ball joint, but mine are really stuck (I'm only 
replacing the boots) and i worry that i might hurt the ball joint itself by 
the force of  banging w/ a big hammer on the bushing. can i do that--- or 
better yet, is there a better way?
this is the last hurdle in getting our 69 back on the road!
