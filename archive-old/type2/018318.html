Makes perfect sense--I really couldn't figure out Bentley's illustration.

OK--I've got no rod and no shutter. It doesn't appear to be an easy sort of
installation, at least not until the engine is out. This looks to me as if
it is a &quot;wait 'till the engine blows&quot; type of repair...will the absence of
these parts greatly shorten the time until I need to replace them?

(I'm in CA where a thermo may not be as necessary as for someone in VA.)
