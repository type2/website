Subject: Re: [T2] CB Radio Antenna install

You can think of your bus as one big ground.  If you
want the maximum transmission, you want the antenna on
top of the bus.  CB is considered low frequencey. In
the 10 Meter HF band. Even though it is in the HF
spectrum, it is low compared to 2 meters and other
UHF/VHF frequencies.  Because of the propogation
pattern, much of your transmission will be absorbed by
the body of the bus.  Put the antenna on top and
you'll get 100% propogation if your antenna is at
resonance.  Which most CB anteenae are.  The higher
the frequency, the less the bus itself has to do with
it.  At low frequencies, it is very critical. 
Cheers....KR

&gt; So .. I recently installed a CB Radio Antenna on the
&gt; rear bumper of my 78. 
&gt; I got this mirror mount thing at Flying J's for like
&gt; $11.00.  I threw away 
&gt; half of it and the other half mounted nicely in one
&gt; of those holes that are 
&gt; on the bottom of my rear bumper.  The mount sticks
&gt; out about 1 1/2&quot; from my 
&gt; rear bumper.  I had a fiberglass antenna that
&gt; screwed right in.  It only 
&gt; goes as high as the rain gutter of my roof and so
&gt; ... is about 6&quot; or so 
&gt; shorter than the top of my pop-top.  I haven't wired
&gt; it up yet and I'm 
&gt; hopefull that I can squeeze the cable through the
&gt; front without drilling a 
&gt; hole.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway - so - will this antenna work properly - or
&gt; optimally - I kinda doubt 
&gt; it but ... if not what should I do ... get a longer
&gt; antenna that goes about 
&gt; my pop-top? ... if so how high should it go ... 6&quot;
&gt; or 3' or what?
&gt;
