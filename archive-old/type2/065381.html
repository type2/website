Subject: header wrap question

Hi again. In my seemingly endless quest to improve engine cooling, I have
noticed that the rear apron and bottom of the engine compartment get
_really_ hot in my '66 Kombi. The bottom of the engine compartment isn't
too bad, but I have been burnt several times by inadvertently touching the
rear apron. I have a 1600 dp engine with J-tubes and a merged exhaust. Has
anyone had a similar problem, and how did you resolve it? I vaguely
remember someone on the vintagvw list discussing header wrap as an option.
Pros? Cons? Indifference? I would greatly appreciate any opinions on this
subject. Thanks in advance,

P. S. I hope to start painting within a couple of weeks. The body work is
coming along nicely. Luckily, the only rust problem is in the battery tray,
but I have collision damage to the driver's side door and dogleg, as well
as the rear corners. In addition, a PO mangled the passenger side air
intake in an aborted attempt at mounting an external oil cooler, I presume.
I guess I could always remount the air scoop, right? Flame away, but I'm a
bondo-ing fool right now. I hope to finish it before the fumes finish me
;).
