Ok Volks.. here's my story.  I'd been planning on buying a '68 Type 2
w/camping gear this week, and on Tuesday I took it to a mechanic to get it
checked out.  Not my usual mechanic though, as he's really busy.  So
anyways everything checks out ok EXCEPT that the frame (girder) is really
rusty and beginning to fall apart. I've been trying to get a hold of a
friend who is a licenced mechanic and specializes in VW's but he hasn't
called back.

Surely a few of you, especially those with VW's dating back to the early
50's have run into a rusted frame.  Is this the end? Can a good welder
repair it and make it better than new? Any idea what this would cost? I can
probably get this thing for like $700 Cdn which is like $550 US.  Is this a
good price? It needs a new muffler, but other than that there's nothing
obviously wrong (this week) 8^).  Any other VW-specific questions I should
ask?
