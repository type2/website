&gt; Now I know I just opened a rattlesnake mess by saying left rear to left

tire makers all say, criss cross bias ply tires, do not cross
radials.  radial tires take a set and should always rotate in the same
direction,

&gt; tires and make it the spare. Now install all new four tires.

that's usually how I do it also
