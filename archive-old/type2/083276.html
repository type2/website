Subject: 009 etc.

&lt;&lt; &quot;If the .009 is obviously bad, then why the
hell does nearly everyone with a T1 engine in an
early bay have this set-up?!?!?!&quot;  

Cheap and easy.  And chrome and cool transparent
caps.  And Hot VW's promotes them (because their
advertisers sell them).  

&gt;Muir has a lot to do with it

Muir said vacuum dizzies suck, errr, aren't good
because they have improper curves.  And he's
right.  But he was talking about the old vacuum
only dizzies on some 60's VW's.  They had no
centrifugal advance.  I'd take a 010 or 009 over
these also.

Dual Advance (as in Single Vacuum Dual Advance or
Dual Vacuum Dual Advance dizzies) of all sorts
combine what should be obvious.  You need more
advance as your rpm's increase and you need more
advance as you increase the throttle (and
increase vacuum).  

No one said the Boston Bob couldn't make the 009
run cool-- which is all that matters with respect
to warranty.  We are saying you cannot get
optimum mpg and throttle response with one of
those pieces of crap.  

009's are ok I guess if you have a type 1 engine
and run it wide open throttle and keep the rpm's
up (lower gears).  I'm sure this applies to the
splittie guys.  It doesn't apply to me.  I run
about 1/4 throttle and keep it cool.  I had no
trouble keeping up with the dual port busses and
couldn't keep up with vanagons even at WOT.

But... lets get over this argument.  Some newbies
will run weber progressives designed for a 8
cylinder despite the black soot on their bumpers
and poor mpg (and eventually dead engines), will
run passenger tires with 1300 max loads, and will
run 009's despite the throttle lag no matter what
we say.
