&gt; There's a couple of different issues going on here.
&gt;
&gt; First, as the bolt starts to work loose, oil will begin to leak. When the
&gt; bolt falls out completely, oil will pour out of the bolt hole. This oil
&gt; would likely end up on the exhaust, being a possible source of the smoke.
&gt; How much oil was still in the engine when you stopped?

??? are you sure, I had no oil at all come out of mine when it fell off,.
and when I checked I still had an engine full of synthetic 15W-50

&gt; Second, the pulley will not necessarily come off as soon as the bolt comes
&gt; out. The woodruff key will continue to drive the pulley as long as the
&gt; pulley remains on the crankshaft. So the pulley itself may not have come off
&gt; until near the time you stopped. Mine did not come off at all. Luckily I
&gt; spotted it before I lost much oil.

probably true, although mine came off almost immediately, since the bolt
fell into the fan it made enough noise for a couple seconds until the
pully came off.  and very luckily the bolt was laying nicely in the fan
when I got stopped so I didn't even have to search for it on the road.

&gt; So the amount of engine damage sustained will depend on whether the primary
&gt; problem was oil starvation or cooling air starvation. If you ran it out of

neither or both...stopping the engine immediatle is the key.

they don't call them Idjiot lights fer nothing.
