Subject: oil leak of the damned

IF I remember correctly, there is an oil drain hole behind the seal that is
supposed to let the oil coming out of the rear main to drain back to the
sump. When you replaced the seal did you inspect this hole for something
clogging it up? It may be that when the case halves were sealed up and
bolted together maybe some sealer partialy blocked the drain. Over time this
could cause a collection point for any crud in the oil, eventualy causing
complete blockage. If oil can not drain from this area you would have a
build up of pressure behind the seal. I am supprised your new seal hasn't
failed if this is the case.

I'm thinking if you remove the seal, you should be able to use a piece of
stiff wire threaded down the drain hole to check for clog. I have a
disassembled case in my shed so I will take a look to make sure this is
reasonable advise and get back to you.
I hope this helps,
Tom
