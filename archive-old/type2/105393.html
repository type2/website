Subject: Re: Engine switchout

From: &quot;daniel nelson&quot; &lt;danielbnelson_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

&gt;&gt;I have a 1970 1600 single port going into a 1971 bus.

&gt;I have a 71 Westy and it has a 1600 single port that came from a 70 bus, it 
&gt;should fit ok, sometimes when getting the engine back in i have to jack up 
&gt;the tranny a little bit.

Same here - 1600SP in a 71 westy and other than the clutch components I can't think of anything else different.  I have the same experience as Dan 
- sometimes it's a bear getting the tranny lined up with engine at the same point where engine will clear mustache bar mounts and get everything 
parallel.  I just try to make sure the engine's not binding on anything going in -- make sure you can turn it, check to make sure input shaft is centered, 
etc.   A couple of times it has just played hard to get and then would finally slide in the last inch or half-inch like &quot;What?  Me difficult?&quot;  I think maybe 
it just likes to hear my vocabulary....
