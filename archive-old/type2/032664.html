Subject: Re: stuck adjusting stars

I'm afraid it's time to pull the drums, remove the shoes, and take the
adjusters out. If they're frozen, don't use plyers or vice-grips: an elegant
way to extract them out of the bore is to screw in a long bolt (I *think*
size M8). When the bolt bottoms out in the bore, it will push out the
adjuster.  Then clean out and sand/hone the bore. (I painted the inside of
mine with POR-15.) New adjusters can be obtained for cheap at Bus Depot for
example, or you can try to reuse the old ones after a little sanding. I put
a dab of sparkplug antiseize into the bore and on the adjusters' threads
before putting everything back together.
