Subject: Assun Brown paint code? / Oil light with ebrake

Happy Friday Everyone!!
I'm the new owner of an 80 Westy (p-22) model and I know that it is the assun brown paint but I can't find the code. While I'm here My oil light comes on when I put the ebrake on.  If the ebrake is not on it works like it should any suggestion just replace the oil pressure switch?  I did just put a new used alternator in it but it did this before that anyway.
Thanks
Kevin
