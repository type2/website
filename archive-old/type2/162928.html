Subject: Re: [T2] 78 FI 2.0lt dies at higher RPM's

&gt;20lt. fuel injected bus  runs and idles fine but as soon as it hits  about 45
&gt;mph it dies out.
&gt;
&gt;compression checks out fine, it looks to have new fuel pump. has also had 
&gt;complete tune-up
&gt;
&gt;Any thoughts to what would cause this would be appreciated.

	A clogged fuel filter can act just like the old governors on 
rental cars  -  motor stumbles severely when you raise cruise speed 
above a given value  -  say 45 mph.  Ease off and the motor resumes.
	Does yours recover reliably when you slow to, say, 40 mph?
