Subject: [T2] Bypass wiper switch(es)

Looks like my wiper switch has grown tired and will not power the motor unless
manually held to a position other than it's normal resting position. Has anyone
used standard rocker type (or similar) switches to bypass the steering
column-mounted unit (which is also not cheap).

Thanks in advance,
