&gt; &gt; What kind of clamps are people using for 5mm carb fuel line?
&gt;
&gt; I use the stainless ones, they are called ABA and are Swedish (yes really!).
&gt; They come in just about any metric size but I think the correct size is 13,
&gt; which translates to 11-13mm.  You will probably find that the next size up
&gt; fits as well.

I very strongly agree with Mr. Horrigan! A picture of the ABA clamps can
be seen at:

http://www.western-marine_dot_com/page118.htm

The correct clamps are labeled &quot;mini clamps&quot; and are on the left (Dave, I
hope these are what you are referring to!). While the 13's will work, I
tend to use the 11's rather than the 13's as I find that the 13's close
all the way before getting snug.  The 11's are very snug to get over any
&quot;swell&quot;  in the pipe, however and have to be assembled carefully.  I would
love to try the 12's as I think they would be ideal but all my suppliers
carry the odd-number sizes only.

OOK!
