Subject: garage in Jacksonville North Carolina
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello list,

I wanted to see if any body has heard of a small vw
garage that is located in the entrance of
Jacksonville, North Carolina. The shop is called COX
MOTOR CO. I went to investigate the other day but it
was the weekend and they were closed. They had several
old bay windows, and many other old beetles, dune
buggies, ect. I don't know if they part out any of
these vehicles or if they were just for sale or what.
Let me know if any one has heard of them. I will have
to go investigate again when they are open.
Thanks for your time!

David Kelly
