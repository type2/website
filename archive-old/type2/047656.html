Well...

The dilemma continues.

On the Mr. Heater page for their &quot;Portable Buddy&quot; they specifically state
that it is safe and OK for use in an enclosed space like a camper or tent.
They say it's &quot;Designed and approved for indoor use&quot;.

    http://www.mrheater_dot_com/buddy2.htm

They also say:

    &quot;Certified by CSA International (American Gas Association), Mr. Heater's
Portable Buddy heater uses revolutionary new heating technology to provide
safe, reliable propane heat indoors. The Buddy gives you instant heat
anytime!&quot;

On their site home page they have a link to their industry association,
&quot;Coalition For Portable Propane Safety&quot; &lt;  http://www_dot_campheater_dot_org/  &gt;.
The Coalition's home page states clearly:

    &quot;WARNING:

Although portable radiant gas heaters are great for outside use, they are
not appropriate for use inside tents, RV's, campers, vehicles or enclosed
shelters. Since a portable radiant heater consumes air (oxygen), using a
portable gas heater, regardless of size, inside any enclosed area poses the
threat of carbon monoxide poisoning.

ALWAYS USE PORTABLE RADIANT GAS HEATERS OUTSIDE!&quot;

The format and emphasis is the Coalition's.

I am still amazed that Mr. Heater so clearly contradicts their own
association [or vice versa] on such a critical issue.  By the way, Coleman
is apparently also a member of the coalition.

Who should we believe?  Is there some truly independent authority
[Consumer's Union, perhaps?] on this issue?

Every year Washington state has deaths from carbon monoxide, caused by using
various combustion devices [including propane heaters] in an enclosed space
while sleeping.  It happens in tents in spring and summer, pickup campers
and trailers in the winter, and aboard moored boats all year round.
Frequently victims have made an effort to provide safe ventilation, and they
still died.

I'm still searching for a definitive answer.  If this thread is tiresome,
I'm sorry.  I want everyone to sleep warm and cozy in their Westies, etc.
this winter.  I do not want any List-members harmed in their efforts to do
so.

FWIW.....

&gt;  I too am interested in staying warm and really appreciate you posting
your findings.  I mean what is the use of being warm if you are dead?!?!  &lt;

&gt;&gt;  Here is a link to the heaters that were discussed earlier in the week.
I just ordered one and will hope that it gets here by the end of the month
for our campout.  &lt;&lt;
