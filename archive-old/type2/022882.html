&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Wasn't there a cool option on Rivera's for an awning that was housed
&gt; &gt; under the pop-top affixed to the inside of the fiber-glass  -  when 
&gt; the top
&gt; &gt; is up it rolled out from underneath the pop-top over the top of the 
&gt; rain
&gt; &gt; gutter, then attached to poles and guy-wires?  I've heard about 
&gt; them but
&gt; &gt; never seen them.  Maybe there's an aftermarket product that could 
&gt; be rigged
&gt; &gt; to do the same?  &lt;&lt;
==============================&gt;
I saw one of these last year in Colorado at a camp site.
I had meant to fab one up, and forgot all about it.
Thanks for reminding me.
I think I know how to replicate their design pretty easily.
