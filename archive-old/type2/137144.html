Subject: Re: [T2] Bus runs, well kinda

Hello Jules,
    If I were you, I would definitely find an oil-bath air cleaner. I 
ran my '70 bus for years with the made in Taiwan paper media filters, 
and when I finally installed the oil bath air filter, all was really 
grand. It ran light years better and the oil in the crank case stayed 
much cleaner longer. Those oil bath filters are very, very efficient. VW 
knew what they were doing.
    Also--do you have a fire extinguisher? If I were you, I'd stop 
everything and do nothing until you have that extinguisher. I carried 
one with me for nine years, and this last summer I finally spilled some 
gas on the engine and it started a fire when we restarted. And of 
course, a few weeks previously I had removed the extinguisher. It was 
really ugly not having that extinguisher, and could have saved a whole 
lot of money and heartache.

Thanks,
John Tracy

BACK.

&gt;Finally, any tips on an aftermarket air filter to fit the 34PICT3? I
&gt;don't have the oilbath aircleaner. Also,  does a '71 have a facility
&gt;for preheated intake air?
