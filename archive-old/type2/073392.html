thanks for all the responses. i got lots of good tips on how to approach
this, and i know what to ask now as far as the what, where and why of
engine replacements when i'm looking at these buses.

i'm getting a bit antsy. can't wait to get a bus! I do have one more
question, though. hopefully this one won't start a religious war or
anything.

i've found what looks to be a very promising 1971 westy. I've been thinking
of getting a 76-78, simply because the engines are bigger and because of
fuel injection. is there any reason i wouldn't want a '71? it seems like in
some ways it might be simpler for me to work on than a later model. Muir et
al rants constantly about all the hoses in the late model vw's, and one of
the reasons i got rid of my jetta was so that i could have a much simpler
car to work on. so, what are the advantages/disadvantages of the early 70's
westy's as opposed to the late 70's? I don't intend to do my own rebuilds
or anything because i live in an apartment int he city, but as far as
general maintenance that can be done in an afternoon in a driveway, is one
better than the other?

By the way, if anyone is interested, i have a friend selling her black '68
transporter in arizona. she says it need brake work and sliding door work.
email me if you want her contact info.

thanks again,
-perry
