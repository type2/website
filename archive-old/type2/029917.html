For the price of a tie rod, I'd replace it.  You might pull it off and
&quot;exercise&quot; the joints to move the grease around which might fix the
problem for a while.

&gt; Well, I greased the heck out of the zerks (they were very dry - I assumed
&gt; Lube &amp; Fly would have found these - yup ASSUMED), and that didn't fix the
&gt; squeak.
&gt; 
&gt; I used the old &quot;screwdriver as a stethoscope&quot; trick and found the noise was
&gt; coming from my driver's side tie-rod. The tie-rod isn't loose, and it's
&gt; about 18 months old.
&gt; 
&gt; My question: Does it need replacing (and ergo, realignment), or can I just
&gt; pull the ends upside down and WD40 each?
