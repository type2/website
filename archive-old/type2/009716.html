Greetings!

I am new to the list.

I have several promising leads on my quest for a Type 181.

My question (seeking the collective wisdom of the list): What would be a 
“normal” compression test result for a 1600 cc engine? What is the  “danger 
zone” were a rebuild is imminent?

I have found a local VW with approximately 100k original mile on it’s engine 
w/o a rebuild; also one vicinity NYC w/ 70k…. What should I expect?

I apologize for the use of bandwidth on such a rudimentary question!  My 
“Idiots Manual” departed with my last VW – a 70 Bus in 1996.

Thanks in Advance!
Mike
Fayetteville, NC
