Subject: sunroof

I have a '77 sunroof I have had for years, I love it, my roof leaks (even
with new seal) but works flawlessly.
I would say that they are about as rare as a champagne edition. So not
really, but dwindling in numbers rapidly. Parts are expensive for them, very
expensive.

As far as the stuck roof, I would take all the hardware off the sunroof from
inside and then trying to refit it, the hardware comes off pretty easy, and
then it gives you a chance to lube the guides and gears....I highly advise
lubrication, may save you coin in the long-run.
