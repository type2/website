Howard--That Fridolin you saw at The Classic was &quot;Freddy&quot;  our Swiss
Postal that i had shipped to the States.  Talk about RUST!! the windows
were rusted  half open! sheet metal had to be fabricated from the
belt-line down and from the back of the door to the back of the other
sliding door.--Took almost a year to restore--but Freddy was truly a one
of a kind--My first drive in it was interesting as i looked down i could
see the road passing from under my feet!! Freddy was featured in VW
Trends--thanks--TWWM, uj
