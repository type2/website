Could be a bad alternator (rectifier?) diode. I had this problem; it
eventually led to the alt. failing. The diodes can be replaced if you're
very handy with a soldering iron - I seem to recall the main thing is to
sink the heat away from the diode itself to avoid damaging it.

My engine is rebuilt. It has an alternator, not a generator. The red 
light stays on at idle (the engine is generally idling a little slow, but 
better than it was), and then appears to go off during normal driving. 
However, when driving in the dark, I've noticed that the light actually 
doesn't go off completely--it sort of glows softly. It just isn't bright 
enough to notice during the day.
