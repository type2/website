&gt; Subject: Trip Report: The Estes Park Day Trip That Wasn't

&gt; Bus was ready at 11am this morning. $82 in labor. No parts. I hauled butt
  home after that because I didn't want to stop anywhere and take a chance
  something else would happen. Sigh. Wife swears she's not going on another
  roadtrip in the bus again. Ever. Ever.

  A few more pics taken at various places during the trip here:
