Subject: Re: [T2] Fuse box wires... '78 Westy

I just found that Richard Atwell has some info on the radio wiring.

9.27 Wiring in a * radio*:

The VW *radio* is wired to the accessory *fuse* and won't come on unless you
turn the key to the accessory position. Unfortunately this also powers up
the coil which shouldn't be left on for long periods of time with the engine
off. The same problem exists when you add an aftermarket *radio*.

Most baywindows have a warning buzzer that goes off when you open the door
and leave the key in the ignition. If you or the PO threw the buzzer away
because it made an annoying sound you may have forgotten about this.

Because the circuit (SU terminal on ignition switch) is hot when you put in
the key this becomes a great way to power the *radio* without worrying about
the coil.

Install an automotive relay between the door contact switch and ground. Use
the other relay terminals to power your relay from the fusebox and be sure
to *fuse* the lead to the *radio*.


All this is good except for the last sentence where Richard talks about
installing relays between the door contact switch and ground.  I thought
RAtwell was telling me to piggy back onto the SU terminal on the ignition
switch, but I guess not.

My #9 16Amp is always 12.34V hot, ALWAYS HOT.  My other 16Amp fuse is #12.
My fuse box doesn't seem to follow any recognized  convention, so I guess
all bets are off.......
