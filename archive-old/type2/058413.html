Subject: 1976 for sale near Chattanooga, TN

Hi,
     I have a '76 Westy for sale.  It has new canvas (not installed very
well, but NEW), complete
interior except for the table for the front seats.  Engine run and idles
well, but the bus is not driveable.  It needs a new clutch for sure, and
new fuel lines.  The body is in ok shape.  It has some primer areas, and
some minor damage.  I was planning to restore this bus and use it as our
camper, but I think that I want to find a splittie or one that I don't
have to do any (or much) work to.  I am asking $1600.00 for the bus, and
I also have brand new (un-installed) window and door rubber for the
entire bus (front window, front door rubber seals, slider door seal,
jalousy window seals, rear driver side window seal with seal for the
vent widow, rear hatch seal and rear hatch window seal, engine
compartment seal, passenger side rear window).  I will include the
rubber for an additional $400.00.
     If you are interested, the bus is located in LaFayette, GA, about
20 miles south of Chattanooga, TN
