OK Stiff engine, eh?...
Did you, perchance, use a connecting rod from an engine that had dropped a 
valve?
A twisted rod will behave this way...
I had a dear friend (I was dating his daughter at the time) who had grabbed a 
short block to drop in the daughters car..a fastback, it were....It got to 
the point where the starter would not turn the engine over..Luke was a 
plumber, not a mechanic...out came the 5 HP pipe threading machine and a hole 
drilled through the back of the car, a socket welded to a pipe, with the pipe 
locked in the machine and the socket on the crank 
pulley.....................Yes, it started...once........
It was later found the short block was from a car that had swallowed a 
valve...the rod was twisted about 4 degrees....the piston has to move in 
plane just a *wee* bit different from that of the cylinder....it binds and 
scuffs and distorts.....
I could be bearings and all that...but the clue is that it started when you 
got &quot;above&quot; the crankcase...
I've also seen the clip left off the crank gear and the timing gears work 
toward the pulley and *really* screw things up..maybe this explains your 
timing problem??????
My college engine professor, Oscar Tinettti, said it best..&quot;Engines don''t 
wear *in* they wear *out*!&quot;.... Once you reach a point where it stops turning 
freely..stop..it ain't gunna get better!
It's gotta come out and get checked...sorry...
