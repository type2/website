Subject: Re: [T2] Wheel color

&gt; 73 Westy...  
&gt; are stock rims painted? what color or were there
&gt; different colors?

&gt;&gt;The wheels of the 1971 until 1979 models are 'chrome
&gt;&gt;color L91' according to the data in the
partscatalog.
 
I have in my hand a spray can labeled:  L0091.03,
Silver Argent, Part# LVW2932444 it's VW NOS and was
available several years ago, not sure now.
