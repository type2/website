     Well, I don't really have an office.  I now work as a Hi way Flagger, 
since getting crushed by a truck, I miss auto body, but there are advantages 
to working all over the place. I've worked major hi ways to small country 
roads.  I guess you could say the scenery of Oregon is my office.  I work 
where there's work.  I use my '74 Thing in the summer months, gotta love road 
construction!  In the colder weather I use my '69 Riviera camper.  My fellow 
and fellowet coworkers all drive American iron, cept one gal with a Toyota.  
I never know when I'm gonna get a break during the day, I once stood in the 
same area for 9 straight hours.  So when break time   does come, I like to 
kick back.  This includes naps, fresh coffee, a free place to stay on those 
over nighters, and if I can get to it a bath room.  I'd say I'm about the 
most comfortable Flaggers where I work.  Another great thing is I don't have 
to load and unload my gear.  I can drive home, pick up my family, and go 
somewhere without removing a thing!  Now that's versatility!!
                                                                          
Peace,
                                                                              
FW.Tyler
                                                                              
Happy owner of 12 VWs
