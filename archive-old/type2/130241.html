IIRC, the code on the engine case isn't really diagnostic for anything 
but the case. Any Type 4 case can be rebuilt to any of the three 
possible displacements. What matters is what the heads are. Wilson 
lists the letter codes for heads.

The clearest diagnostic is the shape of the piston. 2000s have innies, 
and 1700 &amp; 1800s have outies.

In a way, Seann's question contains its own answer. If you are 
rebuilding the engine in your bus (or buying one that's been rebuilt) 
you have two and half reasonable choices. One is to get the correct 
displacement for the year of your bus -- i.e.: stock. The other is to 
rebuild to a 2000 no matter what you have. The cases don't vary 
appreciably. The extra half a choice is whether to build with solid 
lifters and cam, or hydraulics.
