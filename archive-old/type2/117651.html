&gt; My son bought a 74 Bus off of e-bay.  He has been driving it for about a week.  Apart from some backfiring when it first starts up and cosmetics, its appears to be in good running order.  It came with new carbs, new tires and a year old battery.
&gt; 
&gt; Immediate needs to buy or schnore are a passenger side rear view mirror, a rim for the spare tire, and an antenna.
&gt; 
&gt; He says he is going to restore it, which will be cool if he does.  I was 
&gt; wondering what you guys would recommend as the top ten list of things to 
&gt; check out and make sure are in working order for an old bus like this.   

- check the transmission fluid and/or replace it.

- gas lines (as mentioned)

- brakes -- check/replace pads/shoes to prevent having to spend more money 
		on drums and rotors later

- flush brake lines with new fluid

- grease front beam with grease gun

- spray hose at front of bus and check if water leaks inside 
	bus.  if so, consider replacing windshield seal (or 2 years later
	you'll find it rusted out - ask me how I know)

- oil and filter change

- adjust valves

- compression test (all plugs out, valves adj., and car warmed up)

- inspect, check, re-gap, (and/or replace) plugs while they're out

There's 10, although I'm sure there are more...
