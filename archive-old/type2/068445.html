Subject: 12 v space heater

     Ok, so now we know where to obtain a 12v blanket but does anyone know 
     about 12v space heaters?  We'd sure like one until we can afford to 
     buy new heater boxes.  We always manage to stay toasty under the 
     quilts and sleeping bag in the bus but getting up in the middle of the 
     night to go use a tree is frighteningly chilly.  A warm interior would 
     be great.
