Here's the set-up:
New 1600 longblock from VW of Mexico.
New heater boxes from Bus Depot.
New stock exhaust from Bus Depot.
New Solex H30/31 PICT carb.
Oil-bath air cleaner.
New intake manifold.
Mechanical advance distributor.
Petronix Ignitor ignition.
New Blue coil
New generator.
Rebuilt stock fuel pump.
Engine tin stripped and freshly painted.
New Yokohama 356's with 32 PSI.
New plastic hoses from shroud to heater boxes. (Gene Berg)
New dipstick temp. sensor. (Gene Berg)
91 octane fuel.
At 350 miles I changed the oil (20W 50), adjusted the valves, adjusted the
idle with tach/dwell meter to 900 RPM. Timed engine to 0 gerees TDC. Tuned
the carb per Barb and Eric.
My problem is that when I get on the highway for 15 minutes or more, my oil
light comes on telling me I have reached 220 degrees.
The light will go off if I get off the highway and drive in stop and go
traffic under 45 MPH. I have exhausted everything I can think of, checked
and rechecked, and I am still running hot, even though it's a cool 74
degrees outside.
What is a good operating temperature for a 1600? I'm not for sure, but I
figure I am probably hitting 225 to 230 degrees. 230 is the temperature
where all sorts of bad things are supposed to start happening (per Gene
Berg).
Am I missing anything here? If I don't figure this thing out soon, I'm
dropped it off at the local VW mechanic. I would just really like to figure
this out, and fix it myself. any ideas?
Thanks,
Jeff Buckmaster
