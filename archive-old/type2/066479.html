Subject: Coil Testing

How does one test a coil that only appears to fail intermittently?
If one can catch it when it fails, no spark, easy.  But when the bus 
is running and coil is appearing to do it's thang, how do you tell 
that the coil is faulty. Now that I have replaced the coil on general 
principles, how can I be sure that IT is the failure point, not 
something else waiting for that opportunity to ambush.  I don't have 
a fancy ohm meter (yet) to be able to test resistance per Bentley.
And would that show faulty part when it's still working?
