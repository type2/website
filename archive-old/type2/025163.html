I looked all over for those arrows and couldn't find them...I'm using Wilson's book and he referenced the arrows. Spent 10 minutes or more looking for the arrows, but there's a little corrosion on the outer edges, where I think the arrows are supposed to be.

I know which side goes up. The mount attaches to the engine in the valley of the curved center part; the outer parts are higher. I think the passenger side has a crook/curve in it and the driver's side is relatively straight; but that's the part I'm fuzzy on.

Thanks! Joe
