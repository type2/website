Subject: Re: [T2] retractable seat belts

Louis Allard sends:

&gt; You're absolutely right, and I'm pretty sure I read somewhere that
&gt; seatbelts have a &quot;lifespan&quot; related to the stretching caracteristics of
&gt; their material...   I think it's something like 15-20 years....  As you
&gt; mentionned a seatbelt stretches when an accident occurs, and that
&gt; stretching helps to &quot;pad&quot; the shock of the impact.

Sunlight does 'em in too. And the stuff you spill on them, rough stuff you
might drag them across, the sand on your swimsuit after a day at the
beach...

Old paranoid Jim again: I wouldn't install used seatbelts any more than I'd
drive on used tires, sleep on a used mattress or eat used food. You're never
sure just what those things have been through. I figure that if Dale
Earnhardt could manage to break a new seat belt that's of far higher
strength than the ones we use in our Buses (5,000psi tensile strength
minimum), I'm not chancing it with a used one.
