Subject: Wannabus: '71 or earlier or, what have you?

My college-student nephew came to visit us at Transporters By The Tunnel 
last weekend, and he is hooked. He is looking for something he can drive 
and maintain, but not a major project. 

He missed the $1500 '71 Westie in Conn. last weekend; that would
have been ideal, though at the upper end of his budget. A camper is 
nice, but not at all necessary. 

He is reading his Idiot book right now, and is willing to do some 
travel, since he cannot find  many buses in his Albany, NY stomping 
grounds. Write Nic direct at forhan_at_siena_dot_edu

Thanks,

Tom F.
