&gt;My beloved VeeDub is consistently measuring a high CO% at 2500 rpm.  At
&gt;idle, the CO% is only 2.05, but it increases as the rpm increases.  Is
&gt;this normal?  I was told by my VW mechanic that it should actually go
&gt;down as the engine speed increases.  Is this true?  Could this be an
&gt;indication of clogged and old fuel injectors?  Any info would be greatly
&gt;appreciated.

You've got a rich mixture problem.  Did you replace the temp sensor # 2
when you rebuilt your engine.  That would be my first guess but it could be
other things.  If you have an ohm meter, you can test it easy.

These tests are a compilation of resistance tests from the four or five
manuals I found during my recent &quot;rich &quot;running problem.

1. Take the harness off the ECU

2. Look in the list library (EFI-Samick, I think) for a description of the
numbering on the pins.

3. put ohm meter contact between #13 and #17 ground.  This tests the
Temperature sensor II.  At 68 degrees it should be between 2000-2900 ohms.
(700-1000 _at_122 degrees; 200-400 _at_ 176 degrees; and less than 200 at
operating temp.)  Testing this at the plug test whether there is a problem
in the harness too.

4.  Test between #6 and # 27 to check the Air temp sensor in the AFM.  It
should be between 2100-2900 _at_ 68 degrees.

Note: if you find a problem,  check the readings at the device.  This will
tell whether its the harness or the devise.

5. Test the following AFM circuits:

            6 &amp; 7      40-300 ohms

            6 &amp; 8      130-260 ohms

            6 &amp; 9      200-400 ohms     (100-300 ohms)

            7 &amp; 8      100-500 ohms     (80-200 ohms)

            8 &amp; 9      70-140 ohms

The readings to the (side) are from bentley for 76 up models but I found
that the Bentley figures didn't jive with the other manuals and were to
restrictive.  (You'll be throwing away good part if you use Bentley)


Also check the cold start for leaks or the  thermo time switch for not
shutting off the cold start after warm up.

There are others but try these  first as these are the crucial ones.  If
this doesn't fix it get back to me and I tell you how to hook up a O 2
sensor so you can re set your AFM.

LET ME  KNOW?

Have fun
