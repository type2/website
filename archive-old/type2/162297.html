Subject: Re: [T2] brake lights or lack

Karl,

Lordy, I just love the way that you get directly to the point!!!!

&quot;&gt; Buy 2 new switches. Remove the 2 old ones and admire the crap in the 
holes!&quot;

What would we do without you!!!


Cheers, dave

&gt;  very quickly, me not you,  i noticed tonight that my brake lights only come
&gt; on when the pedal is almost fully depressed.  this might help explain some
&gt; dirty looks and tailgaiters.  is this normal?  if not any quick easy fixes?

&gt; 
&gt; 3) if you do not flush your brake system every 2 years [like everyone should but never does!!!] then crap in
&gt; the fluid settles into the bottom of the master. This plugs the holes in the switches.

&gt; Flush the master and the reservoirs with clean brake fluid. Install the 2 new switches. Bleed all 4 wheels
&gt; until clean fluid appears.
