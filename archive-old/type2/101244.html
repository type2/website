Subject: Carburetor Weirdness

Hiya Fellow Listees,

Had something a little strange happen to my Solex 30/31.  

Started the beast up this morning.  Let 'er warm up.  Then I proceeded down 
the block on my way to work.  Everything seemed fine until I stopped at the 
intersection.  After that I had no power whatsoever.  Just barely managed to 
get out into the intersection and it died.  Got it over to the side of the 
road.  Funny thing is that it idled just fine - but no go in gear. 

Looked it over and found that the dime sized &quot;plug&quot; (for lack of a better 
term) in the carb body (just a few millimeters up from the base and facing to 
the rear) had popped out.  Well, this was an easy fix (the plug was laying on 
the cooling tin and I had some electrical tape) and I got home just fine.

But (Question Number One), what caused this?  Crummy carb construction or 
what?  Doesn't seem that there should be an inordinate amount of internal 
pressure at that spot.  And (Question Number Two) what's the generally 
accepted method of making a permanent fix here?

Mike
