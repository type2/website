With &quot;normal&quot; watercooled engines the usual changeover mileage is 5-10K
miles.  With the harder-working type 1 it is probably possible to cut this
number somewhat.  I'd say that 3K is probably plenty to have everything
seated well.

I can't resist pointing out that 20W50 is probably a bit too thick for a
new tight engine.  Since oil flow through the cooler is regulated by oil
viscosity, the higher viscosity oil will not flow through the cooler as
readily as 10W30 or 10W40.  Something to consider!
