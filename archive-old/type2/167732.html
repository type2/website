&gt; It currently has (as far as I can tell using ratwell_dot_com) solid

&gt; I guess also, is it recommended to even run hydraulic lifters/rods (if
&gt; adjusted properly over  time).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; i am not the expert so I am interested in what others say and have read many
&gt; of the previous arguments,   but in deffense    I drive a 78  all stock with
&gt; almost 180,000 original miles and my Hydraulic lifters are performing well!!!

there were only two things I hated doing on my VW's and that was
adjusting points and adjusting valves, the hyd lifters took care of
one and the Crane ignition took care of the other

Boston (Bob) Engine offers a Hyd lifter upgrade on engine rebuilds.
