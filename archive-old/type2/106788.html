 the number if your bearing has it or measure and x-referance. they found
for
 me the one year only seal for my tranny that everyone told me was nla in
 their stock

&gt; &gt; bearings are pretty standard and are the same as the wheel bearings in
&gt; other
&gt; &gt; trailers.  I found a set at NAPA autoparts.  &gt; &gt;
