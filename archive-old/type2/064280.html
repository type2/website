&gt;&gt; Can any CB-ers out there advise me on the relative merits
&gt;&gt; of different CBs?
&gt;&gt; I just want 2 cheap second hand ones for occasional use
&gt;&gt; in our 2 buses. Is there anything I should know? (I know
&gt;&gt; nothing).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Actually, I'd be interested in this as well. Having a CB would have made
&gt;multi-bus traveling a lot more pleasant, so I'm planning on getting one one
&gt;day.

        I don't know much, but I can say with athority that the hand-held
variety are a real pain in the butt. That's what I used for the Inuvik run,
and it worked, but not too well. Reception and transmission problems went
with me all the way to Eagle Plains. Even Bob Hoover had a hard time
picking me up, with his signal amps and that monster antenna he had. And he
talked to someone in Idaho up near Inuvik. From Eagle Plains north Don Kane
let me use his CB, and it was a MAJOR improvement over the hand held. The
main advantage of a hand held is the portablilty-you can go walk around
with it-but the range and battery life are so short it's pretty pointless.
Just my $.02.

Peace,
