Subject: VW Trends follies

Sometimes you gotta wonder if they carefully read their own publication. In the 
nuts&amp; bolts column in  last month's issue, the owner of a 77 bus wrote in 
asking if fully synthetic oil was right for his bus(he had been using synth 
blend). He was concerned about compatability with seals. The answer didn't 
address the issue of seal compatability at all, but suggested that synth oil 
was not a good thing for an ACVW.
I quote; &quot;Synthetic engine oil was designed for watercooled engines which, of 
course, use water to cool the engine. Aircooled VW's otoh, use air and oil to 
cool the engine.Synthetic oil, by nature resists heat in an effort to prevent 
thermal breakdown of the oil. Engine oil in an aircooled VW acts as both a 
lubricant and a coolant. When synthetic oil is used in an aircooled VW, the oil 
resists heat heat generated by the engine, resulting in an increase of the 
cylinder head temp...&quot; 
The real kicker is that the latest issue has the following blurb on the 
cover &quot;Why in Synthetic oil overlooked?&quot;. The article inside extolls the 
virtues of synth oil and attempts to dispel some of the myths.
This means that a) no one person reads all the content for each month's issues 
and one hand knows not what the other does, b)VWT's tech editor knows not what 
the he** he speaks of, C)they really do believe that synth oil is bad, and they 
want readers to ruin their engines and buy new ones from their advertisers.
Just some food for thought on friday, feel free to pick apart their reasoning
(or mine if necesary).
Happy Friday
mike
