Subject: Repairing Rust on a Bus
Message-ID: &lt;19991027025541.12242.rocketmail_at_web601.yahoomail_dot_com&gt;

I’m looking for a westy camper van and have seen a ’76
model locally for sale. The bus looks generally well
kept - has 130K on the clock on the original engine &amp;
transmission. The interior is in good condition and
the bus drives well.
But… there is rather more rust on the lower part of
the bus than I’d really like. Specifically, 
1)  the rocker panel under the sliding door has holes.

2)  The lower panel in front of the real wheel arch
have holes in
3)   The Front wheel arches have rust holes in at the
top rear and the bottom front. 
4)  Finally, looking into the front wheel arches there
is serious rust along a horizontal section that runs
the whole width of the wheel arch from the outer rim
to about 2 foot into the bus. It seems to run along a
steel sectional piece that is open to the side of the
bus. This piece looks like a support section for the
bus frame.


My question is how serious are these rust areas and
how difficult to fix. I’d plan on keeping the bus for
a while so would want to make a good repair i.e. no
bondo &amp; chicken wire!  It’s the item No. 4 above that
I see as most serious but not really being familiar
with the Bus and its structure &amp; weak spots, I’m
really looking for any comments..

Thanks.. Steve
