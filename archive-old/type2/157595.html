&gt; I was shopping over the weekend and came across a specialty store
selling Garmin GPS devices. They've come a long way since I last looked
at them a few years ago finally offering pleasant color touch screens.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone have any experience with them to share?

I have no experience with the new ones, but my experience with a GPS II+
and a GPS III+ has taught me that Garmin makes a darned good product.
When it comes time to upgrade I'll buy another Garmin.
