Subject: RE: [T2] Need outdoor cover for camper

&gt; a Question, our city has been ticketing any untagged visible 
&gt; vehicle (even if on private property) and will tow it after 
&gt; so many days,  if covered with something like this the TAGS 
&gt; MUST BE VISIBLE!! I have seen these covers now with clear 
&gt; plastic at the location of the vehicles tags. just wondering 
&gt; if this cover would be like that or would you have to cut a 
&gt; hole for the tag to show thru????


What an inconvenient city ordinance! Yes, you'd have to make a hole. But
why not just tie or bracket the license plate so that it sits very low
when in storage (between the bottom of the cover and the ground), or
even tape or tie it to the outside of the cover? If you cover your bus
after each use it would be inconvenient to relocate the tag each time.
But if you cover it for the season, this might be an option.
