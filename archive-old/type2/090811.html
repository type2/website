Subject: Re: [T2] Sliding Door Fix

I always buy my body panels from busdepot_dot_com  They seem to have pretty
much anything at good prices (ALWAYS beats Rocky Mountain Motor.  I'm
sure they have the complete track assembly for your bus (they do for
mine), as well as rocker panels.  Order their printed catalog if your
into paper!  As far as welding is concerned, I'm pretty much ignorant
there (no comment, please).

Hope this helped, 
Kyle
