&gt; Hello,
&gt;I am curretly working down my job list to get poor old Isolde through
&gt; her MOT.  I failed on play in the steering (among other things) so I
got
&gt; yself a new pin kit, including the phosphor bronze bushes, and I am
all
&gt; ready to fit it.  However, I have now tried lots of things and I
can't get
&gt; the two old bushes out.  I've tried eat ad brute force (not that I
am much
&gt; of a brute) and I still can't get it. If anyone knows the knack, I
would be
&gt; most grateful if they could enlighten me.

You need a thick washer just a bit smaller than the OD of the
bushings, another washer with a somewhat larger OD, a piece of tubing
with ID larger than the bushing OD about 3 inches long, a piece of 3/8
all-thread about 10 inches long, and two 3/8 nuts.  (feel free to use
metric hardware of similar sizes).

With the pivot pin out, put the smaller washer on top of the top
bushing, then push the all-thread up through the bushings and the hole
in the washer, then screw on one of the nuts, leaving the all-thread
dangling through the bushings.

Now put the tubing over the all thread, followed by the larger washer,
then the second nut.

Now you can tighten the nut, causing the all-thread to pull the
smaller washer through the axle beam, pushing the bushings in front of
it.  They will be pulled into the tubing after which your entire tool
will drop free of the beam.

You can use the washers and all-thread to push the new bushings into
place as well.
