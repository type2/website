Subject: Here's why you would want a second bus

We cannot all do what Charlie Ford was wise enough to do: take a year off 
and search for the beginning of the wind.

A great second choice, though, is to have a camper that you can use for a 
weekend or a week, driving and camping from A to B, then park (at an RV 
storage place) at B and fly, train, or take the Greyhound home. Next 
chance you get, go retrieve your bus and drive from B to C. And so on. 
Less wear on the bus, and time is less of a factor.
