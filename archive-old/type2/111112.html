Subject: RE: [T2] Mexico VWs?

&gt; Of course, the border guards have NEVER seen a Mexico VW, nor a USA VW, and
&gt; they would not be able to tell the difference, and they probably don't know

Now why would you assume that folks who work day in and day out at the
border between Mexico and the U.S. would have never seen a VW of any sort?

&gt; bus.  You don't NEED the black grill up front, what ever that's for...

You mean that big grill that covers up the big ol' watercooled RADIATOR?
Naw, just cover that with sheetmetal and paint it to match the bus....
