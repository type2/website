&gt; Ugh, my '78 Westy has apparently dropped a valve seat. Time for yet
&gt; another top end rebuild. This makes about 6 in 10 years. Only about 20K
&gt; miles since the last one (that was a burned ring). I even found
&gt; myself thinking the unthinkable, albeit briefly: sell the bus?

NO, BOB!!! Don't do it!!!  However, I think you may have a problem.
Valve seats are the most common failure point on type4 motors, but that is
not usually due to defects in the seats, heads, or valves.  Valve failure
is what I call a consequent failure.  They fail, but are not themselves
the problem, and in that they are like a fuse.  Valves fail because the
head gets too hot and differential expansion between the seat and head
allow the seat to come loose. Losing valves in 6 heads in 10 years says
that you are overheating motors on a regular basis.  I don't know why, but
I think that is the problem, not the heads themselves.

When you next replace your heads, I would urge you to install both an oil
temperature and cylinder head temperature gauge on your engine (an oil
pressure gauge would be nice as well :).  If you find that one of the
gauges is peaking above acceptable levels, then you can act to correct
whatever the *real* problem is.  During your top-end rebuilds, have you
replaced your oil cooler? Cleaned it off (look on top of the cooler core
for a couple leaves and accumulated munge)? Checked the thermostat/flap
operation?

&gt; But I can view this as an opportunity. My 2.0L engine came to me with 1800
&gt; heads and I've rebuilt it with 1800 heads several times. They used to be a
&gt; lot more available and affordable than 2.0L heads and they can be swapped
&gt; without modification to anything else. But now I find that The Bus Depot
&gt; has a source of heads that makes them all cost the same, so now maybe it's
&gt; time for me to get back to 2.0L heads on a 2.0L engine as God and the VW
&gt; engineers intended. My bus has not seen that since it's youth before me.

As Tom Young said, there is no difference between the 1.8 and 2.0 heads
except valve size. The smaller late valves may actually help you by
limiting flow and thus HP.  Less HP = less heat.

&gt; If power is directly proportional to displacement, then I might expect to
&gt; see a 10% increase in performance. Will I really? That would be cool.

No.  P&amp;Cs and rods set displacement, Head volume and deck height set
CR.  You will not be changing your displacement at all.

&gt; Anyone out there care to comment on the quality of The Bus Depot's heads
&gt; and their claim that the remanufature process they use is &quot;better than
&gt; original&quot; and somehow reduces dropped valve problems?

These days every rebuilder is staking the seats in, so they are all
&quot;better than original&quot; in that respect.  Many are also operating on
increased interference on the head/seat fit to increase tolerance for
overheating. The risk with the increased interference is that it puts more
strain on the head.  I would expect to see more cracks in these heads.

One word of warning is that John Anderson has a long rant on German vs.
Spanish heads since they have different alloys in their composition.
Since John is the actual engineer here, I would invite him to comment on
that.  I don't know which cores Ron's rebuilder is using (or if they are
even watching)
