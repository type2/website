I'm not an expert on the original Westy tents, but I know as much as anyone 
about the new offerings from Germany.

The new tents are lighter and easier to setup.  They give you more room since 
the frame is now on the inside, and more options with sides that roll up or 
make into awnings.

The new tents don't have floors, as the Europeans prefer them this way.  They 
are used as a side room or foyer and not meant for sleeping, unless you get 
the optional sleep cabin.

Side tents are great during rainy or cold weather, and make camping more 
enjoyable as you have added space and more room to move around with privacy.  
I wouldn't consider camping without at least or awning, as a little rain can 
keep you cramped inside your bus, and the awning or tent gives you room to 
move around.

Side tents are also great when camping in a hard top bus.  You have room to 
stand up, prepare meals and change clothes.

There are also several new bus tents that are round and use fiberglass poles. 
 I have the Tourmobil tents in stock, and they are amazing in how small they 
pack, and how light they are.
