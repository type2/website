&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I currently have 2 seperate keys for my 1971 Westy.  One for the ignition,
&gt; the other for the door locks.  I would like to get a lock for the engine
&gt; hatch.  Instead of having 3 seperate keys, is there an inexpensive and easy
&gt; way to have all the locks (including the engine hatch lock) re-keyed to work
&gt; with a single key?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.

A good locksmith should be able to handle it; maybe also a dealer with
all the old-time kits and tools. (Many have thrown them away.)
