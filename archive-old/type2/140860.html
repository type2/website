Subject: Re: [T2] Need help with transmission

From SteelersBus:

While sitting in nuetral, when I release the clutch pedal, it makes a very
noticeable whirling sound from the tranny. If I depress the clutch, it stops.
Let out clutch, it starts to &quot;whirl&quot; again.
I just replaced the cluth kit. Installed engine back in and it still makes the
sound.
I was wondering if you think the one of the following may be the problem.

 1. Mainshaft bearing is bad, making the sound??

 2. The TRANSMISSION DIFFERENTIAL BEARING is bad, making the sound??

 OR, none of the above??

 If it is possibly one of these, how hard are they to replace?? Any special
tools needed?

 Thanks for any help.

None of the above IF you have the correct freeplay in your clutch pedal.

In neutral, with the clutch disengaged and the vehicle sitting still; the ONLY thing turning on a bearing is
the input shaft bearing.

The mainshaft is NOT moving.

Nothing in the differential is moving.

The crankshaft and the input shaft are locked via the clutch disc.

The pilot bearing is one with the crankshaft and input shaft.

The throwout bearing is not turning because it is away from the fingers.

Step on the clutch and no noise: this eliminates the throw out bearing and the pilot bearing. They are now in
action and you have no noise.

But the input shaft stops turning and the noise stops. Because the input shaft bearing is the culprit.

#2 here is the input shaft: http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/Microfiche/t203000.gif
the bearing rides at the point where the line goes up from the #2.
The bearing is  #7. It sits in the bellhousing where the #20 bolts hold the sleeve on here:
