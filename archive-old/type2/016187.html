&gt;The mechanic and I would both like to know what effect *not* having a
&gt;catalytic on this exhaust system would have?  Specifically, what impact on
&gt;the FI system?  I am plainly ignorant when it comes to the whole FI
process,
&gt;despite having read the archives.  And should my exhaust (one of those
&gt;four-tip empi-style jobbies) have an output for a cat, or has it been
&gt;misidentified?  Can I save the 100 bucks (Ron's cat price), to say nothing
&gt;of the INFAMOUSLY obscure cross-pipe thingy?

Justin,

What is the effect of &quot;not&quot; having a catalytic converter have on the FI
system (federal without O2 sensor)?  The short answer is none....the long
answer is none, nada, zilch, zip, zero, no problemo.  Even with the O2
sensor in the California model FI system I don't think the lack of catalytic
converter would make a difference.  That is assuming everything else in the
FI system is working properly.  Catalytic converters simply force you to
keep your emissions in check or they will melt down, clog the exaust system,
and choke the engine until it dies.  The inside of a new cat looks like a
honey comb and the inside of one that has been exposed to high emissions (ie
burned out) looks like a very large wad of black bubble gum that clogs the
exaust and shuts down the engine.  A local mechanic, who is a very technical
and anal rententive, says the loss of back pressure in the exaust from
removing the cat may cause you to burn a valve, but even he admits that is a
very low probability.  Install the empi-style four-tip and skip the cat.
After everything is back in place and you have driven a couple thousand
miles, broken everything in, fine tuned the valves, and fine tuned the
timing then you should take your bus to a reputable shop and have them check
and adjust your FI (via big screw on top of AFM) to the proper specs.  Most
modern shops are equipped with the exaust analyzers needed to do this.  I
paid $30 at a local shop to have this done.  It is probably the finest piece
of fine tuning you can do to your FI system and most simply skip this step.
I can't tell any difference in performance, but I get a warm fuzzy feeling
knowing I'm keeping air pollution down and it only cost me $30.      

Randall and Kermit
