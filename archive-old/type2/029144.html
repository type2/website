&gt;I would like to put the same 3 point seatbelts in the back of our
&gt;camper as we have in the front.

&lt;snip2&gt;
I've got a 1980 Westy that has lap belts for the bench
seat.

Here's a depressing piece of bus news related to your quest for seatbelts.
One of the outcomes will probably be a retrofit kit to add shoulder belts
to at least the 1980 Vanagon if not the bays too. It sounds like they were
available in some countries.
