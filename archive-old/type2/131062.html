Subject: Re: [T2] overheated bad

Air Cooled 74

Belt tight, tin in place, no crud. Seals look good. I was hitting a head
wind but not that strong.
I had driven it earlier in the day (out to the folks house)
and on the way back.. outa the blue.

Im scared to do a compression test when i get back there.
If the oil was hot and bubbling does that mean bad things
to the motor?

James, is this Bus water cooled or air cooled? If air cooled, are the engine
seals all kosher? Has it been a while since the oil was changed? Is there
any crud in the cooling fan or the cooling tins? Is the belt nice and tight?
