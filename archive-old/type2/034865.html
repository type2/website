Subject: Re: 009

The info I have for timing the 1600 with a 009 is as follows.  Someone please 
correct me if this is wrong.

For 30 degrees BTDC:  The timing mark is 43 mm to the right of TDC.  Measure 
the distance and make a mark on the pulley.  Using the static timing light 
with the engine at 3000 rpm adjust the distributor to line up with the seam 
in the case.

For 32 degrees BTDC:  This also equals out to 10 degrees BTDC at idle.  Take 
an open ended 15 mm wrench and lay it on the pulley, with the left side 
opening on TDC and mark the right side of the opening on the pulley.  This 
mark will be _at_ 10 degrees BTDC.  Use this mark to set the timing at idle 
using a standard timing light.
