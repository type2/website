&gt; Ever had the golf tee come out for whatever reason.  Makes a real mess

&gt; you find it and plug it in again. If you are working in your garage, near a
&gt; furnace or hot water heater, your house could go up in flames. This actually
&gt; happened to a neighbor of mine when messing with a dune buggy. Lost his
&gt; whole house (no one was hurt thank GOD). Safety pays...... (and we all know

Hey Tedebare  How ya doing  Well I hope.    Hows the new house?    I had a 
kerosene heater cause a fire in the garage one day when a bus we pushed in had a 
gas line leaking and we didn't know it till too late. As everybody was 
running away I ran back towards the fire a put it out. Could have been real bad but 
as it was it just smooted things up  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
