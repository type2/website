I just wanted to thank everyone for their advice on my earlier e-mail. I 
definetly will stick with the 1600cc engine ( if i can lay my hands on one) 
and the upper bunk thing just a fleeting thought, that now has passed. 

The next issue is if I can put a type 1 1600 in my camper? If so are there 
any considerations here? 

Thanks
Melissa
