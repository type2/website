What bilge blowers are you planning on using?  I was planning on just 
running a duct from the rear/inside of the bus to the stock blower to 
suck out the cold air from the back!  I was thinking about putting some 
blowers in the main duct line, but I don't like the thought of sucking 
air forward with the worry that it will pull fumes in through the 
openings between the muffler and heat exchangers.  I'd rather push so 
much air into the exchangers that some is pushed out.

With the stock blower, it doesn't push that much air so I currently rely 
on the engine to help push air forward.  I like your idea as that should 
probably (hopefully) flow sufficient air up front.  Eventually, if I can 
get enough air flowing through, I'd like to block off the ports inside 
the cooling duct shroud so that I'm no longer sucking air from the 
engine compartment - That drives me nuts to no end.. I don't like the 
smell of a running engine ;)  Plus, you end up with more air flowing 
over the heads, anyways.  I would make tapered plugs, of course, to 
match the contours of the shroud so the air flows smoothly.

  &gt; I've priced everything and I should be able to do it for around $100.
&gt; The only concern is attaching to the right hand stovepipe. It's not
&gt; round, but oval. So I'll need either something flexible or to fab
&gt; something up with sheetmetal. I welcome suggestions here...

I don't think that would be too difficult.  You can buy aluminum ducting 
that comes in various diameters and shouldn't be too tough to form to 
that shape.
