&gt; Don't be scared of the thing!  It's very simple and easy to work on.

This is true.

Word of warning though:

DO NOT TIGHTEN THE SET SCREW EXTRA TIGHT.

It's not that hard to strip if you continually tighten it that last
tweak to make sure it's &quot;extra&quot; tight and won't come loose.

Make sure it's tight and firm, but don't strain it.  You'll more than 
likely
end up buying a new dizzy if you strip it.

cheers,
