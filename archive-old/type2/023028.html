You have to get rid of *all* of the existing rust (sandblast till it's 
gunmetal-grey) and then cover the surface with *many* coats of something 
that will keep the water away from the metal.  I use Corroless from 
Eastwood Restoration (www.eastwoodco_dot_com I think).  I noticed water pooling 
underneath the seal as well, not sure what can be done about it but I don't 
really care anymore since it isn't hurting anything.

&gt;Can anyone here tell me how to prevent RUST from forming under a bay windo

&gt;it? I removed my old glass, cleaned, filled some tiny holes, rust proff
&gt;primed, and painted the area then installed a new seal. It hasn't even rained
&gt;here (just morning DEW) and now I see a rust trail starting under the
&gt;window!!!  When I lifted up the rubber it was all wet underneath. What gives?
&gt;  Besides the obvious clue to never getting it wet can anyone give me a 
&gt; better
&gt;solution? Should I coat the entire surface in silicone? Any help would be
&gt;appreciated.
