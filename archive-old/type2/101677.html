&gt;This might be the stuff you are talking about:

&gt;I posted about it a few months ago.  It has worked well for me in my '72.  I
&gt;covered the areas around the engine and put a couple sheets inside each
&gt;door.  Cheap, easy to work with (especially if you install it on a 100
&gt;degree July day, ask me how I know) and pretty effective at getting rid of
&gt;the tin can sound in your bus.  No stink or problems with adhesive on hot
&gt;days.

Probably very flexible (which is good when applying it) compared to the 
stuff I'm using.

I have done business with Parts Express several times. A+ service. Great 
low prices on things Radio Shack gets considerably higher prices for.
