&lt;weg&gt; You could get to all of them if you had the Secret Decoder Ring. The
ring is $3.95 at JC Whitney, $47.50 at the dealer or $99.95 at Rocky
Mountain Motor Works but oh! what a warranty. 8)

&gt;So, sigh, I assume that the status is as it has been these last many weeks.
&gt; No Hooverisms.  Is there any sign of Bob relenting?

He relented to let me publish a CD-ROM of the Sermons, hopefully including
a raft of new/rediscovered stuff. It will probably be distributed
exclusively by Bus Depot. This should happen around November 1 (which is
when Ron Salmon gets back from a vacation). All this is tentative but I
expect to bring it off on schedule. Stay tuned.
