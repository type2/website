Robert: 
API-GL-4 &quot;Hypoid gears in normal severe service without severe shock loading.&quot;
API-GL-5 &quot;Hypoid gears in severest service including shock loading.&quot;
For the last 15 years I have had excellent results with a product from SWEPCO.  Their product &quot;201 Multi-gear Lubricant&quot; is recommended highly by VW and Porsche racing types and has given me good service in my '63 Type I, '77 Westy and '78 911.
The SWEPCO is available online at their site swepcousa_dot_com and is rated GL-5.  According to my lubrication source book, only use 90WT or 85W-90, not 85W-140.  I know of no reason why only GL-4 was recommended.  Sounds a little like &quot;mechanic's folklore&quot; to me.
