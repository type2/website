I have a kit which is pressurised from a tyre in the same way as a beetle
windscreen washer.  Can't say how well it works because I haven't got round
to using it yet.  It should be ideal for a bus because you could just stand
the container on the cab floor, run the air hose to the washer reservoir and
then screw the other end onto the brake fuid reservoir under the seat.
