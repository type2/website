Subject: [VB] LENTI heritage&gt; Wedding bells~ suddenly after 19 years 
  together... (fwd)

---------- Forwarded message ----------

Congratulations to Mark Blanchard and Kathy Meyers, who according to Kathy,
&quot;had a weird vibe&quot; today and stopped at a court house and got married. After 19
years and several months together they are finally hitched.
Gee, I wonder if they can live together...

Old timers from the LENTI list will remember that Kathy was (and remains) the
owner of &quot;Her Purple Majesty&quot;, a nicely done bay window bus... PURPLE with a
billion coats of clear on it with a killer interior. Extremely nice people who
deserve each other.
