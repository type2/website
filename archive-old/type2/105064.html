Subject: Re: [T2] Inexpensive head lamp

From: &quot;Chris Mills&quot; &lt;scm9985_at_tntech_dot_edu&gt;
&gt; Buy thee a $10 analog multimeter...

I have a digital meter, I use to work on PC's. :O)

&gt; ... then cycle the high beam / low beam switch...

Apparently broken.  The turn signal switch seems to be shot, the lever hangs
lose in the switch and doesn't click into either position.  I'm going to
pull it and see if I can rebuild it before I look for another one.

&gt; Notice how the white and yellow wires feed two fuses each. Each fuse
represents a headlight so that if one fuse blows then both lights don't
fail.

Ah, I didn't know that each headlight had it's own fuse.  I'll check the
fuse block first to see if there's any corrosion on the contacts, first.

Thanks, Chris.
