Subject: wide tire myth

I know it sounds like heresy, but wider tires don't necessarily handle 
better.  The can of worms is now officially open!

Many factors go into good handling: tire compound (biggest factor), tread 
design, tire temperature, slip angle and tire geometry.  It's too complex for 
me to discuss, but if you search the net under &quot;wide tire myth&quot; here are a 
few quotes from experts:

from http://www3.bc.sympatico_dot_ca/Volvo_Books/susp5.html
&quot;Take it from the guy who posted the best competitor's time in both the stock 
and modified classes of the 1993 Volvo Club of America Annual Autocross -- 
big wheels and wide tires do not necessarily provide the best performance.&quot; 

from http://www.physlink_dot_com/Education/AskExperts/ae200.cfm
It is true that wider tires commonly have better traction. The main reason 
why this is so does not relate to contact patch, however, but to composition. 
Soft compound tires are required to be wider in order for the side-wall to 
support the weight of the car. softer tires have a larger coefficient of 
friction, therefore better traction.

from http://www.womanmotorist_dot_com/MAINTENANCE/bs-tire-myths-01.shtml
&quot;In fact, the opposite is true. Wide tires tend to &quot;float&quot; on deep snow and 
the tread lugs never have a chance to &quot;dig&quot; through the snow to the road 
surface to gain traction.&quot;
