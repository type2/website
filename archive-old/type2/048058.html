A bus....underpowered?  Now what would ever make you say that?!  ;-)
Really though...I'm happy with how much power my buses have.  I run a 1600
single port with a single carb and no mods to the engine in my 71 bus, and I
have plenty of power (even with the rings a little worn)  You don't believe
me?  Well, take a look.  http://www.luckyboys_dot_com/isaiah/speeddemon.jpg  I
took that picture yesterday on the way home from the Halloween campout in
northern IL.  Even had a little bit of a headwind/crosswind.  My 62 with a
1600 single port would do 75mph too...with the stock small nut tranny.  I
only did that once though...as that is running really high rpms.  75mph in my
71 bus (Stella) is a little over 4,000 rpms.  Maybe 4200 or so?  I drive her
65 on the freeways without problems...runs good...runs cool... I'm happy.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; I have read in countless articles that early Baywindow Busses were
&gt; &gt; chronically underpowered.  Perhaps you've seen the same sort of drivel.
&gt;
&gt; Late ones, too...
