&gt; The engine masks the sound of course but it makes a gentle hum when it's
working. You turn the key, push the flap in the AFM...

Umm... I gotta a single Weber with an after-market external fuel pump
running to it.  It has that gentle hum, but no fuel injection.

I'm very grateful that it went out in a safe place close to home, that the
weather was nice, and that I was able to easily switch it out.

Gotta love that inside hatch!
