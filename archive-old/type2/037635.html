Subject: yards in San Diego

Hi All

I recently became owner of a 1971 Westy, I would say in above average
condition.
Unfortunately, I am junk yard challenged with only the bare body left on the
only
two I could find.

However, I'll be in the San Diego area soon and I'm in hopes of some yards
to wander. If
anyone out there in the SD area can pass some directions/names my way I
would
appreciate it.

On the list so far:
under dash shelf
propane setup
decent tail light housings
things I can't live without

Thanks,

Pete
