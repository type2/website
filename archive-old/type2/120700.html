Subject: gad eater?

So you are saying that your gas heater was really a
gas eater?
Duncan


&quot;...better milage after the stock heat was hooked up. 
It was 
noticable on 
a road trip cause every 3-4hours we stopped for a tank
of gas.   So 
using the 
gas heater as auxilliary to the stock heater has
better milage than 
using the 
gas heater as the sole heat source.  At least in the
bus I was driving.&quot;
