Subject: Scary Halloween pics

Boo!!!


Well, if that didn't scare you, maybe this pic will:

But here's a scarier pic: it's from the #3/4 cylinder head of the  
engine that hauled us back from John Brown's Buses:
http://www.pottsfamily_dot_ca/westfakia/Scarypics/3-4CylinderHead.jpg.  
There's no sign of the valve seat other than two dents on the head  
and a single gouge on the top of the piston.

I'm pretty sure there's more spooky stuff inside the case, but I  
haven't gotten that deep into it yet. If my guess is right the cam  
wasn't indexed to the crank properly.


Happy Trails,
