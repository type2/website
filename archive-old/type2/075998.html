'72 T-II comes through again. Made a run to America (that's what San Juan
Islanders call the mainland) with the stock '72. Took no tools nor spares,
not even a pliers or screwdriver. Locked myself out. First time since I got
it in '92?? Borrowed Uncles 2 screwdrivers a piece of wire and took about
10 minutes to catch the wing latch and force it open. 

Recently moved to new residence and filled it up with W/D and assorted
bookcases and rugs and fodder for the pantry and brought back a full load.
All functions nominal. Just what Herr Doktor Porsche had in mind for
functional utility under load when he first designed the T-II.
