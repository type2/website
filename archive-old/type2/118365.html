Subject: Re: [T2] Heater Flapper Boxes

Yes, Jason, you are correct in their function.
They are 2 year parts: 78 and 79.
Go here: http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/Microfiche/t202410.gif
And look at 11A. That is the 78/79 flapper valve that replaces 12. Left and right.
In addition, VW added 39 [a flex hose] and 41 [left and right steel pipes] that run along 
the outside of the frame to the rear.

If any one wants the valves, I have a few pairs of them. I can get the pipes when a 78/79 
shows up at the yards.

From: Jason Z Upper
The ducts I saw were about 1.5&quot; in diameter, and they ran outboard of the 
 heat exchangers.  They were metal, and they looked like little tailpipes -- 
 kinda like the exhaust pipe from a gas heater.  When I asked the owner, he 
 said they go to the heater flapper boxes, and they were there when he bought 
it.  They looked stock, and he had a 79 Camper.  I imagine these ducts allow 
 waste heat from the exchangers to get dumped out into the slipstream when 
 the heater is off.
 
 The area where the flapper boxes live is a relatively large volume that's 
 near the transmission, the fuel tank, the starter, and the front engine tin. 
 The mushroom-style vents allow waste heat to get dumped into this area, 
 while the (I'm guessing) later-style vents allow waste heat to be removed 
 from this area.  Blowing exhaust-temperature air into this area might 
 contribute to hot-start problems, heat-stressing of rubber fuel lines and 
 plastic fuel filters, and generally heating the front of the engine tin.  
 Given that all of these are good things to avoid, it makes sense to me to 
 get the heat down and away.
 
 Again, this is just conjecture on my part.  Perhaps my thinking has a fatal 
 flaw somewhere, but if I can drop a few degrees off my oil temperature on a 
 hot August run, I'm willing to give it a try.
 
 Since so much of the VW heating system has been regarded as a waste of time, 
 I imagine these stock parts are pretty hard to find, especially if they're a 
1-year-only '79 part.  However, I'm sure you can fabricate a Kustom Waste 
 Heat Transfer System from some flexible exhaust pipe. :-D
