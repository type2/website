I've found a loss of power from too little advance, but no clattering.

So, it doesn't apear to be pinging. What about a rod or main bearing noise?  I
guess you could get a valve clattering if the valve springs are heat and age
weakened.

&gt; &gt;Is the vacuum port on the Weber ported or manifold vacuum?
&gt;
&gt; I'm not sure on that one.  The port is on the bottom of the carb, not on the
&gt; manifold, so I assume it is ported vacuum.  Would there be more vacuum at
&gt; the manifold?

If it is ported, there will be no vacuum at idle.  Manifold vacuum would be
present at idle.  Use the ported vacuum if you have it.
