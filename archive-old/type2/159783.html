Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Homemade air conditioner in a VW?

Hmmm- a 12v fan mounted to blow into a &quot;drop in cooler&quot; board with a 
hole at one end to blow out the cool air-might work if you held your 
face over the air outlet-even with the mount your own kit ($21 + $10 
shipping) one could make their own for a lot less- 12v plug and a 
computer or bilge fan?
Then again, why take ice, cool some air and blow it on you when you can 
just put the ice in a drink and cool your core?  Or take the fan (we 
love Caframo fans, with the exposed safe large blades) and blow it 
directly on your face?

&gt; What do you think: which system would stay cooler longer?
