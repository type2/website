Subject: Re: [T2] PC in Bus

&gt; If you guys are looking for a good compact PC system, something like this
&gt; might work.  I haven't purchased one yet, but the dimensions are perfect for
&gt; fitting in a bus.  I'll probably get one as soon as I'm done with the more
&gt; important work on my Riviera, like replacing the rice exhaust some wise guy
&gt; decided to install on it.  :)
