Subject: Re: [T2] engine swaps

thanks Mark
          I will remember when  I have the engines out to also swap the fuel 
tanks.
 
This will insure that the wife and I will make it to the Full moon bus club  
camp outs this coming season.
 
 
I also have the complete blue plaid 75 westy interior for sale....great  
condition including the front seats.
 
Mario
