Subject: Re: [T2] Oil temp gauge

I would recommend the temp dipstick. You can keep your exisiting pressure 
switch, and you wont have to worry about speedbumps draining your oil for 
you :)
Have a great day!

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone know the best way to install an oil temp gauge?  Should I use a 
&gt;dipstick sending unit or the oil drain plug one?  Or is there another 
&gt;option I should use?  Also, is there a good resource or instructions that 
&gt;can be found on 'how' to do this or is it too easy for that?  I have a 72 
&gt;westy with a 1700 type IV 'power plant'....
&gt;
&gt;thanks in advance for any assistance
