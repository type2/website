Subject: Loose rear axle nut/rear wheel bearing problem

First off:  thank you oh great and wonderful list archive for providing
answers to most of my questions
Second:  Question that archive couldn't answer - It seems that over many
years of the axle nut being loose (before I acquired her), the rear hub has
slight recesses in it from where the inner race of the roller bearing is
pressed against it.  It has worn enough (1/16&quot;) that I believe the splines
are bottoming out before adequate pressure is being placed against all the
bearing inner races to hold the whole assembly together as it was meant to
be.  Does anyone have any suggestions?  I thought that shimming either the
shaft spacer, or the hub might work, but am worried about introducing too
many pieces into this high pressure sandwich.  Ideas?  Concerns?  Do I need
a new hub?

Frances (my '76 Westy) thanks you in advance for helping to cure her rear
end squeaks.
