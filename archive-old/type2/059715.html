Subject: Stock oil cooler?

List,
Idiot question:
I bought a 78 parts camper with all the bells and whistles including factory AC (no engine or tranny).  There are two radiator looking devices mounted under the bus - one is for the fridge, i know.  Is the other for an oil cooler?  If not, what's it for?  Many thanx.
