Just an update....
I have 1/3 of the 68-78 parts manual scanned in, and am awaiting some
manuals on my ocr program to figgure it out (waaaay too capable a system!)
I also have the complete 64-67 (i think that was the breakdown) parts
manual that Thom F scanned in, and will give it the treatment next.
This is obviously taking a LOT longer than I thought. Which is probably why
no-one with a life has done this yet!
