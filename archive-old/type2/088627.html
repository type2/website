Subject: Re: [T2] more Fri. fun - bus sightings in movies

Joel,

Maybe this has been covered before and maybe not:  We all know that in the
first &quot;Back to the Future&quot; the bad guys at the mall were driving a Bay with
a nice big sunroof, but in the end, when the doctor does the
hover-conversion, and says &quot;roads, where we're going we don't need roads&quot;
there is a white Bay parked on the left.

When the movie people reshot that scene, same words, different time, for the
sequal, the VW was replaced by a white Ford van, of late 60s, early 70s
vintage.

Have a great weekend everyone.

&gt; last weekend i saw 2 movies that both featured cameo appearances
&gt; by bay window busses, both of the 68-72 variety.
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot;
&gt; &quot;Spy Game&quot;
&gt;
&gt; only a freak like me (&amp; yourself if you are reading this) would
&gt; notice of course.
&gt;
&gt; have a great weekend everyone,
