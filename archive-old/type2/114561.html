Subject: Re: [T2] Different Seats

When the old seats wear out, they sure aren't comfortable but if only the stuffing has gone I highly recommend rebuilding the seats with the horsehair reproductions from Wolfsburg West.

I've done many 750 miles days on my rebuilt seats; VW designed them to be comfortable. I don't think the same results can be achieved with foam padding and I find my seats more confortable on long trips compared to driving in the wife's 96 japmobile.
