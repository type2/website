Subject: Auto Paint at G.I.Joes. How bad...

Hey hey, looks like I'm gonna be painting the bus at least once this
year. The first time or two is gonna be for practice, so I'm looking for
some super cheapola paint to spray on to have a better looking bus for
maybe 1 year. Then I'm gonna sand it back off the next year and re-paint
it........

 On that note, I saw gallons of automotive paint at G.I.Joes for under
forty bucks! Now of course at that price it aint gonna stay on for long
I would imagine, and it probably fades pretty fast.....
 
Cheers

Hey Chris,  For ~20 bucks per gallon you can use farm equipment paint from 
Tractor Supply Company stores; add hardener if you wish; with a little practice 
spraying, it can look great.  As for sanding off TSC or any other enamels, 
better think again.  You can buy aircraft stripper and remove the paint, but 
you will be at it 'til the onset of senility if sanding is your only method of 
paint removal, AMHIK ;-))

Sorry to be slow posting on this.... have been on the road for a coupla days.
