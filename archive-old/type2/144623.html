&gt; What a great idea Greg , let the US invades Canada !! some folks in
&gt; California thinks that California should be  attached to  Canada .

As a long-time resident of the Great American Southwest, I was under the
impression that Canada sponsored an annual invasion of the US, starting
around October and ending in April.  Thousands of Canada's most inept
drivers are sent south in giant cars and motorhomes on a mission to
spread terror on the streets of Phoenix, Tucson, Yuma, and points West.

As long as they bring some gas heaters down with them I guess I don't mind
too much...
