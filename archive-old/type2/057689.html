Subject: re: Mexibus imports

Hi all....
Sorry it took so long for me to jump in on this topic... of which.. I would
like to consider myself somewhat of an expert... I am the offical Southern
California Distributor for Beetlemex, an importer of Mexican Beetles.
There are many problems with importing these Mexican or Brazillian made
VW's...  With the beetles, we have cut through the red tape by rebuilding
the cars onto a 1972 or older pan, and using the original title to register
with.   By using cars that are 1972 or older, there is no smog required in
California, and a new registration is not neccessary...   There are several
other modifications which we make to the cars that allow them to pass the
DOT (Department Of Transportation) guidelines for allowable equipment in
the U.S., one of which requires us to replace all of the glass with DOT
approved safety shatter proof glass, which believe it or not, the Mexican
beetles are not made with at the factory.  I won't give away all of my
trade secrets.. but let's just say there are several other modifications
that must be made to pass the DOT inspection for repaired or restored
vehicles at the border.   The cars must be sold as used restored vehicles,
and may not be sold as new vehicles, since the Mexican built air cooled
VW's do not conform with many of the new vehicle requirements.

We looked into importing the Brazillian made buses... but.. there are many
problems... Firstly, the buses are not air cooled.  They use a modified
Rabbit engine, and have a radiator system placed on the front grill of the
bus, just under the big VW logo.   They utilize drum brakes all around, and
as many of you know much better than I do... separating a bus from its
chassis is not an easy accomplishment, if not an impossible one.  I am not
that techinically inclined, as I am more of the marketing/sales/operations
type but I do know that the chassis of a bus is built into the body
somehow...  sorry to all those who actually know this stuff...  This would
make it impossible for us to import them by swapping out the chassis with
VIN and older registration from a U.S. registered older bus.

I was very interested to read the post of (sorry.. I forgot the name) of
the British fellow who just imported a Brazillian bus to England.. as he
mentioned that he had a 1600 engine which seemed to have been air cooled...
I find this curious, as my contacts in Mexico who happen to own several VW
dealerships tell me that the only engine available is the water cooled
Rabbit converted engine.

By the way... driving the &quot;restored&quot; &quot;new&quot; Mexican Beetles are a blast,
especially here in Los Angeles where you really turn the heads of any VW
nut.... even if I am a &quot;bus&quot; guy more than I am a Bug guy...   Sorry to
burst the optomistic bubble of anyone contemplating the import of a South
American made bus...  But I can't see how it can be done legally.
