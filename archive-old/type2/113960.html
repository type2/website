&gt;I have a A/F meter and Standard 1 wire Bosch O2 sensor that I am going to install.  First though I need to weld a bung in.  What Size threads or an O2 sensor?  It looks like typical spark plug threads.  those are 14 mm?   Do I have to use a special weld-on or can I weld a nut that is the right size?

I can't remember what the size is but it is a common one.  You can take your O2 sensor to the hardware store and find a nut that fits it, then weld that in.  Personally I'd rather have a proper O2 bung, which you can get from any muffler shop.  It's a cleaner installation.
