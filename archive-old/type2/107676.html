Subject: Re: [T2] 71 molding clips

Mario said:
&gt; I'm just finishing up the resto on a 71 bus and need the clips that hold the 
 wide molding on the side. I haven't found a source for new, so the questions 
 are can I get new ones or does anyone know where I can get used ones?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

As far as I know, new are no longer available. They were part # 241 853 547.  
51 are needed for all the trim. Used is the only source I know of. I believe I have 54 or 55 
of them.....
