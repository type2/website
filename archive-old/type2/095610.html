Subject: RE: [T2] Body panels

&gt; Can anyone confirm these US distributors for Alan H Schofield body panels
&gt; mentioned in the archives? They have a 3 piece under the windshield repair
&gt; panel for £25.00. See #29 on http://www.ahschofield.co_dot_uk/page6.htm.
&gt;
&gt; None of the above websites have any info about this panel in
&gt; their catalogs and it's just what I need.
&gt;
&gt; I have no idea who else is making body panels for bays but is this item
&gt; available from anyone else? I understand Veng is gone but who is the other
&gt; European maker of body panels?



I carry many of the same body panels as Schofield, only distributed by Just
Kampers instead of Schofield. Of course these are at typical Bus Depot
prices. While we do stock # 29A on the page you referenced, we've never
carried # 29.  I have put a call in to find out about # 29 and will get back
to you.

Veng of Denmark did indeed liquidate, but another company, Klokkerholm,
bought their tooling and is now making the same body panels (which we do
carry).  We also import genuine VW body panels - many of them exclusive to
the Bus Depot (at least in the United States) - and ship them instead of the
repro's whenever possible.  Sometimes the price for genuine is no higher
than for a repro (when we can get it), so on occasion you may be pleasantly
surprised to receive a genuine panel instead of the repro you ordered.
However, to my knowledge neither Klokkerholm nor VW makes the particular
part you referenced, although I am checking to confirm that as well.
