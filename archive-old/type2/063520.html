&gt; hey now,
&gt; 
&gt; okay, i've been told several different things by different folks.
&gt; i'm looking for a winter oil. BUT, here are my winter conditions:
&gt; 
&gt; a) i'm in central nc.
&gt; b) i'd say average winter temp is 35-40 or so.
&gt; c) it ofter gets below freezing...
&gt; d) once in a while 15-25
&gt; e) RARELY it gets below 15.
&gt; 
&gt; i've been told 20w50 is too heavy for this climate. i'm told folks round
&gt; here run this weight all the time. i'm told 10w30 is for colder climates.
&gt; i'm told 10w30 is good for this climate. i'm told 15w40 is a good alternative.
&gt; ack! ack! ack! ack! ack!
&gt; 

Well I'm stabbing at this as I'm the one who recs 15W-40, BY THE BOOK
IE BENTLEY OR THE MANUAL THAT CAME WITH EVERY VW SINCE MULTI-VIS OILS
EMERGED IN THE 70's.

5W-20, 5W-30    -20F to 15F
10W-30          -5F to 60F (in the beginning VW recs 10W-40 as well but
                            for well known reasons 10W-40 has fallen 
                            from grace as being too highly modified, and 
                            should never IMNSHO be run in any VW)
15W-40, 15W-50  5F to 85F
20W-40, 20W-50  15F to 85F

SAE10W          -5F to 20F
SAE20/20W       15F to 50F
SAE30           30F to 85F
SAE40           70F to 100+F

OK at an average of 35-40F the book would rec either 10W-30, 15W-40
or SAE20 but the straight 20 is impossible to find and has too narrow
a range.  Now it is my tendancy to always run a bit heavier oil if
possible particularly in air cooled VW's.  A number of old timer VW
mechanics round about here (mid atlantic) swear in fact by 40 weight
in the summer, 30 weight in the fall and never mess with the multi
weight oils.  I'm sorry I inherently believe 10W-30 too thin for
this climate average say 25-30F in winter so sure wouldn't use it south
of here.  I have been running 15W-40 in all my various VW's in fall
winter since I started using it 10+ years ago in the diesel rabbit, and
have never had a problem, first using Shell Rotella now WALMARTS cheapo
Tech 2000.  Never a burst filter or nothing.  I scoff at my idiot
roomate who belives his damn Acura manual that says 5W-30 year round
(like new GM stuff as well) might save energy see if it saves engines.
I'm waiting for that gorgeous 16V to seize rock solid at about 80k miles
when he's spooling it past 7000 rpm on a 95F summer day with the A/C on.

Just my observations, I'd love some debate.
