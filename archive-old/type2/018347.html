According to my dearest hubby type person, my bus' engine gets hot when
running, and if it gets too hot, it starts to lose power.  If it loses
power you have to slow down and if you slow down (drop rpms I guess) the
engine either starts to cool off or if it doesn't cool off, it frys on
you.  Either way you get an eventually cooler engine, though in one case
it is cooler, but doesn't run . . .
