According to Texaco, Pale Oil is A base or process oil refined until  
its color, by transmitted light, is straw to pale yellow.

Then again...NOCO says Pale Oils are light coloured, non-staining  
naphthenic oils refined from specially selected wax-free crude  
through the use of severe hydrogenation. This process produces oils  
of excellent initial colour and colour stability while maintaining  
their compatibility with most synthetic elastomers.
