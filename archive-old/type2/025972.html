T. Neal sends:

&gt; (1) What are the likely cause[s] that would allow gasoline
&gt; to seep into the crankcase and mix with the oil? This seems VERY sudden, as
&gt; in materializing only in the approx. 150 miles since I last changed the oil
&gt; - before that the oil stayed at a pretty constant level below the full
&gt; line.

Is the 5th injector turning off like it's supposed to? Fuel in the crankcase
is usually caused by a very rich condition; all the fuel can't burn in its
allotted time so some of it blows by the rings into the crankcase. If the
5th injector is staying on all the time, that would do it.
