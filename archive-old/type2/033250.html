Hmm, only somewhat, though: The (non-turbo) diesel has less power than
your 1800, and the vanagon shell is bigger, heavier and less aerodynamic.

That's interesting. I remember that when the Vanagon was first introduced VW
advertised the fact that although the bay windows 'looked' more
aerodynamical the Vanagon actually has less drag. The bay-windows were
designed with round curves to make it look fast but when the Vanagon was
designed the wind-tunnel had made its way into car design. Square shapes do
not always mean it is less aerodynamic. It's the little curves round the
corners and various other shapes that count.  Remember the Vanagon is wedge
shaped. That probably does quite a bit to improve drag.

Having said that and being the owner of both bay-window buses and a 1600
diesel Vanagon:

= I like my '81 1600cc non-turbo diesel but it is sooooooo sloooooow.
= My '69 1600cc SP bay runs quite a bit faster.

Both are rated at 50 hp (well 47 actually for the SP).
