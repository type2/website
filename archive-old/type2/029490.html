&gt; &gt; Hi all -
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; OK, here goes:  might anyone know where a longish (in the vicinity of the
&gt; &gt; top crankshaft bolts length) bolt w/a three prong ground (?) attachment
&gt; &gt; might go&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; It is one of the two bolts that attach the engine to the bellhousing, if I
&gt; remember correctly the one on the drivers side.

Hmmm... I had advised him that it was the thru-bolt from the case seam
that is second or third from the top front of the case.  My reason for
doing so is that the tabbed washer that he speaks of is for the FI
grounds, and that is where they are on my '80.  On my bus, these tabs are
on the left side of the seam, under the air distribution box.

More information would settle this...  Mark, is it an M8 or an M10
diameter bolt?  What is the length?  Tho not ironclad, if the nut takes a
13mm socket, then it is probably an M8 (8mm diameter) bolt, but if it
takes a 15 or 17mm socket, then it is more likely to be an M10 (10mm
diameter) bolt.
