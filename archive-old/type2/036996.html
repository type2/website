&gt; one way to check is to see if you can hear the fuel pump running, near
&gt; left rear  wheel well is the electric fuel pump, when you turn on ignition
&gt; it will pump for a few seconds, then shut off,

NO NO NO!!!
The fuel pump will NOT run for a few seconds when you turn the key on.
Only the later water-cooled Digijet did this, not air-cooled AFC.
