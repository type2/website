&gt;No thanks.
&gt;
&gt;If I spend money (not effort), it will be to go with a wood, coal
&gt;stove. : )
&gt;Anyone do this?



Funny you should mention that Thom.

A buddy of mine is working on a heater for his camper..........non VW... its
one of those old converted aluminum body step vans. I try to enlighten him
but he claims he is claustraphobic.

Anyway this is the idea. There is a local company that makes pellet heating
stoves, the type with an auger that feeds the fire box with pellets made
from wood waste. They also make a pellet fueled  bar-b-q grill. He is buying
the auger drive, motor and controlls from the  bar-b-q system which are
pretty compact, and fabricating a small fire box that will meet his specs.
Sounds kind of nifty to me. Safe, controllable and efficient.... or so he
says. Haven't seen anything yet but if anyone is interested in his design
I'll try and get some more details.
