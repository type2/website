&gt; You may still have the original 71 trany.
&gt; 
&gt; That's the earlier style 68-70 pressure plate, and through out bearing you
&gt; have in there now.  Is it working well?

My '71 came with the old style setup.  It was a big surprise when my
rebuilt transmission arrived and I had to swap clutches too!
