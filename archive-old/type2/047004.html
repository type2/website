Try a R.V supply store. That is where I usually go for the camper stuff.
They have great fiberglass restoration type cleaners.

Any ideas how to get that like new white back to a westy pop top without 
painting. I've heard     X-14 works, but can't find it anywhere.

Also, still looking for a 76-78 westy interior sink cabinet (prefer with 
burner), any ideas??

Thanks, Bob Kirk
