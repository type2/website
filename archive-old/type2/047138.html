Subject: Re: [T2] child cot...do you have...

&gt; so it looks like im in business, minus one thing.
&gt;  i dont have the hooks that go on the pillars.  the
&gt; bus it came out of was stripped down inside so they
&gt; were not attached.   i looked through my couple boxes
&gt; of stuff i took from the bus and i dont see anything
&gt; that looks like em.  so does anyone on the list have a
&gt; set that they would be willing to part with?  the vw
&gt; boneyards in the midwest are basically non existant.
&gt; if you can help me out, let me know by p-mail.

There are lefts and rights, mirror opposites.
The reason 68 to 73 is 56 1/4&quot; and  74-75 is 57 1/4&quot; is not that the 74 is
wider.....it is because of the location of the half-moons. VW dropped them
down lower in 74, so the bars are longer.
68 bars are black and round. They bend very easily. I think VW realized this
and remade them starting in 69 out of stamped, 3 sided galvanised
steel....much stronger.
I have about a dozen sets of half-moons. If you want  a set, what's your
address?
