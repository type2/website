Subject: RE: [T2] head removal &amp; vw tech article

Mike,

Speaking from experience, your first engine pull is the hardest, but at
the same time is also a great learning period. During the removal and
reinstall you learn all the little quirks your bus/bug/aircooled beast
has, and you learn how to work with them for the next time. As for
heads, I cant give you much help there, I havent had to remove any yet,
so I would like to know the answer to that for future reference.

Jonathan

P.S. Make sure that the accel. cable is out of the way of the tranny
when you reinstall the engine, once you kink up that cable its time to
get a new one. Ask me how I know.
