&gt; Nate, Care to share the name of this place? I'm working up a list of VW
&gt; sources and I'd love to include this one.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks! Joe

&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone ever visit Wilson's Salvage in Oklahoma City?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Derrick Zimmerer of WayOut Salvage in Kingston, AR said it was the largest
&gt; &gt; &gt; VW graveyard in the US.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone care to confirm or refute this?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I would refute it. There's one in Central Iowa - about 45 min northeast
&gt; &gt; of Ames, Iowa that has the most complete collection of $50-$500 VWs I've
&gt; &gt; ever seen. Most run, and are in salvagable shape, and they part things
&gt; &gt; out for $5-$10 a part, dpending. They have probably close to 6-700 of
&gt; &gt; all types, and ALL are air-cooled.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I've not seen many like this, and others may be bigger, but this one is
&gt; &gt; run by an old guy who knows everything about every part he's got, and
&gt; &gt; works on the like a pro.

Well, that was smoothness personified. I have about 35 letters here in
front of me, begging me for the name of the place and a phone number.

I had thought I couldn't find it, but I did some digging, and even
called the guy a coupla minutes ago to check on what he has.

The place is called:

        Services Diversified...212 S Pearl...Zearing, IA 50278
Phone: (515)487-7629

And he says that they're down from about 750 air-cooled Vdubs to about
250, but that they saved all of the better parts, and have everything
stacked and labeled. They mostly deal in type 2s, from '58 - '90.

They have about 80 complete parts busses, and don't get much business in
Iowa - mostly they DELIVER (can you believe it) or mail order stuff, but
anyone is welcome to show up at any time to poke through the yards.

If you call, talk to either Ron or Sherry Blattle, and mention the list
and my name, and they'll treat you right. As I recall, they were very
fairly priced, and overstocked with everything.

Good luck, and let me know what happens...
