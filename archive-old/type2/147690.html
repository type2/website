&gt;aahhhh to cut the story short, the answer is *****Canada*****.
&gt;
&gt;And what's more, it has been forthe last **seven** years in a row.
&gt;
&gt;So what do I hear this morning on NPR?
&gt;Canada's currency value has gone up 40% in the last year or two and is now 
&gt;a *hot* commodity in the money market since their money is now known
&gt;as a &quot;petrodollar&quot;.

And it means that you get less oil for each USD as the CDN dollar strengthens.

I'm moving back when the CDN dollar is par with the US again. That's the best gift Dubya Gump could have given Canadians who need to buy bus parts. :-)

&gt;On the same NPR show this morning, it was revealed that the &quot;tar sands&quot; of 
&gt;Canada has ***more*** oil available in it than all of the Saudi oil 
&gt;fields.

In school they used to teach us that the bitumen was too expensive to extract. Fortunately the OPEC price of oil is so high that it's become affordable. Alberta's economy is doing well as a result.

&gt;So, the big question....why is the regular media always harping on opec?
&gt;I won't ask the other rhetorical questions about why we are in certain 
&gt;places...I leave those questions up to the reader&lt;grin&gt;.

If they blamed the Canadians they wouldn't be ignorant pundits. Besides, who's gonna believe Canadians are the enemy and then use that fact to ruin pristine Alaskan wilderness. :-)

Seriously, the US is a global bully but in as far as Canada is concerned they would have no problem taking the oil for pennies on the dollar like they do with fish, softwood lumber, electricity, water rights, and so on.
