nope.  (except the lug wrench which is the crank)

&gt; If there is, I just dont get it. I mean, I understand how it (could) work, 
&gt; but the piece that moves up along the inside of the jack doesnt have 
&gt; anything to keep it extended out and under the bus rather than falling limp 
&gt; into the jack again.

right, stuff it in the hole in the side of the bus made for it. hold it
straight until it touches the ground (make sure opposite wheel is chocked)
then it will stay.

IMO, I wouldn't use the VW jack to hold up a table leg.  the thing is
worthless.  throw a bottle jack of the right size in there and use the VW
jack for show and tell
