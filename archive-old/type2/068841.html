&gt; Hi, Jeff-- Somebody else mentioned this too [Joel?  Sorry, whoever,], but
&gt; I'm not sure I get it.  I'm sitting here running simulations with a slice
&gt; of my breakfast toast [&quot;okay, this end with the jelly hanging over is the
&gt; rear end of the bus, and this glass of orange juice is my direction of
&gt; travel . . . &quot;] and I can't figure out why it would be different. 
&gt; 
&gt; So why is it a different problem if the front breaks traction first rather
&gt; than the rear? [With a rear engine drive, wouldn't this be the usual way
&gt; it would happen?] And what *do* you do if the front end comes around? 
&gt; [Yeah, yeah, I know:  &quot;Bend over and . . . &quot;  Besides that, I mean.]

When the Rear slides to the right, to maintain control one turns the 
steering wheel as if making a right turn, thus keeping the front 
wheels traveling in the correct direction, relative to the ground.
This is known as steering into the slide.

Even though the engine is in the rear, VW's more easily lose traction 
in the rear due to the drive wheels being there.  Less likely than 
front engined vehicles, but that's where the ususal lack of traction 
begins.  Over power it and you will slip in the back.

When the Front wheels lose traction, say right, the only friction in the 
front is the wheels sliding sideways against the ground.  Turning the 
wheels to the right, to be rolling in the direction of the slide reduces the 
friction and thus speeds up the sliding.  Using brakes at this 
point to reduce the rolling friction ends up in locking the brakes in 
the rear wheels, thus one is now spinning.

The following is speculation, haven't BTDT.
If your front end does lose traction, keep the wheels 90 degrees to 
the direction of the front end until your speed is slow enough and 
the pavement is such that one can have some success with the brakes.
This should work at slow speeds.  
At high speeds the sudden transition from front tires sliding sideways 
on ice to sliding sideways on pavement could cause a sudden braking 
motion of the front end going sideways and may result in a roll.

Can't think of a way to set up this situation is a parking lot.  It's 
easy to force the rear end to slide (hand brake or goosing the 
engine).  Forcing the FRONT to suddenly slide, don't know.

Also as I posted to Bill,
