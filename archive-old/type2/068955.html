Subject: Re: '67 seat bolts

&gt;I need a few bolts and fittings to hold down the center and rear seats on
&gt;my '67 standard.  I haven't found any in catalogues...Does anyone have
&gt;any for sale?

I think those are same as in early bays? VW Bus Heaven carries them new.
They cost (ready?) $10 apiece.
