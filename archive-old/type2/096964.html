Subject: Buses by the Springs pictures

Hello all,
	Went to Buses by the Springs this last weekend and it was great.
Yes, this means my bus is finally running good again.  I believe
initially it was the afm that went bad.  Then I must have bent the
distributor bracket during all the troubleshooting so that had to be
replaced.  I got it to run with a replacement afm from Karl (thanks) but
it would not run right still.  Turned out that while troubleshooting the
injectors, one of the small seals did not make it back on.  DOH!  Put it
back on and the runs like a champ. Thanks for everyone's help during all
that.  Amazing what a vacuum leak can do.  As reported earlier, there
were about 13 busses and a new Beetle.  The weather was awesome and the
potluck dinner was great.  Although I did not take very many pics this
time around, I did post some pics here
www.wicals_dot_com/bus/pics/shows/bbts .  Thanks again to Diana for putting
on a great show.

Enjoy
