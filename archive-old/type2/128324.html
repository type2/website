You could also add clean water from any water source (within reason) by using a hiker's filter pump. Make WONDERFUL water but it is going to take all day to fill a Westy tank... 

Chris

thanks so much for all the help and to those not listed in the To: field above....

all suggestions taken seriously and i am now on my way out to see about getting this done so i can get the fridge/sink installed...so we can use it this weekend camping hopefully... the sink is suppose to work or as far as PO knew it did.. but hey it was free no complaints here..

course i will have to wait till Dr phi goes off watching John kerry interview...so awesome....

PLEASE VOTE this election.... your country needs you....~!~

peace and love

chris
