Subject: Re: Bus ancestry - the dymaxion car?

Sorry to continue this thread, but I am sitting here working letting some
Grateful Dead tunes fill my ears, and noticed the picture of a car on the
inside of the Skeletons From The Closet album, and thought &quot;Hey, I wonder if
the Dead put a picture of that Bucky Fuller-mobile on one of their albums?&quot;

Well, is there both a deadhead AND Dymaxion fan out there?  What is this
car on the album?  Rear engine, with those louvers, but looks like a three
wheeler to me...
