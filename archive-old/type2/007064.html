Re: [T2] My New Westy!!
&gt;  
&gt;  Being new to VW's...
&gt;  
&gt;  What is 
? How do you detect, and fix it?

In China Cat (75 Westy) it was on the outside...in the front wheel wells. The 
large bracket shaped roughly like an upside-down ham were rusty all round the 
bottom beam and up in front of the snubber boss that sticks out. the lower 
beam would have come adrift it the wheel hit a hard bump.

Check 'em carefully, mate :-)
