&gt; As it turns out...I spoke too soon. I put in new brushes and had my GEN

&gt; According to the test I did, it appears to be toast. I've gotten the
&gt; funding from the treasurer (my wife) to go for the alternator upgrade.
&gt; Can someone enlighten me as to what this entails. I'm assuming this is
&gt; an engine in operation or it's a no go for now. It looks like I have the
&gt; generic gen/alt stand already in place, but I won't know absolutely for
&gt; sure until I get into it I guess. I know I'll need a new fuel pump and
&gt; rod, is that it??

I'm assuming that you have the correct 38A generator installed in your
bus.

to go to an alternator, you need:

Alternator

The round tin (3 pieces) that goes into the fan shroud for a bug
(alternator or 30A generator)

Fan hub from a beetle (alternator or 30A generator)

Alternator stand

Alternator style fuel pump and rod (you really don't need these, but you
can't get the tall fuel pump off if an alternator is there.

Some flat copper strip to bypass the voltage regulator (big wire to big
wire, small wire to small wire)

A few assorted connectors.

If you have a bug (30A) generator on your bus, you won't need the tin or
the fan hub.
