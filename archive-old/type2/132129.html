&gt; Just for interest sake,, do you know what it was originally built for?
&gt; It has a engine case code CV

CV engine is 80-83 vanagon:

&gt; I am leaning towards removing the steel tube in the block and fitting the
&gt; stock
&gt; breather box plastic outlet that bolts on.

You don't have to remove anything. You can just use a vanagon breather
fitting. It will bolt up perfectly. I have a spare of you want it. It is
like a bus one without the sheet metal can, it is just a non-return valve
that plugs into the top flared tube in the case. The hose to the s-tube is
the same size and shape as on a bus.

&gt; 
&gt; The other problem is the head Temp Sensor hole is buggered,, so  I need to fix
&gt; them.
&gt; I was thinking of sourcing a M10X1 tap.... but the hole is already too big.
&gt; Sounds
&gt; like a heli coil job...

I would stay away from any sort of putty, as it will certainly change the
temperature characteristics of the area that the sender is bolted into. I
have the taps if you need to borrow them, starting and plug. If the head is
off the engine, just have the area welded and re-tap it. It is not a
difficult area to weld. Helicoil will work but it is an odd size. I have a
complete helicoil master set but I don't recall m10 x 1.0 in there. I can
get timesert kit for the job, but I wouldn't invest in it for one hole of an
oddball size.
