&lt;&lt; someone said recently here that if i am backfiring when i decelerate it
 means i have a lean mix? i am in CA and have all this cool smog crap on my
 bus which i disconnected. (either way it b/f's)i do not have big backfires,
 just these small mini ones when i decel. does that still mean i have a lean
 mix? and how the heck to i mix it right? i've never had my carbs redone
 since i have dual carbs and it'll cost too much to fix. after november i am
 planning to rip out my dual carbs an switch to single carb so i dont want to
 redo my duals now. anything i can do in the meantime that doesnt cost 50
 million dollars? thanks :)
 
 regards, dave :) &gt;&gt;


My bets would be on an exhaust leak.Check around where the muffler connects to
the heater boxes.
