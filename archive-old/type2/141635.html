Subject: Re: [T2] Steering gear box leaking?

Thank you to those who replied here is what I have found in my search.

I have found a strange market for steering gearboxes for the worm and roller
gearboxes on our busses.

First you can buy a rebuilt one for $200-$400, but I can't find a rebuild
kit, that is a bit disturbing.

Second I could buy a new TRW unit for $200, any one try one of these?

Third I could buy the seal called out in the bentley manual page 2-21 for
$5.49 at Napa autoparts, the same seal is used on BMW and Mercedes boxes,
but can not find this seal from any of the VW parts dealers online.

I think I will reseal it, and save hundreds.


&gt; My 76 bus has a new leak and it appears to be from the steering gearbox
does
&gt; that occur often?

&gt; Does anyone know where I can get a rebuild/seal kit?
