Gil... I'd love to know if this is true,, But I know it has nothing to do
with resistance,, the gauge is a thermocouple,,
Can the wires to the Thermocouple be lengthened?? - I *think* not,, but
*maybe* it isn't enought to matter!?

The CHT meters use thermocouple wire which is what generates the voltage
that the meter uses.  Thermocouple wire is a pair of wires made of two
dissimilar metals.  For instance, one wire being iron and the other
constantan.  The two wires are brought together at the point of temperature
measurement (cylinder head) and the dissimilar metals generate a millivolt
level that is directly proportional to  temperature. When you lengthen those
wires , you are creating yet another dissimilar metal
junction and an offset voltage (error) is generated at that junction,
either adding or
subtracting from the correct voltage showing at the gauge as Temperature

By all means, lenghten your wires,, then try it in a controlled temp
environment,, like a oven, and report back the results.

If you *CAN* add wiring without adverse effects, this would certainly
prove benificial to placing the gauge where ever you want.
