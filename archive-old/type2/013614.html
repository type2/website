Hey there,

The basics are covered in Bentley and Haynes. You do have a manual,
right ?? 

I would also make sure that the problem is definitely the switch, and
not another part of the starting system. Replacing a battery or
starter is alot easier then replacing the switch. (You probably have
already checked the easy stuff, but I figured I'd mention it).

You didn't say what year bus you have but check out:

http://www.mhtc_dot_net/~bclausen/How_to.htm  for later bays.

http://website.lineone_dot_net/~mike_howles2/barrel/barrel.html for early
bays.

Also check out the rest of Mike Howles page. Lots of good stuff at:

Hope this helps,
