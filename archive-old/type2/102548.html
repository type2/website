Subject: Re: [T2] Re Bizarre failing in 75 FI; fuel liny query

Mike,

Sounds like my problems with my 78 before I cleaned the tank out.

Pics at http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/78bustankjob/

Picture #12 shows what came out of my tank.  Basically when the fuel level 
was below the rim of the anti-slosh &quot;bowl&quot; in the tank, I could get enough 
fuel to drive for 3.5 miles and then die....wait 10 minutes and it slowly 
seeped back into the bowl area and I could drive it home.

The clue was to leave the fuel pressure gauge hooked up till it started 
dying and then watch it slowly drop to below 22-24psi...engine dies then.

Richard has better pics of what his tank looks like inside, don't know if 
the 75 would be the same or not.

Cheers, dave

&gt; To list- you seem knowledgable on parts----My ex-Porsche mechanic that
&gt; did Nyssa's bus figures over the phone that the 75 likely had fuel
&gt; starvation -its main clue was that after it refused to make it up a hill
&gt; (push clutch in, rev it up, let it out, goes &quot;plup-plup-plup&quot; and has NO
&gt; poop (no acc), I let it sit to wait for my wife to bring a
&gt; chain....after ten min checked it, and it ran OK enough to get home the
&gt; next 2 miles.
