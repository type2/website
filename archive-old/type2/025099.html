Seth,

It will fit, your bus will run.

however, whether it &quot;works&quot; or not is a matter of debate.....

The advance curve is wrong for the type 4 engine.
It does not provide the total advance that the type 4 engine needs.
There are no timing specs for it on the type 4 engine, you will have to fudge 
it.
You can get the timing close to correct at 3400rpm OR idle, but NOT for both.

You will lose some performance and drivability.  (otherwise EVERY bus would 
have come with one originally!!)

How much are you willing to compromise your bus for the savings in $$?  It 
WILL work; you will just have to decide what you might lose by using it as an 
alternative and whether its_worth_it_or_not.

I personally would get one of the dual advance distributors that 
Aircooled_dot_net sells.  they provide centrifugal advance based on engine rpm 
PLUS you get additional advance based on carb venturi vacuum, (for that 
little extra kick, just when you need it).  You can also gain up to 4 extra 
mpg in fuel economy.  

(They are similar to what the bus originally came with)
