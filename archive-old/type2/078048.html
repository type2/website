&lt;&lt; SVDA on a Type4 bus engine? &gt;&gt;

Das,

I know that at least 1979 &quot;49 state&quot; versions came with them.  
 
&lt;&lt; I'm having real problems with 009 on a type 4.  What
 should I time it at to get the most driveable
 combination (just until I get a better dizzy)? &gt;&gt;

Set it for at least 30 or so degrees at full (~3500 rpm) advance.  It really 
needs around 40, but you will probably have to wait until you find a better 
dist. for that.

A bumper sticker we'd like to see on the next gas guzzling SUV with an
