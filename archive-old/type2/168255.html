&gt; Jason,
&gt;
&gt; I don't broker art, so you are on your own! :)
&gt;
&gt; You will have to commission one of my pieces to see my welding. Or come
&gt; baby-sit my son, answer my phone and emails so I can take the dozen or so
&gt; hours to setup, photograph, edit, post and write copy on the welding
&gt; images.
&gt; Not as easy as it sounds when you have projects backed up several months.
&gt; Unlike Kelly and other Auto Restorers, I don't really have to prove my
&gt; process to clients, I only sell the result. Unfortunately for the curious,
&gt; I
&gt; don't bother with the intensive in-process photo-documentation. My
&gt; documentation in the form of sketches and notations is safely kept in my
&gt; sketchbook or on my Tablet PC.
&gt;
&gt; However the curious are welcome to come by the studio and volunteer their
&gt; time doing the hard labor of art and I'll show them the few tricks I have
&gt; picked up with the fancy welders.
&gt;
&gt; As for bus content, I spent my first real day off in 4 months up at
&gt; BustedBus getting a '79 Westy ready for its long trip to SoCal. On Monday
&gt; she is jumping on the back of a transport truck and going to a very cool
&gt; new
&gt; owner who will show the old girl some surf and sun. Word to the wise
&gt; though,
&gt; if at all possible, avoid any Vanagon to Bay engine swaps. We have
&gt; nicknamed
&gt; the conversion Van-again-and-again-and-again because there are more
&gt; challenges than rewards. But no hippy fixes and we did it right, it just
&gt; took a bunch of time.
&gt;
&gt; Y'all have a good weekend and close the welding thread for a while. I'll
&gt; try
&gt; to shoot more in-process images at some point and I'll let y'all know.
&gt;
&gt; Peace,
&gt;
&gt; Jon Stiles
&gt;


Blah blah blah blah excuses excuses...

Seriously though. When can I come by and start taking lessons??? ;-) I think
my &quot;abstract&quot; art might be a big seller for all those la-tee-da folks from
Cali!
