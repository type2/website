Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Is the end near? Few VW buses seen at premier
  hippie gathering!

&gt; Hopefully I won't upset anyone with these comments, but I typically see 3 or
4 &quot;types&quot; of people driving VW Busses.
&gt;
&gt; 1 - Car Collectors (normal car guys, or retired hippies)
&gt; 2 - Dead Heads ( I see several Busses with Jerry Garcia stickers, pot leaf
stickers, etc...)
&gt; 3 - Surfers (usually people in their early 20s to late 30s).
&gt; 4 - It's very rare, but I do occasionally see people actually USING their
Busses as a method of transportation / work vehicle.

I have a lot of fun commuting in my ultra-clean '79 Westy... And I'm a
non-pothead advertising professional with short hair ! I *will* admit
there's a Yonder Mountain Stringband sticker on the back window, and
that I go to a lot of music festivals, but we also use the bus as a
semi-daily-driver family car, even though we have a new-ish Audi and
an older BMW as well. In fact, I'm in the process of selling my
perfectly reliable (and air-conditioned!) '97 Chevy pickup because I
just don't use it anymore. But yeah, I do get lots of comments from my
coworkers about being a damn dirty hippie.

The bus is resting in the driveway this week, as it's been up around
100: the last few days and the BMW still has working a/c. I know, I'm
weak... and so very ashamed...

Oh, and I'll
