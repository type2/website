Subject: [T2] On the subject of paint

&gt;I've got my '70 here and it has plenty of rust to work out,
&gt;some patches I have to put in and such.
&gt;I daily drive this bus, so it can't be down for too long with any one repair.
&gt;But that is exactly what I want to do...   repair.
&gt;So, here's my question.  I want to rid of the rust, and prep the metal in a preferable manner.
&gt; I'm also seeing a lot of wincing at rattle can primers
&gt;Aside of taking it off of the road, how do the experienced group members recommend I proceed?

This is an example of a very good plan with the foresight to get information
before you drop time and money into the job. You have seen the unhappy
result of trying to cut corners with inferior technique and materials. It's really
a question of what will make you happy with your bus. Unfortunately, a proper
repaint can be labor intensive when done right. You may find that you have to
remove the glass, doors, etc. and that makes it unavailable as a daily driver.
If you lack the skills, i would suggest you investigate local resources, like
adult education, for welding and painting classes. These places often allow you
to bring your own vehicle for the class, and, using their tools and resources,
you develop your skills and get the van repainted at the same time.
If you are really inclined to go this route, perhaps it would be a good excuse to
get another daily driver ( a real good reason to get another bus:)

 &gt;I'm armed with my 4&quot; grinder, my electric sander, but not a lot more.
&gt;I can get what I need to, but have no garage to work in.
&gt;So I've tied one of my hands and both of my feet behind my back
&gt;and want to refinish my bus in the driveway.  :-)

Good Luck,
Dave\X/
