Subject: bus rally, vacation trip, silly question?
Message-ID: &lt;378FB2E9.6934843A_at_gte_dot_net&gt;

hi all
    the bus rally seems fun...count me in (work permitting). maybe we
can get one of the vw mags. to cover the rally??

the other thing is that i will be vacationing , and will be taking me
bus from ventura to las vegas to the grand canyon.....does anyone have
any suggestions for this trip??? places to go, or stop along the way,
camping ect... also any tips needed for driving in the dessert that i
may need to know....i just purchased my bus (first vw) a couple of
months ago and am currently restoring it. so i am a newby.

also i have a silly question that has been on my mind: why do so many
bus's have no rear bumper, or a cut down rear bumper???? i don't think
this has anything to do with a cal look....is it for muffler reasons???

later
