Subject: sticky fuel pump solved...on to other problems
Message-ID: &lt;NOFGPDDHBAHEAAAA_at_theglobe_dot_com&gt;

Well, I plugged in a spare relay and now the fuel pump goes off as it should when the bus stalls or fails to start. So that, I surmise, was a problem caused by the relay.

I plugged in my spare ECU to see if I could get her to run past a quick start-up, but no dice. I was thinking that she was running off fuel from the cold start valve, but I'm starting to back off that hypothesis as she's running too long to be getting fuel only from the cold start valve. Other thing, I continue to get fuel in my oil. I changed the first batch of oil to fix some oil leaks and it had a lot of gas in it. I ran that for about 20 minutes in the bus. I assumed she was running really rich. But I've got a lot of fuel in the oil from cranking her today. Granted, the fuel pump was running part of the time when I couldn't get the starter to hit, but I'm wondering if maybe I have a problem with the fuel pressure regulator. Maybe it's not regulating, causing too high of pressure and subsequent flooding right after startup?

I don't have a fuel pressure gauge, but I can tell that I need to get one. There's no other way I know of to check for a bum pressure regulator.

I've got another serious problem that I haven't mentioned here on the list, but maybe someone can offer advice. The passenger side heat exchanger isn't sealing against the head. I can hear the leak, even though I'm not running for very long. Back during the 20 or so minutes that the bus *did* run, Ken Hooper listened and confirmed major exhaust leak over there. What I did was pull the Heat Exchanger and put in another pair of sealing rings (2nd set)...thinking the HE wasn't seating all the way in. That seems to have reduced the leakage, but no where near eliminated it. I'm now thinking about leading the top of the HE to fill any pits and valleys and to give the brass sealing rings a malleable substance to mate with. Any ideas? I also thought about using some exhaust sealer compound, but I'm afraid that wouldn't stand up to the heat.

Thanks! Joe

&gt;I can try.

&gt;Yeah, try a spare relay.  Can't hurt.  I think the only thing that might
&gt;affect, though, is the fuel pump staying on situation.
