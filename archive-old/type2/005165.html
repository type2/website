Subject: Upright engine in a 72?

I was good and read the archives before I posted this, it did answer that an
upright will fit in a 72, however I couldn't find any mentions if
modifications would be needed. If their are any, what? I plan on rebuilding
the pancake engine if it is bad when I get to check it out. I have an extra
upright 1600 dp that I could install for the short term. This will help in
the decision to purchase this bus or not.
Thanks for any help.
