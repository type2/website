Opps....I meant  Type 4 engine to a Type 1 engine conversion...?

(Thanks Gregg P. for your quick response to my previous post)

I want to take my recently new BAP type motor from my 71 Westy and
place it in my 79 VW type 4 (no compression on #3 cylinder).   

My 71 Westy   needs to be taken off the road for a year to do a complete
restore on the body.   I plan to purchase a new motor for it again.

I was quoted a $6k figure to rebuild the type 4.   Power is not an issue
with me, I drive slow. (Even parked cars pass me once in a while).

I found that the Mexican vans nevered used the type 4 motor and stayed with 
the type 1 motor.

The issues I have have researched....

Tin to enclosed the motor, I sound a fiberglass kit for this on aircool_dot_net

Clutch - use the 3 finger pressure plate.

Gas cable - needs to be longer

Gas pump - not to use the electric FI (to high of a pressure). use the Type 1 
gas pump.

various changes to electrical...seems minor

These were brought to my attention my memeber of the vintageVW list.

Am I missing anything else...?

Has anyone done this....? Comment or suggestions
please.

Thank you,
