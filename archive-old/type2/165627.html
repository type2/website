&gt; any of you have experience with these.

Skeptical is good.  Let's look at their claims:

    * 5% or More Fuel Mileage Increase
    * 8 to 14-times Less Engine Wear
    * Extended Oil and Filter Service Life
    * Up to 18% Less Toxic Exhaust Emissions

&quot;8 to 14-times Less Engine Wear&quot;

What does that mean?  You can reduce wear by some percentage or to a
fraction of its previous rate, but you can't have &quot;14 times less&quot; wear.
It's a claim meant to impress the ignorant.

&quot;Up to 18% Less Toxic Exhaust Emissions&quot;

Yeah, right!

Definitely snake oil.  Magnets can collect ferrous metal particles, but
most of the particles in your engine are non-ferrous.  The steel is the
hardest metal in the engine so it wears the least.

If you really want to play with magnets, go to this outfit:

and get a hefty neodymium magnet or two.  Stick them to the outside of
your filter and you'll be in business.
