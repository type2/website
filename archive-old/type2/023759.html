Hi volks,

&gt; Since we seem to be discussing tires/wheels........

&gt; The PO put tires on the front that have very short sidewalls, which
&gt;  I don't understand or like and hope to rectify soon. So I've been 
&gt; looking for as much tire info as I can find. I'm confused, though. 
&gt; He's got 14 inch tires on the bus but I went out to measure the 
&gt; rims and they look like 15 inch to me! Am I just measuring wrong
&gt; or what? Or is there some trick to wheel dimensions?

 There is a substantial lip on the rim, so if you measure the metal
that you can see it will come to over 14&quot;. 14&quot; is the diameter of 
the part of the rim the bead of the tyre actually sits on. You can
only see this if there is no tyre on the rim.

 Go by the size of the tyre, as printed on the sidewall. It should
say something like &quot;185R14C&quot; but probably says something more
like &quot;195/60R14&quot;.
 The first, three digit, number is the width of the tyre (in millimetres).
 The part after the &quot;/&quot; in the second case is the &quot;section&quot;
	or aspect ratio. The number is the height of the
	sidewall expressed as a percentage of the width, so
	in this case the sidewall will be about 60% of 195mm (~117mm).

	If there is no &quot;/&quot; or number then the tyre has a section of
	82% (used to be standard, at one time), so the first tyre
	has a sidewall height of 82% of 185mm (~152mm).
 The &quot;R&quot; indicates that this is a radial construction tyre- virtually
	all modern P/LG vehicle tyres are of this type.
 The final two digits are the rim size expressed in inches. This is
	the number you're looking for to see what size rims you have.

 The final part of the first example is the letter &quot;C&quot;, this shows
that it's a commercial vehicle tyre but, as with many designations
in the tyre industry, it is an &quot;old&quot; standard and not necessarily
widely understood.

 Be warned that appropriate tyres for buses are hard to find in the
USA. It appears to be common for tyre stores to mislead buyers into
getting the wrong ones (as your PO has done) and this can be 
dangerous. Do not let them convince you that the ones they have on
the shelf at $35 a pop are perfectly adequate because they almost
certainly are not!!!

 Have a long look at the type2 list website's library section and
spend as much time as you can spare trawling through the endless
discussions on the topic in the archives. Get informed and decide
what is right for you given your budget and the type of driving
you do and then insist that you get what you want, not what the
tyre jockey tells you &quot;will do&quot;. I think that many such people
think that because the bus is relatively slow anything will do 
but that doesn't take into account its weight, height or 
susceptibility to crosswinds etc. The weight rating of the tyre
is critical.

Hope this helps.

Cheers,
	 W.
