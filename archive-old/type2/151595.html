&gt;Locally, someone else had the same problem you have
&gt;described, but her problem cause was her air flow
&gt;sensor flap was stuck partially open.   She had very
&gt;similar symptoms.

The air flow sensor flap on my 944 sticks in a specific
position and causes the engine to sputter and if I take
my foot off the accelerator, it dies. I opened up the
air flow meter and watched it stick..not while driving
of course. I can get around this temporarily by revving
the engine which causes the flap to open up quickly and
then close quickly through the spot where it binds.
You may want to try quickly revving the engine and see
what happens. A new air flow meter for my 944 currently
is $500. I can get it rebuilt in 4 weeks for $250.
