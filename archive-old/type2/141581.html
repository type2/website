Subject: Re: [T2] Tanny mount sealing rings

Mike said:


 In the process of de-gunking the trans out of my 72, I dislodged some nylon looking rings. They came from the
sleeves that the trans carrier bolts go through. According to Bentley, ch.6 p.12, Fig 4.1 #5, they are sealing
rings. What exactly are they supposed to seal? How critical are they? Does anyone out there happen to know a
part number for said rings?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well...... that pic in Bentley does not resemble the pic in ETKA.
ETKA shows no seal rings.
Bentley shows 2 bushings..... ?!?!
ETKA shows 4 bushings. Part # 211 599 435 A
From vin 2x2 2000 001

The Bentley pic appears in the 68-72 parts book.
The seal rings are part # 211 599 437  qty 4
The bushings are # 211 599 435   qty 2
Both #'s from vin 2x2 2000 001  [72 yr model]

This means that the 4 211 599 435 A bushings replace the 2 435 bushings and the 4 437 seals.

Only the 435 A appears to be available at one dealer, and they only have 1!!
