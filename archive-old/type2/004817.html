Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel line question

The 7 x 3 gives you the size in i.d. and wall thickness. But 7 is too small.
Should be 7.5
I don't know what the other numbers are. Mercedes puts almost the same code on
their hoses, but they also put the MB part # on. So it is easy for me find out
what the hose is made for.

What is the problem with the ignition?

From: &quot;H Steven Dolan&quot; &lt;dworkin_at_pon.type2_dot_com&gt;

&gt; Volks,
&gt;
&gt; I am playing with the vanagon trying to clear up some problems in the
&gt; electronic ignition (more on that later) when I notice the FI hose at the
&gt; cold start valve is wet all of a sudden.  I am certain it was dry when I
&gt; started.  Drat!  Must have bumped it or something.  I want to replace it
&gt; so I go looking thru my bundle of spare hoses and see nothing that says
&gt; flat out &quot;this is FI rated&quot;  I do see a length of something that *looks*
&gt; FI rated, but won't put it in 'til I am sure.
&gt;
&gt; The markings on this length of hose are:
&gt;
&gt; VW TL 5225 E 7x3 K DK 3/41/96 VRT
&gt;
&gt; &gt;NBR&lt; &gt;CR&lt;
&gt;
&gt; These repeat on opposite sides of the hose.  Can someone out there confirm
&gt; that this is FI rated?  or NOT FI rated?  I would head for the store, but
&gt; it's Sunday morning and the only store that is a walk will have only
&gt; '5/16&quot; and 7/16&quot; oh, sure it's FI'  hose.
