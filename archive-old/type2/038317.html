Subject: Green light on the saga continues

Today I pulled out the oil pressure sensor. My brother turned the key while
I watched in dismay as no oil spurted out the hole and when I held my finger
over the hole I couldn't feel any pressure. : (  Looks like easter weekend
will be the beginning of a  rebuild. I live in Vancouver BC CANADA and there
are a few shops where I can get a new case,piston cylinder kit etc.. I would
be willing to order parts from somewhere in a far off land(the US) if they
are cheaper. On the other hand I would like to get started as quickly as
possible. Any comments?
