I was bonepicking in my local VW wreaking yard when I noticed that the 
yard manager (Shaun) had a &quot;for sale&quot; board mounted in the office.  This 
is his own vehicle.  Here's what the posting said:

SINGLE CAB
1968 Single Cab
Little rust
No Motor
Needs some brake parts
Looks nice, no belly rust

$1,200 OBO.

Ask for Shaun _at_ Bud's Bugs.

The picture of the vehicle (driver's side) looked pretty clean.

Now you know as much as I do.  The phone number is 925-825-8338.

Usual disclaimers apply.
