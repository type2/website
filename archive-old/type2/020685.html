How about we all just deal with what's going on? Ken's right. You can 
tell because I write to the list, and if you sold my words for $20 a 
disk, I'd be all over you.

I love the list, and I love the site. I see what you have to deal with. 
Now see what I have to deal with. I got 40 messages today. 18 of which 
were solely about this topic, and not bus related. That is incredible, 
and sad. This issue is so over. Let it be, man. - dave -
