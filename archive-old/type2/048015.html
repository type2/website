Subject: [T2] Dual Relay Ignorance shining through

Hi volks,

Well, I have been attempting to replace the dual relay switch and this is 
where my ignorance shines through when it comes to my new bus.

I am under the impression that the dual relay switch is the little light 
blue box on the rear of the fire wall.  I just tried to buy a replacement 
for it at the closest auto parts store, that being checker, and they had 
nothing.  I gave them both numbers from the front of the box and still 
nothing.  I looked through the book of switches and relays and found nothing 
that looks like what I need.  Is this a part that I need to order from a 
special VW place.  Mine has the VW symbol on it and it says made in germany. 
  I would like to put a new one of those on it.  Where do I need to go to 
find a replacement?

Also, while in the checker parking lot, you know the wisdom that unfolds in 
those parking lots is plentiful, a fellow VW guy that happened by said that 
the dual relay switch shouldn't be the cause of my problem.  he said it 
didn't heat up as it was a plastic box.  Now the ICU next to the dual relay 
switch on the rear wall, could heat up.  However, I have a new one and I am 
thinking that I need to just take it off and put some more heat sink onto 
the back of it and throw it back on.  My bus is running fine aside from that 
I am afraid to drive it anywhere for fear that it will die on me again.

My  problem again is that I am driving fine and then all of a sudden after a 
few hours of driving, the RPMs drop and the engine won't start.  It turns 
over but won't start.  When it dies there is no sputtering, no signs of 
overheating on my gauges and after sitting overnight it starts up fine.  
Someone said to &quot;throw some point back in&quot; and I am guessing that by &quot;point&quot; 
they mean put some more heat sink on the back of the ICU.

Sorry to pester the list with my mechanical ignorance.  What I wouldn't 
trade for the mind of one you guys that has rebuilt six or seven engines and 
knows them inside and out.
