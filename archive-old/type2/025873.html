&gt; Symptoms (hmmm?): always starts immediately and idles high if cold - choke
&gt; working fine,
&gt; 
&gt; if you let it sit for a few minutes starts immediately when warm and idles
&gt; fine at regular low idle speed - for about 30 seconds! then dies, subsequent
&gt; immediate starts have the smae problem - until you let it sit for a few
&gt; minutes - then if idles fine
&gt; 
&gt; the only way to get it to idle and not stall is either revving the engine OR
&gt; (INTERESTING PART HERE!) barely tap the accelerator OR back at the carb
&gt; barely jiggle (a couple millimeters, just barely or more) on the thrott

Is the carb on the manifold tight (don't forget the bolt at the front of the
flange)? How about the gasket?
