&gt; Has anyone bought a bus without seeing it? Any tips on how to
&gt; handle the transaction as far as money and title or checking out 
&gt; the vehicle are concerned.

I bought a bus unseen... well, i saw a couple of pictures first over the 
net.  Looks like you're in the UK, so I'm not sure how valuable any of 
my bureaucratic tips are, but here goes anyway:

I found the bus (a 1980 vanagon L Westfalia) on some VW website, for 
sale, $4000.  I was in NY at the time, planning on heading to San 
Francisco.  The bus was in Indiana.  I called the guy, asked him every 
question I could think of, and got him down to $3000.  I had him take it 
to the local VW shop (Klaus Autoworks in Indianapolis), where they did 
every check imaginable, and gave it a clean bill of health.  Of course, 
they could have been BSing me, but everybody seemed trustworthy.

A friend drove me to IN.  I arrived at the autoshop where the bus was 
waiting pending my paying for her various checkups.  When I saw her, I 
said &quot;where's my bus?&quot; The bus didn't look right at all.  The web 
pictures showed her as a robust dark blue.  This actual color could be 
described as either &quot;sky&quot; or &quot;baby blue&quot;.  I didn't like the color at 
all.  I swear the seller altered the color balance in photoshop before 
posting the pictures to the web.

But anyway, who cares, I was getting a good bus for $3000, which is way 
less than it would have cost in San Francisco.  I got an Indiana 
driver's licence (which was semi easy:  all I had to do was write down 
an IN address), Indiana insurance ($300/year), and that was it.  I've 
now driven her 10,000 miles in 5 months absolutely without incident.  
Been living in her ever since I got the title.

Just my experience. 

(While I was traveling around the country I posted the good parts from 
all my emails to my site, so if you feel like seeing a more thorough 
travelogue, head to wrybread_dot_com/WryRoad/, and follow the link to

(sorry if this email has weird hard returns in it - I'm at work and 
using Hotmail, which does that for some reason)
