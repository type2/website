Subject: [T2] Clutch Problems

I'm sorry. Kick me off the list. I can't help myself.

After a clutch made nests in my motor compartment, I clutched some tools out 
of a clutch, removed the motor, and clutched the clutch. It wobbled a bit, 
but I stabilized it in a clutch situation. Now I have no more clutch 
problems.
