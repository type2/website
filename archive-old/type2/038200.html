Subject: Timing and Dist. Question

'Morning Folks,
     Here it is 24 hours befor my planned departure to Everybus, and my '76 
with the carbed 1.8L is running like crap. I have played with the timing, 
every which way possible, and while it will run OK for a while, the missing 
and hesitation comes back. Last night I noticed I can still turn the 
distributor even with the hold down clamp tightened as far as it will go. 
This engine has never run well around town, but always ran smoothly at 
highway speeds-now it won't even do that. I'm also running a Pertronix 
Ignitor, so no points. I also played with the carb a little last night, but 
that only seemed to make it worse. Also noticed some cracks in the manifold 
boots, even though they were replaced less than two years ago, so I imagine a 
vacuum leak could also be the problem. But being able to move the dist. when 
it's tightened down bothers me. Any one got any suggestions? Instead of 
spending the last 3 months on body work, I should have been putting in the 
2.0L FI engine I've got, but it's a little late for that now!
