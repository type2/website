Subject: Replacing spring in accelerator pedal???

I don't want to start this without a word from the wise. 
Is there any tricks to replacing the spring on the 
accelerator pedal? '74 Westfalia. Do I just hammer the pin 
out and it's self explanatory? I just want to be sure 
before I start. My luck is that I will remove the old 
spring and the new one has a trick to install it right.

Thanks!  Justin

.....I'm still chuckling about how ric got me bigtime!!
