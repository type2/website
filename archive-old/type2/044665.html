philip-
in order to save that new seal, you can use WD-40.
open the seal with a plastic bondo spreader or putty knife
and liberally squirt both sides . wipe the glass and use
rubber gloves for traction. gently apply pressure across the top
and have a helper ready to catch the panel. the key here is patience.
otherwise, go to the glass installers. since it is a cheap seal,
what will you be saving if you crack the panel ?
