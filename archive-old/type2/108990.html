Subject: FS in Fresno, Calif

Last week at the Classic, I noticed bay window prices were ridiculously over-priced..... well, I guess others
in Fresno think the prices are too cheap here. In todays Fresno Bee:

VW  1970 bus, must see! Too much to list. $4000 OBO 559-897-0169

Now you know as much as I do......
