Subject: Poptop replacement-my method worked!

Just finished putting on Bus Depot's tan 3 windowed poptop canvas
on my 78 Westy- it has the black welting on the top.  Found it to be
rather tight, and is too short to allow the top edge to fold over the
plastic stapling strips, stapled so they are not seen from inside or
outside.  Easiest way to remove the original was to put a chisel or
screwdriver under the entire strip, and it comes off with the staples
still in it.  Lay it over a gap and just tap them down with a hammer and
pull with pliers.
   Used my original idea of fastening the bottom first, starting with
the front center metal strip, using an icepick through the strip to find
the screw holes in the bus top.  Cut V's into the lower beading to allow
the tight turn.  Had to stretch the straight run a bit to make it come
out in the rear.  Make sure the &quot;center&quot; comes out in the middle of the
rear.  BTW, I removed the bed-fold-over section and the mats, allowing
for better clearance to lie back there and work on the screws!
Used a 2x4 to hold up the top just behind the handle when removing the
arms from the TOP connection (2 bolts each side; have welded nuts to
make reattachment easy). Tie the arms in a closed position before you
raise the top all the way to work in the rear, and they won't scratch
the top &quot;fuzz&quot; (ask me how I know!)  These arms would get in the way of
my stapling the top of the canvas, but the top must be extended to the
right height on each side to do this accurately, so I cut two boards the
exact length of the extended arms and propped them between the top
corners and rested them in front of the bottom arm hinge, tying them to
the hinge so they couldn't slip off.
     Did lots of stapling, and had to stretch it quite a bit to allow
the rear to come out stapled all around.  I used 3/8&quot; stainless staples,
the longest Home Depot has for the Arrow electric stapler.  I feel these
are too short to use through the plastic strip also.  My method works
fine, but will be a PITA whenever replacing this top in the future (not
in MY LIFETIME), for all staples then would have to be pulled in situ. 
The staples (viewable if you lie on top) I will cover with a decorative
strip from a fabric store.
