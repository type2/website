I think you may have found my problem.  The starter turns over and I know
the battery is good, but nothing on the dash works(the idiot lights don't
come on and the gas guage doesn't respond).

I was driving when this happened.  I pulled out from a stop, made it to
2nd gear and then it died.

How do I test the ignition?  By checking voltage at  the starter?  The
starter turns over and the head lights work(when key is 'on') so obviously
something in there is wtill operating.

Thanks,
Craig
