I want to say a big Thank You to the list and especially Karl for the 
responce to my quest for a special oil breather box that I needed for the 
engine that is going into my '73 Sunroof.  It comes on 914 and 411 engines 
and has the oil filler spout on the top of the breather box.  I asked on 
Saturday, and Karl found one and got it in the mail and I had it today.  And 
several Volks were kind enough to point out a couple of junkyards in my local 
area, and others told me that it was used on the 914, as I only knew that it 
was on the 411 engine.

So THANKS to you all and especially Karl.... Bus folks have a sense of 
community that is hard to beat... Next year, it is EveryBus and BBB for 
sure.... somehow, I will get time off from work and meet as many of you as I 
can.... This list is the most valuable tool I know of for working on my Bus.
