Hi all,
Yesterday I became the proud owner of a Bentley Service Manual - Station
Wagon 68-79.  It will go very nicely with me new '72 Westy.  The best
part, I only paid $10.50 for it (the manual, not the bus) and it's in
very good condition.  All the pages/wiring diagrams.  E-bay is our
friend.
BTW - There are still 3 or 4 manuals (separate auctions) for the 68 -78
or 79 going on E-bay right now.  What are the differences in these
manuals?  I've seen 68-78 and 68-79.  Not to mention different markings
in the lower right hand corner of the front cover, some say Robert
Bentley (like mine) and the newer ones also have the price of $34.95
there as well.  Are there major differences in these manuals?

Thanks all,
-Paul
-'72 Westy
