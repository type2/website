Subject: Re: [T2] Cal smog laws, was Reattaching the panel vinyl.

&gt; By the way, the 78 bus runs good, I have to take it in for a smog test this
&gt; weekend. Hopefully it will pass.  Since it is a 78, I only have one more
&gt; year in California until the bus is 25 years old, then I will not have to
&gt; smog it again.

In California, at the moment, its 1973 and older vehicles.
http://www.dmv_dot_ca_dot_gov/vr/smogfaq.htm

Currently, there are several types of vehicles that are exempt from
Smog Check: motorcycles, diesel-powered vehicles, all 1973 and older vehicles,
vehicles four model-years old and newer, as well as non-combustion engine
vehicles. SB 42 (Kopp), enacted in 1997 (Chapter 801), exempted 1966-1973
vehicles from the Smog Check program and created the 30-year rolling exemption
that will take effect in 2003. The 30-year rolling exemption will exempt
post-1973 vehicles from Smog Check when each model year
becomes 30 years old. Thus, in 2003, vehicle model year 1974 will be exempt.
In 2004, vehicle model year 1975 will be exempt, and so on. Prior to SB 42,
only pre-1966 vehicles were exempted from the program.

[Koop tried to get it passed 1st with a 25 year rolling drop-off but it
failed. He had to rewrite it to 30 years with a 5 year moratorium on 1973
vehicles and then the 30 year rolling drop-off went into effect.]

Here is SB42:
http://leginfo.public_dot_ca_dot_gov/pub/97-98/bill/sen/sb_0001-0050/sb_42_bill_199710
09_chaptered.html

There was a bill introduced to drop the 30 year rolling drop-off.  This can be
read in its entirely at
http://www_dot_calepa_dot_ca_dot_gov/Legislation/2001/SB1172.htm
But a search for SB1172 does not show it worded as above! It only pertains to
a Utility Co. and Gov. Davis vetoed it on 10/14/01.

Same author, Kuehl, but not the same subject.... our tax dollars at work
again....
