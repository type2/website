&gt; &gt;But for a small population segment, the aura of T2
&gt; &gt;ownership is, is... I guess I can't put it in writing.
&gt; &gt; Can one say I &quot;love&quot; my T2?  Is that appropriate?
&gt; &gt;Accurate?
&gt;
&gt; Love could be the appropriate word.  I know from the experience that having
&gt; a pre-owned tuna can is not a stress free relationship.  Nor is it cheap for
&gt; that matter.  But, those times involved with our bus (whether good or bad)
&gt; always seem to be more memorable and leave a longer lasting, heartfelt

yeah,, memorable is the right word, or maybe )_at_*&amp;_at__at_!_at_#*$)!!!!
   spent past two weeks getting ready for winter, had put all new heavy
duty wiring to/from batteries, cleaned up some metal that was looking a
little rust eary.  finally got around to pulling the exhaust header and
fixing that stuborn leak. was looking and sounding mighty nice.  went
skiing today, nice (cold) drive up to the local (70miles) ski slope got in
a few runs nice, go back to the van and cranks then stops!!  nada?!
  starter motor crapped out...this is an automatic, no starter, no start.
turned on ignition crawled under in the snow, whacked and shorted and
finally got her to spin a little and J.O.A.T, fired on the first
cyl....drove home without turning off engine, pull in behind house it is 9
degrees out and when I turn it off, nothing..selonoid clicks but that is
it......mumble mumble mumble.._dot_call Bus Depot &quot;How fast can you get a
Bosch reman starter here...paying &quot;expidited&quot; freight for a HEAVY starter
motor....gotta get her fixed by weekend as I'm going away to a weeklong
clinic where I and other instructors teach about 100 disabled kids how to
ski!!  been doing this for years and it is a high point of the winter but
it is a 5 hour drive.   (makes it special also because this is the clinic
where I learned how to ski many years ago)  sooooo looks like a VERY cold
starter swap behind the house in hopefully 30 degree weather.   sheesh!!

nuff kevetching time to go remember all the great trips she's hauled me
into and out of the mountains...

Bob
