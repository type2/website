Subject: looking for 228mm flywheel

That would be the flywheel from a '76 or later model bus or vanagon. 
If interested, I would also trade it for the scarcer 215 mm ('74 and
'75 only) flywheel that is currently installed. 

(The reason for the flywheel swap is that I need to install the
bellhousing of a '76+ bus to be able to eventually drop in the 911
engine with the 9&quot; KEP clutch kit--the Porsche conversion, however, is
postponed until I get my own garage. With the 228mm flywheel, I could
get KEP's clutch kit now.)

Thanks,

Sami
