Subject: engine stand for sale

Well, I bought one (engine stand) thinking I would need it.  I don't.  The 
store won't let me return it cause it's a &quot;tool&quot;.  I have put it together 
and taken it apart, that's it! Brand new retail $100 cdn engine stand and I 
dont want it.

Anyhow, if anyone could use it, please pmail me.  I'd love $50 cdn for it, 
but if you've got a story i'd probably just give it to you or something.  
I'll deliver to almost anywhere in Southwest BC / Washington if need be.

Peace Volks,
- Ian
