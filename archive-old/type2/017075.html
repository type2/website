Greetings,

I'm not a Type2 subscriber, nor do I have an air cooled bus.  I'm trying to
assemble parts to install a 1.9 liter TDI diesel into my Vanagon Westy with an
as-yet-not-located 5-speed trans.  In my searches looking for this, I
encountered what appears to be a really good deal.  But it's applicable to your
vehicles rather than to my project, if I understand things correctly.  So I'm
posting the following for any of you to follow as you may see fit.  Should you
ever encounter a 5-speed, it surely would be nice to hear about it by telling
me at LvLearn_at_cwix_dot_com   The following content is from e-mail correspondence:

Re: VW Bus Transmission
FROM: HONDA81_at_aol_dot_com

 John, thank you for your reply.  I am an X VW mechanic, having worked on many
air cooled Beetles and Buses.  I changed my career in 1976.  I continued to
repair and restore Bugs and Buses for family and friends until (snip) in 82.
When I sold my home I had to literally trash (believe it or not) a school bus
load of very good body and mechanical parts.  It really broke my heart.
However, I managed to keep some stuff.  This transmission is part of that
stuff.  I don't believe I will have a need for it as it is quite difficult to
find these vehicles that are not rusty.
  I bought and drove home the wrecked 71 bus that the trans was in.  It was hit
pretty good across the front but really only needed a front nose panel.  I
thought about fixing it but with having to get rid of all my STUFF decided to
strip it.  Having driven the Bus I knew that the trans was in great shape and
with the miles being at 70K I just had to grab it.  So, I have had this trans
out of the Bus in storage for oh about 15 years.
  Now your questions.  Yes, first gear is synchronized. I do not know the drive
ratios.  I only have the trans and do not have axles, shift linkage, clutch
pedal etc.  I kept other stuff like starters generators and air cooled engine
parts.  I would like to sell it all and actually have to go through the stuff
to find out exactly what I have.
    Anyway, I live in Hatboro, Pa. 19040 zip code.  I have to weigh it and will
get back to you with that information.  I can try to find out what the best way
to ship is when I return to work on Monday.
Best regards,
Evan Stevens
******copy from second note******
If you still have any interrest in the transmission it weighs about 85 lbs.  I
can find out the best way to ship if you are interrested. Let me know either
way.  I am curious as to how your project is going.
******copy from latest note******
      I appreciate your wanting to hook me up with a buyer if you are not
interrested.  Looking forward to hearing from you.  Evan

Look Volks, Evan seems to be a nice guy and a straight shooter.  He's only
asking $180 for it.  You have his e-mail address above.  And if you want to
thank me, just be fair to him and keep an eye out for a 5-speed for that crazy
diesel nut named
John
peace
Help each other.  If we don't, who will?
