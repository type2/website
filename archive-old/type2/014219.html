Hey List,
I see, my mistake. I guess I know now. Sorry about the
misinformation and waste of bandwith. There I go
again, opening my mouth with out checking first.:0)

Have a great day!

&gt; No, the production year runs from August to July.
&gt; i.e August 73 would be a 74. Anything built to about
&gt; the end of July 74 would be
&gt; a 74. 2/74 is a 74.

&gt; &gt; Hello Eddie,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I may be mistaken but if the date that is on the
&gt; plate
&gt; &gt; behind the driver's seat says 2/74 that means it
&gt; was
&gt; &gt; produced in 2/74 which makes your bus is a 75 year
&gt; &gt; model. I may be wrong but if you think of, say, a
&gt; 2001
&gt; &gt; year model car, it first came out on the market in
&gt; &gt; 2000. I could be mistaken, but that is what I
&gt; thought.
&gt; &gt; Good luck with your Tranny! If I am mistaken,
&gt; someone
&gt; &gt; please correct me. Thanks!
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt;  I switched transmissions today and some things
&gt; came
&gt; &gt; &gt; to my surprise. My
&gt; &gt; &gt; intent was to replace what I thought to be the
&gt; &gt; &gt; original gearbox in my '74
&gt; &gt; &gt; Westy with one that I got from a '73 bus with
&gt; only
&gt; &gt; &gt; 92,000 orig miles. (The
&gt; &gt; &gt; bus was from Nantucket, you can't really drive
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; far there, only in
&gt; &gt; &gt; circles :) for $150 from the local vw guy. After
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; few hours of pain I had
&gt; &gt; &gt; the transmissions side by side. The one that I
&gt; took
&gt; &gt; &gt; out was a 5 rib
&gt; &gt; &gt; tranny(!). I thought these were only used in
&gt; '75.I
&gt; &gt; &gt; had never really
&gt; &gt; &gt; given it much notice other than the 002 marking.
&gt; My
&gt; &gt; &gt; bus is dated
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2/74. Did they put 5 rib tranny's into any
&gt; busses
&gt; &gt; &gt; previous to 1975, or is
&gt; &gt; &gt; this not the first transmission that this bus
&gt; has
&gt; &gt; &gt; seen?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;  There were also a few other differences with
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; transmissions. The
&gt; &gt; &gt; 5 rib, 002 tranny i took out had
&gt; &gt; &gt; the ground strap on the driver's side and the
&gt; '73
&gt; &gt; &gt; was on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; opposite. The bus was meant to have it connect
&gt; on
&gt; &gt; &gt; the drivers side, I will
&gt; &gt; &gt; need to make a modification when I am finished
&gt; &gt; &gt; installing the '73
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;  Also There is some kind of sender switch
&gt; screwed
&gt; &gt; &gt; into the very
&gt; &gt; &gt; rear of the '73 tranny (its not the back up
&gt; light
&gt; &gt; &gt; switch, this one is on
&gt; &gt; &gt; the very rear, up and right of the gear shift
&gt; lever)
&gt; &gt; &gt; It is 2 prong and has
&gt; &gt; &gt; a wire on one prong connecting to the same bolt
&gt; as
&gt; &gt; &gt; the ground
&gt; &gt; &gt; strap, obviously a ground connection. The 5 rib
&gt; &gt; &gt; tranny did not have
&gt; &gt; &gt; this. What is it?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Some background info that might be useful:
&gt; &gt; &gt;  it is definately a '74 bus, VIN is '74, door
&gt; date
&gt; &gt; &gt; is 2/74 and there were
&gt; &gt; &gt; no provisions for fuel injection when i got it.
&gt; It
&gt; &gt; &gt; does now though. Got it
&gt; &gt; &gt; with no engine and installed a '75 1800 with all
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; fuel injection. The
&gt; &gt; &gt; odmeter reads 10,500. This could be 310,500 or
&gt; even
&gt; &gt; &gt; more. All I know is
&gt; &gt; &gt; that in 1985 it had 185,000. The transmission
&gt; that i
&gt; &gt; &gt; took out was very
&gt; &gt; &gt; worn. It was leaking pretty bad, made some awful
&gt; &gt; &gt; grinding noises and
&gt; &gt; &gt; didn't like to downshift into 2nd.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; When I finish with my CV joints (after my axle
&gt; &gt; &gt; mishap) tomorrow she will
&gt; &gt; &gt; be with a nice '73 transmission from Nantucket
&gt; :)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; thanks
