Hey Volks...I'm in need of a new engine for
my 76 Westy. I searched the internet but only 
came across a few sites who sell them and those
were fuel injected. I prefer to get an engine with
a carberator. Does anybody have a clue where I can get a *NEW* Engine
with a carberator(not fuel injected)
for my 76? Any help is appreciated. Thanks!!! Please
email me directly.

Peace and Love,

Greg
