Subject: clutch cable adjust

Greetings...

It's been a while..

Quick question on my clutch cable adjustment.  When the clutch is out (pedal
not depressed) the engine idles at a lower speed than when the clutch is in
(pedal depressed).  My take on this seems to be that I need to tighten the
wingnut to pull the clutch disc away from the flywheel. Is this correct or
is the clutch too tight right now in which case I need to loosen the
adjusting wingnut (seems unlikely)?

Bus shifts fine right now, but I'm worried that I'm wearing my clutch disc
at a much higher rate than I need to.  It also makes idle adjustment
inaccurate..

Cheers,
