Subject: [T2] piston weights

&gt;So, I weighed a spare replacement piston ....
&gt;and it was 1.2 ouces lighter than my others.
&gt; Is that going to make a big difference?

Matched piston weight makes a balanced engine.
Find a piston closer to spec. You can't add weight.
It is possible to remove 1 oz. from the other three
but it's a lot and if you have done it before, you will
understand it requires skill just to find where to cut
and not lose structural integrity. You won't be happy.
Better to get the new set now, save the labor of a redo.
