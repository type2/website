Subject: Re: [T2] fan hub spacer removal

So I am depressed because I really don't want to have to get a 
three arm puller to get that stupid thing off.  I tell my girlfriend
about Bill's solution, and then I sit around depressed.

Ten minutes later she comes up and handed me three pennies.  She says
&quot;It only costed three cents to get that thing off.&quot;  I turned over
the pennies and see this:

Thanks Bill and Tia,

&gt;  I'm guessing it is some kind of circlip thing, but I am not able to
&gt; remove it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; Best way to get it off is by using three bolts through the threaded ears
&gt; pressing against somw 1/8&quot; steel blocks resting on the case / seal area.
&gt; Makes removal simple. Don't forget to remove the center bolt and washer.
