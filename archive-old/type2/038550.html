Trying this again...sloppy editing on my part caused it to get slapped by

&gt; you don't need to take the tranny completely out it even flexes at the
&gt; nose enough   YMMV

--&gt; Careful.  My '75 van came with a cracked nose mount and a bent shift
rod.  It's my best guess that these resulted from someone letting the
transmission drop too far at the rear.  (Straightening the shift rod did
wonders for my shift pattern.)
