Let me tell you about those Canadian roads. 'Round here the deer lay in wait
in the culverts. Your lights pick em up at the last minute and you silently
say, stay bambi, stay. Wont even mention the Elk and Bear X-ings. Well at
least the bears have sense enough to run in the opposite direction.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't want to alarm you, but hit a cow at any speed, with or without
&gt; &gt; &gt; that spare tire on the nose of whatever, and the result will be the
big
&gt; &gt; &gt; hurt !!
&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps that spare prevented that moo-cow from laying in your lap, at
&gt; &gt; &gt; impact !!!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yes- before this incident I was under the impression that living bodies
&gt; &gt; would make for rather elastic collisions,
&gt;
&gt; The last thing that you want is an elastic collision!  If something
&gt; bounces off the front of the bus it will impart even more momentum change
&gt; to the bus and you.
&gt;
&gt; but noooo. Apparently deer also
&gt; &gt; routinely total cars, though they must weigh hundreds of pounds less
than
&gt; &gt; cows on average.
&gt;
&gt; Accelerating any multi-hundred pound object from 0 to the speed you are
&gt; going in a few inches will cause incredible forces.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; And I've heard that those unfortunate enough to hit a
&gt; &gt; moose really have a hard time, partly because moose are so tall and
&gt; &gt; they tend to come in through the windshield even on big tall trucks.
Owie.
&gt;
&gt; Something I pondered seriously as I drove along Canadian roads with forest
&gt; growing right up to the edge of the road.  On a motorcycle.  Someone told
&gt; me that moose can even run through thick woods despite their racks.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; BTW, the cow in question was a juvenile, maybe 1 year old.
&gt;
&gt; A few miles north of the place where I hit the deer we had met (the year
&gt; before) a fellow in a pickup that had hit a yearling steer with his F-350
&gt; F*rd truck with a very hefty full-width grillguard,  The impact had bent
&gt; the frame and shoved the grillguard into the grill, as well as wiping out
&gt; the radiator.  Coolent, transmission fluid, and diesel fuel were all
&gt; running onto the ground.
&gt;
&gt; Be careful out there!
