Subject:  [T2] installing a new canvas - any tips

	Has anyone ever done said R&amp;R but added a zipper to the upper and
lower circumference of the top?  Done with GoreTex or a heavy Dernier
polyester canvas, this would surely make future removal, and/or cleanings an
easier job.


todd. sends:

&gt; good idea to repaint, are you able to do that yourself or do you have
&gt; to take it somewhere. Where can i take it if I wanted someone else to
&gt; do it?

Most any autobody shop or boat repair shop can paint fiberglass. Find one
that works on a lot of Corvettes if you want a great job and you're really
into spending money.

Or you can paint it yourself if you know how to paint cars; tell the guy at
the paint counter you're painting fiberglass and you'll get the proper
primer.
