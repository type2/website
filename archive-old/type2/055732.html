&gt;i have a 74 bus with a 69-71 or so layout in it. i have the suicide
&gt;closet on the right side of the car next to the fold out bench/bed. with
&gt;one rear facing seat on the driver side, and the sink/water/icebox on
&gt;the passenger side, i am considering extending the rear facing seat  (it
&gt;would be permenent) to accomodate another passenger. this would:
&gt;
&gt;1- add room for another passenger while in transit
&gt;2- add more storage space for trips
&gt;3- close off any access to the front of the bus (i guess like the 60's
&gt;non walkthroughs)
&gt;4 -allow me to buy or build a centre console in between the two front
&gt;seats. for storage, CD's, cup holders, etc ,etc
&gt;
&gt;has anyone else thought of this? anyone else done this? any ideas or
&gt;thoughts - pro or con on my idea?

Well, for a less permanent solution, there is a stool that fits in between
the rear facing seat and the icebox, and straps to the bracket on the side
of the icebox.  It's the same height as the rear facing seat and would
accomodate another passenger (though it doesn't have a back).  You could
maybe make your center console with a back, though.  If it were me, I'd
see how I liked having the stool always installed there before I decided
to do something more permanent.  I think I'd get tired of not being able
to walk from the driver's seat to the back without exiting and coming in
the sliding door.
