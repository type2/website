I have a 73 Hanover Conversion in excellent shape purchased from the original owner. There is a large and comfortable cot that roll out on the drivers side when the top is up and it had a original bench seat in back that folded out like a sofa bed . I have removed this and installed the interior from a 73 westy. The straight up pop top is very roomy and does not leak. there are two roof vents on the pop top.  From what the original owner tells me the company that made them in Surrey B.C.
Canada in long out of business.  Keep on truckin ,  Eric
