Pulled the blown 1.8 out of my 74 yesterday and found some interestine
results.

The #1 piston has a gouge in the top.
The #3 dropped a valve.
The #4 has a HUGE hole burnt right through it.
Not a pretty sight!

Questions are:
Oil cooler, should I clean and re-use or replace?

Push-rods and tubes, re-use or replace?

Any other re-assembly tips or pointers?  This is the first time I have
ever removed or tore down anything mechanical so assume I am stupid and
please pass along the things that you think everyone should already know.

Thanks,
Ed Maikranz
