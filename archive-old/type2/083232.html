&gt; FRS radios.
&gt;
&gt; If you need a caravan radio or a radio to call back your little Indians for
&gt; dinner on a camping trip I recommend these radios. There are fancy and
&gt; plain varieties. The fancy ones will scramble the audio and electronically
&gt; minimize interference. The plain variety we have has 6 custom tones or
&gt; jingles when you are trying to get the person on the other end to sit up
&gt; and take notice that you're calling. Automatic squelch with a 1 button
&gt; override. 14 channels. Earplug or headphones jack. The fancy versions even
&gt; have digital scrambling and voice activated transmit with a headphone/mic
&gt; combo.
&gt;
&gt; And some are cheap - the Bellsouth versions I saw at the local
&gt; super-hardware store are less than $20 each and the Motorolas are about
&gt; $50-$60 a pair for the basic ones.

Wallyworld has basic Unidens for $10 each.  The only bad FRS radios I've
come across were from BellSouth.  I really like the Uniden Ecotrek $10
specials I bought,  Easy to operate, no bells or whistles to screw up, and
a very handy carabiner clip to hang them from things.

&gt; Lastly - do any of you know what frequency these radios operate on? I've
&gt; got a scanner and like to know stuff like that. And finally - do different
&gt; brands of FRS radios communicate or are they brand specific - do you have
&gt; to have two of the same brands to communicate?

They are in the 460MHz region.  If you google on &quot;frequency&quot; and &quot;FRS&quot;
you'll probably find the exact numbers.
&gt;
&gt; Don't think I will give up my CB though b/c the truckers who offer valuable
&gt; road conditions and cultural insight don't use FRS radios.

No, and that's one of the nice things about FRS.  It does what CB was
intended to do in the first place, provide short-range reliable
communications.  It's been years since I've received any valuable
information from a trucker on a CB.
