Subject: [T2] Help with other vehicles...OTP

I'm in need of the type of help this list provides for VWs, for one of 
my non-VW vehicles.  It's a 92 T*Y*T*A pickup.  Anybody know of any 
lists for that vehicle?  I've got a mysterious clutch problem.

Bus content:  Last week, after not one but two of my non-VWs failed on 
the job, the bus came through with flying colors (and very little 
heat).  Had wake him up from hibernation, but he was rarin' to go.
