&gt; I don't get it. My 71 Westy shifts through the gears just fine - as long as

My guess would be a dry pilot bearing--the needle bearing that's inside the
gland nut holding on the flywheel.  Simple, but the engine has to come out to
check.  I've seen them so dry that the needles fall out in pieces.  When this
occurs the transmission can't disengage from the engine--you effectively have
no clutch.  The transmission input shaft will be pitted, scored and rusty
looking, but it can still be cleaned with a file and emery cloth and used.
Better to get a used German gland nut with a VW logo than a new Brazilian with
no logo.  Some mechanics don't think to put a little grease in there each time
they reinstall the engine.  Or on the tip of the input shaft if you don't
remember till after you've put the clutch on.
