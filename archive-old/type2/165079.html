Subject: Re: [T2] ridiculous engine pulling question

Having balanced a bug engine on a floor jack and R&amp;R'd the engine in
my bus with a motorcycle/ATV jack, I would strongly recommend the
motorcycle/ATV jack.  No balancing issues at all.  The platform on the
motorcycle/ATV jack is as big as the block and it's easy to adjust the
position of the engine on the jack.

I did the bug engine with help and was able to easily do the bus engine myself.
