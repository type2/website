Subject: 73?

Hey everyone...sorry is this is an obvious question. I have, what I
think to be, a 73 transporter. That's what I was told when I bought it
at least. According to the Muir book, they started putting that second
access point to the engine in the busses made since 73. My bus has
this access point, but the front of it is setup to take the large VW
logo rather than the smaller (10 inch?) one. From everything ELSE I
read....busses made since 73 were supposed to be setup for the smaller
logo.

Do I need to just get the chasis number and look it up somewhere
online? Do I have some magical hybrid.....or am I just confused with
my research?

Thanks,
Scott
