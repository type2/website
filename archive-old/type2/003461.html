Due to a recent health discovery, I will not be able
to restore the 1968 Double Cab that I just purchased. :(

I live in Indianapolis. If anyone is interested, pleae let me know.
There is a bit of body rot, and the engine is out, and ran fine when
removed, allegedly 5 years ago..., on my garage floor.

Also, have no title currently. There is also tow parts engines, and
other stuff....nothing major..

If anyone could help, please let me know. I could sure use the money, and
piece of mind
knowing that she is going to get a good home, and end up back on the road...

Subject: [T2] Oil Cooler Replacement


Hi Folks,

I've been struggling with excessively high oil temps recently, and have been
thinking about replacing my oil cooler.  I have a 1979 2.0L GE-series FI
engine, and live at 8,000ft elevation.  The current oil cooler is original,
and is probably not working very efficiently anymore (clogged with oil
inside, clogged with dirt outside).  I'm also considering adding an external
cooler as well...

So, does anybody know if the stock oil cooler can be replaced with the
engine still in the Bus?

Thanks for any help,
Jason Upper
