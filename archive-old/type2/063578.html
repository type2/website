Subject: Re: 81 brake master cylinder leak

I bought the replacement plugs for the master cylinder at the dealer today
for $4.10 ea. The part # is 357611817 and plug is the proper description.

This was about an hours job or less. Removed the instrument cluster and
siphoned out the fluid with a straw then stuck a towel in there to catch any
remaining fluid. I was scared of breaking the reservoir, which had been
mentioned as a risk, so I pried as smoothly as I could with the flat of a
wrench. The rear popped out and then the front followed easily. The plugs had
noticeably deteriorated in comparison to the new, reminded me of old faucet
washers. Only took one try to figure out that you fit the plugs to the
reservoir and then plug it into the mc, not vice versa. Cleaned up all I
could with paper towels including the steering column cover which first
catches any drips first.

I'm keeping newspaper on the floor partly to soak up fluid in the carpet and
partly to spot any new drips. Since this was so quick, easy, and cheap, I
naturally suspect that the plugs weren't the whole problem. How's that for
vanagon induced cynicism?

Thanks to all who helped.
