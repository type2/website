Yes, bug given the general underpowered nature of a bus... do people really
lug them?  I mean... you can move forward if you lug it :)

I did look into the Bosch rev limiting rotor...  I should have mentioned it.

The one thing I worry about most when lending out my bus is that someone
might lug the engine.  I have nightmares about that one!  So I don't lend my
bus out very often.  I'm not selfish, I just like my bus.
