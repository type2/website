&gt; Speaking of basic items....
&gt;
&gt; Back in December, I discovered, ordered and received a digital electronic
&gt; vernier caliper from Maryland Metrics for $31.85.  I thought the sale
&gt; ended on 01/01/02, but it has been extended to 03/31/02, so I want to
&gt; recommend this to all.

How can a caliper with a digital readout be a vernier caliper?  Does it
have a auxiliary vernier for when the battery dies?

I guess I like the old fashioned variety.  Kind of a entrance exam to the
trade!
