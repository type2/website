Subject: # Re: [T2] zerk fittings 

Golly, how can those two straight / rear facing zerk fittings on the front 
axle beam BREAK??

I mean, the two straight 8mm zerk fittings, one on each side of the front 
axle beam.  You know, right at the spot on the front axle beam where you 
usually set up your jack stands . . .   No, not the single 6mm zerk fitting 
at the center, facing front, where you usually jack the bus up, with blocks 
of wood that slip and all..

You know, you can simply plug those 8mm holes with a $0.05 8mm bolt, and no 
one will be wiser, not even the NO (New Owner).  I may have some extra 6mm 
bolts I can send, if I can find them.

PS&gt;  So I pulled the center zerk fitting and found it to be 6mm.  I ran 
around from shop to shop to find a replacement 6mm.  Little did I know that 
the side ones, the broken ones were 8mm.

Advanced Auto had a box of 8 for $4( I forget the sizes), and AutoZone had a 
box of 8 for $4; AutoZone had 2 - 6mm straight, 2 - 6mm angle, 2 - 8mm 
straight and 2 - 8mm angle, probably the way to go.  In my area of the 
world, Total Auto parts has the 8mm on a single basis, Small Car Parts and 
Olympic = da nada.
