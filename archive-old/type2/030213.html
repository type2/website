 Out of interest, is there anyone here who can say they were able to
prevent
damage to a stock engine, through the use of gauges, which would have
happened
otherwise? ie not &quot;I heard it pinking and noticed the oil pressure was
low&quot;
or &quot;I smelt hot oil and saw the CHT was rising&quot; but &quot;everything was going
perfectly and then the oil pressure started to drop. I pulled over and 
found that my engine was about to explode with no other indication!&quot;.

That would be me!!!  I have a full suite of gauges in the '80 and I firmly
believe that without them I'd have blown the engine right out of the '80.
The current engine really does not need them in normal circumstances, but
driving down I-5 in California where the air temp is 105+, I have to slow
down and the oil temp and pressure gauges tell me when and how much.
Back when I had the MSHP engine, they were *vital*!  after 20k+ miles, I
turned the engine over to John and there no dropped valves, in large part
because I never overheated the heads... per the CHT gauge.

On a stock engine in a normal environment, gauges are not necessary...
with a modified engine or in extreme environments, they can be very very
useful.
