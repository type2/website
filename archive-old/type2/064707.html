Subject: LEAF Fest: CO2 System needed (VW Stout)

hey now,

well, here i am again, looking to borrow a co2 kegging system so i can finally
test my Transporter Stout, aka Armenian Stout (aprox. 9.7% alcohol) that was
kegged in jan of this year. will be a little over 10 months. stout is perfect
for fall weather.

if anyone has a kegging system, PLEASE let me borrow or rent it from you on
the weekend of oct 18-20. better yet, come to the festival with us and enjoy
vws, music and homemade STOUT!
