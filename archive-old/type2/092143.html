Subject: Re: [T2] 76 Westy starts and dies

How many do you want?

&lt;www.mcmaster_dot_com&gt; part number 3846K6 $7.24.
Hose barb, $.95 from NAPA (bought one this afternoon.)
1/4&quot; fuel hose, $.72/ft.
hose clamp, another $.75,
fancy pasteboard box and blow-molded insert, $50.
Total cost, $60. ;o)

(We're talking a piece of test equipment here.  It's not going to be a
permanent installation. Based on my experience, it'll get used about 
once a year. Maybe less often. They're cheap enough, that at my house, 
each bus has it's own. Except the Diesel, but only because NAPA hasn't 
got the 3,000 psig gauge in stock.)

 &gt; The carb fuel pressure testers are in the $15 range, and go from 0-10PSI
 &gt; The FI fuel pressure testers are a different beast and are far pricier,
 &gt; but cover 0-60/100 psi.  I have seen them on sale for as cheap as 
$40, but
 &gt; I would expect to pay $50-60 on an average day.  If you can find an FI
 &gt; gauge for $15, tho... let me know!!!!
