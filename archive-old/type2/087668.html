Subject: '78 Can't get idle going fast enough

Hi All,

For those of you following my adventures, I just got a new AVP engine and =
I have been getting things put back together and normal.=20

I've tried opening up the idle adjust screw on my '78. I can make the =
engine go fast enough not to stall (I'm guessing 600 RPM or something), =
but not anything close to normal and I have the idle screw backed out much =
further than I think is normal.

Timing is set correctly. All cylinders are firing - if I remove the FI =
wire from an injector, the engine stumbles. (I know you are supposed to do =
this with the spark plug wire, but I got a 45,000 volt surprise when I =
tried that.)

I received and installed a new EGR valve (Thanks Karl!!). The new EGR =
valve leaks a little (i.e. when closed it sucks through a little air), but =
even with it blocked off I still have this problem, so I don't think the =
issue is there.

I tried adjusting the idle mixture. I opened the screw up to two turns =
from where it was, I also closed it two turns from where it was. No =
difference, so I put it back to where it was.

I have sprayed carb cleaner all around looking for a vaccum leak and it =
did not seem to make a difference. EXCEPT, I did spray carb cleaner into =
the mouth of the air box and that made it run closer to normal. That's the =
only thing that had an impact.

Any suggestions would be appreciated!

Thanks once again,

Mark
