Subject: Intake Manifold Sealing (was erratic idle)

&quot;1) What sort of a sealing compound should I use on the gasket for the 
carb-manifold junction? I'll avoid RTV if I can.
2) Same as question 1 but where the manifold bolts to the head.
3) This was a 914 FI engine.  On cylinder #3 near the furthest-forward 
manifold bolt there is something screwed into the block.  It looks a 
bit like a pipe that has been pinched shut.  Is this a boss for a 
Temperature sender?&quot;
 
1. If the surfaces are clean and true (not warped) you should not really need much of any sealant at all. A small amount of RTV used here I dont think is going to hurt. (Flame suit Donned)
2. Same answer. 
3. That is either an old temp sender for FI system or more likely part of an air injection port from an old EGR system. Best bet is to leave it alone. I have tried removing these in the past with mixed results. Sometimes they are really frozen in there and you end up doing more damage than good getting them out. Preferred solution is to remove and plug the hole but that can be more trouble than its worth.
