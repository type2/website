&gt; This is the classic pattern for sundial campers. I found that's what the '62
&gt; I've been looking at was. Does it have a roof vent?

&gt; Good luck! Joe
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;This was obviously a panel converted into a camper [included adding
&gt; &gt;windows to each door and one on the driver's side] 

No roof vent.  The interior looks well done, but I just assumed that
it was homegrown...any other tell tale signs?

There is one more interesting tidbit that I forgot to mention in my
original post.  Not only does this van have the nine louvres on each
side for the engine room [punched outwards, as opposed to inwards on
the later splitties], but it also has an additional three louvres on
each side right below the drip rail and in-line with the engine air
louvres.  Is this helpful?  I assume that it is common to the early
60's panels?

It also had the single bench seat and reserve fuel tank lever,
overridders, antenna mounted on side of van behind drivers door [must
be after market], but the radio knock-out panel was still in place.

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!
