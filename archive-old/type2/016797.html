   I think the Graber is the one I'm going to buy -- they make one that
goes on the ball (or in the receiver hole if you have that type hitch)
-- but they also have one that fits over a spare tire, and that's the
one I'm going to buy. About $80. I've looked at other spare tire
mounting bike racks, but they all were too large in the part that went
behind the tire, this newer Graber looks like it will work, but I've
only seen the picture in a catalog thus far.
     I only want to carry 2 bikes at most -- if you want to carry more,
I'd be a bit worried about the load on the spare tire mount, and you'd
probably be better off with a rear ball hitch mount or roof mounts. I've
put my bike on my Yakima top mounts, but it's a real bugger to get on
and off.
