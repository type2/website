Subject: Mexico VWs?

Hey guys,

	I was just talking to a co-worker about Mexican Volkswagens and I
had a few questions....

1) What was the last year they produced the &quot;Bay Window&quot; Bus in Mexico?

2) Is it legal to buy a fairly new Bay window Bus from Mexico, swap the vin
tags and frame pieces and call it an American 1973 Bus?

3) Did they ever produce the Vanagon in Mexico?

4) How about the Thing, and all the Type3 VWs like hte squareback,
notchback, etc.
