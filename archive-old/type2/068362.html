     If anyone's interested I picked this up off of a motorcycle list I am 
     a member of.  It involves a VW motor/trans in an old BMW m/c frame.

     &gt;Guess I get elected on this one.  I have 4 Willis conversions and 
     have 
     modified the trans personally on the last one I did.
     
     Let me know what you need-have spare trans.
     
     For others interested- The BMW/Willis conversions (aka R60/4) was a 
     job 
     shop conversion effected in the early 1960's in the US in which a 1500 
     cc VW was put into a /2 with suprisingly little mods.  The frame was 
     lengthened only about 1.5 inches and widened at the front to 
     accomidate 
     the VW motor. A cut down &quot;6 volt&quot; VW flywheel was adapted to the /2 
     clutch, an adapter was used to install the VW 12 volt gen and a myriad 
     of exhaust systems and intakes were used.  Frequently, the VW had some 
     cast exhaust boxes from Willis to rerout the # 2 and 3 VW exhaust down 
     and forward away from the gearshift and the riders feet.
     
     The trans is really the heart of the conversion. In the 1960's prior 
     to 
     CNC machining the trans was modified to overdrive it so that the 
     overall effective gear ratio was more in line with the VW torque 
     curve.
     Without this mod the top speed of the conversion would have been about 
     50 mph.  The entire conversion and the underlying logic is too 
     much---I 
     have a file that I can find if anyone requests.
     
     PS the result is actually a usable machine that isnt something stupid 
     like the Boss Hog Chevy conversions. PSS Paced _at_ 120 by my Viper on my 
     1600 dual Dellorto Willis conversion and probably it had more but I 
     didnt.
