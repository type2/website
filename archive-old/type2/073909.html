Subject: Re moisture and elec. vs propane heaters

Having spent many a night in a Westy with it being only 15-20 deg
outside, I can speak with authority:
1. Your body/breathing exudes moisture and it WILL condense on cold
parts, most noticably the windows.  You either must reduce the moisture
buildup (open window) or warm up the bus to tropical proportions to warm
the surfaces and keep more moisture (higher vapor pressure).  The latter
is not efficient.  You can also treat the surfaces with insulation to
prevent moist air from flowing by and making contact (why they flocked
the poptop of later Westies)- I made &quot;storm windows&quot; that snap over the
screen/widow frame of the jalousies, and use homeade triple layered
curtains over the other windows.  I have a tight curtain that separates
the front seat area from the rear.  You can also sew in a layer of mylar
(space blanket) to keep heat in.  Having built a house that uses hardly
a cord of wood all winter, I know that most heat loss is through
unwanted air gaps.  Given a reasonably tight bus (top down, windows
shut) even a single body heat can warm it to 15 deg or so above outside
temp.
For breathing, enough air leaks around the doors, window tracks and
poptop tent.
2. Any internal non-vented cumbustion heater adds to this moisture and
should be used at a minimum, and I never use one all night.  Propane
burns clean but takes away the oxygen, so you gotta sacrifice efficiency
and crack a window.  Cooking in the van helps to warm it if you have a
deluxe Westy or use a single burner free standing stove with the tank
under the burner- the one with the folding arms is more stable than the
little ring- I took off the latter and added a 10&quot; square stainless
steel fence hunk that used a 1&quot; square mesh.  It's held on by a &quot;ground
down on 2 sides&quot; dished washer that comes with grinding disks for
drills.  I also use a single mantle lantern that helps warm your hands. 
For the &quot;warm me up quickly so I can get dressed&quot; option I have a
radiant propane head that is a parabola with a steel mesh that glows as
the burning gas heats it- radiant heat warms whatever it hits, so it is
fast at warming your clothes or you, but I only use it for a short
time.  BTW, I stand it on the garbage stool aimed at the windshield for
quick defrosting to scrape outside ice or melt frozen condensate I can
wipe with a towel.
3.  Electric Heaters come now as radiant/convection or mostly
convection.  The radiants are not safe, as they can melt or even burn
anything that's a foot in front of them!   Convection heaters are safer
but vary in use- all electrics produce the same BTU's per watt,  but the
delivery varies in comfort.  Too much air (at low power) doesn't feel
very warm because it is too much draft against the skin.  I use an
electric &quot;flat to the floor&quot; adjustable angle heater with a squirrel
cage fan.  Squirrel cage heaters are quieter- you can find a smaller
heater, but the smaller fans are noisier to force air through the
coils.  Camping World offers one I like, a compact, plastic bodied so
called ceramic type (no glowing coil visible) that you can adjust to
blow upwards, and features the most comfortable low setting (about 700
watts) of all I've tried.  There's enough flow on high so it will not
burn anything resting against it.
