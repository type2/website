I have a '74 California model bus 1800 engine which I'm rebuilding at present. The wiring from the coil and the voltage regulator, as well as the thick red wire that goes from the alternator to the starter motor are all in pretty bad shape with the insulation melted away in various spots and bare wire visible. Now the question is, can I get heat resistant 12v wire or do I use the usual bog standard type? Is there some kind of heat resistant shrouding I could use to prevent these wires from being melted when they come into contact with the hot engine case? Why is the wire from the alternator to the starter so thick? It would appear that it carries more than just 12v, and if so what voltage does it carry? Answers on an e-mail please to the above address!
