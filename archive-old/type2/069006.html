Subject: oil bath flap

After reading an interesting post on the flap that controls warm air in the 
oil bath filter, I have a question. How does that sucker work? Is it 
adjustable? Mine has a vacuum dashpot connected to it for some reason, so I 
figure it must hook up to the carb with a vacuum line. Am I wrong? Bob 
Wallace, the original postee, adjusted his and cured a wicked stalling 
problem. Perhaps I can do the same.
