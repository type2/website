William,
One suggestion to your problem of &quot;detonation&quot; under load conditions:
Consider the possiblity that what you are hearing is not detonation from the 
engine but rather the clicking of a CV-joint that has gone low on grease. I 
struggled for many miles with what I thought was pinging, when going up 
hills; but the gradual leakage of grease out the flanges of the cv-joints 
was the ultimate cause of my problem. The correction was simple: add some 
cv-joint grease to all joints.
