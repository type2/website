&gt;David, mine fit like a glove.  No gaps anywhere.  I started with a bare
&gt;long block and added all the '78 accesories one at a time.  All fit no

All I can say is that the above directly conflicts with my experience, and 
since I am just as confident in your information as I am of my own, I can 
only conclude that some Vanagon blocks are a direct swap, and some are 
not.  If that is the case, I guess the only answer is to check what you've 
got.  :-/  I hate unsolved mysteries...
