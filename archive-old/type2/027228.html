Hey y'all
I was given some 'free time off' from work as a result of a rather unpopular 
e-mail I sent (see I do it to everyone!) and the fact that I had a chunk cut 
out of my side Tuesday last.  After about 2 days at the Karmarosa unable to 
split wood or climb trees I decided the Tinkertoy needed a tune up and oil 
change.  Gathering my tools from the Ugly Knocking Waterpumper I strolled to 
the barn with toolkit and a hot fresh cup of coffee.

Open the engine room lid and peer inside.  The simplicity of a 67 bus 
greeted me like a long lost friend.  With Rocky the Big Dog sticking his 
nose in the hole in my side I removed the plugs.  #s 1 &amp; 3 looked slightly 
darker than 2 &amp; 4.  Hmmm.  A spot of Never Seeze on the threads, gaps set 
spot on, new plugs go in like they belong there.  Oh yeah, they do!  Chase 
Rocky away because when he jams his nose in my side it hurts.

Roll the engine over to #2 TDC, pop valve cover.  #2 exhaust is about .003 
too loose, set to spec, roll engine to #1 TDC.  #1 intake is the same, a bit 
loose, tighten, roll engine to #4 TDC.  Same pattern of looseness on this 
side.  Corresponds with the difference I noticed in the plugs.  This is also 
consistent with the way this engine has acted since initial startup in 1988.

Connect the battery, get about 1 turn of the engine.  Ok, I put off cleaning 
the major electrical connections long enough.  Battery posts and grounds get 
a good brightening while the charger hums away.  The Tinkertoy's been 
hanging out in the barn for the last 6 months, getting the occasional run on 
nice days over the winter.  Not enough to keep the batt'ry fresh.  
Connections clean, she starts right up on about 1/2 turn of engine, just 
like she usually does.  Mmmmmm, such a sweet bus.

A couple turns around the block, big grin on my face, all the windows open 
to let the warm North Carolina breeze caress me.   Pull back in, do the oil 
change.

Sherry had taken the Ugly Knocking Waterpumper into work and had called me 
as soon as she arrived cussin' me out for making her take it, seeing as 
she's not used to and doesn't like driving it.  I made her take it so I 
could check out the water leak in the WifeandKidmobile.  Ok, big grin 
continues after oil change, take the long way into town and arrive in time 
to take her to lunch.  Take the Ugly Knocking Waterpumper (UKWp) home and 
crawl under the WifeandKidmobile.  Nasty water leak from right front of 
head.  Unkind words spoken about then.  Still, can't really complain after 
164k miles.

Close hood, go take nap because I can, get up play guitar (poorly) in the 
sun.  Phone rings.

Guess what?  It's Sherry cussin' me out again.  Seems the Tinkertoy won't 
turn over for her.  Tell her to try to bump start it since I left it parked 
on enough of an incline to bump it if needed.  she tries the bump start 
thing but I forgot to tell her to turn the key on =8^0

Phone rings again, COME GET ME!!!!!!  Load a set of jumper cables in the 
UKWp, down to town with kid riding shotgun.  Sherry had PUSHED the Tinkertoy 
back up the incline into a parking spot.  Connect cables turn key, 1/2 
engine rotation later she's chuffling happily.  Mmmmmm

Follow her home, Tinkertoy looks good going down the road, the Return to 
Domestic Bliss ensues.

I dunno if rescuing your own bus counts as an AIRS success but that's close 
enough for me.

Mad Uncle Dave
