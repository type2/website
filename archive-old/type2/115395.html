Subject: BNNTA event update...

Hi all,

I just got back from attending the Eureka Springs VW event down in Arkansas.
Quite interesting...  They definitely need to move to a more
participant-friendly event location, otherwise, it was a great event.  Lots of
Busses of all kinds in attendance.

If you'd like info on the &quot;Busses Nowhere Near The Arch #19&quot; VW camping event
coming up this coming weekend (Aug 29-Sept 1, 2003), just go to www.BNNTA_dot_com
for the details.

As an update, &quot;the Weather Channel&quot; is now forecasting a cold front to move in
on Wednesday, and that the daytime high temps in the BNNTA area ought to be in
the mid-80's throughout the Labor Day holiday weekend!!!!!  We may be getting
another great weather break for the third year in a row!  They also mention
the chance for isolated t-storms.

Everything is shaping up to make for another memorable VW camping weekend.
Just thought you'd want to know the latest info on this weekend's VW
festivities.  Also, all makes and types of VW's are welcome, not just Busses!

Hope to see some of you soon!
