Subject: Re: [T2] using a used head

CC both sets of heads after fly cutting them to the
same depth so they will be close. Make sure that you
have clearnce so that the cyl's will make a air tight
fit without the sholders hitting. check your
compression to make sure it's not to high, try for 7
to 7.3 to 1. Use cyl' base shims to set the deck
hight. Good luck with it, Phil
