Subject: carb identification

Hello everyone --

I recently bought a 2L engine to do a ground up rebuild for my 79 bus.  I've gotten to know my fuel injection system pretty well, and I like it, so I want to keep it.  But the engine that I bought had been converted to a single carburetor.  It's a Holley carb, but I can't identify it any further than that.  I don't see anything like a part number stamped anywhere on it, although there is a 7 digit number inked onto the body.  This number doesn't correspond to anything I can find of the Holley website though.  Anybody know how I can identify this carb?  

Thanks,

Charles
