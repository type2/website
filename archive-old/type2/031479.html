&gt; Hi Folks, I have one that came off a '71, hauled
&gt; plenty of bugs with it, great unit to have, mounts to
&gt; rear frame, remove your bumber (2 - 17mm bolts each
&gt; side) there is also a 3rd bolt hole which would be
&gt; best to clean out with a 10mm 1.0 tap, if interested I
&gt; am in Maryland, also have several tons of parts,
&gt; engines trans iceboxes interior doors sheet metal lots
&gt; of 2.0 Liter engines call me direct 410-551-4892
