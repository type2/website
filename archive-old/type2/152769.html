Technically, Chris, you're right. But it's interesting that we in the 
baywindow community would mention powdercoating as an answer to a 
question about the &quot;best way to restore&quot; ....

Elsewhere in the classic and vintage car world, powdercoating a wheel 
would be the antithesis of restoring it!

Just an observation, nothing at stake.
