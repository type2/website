Craig--

Well, you've clarified for me information that is incomplete on my web
page, that is, I gave an example of the date code for my bus which had
three numbers, yours only has two.  This is because before VW went to the
three digit prefix (215 being a type 2 panel van '65 model year) they
needed to indicate the year in the date code.  After '65 they didn't need
to, so only two numbers, so your date code would be 6 April.  (Thanks, I'll
update this.)

BUT, this still doesn't explain why your date code says April 6 when the
VIN is from early May.  I wouldn't rule out an error on the plate, after all,
somebody in the factory had to set up each bus's VIN plate individually,
maybe they just goofed.  Is there any chance that layers of paint or a bad
stamping made the digits unclear?  Here's a scenario:  the plate-stamping
machine probably had little wheels with raised numbers on the outside.  On
4/5 all the plates for 4 May were made, then on the morning of 5/5 the
semi-hungover overseer of the plate-stamping machine (this is, of
course, one word in German :-) Der UberPflatStampingeWerkeArbeiterFurhrer)
rolled the wrong wheel one digit, making
it say 4/6 instead of 5/5.  :-)  Now all we need to do is find another
bus made on that same day before somebody figured out the mistate.
