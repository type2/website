Greetings

I never thought much about owning a Vanagon untill I took a two month trip 
cross country(in a Pathfinder) and feel in love with the lifestyle. I now 
fully realize the Vanagon's potential and I must have one. I've come across 
what seems to me to be a good buy - yet I don't know anything about 
Vanagon's or a whole lot about cars in general - it's a 82' type2 with 45K 
original motor and an immaculate interior the body is in decent shape only 
needs a paint job and replacement of exterior rusted bolts, etc.- seems to 
run well. The seller is asking $3000. What should I know about this model? 
What should I check/watch out for? And what should I expect from this model?

Carl
