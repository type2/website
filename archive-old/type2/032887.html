Subject: Re: DM

Da Mothership....thats what DM means!

DM could also mean &quot;Dumbass Mechanic&quot;, or even &quot;Demeaning Mechanic&quot;.  The 
mechanic in question would be a dumbass in thinking his knowledge was so 
great, that he didn't need to explain things to his customers or 
colleagues.   In this case scenario you would now have the &quot;Demeaning 
Dumbass Mechanic&quot; which would be acronized DDM.  He could even pull teeth 
if he were a mind too, or at least he probably would think he could.

After reading this thread a little I am detecting an amount of arrogance 
on the part of  the founding father.  There are a lot of folks on the 
list these days that I think aspire to be the new John Muir, and some 
tend to want to regurgitate their knowledge in a haughty sort of way.   
Don't think too much of yourselves folks.  This list is here to help 
people enjoy themselves with there busses, not become Dr. Pohn.

My Grandmother  (who did not drive  Volkswagen bus) used to say if you 
bought some people for what they were worth, and sold them for what they 
&quot;thought&quot; they were worth you would never have to work again.  

We on this list seem to be suffering an onslaught of these folks these 
days.  Know-it-alls who have found a place to peddle their wares of 
knowledge with just enough arrogance to insult.

If we are to be a reasonable community focused on interaction, 
fellowship, and knowledge sharing then let's be it at a liesurly pace, 
not one that insults others for their lack of knowledge, or &quot;your&quot; lack 
of patience.  Not that anyone has done that directly, but keep in mind it 
can be done &quot;indirectly&quot; as well.  We must be conscious of one another, 
thats the rule.

I have gotten to where I don't even read some folks post because I 
already know they are going to be lacking any personality or manners in 
their delivery.  They just cast the information out there as cold columns 
of stone.  I don't ask for personal interaction but I do prefer simple 
humaness.  

I don't want  structure as much as  I want sincere assistance offered 
because the fellow list member genuinely wants to help.  I want to hear 
it from the horse's mouth, and not his ass.   I want to interact with 
people over the issue, real people not &quot;we think&quot; robots.  I think some 
folks have a committee formed to develop answers to threads.

I will go to the archives for most information, but I will also now and 
then bring up a subject that has been discussed before if the need be.   

I will be respectful of the list and not bring up tired old subjects like 
tires, although I did purchase a set of Uniroyal Laredo 6 plys here a 
while back.  Damn good tigerpaws so far.  The Mothership rides smoother 
and takes corners much better.  Doesn't lean or pull at all.  : )

Keep the faith people.  To those of you that have joined A.I.R.S. I want 
to offer my sincere thanks.  The group worked well recently for Nikki and 
has already worked for several others.  there are still some states we 
need to fill, like Arkansas and Louisiana.  Maybe it will work for you 
guys one day too.  I hope so, that's why it was created.

I especially want to thank Wade for his hard work.  

This is all just my humble opinion of course.  Sorry if this is way off 
subject Sean, Steve, and Ken, and George.

Thanks for tolerating the ramblings,
Charlie Ford
