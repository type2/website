Hi Lee,

It would fit fine. The only problem with a '72 is the lack of a rear  
hatch above the engine. But you could deal with that by transferring  
the hatch from your current bus.


Happy Trails,

&gt; Do you know if I would be able to use my 77 interior stuff on the  
&gt; 72?  I know that there is no electrical hookup on the 72 (or  
&gt; water?).  Would it be difficult to add these things?  I'd be stoked  
&gt; if I could find a 77-79 with good body and transmission with  
&gt; crapped out motor and rough interior near me  That would be perfect.
