&gt; List,
&gt; I went to the local VW shop for some valve adjusters, because mine were
&gt; hosed.
&gt; When I picked up the new ones, they were way too small.  So, I go back, and
&gt; it ends up they are watercooled vanagon rocker arms and adjusters.  They
&gt; have the bigger 15mm jam nut, and a bigger adjuster.  Is there any benefit
&gt; to this setup?  Are the rockers themselves any better?

Do you have a Mexican engine?  Both of my mexican engines came with large
adjusters.  So far they seem to be fine, though I don't have much cause to
adjust them.
