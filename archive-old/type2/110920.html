Subject: Re: [T2] can i get a starter by tomorrow?

thanks yall
do you think bob since you always have it rebuilt....
do you think when the big wire on the big bolt touched the smalledr plug wire it burnt the brushes up?
i dont know much about starters except for i have been told before people just putting new brushes in them so thats why i say what i do!

&gt;&gt; I am going to check around today and see if i can find a starter somewheres..
&gt;&gt; i want a bosch starter rebuilt/new doesnt matter...
&gt;
&gt;check the phone book of any decent sized city for a starter/alternator
&gt;rebuilder.  I have never bought a starter, I have all mine rebuilt by a
&gt;local guy who seems to know what he is doing have never had one go South
&gt;on me.._dot_usually one day service and a lot less than a new or store bought
&gt;rebuilt (which is what this guy does for some of the local FLAPS)
