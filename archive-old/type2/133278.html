&gt; i have a trailer hitch that i fabbed and i need to paint it in short order

&gt; the question is what primer and paint combination could i use for this and
&gt; keep the paint cost under $50.  i normally use sherwin williams industrial

heck Terry will probably have a fit, but for this application a couple
coats of Rust-o-leum would probably work fine..

Rattle cans are not all bad.
