&gt;Billy, set the timing statically...do you know how to do that?
&gt;Set the engine on #1 with the timing mark where it would be if it
&gt;were running.  attach a test light to the dist and then rotate it &gt;around until the light *just* comes on and tighten it down.  This &gt;will always be close enough to get it running a little.

So if the magic number is 7.5before static, then that occurs two times in one complete engine cycle, so I have to verify that I'm at 7.5 before for #1, not #3 right?

&gt;if it is aftermarket electronic ign, then check that the &quot;sender&quot; &gt;on the dist shaft is on there correctly and tight...I have had to &gt;shim a pertronix on a 009 just a little with a piece of paper to &gt;get it to sit &quot;tight&quot;.

Okay, I haven't really messed with these things much. I have VW elec ignition on my '79 engine, and I don't ever touch it.

&gt;Eyeball the insides of the dist and little tip inside...good &gt;cond???  or rotor and pickup points inside the dist all &quot;burned&quot;?

Dist. cap and rotor had mild build up, but not burned.

&gt;pull spark plug wires one at a time for a few seconds...any 
&gt;difference....one doesn't realy change anything?

The wires seem to be heading to different cylinders than mine, when compared. How do I verify which wire at the dizzy is for where?

&gt;Check the dwell...even with electronic points.

I don't know how to do this, I have to do some investigation.

Thanks Dave and list.

Billy
