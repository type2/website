Subject: The two bus garage

I mentioned last week that I bought a '71 camper for parts.  Last 
night I finally took delivery.

The bus was in need of something in the clutch system and had little 
or no brakes.  I decided that the best course of action would be to 
pay the bill and tow it to my house.  This is a parts bus and I
was not interested in spending a half day on it so just so I can part 
it out when I get it home.  It will never needs it's brakes again.

In the 90 minute wait for the tow truck (maybe I should have just 
fixed it) I had some time to read.  The bus had seen at least 
six owners and the most recent one provided me a small ledger and some
sales slips for parts and repairs.  No box of parts or the orginal 
steering wheel.  So I checked out the ledger.  The first two owners 
kept very accurate records.  Every oil change and tuneup is noted.  
They mentioned when they used new gaskets and when they reused the old
one.  Even I don't keep this kind of detail in my bus log.  Very 
interesting reading.  I might post some of the highlights in the 
future.  All the mileage and breakdown records make for good data 
points on various components.

This bus had a pretty huge hit in the left front.  This is noted as 
well.  The hit was quite large.  Some &quot;idiot&quot; ran a light.  The owner 
settled with the insurance company, who totaled the thing.  He then 
bought it back for $330 and promptly had the dent pulled out by a 
local body shop.  It went to California a couple of months later.  I 
guess I feel even better parting out this heap knowing that it was 
pronounced dead fifteen years ago.

So, the long and short of it is that we finally got it coaxed into the
garage.  My garage will fit three cars but only one door works.  Bay 
three, on the far end, houses the work bench and shelving for parts 
and such.  Bay two now has the parts bus.  The tow driver backed it 
most of the way in and then I jacked the backend up on the floor jack 
and drug it sideways into the spot.  Bay one is for my driver bus.  
You only need about 30 inches on a side to do almost any repair to the
bus, more on the engine end.  This is what I will have until I finish 
the parting out and get it out of there.  Of course, now that my 
neighbors don't have to look at it I might just take my time.

Thanks go out to the half dozen kind folks who e-mailed me that it was
ok to part out a bus, and send it to the crusher, so long as I wasn't 
the one who drove it into that condition.  It will go there with a 
minimum number of parts.  Some will be up for sale in the near future.
The engine is already sold. Thanks for listening. Jim (two bus owner!)
