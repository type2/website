Subject: Gaskets for air distribution box?

I'm still preping parts for the install of a rebuilt engine in my 80 Westy.
Down to the last few parts now! Picked up the air dist. box with the throttle
assembly, egr valve, and cold start injector still attached with the idea of
cleaning it up last night. After looking it over I started wondering about the
gaskets between these parts. I don't recall seeing these in any catalogs.

Can I make the gaskets for the EGR valve and cold start inj. from bulk gasket
material?

Is the gasket that is between the throttle and air dist. box still available
anywhere?

How do you disconnect the linkage between the throttle and EGR valve? It looks
like both ends are held on with a circular keeper that was pressed on and will
probly be dammaged when I try to remove it.

I am also thinking about taking the EGR valve apart for cleaning. Do I just
take it apart and soak in carb cleaner or are there any tricks I should know
before I do it. I am planning to cap off the EGR for now because of missing
filter and the pipe that should be coming out of the exhaust has been cut off
and welded shut, but would like to know the valve is in working condition in
case I ever get around to repairing the rest of the system.

Thanks again,
Tom
