&gt; Ya know - after a very positive reply to my query
&gt; letter - I sent Hot VWs an article and a photo
&gt; submission about the resto-customization of
&gt; my '68 Bus - and after SIX months they
&gt; returned it to me UNPUBLISHED! I think there
&gt; were two things working against me:

&gt;From what I've seen, most of these mags think VW stopped making vans in 
mid 67. Occasionally, VW Trends will slip in a picture of a Loaf camper, 
although every mag has at least one shot of Miss Cyclone and her runners 
up. As for Hot VWs, I only buy it for the articles (yeah, that's it... 
the articles), so you can see how often it's come into this house.

I'd forget about Hot VWs and try a couple of the other mags. I'd like to 
see a good post-66 resto... even if you are a woman. &lt;grin&gt;
