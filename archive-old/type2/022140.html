My neighbor across the street just found the light, and bought a type 2.
He is working on the muffler, and has the following question!?
Please reply to Craig at  ScheffC_at_novistar_dot_com

&gt;quick question that you may be able to lend some assistance on......i was
&gt;replacing the muffler on my bus recently and i noticed that, when i left 
&gt;the motor idling, it would interrupt with a &quot;chirp&quot; about every 30
seconds or so.  i
&gt;don't think the belt is slipping.  any idea as to where i can begin on
this 
&gt;one ??
&gt;
&gt;i'm taking the bus on its first major excursion this
&gt;weekend..........louisiana. can't wait to tackle that bridge over lake
charles.
