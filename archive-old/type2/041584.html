Subject: Do two thin wires = 1 thick wire?

Ok, I know this is a little on the cheap side, but that 10 or 12 guage wire 
is so so expensive.  I was wondering:  If I use two 16-guage wires, does 
that improve the power handling and efficiency of the wires?

I'm interested in using it to wire up my second battery, since my starter is 
in the front while my aux battery is in the rear, and I'd hate to buy that 
much 10 guage wire.....

Anyone?

And has anyone had any luck using 16 guage wire to charge the second 
battery?
