&gt;Now I read somewhere that you can take the torsion arms off the car, 
&gt;send them off, and the company (Wolfgang? Bus Boys?) will send you back some 
&gt;nice arms with new joints pressed in. What's the going rate for such a 
&gt;service, anyone know?

Bob, 

I use a set of arm/ball joints from Wolfgang - $125 exchange. They came in 
nicely 
painted and ready to go. I had trouble finding anyone who had the equipment 
for 
&quot;bus&quot; joints -- they aren't the same as bugs. You need the arms off the van 
and 
a very macho hydraulic press. A write up of the ball joint weekend is at 
http://coyote.accessnv_dot_com/wayback/b_joint.html

After doing it once I'd tackle it again -- not all that bad.
