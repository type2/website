&gt;My 81 vanagon has set for a few years the man i bought it from told me i

Some of the filler pipes are plastic and the expansion tanks are plastic but I thought all the Vanagon fuel tanks were metal unless it was a Diesel or Syncro. Someone on the Vanagon list would know for sure and whether or not you  can clean it sufficiently.

FYI, New metal reproduction gas tank are available... for $ 130 from CIP1.
