I am going to answer my own question, because I just thought of a 
solution that is plain elegant.

Materials needed: Squares of asphalt composition tile (30-50% coverage), 
a bucket of flooring cement and a special serrated trowel, some 6 mil 
plastic sheeting, silicone bath and kitchen caulk.

1. Coat the wrong side of each panel with cement. Let it set up 1-2 
hours (until tacky).

2. Attach tiles, taking care that they do not interfere with anything 
when you go to put the panels back. Apply pressure with roller.

3. Lay the plastic over the whole panel, and cut at the edge of the 
tiles. Press into place. Trim around panel edge.

4. Put a dab of caulk at each sheet metal screw hole, and run a bead 
around the edge of the panel. Put panel in place.

Voila! You have silenced the sounding board and put a vapor barrier all 
in one job!

I can't think of any reason this shouldn't work. Anyone?
