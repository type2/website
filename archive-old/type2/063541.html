Subject: Wiper fluid hitting wipers not windshield

I finally got around to adding the 35psi - 40psi of air pressure to my
window washer fluid resivoir and it works great accept that it either
sprays my wipers in stationary position or the sky when they are
moving.  Is there a way to adjust the jet so it hits a correct angle.
