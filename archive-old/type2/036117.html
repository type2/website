+AD4-70 westy needs help

+AD4-I was pulling into my parking place, put in clutch and breaking, heard
+AD4-pop and felt like clutch cable was broken.  Thinking damm, then thanks
+AD4-to Heidi for picking a good place to break.  Got under bus and cable is
+AD4-fine, and adjusted to the max.  I can move the arm on the tranny about 1
+AD4-inch easily (normal?).  Any ideas?

I hope it's not this but I had a similar event on my Beetle. The clutch then
wouldn't fully disengage. Turned out to be a couple of the activating levers
on the clutch had come adrift. Hadn't been in long.

I was able to drive it still, though on reflection it probably wasn't a good
idea, because if something had really given way it would have taken the
engine and trans casing with it.

I had to pull the engine and replace (well on this occasion somebody did it
for me)
