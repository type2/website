Patrick:

Could the evil P.O. have placed the wrong dizzy on it?  There's been lots of
discussion on the list about &quot;wrong&quot; dizzys causing hesitation and poor gas
mileage, among other things...

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;      This maybe long but I have to get some help here.  I bought my first
&gt; Vanagon Westy in October I think.  It is a stock 82 FI 2.0l westy camper.

.  sometimes when I downshift for a corner
&gt; to 2nd &amp; give it gas, there is a hesitation.  The car just goes flat for a
&gt; second or two.

I have tested both the vacuum
&gt; &amp; centrifugal advance &amp; they both are working
