Subject: Clutch interchangeability
Message-ID: &lt;Springmail.104.939387565.0.57291200_at_www.springmail_dot_com&gt;

We need to replace the clutch in our '72 Bus.  It slips
after it gets hot, but otherwise is fine.  We have a parts
'72 Bus, but it appears to have a Type IV car engine, not a
proper Bus engine.  Would the clutches and pressure plates
be the same between these two engines?

Thanks
