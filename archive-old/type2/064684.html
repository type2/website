This is suspicious.  I know that a couple of my rebuilds, way in the
dim, dark past, ended up with the float sticking inside the bowl, and
thus no fuel flowed.  Opening it up and reseating everything usually
fixed it.  Generous use of something permatex-like can cause such a
problem, as well.

You might try pulling the plugs on that side, and sniffing each
cylinder after manually rotating the engine through an intake cycle.
If you don't get a strong gasoline odor, I'd definitely be suspicious
of the float bowl on that carburetor.
