Hi Brian,

Just an opinion here.  But it's backed up by experience and fact.  Don't
trade your stock Solex's for the single progressive.  The Weber is a poor
carb for the bus.  See all the recent posts about pre-heating the intake air
and carb icing.  It WILL happen with the Weber.  I had one on my '72 so I
know.  It is impossible to tune to get good performance.  Do a search in the
archives on this carb if you don't want to believe just me.  Even when they
are brand new and properly tuned the performance sucks.  Here is what
happens.  Since you are now using manifolds that are about 2 feet long for
each cylinder, you have terrible throttle response.  When you push on the
gas, there is a noticeable lag before anything happens.  This is simply
because it takes that long for the gas to get to the cylinder.  This means
you have to anticipate green lights and keep the revs high to get any
torque.  You also will experience carb icing since you are in KY.  See posts
from earlier today and the past few days to explain it better.  It will
happen anyplace that even approaches freezing outdoor temperatures.  It does
happen above freezing outdoor temps.  When your manifolds ice, your bus will
just slowly start to die as it gasps for useable atomized fuel.  Now the ice
will melt after a while of sitting beside the road unless, God forbid, it
actually IS really cold outside.  In that case you will only need to get
towed to a heated garage.  It fixes itself so it's no big deal!  ;-)

The PDSIT's (or any dual carb) are just a far better design.  They are
mounted on short manifolds (great throttle response) and are directly above
the main source of heat in your engine (they'll never ice.)  The PDSIT's
also have chokes which aftermarket dual carbs do not.  So get those PDSIT's
rebuilt if you have to.  It might even cost you more than buying a brand new
Weber but do it anyway.  The place where these usually wear out are the
throttle shaft bushings.  They then leak air past the bushing so you get an
erratic idle and maybe 'popping' through the exhaust.  Performance is not
affected at higher RPM because at that point there is all kinds of air
rushing by through the open throttle plate.  So get a machinist who has done
this before to rebush the throttle shafts.  I think some of the listee's
have this ability.  Old Volk's Home does it I think.  If you can't find
someone, I have a local air cooled only mechanic here in WA that does it.
The other place these carbs fail is the bore that the electromagnetic
cut-off jets screw into.  How this happens is the electromagnetic cut-off
jets get loose and then start to bounce around as you drive.  If you don't
catch it right away, it ovals out the hole, destroys the threads
irreparably, and makes for a nice air leak.  Even this problem isn't fatal.
You can simply eliminate the electromagnetic cut-off jets and have a
machinist plug the hole.  The only side effect of this is that your engine
will continue to run for a fraction of a second after you turn off the key.
No big deal.

So think about your bus's performance with either carb choice and go for
what you think is best.  Good luck!
