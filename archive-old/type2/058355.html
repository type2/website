Subject: Rocker Panel Removal

Since the bay rocker replacement link is down on the type2 website I'd
thought I'd ask the list.  

	How do you completely remove the old rocker panel on a '71 bus under the
sliding door, that is, where was it spot welded on the top of the upper
channel or in the channel itself.  Also has anyone had success in pop
riveting the new panel over the upper part of the old one?

Thanks
