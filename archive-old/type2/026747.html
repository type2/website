Subject: Weber Carb, but what kind??
Date: Fri, 6 Jul 2001 12:10:24 -0400 
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have a center mount 2 barrel Weber carburetor. How can I find out exactly
what kind of Weber it is?  I do not know much about this carb, but maybe
somebody can identify it for me or point me in the right direction. Here is
what I do know. Center mount 2 barrel with Weber stamped on it. I have a
type 4 engine. It uses dual manifolds on each side to feed the engine and
has no heat risers to warm the air. I think this is the progressive carb,
but were would a part number be to know for sure the size? I also have an
almost identical one that has Holley made by Weber stamped in the bottom of
the float bowl.

Also, I read tech articles that do not recommend this carb since it is hard
to tune and will not work in the winter (no heat risers). This bus came from
Arizona, so it has not seen cold before. Like I posted to the list before, I
can get a set of stock duals for the bus fairly cheap. I cannot afford new
dual carbs nor can I afford FI. This carb ran good but I would rather get
the bus ready for winter while it is warm, instead of after it gets cold
outside.

Any help is appreciated,
Corbett
