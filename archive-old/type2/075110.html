Subject: volt meter hookup

Got a VDO volt meter outta a crushed Rabbit
convertible.

1. What's the best way to wire it in my '68 bus? BTW
what will it tell me that will be helpful?

Had some warm weather this weekend. Insulated. Put in
the full-width folding bed and the Westy table I've
torn out of junkers. I guess i've counterfeited a
&quot;weekender.&quot;

2. Saw a small poptop on a junked splittie. I'm
tempted. Does anyone know if the curve of the roof is
the same for splitties as the bays? If i can get it
cheap, i'll sew in some mosquito netting where the
canvas rotted.
