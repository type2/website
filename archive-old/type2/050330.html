Subject: [T2] want easy roof access??

Hello all,

In looking around and thinking about how a roof rack would work on my
transporter the thought of how I would get up there easily came to mind.
After all the bus is pretty tall to reach up to the roof, even for me at
over 6 foot.

I came across this cool little devise that connects to your tire, supporting
up to a 285 (or 265) pound load. Its just under 40 bucks, and folds flat for
storage. If you ever wished you had easier access to your roof to use that
luggage rack check out http://www.prolineracks_dot_com/techstep200.html for more
information.

Just thought id share, we'll see if I can ever actually hunt one down or
not.

Christopher
75 Transporter
