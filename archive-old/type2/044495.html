Subject: [T2] Clanging my way through Oregon

actually its doubly wierd for me: when i visit my family in southern
jersey, the other no-pump-it-yourself state, it becomes a dream from which
i cannot awake. everytime in oregon, i have to remind the attendant how to
deal with the rubber hose to the gas tank. early on, when i first moved
here it was a race to get to the attendant while they jammed the nozzle
crazily trying to fill'er up. glad to have a locking gas cap - not for
criminals, but to give me time to instruct sonny boy not to crack the
antique.

if you are still in the portland area, west side of town on hwy26,
visit the vietnam verteran's memorial in washington park.
