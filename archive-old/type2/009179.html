RE:	Help 1st and 2nd gear have gone.

I have had no previuos problems with my transmission.

Driving along a straight road coming into a town, third hard to get into,
second and first impossible.

Pull over check clutch freeplay, thats fine.

PC: Is your clutch dragging? Try any gear, with the clutch disengaged, on the level
and you'll soon find out.



Play with gear stick can get 3rd 4th and reverse no problem at all, but 1st
and 2nd are not there at all. Drive home in 3rd and 4th, these change
smoothly.

PC: I bet they are! Just that you can't 'feel' your way around the slack linkage.


At home loosen two bolts at base of gear stick can still get 3rd, 4th and
reverse and then eventually find second. Tighten up bolts. I now have a
second gear that I can just get and 3rd, 4th and reverse are fine.  But no
first.

Is there a procedure to adjust the plate at the bottom of the gear stick?

PC: Yes.

1. Engage second gear
2. Loosen bolts
3. Move gearstick and its base plate so that the lever is in the correct position,
I don't remember how its described but its something like vertical, at 30°. Basically,
so it looks right in relation to the seat(s).
4. Move plate under the one attached to the lever (lets call it the reverse stopper
plate) so that the reverse stopper is against the lever ball.
5. Tighten bolts
6. Check that a) 1st-2nd and 3rd-4th is directly fore/aft, b) all gears, particularly
reverse, first, second are engagable

Is there anything else I should check?

PC: Well worth checking the condition of the rubber boots in the linkage, they often
detiorate and make gear changes difficult/sloppy. You could also drain the gearbox
oil and look at the magnetic drain plug and the oil condition - easier than pulling
the transmission completely! When I did mine I found 3-4 teeth on it - sure sign of
failure.

With the plate loose should I be able to find all the gears, and because I
cant find first does that mean I need a new transmission?

PC: No. With the plate loose, you can't really put enough leverage on the system to
engage and disengage gears willy-nilly. Hence why we place the gearbox in 2nd before
the adjustment procedure.

The gears on this van have always been nice and crisp and easy to find and
there has been no graduall deteriation.

PC: So there was no crunch, bang, or wheel-lock associated with a gear stripping its teeth?
It just went sloppy? I reckon your linkage at the gearbox end has fallen apart!


I would be most gratefull of any help.
