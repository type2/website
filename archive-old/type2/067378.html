        Chamelion writes that the new formula gas in California gives,
&quot;*a decrease in gas mileage, at least 1-2mpg (mines down about 3mpg)&quot;

        I haven't seen this effect in my Corrado, either in the
trip computer's MPG calculations OR my own tank-and-miles numbers.
25.6mpg for the last 20 months.

        My carb-equiped (bone-stock) 1600sp idles fine when warm,
but does seem to have a little trouble with the transition to idle
when cold. (Ok, California 'cold'- 55F :) )
