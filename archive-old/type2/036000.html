	An alternative to rolling the whole vehicle, which would
certainly work, is to jack-up one rear wheel and turn it with your
foot while watching the distributor. Be easier to do this on a bus
than on my old 914 too... look-up &quot;awkward&quot; in the dictionary and
you'll see a picture of me lying over the trunk, arms in the
engine compartment, turning the right rear-wheel with my foot :)
