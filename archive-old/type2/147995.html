Subject: CHT drop

I am one of those people who spends more time looking at their CHT 
gauge than the road! I couldn't help but notice last Saturday that it 
was sitting at just above 300 deg on the open road when it normally 
sits at 350 deg. (This is in a 76 2l camper with weber icts). 
Hopefully this is a permanent change and not an aberration!

Some of the things that could have contributed are:
- putting in an Carter electric fuel pump. I suspect I was running a 
bit lean with the mechanical pump under high load
- blocking up the hole that lets you access the alternator tensioning 
bolt with a piece of al flashing. No doubt lots of hot air is sucked 
in through here!
- tightening the rear engine hatch by adjusting the catch. I noticed 
I could see daylight past the seal so some air mixed with hot exhaust 
from behind the bus would have been sucked in through here.

I'll let you know if this is a permanent change when I get out for a 
longer trip.

Cheers,

Martin.
