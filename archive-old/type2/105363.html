Subject: Low compression in rebuilt engine

So here is the continuing saga of my rebuilt AVP 2.0L engine on the
'82 Westy.

Previously, I had reported that the engine was hard to turn.

After tightening the fan belt, and with the help of a neighbour to
hold the belt against the pulley, I was able to turn the engine.

I read Boston Engine's (Bob's) notes on valve adjustments on hydraulic
lifter engines and tried to set the valve lash to 0.006 for each of
the cylinders.

After that, I ran a compression test.

The bad news : while cylinders 2 and 4 had about 110-120 psi. 1 &amp; 2
were down to 60-70.

The results were the same even when I backed out the valve adjusters a
little bit more (so that the valves would really be closed as a result
of the springs).

All this was done on a stone cold engine.

Just to confirm : to adjust valve lash, I set #1 to TDC with the mark
on the crank pulley lined up on 0 degress on the plastic scale and
with the distributor rotor lined up with the mark on the distributor.
Then I turn backwards (counterclockwise) 180 degrees and do #2, 180
degrees backwards for #3 and 180 degrees backwards for #4.
