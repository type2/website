Subject: Re: [T2] Yikes - Paint is Expensive

I agree, these products are amazing and worth it.  There is enough  
competition to keep the prices honest (BASF, PPG, Dupont, Transtar,  
etc.)  It is incredible how long a finish will look good, when the  
good stuff is used correctly.

&gt; Designing a coating that will do that is not a trivial exercise,  
&gt; and they
&gt; don't sell nearly as much car paint as they do house paint.
