Subject: Re: [T2] Junk Vehicle Law

This reminds me years ago when I had a 72 Bus, I was helping a friend, who
lived in Flossmoor, IL, when two cops stopped to check out my Bus parked in
front of the house.  Flossmoor had recently revived an old law about trucks
of any nature not being allowed inside city limits.  That included privatley
owned pickup trucks.  The cops were going so far as to peek inside garage
windows and leaving tickets in residents' mailboxes.

Well anyway, the two cops made a pass or two around the Bus, scratched their
heads, and one of them said, &quot;I don't know what it is.&quot;  Then they left.  My
friend and I watched from the garage and were quite amused.  Wonder what
they would have said if I'd have told them it was a station wagon?
