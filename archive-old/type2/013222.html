Stan said
&gt;About mounting a wench.
&gt;Wenches are a popular item to get stolen. I've lost many of them over the
&gt;last thirty years.

Well now every wench I've mounted in a Vw has stayed mounted, good and
proper.
Loose wenchs are to be prefered in fact.
Anyone stealing my wench would be dealt with summarily.
