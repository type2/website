Hello all knowledgeable listees,

        I did manage to get the muffler in that I was talking about a
few days ago. It's is a little loud, but it'll do for the time being. I
still have to get the longer tail pipe for it, since the previous one
was a bug muffler, but that can wait for the time being. Now, the
question at hand is Why do I have to jump up and down on my brake peddle
for me to stop. Just to recap, the bus was improperly stored in a dank
garage for about 6 years. I've spent the past 7 months or so working on
it. It now runs and is to the point of finally passing inspection. Back
to the brakes, it will stop, but an insane amount of pressure needs to
be applied to make it stop. Also, underneath, butted up against the
master cylinder, there is a UFO shaped thing that I can only assume is
the vacuum advance. Is there supposed to be a pin sized hole in it that
you can hear and feel a lot of suction coming from? I did search the
archive and the library with no luck. Please help if you can. Also, I
asked last time if anyone knew a good source for carpet underpadding for
a 71' microbus, mine literally melted away from mildew.

Thank you,
Nate
