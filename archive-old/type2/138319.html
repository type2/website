&lt;&lt; So far, about $7K.  $500 for brakes and engine to get it drivable, $4500
to Kelly for sheet metal repair and rust removal, then $2000 to Mark, so
far, for final body work and paint.  I figure at least another $1-2K to
Mark before the body's done, then another grand or two for oddments in
finishing it up.  If I get it done for less than $10,000, I will (a) be
ahead of the game and (b) still be less than half the price of a new
mini-van for a new (and *far* more desirable) minivan :-)

on the up side of the inverted bell curve that cars go thru' in terms
of value... ;-)
