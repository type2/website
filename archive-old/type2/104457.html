Subject: Re: [T2] Re:Lack of Confidence in Van

An old fellow told me that the dropped seat problem with aircooled engines 
in general - VW and Corvairs specifically - is caused by someone in the 
past 30 years running down the road with a hot (normal) engine and then 
shutting it off (gas stop or food stop or whatever) when they should idle 
it or slow down on the highway a bit to allow the engine to cool before 
they turn it off.

I am making some assumptions here next - can anyone set me straight - is it 
because the steel in the seat expands more than the aluminum causing it to 
enlarge the hole that the seat sets in so that eventually after a few hot 
stops the seat gets loose and causes problems?

FWIW I have been driving VW's for over 10 years now - Beetles and Busses - 
and have never had a seat drop, nor any other Type IV problem. I had a 
1200cc Beetle engine pull a head stud in normal use though. My bus 
currently has 180K miles on it but I do not know how many miles it has on 
the heads. We rebuilt the engine itself about 25K miles back.
