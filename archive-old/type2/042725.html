Subject: Re: hot starting

FWIW:
My VW guru here in Montana told me when I asked about my perceived starting
problem was &quot;they all do that when they're hot, just keep the pedal floored til
she starts&quot;.
With that in mind, if my vehicles start after 3 - 5 seconds of cranking when hot
I consider it normal and don't fix what ain't broke.
