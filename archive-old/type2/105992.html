Thanks for the vacuum suggestions - I'll check the brake booster
connection first thing tomorrow morning. 

What is the preferred method for blocking the brake booster vacuum
connection?

I do not have these lines between the carbs, as my carbs are 36-38PDSIT
(I believe - I am at work) that have been widened to 40mm with short
manifolds and no balancing lines in between.

Kinda sounds like a vacuum leak I had... down just
above the tin towards the back (towards the front of
the bus) you will feel a metal line approx 1/2&quot;. On
both sides of the engine you will feel a rubber elbow
very close to the tin. The elbows crack and leak and
you realy cant see them you have to reach down and
back and find them by feel. I have had one go bad and
one pop off over the years.. each time the bus will
not idle but I can keep it running if I keep the revs
up.... Cant remember what the h*ll its called tho.
