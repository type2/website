Subject: RE: [T2] Air scoop cover OEM

Yea, it really never gets that cold here for any length of time. I am not
sure what I will do with this kit, but you never know where I might end up
at. It was cheap, so I picked one up. I had never seen one before, but now I
see them on Ebay a lot.

I doubt it would ever get cold enough in VA., for a long enough time to
ever use these-----

Now if you lived in the &quot;land of eternal cold&quot; ( Minnesota ) where the
temps can drop to -50 for days on end--yea, they could be worth your
while---

Later
