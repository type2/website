Subject: What's a VW worth?

Hello all:

The sad time may have come that I must sell my bus. Not known just yet, but 
the possibility has arisen. The question is: How does one determine fair 
market value?

The details: '72 Westfalia, in pristine restored condition, new paint job two 
years ago, garaged for the past 10 years, used during summers only, 144,000 
miles, with a top-half rebuild at 85,000 miles. Lovingly cared for, etc. The 
blemishes: The engine drips a little oil; the gas tank stinks on turns when 
the tank is full.

So what's it worth? This figure will help me make decisions on other things.

Thanks for your input.

Tim T.
