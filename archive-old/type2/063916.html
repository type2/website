Subject: split screen bus chassis serial no.'s.

I was wondering if anyone could send me some details about split screen bus
chassis serial no.'s. Some of you might have heard about the split screens
the Swiss Army is still(?) selling off every now and then. A friend of mine
owes me a favour and does business in Switzerland every once in a while. I
asked him to go and have a look and see IF and WHAT is still available. As I
would prefer the most recent type of split screen bus (I think it is the
best for regular use), I have to know what format the chassis numbers are so
that I can determine the type and model year. Can anyone help me out? Please
do not send addresses for web pages, as I have to go to the University to
get to that. I can only log into the e-mail server from home.

Thanks in advance,
