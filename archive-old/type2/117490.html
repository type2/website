they shouldn't bother you, if you follow the instructions on how to set

no you cannot just drop solid lifters in, there are different cam
followers and they would have to be changed also, and I have been told
that you have to split the case to put in those kinds of cam followers,
hyd can just be dropped in.  also VW specs a different cam but I have
heard many folks use the same cam. 

in my opinion it would be easier to learn the hyd lifters and enjoy not
having to futz with em,  then spend some time checking your engine for
lean buurning or running hot or exhaust leaks as these are more likely to
cause burned valves

good luck
