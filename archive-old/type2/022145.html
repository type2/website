&gt;Dear Folks-
&gt;		I installed a new degree pully on my 1600 dp and when I installed it
&gt;and put on the belt I found out it was loose.  So I shimmed it and
&gt;shimmed it again and cannot get the belt tight.  right now I have it as
&gt;tight as I can and there are no shims inbetween the generator wheel.  Is
&gt;there any sugestions on how I can get this belt tight?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance

&gt;Chuck,
Are you sure you have a stock size degree pulley, or is it a &quot;power pulley&quot;?
If it is the latter, it is smaller in diameter than stock, and needs a
special size 
belt.  It will also slow down your fan and may cause cooling problems.  I
STRONGLY recommend a stock size pulley, degree or stock!
Good luck.
Pat
