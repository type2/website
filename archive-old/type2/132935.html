&gt; And for the uninitiated... they will also fit 1970 buses.  Modifications
&gt; necessary may include brake line changes(if you upgrade to the vacuum
&gt; boosted braking system)/steering box bracket relocation(unless you plan to
&gt; upgrade from the peg-and-roller steering to the later version).  I believe
&gt; the '68 transporter(not the NCC-1701 version, B.T.W.) has a different
&gt; location for its beam mounting holes.  Is '69 the same as '70?  I bought one
&gt; of Ron's beams from the last round of sales, and I'm looking forward to a
&gt; tight, new suspension/brakes/steering again!

I put what was believed to be a '70 beam on my '69 an age or two ago
without issue.
