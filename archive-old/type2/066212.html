The '57/'58 westy I'm looking at has a rear facing seat and a forward
facing seat (which I assume somehow fold out to make bunks) with a
fold-down table between them from the drivers' side wall... it has a a
floor to ceiling cabinet on the passenger side aft of the cargo doors
with a round front corner, has a small cabinet/shelf unit on the rear
cargo door and a small fold-down table on the front cargo door...

        has pop-out windows on the drivers' side( 3 in number)has the s-shaped
curtain rods on all three and on both on the cargo doors, has a side to
side curtain rod just below the fan outlet right at the partion with
3/4&quot;-1&quot; curtain rings

        Interior upholstery is a light brown and tan plaid

        still waiting for salvage yard owner to move enough cars out of the
way, so I can bring it home before it snows...so at this point I don't
know if I'm going to try and restore her...the early 23 window next to
her(1' &amp; 1/2' away) is way to far gone...parts only ( but it does have
the corner window jail-bars...  ;&gt;    )


                I'm told this is representative the 50's era Westies..
