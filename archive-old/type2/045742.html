 What size engine do you have?? Did that use to be a truck camper?? Are hills your worst enemy?? Let me know. Technically, you can cut any VW bus off at that point, and attach a camper to the rear?? If you also have water tanks, LPG tanks, grey water/black water holding tanks, how do you manage with all that weight??
I once saw a VW bug with a camper attached. Does anyone know if that was made by a company, or custom made by the owner???
