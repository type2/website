&gt; I had my aircooled 82 Westie up on jack stands working on the exhaust and
&gt; noticed that the passenger-side rear wheel turned less freely than the
&gt; driver's side wheel. Closer inspection reveals a sort-of grinding sound at
&gt; some points in wheel rotation. So, I figured that the right rear wheel
&gt; bearings were going bad and needed a replacement.

&gt; 
&gt;                         Regards,
&gt;

my advice would be to leave it alone; Drum brakes, in my experience,
will
sometimes drag just a little bit.  The noise you are hearing sounds more
like the brakes contacting the brake drum.
 
Does the axle have any side to side play? Does it feel rough when you
turn it by hand?
Bearing problems will occur (usually) when the endplay is out of wack or
when the rollers
pit.  They will &quot;crackle&quot;.  Since the rollers are small compared to the
diameter of the overall
bearing, they will have a rotational velocity several times that of the
outer bearing housing,
so the noise will be at higher frequency than the wheel rotation. (wow,
what a run on!)
 
A brake noise would occur at teh same frequency and phase with each
wheel rotation. 
 
You may very well have a problem; just be aware that the noise may be
normal drum
brake adjustment.
 
I'm sure others will have other opinons; this is just based on my
experience, which isn't remarkable,
and what I remember from attending classes (again, not remarkable ;)  )

good luck
