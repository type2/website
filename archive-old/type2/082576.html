Subject: racing buses on dirt

hello all,

just something i was thinking about.

i think it would be cool, and i'm very interested in
trying to do it. no campers, of course, that would
just be foolish (I think). i'm thinkin i would
probably just get a regular bay, strip down the
interior. install two roll bars. one right behind the
front seats, and one in the rear, where the bench seat
used to be. probably some sway bars too, and decent
tires. which BTW does anyone know of a link for some
decent dirt racing tires? 

i think that if it got big enough you would want to
have it divided into classes of Type 1 &amp; Type 4
engines. maybe racers could even hook sponsors,
someday. 

just a thought, but one i would like to pursue. any
thoughts or insights would be greatly appreciated.
does this even remotely interest anyone else? even
just as a spectator? does this sort of thing go on
presently? if so where?

ok thats it for now, thanks in advance for any replys.
