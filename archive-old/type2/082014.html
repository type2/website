Subject: Re: [T2] 81 Vanagon

Your talking about a vehicle that is 20+ years old (probably mfg in 80).
Nothing else to go wrong?????  I suppose if it was meticulously maintained
and you performed meticulous maintenance...  I'd think long and hard if you
aren't into it as a hobby/passion.  Just my $0.02 worth.

Peace,
Bill

Subject: [T2] 81 Vanagon


&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; I bought an 81 Vanagon a couple of years ago.  It does not run and was
told
&gt; it needs a new engine.  I would like to have the engine rebuilt.  I love
it
&gt; and especially am looking forward to camping.  However is it smart for me
to
&gt; put money into this being that I have no mechanical experience?   Many
people
&gt; are trying to talk me out of this.  But I am hoping for a rebuilt engine
and
&gt; then nothing else to go wrong.  Any advise would be great.  Also, any
&gt; recommendations for a VW mechanic in Northern Idaho.  Thank you.
&gt;
