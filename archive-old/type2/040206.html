Subject: RE Seat Belts

I fitted a standard lap belt from a large auto uk auto chain (Halfords) in
the centre of my bus - works fine.  I also use a full harness type thing
that slides over the belt, it has 2 belts that go up over the passangers
shoulders and are ancored to an eye bolt fitted in the parcel shelf at the
rear of the van. I got that from Halfords too.  The non-kitchen unit side of
the van uses the existing mounts for a 3 point belt (standard from
Halfords).
I am planning a full width seat (Child 3 has now arrived) when I finish the
restoration, so I will need to visit Halfords again.
