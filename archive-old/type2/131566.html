Subject: Distributor Orientation

I posted a while back about the orientation of the .009. I have since done 
away with it. Now I am installing the 205P and the condesor is hitting the 
tin, in the position that seems correct to me. That being the number one 
wire being at the rear(RIR) and to the right. Am I correct?  I am looking 
for pics and have not found any yet anybody have any?

For the time being, I will be plugging away.
