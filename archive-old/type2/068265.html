Subject: Re: Split bus headlight rims

Thanks for all the replies people.

I am 94% (approx.) sure they are bus headlights. They
have the little drain hole in the right place for a bus. I
don't think this is a home-made bug-bus conversion
thing -- they are &amp; look NOS &amp; unmodified. (&amp; they have
a Bosch stamp)

Is it a late/early split thing maybe? Can I modify my
existing adjusters, or do I need new adjusters for these
surrounds?
