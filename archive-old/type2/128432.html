&gt; Ok, this is odd. Greg's bus should not run with the afm plug

If what you say is right, Scott (and I suspect that it is), then the 
unplugged idle should cease if Greg clamps both ends of the fuel ring. 
Unclamping each end while leaving the other clamp may provide a clue 
about what's going on.

But even more important, this would a good, simple, first-level test to 
check whether the fuel ring is sealed: unplug the AFM and see if it 
starts and idles.
