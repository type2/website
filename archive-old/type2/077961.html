Subject: Living out of a Bus....HELP!

Hey all.

Here's the deal:
I took off a semester from college for travel and I'm
back now, with school not starting til January. I plan
on parking and living out of my 70' Bus...and it's
nothing but a loaf; stripped of sink, stove and
all...November and December. Bad months to do this,
huh? I'm in Texas so it's not as bad as it could be,
but it'll still drop below freezing time and again.
I'm looking for any wisdom, experience and product
endorsements all of you well traveled and seasoned
life-veterans can impart.
Main consideration will be electricity, I'm assuming.
Lights for sure, but I'd like to run a little TV/VCR
combo to entertain peoples every now-and-again...and a
blender sure wouldn't hurt. Century makes a nice
little 'Electri-pac&quot; that's only $99 but it's also
only 300 watts. I was going to buy a little portable
electric ac/dc generator...600 watts at about $189.
Good call, or am I a fool? What about if I simply
bought a good size (I don't even know what that would
be) deep cycle 12v RV battery and hooked up an
inverter of an appropriate size which y'all suggest?
This would be in addition to the installed battery. I
could leave the whole thing outside, cover it and run
a cord to the outside wall outlet of The Bus, huh? If
I did this would it be worth gettin' a solar panel
charger to limit the runs to a nearby buddy's house
for a recharge?
I've used a Coleman Black Cat catalytic heater (about
$70) in roomy boat cabins with good results. What
about for The Bus, am I a dreamer? Also, what about an
electric space heater plugged into whatever electric
system I end up with.
For a bit more room I'm getting just a separate
screened-in 13 x 9 canopy ($38 _at_ Wal-mart). I just
don't think I have the bread for a VW tent. Would it
be worth it to spring for a cheap one?

Well, at the risk of writing too much, I threw out
most all my questions and fears in this email. Thanks
for putting up with the length.
I'm very much looking forward to y'alls insightful
replies.

Thanks in advance,
Foustus-Bohemian
