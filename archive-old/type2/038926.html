Subject: 72 Headlights don't work or I can only drive in the daylight

The headlights stopped working and I can not figure out what the problem
should be?  The parking lights work and the fuse is good and I swear that it
is the mechanism that shuts the headlights off when you turn the key off but
leaves the parking light on (so you don't wear down your battery)  How does
this work and is it repairable or should I look for a new ignition switch
(if that is where the turn off feature is located?)
