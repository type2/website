&lt;&lt; Take a medium-small sized heavily insulated cooler (6 or 12 pack 
size?), possibly one of the new ones that have a DC powered cooling plate?  
Install a cheap 6-8 pass transmission/oil/or motorcycle radiator block style 
cooler on the lid.  Mount one or two 12V high output computer case fans (or 
DC car fans of some sort) either right on the radiator, or at one end of a 
custom housing to force the air through the radiator.  Run vinyl or silicone 
tubing from the radiator through holes in the lid (sealed around edges with 
expanda-foam), one for intake, one for return.  buy a cheap aquarium or 
marine bilge pump that runs on 12V DC and use that to circulate the cold 
water through the radiator.  &gt;&gt;

That DC cooling plate is gonna heat the bus (ask Maxwell's Imp ;-)
I tend to think that there just isn't enough mass in the ice to cool
much. Try an experiment...Fill the cooler with ice and put it in a
closed bus with a thermostat hanging from something. Leave the
cooler open and see if the temperature of the interior goes down 
by much...
