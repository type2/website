Subject: Re: [T2] Hot engine = No start

Is it just a sign on the starter
&gt;getting old?

The same thing happened on my bus. It was the starter for sure, it would 
start fine in the mornings but have a hard time starting when warm. Replaced 
the starter with a new Bosche starter and it's been fine ever since.
