Subject: Air Conditioning in the Bus

Hey guys,

	I'm just curious what kind of set-up most of you guys have in your
Transporters as far as air conditioning goes. To me personally, I'm not
really concerned about air conditioning. But everyone else that would ever
ride with me would make a big deal about it. I found recently, an A/C
compressor (that isn't siezed by the way) WITH a mounting bracket to attach
it to a Volkswagen flat-4. I actually pulled it off of a VW Bus.. like a 74
or something. In any case, I was thinking about using it, but then it
occured to me that it would probably rob a LOT of power from the motor.. as
well as heat it up.

Well, in an attempt to fix my fiance's 1 year old washing machine, I decided
to just cannabolize it for parts. I pulled out a water pump, and a basically
brand new motor with a V-belt pulley attached to it. It got me thinking...
would it be possible to hook up this motor to the A/C compressor... either
directly (by welding the pulleys together) or by attaching a small V-belt to
them? Would the alternator be able to supply enough electricity to the
compressor as well? 

Any thoughts, ideas?


Thanks!
