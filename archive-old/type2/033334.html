Subject: Re: for those with non-vw engines

&gt;I also have a subaru engine out and ready to bolt in
&gt; with the correct kennedy adapters.  i would like to
&gt; hear from those of you who have used a sooby motor
&gt;in a bus. should be a brainless swap
  
Please keep us up date of your conversion. I post a
similar question few weeks ago and I been doing some
research and I narrowed down to few engines. Now is
time to decide and go with the best. Mazda RX7, Subaru
or a Golf 2L. My engine in my 69' only have like 7,XXX
miles but I am looking for something different,
reliable and more power without scarify fuel economy.
(next summer project) I am also looking to hide the
radiator the best I can. I seem the Toyota conversion
with the radiator under the cargo floor in an angle
with baffle to direct the air. (You wont notice
anything) I also saw what I call a sleeper. A 1960
white wall &quot;vintage type I&quot; with a RX7 13b rotary. He
install a bracket with the original muffler tips, hide
and paint the working muffler black. You won't notice
a thing. He dont even have a tach, just a flower vase.
Now are you going to install a Carb or FI? All the
conversions I research has carb but I wonder how
difficult would be to have FI (brain box &amp; electric
fuel pump). Would it be wort it?
