Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for the air hose to make my wiper washer work

Adam,

I don't think your nuts,, Just because I have never seen one doesn't mean it
doesn't exist,,,
Like I said in my original reply,, a bicycle tire air pump...

You can put air pressure in the windshield washer fluid bottle using any air
source, most people use the gas station air compressor, or a portable 12v air
compressor, or a bicycle tire air pump...

If you are creative, you could use the parts from a bug to make a longer air
transfer hose... make sure the valves are working simply by attaching to a spare
and letting the air out, when it stops, check the tire pressure, should be about
22psi.  get a longer tube from your FLAPS, remove the 2 ends from the original
Beetle one, and put them in the longer tube,, then you probably know to pump the
tire up to about 45psi... and the valve will automatically stop transferring air
to the bottle at about 22 psi, so you never end up with a flat spare.

 some convert this Bus system to an electric pump by popping the lines off the
valve in the steering column and putting them on a universal electric washer
fluid pump that is available at FLAPS. Then install a small electric pushbutton
switch on the dash...an added side bonus,, no more wet crotch when the valve
leaks

Let us know what you find out.
Cheers!
Jamie ,, converted my system to electric,, then found out about RAIN-X and never
used the wipers or washers in the last 3 years

Ps... are gas station air pumps $0.50 in USA Tony??  Wow! we pay a canadian
quarter and complain! 50cents USA is like a million dollars here now!

&gt; &lt;&lt; How do transporters get air pressure for the window washer?   If not from

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From the 50 cent (&quot;...remember when gas stations had free air, etc.&quot;) air
&gt; pump. You could also rig a generic pump into the bottle. I understand the
&gt; cheapness of using the spare on a Bug as the source of pressure, but I
&gt; could also see a long dusty/muddy road and a flat spare at its end...
