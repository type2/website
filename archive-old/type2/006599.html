Same story in Oregon.

Some are happy to let you pump if you want, although by law it's verboten.

Some will buy the &quot;potential damage and/or fuel spill&quot; story and,
reluctantly, let you pump your own fuel.

Many [most?] will only sell you fuel if they do the pumping, and can be
quite belligerent about the whole process.

Our usual solution is to top off the tank at the last opportunity before
crossing into Oregon.  We then attempt to refuel as needed at relatively
off-the-beaten-path stations where the proprietors seem likely to have a
live and let live approach to such foolishness :-)

FWIW.....
