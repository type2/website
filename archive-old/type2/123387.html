Subject: Re: [T2] STEEL DASH?

Hi List,

George is completely right here. The dashes are universal. However you do
need the padding above the dashboard. This includes the handle for the
passenger and a straight piece of padding above the instrument panel. The
following picture clarifies what i mean. Look at www.vct2.nl/dashboard.jpg
for a naked dashboard. This picture was taken in a Type2 fire truck from
1968.

It should also be possible to get rid of the padding but there will be alot
of glue to be cleaned off the metal surface.

Is there a difference between the LHD and RHD dash?  It seems that the
glove box and instrument panel would simply swap.  You'd have to make a
few holes for switches, but other than that they seem symmetrical.
