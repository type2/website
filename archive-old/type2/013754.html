I've had good service out of the economical Cooper SRM
II (or Mastercraft Courser R/D twin) in 185R14
reinforced.  I've also used 195R14 reinforced on a
vanagon and it actually made the speedometer correct. 
(It was off with the 185's that the manuals say is
correct.)

Do not let them talk you into buying some 185-205/14
passenger tire.  Your bus will wallow like a boat
without the reinforced tires and it's probably not
safe to boot!

Good luck,
Das Kapitan
