&lt;&lt; I have an oil leak coming from the oil pressure switch. By the way of 
 replacing this oil pressure swith, i would like to put a VDO oil pressure 
 sender and a VDO gauge. I want tot put a sender who can light the 
 original oil pressure light in the dash. &gt;&gt;

You need the dual VDO oil pressure sender and the remote locator kit.  I
bought the sender from The Bus Depot, but they don't carry the remote kit, so
I bought it from Bus Boys.

The dual sender has 2 connections on the top, 1 for the gauge, and the other
for the dash light.
