&gt; - How can you tell if a transaxle CV joint boot (not sure if this
&gt; is VW lingo ... my father said this is what they were called when he
&gt; worked on them) is bad and/or needs to be replaced?  The boot on the right
&gt; side of the bus was cracked and we fear that it will lose grease soon.  Is
&gt; it a major problem to replace these?  If labor is the main thing then I'm
&gt; not incredibly worried ... money is the main issue.


If it's cracked fix it. It is much cheaper to get a new boot now (about $25
for all 4 with clamps) than a new CV later (about $175 (or more) for all 4).
To test the other ones you can squeeze them and look for cracks.... It
wouldn't hurt to replace all 4 boots as well as check your CV's (especially
the balls and cage) for pitting and re-grease them.

&gt; - We found that the cooling system had been removed from the
&gt; engine - there aren't any flaps, linkages, cables or a thermostat.  How
&gt; much difficulty is it to replace all of this, and are the parts available?
&gt; We just glanced in &quot;The Bus Depot&quot; catalog and didn't see the necessary
&gt; parts ... are there resources for this type of thing?  And would I have
&gt; problems this winter if I don't fix it?

Actually it is more of a heating system than cooling, however the left flap
does direct some air through the oil cooler... you can find the thermostat
but you are probably going to have to go junk yard digging for the flaps (if
anyone knows where to get them I am needing a set as well). You may have
problems getting the engine to warm up during the winter (depending on where
you live).  Now that I think about it your engine is different than mine so
the flaps may not be as necessary on yours as on my 2 Lire. But they were
put there for a reason so I'd find some.

&gt; - How do we set the timing for the engine?  We assumed that there
&gt; would be a cap in the fan belt housing unit, so that we could make the
&gt; adjustment ... but, we didn't see one.  We have been using a few books for
&gt; this rebuild, and each book suggested that we would find this cap, but we
&gt; didn't.  Is this strange?

I'm not familiar with that year engine... but try the archives.

&gt; - And last - but not least - what is the best solvent for cleaning
&gt; and degreasing the engine parts?  We don't want a water based cleanser,
&gt; for fear of rusting, but don't want to use something like gasoline, for
&gt; obvious reasons.

Parrafin (Kerosine), and Mineral Spirits work well but not much better for
your blood stream than gas. (Have fun with those CV joints... heh heh heh :)

 Hope this helps...  if I'm wrong on any of this the old timers  :) will be
sure to correct me (I'm pretty new as well).  Spend a few hours in the
archives... theres a lot of good stuff in there.
