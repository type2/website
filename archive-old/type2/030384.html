Volk,

We recently crossed the 900 member line, which means that traffic is
increasing slowly but steadily.  To keep the roar down to a reasonable
level, I ask, please, that we exersize a tiny bit of self-discipline.  
Now, I know that discipline comes as naturally to the average VW driver
(including myself :), as balooning comes to dolphins, but...

While there is nothing wrong with surveys, I would encourage those of you
who want to conduct one to include a line on the order of:

&quot;Please respond to me.  I will collate the responses and forward them to
the list.&quot;

And I would further urge those of you who respond to respond to the
originator of the survey without cc'ing the list. In this case, respond to
John (John Hartranft &lt;jhartan_at_tir_dot_com&gt;) and, John, this Friday you let us
all know what everyone thinks.

If this cause unbearable heartburn, please let me know.

                           H Steven Dolan
			   Administrator, type2 list
