Subject: Re: [T2] starting prob - no key...

Ok this totally makes sense. I just want to adjust valves and see if this 
puppy can run, then get it warm and check compression, then drop and work on 
for my Westy. I like it, seems I can totally get it to run for this with 
just some wire, then come back to this bus and give it an igintion later on.

Thanks, appreciate the help.

&gt;1. Make a &quot;remote starter switch&quot; pushbutton switch normally open with one
&gt;wire to the &quot;little wire&quot; on the starter and the other wire to battery &quot;+&quot;
&gt;
&gt;2. Make a jumper with at least 12 gauge wire and run it from battery &quot;+&quot; to
&gt;the &quot;+&quot; side of the coil. This part acts like turning the key switch to the
&gt;&quot;run&quot; position.
