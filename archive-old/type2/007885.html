This is one reason to buy the one from Barney's.  I had one in a previous
bus.  It worked through two Canadian winters without complaining.  It is
$70 I think but you won't have to replace it after a year and you get all
the parts you'll need.  It has a three speed fan that flows about 140 cfm
on high if my memory serves correctly.  Quiet too.  The three speed fan is
essential in my opinion.  You WILL roast without slower speeds.  That's
assuming your heater boxes aren't leaking like crazy.

Later,
Clark
