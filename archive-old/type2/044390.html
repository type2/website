&gt; With all due respect, I am confident that removing tin will increase my
&gt; engine temp.

This was my entire point. Fluids (air) flow from higher pressure to lower
pressure. The fact that the engine will heat up says something about
pressures.

I'm not bent about it, let's remain friends! :-)
