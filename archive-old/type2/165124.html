Subject: Crankshaft Pulley Puller 1600cc

Hello again, I am wondering if anyone knows a source for a crankshaft
pulley puller that will work with the engine in the car and without
removing any tin? I am not talking about the one that grabs the outer
edge and usually bends the pulley (if it works at all). A mechanic
friend had one years ago that had a round foot that fit the end of the
crankshaft and claws that used the stock holes in the pulley. It was
very low profile, looked like it was designed for VWs only. I have not
seen one like it since. This is for another friends Bug, or I would just
pull the tin. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks, Timo
