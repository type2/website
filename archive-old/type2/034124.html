Subject: Re: [VB] Valve Adjustment :-)

dunno if anyone has said it yet as I haven't been following the thread...but have any of you ever looked at the valve adjustment sticker on your fan shroud...or
the sticker that WAS there?  They say .004.  that is DM.  VWoA changed it to .006 for us lazy americans since &quot;we&quot; never set our valves and everything at 3K
miles.  so they did this in hopes of prolonging engine life.  I run mine at a happy .005 :)
