Subject: Interior paint

I've been noticing (hadn't noticed before) that buses with white paint 
from the waist up tend to have white paint throughout the interior. 
whereas buses with a solid color outside have the same color inside. Is 
this the way they were from new? What about buses with two-color 
schemes, where one color is not white?
