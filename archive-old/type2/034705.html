Subject: fitting BA6 heater to bus

Howdy,

I have an old Eberspaecher BA6 that I would like to install under my '75
bus. The main, heavy, part of the heater has three brackets with rubber
bushings at their ends, but it's not obvious to me how they are supposed to
attach to the undercarriage. They do not seem to line up with any cross
member.  Any suggestions, in particular from the Canadian contingent (whose
busses came with those heaters pre-installed)?

Btw, I'm also in search for a &quot;belly pan, a long, wide section of pressed
sheet metal that runs from the gas tank to the transmission and between the
frame rails&quot; (quote from Jack Reed).

TIA,

Sami
