Quoth the Raven...

Yes, death is extreme, and it happens every day on the road. Next to
drunks,
I would venture to guess that lack of inspections causes the next most

You have to be kidding. Next to drunks Im pretty sure bad or stupid
driving causes most of the serious accidents. Id venture to say that
maintenance
problems cause a very small portion
of them.
