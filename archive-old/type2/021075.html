Eric,

Where are you located?  What model year is your VW?  


If you happen to live near the beach, take a look at some
20-30' sailboats.  The interiors are pretty efficient at using
the available interior space.  Most boats use 12V for the
accessories.  Some have alcohol stoves and a toilet (head).

You may discover alot of ideas for your own &quot;land yacht&quot;.

Best of luck,
