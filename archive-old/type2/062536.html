&gt;'Lo all:
&gt;I'm in a quandry about rebuilding my carb. It's not the building that 
&gt;troubles me, it's he cleaning. After you soak the carb, you're supposed to

&gt;blow out all the passages with compressed air. Problem is, you guessed it,
I 
&gt;have no air compressor. And I don't think it would be fiscally advisable
to 
&gt;buy one to rebuild my carb. Any thoughts? Does anyone sell cans of 
&gt;compressed air?

Try a camera store -- they should have canned compressed air for cleaning
lenses, etc.  Good luck!
