Input please.  I found a 78 Westy for sale in my town.  Here are the details
as I know them.

New engine block (2lt) 2 years old with 6,000 miles (verified by the
mechanic that installed, and by receipt), gas tanks professionally cleaned
(removed 1 pint of tar and rust according to receipt), 4 tires with good
tread, not sure of the tire rating, new clutch plates and cable, brakes need
work, pedal goes almost to the  floor, pumping helps alot, under dash air
cond works and
blows pretty darn cold, 4 speed shifted easy and had good pick up and speed.

Looks:

Exorcist vomit green ppears origional but found some
yellow to a manilla color under a rear side light, may be a repaired area ,
rust on lower
panel at battery heavy bubbles but not thru paint yet and one spot the size
of a half dollar at front corner of slideing door. Westy top not frayed or
cracked.

Canvas one tiny tear, not too musty either. Upholstery on the beds and
cushions are excellent, no runs, rips or tears.  Front seats certianly used
but no tears or excess wear. Dash and a/c unit clean and all there. Even the
origonal  carpet was very clean.

I currently drive a 71 7 passenger bus ( Thanks to Rev Dave and  Scott in
Mobile) in excellent condition .  Never played with the bigger engines, but
I dont do much work on them anyhow (Not enough time, and I would rather
drive them then work them ).

He is asking $5,000  negotiable.  Extras like the bike rack, 9&quot;TV, Tiny
microwave, fans etc may or maynot be part of the deal.

Thoughts, comments, or reactions from the mighty list?

P-mail if you like.  TIA
