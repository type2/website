Hi. This is the qmail-send program at ns.bweebhosting_dot_com.
I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following
addresses. This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work
out.

&gt; Chuck,
&gt;
&gt; Vacuum leak...check all hoses.
&gt;
&gt; Make sure *all* electrical is up to specs first(dwell/timing).
&gt;
&gt; Check all fi connectors...especially the temperature sensor(tight?)
&gt;
&gt; More after checking all of those...
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, dave
&gt; --

Got it. I will get under the hood tomorrow morning.

I gave it a cursory check and found nothing, but I did not check the temp
sensor II.... I can dig out some diagnostic equipment if it isn't
something obvious.

It went to hell really quickly, like in less than 100 miles, so it
probably is some loose hose...

thanks
Chuck
