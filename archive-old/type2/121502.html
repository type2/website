Subject: Re: [T2] Heat: Atwood Bilge Blower?

&gt;I do not know the CFM's of the engine itself so don't know if a bilge blower
&gt;could overtake the engine fan.  Anyone???

On the type 4 engine there are 4 flappers that control air flow at the 
fans. This does not include the flappers at the heater boxes or up front 
anywhere or the engine warmup thermostatically controlled flappers..

There are two flappers in the aux fan housing. They open when the aux fan 
is pushing more air than the engine fan. They are plastic and tend to warp 
and fall out with age.

There are two more flappers at the base of the type 4 fan housing. They are 
aluminum. They open at anything above a fast idle when the engine fan 
output overtakes the aux fan output.

At idle: aux fan is pushing more air than engine fan. Aux flappers open, 
engine fan flappers closed.

At some speed above idle: engine fan is pushing more air so engine fan 
flappers open, aux fan flappers closed.

If you increase the output of the aux fan, the engine flappers stay closed 
more often. Without the aux fan flappers and engine fan flappers in working 
order air will not move forward through the heaters to cabin and heater 
output will be poor b/c air will leak backwards through aux fan or engine 
fan...

Simple system but the flappers have to be free to move, not warped or bent.

I too would love to hear some CFM numbers for the two fans and the Atwood...
