Rent a car dolly, they work great.
Remove the gearbox side of your drive axles and put heavy freezer bags
over the ends to keep your CVs clean and tie the bags on securely with
wire or use Duct Tape. Tie the axles up close to the frame with steel
wire (not electrical copper) you can travel faster and most car dollys
have brakes and thats a big help.

&gt; Hi, I recently bought a 74 Riviera in Juarez, Mexico. I live in 
&gt; Colorado.
&gt; I have driven the van while I was down there and it &quot;seems&quot; to run 
&gt; fine. I
&gt; have to go down and pick it up soon but i have a dilemma.
&gt; 
&gt; The more I research the things (this is my first aircooled VW) the 
&gt; more I
&gt; find out how easy it is to fry the engine. Since I won't have time 
&gt; to
&gt; check the valves and other &quot;crucial things&quot; while I am down there, 
&gt; would
&gt; it be much wiser for me to pull it on the 10 hour (probably 15 with 
&gt; the
&gt; bus) journey back to where I live. Or, if I check the oil and drive 
&gt; it
&gt; like a baby back, would that be ok. Thanks ahead for the advice!
