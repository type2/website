	While picking up a new engine mount at a shop on Cape Cod
(Massachusetts- Bugs, Busses &amp; Things), and talking to the owner about my
engine that I'm rebuilding, he mentioned that the heads should have new
seats put in them and that no one locally does it, therefore my *just
re-built* heads are not likely to have new seats. He gets his heads at
Mark Stephens which I would do, if I had not just paid to re-build my
heads.  Since they are on the engine, it's kinda hard to tell if they
have new seats. He said that with a lot of miles on the heads (151,000 on
van) that I should have new seats for the 5,000 mile trip to Wyoming I'm
planning. 
	Is a VW engine (81 Type IV-Vanagon) more likely to drop a seat
because it has seen a lot of miles? And if so - Why? One of the heads is
fairly new from VW (by P.O) so it's OK, but I don't know about the other.
 Now I'm worried (especially since I'm probalby running 7.4 : 1 C.R. -
also advised against) about dropping a seat on the Westy as My wife and
two young children watch dad screw up their biggest trip ever.
	He also recommended leaving the thermostatically controlled flaps
out of the engine to flow more cooling air or trying them open to ensure
they are never stuck close? Comments-Advise-Please!
