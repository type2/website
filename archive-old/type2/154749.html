Subject: Re: [T2] tuneups and gas mileage. - 77 Westy

Besides the engine RPM to miles travelled ratio you have the time the engine is running versus actually being driven to consider, I have been getting less miles to a tank because of the 5+ minutes my bus sits running every morning warming up before I leave for work, in reality I am not getting worse mileage, but I am driving less miles per tank of gas.

&gt; If you aren't spending much time in 4th gear then the engine is 
&gt; turning more revs per mile travelled. That is also gonna hurt your 
&gt; milage.
