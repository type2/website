Subject: gasoline leak ignition sources

From: &quot;TR Gesell&quot; &lt;trgesell_at_compuserve_dot_com&gt;
&gt;Subject: RE: [T2] almost up in smoke
&gt;
&gt;Glad it turned out well; I had a gas leak recently  For future reference, the only
ignition sources in the bus &gt;that are hot enough to ignite gasoline are electrical
sparks and hot exhaust leaks. Once you have the
&gt;vehicle shut off (including all electrical accessories) all you have to worry about is
cleaning up the mess.

ggm responds,

with open pools of gasoline, you also have to worry about an infinite number of every
other ignition source in the environment: the passing smoker flipping a cigarette into
the pool of gasoline; the guy with a flat tire running on the rim screeching to a halt
in a slew of sparks; the hot water heater gas pilot light in the RV that stops next to
you to gloat; your emphatically waving girlfriend wearing her wool sweater (static
electricity sparks) ; etc. ad infinitum. gasoline sends out vaporous fuses anxious to
ignite at the slightest whim.
