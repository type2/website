Subject: Transmission problems?
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

I just replaced the clutch cable on my 1974 VW Bus, along with that the clutch
pin that attaches the cable and the clutch peddle or however you spell the
damn word...anyways...now whenever i try to take off in first gear it pops out
of gear and when i try to throw it back in it grinds real harsh.  Do i have
transmission problems and if so, how much will this cost to fix?  I've wasted
my resources and i dont want to go to a mechanic before i hear word from
someone who really knows VW Busses and works with them every day.  Please
respond if you are qualified.

Thanks
