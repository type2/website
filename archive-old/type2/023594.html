Subject: Trip Report: Bang!
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Well I was making my maiden voyage of any distance in my newly-acquired 71 
Westy this weekend heading out to the Super Jam in Mohnton, PA. Everything 
was fine for the first 60 miles, then I heard a loud noise. Sounded like I 
ran over something metal in the road. The bus is still running...I look at 
the dash and saw the generator light come on, so I stopped. Walked around 
back, opened the engine lid, and guess what I see? The alternator (yes, alt. 
not gen.) pulley has come off and is ripped into a couple of big pieces. 
Pieces must have shot all over because one cracked my distributor cap and one 
shot out the left side of the bus making a nice hole in the body. Ouch! Belt 
was still there and intact, as was inner pulley.

Any idea what would cause this and how much trouble I'm in? The engine in a 
fairly new rebuild and I hadn't messed with the belt or pulley. Maybe I 
should have. Anyway, I had it towed to a nearby shop. Have to say that an 80s 
Vanagon passed me by, as did another 70s Westy. This was on Rt. 78 in 
Bethlehem, PA. I was kinda bothered that no one stopped, but maybe next time.
