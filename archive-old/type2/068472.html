Subject: Re: Westfalia Sticker-- where?

technically your 75' westy would not have had the big 
WESTFALIA lettering on the back of the pop top, those began 
in the 1979 model year. What you would have had is probably 
a small westfalai &quot;prnacing horse&quot; stciker on either side of 
the stattionary part of the pop top

&gt; my westfalia is a 75.  I posted yesterday that I would 
like a sticker for the
&gt; back of it (the one that goes on the pop-top, or whatever)
&gt; 
&gt; thanks..
