&gt;
&gt;'Lo all:
&gt;I'm in a quandry about rebuilding my carb. It's not the building that 
&gt;troubles me, it's he cleaning. After you soak the carb, you're supposed to 
&gt;blow out all the passages with compressed air. Problem is, you guessed it, I 
&gt;have no air compressor. And I don't think it would be fiscally advisable to 
&gt;buy one to rebuild my carb. Any thoughts? Does anyone sell cans of 
&gt;compressed air?

  You can rent an air tank at most equipment rental houses but this
do jack up the price of the rebuild. Hopefully it would have the 
proper attachment for blowing.
