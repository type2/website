Subject: Re: [T2] Oil filler gasket on a pancake engine

Snoopy,
I had the same problem on my 78 (all stock). The oil filler tube is indeed
held by two 2 bolts. There is a gasket, I bought mine from either busdepot or
busboys. I had to redo the job with generous gasket maker in addition to the
gasket to get it to seal. It can be done with the engine in but is made much
easier if you are willing to remove the rear engine support, which
necessitates that you put a temporary support under the motor. If you are
going to use some gasket maker then it is particularly important to remove
the support as it is very difficult to get the piece in place and still have
the goop where you want it.

Hope this helps.
Kindest Regards,
Chris

&gt; Also, it looks like 2 bolts to take it off and replace.  Am I correct or
&gt; will this be a big PITA?  Can it be done with the engine in?
