Subject: RE: Gauges

&gt;To me the sound of my engine running smoothly is the sweetest thing
&gt;I can hear while I am driving (even for 14 hours! :-) And if my engine &gt;is 
&gt;*not* running smoothly, well.... I want to hear that, too!


I don't disagree with you at all. I listened to the sweet cacaphony of my 
1641 for most of 6,000 miles this spring - and prefered it to the 
steady-state thump of my brain, which is one-cylinder. But where else can I 
get my Britney fix if I don't have a stereo (mono at least).
