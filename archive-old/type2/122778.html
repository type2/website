&gt;   It started as a high whine, kind of like the wind tearing past an
&gt; antenna, with a small bit of warbling here and there.  I was hoping it
&gt; was simply the speedometer cable but now Im not so sure.  Sometimes we
&gt; hear a rhythmicka-thunk ka-thunk when at low speeds.  I now suspect
&gt; were losing a bearing.  We feel no drag or pull, the brakes are
&gt; working
&gt; wonderfully, just the noise.

I would also guess a bearing.  If it's ka-thunk'ing, it may just be the
end-play.  Jack up that corner and wiggle the tire back-and-forth.  If
it seems excessive, you probably want to have it looked at.
(Unfortunately, I don't have my Bentley handy, so I can't tell you what
&quot;excessive&quot; means.)

&gt;   We lost the turn signals yesterday.  A real bummer in heavy work hour
&gt; traffic through Philadelphia.

Check for blown fuses.  I'd be surprised if your flasher relay suddenly
went out without showing other signs of failure.  You should be able to
find the appropriate replacements at any FLAPS.

&gt;   Anyhow, we are shoving off for home tomorrow.  Ill be glad to
&gt; arrive.
&gt; My cow calved today, a week early.  She is having difficulties and we
&gt; need to be there.  Glad though that she had a heifer.

Congratulations :-)
