If the outer part of the CV that is attached to the flange on the stub
axle is spinning, then the splines in your drum are gone and the CV is OK.
Your stub axle may or may not be OK, you'll have to remove the hub to
know.

If the axle is spinning, but the outer part of the CV is not, then that CV
is shot.  The boot will probably be ripped to heck too.
