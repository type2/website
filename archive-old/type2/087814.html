Jim,
    Check the AIRS list, I think there are some people listed there that are
from your neck of the woods.  They might be able to give you a better idea
of local resources.  Also try the Lower Hudson Volkswagen Association at
http://geocities_dot_com/lhva88/ or maybe the Connecticut Volkswagen
Associations at http://www.ctvwa_dot_com/
I'm sad to say that here on Long Island the only junkyard that any amount of
bus stuff closed last year.  But on the other hand we did start a local bus
club, known as the Bus Alliance which is a good resource.  You can sign up
for our e-mail list at http://groups.yahoo_dot_com/group/busalliance/ and find
out about any of our meetings and events that way, or ask bus related
questions.  Anyway, I hope you find what you need.
