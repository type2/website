All,

There's a rough-looking stretch splitty out of Phoenix
(I think) with white primer on it. I believe it had a
mid-mounted Chevy small block power-plant and *lots*
of shag carpet inside!!!

It's actually pretty cool. I've seen it at the
Prescott, Az. Flat Four Fetish show (which occurs
again, next weekend). It might be there again, so look
for it at the street-show if you go.
