&gt; I changed the bulbs in my rear lights this morning only to discover that
&gt; while the lenses are in good shape, the housings are shot.  Even a light
&gt; touch in spots can break away a chip that crumbles to dust.  Inevitably, I'm
&gt; going to need to find a pair of `77 Transporter tail light housings.
&gt; Thankfully, I was able to reassemble them in working condition.

All the original housings are doing that. In my opinion all of the
reproduction units are horrible except for the Hella made units that Bus
Depot sells.

Does anyone know if it was UV that destroyed the original housings?
