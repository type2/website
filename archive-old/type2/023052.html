&gt;The gaskets between manifold and head (both input and output manifolds) are
&gt;of a sandwich construction - two thin metal layers with a black compound in
&gt;the middle. The metal layers have a small ridge inset from the edge. The
&gt;sandwich is perhaps 2mm thick overall.
&gt;
&gt;On fitting the metal ridge is deformed and the black compound is compressed
&gt;to take up any unevenness in the fit.

That's very interesting.  The gaskets that I have seen look like they were 
cut from a single sheet of aluminum and the small ridge is just a 
deformation of the metal - definitely not sandwich construction and 
definitely no goop inside.  By strange coincidence I've had a terrible time 
in the past getting those gaskets to seal, even the first time.  They 
always had small leaks as evidenced by the WD-40 test.  I was finally able 
to get a decent seal by sanding and polishing the mating surfaces of the 
head and intake manifold.  I've seen many engines that used various types 
of silicon sealer to attempt to fix the same problem.  Now you've got me 
wondering if the root of the problem is that we've all been using 
inadequate reproduction gaskets all these years...
