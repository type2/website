Subject: Dip stick boot I found a easy way

After an hour or so of finger craps, inventing new swear words. I even tried 
KY lube no luck. Then I tried to stretch the ends with sockets IT WORKED. You 
have to be quick it doesn't take long before the rubber shrinks back to 
original size. 

Thanks everyone BW
