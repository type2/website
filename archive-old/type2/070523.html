I replaced the front spare tire mount on my '79 Westy last
weekend. I had and oddball mount that irritated me. My
original looks exactly like the replacement one I put on
except the top two studs were coarse english threads and
the bottom one was metric. It is a lot nicer to have all three
the same and only require one wrench now.

In the process of replacing the tire mount I cleaned up some
rust spots where the tire mount holes were. I went down to
the local Ace Hardware store and bought a can of
Rust-O-Leom? spray paint. It turned out that this paint is a
pretty good match for the Mexico Beige paint on my bus.
It is a hair lighter, but I thought it was so good that I ground,
primed, and painted about five more small rust spots on
my bus.
