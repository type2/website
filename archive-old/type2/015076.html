To all of you with an auto that you might ever want to drop, save the above
post in its entirety.  That's the best description of how to get those
stupid bolts back in I've ever seen.  You might even be able to do it
yourself using that method.
Ian Cameron, been there done that.  (But not as elegantly.)
