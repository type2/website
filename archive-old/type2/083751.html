Subject: KYB's (and Full Moon in Joon Blues)

What a gorgeous weekend on the east coast.  I
know my moonie friends are having a great time at
Full Moon in Joon.  So I'm bummed.   Couldn't be
helped, though.  Grandpa's heart is acting up and
has him in a telemetry bed awaiting a cath and a
new pacemaker.  

I visited him today.  We're very close.  He even
helped my with my first vw rebuild.  I didn't
know how the check the oil when I got my first VW
and he'd never heard of a car with no radiator. 
Took about three weeks as we went page by page by
page comparing the instructions in three manuals.
 His face lights up any time he talks about how
that silly engine block is split. 

After I visited, I decided to put the KYB's on my
bus, just so I could do something VW'ish today. 
Old bolts came out easy, for old shock bolts.  

I use GMBulley's (the Heat Sound and Rust webpage
guy) method on bolts and nuts:  soak as much as
possible; clean thoroughly (threads on bolts or
the insides of those cv bolts);  tap the thing
fifty times (This is the key.  You tap downward
on the bolt or nut.  Does that make sense?  You
tap into the longitudinal axis of the bolt or
nut.  Like you are trying to force it further
inward.); then tighten just a hair; then loosen. 
Heat the outside of the female end only as a last
resort.  It works like a charm.  Just takes a
little more time.  

Installation was easy.  I did not remove the
plastic that held the thing compressed.  I bolted
up the bottom with the nut just barely on the
stud.  Then stuck the upper bolt just through the
top grommet.  The trick here is to have the thing
ready so that you can let the shock expand slowly
and hit the upper mount with that bolt already in
place.  You don't want to try to compress the
shocks if at all possible.  Then put the bolt on
the top.  Tighten it all down.  Oh yeah, I took
the tire off to make it easier to get in there,
but it's probably not necessary.  

How do they ride?  Well ok.  These are
gas-a-justs.  And they are supposed to be firm. 
Frankly, I'm underwhelmed.  The ride is not
harsh.  Sway is a little less.  But it is
certainly not as harsh or firm as I expected. 
I'd probably prefer a little more firm, in fact. 
I double checked to make sure I didn't get GR2's
by mistake.  

It cannot really compare the ride to anything
else as the last shocks were shot (the right was
completely frozen).  These boge's were probably
stock on my 74 with 30 years and 150,000 miles
under there belts.  It's also tough to judge any
effect on handling because I have a loosy goosy
frontend in need of at least a swing lever and
maybe a new box.  I did have dangerous handling
with that frozen right front.  Winds from the
left or dips on the right side would really make
my busses right front dive.

Bottom line:  certainly not too firm or harsh by
my standards.  I wouldn't want to have anything
softer on a bus.  I'll defer judgment on the
handling improvements until the rest of the front
end is right.
