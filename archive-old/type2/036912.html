&gt; &gt;   I am going to be shipping a VW Bus front axle
&gt; &gt; beam. I need to know if anyone has any Ideas how
&gt; &gt; to go about doing this. It will be going coast to
&gt; &gt; coast(almost). Any idea how much it weighs? Its a
&gt; &gt; 74 with master,booster, rotors, but no calipers.
&gt; &gt; How would I box it up? Any help would be great.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; take it to &quot;Mailboxes etc&quot; they claim they will pack and ship anything

They will, but be sure to check the shipping rates first.  I shipped a
transmission (I packed it) through Mailboxes, Etc, and they shipped it
(and charged me for) &quot;2-day&quot; when I wanted Ground.  Cost me about $40
because I didn't check UPS' website first to calc the rate.

You might also want to check with a trucking outfit.  You could strap the
beam to a pallet and ship it as (I think) &quot;used automobile parts&quot;.  The
shipping industry rate structure is byzantine, so it might be good to talk
to someone knowlegeable in the business.
