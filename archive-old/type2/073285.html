Seem close to what happened to me the day I picked up my '78.
The connecter to the voltage regulator was falling out.

At 9:20am -0600 3/10/99, Arvid Hokanson may have written:
&gt;Recently I had a problem with the alternator light coming on and then
&gt;the engine immediately dying.  I could restart the engine and the
&gt;problem only occurred when I was slowing down and almost stopped.
