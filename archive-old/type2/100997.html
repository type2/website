&gt; The Aux batteries haven't exploded or anything yet.

Gel cell batteries are charged differently than regular batteries and need
a special charger to fully charge them, (however this charger will
overcharge your regular battery) so while you won't blow em up you also
won't get full service out of them and will probably shorten their lives
