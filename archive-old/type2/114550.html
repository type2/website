Subject: Re: [T2] LED Replacements for Tail Lights

&gt;I've always thought that the brake light switch should be on 
&gt;the throttle linkage.  Any time the throttle is up, the brake 
&gt;lights should be on.  Another project...

I like the brake-light setup on my 914.  It's a switch mounted near the
brake pedal itself.  You can adjust it so it comes on as soon as the brake
pedal starts to move so you get brake lights before the brakes really start
to do anything.  Simple and effective.  I've toyed with the idea of using
the same switch on my bus, but never got around to it.
