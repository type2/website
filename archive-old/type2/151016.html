Subject: Re: [T2] Need help - color code

If your paint shop won't custom mix colors then go to another paint shop.
When I had my VW Thing painted I went to a hobby shop and found a color I
liked called Armor Sand, it was a Britsh Army color that they used on their
tanks and such as part of a Camo scheme.  I really liked the color so I
bought a bottle of the paint for about a buck and took it to my body shop.
He mixed up a few gallons and sprayed out the car and it looks too sweet.
It really gives the car a nice military look.  Just find a paint color you
like and take it to them.  We don't need no stinkin' codes, LOL!
