Subject: Re: [T2] CDI / Distributor Selection

When I worked at a VW shop, many of the Compu-Fire &quot;distributorless&quot;
electronic ignition units that we had installed failed. The part that kept
failing was the four-coil &quot;Custom Coil Pack,&quot; not the Hall-effect electronic
module and magnetic trigger rotor, which were practically bullet-proof.

The Pertronix Ignitor was also extremely reliable.

Both the Pertronix and the Compu-Fire points replacement modules produce high
voltage spark reliably when used with a standard cylindrical coil, such as
the Bosch blue coil (the good version) or the Pertronix Flame Thrower coil.

I've been running a Pertronix Ignitor I in my '79 bus for ten years now, with
no problems. The bus has the stock Bosch 0231 168 005 distributor. I did have
to replace the stock coil four years ago when its spark had deteriorated to an
anemic orange. It ran perfectly again with a Bosch blue coil and it now runs
even a little better since I installed a Pertronix 40511 Flame Thrower 3.0 ohm
coil. The plugs are gapped at .040 inches.

Comp-U-Fire distributorless ignition for your 009 is what the doctor
ordered, IMHO. I have put thousands of trouble-free miles and have a tidy
engine compartment to boot. You can even open up your gap on your plugs to
.050 to get a better spark and better mileage. The performance improvements
are remarkable and the 009's &quot;flat-spot&quot; disappears.

&gt; Background:  Currently my bus is running a 71 DP engine.  Initially I
&gt; was using the distributor from the original 68 SP engine with a
&gt; Petronix, but the Petronix failed 30 miles shy of completing a
&gt; cross-country journey.  So I put the 71 DP distributor (vac adv/ret)
&gt; which has a leak in one of the vaccuum cans.  Since then I installed
&gt; an 009 distributer that I had laying around (don't ask why the
&gt; original 68 SP distributor didn't go back in with new points/condensor).
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, I've been considering purchasing the Mallory HyFire VI CDI
&gt; and a Mallory coil, and I was wondering what would the recommended
&gt; distributor be assuming all 3 were in working order.  Which leads me
&gt; to question 2 - can you fix the vaccuum cans?
&gt;
&gt; TIA.
