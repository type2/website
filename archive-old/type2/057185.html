&gt;Would you rely on Muir's 
rap on oil and stick with straight weight heavy duty oil,&lt;

Chris,

        Good question.......I am sure though that everyone agrees that one
of the most overlooked points with Muir's ideas is that he died in
like...nineteen-seventy-something.  In most of the discussions that I have
followed, it seems the newer Multi-Vis oils are considered better, and, of
course, synthetic (where's D.Schwarze?) is even better.

        In my experience, synthetics are more for longetivity of oil.  This
is great in a Type4 where you have an oil filter and run a little higher
engine temps and want your oil to last for 3k+ miles.  Upright V-dub
engines dont normally have a filtration system so oil changes are much more
needed so longetivity is not as important.  I have ran 10W30 in my '69
upright and noticed a lot smoother running.  The thing that bothered me,
though, was that the thinner oil seems to find a way to leak out better
than the flat 30wt.

        My opinion is this.  If you have a new upright, I would run 10w30
in Winter, maybe 10w40 or 20w50 in the Summer.  If you have a worn upright
(like all mine), I would run 30wt in Summer and 10w30 in Winter.   If you
have a type 4, which I have no experience on, I would use the most
expensive oil I could find (synthetic 20w50) for a new engine and maybe run
something cheap and thick for a worn one (30wt).
