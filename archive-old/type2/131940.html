Subject: Single Cab Gates Question's 

Howdy

Hope you dont mind but I sent it to both lists just in case somebody might 
know somebody with the answers.

Anyways here goes.
I'm looking for gates for my 67 Single Cab.
I just need the sides but I'll take all 3.
Problem is I live in NJ and all the decent gates I see are out west.

My questions are:

Has anybody ever shipped gates across the country or across state lines via 
some sort of shipping Co.?
If so how and whom did you use?
How much did it cost?

Does anybody on the list Private or Vendor have any gates for sale?

Is anybody interetsed in me paying you for your time to look at gates (that 
are close to where you live) and shipping them to me if the seller is 
unwilling to do so?

For instance I know somebody with a truck out west.
I'll buy the whole truck.
You ship me the gates and keep the rest of the truck.
Obviously it would be a parts truck and not one worthy of restoration.

I'm willing to pay a decent price as long as the gates are straight and rust 
free.
I've already got bent and rusty ones.

Thanks
Kevin
