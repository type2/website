Subject: Dummy Assistant

On my 69 bus I ways able to start  or crank the engine from the rear
compartment by turning the key on and then flipping a light swith on that
was connected to the battery terminal on the selenoid of the starter motor
and some other terminal on the starter motor ( I forget which or what ) is
any familiar with this particular jury rig to take the place of the
assistant?  You could get almost the same effect by sticking a large screw
driver between these two points. I don't want to experiment with my 77 if I
don't have to.
