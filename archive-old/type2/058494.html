Subject: Trip Report - Williamsburg Fall Gathering

This is my latest trip report. I don't weigh in much with the reports
because 99 44/100ths of my driving is around town. 
I will also keep it short because (fortunately) the 
trip went well and there were few bus related 
incidents. My traveling companion was Murphy,
the mostly black Lab. Vehicle: 1971 Deluxe Bus.

Left Washington, DC at 4:30 PM Friday Sept 11th. Proceeded
down I-95, sitting a few times in traffic. At Fredrickburg I jumped
off onto Route 1, Americas Main Street. I kicked back into 
the 'driving and meditating' phase of being in tune
with the road, the engine, the steering and even the wind
currents. (Important for us Sail-bus drivers) Hours and miles
later, I moved over to Route 60 East outside of Richmond
and plied my way down one of those 'Blue Highways' 
of the long-populated East Coast. I wont try to describe all
of the little hamlets and wizened faces that I saw, that is better
left to Charlie Ford and like-minded word smiths.
Arrived at The Fall Gathering of the Tribes for the weekend.

No bus content for the tribes except for the awesome folks from
Russell Fork River (VA-KY border): http://www.surfbwa_dot_org/russellfork98/
in their Westy. Those guys fit more stuff and people in a westy than
I have ever seen. After the three kayaks, 4 bikes, 5 people, 4 large drums,
two coolers, two big dogs and piles of clothes, I stopped counting.
They must have had that 'Enchanted bottomless closet' option
from the Gnomes of the Black Forest. Much music, revelry and
sage comments were exchanged with these new friends, 
I just wish I had the first weekend of October free to go to their party.

Just another example of the VW busses ability to make friends of people.

Coming home on Sunday it was hot and dry, temps in the low 90s
and a 20 knot breeze pushing back hard on the bus.  The 
engine was way hot, but not at the '3rd degree burns from the dipstick'
stage. Murphy and I stopped once about 2:00pm in some
shady trees by the side of the road to cool off, get a drink, stretch
and chase rabbits. (Well, he did, I was too hot.)  As aside: What other
car is just the right height to sit in the side door comfortably?
All other vans are too high or have annoying steps or doors that
don't swing all the way. Genius is in the details.

After about 15 minutes, just as we were about to get back in 
and roll the local 'Deputy' (Looked like any other farmer
to me, I never saw a badge) rolls up in his new stepside
and tells me that I best get rolling, if I know what is good for me.
Now, I admit that I have committed the sin of trespassing, but
it would take a forensics expert to have told that I had ever been 
there, once I had left. But, not the confrontational type, I packed
physical and mental baggage and hit the road. 

The bus had her first mechanical issue of the trip then. 
The choke was cooled off enough to close part way
but the engine was still too hot to need it, so it flooded
a little and was hard to start. I went around back and 
propped the choke open, cranked to ventilate and
it finally caught. I moseyed away from the 'deputy'
with gravel flying as I aimed the rear at him and stomped
on it. On other mechanical notes, the new CVs from the 
Bus Depot are fine, I just hope they last longer.
(&lt;GRIPE&gt;500 miles and 1200 miles on the two previous sets
from Ron.&lt;/GRIPE&gt;)

Other mechanical notes: My right rear top shock bolt
came loose a few weeks ago and wobbled around in its
hole. I tightened it up before the trip, but it is loose again. I think
I might have buggered the threads for it. How do I repair that?)

Stats: 326 miles. Got 22 MPG going down, 15 MPG coming back.
(Big difference. Down was cool evening with a tail wind, 
back was hot afternoon with a 20 Knot head wind.)
Saw gas as cheap as 83 cents, multiple less than 90 cents.
Saw one other air cooled Bus out and about, and a pair
of 'restorable' busses, one splitty panel and one '72 stripped
westy for sale along the side of the road, but the for sale
sign had fallen off the dash and I could not read the phone numbers
from the window.

Well this is long enough. Get out there and drive those busses! Winter
is coming soon, and nothing beats the hot Indian Summer 
wind as it blows this summer and endless opportunities 
into the past.
