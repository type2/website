&gt;Can anyone give us an idea as to what could be causing this low cranking
&gt;vacuum?

what is the test point for this cranking vacuum reading ?
what does the vacuum read at idle and at speed ? (throttle closed ).

you might try removing the carb and centering the thruttle plate-
hold it up to the light, look thru the bottom, loosen the throttle
plate screws, snap the throttle to center the plate, then tighten.
