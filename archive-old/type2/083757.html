Just to let you know, that is not what is
commonly called a 010, even though it ends in
010.  010 is a mechanical a mechanical only dizzy
that is a predecessor to the 009.  050 is also
mechanical only.  These dizzies were not stock on
any vw's, to my knowledge (though I think 010 was
on early porsches?)  

Like your dizzy that ends in 010 there are many
dual action dizzies that end in 050, but are not
what we mean when we say &quot;050.&quot;  

Now your problems.  
First- the dizzy doesn't seem to have much
mechanical advance with the ports plugged you
only go from 8 BTDC to 20, right?  But that is at
2000 rpm.  Bring it up to 3000 and see what you
get.  

Second- your dizzy is retarding.  (Which is not
really a problem, it is supposed to do that I
assume, but you are mostly looking for advance
not emissions control, right)  You have two vac
ports on the dizzy, right?  You are obviously
connecting to the retard side.  The retard is
usually on the inner face and the advance is on
the outer face of the vacuum pot on the dizzy. 
Try connecting your port vacuum to the advance
port on the dizzy.  Recheck for advance with the
engine running.  Your really going to need a
cheap vacuum gauge to further discern what is
going on.  

Third- I cannot find this dizzy in
Oldvolkshome_dot_com data.  Anybody know what this
is?
