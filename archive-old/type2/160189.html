Subject: Re: [T2] Great North American Extreme Bus Race

Hi Rob,

Mapquest says my run is as follows:

Total Est. Time: 180 hours, 19 minutes
Total Est. Distance: 10,729 miles

With gas estimated at $3/gallon and milage at 20 MPG  that's over  
$1,500US in fuel.
Breaking the 180 hours into 10-hour days means 18 days travel. Might  
as well plan the trip for 25 days to allow a week of stopover days  
when you need to stop and smell the roses. Sure, it's a race; but is  
it worth missing the once-in-a-lifetime experiences just to win a set  
of tires, etc? Not in my book.

25 days of road tripping would require another $5,000 in expenses to  
cover camping fees and meals, etc. Wear and tear would also be a  
factor; my westy typically costs about $1,200CDN per year in upkeep  
and this trip would put that entire year's milage into one month.  
Since the trip would involve harsher-than-average conditions we'll  
double that estimate and call it $2,500 in maintenance.

It's a $10K trip, give or take. Given the success of Little Miss  
Sunshine,  I think I'll put the movie rights on the block for $200K,  
and see you in Alaska!


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt;&gt; 5,000 mile trip is not that big a deal if your bus is in good shape.
&gt;
&gt; That's about as true a statement as any
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I would do it tomorrow if I had the time and $$$ available.
&gt;&gt; Unfortunately I have a day job and a family with kids in school. And
&gt;&gt; of course 5,000 miles is only the race itself; Even if you lived
&gt;&gt; right on the route itself you still need to get to the start point
&gt;&gt; and home from the finish. So it's a 10,000 - 12,000 mile trip,  
&gt;&gt; really.
&gt;
&gt; I just took a look with RandMcNally TripMaker, from home to Key  
&gt; West to Fairbanks to home is just under 11k miles, about 200 hr of  
&gt; driving time.
&gt; I'd probably need 3 weeks for the trip &amp; the time just isn't there.
&gt;
&gt; It would be good fun wouldn't it?
