Subject: EGR question

Volks,

I have a 1974 Deluxe Westy that has about 900 miles on the rebuild.  During
the rebuild, I took off all of the EGR plumbing due to the fact that there
is no emission testing in Indiana and the EGR equipment was missing.  Now
the question: do l need to re-jet my carbs?  Reason that l ask this is that
with the EGR equipment, you have the tubes coming out of the exhaust part
of the heads and dump into the intake manifold.  With this missing,
wouldn't the engine pull more air/fuel mixture from the carb, thus making
it run richer?  My engine is running way too rich.  Along the same lines,
will the removal of the EGR require me to adjust the timing to a different
mark?

TIA
