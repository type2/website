&gt; So anyway, I guess now I just need some reassurance that this hammock
&gt; will fit in my bus.  Does anyone who has their hammock for a '70 bus
&gt; want to measure their poles for me so I can ensure I get the right
&gt; merchandise?
&gt; 
&gt; Again, Thanks in Advance!

I just measured one from a 71 at 56-1/4&quot; overall(that's outside to
outside). I'm about 98% certain that a 70 would be the same. These
supports were very slightly bent, I doubt that makes much difference.
