Subject: re:seatbelts

I'd like to know if anyone makes a belt and hardware that looks like the vw
ones in my 77, or do we have to install the generic type?  How to attach it
safely?  It's strange that the '77 westy sleeps five comfortably in beds,
yet only really seats(with belts) four. Too bad the slide-in middle doudle
seat for westys didn't come along until the vanagons.
