Subject: Re: [T2] Ign. Switch replaced, now starter failing

Billy,

Divide and conquer!!


As usual, one part at a time.  Eliminate the ignition switch as a problem 
by using a manual one and see if it helps....bridge it, junp it, buy a 
manual starter button.

See my electrical rant from several years ago about cleaning *all* your 
electrical connections....including the transmission ground strap, both 
battery terminals, the wires that actual go to the starter, the 
starter contact lugs...etc.

I have found that my 78 FI starts incredibly well if the battery is really 
charged up properly.  The difference after being on a charger and then 
starting it is amazing.  I've noticed this on modern american FI cars as 
well.  

Cheers, dave

&gt; The new ignition switch made for improved startups.  For a few days.
&gt; 
 This morning all I got was a big &quot;clack&quot; from the solenoid.  I put the bus
 in gear and rocked it forward and back a few times and it started.
 
 Happened again at lunch (still getting the &quot;clack&quot;) and I had to push start
&gt; it.
&gt; 
&gt; I assume I may be looking at chasing down the whole ignition/starting
&gt; circuit now that I've thrown the new switch in there.
&gt; 
&gt; Thoughts? (76 bus w/ 79 CA engine)
