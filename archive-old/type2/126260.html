Subject: Re: [T2] water injection was Re: Strange thoughts when bored at
  work...

Looks like these boy's took something simple, made it complicated--and
making money at it--
Yepppp --it looks as though these guys reinvented that wheel Jim.

There is nothing elctrical needed to make this sysyem fly--

I couldn't find the price on it---except they have a $20.00 minimum
order--

Surely it can't be much more than that.
( no I'm not calling you Shirley )--:&gt;)

Quit trying to reinvent the wheel. 
&lt;http://www.racetep_dot_com/wik.html#nah20&gt; Had one on my Datsun 1200
racecar and on my blown TR4. Worked as advertised. 
HOWEVER... This is water injected into the incoming fuel/air charge. Not
water spraying on hot metal. Water on hot metal just sounds wrong.
