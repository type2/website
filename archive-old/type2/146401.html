Subject: How deep is back hatch?

I am redoing the panels on my daily driver van.  I would like to install
speakers in the back hatch (I know the pitfalls of doing that, i.e.
slamming, moisture, etc).

Since I didn't drive the van today and my wife and baby are picking me up
from work for a trip home to VaBeach, I don't have the oppourtunity to go
out and measure the depth myself.

Would anyone here have the measurement handy so I can be sure and not get
speakers that are too deep?

Thanks!
