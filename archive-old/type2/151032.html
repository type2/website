Subject: Re: [T2] Headliner Install

George,

I have done one on my 78.

It is a big job and all windows must be out(except the rear one)...which 
means all new window seals after you are done.

I also had problems with the headliner from TMI not being made 
correctly....fixed by the local upholstery guys for $35.
The bow hangers were all made the same height and should not have been.

Others on the list may chime in as I know some other folks have done it as 
well.

You can do it...just be prepared for about 60+ hours spread over several 
weeks.  Seems like I spent more time trying to decide how to do it rather 
than actually doing it.

I works best if you do it when it is warm(or hot).

ONLY use professional upholstery glue...not anything from the local auto 
stores.  Buy it from the upholstery guys in a glass jar that you take in 
to them.


Upholstery guys here would have charged two legs and an arm to do it.

&amp;gt; Greetings everyone. New to the list.  Have a 68 Type II which is in
&amp;gt; remarkably good shape for it's age.
&amp;gt; Opinion needed.  Do I attempt to install a new headliner myself or get  a
&amp;gt; pro to do it?  I have asked around here (Northern New Jersey) to the various
&amp;gt; VW shops and no one wants to touch it.  Any suggestions?
