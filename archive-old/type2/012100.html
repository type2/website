Roughly a month ago, I pulled my engine 1600 DP for the first time.  All I've
really done to it in that time was strip it to the long-block, clean it, 
paint it, and, having repaired the two exhaust studs that i broke, tonight
a friend and i did finally got the endplay down to 0.003-0.004 (from ~0.0100).

When I got home, however, i went to turn the engine to TDC and realized
that i couldn't turn the engine any more than a half an inch or so in
either direction before it hung up on something.  I don't want to 
attempt to force it -- thought about using a cheater pipe on the gland nut
to see if I could get it &quot;un-stuck&quot; but thought better of it -- but
I'm not sure where to go from here.  My gut reaction is that in 
sitting for a month in my cold and sometimes damp garage for a month, the engine
could have rusted, but I guess I think that's unlikely because I think it
turned over a week or two ago when I last tried to turn the it over manually.

My other thoughts are:  

	a) something associated with the positioning of the crank due
		to the additional shims  (i think i saw a bad bearing
		listed as the cause of someone's troubles in a related issue)

	b) i noticed that the #2 intake pushrod tube had been mangled in moving my
		engine to my friend's house -- the damn air control diaphram 
		did it, but i digress -- although pulling that rod didn't free
		things up, so i'm assuming that's not it...

	c) ???

So I guess my first step is to back out to an intermediate shim and try to get
my endplay closer to 0.005 and see if that sorts me out for the time being.  

Anyone else out there have any advice on what else to check, or thoughts on what
else could be wrong?

thanks,
