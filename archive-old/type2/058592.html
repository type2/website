Subject: Heat for VW Bus

The heat in your bus CAN work great, but it isn't cheap. I think ours (with me
doing the work) was about $1,200. I am just finishing a website documenting
the update of our 1976 loaf, which included a complete update and substantial
improvement to the heat now it REALLy works. 

We insulated the body of the van, insulated the ducting, added two additional
300cfm blowers, wrapped the exhaust system with a fiberglass webbing (racing
product), Replaced the exchangers, flappers, riser tubes. Installed heat re-
circulation ducting (sucks in warm air from inside the van, rather than 20
degree air from outside).

The end result: We've had it down to 5 degrees, and litterally been in shirt
sleeves. It warms up almost instantly, and can melt ice off the front window
in a few minutes, takes only about 10-15 minutes to warm the entire van
(contents and all) to the point you have to turn it down.

I'll have the site up and running in the next day. Any AOL members who can
help me with the upload/set up, I would sure appreciate it. First time! Give a
call at the (tollfree) number below, after 5:00 p.m. today (EDT) gracias.

Happy heating,
