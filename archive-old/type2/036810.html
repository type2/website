You know,
I bought two of these several years ago for my '69 at Home Depot or 
Builder's Square.
I'm sure I got the handles in the plumbing supply area.
They were being sold as replacement handles for valves, such as on hose 
bibs.
I'm about 99% certain that I found those things in the plumbing area.
