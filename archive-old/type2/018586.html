Subject: Paint shop in Portland, OR?
Message-ID: &lt;376BD19E.3DC47F81_at_teleport_dot_com&gt;

Howdy - I live in Portland, OR and just received a nice bonus from work and thought it would be good to deal with all of the tiny rust spots, scratches, etc on Doris, my '76. Does anyone in the area recommend a paint shop that is friendly to aged VW's? Any general comments on how to deal with the painters? What to ask for, what to watch out for, etc?


Many Thanks, Ron Johnson
