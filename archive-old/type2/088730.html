(just gonna try this one more time just in case somebody missed it the =
first time)
ok, I still need help! I've got an 81' cal. model westy. it seems to run
with no fuel pressure                                                    =
                     =20
the original prob was it(I) would be puttin' along just fine then it =
would just lose power and die! pumping gas had no effect
#1) 3 of the 4 injectors can be unplugged and it still runs=20
#2) it runs better on 2 than 4 injectors
#3) will run with AFM unplugged, fuel pump shuts off, no pressure in =
lines for 30-40 minutes
#4) unplug vac. booster and it revs to 3000 and stays
#5) bypass cold start-runs 10-15 min. or more
#6) checks valves are good
#7) fuel will still run thru it, pressure test is good
all of the usual has been tested or replaced and tested again!(AFM, =
double relay, O2 sensor, cyl temp sensor, etc. per Bently . even swaped =
ecu's w/no effect!
is there a &quot;zen mechanic&quot; out there that might fathom this situation?  =
the analytical approach does not seem to be working for me OR my usually =
very competent support group
p.s. email answers/suggestions/prayers to me direct
         thanks in adv.,  a. hoffmann
