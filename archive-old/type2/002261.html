Cripes!

I have been chumped by a swimsuit model!

After a close inspection of my engine, the three pronged FI harness ground
attaches to the topmost case bolt nearest the transmission, exactly as the
esteemed Mr. Dolan states.

Although it probably would not fit over the case to transmission bolt, it
would still work if reverse engineered. But it is always better to follow
the DM.
