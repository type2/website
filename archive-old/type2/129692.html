Subject: Re: [T2] painting a pop-top

Hi Chris, Thanks for fielding that one... I'll take it from here.

Jason... $20 or so will get you a quart of Interlux Premium Yacht 
Enamel at your local marina or quality hardware store. Accept no 
substitute. This stuff goes on beautifully with a brush or roller and a 
quart will cover the roof twice with enough left over to coat the 
bumpers to match. Mission accomplished. Even though it's brushed or 
rolled on, it smooths as it dries and the finish looks excellent and 
wears extremely well.

I used it in the spring of 2001 and it still looks new. It's designed 
for fibreglass boats and it can really take a licking. Highly 
recommended.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; while it was off and seems that he used something for boats or 
&gt; fiberglass not sure which or both,..? that would probaldy be your best 
&gt; bet... i think the paint is some sort of sealent also or maybe not..
