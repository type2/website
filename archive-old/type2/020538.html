Subject: Re: [T2] power inverting - 12 volt plugin in westys.
References: &lt;F20REHrku5oUH0JsBKi0000120d_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

[...]I carry a portable inverter that I got at some discount 
superstore.  It's rated 300W continuous, has a lighter plug with an 
adapter to battery clips on the input cord and two 120VAC outlets.  
Since my bus did not have a lighter socket, I rigged a 12V power 
outlet.  So, while under way, I can run 120VAC stuff in the bus, like my 
son's laptop, and a CD player.

While camping, I use a separate battery and the battery clip to lighter 
plug adapter to power the inverter.  Usually, we run strings of 
miniature lights put up around the edges of our canopy.  We sometimes 
bring a blender, to make those late afternoon cocktails - and impress 
the neighbors.

I suppose I could rig it up so the inverter could power the 120VAC 
outlet in the bus, but that would require some sort of transfer switch, 
i.e., please heed the advice given in a previous post about not creating 
a situation where you backfeed and thus cause the exposed pins on your 
Westy's 120VAC input to be exposed and live.

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; chances are there is a really good reason this wouldn't work, but
&gt; from someone who doesn't know all that much about electricity
&gt; it seems like a good idea to me.
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, I have a new westfalia. Its got one of those power hookup thingys
&gt; for when you camp someplace that allows you to plug your bus in, which 
&gt; I am guessing is usually an RV park or something, anyway its not 
&gt; important to me.
&gt; What I was thinking is this :
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;I wonder if I could hookup a power inverter to this plug in thing and 
&gt; connect that to a second battery?&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Am I missing something pretty obvious that would make this not work?
&gt; If I am not, but it would require a little research and effort, I am 
&gt; all for it. Maybe I could somehow hook up a switch to toggle if I 
&gt; wanted to get power from the inverter versus the hookup, if I happen 
&gt; to be parked near a wall outlet. (hehe)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; on a totally side note, I ordered a bunch of stuff on 1/31 from two of 
&gt; the bigger bus parts suppliers and was curious as to which would 
&gt; deliver the goods first since I played the orders both on the same day.
&gt; 
&gt; Today the delivery man rang and I sprang to see which had beaten to 
&gt; other only to see him standing there with one under each arm.
&gt; 
&gt; I wont name names but they rhyme with rus fetot and ro sesty.
