I am graduating next Sunday with a Sociology/Anthropology major and an
Educational Studies minor from Ripon College in Wisconsin.  I'm getting
married this summer and Ryan and I are moving to Ely, Minnesota where we
will continue to run our web design business part time and get full time
jobs as well.  I'm trying to get a job as an IT assistant with the school
district or something like that.  I'll probably end up temping or being a
secretary for while.  Whatever pays the payments on our new Ch*vy
Venture....  Eventually we want to do IWD full time and own a store.

On another note, everyone was right about the battery being dead in my '78.
In fact, it was so dead that the guy at Napa laughed at me.  He said it's
going to take atleast 48 hours to charge it back up, but that my charger
meter just isn't very sensitive but it works.  So that's charging as we
speak and I'm 80% sure I'll be able to put the battery in Monday and she'll
start right up - I'm sure you'll hear about it if she doesn't  :)  Also, a
fellow listee in the same town as me, Isaiah, is going to weld in a new
battery tray and some new footwells for me - yay!  No more battery falling
through the floor or getting splashed through the footwells when we go
through a puddle.
