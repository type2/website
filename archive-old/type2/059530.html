&lt;&lt;I'm looking for a place where I can find decent radios for my 72 westy that
aren't too expensive.  I'd like to find a tape deck with one of those fake
alarm lights, and a CD input.  Also I'm planning on installing a bass kicker
for the &quot;Ghetto Cruiser&quot; anybody else try this, i'm thinking of putting it
under the main couch/backseat.  And I'm planning on installing 6x9 speakers in
the hatchback, anybody try this too?
Thanks,

i got 2 phoenix-gold xmax 10's under my seat where supposedly the spare was
when it was original. i tried almost every location for the subs and i couldnt
get any of the sound up to the front....so i just decided to try n' make a box
that fits under my front bench.....it really sounds good there, i think it is
the most efficent place in the vw.i have a cd player mounted in the original
radio place, and 6.5 boston's placed in the doors, i dont know about 6*9 in
the hatch, i whould think the panel whould fall out with the weight, i have a
bed fitted into mine, the po just took some wood and extended the engine
compartment until where the door starts so i am going to put some 6*9's in
that storage place that is right to the left of the door....that should fill
in the rear good enough for when im camping ...i have a 72 hardtop sunroof
&quot;camper&quot; 

i have another question for you all.... where can i route my rca cables and
front speaker cables, i have no clue where i can without putting it under the
bus or without them showing......thanks all(right now i just have them laying
around)
