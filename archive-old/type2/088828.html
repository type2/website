Subject: A transmission question

Hi all:

I'm going to pull the transmission and engine from my newly-acquired '82
Westy together.

While I'm pawing through the engine I was thinking it would be a &quot;good
thing&quot; (as Martha Stewart says) to clean the innards of the transmission,
and I thought I might drain it of gear oil and then fill it up and let is
sit for a while with automatic transmission fluid.  Is anybody aware of any
problems with this approach?  I figure it would probably sit for a couple of
weeks (or more) before I drained it again and re-filled it with regular gear
oil, so I'm wondering if there would be any problems with the various seals
and so forth.  Or is this a case of trying to be too sanitary in a situation
that doesn't warrant it?

TIA.
