&gt; Went to Home Depot and created a tool using a 5/8&quot; all-thread a series of

The problem is that you have a mondo strong thread, but relatively thin
washers.  The washers are the weak point.

Now, if you get some 3/8 thick steel plate and make a _thick_ washer out
of it you will get better results.

IIRC, I used a socket whose OD was slightly smaller than the swing lever
pin on top.  On the bottom, I used a deep socket large enough to hold one
of the bushings.  The all-thread was just small enough to go through the
sockets.

Assembled the whole works and commenced to pulling.  Pulled both bushings
out the bottom, one after the other.

Keep at it.  You will prevail.
