Subject: Good-bye Westfakia

The deed is done. It has been in the works for some time but now it 
is all too real. The '67 has been misbehaving in protest but there 
was nothing it could really do. Joel called me today and asked if he 
could pic the bus up tonite. I came home and cleared the remainder of 
our stuff from it and thought about the last 35000 miles we had spent 
together. . BOTBR was her first campout. Since she left the 
dealership she had  never spent time with other buses and as quite 
happy to among them again.The camping never stopped. Doc Ric donated 
a Westy camping interior to her and the old passenger interior has 
gone on to complete three other buses. Our daughter Stella loved and 
I mean LOVED camping in her. We took care of each other but that time 
has come for her to move on. I hope she and Joel get along as well as 
we did and that they have as much fun.

As silly as it sounds I hugged my bus good-bye tonite. I wish Joel 
the best of times with her and look forward to seeing her again at 
EveryBus.
