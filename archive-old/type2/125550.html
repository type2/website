Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel Injectors (Autozone variety)

&gt; &gt;Bosch bought Lucas
&gt; 
&gt; Of all the Lucas electrics I've seen
&gt; to date, I wouldn't ever have known. :-)


Several companies market parts under the Lucas name, but Bosch is not
one of them. The company got split into pieces. The TRW Automotive Group
(which also owns Varga) owns the Lucas name for use on brake parts, a
joint venture called Lucas-SRE makes Lucas electrics, and Delphi bought
their diesel parts division.
