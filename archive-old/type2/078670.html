Subject: Buses and Punkin Chunkin in the first state is this weekend Nov. 2-4th Everyone is Welcome

The event is upon us. I will be arriving at about 3:00 Friday afternoon.Upon
checking in
please tell them you are with the vw group and or give them my name so they
know where
to send you. This is a very large campground and they seem a bit
unorganized. They have
blocked us for at least 15 sites. But I think we will go over that amount of
buses.I asked
 for the area that we had last year. If you are going and haven`t contacted
me you can until Thurs.
evening. But if you don`t that`s ok too. We are planning the potluck for
Sat. evening and breakfast
Sun. morning. If you can contribute that would be great. Bring firewood if
you can also.
They rape you for it at the campground. If anyone has any questions or need
directions
just contact me.
Thanks,
Dave Parsons
