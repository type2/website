Subject: Help with engine removal

Help
I'm having a brain freeze..I have a 73 Westy with an automatic
transmission. Last month I
dropped the # 3 exhaust valve. That was the worst sound I've heard. I
towed the bus home thinking I would just pull the engine, tip it to long
block, rebuild it and put it back in.
I have owned over 10 VW's and still have a 60 bug and a passat. I
thought I had a good idea of what to do. I have pulled and rebuilt a
number of engines before. I have pulled off the entire exhaust system,
the rear tin, disconnected major gas lines and electrical. I have the
idiot book plus 2 others. From what I've read it should be very straight
forward.
Disconnect the torque converter from the engine. (3 bolts)  2 upper
bolts and 2 lower
motor mounts. Support the tranny remove the back motor mount bracket,
pull the engine
back lower it and put some sort of bar over the converter preventing it
from coming out.

Well, when I slid under the bus I found all sorts of weird stuff. Like
hoses to the tranny
tubes sticking out of engine and things I've never seen before. Things
that are not listed or talked about in any books I have.

I don't want to spend $1200. for R&amp;R of the engine plus $2000. for the
rebuild.

The question I have, if anyone is still reading this sad story, is this;

Does anyone know someone that could lend a hand with this project?
or can someone provide the information and therapy that will allow me to
crawl back under
her belly see things more clearly.
I'm willing to spend $ for the help (only if you get your hands dirty  :
)

I live in Antioch,  California
Sorry to the East Coast guys..I can not afford travel expenses for you,
but you could still
send you experience and knowledge via E-mail.
I love the bus and I feel that I'm getting jacked around by the local
wrenches.
Thanks for any help

George
