Subject: Re: [T2] Fire &amp; Theft Insurance in Mexico (NONE!!!)

Ben,

Having grown up close to the border in Texas and having driven in Mexico, 
I would advise you to skip driving into Mexico unless you are dead set on 
it.

If you want to drive in Mexico in your bus, then you are going to *have* 
to deal with the insurance questions.

Mexican justice is like France...you are quilty until proven innocent.
Have an accident in Mexico and you may sit in jail while they try and 
figure out who caused it...especially if injuries are involved.  They 
would surely impound your vehicle for the duration.

If it is parked for any length of time and not in your view, parts *will* 
be stolen off of it.  It will also make you a large target for people 
trying to extort money from you.

Last time I went, I parked on the U.S. side of the border and walked 
across...had a great time and didn't worry about my car at all.
Walked or took a taxi.

Yeah, I know people go across all the time in places, but they are 
generally locals who know the ropes and live close.  If something happens
they are still close to home and help.

Sorry to be such a wet blanket, but that is how I have seen it.

Cheers, dave

&gt; As I am leaving in 10 days for the southern USA and Mexico (well, not

&gt; entering, driving in Mexico, I have learned that American or Canadian 
&gt; insurance covering are not valid in Mexico??? Well OK, so I did some 
&gt; research and I was told / I found that it was quite easy to take a 
&gt; Mexican insurance, BUT!!!!!
