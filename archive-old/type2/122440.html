Yes or stabilizer.

&gt; here i am thinking i
&gt; thought i've seen everything, then i pull a dash pod to remove dash stuff,
&gt; and then down the way i remove another pod, same vintage, and there's that
&gt; part again - what is it. i grabbed one, threw it into my tool bucket, and
&gt; found  it in the books to be called none other than a - -vibrator? do i
&gt; have a vibrator on my 75? i never looked ?~0

Every gas gauge has one on the back. Some are the metal can type, some are

Of the 10 I pulled at the junkyard one time, 7 were good.
