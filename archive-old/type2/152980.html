Subject: Bus Mechanics in South Bend, Indiana Area?

Hello to all Bus Pilots on the list!

  I have been reading the posts for a few weeks, now.  Thanks to all
for the great info and discussions.  I've learned alot just reading,
but still have a long way to go.

  I just acquired a '77 Deluxe Westfalia and a '79 Deluxe Westfalia at
the same time a few weeks ago.

The '79 is in really good shape; California Bus, no rust!  It is
Mexico Beige and a real beauty.  The '77 was Marinagotte Yellow ( I
think that's what sticker behind the driver's seat says!) but has been
blasted with primer and now looks purple.  Has some body and rust
issues.

Was wondering if any can recommend any mechanics or garages in the
South Bend, Indiana area that work on an air-cooled engine and'or
bodywork for the big issues

I'm not too skilled with the earlier buses, and thought a back up
might be a good thing.

Thanks for any info.

Pete
