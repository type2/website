Subject: Re: RE Rust Removal--

Hello all,
FYI
   I just went to look for EXTEND at the &quot;Home Desperate&quot; near my house. I 
looked all over and couldn't find any so I was looking at other products I 
could use as a substitute. Well surprise, surprise EXTEND is now being 
packaged as Naval Jellly Rust Neutralizer at least that's what it says on the 
back of the can. It comes in both spray and &quot;goo&quot; packaging.
