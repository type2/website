Subject: Thread repairs - TIME-SERT

I recently came across this outfit's website while looking for something else.

They offer American and Metric screw thread inserts and associated tools.  If 
their products do what they claim, this appears to be a considerable 
improvement over the Helicoil procedure.

The TIME-SERT website is at:
