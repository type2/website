Subject: transmission failure , how common is this?

Ok , i pulled my busted transmission that kept me from camping at EB. As I
suspected , the long bracket that holds the Selector link had broken  . This
has happened before in another bus I owned, How common is this? I have a
bracket i can use from one of my spare trannies but i need to locate another
one so that my spare is still functional. Any one know where i can get one?
Would welding it back togeather be a viable option?
Thanks,
 Bryan
