&gt;Anyone else having this experience?

If you'll think about you'll see that this is a logically pointless thing
to ask of a list that might be down. We had a bit of DNS trouble, David was
on top of it but Internic is a ponderous thing so it takes a little time.
Please DO NOT EVER post &quot;is the list down?&quot; messages on any mailing list.
