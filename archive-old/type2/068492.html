Subject: Hyannis MA VW Repair Place - Any Experiences?

I'm now shopping around for a restoration shop to fix my '56 beetle (after 
getting it's nose smooshed). In an old edition of DBHVWs, theres an 
advertisement for a place called &quot;Bugs, Busses &amp; Things&quot; located in Hyannis, 
MA down on old Cape Cod.

Anyone out there have any experiences with these folks?

TIA

Ric
