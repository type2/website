Subject: RE: [T2] Hydraulic lifters - mistake to r...

&gt; I want to thank you. The last go around on this &quot;evil subject&quot; I was
&gt; convinced that I would never use those &quot;heathen lifters&quot; (oops I meant
&gt; Hydraulic). Minister Raby had convinced me that never was I to use those.
&gt; Now I have changed my mind again. I would like to compare the engine tear
&gt; down information, to be posted later, to the engines that Chris(aka
&gt; Vanagonman) has had to fix, to the PO history of abuse, to look at one thing
&gt; in particular:
&gt;
&gt; Were the Valves adjusted correctly, periodically checked, ever given second
&gt; thought, before they FUBARed the CAM?

much much more important than what kind of lifters that were used.  in
your 77 I'm pretty sure solid lifters were stock

&gt; I would like to thank you and look foward to your update. You have made me
&gt; rethink my future engine build over and have provided some serious debates
&gt; to going stock.

there are good arguments for each and every method,  as an engineer I
first ask my customer &quot;how they plan on using the product&quot; then work
backwards to find the combination of solutions that will best meet their
needs.   there is rarely if ever a perfect solution, there are only better
compromises.  and each person has to chose which will work best for them

&gt; I would imagine that you both believe that the following is true:
&gt;
&gt; Anything worth doing is worth doing right.

no argument, and remember &quot;better&quot; is the enemy of &quot;good enough&quot;

find the right &quot;good enough&quot; to meet your needs and wallet and enjoy your
bus,

now I guess I ought to disengage from this interesting discussion and go
back to work and at least make like I know what is going on around here
