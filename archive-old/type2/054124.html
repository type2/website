Subject: Re: Oil leaks

I also have an 82 and have had some similar problems, so I'll tell you what 
I've learned.  I apologize in advance if this is a bit long winded.

I went through a couple valve cover gaskets trying to stop a leak.  I then 
went to a local VW shop and asked if they might have any tips.  They claimed 
that the Brazilian gaskets are better than the German ones, this being one 
of the only cases in which the German product is not superior.  So I bought 
a pair and the leak stopped as soon as I put one on.  The only difference I 
can see between the two is that the Brazilian gaskets have a bit more cork 
in them and thus are a bit lighter in color.  I'm not sure if these gaskets 
always work, but they did for me.

As far as the oil cooler goes, I assume you have a 2.0L in which case it's 
not too simple.  When mine was leaking it was the oil cooler and not at the 
gaskets.  If you haven't already, I would suggest getting under the cooler 
with a flashlight while the engine is running to see exactly where the leak 
is coming from.  If it's not the gaskets but the cooler it's self, take care 
of it quick because the leak can get huge quick and threaten your engine.  
Mine dumped about 1qt in a 1/2 mile drive before I realized what was going 
on.
But either way you are in for some work to get at the cooler.  You either 
have to partially drop the engine, or take off the fan shroud to get the 
cooler out, which I assume you would have to do to change the gaskets.  So 
it will cost you a bit of time or $$.  If you do have to take out the 
cooler, have it pressure tested while it's out and make sure it holds 
pressure.  This could save you further headaches down the road.
If it's just the gaskets, there may be some trick to do it easily but I'm 
unaware how to do it.

Hope my babbling helped

&gt;I am brand new to this list and am hoping to tap into your expertise.  I am
&gt;the new(6 months) owner of an 82 Westy...I love it!!
&gt;I just replaced the valve cover gaskets and the driver's side is leaking.  
&gt;I
&gt;have another gasket but was wondering if anyone knows of any tricks for
&gt;preventing a repeat leak.
&gt;It also appears that my oil cooler is leaking.  I have the two gasket for
&gt;that but am not sure if that is a simple fix or not...any thoughts?
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Coop
