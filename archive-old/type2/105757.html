Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel smell and pump

&gt;Hi List,
&gt;
&gt;Just got my '72 camper back on the road after a long hibernation for the
&gt;winter.  I have developed quite a fuel smell after a full fill up at the
gas
&gt;station.  It lasts for about 20 miles or so then disappears until the next
&gt;fill up.  Some folks told me it is the rubber &quot;fuel filler neck&quot;.  I
checked
&gt;a few places and unfortunately they are NLA.. Are there any places to get
&gt;them?  Any alternatives to use?


When I had fuel smells after filling up it turned out to be the o-ring on
the fuel gauge sender.  Cheap part, but hard to get to unless you (or a PO)
have cut an access door in the rear deck.
