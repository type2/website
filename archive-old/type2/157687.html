&gt; Well, call me stupid, but what the heck is an 'oil change gasket set?'
I've changed mine many times and have never bought one.  Maybe that
explains my oil leak.  Or leaks.  That and the pressure sensor.  Thanks,
Dave, for that knowledge.  Cheers...KR

Two round gaskets for the oil screen, six copper washers, and one crush
washer for the drain plug.

In many years of dutifully cleaning the oil screen, I've never found
anything in it, so I only clean it every 10K miles or so.  I change oil
every 2000 miles and a touch of hylomar on the old crush washer makes it
seal just fine.
