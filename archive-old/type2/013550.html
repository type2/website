Subject: Fuel outlet screen blockage (re: Miss, sputter, no gas in fuel filter...)

&gt;&gt;&gt;First, make sure there is gas in the tank. Yes??? Blow air back through
the line. The screen at the outlet could be blocked.&lt;&lt;&lt;

I saw the above excerpt in a reply from Doktor Tim to the &quot;Miss, Sputter,
No Gas In Fuel Filter&quot; thread.  Thinking that I may have a fuel outlet
screen blockage situation in the near future (it's happened before and will
probably again), I was wondering if it is possible to blow air back through
the line without compressed air or something like that.  In other words,
can it be done by just blowing hard on the line with one's mouth?  If so,
is there an extension or something that can be attached to the line coming
from the tank, so that I don't have to schmush my face up under the bus to
try to blow on the thing?  Any insights would be greatly appreciated!
