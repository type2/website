&gt; I dissagree with this. Why then would there be air coming out of my
&gt; heater/defrosters with the heat lever only part way down (fan not activated) at
&gt; anything above 20 mph?

Because the heating system is also fed by the engine fan.  The electric
fan is only there to boost things a bit.

At least this is the way it's set up in stock condition.

My gut feeling is that the engine bay is at slight negative pressure.

The &quot;scoops&quot; on bay window buses are actually pointed more to the side
than the front, so there's little ram-air effect.

Also, the scoops don't extend very far out from the body, so the intake is
in the stagnation region, again with little ram effect

After school starts and i can get to my lab equipment I'll get out a
manometer and test the theory.
