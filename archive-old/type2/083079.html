&gt; &gt; this one is certainly the most attractive, but I'm not happy with the
&gt; &gt; engineering aspects of the installation.  It does nothing to prevent
&gt; &gt; recirculation, which is the usual cause of overheating.  I think that the
&gt; &gt; spare tire arrangement would work fine in motion, but would have problems
&gt; &gt; when moving slowly or stopped.  I note that he used an extremely efficient
&gt; &gt; (and expensive) custom radiator, so he might have enough excess capacity
&gt; &gt; there to overcome recirculation problems.
&gt;
&gt; Oh, he has excess capacity coming out the a**. There's an electric fan on
&gt; it. There's also a secondary radiator under the car with a fan on it.

I didn't know about the secondary radiator.  Was it installed after the
primary to solve a heat problem?  If so, I'd definitely suspect a
recirculation problem, as the primary radiator is huge.  You pretty much
have to have a fan on the radiator in this sort of installation to keep
the air moving while stationary.

It's critical to have some sort of ducting to keep the hot air away from
the air intake.

&gt; &gt; What would work fairly well on an inline 4 is an adaptation of the VW
&gt; Quantum's radiator setup. That engine is so long a radiator in its normal
&gt; position won't fit in the car, so they've set the engine off to the side
&gt; (one halfshaft is longer than the other) and put the radiator next to the
&gt; engine.
&gt;
&gt; Hobart Kennedy does say that purging the air out of your coolant lines is
&gt; the hardest part of a front-mounted radiator setup. You'd be stuck with this
&gt; problem even in a watercooled Vanagon conversion.

That's why I like the radiator in the engine bay arrangement.  If you are
good about bleeding the system, a burp tank seems to work well.  I wonder
how they did it with the watercooled baywindows in Mexico?
