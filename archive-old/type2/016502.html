Subject: BN4

Volks:
A cold, snowy winter is forecast for the midwest, and
I've got a perfectly good BN-4 sitting in my closet
here.  It's probably time to think about installing it.
 As far as the electrical/gas installation goes, I'm
lucky enough to have all the manuals; however, I'm
unsure about what to do with the ductwork.  Charles
Miller fitted it with a way of using warm cabin air, so
I need a plan to duct the hot air, warm air in, and the
muffler/intake install in the rear.  I read the
excellent article in the archives, but I still wonder
if anyone has any templates for where the holes should
be made.  

Am I correct in assuming I'll have to pull the engine
to do this?
Any advice would be appreciated.

TIA,
