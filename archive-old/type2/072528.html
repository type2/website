I am being offered a 1982 Vanagon Westfalia, with 145,000 original miles.
Body/interior is in very good shape, just very dirty. The car has been sitting for over 2 years. It needs an engine. I could either rebuild what it has now, or replace the whole motor. The 4 speed stick shift tranny is supposedly in good condition. The guy tells me to &quot;make him an offer&quot; . What would be a reasonable price for this thing?? How much are the motors for this thing?? Should I wait for a 1977-1979 Westfalia instead??
