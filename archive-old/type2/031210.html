Have you considered &quot;TufTred&quot; this stuff is fantastic, it is a fibreglasss
impregnated marine plywood.  this stuff isn't cheap but it is impervious
to everything and doesn't hold water, little hard to find too, I know a
source in the Mid Atlantic (Harbor Sales in Annapolis MD) sorry don't know
about the rest of the country.
