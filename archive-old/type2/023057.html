I have to retighten mine every couple of weeks.  They simply come loose on 
their own.  Can't tighten them too much because the piece they are screwing 
into is plastic, and will crack (even the chrome ones are just 
chrome-plated plastic).  I don't believe this has ever been discussed on 
this list before - anyone have a solution to this problem?  I'm thinking 
loctite might be worth a shot.
