Mount the small propeller and alternator with built in regulator to a beefy frame work just ahead of the spare tire carrier on the front of the bus.  Now, that is a sight I'd
like to see.

Why not just use a 20 amp toggle switch to manually connect the Positive side to your alternator.  Throw switch to connect when your engine is running, and manually disconnect
and isolate the extra one you are counting on to start your bus.

Keep smiling,

Mike
