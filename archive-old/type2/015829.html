Is it really illegal?  Assuming Lealon owns a '71 bus, isn't the owner
entitled to posess an owners manual for their bus?  I wouldn't think VW
would care if someone photocopied a manual for this purpose.  

Photocopying a Bentley or other service manual would of course be a no-no
(except for your own personal use).
