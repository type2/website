Subject: Points and fuel pump question
Mime-Version: 1.0

Volks- Should you see the points sparking if you take the distributor cap 
off while someone is cranking the engine? I know that the points are 
supposed to complete the circuit and send the charge from the coil to the 
plugs at the right time, and so I am wondering if the sparking I am seeing 
is actually arcing, causing the plugs to fire at the wrong time and 
generally keep the engine from running.
And when buying a new fuel pump for a 1500cc engine with a generator, are 
the pumps that fit a 1600 the correct fit and all? Anything I need to watch 
out for?
Thanks, thanks, thanks.
