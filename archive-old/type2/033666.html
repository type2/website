&gt; Paul -

&gt; I'm surprised that you were able to keep all of that frustration pent up
&gt; inside, instead of &quot;flipping him off&quot;!! That would'a taught 'em better
than
&gt; to be friendly...
&gt;
&gt; I missed a dome-top bus going the other way this morning because I had to
&gt; watch out for, of all things, traffic. I hope he/she forgives my momentary
&gt; lack of prudence.
&gt;
&gt; Enjoy -

&gt; &gt; The streak was broken today _at_3 pm when an aircooled Westy Vanagon
actually
&gt; &gt; waved _at_ me first!
