Excellent! So please forget my earlier theory, although you may still want
to check for other vacuum leaks. In particular, check all your hoses for
cracks.

Replace your coil and see if that fixes your problem. (Hot coils sometimes
do behave that way.)

If the problem still persists, then check out the FI troubleshooter at

Good luck,
