Subject: How to connect starter

I wrote earlier about a haunted started but didn't much of a response.

I have a 73 westy that I just installed a new rebuilt starter. How do you
connect it up? I thought that all the eye loop connections including the
battery go to the ignition post. That is how I connected it, but now when
connected to power, it starts right away without the key. My question is, do
any of the eye loop connections go to the post(the other post with a nut)
that connects the solenoid to starter?  Please advise because now I am
starting to think that the starter is malfunctioning.
