Subject: Canvas Replacement Idea

Here's an idea for thought.  I was considering having a local repair/sew
shop  use my existing canvas as a pattern and use a nylon material
(similar to tent fabric) to fabricate a replacement piece of canvas.  My
thought is that the nylon would be a better insulator against the wind
than the canvas.  In the winter at 10,000 feet, the wind can be pretty
strong and darn right cold at night.  Anyone see any obvious flaws with
this idea.  If you're interested in what I find out, let me know.

Does a pattern exist for the canvas already????
