Subject: RE: engine dies in reverse

&gt; Subject: engine dies in reverse
&gt; Changed the points and condensor, set the timing, went out for a spin.
&gt; Ended up at a nearby lake, played with my son for a while, went to back
&gt; it out of its parking space and it DIED when I put it in reverse.
&gt; 
&gt; My 4 year old son was saying &quot;we're never going to get home&quot; while I
&gt; slid under the bus and yanked one of the wires going to the reverse
&gt; light switch. Started it up, put it in reverse, backed out, drove home.
&gt; 
&gt; Weird error. Why would a short circuit cause the bus to die? With its
&gt; nice new points and condensor?
&gt; 
	[]  The backup lights on my bus are powered from hot side of the
	coil through a wire with a fuse holder. Two possibilities come to
mind:
	You've put the backup light supply  wire on the wrong (points) side
of the coil, 
	so when you put it in reverse, the backuplights are 
	semi grounding the coil's points side terminal, so when your points
open, 
	the current continues to flow through backup lights through the
coil, so no spark.

	Less likely: the backup light fuse is replaced by a wire, 
	AND you have short in your backup
	lights that ground out the hot side of the coil when you 
	put it in reverse. If this is the case, it should blow the ignition
	fuse if there is one, or could eventually fry the wire supplying the
coil.
