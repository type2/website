Subject: Re: [T2] RE: 69 overhead storage

 
&gt; My '69 is a pop-top.  Check it out at:
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.geocities_dot_com/thegreatjose/VW/69bus.html
&gt; 
&gt; I think the '69 models either came with the net or nothing at all.  I don't 
&gt; think the shelf was introduced until the 1970 non pop-top models.

I looked at the Westy manuals on your site. 68 also has the net:

70 pop tops have the shelf:

But NONE of the manuals mention non-pop top Westies. I know they were 
made but I don't know why they don't talk about them.

I am VERY confused about the pics on this page:

http://www.i405_dot_com/vw/tech/70Westy/page8.jpg

The left one seems to show a hook for the cargo net above and forward of
the side cabinet door. But the right pic shows the upper shelf, that SHOULD 
have been in the left pic.
