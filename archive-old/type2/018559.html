&gt;&gt;From my experience with EGR on other
&gt;cars, it should not be active at idle.

&gt;In other words it should not change the
&gt;idle when disconnected vs. connected.
&gt;It should only work during part throttle
&gt;acceleration.  I would guess that the valve
&gt;is sticking, or that you have it hooked
&gt;up to the wrong kind of vacuum port.

I agree, David, but think we now have to make a distinction between
types of EGR valves.  The '78 2.0 has a strictly mechanical EGR
activation via direct linkage to the throttle bellcrank, and I think
other late loafs used an electrically actuated EGR valve.

I think vacuum would be a potential factor only if

  a) the valve was vacuum operated,

or

  b) if the EGR valve was simply rendered inactive but left in place
     and not blocked off, and the EGR valve itself leaked.
