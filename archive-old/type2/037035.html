Subject: Re: Stopping at a rest stop

     I have had good luck in parking at boat ramps overnight...folks think 
you are there for early fishing.  Also the parking lots of County Hospitals 
is a good bet...they think your out of state plate means you are there to see 
Uncle Fred off.  Have spent many nights in Wally-World parking lots (but they 
can be awfully bright), truck stops across America (watch out for reefers 
running all night...the noise and fumes can get ya).  Try to park in such a  
way that you can gets going if you have to without  taking time to back &amp; 
fill or even lower the top.  I don't think I will be doing much more of this 
until I get a cell phone ( and I don't usually go anywhere without packing)...
O mores, O tempores....
