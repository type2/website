Hello John  What part of the tower is broken  the top??  did it break 
completely off or just where the shock goes thur   ?    The bottom section there are 
repair kits for that weld on  I have repaired the top before using real big 
heavy washers.   I have some extras here but that is a good distance away   
There are also some differences in the tie rod ends but wont matter if you get a 
complete axle   later and have fun  Mark Dearing
