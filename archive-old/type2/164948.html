Subject: Re: [T2] I AM GOING TO SCREAM!!!!!!! or cry

Knowing damn little about VW motors.................could the pushrod be the wrong length?

&gt; &gt; Do you think you got the valves adjusted correctly? Valves not closing 
&gt; &gt; all the way could cause a problem like that. 
&gt; 
&gt; have readjusted them loose, tight, very loose, very tight and everywhere 
&gt; in between!! 

Sometimes the stupid comments lead to the solution, I was sold pushrods the wrong length once for a Ford 429 with hydraulic lifters and my valves wouldn't close.
