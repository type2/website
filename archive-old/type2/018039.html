laying in the street at one am last night trying to make the hydralic brake 
connections to my new master cylinder, and frustrated, allowed myself to be 
less than fastidious with the safety goggles, I got something in my eye. It's 
happened 
countless times before and I can usually fish out the large speck of corroded 
metal with a tissue. This time it was the real
deal. After spending a less than restful night, I just got back from having a 
minor surgical procedure done - having a chard
of steel removed - it was embedded in my eyeball. Don't let this happen to 
you, wear your goggles no matter how 
trivial the job may appear.
