Subject: Re: [T2] Brake light on the dash

Hiya Austin,

That light should come on when the switch on the master cylinder detects one 
of the brake circuits going out.  So, should you be concerned?  Yes, of 
course.  Of all the systems on the Bus, you need to be able to count on your brakes.

But is it actually a problem with the master cylinder?  Is one of your brake 
circuits going out?  Likely not.  But before you crawl around and check, 
prepare for the worst.  Since you had brake work done recently it would be a good 
idea to do a close visual on the master cylinder.  Is the wiring to the 
switches all in good shape. You might want to trace those wires and look for problem 
areas.

And you'll want to look under the dash at your brake warning light.  Is it 
wired to specs as per Bentley?  Seems strange to me that it was only on when 
your lights were out.  That says something may be screwy with your wiring.
