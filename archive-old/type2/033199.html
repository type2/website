Subject: RE: Type4: Which Exhaust?

&gt; Ron at Bus Depot lists 3 exhaust kits for Type4 buses with
&gt; oval-port heads: two 72-74 kits (regular and stainless) and a 75-78
regular. I'm at a loss
&gt; to figure out why these are differentiated by these year ranges,
&gt;
&gt; I don't plan to have a catalytic converter on the bus: is *that* why the
&gt; 75-78 is different--to accomodate the catalytic converter?



No, only the '79 was cat-equipped in all 50 states ('76-79 in California),
and in fact none of the kits you mention above accepts a cat.  The
difference between the years relates to the shape of the flanges from the
heat exchangers to the exhaust system. 72-74 and 79 heat exchangers had
trapezoidal flanges for the exhaust, whereas '75-78 had triangular.  If you
use the correct heat exchangers for the exhaust system chosen (i.e. 72-74
heat exchangers if you have a '72-74 or 79 exhaust, or 75-78 heat exchangers
if you have a '75-78 exhaust) you can use any exhaust/heat exchanger setup
on any year '72-79.  My advice would be to use 72-74 heat exchangers and the
stainless steel muffler, which is far superior to every other alternative in
terms of durability and simplicity, and a real bargain at the price. (I also
have right-side German NOS 72-74 heat exchangers at a bargain price of
$149.) I should note, however, that only the external muffler body is
stainless (the flanges, tailpipe, hardware etc. are not) and that this
system does not have an output for an egr valve (or cat). The '75-78 option
is a Mexican Pacesetter system, which is far less durable although
relatively stock in look and sound.
