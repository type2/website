Subject: [T2] looking for guru in D.C.

Volks-
This is my first time writing the list, just got the '71 Westy three weeks 
ago, my first vehicle. I'm looking for someone in the D.C. area who can give 
advice/help with my bus in exchange for beer, whatever help I can offer w/ 
your bus, etc. I know learning is best done doing, but mechanically inclined 
I am not. Today I tried to take the sliding door off, and got as far as the 
first screw, which I was unable to unscrew due to rust. Yikes! The bus is in 
good shape but needs a few minor repairs (i.e., parking break, aux heater). 
Thanks in advance,


Sean
'71 Westy
