Subject: RE:  Temp. Sensor II
Message-ID: &lt;D3C18AEA0EA1D111B8DA00805F85E889011F8FE5_at_dsntexsrv3.diasham_dot_com&gt;

&gt;Here's a question for those with Fuel Injection?  I have a 78 2.0L 
&gt;whose temperature sensor II is located on cylinder #2 as opposed 
&gt;to cylinder #3.

During the last rebuild, some genius got the heads mixed up and put the 1-2
head on the 3-4 side and visa-versa (ask me why I'm certain about that!).  

&gt;Is this an issue?  

The #3 cylinder should be the hottest one since it is furthest from the
cooling fan AND has the oil cooler on that side.  

&gt;Could this cause a problem for the ECU?   I would simply move the 
&gt;sensor, but the boss for cylinder  #3 is too small.

I don't think it would present much of a problem.  The worst thing it would
do is tell the ECU to run a slightly richer mixture until the sensor got
completely warmed up (which doesn't take that long anyway).  I can't say for
sure, but I believe the temp sensor II will reach its 100 ohm range (hot
engine) at about 200 degrees Fahrenheit or less.  And I expect your #1-2
head temps would be that hot or hotter most the time.
