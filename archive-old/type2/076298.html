Subject: Getting locks squared away

Hey all,
         First if all I want to thank all of you that gave me the helpful 
answers to my problem with my engine stalling out when I shitfed into 
reverse. Even though it was a simple fix I would have had no clue how to fix 
it, but anyway I digress.
         My problem is that I am moving to vancouver as some of you may 
remember. I need to get a locking latch for my engine and the back door 
above it. I would also like to have all the doors work with one key.But the 
handles have been changed by the previous owner and I dont have the keys. 
Does any one know where I can get the lock inserts for the two front doors, 
the slider and the back door; if it can be changed? The door to the engine 
compartment does not even have a lock on it so I would like to get a whole 
new assemble for that. If you guys have tips on installing or know where I 
can pick some up cheap please let me know....
                     Thanks,
                          Travis    &quot;Direwolf&quot;
                          78 westy
