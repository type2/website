Subject: RE:  Getting hot while sitting still

&gt;Howdy. I bought a '74 hardtop a few months ago, with the stock 
&gt;1800 pancake/dual carbs, and have noticed a discrepancy with 
&gt;the old dipstick grab-with-yer-fingers oil temp test. I've noticed 
&gt;that while pulling into a gas station and scurrying round the back 
&gt;in a hurry, things seem docile. However, after pumping gas and 
&gt;buying a drink, the stick's temperature seems to go up markedly. 

Just for kicks, I bought one of those little indoor/outdoor thermometers
from JC Whipme just before my 2800 mile trek to/from Jerome.  I
installed the outdoor sensor in my engine compartment - just stuck it to
the metal wall that covers the gas tank and ran the wires as far forward
as they'd reach (which put the read-out hanging over the bulkhead just
behind the driver's seat).  

Now I can monitor the air temps inside my engine compartment.

Here's what I found:  
 -- Under most driving conditions the engine compartment air temps
tended to be 6-10 degrees F. warmer than the air temps inside the cabin
of the bus (typically inside the bus is the same temp as the outside
air).

 -- Under severely hot conditions (100 degrees +), the engine
compartment temps climbed as high as 10-12 degrees warmer (that was at
65 mph, 3800 rpm).

 -- Unless I was sitting at a stoplight, surrounded by other cars, the
temps didn't tend to vary for intown vs highway driving.

 -- When I stopped for gas with the engine off and the bus sat for a few
minutes (this is after hours of highway driving), the engine compartment
air temp would rise above the 120 degree limit of the thermometer.  Even
when the outside air was only in the low 70's.  Within a minutes (or
less) of driving, the temp would drop back down to it's typical 6-10
degrees above outside air.  (BTW, my engine seal is in place and in good
shape.)

I don't know exactly what all this means, I just thought I'd throw it
out there for you temperature nuts.

Peace!
