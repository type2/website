&gt; &gt; &lt;...huh?? my psi NEVER gets under 37psi even at idle, you mean I have never
&gt; &gt; used my oil cooler...&gt; Bob,  37psi_at_ hot idle? Might check your gauge. And
&gt; &gt; yes, VW spec for the Single Relief Valve Type2 2.0L is 35-38psi, bypasses
&gt; &gt; the oil cooler at higher pressures. If it didn't, bye-bye cooler seals.
&gt; &gt; BTW, I don't think even Jake Raby's Bad A$$ Type2's pull 30+psi hot.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;...not always, at idle I lift the relief valve at 65 or so psi and can't
&gt; remember it ever being below 40psi no matter what the temp.  now I will
&gt; admit when the engine was rebuilt we honed a new oil pump to almost
&gt; perfect spec...&gt; I'd still check the calibration on that oil pressure gauge,

that is my real concern is that the gauge may be off, but I don't take it
literal so much as relative and if it started reading higher or lower than
I'm used to seeing it would serve as an alert

&gt; &lt;...and I had a 71 off the showroom floor...ran it hard and it dropped a rod
&gt; at 112k...&gt; Upright Type1 engine vs. Type4 engine. kinda like comparing
&gt; apples to bowling balls.

no argument about the difference, but the comment was about how VW built
em and intended for them to be used. and your right, I don't think I would
ever have a type I engine after having type IV engines

&gt; &lt;...just got back from a week long 1,200 mile trip into the Anarondack
&gt; mountains in upstate NY, and a long drive down I-95 on the way home from
&gt; Boston to Baltimore in about 8 hours, stopped only for gas meet me at
&gt; everrybus and look at the guage as I pull in if you don't believe me,
&gt; should arrive early afternoon Fri if the auto tranny holds up...&gt; Look
&gt; forward to meeting you. I'm the guy with too many tattoos and a Westy with
&gt; too many light, and an HDTV antenna bolted to the safari rack.

hope to see you also, I have the blue/white that is being carried around
under a big canoe....

&gt; Have a safe trip amigo,

same to you
