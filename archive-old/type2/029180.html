I spent my entire evening last night replacing the fuel tank sending unit.
It sucked.  Really.  I read the tech article in the library where it sounds
easy and painless to remove the tank to replace the sender and I'm
convinced that those people have forgotten what a PITA it was.  How are you
supposed to remove that lower firewall piece in front of the motor without
dropping the motor?  Mine has a bunch of stuff running through it.  Anyway,
on with the story...

I spent about an hour trying to track down a suitable siphon to remove the
old gas with little success.  The one I did find at Wal-Mart was about
useless.  The plastic tubing would curl up and didn't really reach into the
bottom of the tank.  I had better luck when I combined a Home Depot siphon
with this one with some stretchy rubber tape.  I managed to siphon what I
thought was all the gas out of the bus into another car so I thought I was
good to go.

I crawled under the bus and spent about 30 minutes locating the nuts
connected to the bolts on the fuel tank hold-down straps.  Finally found
them and proceeded to remove them using a 10&quot; swivel extension + an 8&quot;
swivel extension.  I remember doing this in my 67 and I swear the nuts were
inside the engine compartment.  Whatever.  Anybody see X-men?  Remember the
dude that got turned into a mutant and could squeeze between bars and
stuff?  That was me.  I had my arms stuffed up through stuff and around
stuff to get leverage on these freakin nuts.  I'm really wishing I would
have just cut the damn hole in the bus instead of doing this.  Ok, removed
the nuts and the straps are hanging loosely.  Pulled out the plastic vapor
tubes and loosened the straps on the rubber coupling between the tank and
the fill tube.  Things are going smoothly at this point and I had assumed
that the worst (removing the nuts underneath the bus) was behind me.  I had
clamped a vice-grips on the fuel line right before the fuel filter figuring
that there would be some residual fuel in the tank.  Well if you've ever
replaced the fuel filter you know home much fun that is.  I pulled the hose
out of the filter and gas shot everywhere:  up my nose, in my eyes, in my
mouth, in my ear, you name it.  I was concerned about the gas leaking onto
the ground so I mopped up as much as I could with my hair before stuffing
the end of the siphon hose into the loose fuel line.  Yes, the Wal-Mart
siphon tubing is basically glorified fish-tank tubing so it fits snugly
inside the stock fuel line.  I blinked about a million times before
realizing that the gas in my eyes was there for good.  I went into the
house and ran water into my eyes for a bit until the extreme stinging went
away.  Ok, back outside where the bus sits, waiting for me to throw a match
at it.  I would have but my girlfriend's car was parked right next to it.
Damn the luck.  Turns out there was about 4 gallons more fuel in the tank
than I thought.  No problem, I'll just siphon all that out into my 2.2
gallon gas can.  Doh!  Luckily my oil-change pan was laying next to the
bus.  Now it's a gas/oil change pan.

At this point in the procedure I decided to grab a beverage and sit in my
driveway enjoying the cool sensations of gasoline evaporating off my body.
Ahhhh.  I removed the remaining fuel lines from underneath the bus and
prepared to remove or disloge the tank.  I didn't care which.  Yesterday I
spent a little time removing the majority of the FI stuff that would get in
the way of the tank before I removed the upper firewall in front of the
engine (FiF).  I thought about logging onto the Type2 archives to research
how other people had done the tank removal but then I remembered that
gasoline would dissolve the keys on my PC so I decided not to bother.  I
wiggled, pried, tugged, begged, yanked, you name it on the tank but I
couldn't get it more than 60-70% out into the engine compartment.  Luckily
I pulled it far enough out so I could reach the sender unit through the
engine access panel.  I turned the old one and proudly removed it.  I even
felt a little smug satisfaction at this point knowing that I had made it
through the worst (yeah, right) part of the procedure.  Well, in my haste
to remove it I didn't bother to check what wire went where or even what
direction I had turned the thing.  I guessed on the wires (ground to the
terminal right on top of the sender, the other wire to the terminal
insulated by plastic, right?) and realized that the sender only went into
the tank one way.  Unfortunately the new o-ring was too damn thick and I
couldn't make the sender fit using it.  Believe me, I tried.  I was using
the handle of a channel-lock pliers in the notches on either side of the
sender to turn it while standing on it to push it down and it still
wouldn't go in.  Yes, standing in the back of the bus with my foot in the
engine access panel.  I'm only 40 inches tall.  Ok, I'm 40 inches tall when
I'm really hunched over.  At this point I was thinking about getting that
match but I decided to use the old o-ring and it went back in.  I'm sure
that will come back to haunt somebody someday...

Yes!  New sender is in things are looking good, piece of cake, wrap this up
in like 20 minutes, etc.  Oh sure.  Spent about 20 minutes wiggling that
damn rubber coupling back between the tank and filler neck and tightened
the clamps down.  It's turned a bit differently than it was but it's in
there.  After doing that I checked to see if I could still screw the gas
cap thingy back into the bus.  Nope.  Double-doh!  Loosened the clamps on
the coupling and wiggled everything around until I could screw that thing
back down THEN I put the coupling back into place.  I put the little
plastic vapor hoses back on and then looked at the straps holding the tank
down and briefly thought about just ignoring them.  Then I remembered
reading in Haynes that I should take great care tightening the straps and
the importance of getting the tank in exactly the same spot because it can
weigh a hundredweight when full.  What the hell is a hundredweight?  I
didn't know so I got back under the bus and tightened the nuts back up.
Remember a couple of paragraphs ago when I complained about how much fun
the nut removal process was?  Installation is the opposite of removal.

I replaced all the rubber fuel lines under the bus (thankfully I had some
left over from a previous job because none of the Crap Auto stores I
stopped at had any) and connected everything back up.  Just when I thought
I was home free I remembered I needed to replace the fuel filter.  I had
already siphoned out the gas so this should be a snap.  Pulled the filter
down to loosen the hose clamp and splish splash one more time with the
gasoline facial.  Oh yes.  Since I like the way gas feels in my skin I
ignored that and continued with the filter replacement.  I picked up all my
tools and parts and filled the tank with the 2.2 gallons of gas that stayed
in the gas can.  No leaks then or this morning so I feel ok so far.  Of
course I haven't actually turned the key to pressurize the system because I
haven't replaced the upper firewall and I haven't reassembled the FI
system.  Details, details.

So if you read all this you must be as bored at work as I am or you are
pondering your own fuel tank sender replacement.  My advice to you
is...don't!  Either cut the hole or pay some other schmo to do it.  I have
to confess though that I do have some perverse sense of satisfaction
knowing that I completed the task.  Either that or it's all the gas fumes I
inhaled.
