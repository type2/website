Subject: metric camper top hardware

Volks,

I just painted my pop top with yacht enamel. I would like to replace all
the hardware. Does anyone know where I could purchace the replacements? I
would like to order some sort of complete kit b/c I am not sure of the
exact sizes of the carriage bolts etc.
Thanks,
