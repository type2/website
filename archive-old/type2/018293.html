&gt; In regard to your observation of only a few buses and most owners
&gt; being &quot;very stereotypical&quot;  . . . .

&gt; That those you saw are &quot;stereotypical&quot; (meaning pleasantly laid
&gt; back, one assumes?) would not surprise me in such a place, but
&gt; it's not necessarily representative of the bus drivers in the rest of
&gt; the States.  Generalization of that sort reads a bit on the negative
&gt; side, and I'd hate to think you went home under the assumption that
&gt; the only folks in America still driving buses are wearing love beads!
&gt; 
&gt; It's a BIG country, and marvelously diverse.
