&gt; I am considering buying the engine stand that the bus depot has for my
&gt; type4 and I wanted to get input from others that have used it.  Can I
&gt; mount the flywheel on the engine with the stand still attached?  I have
&gt; a generic stand now that sucks because you have to adjust the arms to
&gt; match the holes and it's just a nightmare... plus I'd have to take the
&gt; engine off of the generic stand to attach the flywheel and clutch..
&gt;
&gt; Any other good/bad points?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
