If the '73 is basically straight like the '70 I can sell you a foot of good
stuff for about $10, exactly what I have in it, but mine is a Gates product
with a wire reinforcement that makes it a pain to bend, I used it
sucessfully on the '78 but it really didn't want to make the even slight
turn the factory bent hose does.  However the wire keeps it from collapsing.
Gates also had a lighter product without wire that would have been dandy but
my local industrial supply place had this in stock, not the other.  I had to
buy 3' for $10 per.  Works beautifully on the '70 single cab with a straight
run.  A few years back someone had a source from some offroad buggy supplier
for a wonderful accordion style urethane hose that made even a sharp turn
easily without collapse but the place he mentioned went out of business and
I've called some of the buggy places looking without sucess.  Problem is
this is a real oddball size, 57mm ~ 2.25&quot; I think, real uncommon.  Short of
nothing else the stuff I used is much better than a firebomb bus, I simply
didn't like the strain it put on the filler elbow on the '78, but on the '70
its perfect.  Any way round you need a gasoline rated hose, nitrile rubber
formulation, nothing else will take it.  For instance the stuff at the local
home store for quick repair of drain pipes will melt, RAPIDLY.  I've looked
at a regular smattering of sources, Aeroquip, etc and only Gates had a
nitrile hose in the correct ID.
