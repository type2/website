Subject: Re: [T2] Ball joint replacement

Mike,

there is a ton of info in the archives on this.  browse through all of that
&amp; if you have specific questions let me know.

&amp; yes, you heard correctly - this job can be a real PITA.  i've done it
before, but if i had to do it over again, i would probably just shell out
the $ to a competent mechanic. just MHO.

good luck,

Joel Wilson
