Subject: Last call for free 1700 heads

I got rid of the gauge cluster but still have the pair of rebuildable ( I think) 1700 heads. So far no one has expressed any interest. If I dont hear from anyone by tomorrow I am going to pitch them. To clarify these are 2 1700 heads used. One has cracks by both exhaust valves the other I could not find any cracks but that does not mean there are none. Free to good home. I dont want to ship so come and get them in Annapolis, MD.
