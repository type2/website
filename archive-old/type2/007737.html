Tim -

Well, I just asked for help so I'll try and offer a litle here.

When putting my 2.0 liter back in for the second time, and after about 30 minutes of engine jiggling, we figured out the following HUGE TRICK!

Try putting a jack under the transmission to keep it from moving.  With every jiggle before the jack, the transmission would move another way and there was no easy way to get everything aligned. After the jack was there, it slid right on. I don't think this was luck because it worked twice!

Also having clutch plate lined up, and your spline super clean and slightly lubed helps.

Eric
