Subject: CA smog: another approach

Maybe so, George, but I don't remember seeing you standing by as *we* 
ran the tests and calculated the mileage. Or, did you buy a certified 
tester and the test vials? What were your findings? :-)

It is interesting that some folks can be so sure of their prejudices 
even when they are entirely without evidence.

Carry on, George, and thanks for the magnet links.

Cheers/Fader
BTW, the magnets worked *very well* on my home water supply, stopping so 
much mineral fouling that I had to remove that section of supply pipe 
about twice a year and clean it out because the fouling stopped water flow.

 &gt;&gt;George sez:

 &gt;&gt;Well, I'll weigh in here and say that this is pure poppycock, but if you
 &gt;&gt;want to play with the idea and need magnets,
