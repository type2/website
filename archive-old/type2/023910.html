&gt; has thought about &quot;wind power&quot; to charge a battery.  
&gt; windmills can do a good job of supply electricity to a
&gt; home so why not some type of turbine, wind powered
&gt; generator on a bus.   driving down the road would
&gt; cause it to turn and could charge a couple batteries
&gt; for camp.

&lt;snip&gt;

I believe they often use a windmill on board 
sailing yachts.  These have the advantage of 
being pivoted to face the wind, so they'd be 
good for when you're parked up too.

I don't know where you are, (maybe a long way
from the ocean !)  But check out some boat
suppliers/chandlers.

I don't suppose you'd get much current from a
setup like this, but it would be &quot;free&quot; power

Of course, this might look quite strange on a 
bus, but I *like* the idea.
