Subject: Re: [T2] Balancing wide 5's.

I had that option locally but didn't want it. Why? I picture having to keep
the wheel on the same location and same lug position to maintain balancing.
Not sure if that's true or not but sounds like a hassle. Also, they were
telling me they couldn't do the back wheels for some reason. Tom




&gt; I've got my wide 5 balancing problems solved.

&lt;Tom,

You can also go to a shop that balances the wheels/tires on the vehicle.
