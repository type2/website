Subject: Re: [T2] VW Camper &amp; Bus Magazine is Here!

But, are you sure it's in English??  I might have to use the translator in the front of my Jaguar book.  Cheers...KR

The Bus Depot &lt;type2_at_busdepot_dot_com&gt; wrote:  Just a note that I now have more issues of the U.K. published &quot;VW Camper &amp;
Bus&quot; magazine in stock.  To my knowledge it is the only English language
magazine exclusively devoted to VW busses, vans and campers. It's a
fascinating read, and a &quot;must-read&quot; for Bus enthusiasts. There are tons of
tech articles, pictorials, buying guides, info on camper conversions never
found in the U.S., and more. Each issue is about 100 pages.

I had previously brought in some copies of Issue 2 and they sold out very
quickly. This time the publisher gave us a good deal on 3 issues (issues 2,
3, and 4), so I can actually sell them for below the cover price in England.
This is the last time these issues will be offered.

The price is $4.50 for issue 2 (which is the one I had before, if you missed
it), $7.50 for issue 3, and $8.75 for issue 4. Postage is about $4 for one
issue, but stays nearly the same even if you add a 2nd or 3rd issue. (Or if
you add them to an existing parts order, the incremental shipping cost for
the magazine is negligable.)

We have only a limited number of each issue, so it will be first come, first
served. As they sell out I will pull them from the website. This magazine is
well worth reading if you haven't had the pleasure yet. Especially if you're
already placing a parts order anyway, I highly recommend adding at least one
of these to your cart.
