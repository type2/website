Subject: '81 Vanagon engine stumble

   I put a new long block in my '81 Vanagon a couple of weeks ago.

   Today I experienced some problems with the running of the engine
   and I'm hoping that the group can help.  After just a mile or two
   or driving the engine began to hesitate and &quot;stumble&quot; after each
   shift (lower rpm's, moderate throttle) and it didn't want to &quot;pick
   up&quot; from idle.

   With the installation of the new engine I put in all new plugs, plug
   wires, rotor and rotor cap.  I previously checked the coil with my
   meter, and primary and secondary wiring were within spec.  I timed the
   engine shortly after installation.

   When I got home today I checked for vacuum problems (propane torch
   pointed at all the hoses, connections, etc.) and everything seemed OK.

   Could compression problems cause this sort of problem?  (I'm a little
   leery of the engine but I don't have a compression gauge.)

   Any fairly obvious things to check on the fuel injection?

   Thanks for any and all help
