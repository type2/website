Subject: turn signal problems.

&quot;in addition when I push 
the
brakes, while the right signal is on, the rear lights
stop flashing 
altogether
(again it works normally when I use the left signal
with brakes&quot;


Id check to see what the wires at the tail look like.
I had the brake stops the turn signal problem and it
was caused by corrosion on the contacts. I wouldnt be
surprised if some genius spliced the left and right
turn signals together (Ive seen stranger) also try
replacing the turn signal relay. (after taking apart
the rear lights an cleaning all the contacts.)

I hate electrical work (it took me a half day of work
and two days of thinking to install my CDI, which
would take a normal person half an hour.). So what  I
do is take one rear lamp apart at a time so I can
reassemble it using the other lamp as a guide.
