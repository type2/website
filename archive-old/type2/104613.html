&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone ever dealt with &quot;Air Cooled Classics Porsche&quot; in Knoxville, TN?
&gt; The guy seemed very curteous and knowledgable on the phone-- He said he could
&gt; help me untangle in my mind how I want to build my 72 Westy's engine.  I'll
&gt; be doing the work myself, but was wondering if I should listen to him-- his
&gt; is the only shop I've found close by that can do machining on type 4 engines.

Gather your own information first. Then, listen to him.  Next, armed with
what he's said, compare his information to yours.  Next, check the list
archives and compare what you find there to his information and
yours....then, once you're settled on what you think you'd like to do, ask
the list!
