Subject: Re: [T2] welding and gas tank

Pull it and be sure you don't burn up your neighbor or your bus.

It's a good time to replace all the rubber hoses too.


&gt;I have a 71 Westy with rust around the rear wheels. A
&gt;guy who welds out of his garage nearby has offered to
&gt;patch in some new metal for what seems to be a
&gt;reasonable fee. He wants the gas tank out to do the
&gt;work. I can see his point =97 fire, gas, kablooey =97 but
&gt;I wonder if this is the standard procedure. I'm not
&gt;aching to pull the engine and tank if it's not
&gt;necessary. Opinions? Thanks. Tony Schmitz
