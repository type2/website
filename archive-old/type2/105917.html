Subject: CF&amp;Son Bus Repro Projects

My high school friend's dad flies anti-weed helicopter missions
in santa cruz (buddie's a stoner of course) and he got a military
chopper joystick to put on the gearshift in his Thing.

Pretty hot, I always told him to wire stuff up to the triggers.

&gt;I got tired of shifting without a knob on the shaft.  G had a 50 &gt;lb. chrome skull on the shaft and it was making the shifter a &gt;deadly weapon in turns...
