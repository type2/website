&gt;Happy Freitag ..
&gt;
&gt;Anyone had experience with running a VW (or other air-cooled) motor on 
&gt;straight
&gt;ethanol?  Re-jetting is prob. involved; other considerations?  Thanks.

the Brazilians have been running their VWs on pure ethanol for 
decades....they have lots of sugar cane, but little oil reserves....at least 
they aren't dependant on arbitrary global oil price fixing....i think the 
float in the carb has to be readjusted for the different specific 
gravity...also, i think ethanol doesn't vaporize well below like 50F (no 
prob in Brazil)...something about the pistons too...maybe domed for higher 
compression....i remember JC whitney sold ethanol pistons in the 70's...i 
always wondered what they were for unless someone had a still in their 
woodlot....
