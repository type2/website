Well, not really cold - I'm in Texas!  Background: my 77 FI van runs great.
I installed a hot start relay and was testing it, starting up (good),
shutting down, starting up (good), shutting down, starting up - and it just
cranked and cranked.  I went back and checked for a popped off hose - none.
After a while I tried disconnected the cyl temp sensor and it started right
up albeit smokey, so I hooked the sensor back up and it roars to life.  Runs
great, shut it down, starts right up.  Then I shut it down and let the
engine cool and it just cranks and cranks - same sinario.  I checked the
resistance of my cyl temp sensor (it's fairly new) - 4k ohms at probably
60F.  What could be going on?  Any ideas?

Thanks in advance!!
