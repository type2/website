Subject: trip report Utah

Beautiful weather, good friends. 
All in all, a fine trip and bus performed perfectly.
(Probably sensed I am fed up with side-of-the-road
dramas.)

Had one breakdown, which I consider minor. I had
installed new points/condensor/plugs/wires/rotor/cap
but the new bosch condenser turned out to be bad.
Who'da thunk it?
I couldn't get a replacement before the trip, so I put
the old one back in and everything was fine. But, on
the homeward leg, the bus started missing then go,
stop, go, stop. 

Turned out the old condenser's wires were shorting
out.

I taped the wires to get to the nearest part store,
Aut*Z*ne. I was amazed they had a condensor for my
bus-- &quot;Wells&quot; brand (Mexico) $4 (half what I paid for
the Bosch). I put that in and the van is running
great. Soon as I can I'll get a Bosch backup (Yeah,
I'll also carry the old taped-up condensor).

I've got a warm, fuzzy feeling for this
south-of-the-border condensor that got me home-- i'll
let list know how long it lasts.
