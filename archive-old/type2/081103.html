Subject: RE: [T2]Slider sun roof 

&gt; He said this after
&gt;*I* put grease all over, *I* collected dirt on a dirt road, and
&gt;*I* brought myself to a state where I need to ask this question:

I've been using white Lithium grease for lubrication on my '77 sunroof.
To keep the dirt out and most of the water, I bought some white adhesive
backed weather striping at the local home center. Surprisingly the same
piece has lasted for over a year and at about $14 it's a very cost effective
substitute for the actual VW felty business.

&gt;[2] Where can I find the little, and easy to break, gizmos that
&gt;actually effect the last bit of closing, i.e., which pivot and
&gt;raise the tail end of the roof into position.

 As far as those &quot;little cam type lifters&quot; good luck! I had to rig mine
using JB-weld and some very small hose clamps, they've managed to hold up
for over a year of use, so if you have all the pieces you might give that a
try.

Sunroofs Rock !!!!

Cheers
	-Dave
