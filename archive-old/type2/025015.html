Someone made the comment that no busses came from the factory with front-
mounted spares.  If this is true, why does the front panel of my '78 Westy have 
a custom spot for mounting the tire?  The sheet metal has an indentation that 
matches the tire.....  I've thought about removing the tire to add the chrome 
VW logo, but that big indentation makes it really quite a chore.  And no, it's 
not dented that way......
