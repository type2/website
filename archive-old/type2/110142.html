Subject: Re: [T2] porsche style  cooling fan

&gt; I read an interesting article written by Jake Raby.
&gt; Here is what he has to say on that type of conversion.

Great article. I didn't realize:

&quot;The easiest way to know if your engine suffers from overcooled oil is a milky
white residue that forms in the breather hoses, and under the oil cap, this is
condensation.&quot;

I didn't realize that this was from condensation. I think I need to check my
thermostat, maybe advance my timing a little more...
