Subject: VW mechanics in Nashville

Anyone have a favorite VW mechanic in Nashville?

I friend of mine is &quot;on the road&quot; and needs the oil changed on this 
v*nagon.  Unfortunately, no one seems to have the oil filter for his 
model ('86, IIRC), and I was curious if anyone out there could make a 
suggestion.

cheers
