Subject: Re: Bus vs. Westy

Landon,

A Westy is a &quot;Wesfalia Camper Conversion&quot;.

I think different year Westy's started life as different Bus models. For
instance, my 1969 looks as if it was converted from a sunroof bus, whereas
some later models started life as hardtops.

Westy's also come in &quot;pop-top&quot; and &quot;hard-top&quot; models. The Pop-tops have a
pop-up tent built into a secondary fiberglass top which hinges from the
front or rear, or pop straight up, depending on model year.

As a visual reference, if it has the jalousie side windows (the louvered
ones), it's probably a Westy (in the USA, anyway. In other parts of Mother
Earth, I think the UK Devon model is the most popular camper conversion,
list?).

There you have it.

Landon, obviously befuddled with &quot;the lingo&quot; wonders:

&gt; What is the difference between a bus and a Westy?
