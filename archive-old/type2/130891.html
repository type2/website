Subject: RE: [T2] Cool funky bus...

While I credit the creator of this ummm mongrel for his originality and self 
expression, I guess I prefer the look of simplicity.  He must have a

&gt;I saw this bus on the way home from work... pretty cool!  Has a F*rd
&gt;engine in it.  Check out the Cadillac seats.  Nice skylights!  Wonder
&gt;what that bumper is from?
