Subject: Re: [T2] Murder investigation

what a horrible incident, makes you weary to sleep at
those desolate rest stops, even though ive done it too
many times to count.   hope they catch the bastard(s)
who did it.   anyways the story from the local paper
is here:

&gt; I got a phone call at work this morning from the
&gt; Conway County,
&gt; Arkansas Sherrif's Department asking if I had worked
&gt; on a woman's
&gt; '71 bus on Thursday or Friday. She was found dead in
&gt; a rest area
&gt; on I-40 near Conway. Apparently she was having some
&gt; trouble with
&gt; her bus on a cross country trip and someone she knew
&gt; had given
&gt; her my name from the AIRS list. I didn't get a call
&gt; from her.
&gt; The investigators are looking for any information
&gt; they can get
&gt; on this case. If you know anything at all about a 25
&gt; year old
&gt; woman traveling West on I-40 in a '71 bus with two
&gt; dogs, please
&gt; contact Cleve Keeling at (501) 354-2411.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope this isn't the first notice of this to any of
&gt; her friends.
&gt; I know the family has been notified. My sincere
&gt; condolences to
&gt; family and friends.
