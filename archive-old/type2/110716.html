2 tone sage green and white, very complete.  Needs
battery and tune up.  Engine is good, would like to
get around $750 and don't want to part out.  Has some
rust but not too bad, Has original owners manual, and
maintenance book, both back seat but need new
material.  Was having a wheel problem not sure if it
is bearings  or cv joint.  Would like it to go to a
home where it won't be parted, worth well over that
for parts. Sliding door is rusty but have a
replacement I will include. Please email me at
pflynn_at_arinc_dot_com for interest or questions. No
pictures yet.
