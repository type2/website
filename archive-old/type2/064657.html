Subject: Safare high-roof meets Jackie Chan

Tonight I rented the Jackie Chan movie &quot;Rumble in the Bronx&quot;.  During a
chase scene (well, that's not saying much, the whole movie is a chase
scene) in a parking garage, I noticed a Safare high-roof VW camper parked
in a parking spot.  I think it was in an uncovered part of the garage,
since the high-roof won't fit into any parking garage that I know of.
Anyway, the Safare logo in the front was plainly visible.

Later, there is another VW high-roof camper (the same one, I suspect) that
is the surveillance vehicle used by the NYC police in the movie!  They
didn't show it very much, though.  I never would have thought I would see a
VW camper in a movie like this.  Wish I had one of those fancy digital
cameras or a video capture card so I could pilfer some photos for the web,
but at least I know where I can find it later.
