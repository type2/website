Subject: 911 bus: first drive!

Woohoo!!! It's been 3 years I believe since I bought the engine and it's
been 1 year since I've last driven the bus. Finally, I got it started
today.   It's a small 911 engine, a 1971 2.2 liter with only about 130hp
and 120 ft-lbs of torque, but acceleration is now effortless, like that of
a normal car.

I only drove a short distance because the exhaust is unbearably loud.
There's also a pretty big oil leak. Actually, the project is far from over:
tin needs to be fabricated for the engine bay seal, a custom exhaust must
be made to clear the rear valence (right now I've got the Porsche exhaust
mounted upside down to clear valence and bumper, but it's just a couple of
inches above the ground), in fact, there's a hundred of little things that
need to be done to tidy up the installation, but I've got all winter and
I'm told winters are looong up here...

Sami
