Subject: '78 Shell &amp; '71 Deluxe Available Seattle, WA

Hi All,

It's finally time for some pre-spring cleanup. First to go must be my
'78 Standard. It's a project with lots of bodywork completed and the
only remaining bit is the right rear corner. I will include the
replacement corner. No engine, but otherwise complete. First $100 takes
it, with clean title. This bus is nearly rustfree, with good and
complete interior and currently mostly disassembled, but will roll. New
brakes and cv's on this also.

Second to go will be my trusty '71. If you really want a clean '71 and
can deal with a (not to severe) front hit, I have the replacement panel
and new bumper. Good running 1600 and exceptionally clean body,
otherwise. 

I really want this bus to go to someone who will fix and drive it, so am
very flexible on the price. If you really want a '71, let's talk. Put
the windshield and doors back on and drive this anywhere. Lotsa spare
parts, including transaxle. Clean WA title.

Last to go will be my '67 camper. This is a major project, but do-able.
Let's talk about this one.

That's all the bus content, but I also have a '66 Deluxe Bug and a '63
Bug Ragtop for sale. 

Take all these and I'll give you a HECK of a deal. 

Pmail me.
