Subject: Water Temp Gauge as Oil Temp Gauge?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.GSO.4.10.9903221221470.14651-100000_at_larry_dot_cas.utk_dot_edu&gt;


Wally World (Walmart for the uninitiated) has water temp gauges, complete
with sender, for the LOW LOW price of $10.  And it doesn't even say &quot;Water
Temp&quot; on it, just has a little picture of a thermometer partially immersed
in some sort of liquid substance.  Could be oil, could be water.  Could be
Sangria, I'm not sure. 

Being the cheapskate that I am, paying ~$45-60 for an oil temp gauge gives
me Kennel Cough.  Therefore, I want to know the following:

-Is this possible? (possibly in sump plate or relief valve)

-Anybody ever done it?

-Am I whizzing into the wind?

What I'm really wondering about is clearance if used in the sump plate.
There doesn't seem to be much.

All opinions requested!
