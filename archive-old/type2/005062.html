Hello,

I have read Muir regarding this test, but it is still not clear to me as to
which part of the stick is applied to the test. The obvious answer is the
top. Is this correct? Is there available a dip stick temp gauge for a 72
1700cc camper? Are they accurate? If not, is there a way to add degrees to
the reading to get a reasonable accurate number?What is a safe running
temperature? I cannot access the type2 site at all. Is the library still
available?

Thanks

Rich Patano
