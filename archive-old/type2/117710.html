Richard,

I don't remeber that they were a &quot;kit&quot; as they came separately.

I suspect that it is because this is what they are putting on buses
in Brazil or someplace and the rubber is just made different.

As Chris or someone also pointed out, they are also made from aluminum 
rather than &quot;chrome&quot;.

Other than that, I have no idea....

Cheers, dave

&gt; So the kit comes with both the inside and outside metal trim?
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; They are supposed to end flush with  the vent wing channel.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The outside ones are alos *not* made as the original.

&gt; I've heard this from a few people now via pmail. What's the most likely
&gt; reason for this?
