Subject: Solved Mystery of the Day

Hi All,

SCENARIO: Girlfriend's 77 bus died in transit, luckily close to home.  Would
not start once stopped.  I went and checked it out on the street and after
finding nothing evident to the naked eye, I towed it with my bus (a 79) the
remaining 1/4 mile to her house.  Upon trying again, the starter cranked
strongly but nothing would catch.  I thought it could be a nasty FI or
internal ignition problem.  Yikes.  I felt there was nothing more I could do
at the time.

FIX #1: Given my friend's AAA membership, I resigned to letting her use it
once again and getting it towed to her VW mechanic....she has had to use AAA
a few times recently for various reasons, and this one could
'veunfortunately meant a cancellation situation for her.  (Gee, insurance
providers are so helpful sometimes.)  This bothered me, being another 10+
year holder of AAA &quot;protection&quot; and I still sought another option.  I
decided to try something on a whim.

FIX #2: To make a long story short, I swapped the ignition coil from my 79
into hers. I remembered a cute little game I used to play with my
car-driving friends in high school, whereas I would disconnect their coil
wires and leave them unable to start their cars while I laughed in the
passenger seat; the sound of the engine trying to start without a connected
coil is still very fresh in my memory, and the sound here was similar.  Upon
swapping, her bus started right up.  So, after a trip to the parts house, no
tow and no repair bill and all is well.  It goes to show that sometimes
(most times) the most obvious and simple solution is indeed the one with
these beloved machines.
