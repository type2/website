Subject: wiring schematics for an AUTO trans 79 Westy?

The lights on the floor for the drive selector aren't working, and I cannot
find a schematic anywhere as to how to trace them back. I have a grey wire
with a red stripe hanging by the fuse panel, but am afraid to hook it up to
power in case I fry something. My thought however is that it may be the wire
that is for the lighting on the floor selector (you know, 1,2, D, R, P) :-)
Does anyone have a schematic or could trace theirs? The bulbs seem fine but
no lights at night.
Thanks,
Courtney
