&gt; 1 - Does the thermostat pull the wire when it gets hot or does release the
&gt; wire when it gets hot?

When hot, it expands, the cable moves and the flaps open.

&gt; 1a -  If the wire is not attached and the lever on the flaps is let loose so
&gt; that the spring move the lever - are the flaps open to let are in or closed
&gt; to help warm the engine?

Open to keep the engine from overheating if the spring is properly
connected. The only downside to this is that the engine will be overcooled
at startup and the Hoover advice wrt this is that the cylinder will wear a
little more than normal over their lifetime.
 
&gt; 2 - When should the thermostat move the wire. i.e. It was about 50 degrees F
&gt; today and I started the motor and let it run until is slowed to an idle
&gt; (around 5 minutes)- should the thermostat have moved?

It's stamped on the thermostat. The Type 4 unit says 85-90C (185-194F) which
would have the fully open by then.
 
&gt; 3 - If we determine that the thermostat is no longer working - what should
&gt; my plan of attack be (I understand that the thermostat is NLA)?  Until I can
&gt; find a suitable replacement for the thermostat, should I leave the flaps
&gt; open or close (summer / winter)?

Open, otherwise you risk head and/or piston failure from overheating.
