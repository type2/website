The only  problem with using our buses as weapons of mass destruction is
that the  weight of explosives (diesel fuel &amp; fertilizer, plastique,  C4,
whatever...) would require the objective to be located in a  downhill
trajectory.  This severely limits the viability of the weapon  on many
likely targets.
