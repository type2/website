Today at COSTCO I saw a brand new Eurovan Camper [the side awning housing
even had a &quot;Eurocamper&quot; sticker affixed] that was &quot;decorated&quot; as if it were
a '60s bus.

Had an enormous peace symbol on the rear hatch/liftgate, and bright yellow
and orange flowers all over the sides and front.  I checked.  They were
painted on, not just removable stickers.

Hard to believe that someone would pay the outrageous price for one of these
rigs and then plaster stuff all over it.
