Subject: Westfalia for sale: Portland, OR

Bay window Westfalia for sale in SE Portland (Milwaukie), at a small used car 
lot.

Its an early style westie with the single cot up above and the &quot;mustard&quot; 
colored vinyl upholstery; &quot;jump&quot; seat behind driver seat, sink/icebox behind 
passenger seat.  

I was told it runs well; has a 1600 dual port engine, and one set of brakes 
re-done.

It is red, appears solid but a bit rough around the edges.

He was uncertain of the exact year and was busy with a customer, so I didn't 
get details.

He's asking $1300.

Dealer is Premier Auto Wholesale, owner Larry Jakobson
