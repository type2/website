       Well, obviously you can get away with more compression in a
watercooled engine, but they're saying 9 for the wc VW and 9.5 for the wc
Subaru. So I'd probably go with 8 or 8.5  for an engine like Steve is
talking about. What the hey, if it pings, burn the 89 octane.
       I agree with what George said about staying away from the earlier
Subaru wet-sleeve engine. I had two of those suckers -- major PITA trying to
stop the cyl head water leaks.  Used to call my Subaru  by the name of Ruby
Sue.   8-)
