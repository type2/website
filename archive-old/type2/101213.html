Subject: Re: [T2] Rock tumbler parts cleaning

I tend to stay away from Eastwood, because I feel they gouge where possible.  
I don;t mind someone turning a profit but I found that if they sell 
something, it can generally be found for le$$ somewhere else.  I'm not 
independently wealthy so don't like to spend bux I don;t have.

I have nothing personal against Eastwood, they provide a service to restorers 
that aren't willing to do some leg work.  However, I feel that their prices 
tend to &quot;add value&quot; to &quot;restored&quot; vehicles by creating a false sense of what 
the tools/materials really are worth.  As someone with more love than money 
where it comes to maintaining my beloved buses, that tends to drive up the 
prices of things I need, reducing my ability to do what I need to keep the 
stable going.
