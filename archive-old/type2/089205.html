Subject: Re: [T2] engine lid bracket

[...]


&gt; Does anyone have a ruler they could measure the bracket on the engine lid,
we
&gt; are restoring a 1972 and I put the bracket on it which I thought was from &gt;
when we pulled it apart but the lid on the open psoition hits the rear door
&gt; and on closing the arm hits the engine compartment on its way down, please
&gt; help thanks Dylan

Bracket?  It should be a spring steel piece that looks like a safety pin. It
was the same from 64 to 79. From the bolt end on the lid to the clip holding
it together on the bottom end, it is 10&quot; long. Only difference that changed
over the years were the rollers on the body. Early used 2 metal rollers, late
bay used a nylon block.
Go here, it will be #3.

6 is the early rollers.
