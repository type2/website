Noticed a big drop in the oil pressure at idle when the fuel pump
diaphram started to leak gas into the crankcase on my 1600DP.

&gt;William asks:
&gt;&gt;  Out of interest, is there anyone here who can say they were able 
&gt;to
&gt;prevent
&gt;&gt; damage to a stock engine, through the use of gauges, which would 
&gt;have
&gt;&gt; happened
&gt;&gt; otherwise? ie not &quot;I heard it pinking and noticed the oil pressure 
&gt;was
&gt;low&quot;
&gt;&gt; or &quot;I smelt hot oil and saw the CHT was rising&quot; but &quot;everything 
&gt;was going
&gt;&gt; perfectly and then the oil pressure started to drop. I pulled over 
&gt;and
&gt;&gt; found that my engine was about to explode with no other 
&gt;indication!&quot;.
