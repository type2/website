Subject: 78 westy interior for sale

I have a mostly  complete 78 interior for sale. Does not have the cover 
for the rear deck cushion or
front seats.It is the icebox/sink type interior. I was holding on to 
this for a Canadian brother and he has since found one. I am located in 
Mystic,CT. I really need the space back in the garage. I would like to 
get $150 or best offer.
