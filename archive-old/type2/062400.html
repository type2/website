&gt;Subject: 1968 VW Bus Shifter Problems &gt; snip &gt; &gt;Greetings All: &gt; &gt;I would
like to have suggestions from anyone &gt; &gt;concerning a problem we are having
with 68 &gt; &gt;Bus.  It is very diffcult to find 1st and 2nd &gt; &gt;gear.  When we
can get the transmission in &gt; &gt;1st or 2nd it works fine and shifts into
gear &gt; &gt;with no grind or other noise.  It almost &gt; &gt;appears as a linkage
problem.  The clutch is &gt; &gt;fully disengaged and all other gears are &gt;
&gt;normal. &gt; &gt;Any Suggestions? &gt; &gt;Thanks, Gene Nichols &gt; &gt; Gene, although
I've never encountered this &gt; problem, many have and the usual cure is
said to &gt; lie in the shift guide plate under the lever.  &gt; It's a gate
like template that guides the &gt; movement of the linkage.  It is said that
the &gt; plate frequently comes loose but may become &gt; severely worn.  Your
symptom sounds like it may &gt; be incorrectly positioned.  Do not, however,
over &gt; look the coupler just at the front (FIF) of the &gt; transmission
cover. It must be tight and safety &gt; wired.  &gt; Lessie in Alhambra, CA &gt; &gt;

 Gene, The shifter guide plate is only the first place to check out as I
have found out recently.  A couple of weeks ago I didn't think I was going
to make it to work because of shifting problems. Like not wanting to go
into gear or coming out, and grinding when going into reverse.  First I
tried adjusting the clutch with no luck. With further reading on and off
line and getting a bit greasy it looks like I've got some major work to
do.  The second place to check is the bushings in the linkage.  Mine are
definatly wore out and there is trany fluid ousing out of the seals where
the shifter goes in.  I know I need I need a new clutch, so.....
