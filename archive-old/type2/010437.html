Cross posting out of hope that the right person will see this

On July 17th 1969 Mr. H took his family to Alexander Volkswagen in
Greensboro, NC to buy his family a new car. He drove off the lot with a
brand new 1969 volkwagen Microbus. For thirty years it served he and his
family well. Mr H was very proud of his bus and took great care to maintain
it and keep it garaged so that it would last him a long time. 

In 1989 he retired but decided that the bus would not. He spent a wad of
cash repainting the bus the original color(velvet green with white top) had
the engine rebiult and the brakes done. He even added some new KYB shock. He
continued to use the bus for family and goods transport. But over the next
10 years he only put 9k miles on the bus. By 1998 Mr H and his wife who were
well into their late seventies felt they were getting on in years a little
too much to drive the bus and decided to sell.

In November 1998 I was scanning thru the paper and saw a simple ad that
caught my attention. &quot;1969 vw bus, original owner, call.&quot; So I did. After a
breif conversation with the seller I took my daughter out to look at the
bus. Stella busily filled our '72 bus up with acorns and pinecones from the
sellers yard while I looked over the '69 bus. 

Even when I pulled up in the driveway I was amazed at the shiny straight bus
parked in the there . It looked like a full resto had been done. I looked
over the bus carfully and took it for a test ride. I was dumbfounded because
it drove so well and looked so good I had to by it. Michele the S.O. was out
of town on business and I had to wait till she returned to strike a deal.
After talking it over and having a local shop doulble check behind me we
decided to buy the bus!

When we finally took delivery of it I was amazed as the owner presented me
with 30 years of recipts including the original bill for the bus, some spare
parts and odds and ends.

We loved the bus and took it on a Christams road trip not long after we
bought it and had a great time.

Over the next several months I tended to a few minor mechanical issues with
the bus but overall she was a solid runner and a good looker. I decided to
turn our '72 passenger bus into a camper.

In Sept on 1999 with the &quot;72 bus was sidelined by an ignition switch problem
and  I decieded I would take the '69 bus and the sidetent to Hanging Dog for
the annual campout. 

On the return trip I was rearended on the interstate during one of those
breakcheck rubbernecking deals. The '69 bus was towed the remainder of the
120 miles home. I was skaken by the wreck and stunned by the loss of the
bus. I was happy that no one was hurt and overjoyed to see Michele and the
kids when I got home!

At the begining of October I received a settlement check from the other
parties insurance company. The bus was declared a total loss but I bought it
back on a salvage title. The money I received suprisingly covered my
investment in the bus and a few extra dollars.

The bus still sits in the driveway with the rearend tucked up against the
house so the neighbors dont complain. In fact the tag is still on it and it
is still registered. 

Where do we go from here? I won't let this bus go to the crusher and I am
hesitent to part it out. I have so far resisted pulling pieces off that are
really needed for the '72.

Option #1 Bring it back to where it was.
    The cost of the paintjob alone would wipe me out!
Option#2 Replave damaged metal and parts prime it and drive it as a beater.
    This is feasable but sort of a heartbreaker ( and I am reminded that we
already have a beater:)
Option #3 Sell it to someone in as is condition(sans motor) and make them
swear upon threat of a voodoo curse that they will follow up with option #1
or #2 and nat part the bus out.

Here is what the bus needs.

Left rear corner
rear bumper
LR tail lamp
engine valance
engine lid
Hinge carrier
Cargo hatch( might be able to salvage current one.

I an not sure if the frame was bent in the accident. All systems were in
great running order before the accident. The interior is a complete 7 pass
walkthru with two tone interior gray interior. There was not a spec of rust
in this bus except a pinhole below the windscreen and alittle below the
window on the drivers door. The rest of the bus was straight and shiney
before the wreck.

I am not sure what to ask for this bus but I know I could part it out for a
tidy sum. If you are interested please contact me. Pic may be available soon
on the internet.

The 69 is too young to die!
