Subject: RE: non poptop westy rejected

I also find it hard to believe that this club would reject a non poptop
westy.  These are truly &quot;Westys&quot;.  Even the Volkswagon/Westfalia manual
shows them.  While they are bottom of the line Westfalias (at least in
the later bread loaf years) they are Westys just the same.
