Hi Bob,

The milage fee and the one-way surcharge are a killer at uHaul. And  
don't forget that you have to fuel that gas guzzling pig. They're  
reasonable for a local run but if you're going more than 60 miles per  
day it's gonna hurt.

In other uhaul news: A recent Ontario Gov't audit of uHaul saw over  
50% of their fleet had serious safety issues:
