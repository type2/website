&gt; If you can describe exactly how it &quot;barely runs&quot; then that would help
&gt;the Listpeople out...


Well......keep in mind that I'm not a mechanical chick (yet!), so this won't
be too technical: 

When I test drove it today there was a very clear scraping noise coming from
one of the front wheels. It happens once per reveloution of the tire. I felt
like it was on the driver's side, but the two passengers, who could also
hear it clearly, couldn't tell for sure. The seller said he thought it was a
rock in the wheel well, or something like that. After the initial test
drive, the sellers took it for a ride and came back saying they didn't hear
it anymore. They drove it to our house, and I went out for a short ride a
while later. I didn't hear it then either, until after about 10 minutes on
the road, then there it was again. 

I mentioned braking problems before, but I think I was wrong. There aren't
any braking problems really, it's just that the scraping seems related to
the brakes, and it makes me nervous. Right now the bus brakes fine, but I'm
a little scared to drive it at high speeds or anything. I'm still getting
used to driving a bus again. Ah, how good it feels! :) But I don't trust the
brakes really, just because of the noise, not because they seem to give out
or anything like that. 

Something else non-technical is that it just runs loud and &quot;knocky&quot;. It
doesn't purr and have that delightful VW trademark whistle that my old bug
had when I start it up. It's like the engine has to struggle just to stay
alive. I think this is where the tune-up comes in. 

Tomorrow I'm buying the idiot's guide, and calling a mechanic to see if he
can check it over for me. 

So the problems seem to be:

1. The scraping noise in the front.
2. Terrible fume smells. 
3. The muffler has multiple holes, is rusted, and needs to be replaced.
(Could a beginner do that?) 
4. For sure needs a tune up. 

I checked the Air Cooled FAQ and found out my engine type is:
GD '78-'79       2000     Hydraulic valve lifters

I don't really know what this means, but hopefully I'll have a better idea
tomorrow, and I figure it might be helpful to you guys. 

Also, I found out it's a Westie. I didn't know this until I emailed some
people privately and read some web pages. The PO's said it had a &quot;westfalia
sink&quot; or something, but it wasn't advertised in the paper as one. It was
just called a camper. I was happy to learn that '78 was a good Westy year,
although it probably won't matter considering all the engine work I'm going
to need. :)
