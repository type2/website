Subject: Re: [T2] shifting is stressing me out man ...

Hi Ian,

Check the clutch cable. If the clutch is worn the bus will be hard to 
shift, exactly as you indicate. This is particularly true if you have 
more problems at a standstill than you do when moving. You may need to 
tighten the clutch cable, or you may need a new clutch.

It could also be the rear linkage, the one at the nose cone of the 
tranny.

Happy trails,

&gt; first works.  Getting to a stop sign from thrid, then stopping, then 
&gt; going to neutral then first, is almost impossible.
