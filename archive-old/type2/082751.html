Subject: re:(new valve tick and loss of power)

Mark,
  You might be dead on there. I think you sould be
able to see the Brass looking tops of your guides.
they should all be the same level.
  This sounds exactly like what happen to my type4.
Couldnt find the source of the noise. Adjusted valves
a bunch of times .... checked plug wires  etc etc.
Then it started billowing smoke all at once (guide
dropped all the way out). Shut it down an check the
guides/seat.
  Could be your guide dropped and is being hammered by
the valve. When I took my head off and looked, the
brass alloy guide was no longer straight tube.. it was
flared at the end by the radius of the valve like a
trumpet and a approx. .5&quot; crack had grown along the
length.
  Loss of power was not noticed though untill it
started billowing smoke... Suddenly I might add.


New problem,  I had a sudden brand new, loud valve
tick.  This was literally all of a sudden, driving
down the road.  --------
Anyways, has there been a valve seat become detached
(dropped) all of a sudden?  Am I in for a rebuild?
