Subject: Load stumble

Recently I've noticed Marty has been doing this random &quot;stumble&quot; when under
high load, like floored in fourth. Not constantly, just the occasional
&quot;burp&quot;, like a miss or something. I can feel the bus lurch ('80 T3) I'm
leaving on a couple of trips soon, and I don't like gremlins appearing out
of nowhere without pouncing on them right away. Kind of like spotting one or
two termites...

Ignition system is all new. Recent tune up. All new vacuum lines and fuel
lines and fuel filter. No fuel pump noises. Been running sweet until now.

Nathaniel
