Friends,
Without wishing to open another can of worms before Friday, maybe we should 
all reflect on how it might have come to pass that the campground owner was 
moved to pull a revolver on one of our clan. It brought back to mind an 
incident I had in Washington state where a far off-the-road campsite owner 
was very reluctant to rent to us because no more than 5 minutes earlier he 
had angrily thrown out a VW van load of 'hippies&quot; who had arrived late the 
night before, stayed, and then claimed inability to pay for their site. 
Maybe we need to be aware of the possibility that we are &quot;marked&quot; by some 
business people who come in contact with all the various kinds who are part 
of our clan, and so we get stereotyped unfairly.
Roland -'75 Westy
