&gt; It is my understanding that you can also use a simple T-fitting at the fuel
&gt; outlet on the tank to avoid changing tanks.  I can't imagine why this can't
&gt; be done as long as both fittings are in the unpressurized line between the
&gt; fuel pump and the tank.  It would save a lot of trouble.  Has anybody had
&gt; problems doing it this way?  I recently installed a 79 2.0 FI in a 74 Westy
&gt; using this method.  

I'll admit, I haven't tried it.  But it really doesn't sound like a very good 
idea.

It seems to me that the way you've got it set up you'd be VERY susceptible to 
vapor-lock.  The original system was set up to dump the excess fuel back into 
the tank.  That fuel has just been passed through your (very) hot engine 
compartment.  If you're recirculating that fuel right back through the pump and 
into the lines in the engine compartment it's going to get hotter and hotter.

It also means that you are sending pressurized fuel back into your pump.  I 
don't know if that's a problem or not, but the pumps were designed to pull 
unpressurized fuel, not be force-fed.

But hey, if you've shown that it works with no adverse effects, go for it!
