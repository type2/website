Subject: Re: [T2] New Tool!!!

This thing is so much fun to use, if I have a mini seminar, I'll have one of
the guys shoot some pics and post them.

This did take some time to design and make, but I think I can make some more
and make them affordable.  Heck, the easier and better busses are
maintained, the more of them will stay on the road.

I would have thought VW would have a cool tool for this job, but Bently
shows taking the bearings completely out and packing them, which takes
forever because the bearings are pressed in!!


&gt; Discovery can be an exciting thing! There's a little of the mad scientist in
&gt; any real VW lover.
&gt; Feel free to share! Tell us more! Jan B
