I think that it has something to do with the First Law of Thermodynamics!  Cheers....KR

thing actually works.  Reading between the lines, it appears that the
device uses electricity from the vehicle to perform electrolysis on the
water, yielding hydrogen and oxygen that are conducted to the manifold to
be burned by the engine.

Not a bad idea, but the energy for the electrolysis has to come from
somewhere and the process cannot return more than that amount of energy
when the hydrogen and oxygen are recombined.  The returned energy will
actually be less because no process is 100% efficient.

Now, if they were using a large solar array to run the generator and then
burning the hydrogen the approach might be a way to get &quot;free&quot; energy.
However, using the alternator of the vehicle to supply energy is just
robbing Peter to pay Paul.
