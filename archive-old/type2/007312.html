&gt;if it's really pouring out, chances are it wasn't installed properly. 
consult your favorite manual for exact instructions. make sure there's 
no crud where the oil cooler seals seat, and get all those washers in 
the right place. in all my searching, i've never found an actual torque 
value for tightening those three nuts, so i just wrench away until the 
cooler firmly presses the seals, but not so much that it distorts them. 
don't use *any* sealant on those gaskets!

The official spec for those oil cooler nuts is *5 foot pounds!!*
This is not a lot of torque.  It is basically snug and just a hair 
tighter.  If you really crank on them you can distort the seals and 
cause major leakage. 

Walter is correct in that sealant is not needed, but I find that in 
order to keep the gaskets on the engine while I'm installing the oil 
cooler, I need to use a teeny little dab of Permatex blue oil sealer 
silicone stuff on the engine side OUTSIDE part of each seal to basically 
stick it to the case while I slide the cooler onto the studs.  Don't let 
any get to the inside part of the seal or to where it could block oil 
passages when it hardens.  You don't need much at all to stick the seals 
to the case.
