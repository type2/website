The consensus was Baaaad Boooster!

Well... I just got finished looking at it the *dirty* way,, turns out The
booster was 1/2 full of brake fluid,,, I guess the owner didn't realize that you
shouldn't have to put more brake fluid in than gasoline!

I got soaked in fluid when I went to slide the booster out .  


That means the master cylinder seals are leaking and bypassing fluid,, the
amount of fluid cause a hydraulic lock of some sort

I think that the engine must have been drinking the brake fluid as it was up to
the vac nipple!


Ok, so I put on another booster and master cylinder  ,
