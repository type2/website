&gt;Thinking about buying a book on do-it-yourself bodywork, something to
&gt;ease me into that kind of stuff. (I actually despise bodywork, but it

&gt;recommendations?

  It's been my experience that the best ones are old vocational school text
books usually found cheap at used book stores or flea markets.       PINK
