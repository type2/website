Subject: Re: [T2] steering coupler folks be aware!!!!

Folks,

I have one of these from one of the more popular triple discount
suppliers on the list.  It is sitting in my hand as I write.

It is labeled 211-415-417(made in Mexico).  It is square with metal
bushings where the bolts go thru.  It appears to be made in two parts as
there is the remnant of a seam between the top and bottom.  It has a hole
in the middle about 3/4&quot; in diameter

It is *very* stiff and non-bendable.  My guess is that it does have some
sort of metallic reinforcement in the middle.

It is labeled &quot;LEGAR&quot; in the rubber part.

It appears to me to probably be fairly dependable considering that it will
be stressed the logitudinal direction.

Cheers ,dave

&gt; Volks,

&gt; I was kind of ignoring this thread because i thought it was about pulling
&gt; the pitman arm off the steering box.  I just read a couple tho and it
&gt; turns out to be about the coupler between the steering shaft and the box.
&gt; 
&gt; First, I have replaced more than a couple.  Second, I do not believe you
&gt; can get the real VW bus ones any more, but would be delighted to be proven
&gt; wrong on this!  The original dampers were square and had steel or FG
&gt; reinforcement, as Andy mentioned.  The only replacement I have found is
&gt; the bug damper which is solid rubber and round.  I do not see any
&gt; reinforcement in it, tho there may  be and it is just not exposed.  Third,
&gt; and very important.....
&gt; 
&gt; **************************************************************************
&gt; When you install a new damper make sure you install the bolts thru the top
&gt; and put the nuts on from the bottom!!!!!!!
&gt; **************************************************************************
&gt; 
&gt; You are supposed to use new anti-vibration nuts, and I do recommend that
&gt; but as a &quot;belt and suspenders&quot; measure, putting the bolts thru from the
&gt; top ensures that they don't fall out, even if the nuts fall off.
&gt; 
&gt; The job is a doddle to do without removing the steering box if:
&gt; 
&gt; (a) you jack up the front end of the bus and put it on jack stands; and
&gt; (b) you have a helper to turn the wheel 1/4 turn at a time and to insert
&gt;     the bolts and hold them with a socket while you tighten the nuts.
