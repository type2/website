Subject: DAVE NEEDS HELP!

Hey now,
This is Sunshine writing in a plea for Dave Bennett......he is stuck in
KANSAS of all places and luckily he made it to my place without traveling
further with his bus's problem and being stuck with no VW help in Oklahoma
out in the boonies, who knows.......BUT

The deal is he has a busted oil cooler or just bad seals for it and every
time he accelerates about a pint of oil gushes out of the fan shroud so he's
looking to get some ideas how to fix this.
I have two VW mechanics in radius of me but they aren't open on weekends,
one is a friend of mine from being a repeat customer :O) and he said to have
it towed in and he will take a look at it and such and see if Dave can steal
his hydraulic jack and tools for a while :oP
anyhoooo we are going to try that for him tomorrow, all VW shops close for
the weekends around here, thus the reason Cassidy was stuck in there with
all my stuff ALL WEEKEND LONG, (dang I wanted to make Indigibus but Cassidy
now needs to have a newly treated tank as you all know)

So basically DAVE NEEDS HELP guys, everyone that knows him knows he's a kind
man and is always kynd to others so he could use a helpin' hand.
We are here in Bonner Springs Kansas, Leavenworth County, with access to
Lawrence and KC really easy if need be.

EMAIL me please with suggestions!
