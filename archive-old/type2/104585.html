Subject: Re: [T2] oil pressure and voltage

There is a VDO sender wrench socket made for this job.
It is shaped to fit the sender case, with the odd side for grip.
GLIUY :)

&gt; &gt; How do you tighten it up without removing the engine tin? The nut is at
the
&gt; &gt; bottom.
&gt;
&gt; You can't. This type of VDO sender, installed in this way, has to be
&gt; installed before the left cylinder cover. At least that was my experience.
