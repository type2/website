&gt;Might have been good that you didnt block them off if you have the need for
&gt;heat where you are. The booster fan on my bus doesn't put out alot of
&gt;volume. It seems that most of my hot air comes from the cooling fan while at
&gt;higher RPM's. While driving around town I pretty much freeze. Gotta get that
&gt;BA-6 running this fall!

I was able to get these flaps in without removing the heater box.
I first removed the fan. Not the housing! Just the fan. I also took off 
the little covers over where the heater box meets the housing.
I was then able to get both of them in. You can see the one on the left 
by looking at through where the fan was. It also make retrieval of the 
pin when you drop it easy.
All three time in rolled into the fan housing. I had a whistle when I 
reved my motor up that went away when I put these flaps in. Why I don't 
know??
