Subject: Clutch still rumbles

This is on my '72 with a 2 liter/  As I reported earlier when I push the
clutch in I hear a deep rumble.  Suspected the throw out. -- Replaced it
-- still rumbles.  When the clutch pedal is let about half way out it
stops rumbling.  The noise seems to be coming from the transmission.  In
fact I can feel the tranny vibrate with the noise when the clutch is in

I am stumped.  Any Ideas?

Thanks
David
