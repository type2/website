Subject: Chrome Bumpers

Hey guys,

     I'm trying to decide what to do with the bumpers on my car. They
were painted very haphazardly.. almost as if it was an afterthought to
the actually decent nice paint job my car has. Anyway... I was wondering
if they ever sold the Transporter with CHROME bumpers. I'm not much into
customizing.. I realize my car came with white bumpers from the factory,
but would the bus look completely out of place if I had my bumpers
chromed?

Thanks,

Todd
