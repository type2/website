Subject: Re: &lt;F&gt; Beetle Buggin PC game

&gt; From: &quot;Jen&quot; &lt;jen_at_munn_dot_com&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Found this neat racing game in the store called Beetle Buggin for the PC.
&gt; You race various beetles and also busses. Looks like only the early busses
&gt; though from looking at the box.  :-/ Looked neat and I ordered it online.
&gt; Haven't gotten it yet. Their website is http://www.beetlebuggin_dot_com in case
&gt; you wanna check it out.

Must've just come out - my wife showed me the same game last nite at
Target (for upscale shoppers, pronounce it &quot;Tar-ZHAY&quot;) and despite the
fact that it won't run on my 100MHz Pentium I plunked down $19.95 for it
anyway.  I was able to install it (cool interface, looks like fun) but
my PC just can't keep up with it.

The interface reminds me a little of the Star Wars Pod Racer game.  Done
with VW cooperation by some Brit folks, I think.  The car renderings are
pretty faithful.  I like the Monster Singlecab.

Gonna take it over to my brother's house and try it on his 500MHz
machine.  Can't wait to do the nighttime dune buggy race.
