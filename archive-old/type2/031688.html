&gt; sounds like #1 or #2. This engine has just over 1000 miles on it since AVP
&gt; built the long block. (Came with the bus; purchased by the PO) It has
&gt; hydraulic lifters, which is a first for me in a VW. I let it run for a few
&gt; minutes to see if it would quiet down but no luck. Once it's cooled off I'm
&gt; going to check the valve adjustment to see if it's just a loosened adjusting
&gt; screw. (hope, hope!)

valve adjustment on a hydralic lifter is very different than on a
solid...read the instructions
&gt; 
&gt; Question is: A) Can I replace the bad lifter without removing the engine?

yes, but I doubt it is bad, but to pull the old one out just
1. remove that rocker arm
2. slide out the pushrod
2A I find it easier to remove the pushrod tube
3. run a magnet on a stick (parts retriever) into the hole and it will
lift the lifter out

&gt; and B) Can I replace the hydraulic lifters with solid lifters without
&gt; replacing the cam shaft? I assume I'd need the solid lifters and the correct
&gt; push rods and a set of push rod seals. Can it be done, or would I have to
&gt; split the case?

I would stick with the hydraulics...
