&gt; be a great place for a VW gathering so I hope everyone emails me!!!  Also - 

Yes it would be a great place to have a get together.  Especially before
all the tourists set in!  That stretch of coast on DelMarVa has got to be
the prettiest I've ever seen.  Especially up at Deleware State Beach.
Where would you be camping the buses at?

Alas, MD is too far to drive from Arkansas with an un-road-tripped bus...
I'm gonna give her a breakin trip in May driving to Ohio for Buses &amp;
Boats. (for those of you who missed it last month, here's the web site for
more info on that http://www.geocities_dot_com/buses_n_boats/

I hope it works out cuz my wife would LOVE to make it back to the Eastern
Shore.  Hope it becomes an annual thing.
