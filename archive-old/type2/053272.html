Subject: Re: LCD TV (flat screen for a bus)

Phillip &amp; List,

Since this is a bus list, I'll keep my reply shorter than I would otherwise.

Even if you were overflowing with cash, I would think twice before dropping the bucks on an item that
has built in obsolescence and will not work in a few years.  The FCC has mandated a switch over to DTV
in 2002 with lights out for current analog TV in 2006.  This means NO MORE portable TVs.  All of us
with portable TVs for our busses will be left in the dark.  Now if you carry a satellite receiver, it
will still work.  In order for existing analog TVs to work, you will have to purchase a set top
converter ($600+) plus have a REAL good outside antenna.  DTV will not work with rabbit ears unless
you are in direct view of a DTV transmitter.
Check out
http://www.fcc_dot_gov/Bureaus/Engineering_Technology/Factsheets/dtv9811.html
That is a 11/98 DTV fact sheet and it has not been changed or updated since.

That's all I'll write for now, this has limited bus content, I would just hate to see fellow bus
people spending hard earned bus money on a product of limit usefulness and lifetime.  Let's not break
out a DTV thread on the bus list.  P-mail me all you want.

&gt; Hello List.
&gt;   I was browsing on the web the other day and found a cool LCD TV that
&gt; mounts on the ceiling and flips down.  It is made by Audiovox (check out
&gt;
&gt; this site)

&gt;
&gt; I know some of you don't feel a need for a TV but I think they come in
&gt; handy on long road trips.  I called a local car audio store and found
&gt; out that they sell for right around $1000!  Kind of expensive but maybe
&gt; they will come down in a few years. Has anyone came across one that is
&gt; more reasonable?    I have been looking for a lcd TV for a while.
&gt; because it would be perfect for a bus since they are so thin and would
&gt; not take up much space.  Anyone out there have one yet?
