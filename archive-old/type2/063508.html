Subject: Help Cleaning Fiberglass Poptop

I am sure those of you out there in VW land have tackled the problem
of a nasty, grimy, mildewy, moss-covered poptop before.  I just spent
2 hours up there on mine (I'm glad I'm in Georgia where it ain't cold yet)
scrubbing with ENTNT (degreaser/cleaner) and bathroom foam spray.
I KNOW that I shouldn't go about sloshing bleach up there, but at this
point I am tempted to.

Give me some pointers, those of you who have been (up) there, and
tell me if I should paint, scrub some more, or get out the Clorox.

Thanks!
