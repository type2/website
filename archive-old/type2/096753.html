Subject: Re: [T2] 1970 wiper questions

Hiya My,

The hose which is connected to the cap on top of your reservoir is the 
pressurization hose.  On the opposite end of that hose you should find a 
steel fitting inside which is a regular valve core (the same kind you would 
find inside the valve stem on your tubeless tires).  You use this end to 
connect to an air delivery outlet (like you'd find at a service station) and 
pressurize the system to 42 lbs.

Had your wipers worked before you went &quot;fiddling around&quot; my guess is that you 
probably did loosen a wiper contact - probably at the switch.  The wire 
contacts are very close to the washer hose at that point.  Grab your Bentley 
(you do have a Bentley, don't you?  Don't you?  Good God, Man!  You HAVE to 
have a Bentley!) and check the connections against the wiring diagram.

Your Bentley also will have a section in remedying weird wiper patterns on 
the windshield.
