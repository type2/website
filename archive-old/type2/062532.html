Subject: Cylinder to Head Sealing Rings

I have an emergency repair in progress and have some questions.  First the 
questions, then some background.

If my old heads have sealing rings on the cylinder shoulders, should I 
blankly assume that I need sealing rings on new heads, or is there some 
way of knowing whether I need them or not?

Is there anything I should watch out for when I am only replacing the heads 
on an engine with about 35,000 miles on it?

If one of the head studs comes unthreaded from the case, can I just put some 
Loktite on it and thread it back in?

This is a 1600 single port in a 1964 Westy.  I plan on building a 
replacement engine over the next couple of months, but need to keep the 
bus on the road in the meantime.

On the way home on Saturday night, everything was going fine when on the 
next hill, I couldn't keep it in fourth, and in fact slowed all the way to 30 
MPH, something that never happens on this particular road.  There were 
no unusual noises or any other overt indications of what might have caused 
this sudden loss of power, so I just limped on home and used our other car 
the rest of the weekend.  Today, I adjusted the valves and everything 
checked out, with only #2 intake being a little tight.  Then I started the 
engine to warm it up and checked dwell and timing in the meantime, which 
were also alright.  Once the engine was warm, I pulled the plugs 
(platinums) and inspected them and found all plugs a little sooty (too 
rich?) except #4 had what looked like fuel additive deposits completely 
closing the gap.  I then checked compression and found zero on #4.  
Additionally, I could hear a whoosing into the exhaust when checking #4 
that wasn't there when checking the others.  This indicated that I had 
probably burned #4 exhaust valve.  Since I need to have this bus to use 
once or twice a week, I decided to go down to Volks Cafe and pick up a couple 
heads and replace them.  Got the whole thing taken apart and I am ready to 
install the new heads, but thought I'd review my Haynes real quick to make 
sure that I haven't missed anything and they mention sealing rings for 
1961-1965 and 1972-on.  I checked and sure enough, the old heads had 
this sealing ring in them.

Thanks for any assistance,
