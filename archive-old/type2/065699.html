Subject: L numbers &amp; M numbers for toy bus :)

        Clara, someone, 
        I'm serious :) about wanting to know the L and M numbers for
the Franklin Mint toy '62 my wife gave me- But I'm not obsessive and
I can stop any time, really. :)
        Its 
grey-white over salmon;
23 window w/ sunroof (white cloth);
Left hand drive;
White wheels, chrome hubcaps, black-wall tires;
Chrome trim along the style-line below the windows;
Chrome trim along the bottom edge of the sides
Chrome VW emblem on front.
Chrome trim and rubber guards on the bumpers (grey-white);
Only one exterior rear-view-mirror;
Small 'bullet' turn signals in front, amber color;
No back-up lights;
Amber + red rear lenses (european style?)
jail-bars w/ an extra (?) jail-bar on the back of the back seat;
two-tone grey interior;
white steering wheel, gear-shift and parking brake lever;
Gas heater on the left side (FIF) of the engine compartment;
No radio antenna
Chrome on the engine compartment lovures
No handle for the engine compartment- must be 'church key' style
German/English style license-plate frame fore and aft.
Fuzzy grey carpet on cargo compartment above engine. Black floor otherwise.

        I also have a couple-a scale-modeling color questions: 
As built, this toy has 
the heater and heater exhaust a silver color,
a black coil, 
silver carb-to-air-cleaner connection,
copper-colored exhaust,
Underbody all glossy black, including the pedal works cover.
Swing-axles silver

And I think the engine compartment has a black front wall (divider between
engine and gas tank)

        About the heater I'm clueless, but shouldn't 
the coil be blue?
carb-to-aircleaner hose black rubber?
Exhaust light grey?
engine compartment walls and rear-apron salmon pink (This is why I need the L#!)
OR grey-white?

        Thanks all!
        Bill
