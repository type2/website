&gt; &gt; Well, boat folks have tanks in all sorts of sizes and shapes.  Check out:
&gt; &gt; Click on Engine Systems and then Fuel Tanks.  It will yield dozens of
&gt; &gt; different plastic tanks, one of which might fit the tank space of a bus.
&gt;
&gt; yeah I have been playing with their tanks with the idea of putting in a
&gt; larger sized tank, there is quite a bit of space in that recess that is
&gt; extra.  but I suspect that space is for safety reasons and the hassles of
&gt; putting in a guage and the fill tube etc etc sort of pushed this to the
&gt; back burner......

There may be some intrusion space, but IMO the poly tank will be safer
than the metal tank even if it is bigger.  Poly will take a lot more abuse
before leaking than any metal tank.  I've seen 6 gallon poly gas
containers fall off of dune buggy trailers and go tumbling off into the
bushes at highway speeds without significant damage.

The filler would require some engineeering and fabrication, but the
hardware is available.  I'd start with a metal VW filler and adapt it to
the marine inlet hose as soon as possible, as the marine fittings are
more versatile than the VW parts.  Don't forget a good vent to the filler
if you have a late bay with the longer filler pipe.  Otherwise the tank is
a bear to fill.
