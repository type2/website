Could someone please tell me how to do a front end alignment on my 77 bus? I
can't afford a muir manual right now and one of my tires is about to burst
because i have to much toe in. I'm traveling from wisconsin to colorado next
week and could really use the info.

also, my oil sensor snapped off, is it ok to use an easy out to get it out?

Thank You!
Eric
