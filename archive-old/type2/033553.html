&gt;higher altitude=less oxygen per liter of air.  So i thought, when one 
&gt;goes to high altitude you need to _lean_ out the mixture as the 
&gt;higher you go the ammount of fuel metered stays constant, but the 
&gt;oxygen content decreases as you ascend.  then, logically, one 
&gt;would need to lean out the carb to match the changed oxygen 
&gt;content of the air.  
&gt;
&gt;less air+same ammount of gas=too rich???
&gt;
&gt;let me know if i am wrong because i have advised a friend to lean out 
&gt;his carb if he runs bad at high altitude and i want to give him the 
&gt;straight scoop if i goofed.

I think you're saying the right thing, but in order to &quot;lean out the carb&quot;
your friend is going to need a bigger air correction jet.  The mixture screw
on carbs is usually just for the idle circuit.  So unless he's willing to
swap out air jets on the side of the road, he's probably stuck with what
he's got.
