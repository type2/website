Subject: Early/late brake swap question

Volks,

Say for some reason you owned a '71 or '72 that was already in need of a
fairly total front brake overhaul (calipers,rotors, flex lines)  How far
into the system do you have to go to install the later parts?
Are the spindles/steering knucle the same?
Are the hubs the same?
Or can you just install the later rotors and calipers?
All my buses have been '73-&gt; so I have never had to deal with this, but am
curious.

                           Steve Dolan
