Marvel Mistery Oil and Kroil both worked fine for me. I used MM on a '59
Opel engine that had not been turned over in 20 years. I allowed it to
soak for a couple of weeks and then started turning the engine with a
pry bar on the flywheel. Back and forth for a couple of degrees more
each time until I could turn it all the way. This car is now a daily
driver without even pulling the head (I have yet to see the cylinder
walls ...), but it runs strong and only one cylinder fouls the spark
plug a bit more than the others (possibly some damage to the oil ring
there).

I used Kroil in a similar procedure last year to free up a '60 Opel
engine that had not been turned over since '69. It is free now but it is
not running yet due to some other issues.

&lt;&lt; Soak the cylinders with light oil like 3in1 oil. Other options would
be 
ANY oil you have diluted with a bit of mineral spirits to thin it. 

Took me several days but I freed my Corvair engine this way. Each day I
would 
try to rotate it a little eack way and after  acouple days, it broken
loose 
and after 1 more it would rotate. In it runs good these days.
