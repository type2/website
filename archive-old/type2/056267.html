Hi List,

I have a Haynes Beetle &amp; Karmann Ghia 1954-1979 manual that I'm looking
to trade for the Haynes or Bentley manuals for 1975 westy.

Also for the list, where would I find a manual/diagram etc. that shows
how to fill water tank for sink, etc? Obviously I'm in the beginning
stages of my new bus life...

Anyone interested in manual, please pmail

Thanks!
