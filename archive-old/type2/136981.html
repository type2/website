Subject: [T2] CHT Temps

What,s all the fuss?

Look on your VDO CHT temp gauge.  It is not marked in increments of one 
degree or even 10 degrees.  IIRC, it is marked in increments of 50 
degrees.  The best I can do WRT accuracy is +/- 25 degrees (maybe a 
little less).  I'll perform the mental gymnastics (thermocouple 
compensation) if I'm a little bored, but for the life of me, I think 
I'd much rather enjoy the scenery.  Life's too short to stress over 
precision in that fashion.
