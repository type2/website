Finally that popcorn crackle sound has turned into time for a new muffler.
I was interested to find out if most listers do their own muffler
replacement or take it to a specialist.  Would it be worth my time to
purchase a quality muffler and have a proffessional install it? I will
greatly appreciate any help given.
