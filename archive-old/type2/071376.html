by &quot;level of gas&quot; i mean octane rating....volkswagen specified 91.....if your
engine &quot;pings&quot; or has a soft knocking sound when pulling up a hill you have
too low octane or you just need to back ( retard) the timing to compensate.
regular valve adjustments are at either 3000 miles or 6000 miles.....never
over that........the manuals say 6000 miles for a bus.....i do mine more
often.  but it must be done. 


you should buy a john muir vw book &quot; how to keep your volkswagen alive for the
compleat idiot&quot;...it is a great beginner book.  why not drop and extra $50 and
get compu fire or pertonix ignition system this way you wont be changing
points ever again...and your timing will never be
&quot;off&quot;.................something to think about.
