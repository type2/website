Subject: replacing fuel lines, etc.

so sorry to hear about pat's family bus, it really brought home the 
urgency to replace the lines i have been needing to.

a short while back i had the very small piece of hose that connects the 
expansion tubes, to the left of the engine, up in the air vent space that 
you can't see. the only way i could find it was when it finally sprung to 
a point where it leaked well, it was easy to fix and i refused to drive 
until it was replaced. now when i get my gas tank filled, we get fumes 
again, and a tiny puddle under the right side of the bus, as though the 
gas attendant spilled (we're helpless in oregon you know)...

so i pulled the round access hole in the engine compartment to try to get 
at the leak, i think it is the tube that connects the fill spout and the 
tank, but it is a bear to get at. please tell me if you think this is not 
going to work, or if you know it will, when i get home tonight i am going 
to try and take the plate that hides the gas tank off, with out pulling 
the engine mind you, to try to get enough arm back in there to take that 
hose off and replace it, plus, hiding back there is another tiny piece of 
hose on the expansion tube, that isn't going to be easy to replace.

if you ever have your engine out, please go through all your fuel lines 
THEN, when it is much more accessable, and check your tank while your at 
it. i am going to pull my engine sometime in the next year i think, but 
not now, it's far too soon, unless i can't replace any of these lines any 
other way...

also if you wouldn't mind checking out the pics at this link

i have 2 pics from above the  carbs, i noticed these things sticking out 
beside my manifolds and was wondering if anyone can verify that my bus was 
converted from fi to carbs. the second pic vaguely shows that there may be 
a screw(?) in the place of just this one, the other three (thingies) are 
there on the other cylandars.

thanks in advance,
