Subject: Double Jointed Rear axles??

Hello List People!

I am getting ready to do my first engine pull ever on my 71 Type II. I am
using the Muir book as a guide, and the book says give some information on
how to support the transmisson if you have double jointed rear axles. I can
see from the book that the double jointed rear axles were introduced in 68.
Does the 71 have them too?

thanks!
