Subject: Heb/Karmann Picture registry

A freind of mine mentioned to me that I would fun to create a photo
library 
of all the remaining Hebmüllers and early Karmann convertibles. I think
it was
a great idea.
If you know anybody who owns one of these rare cars, please
tell them about the two pages I have created on my homepage ( The Heb
Picture Registry and The Karmann
Picture Registry) 
If you have a picture of a Hebmüller/early Karmann and know of either
its chassis # and/or
body #, please send it to me. I will scan it, and return it safely to
you.
