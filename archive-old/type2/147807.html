&gt;I got the tank out on my 81 Vanagon and am waiting to have it cleaned.  Question - I see in the books the fuel filter is supposed to come before the fuel pump.  However, the prior owner switched them in my vehicle - the pump is before the filter.  Should I change them?

If you've got a plastic filter after the pump that's a definate no-no -- most plastic-bodied fuel filters can't handle the pressure of an EFI system for very long.  On the other hand, if it's got a metal body you're probably fine as-is, aside from the issue of unfiltered fuel potentially shortening the life of your pump.  Gripping hand is, the engineers at VW had a reason for putting things where &amp; how they did, and putting things back to the way they're supposed to be can't possibly hurt anything.
