&gt;I read somewhere (know idea where, it was a while ago) that diesel is often
&gt;used to clean out reg. unleaded engines. where you would fill it up and just
&gt;let the diesel run through and once you get past all the white smoke and
&gt;bucking youd have a cleaner engine. Im not sure of the validity of that, but
&gt;it shouldnt kill your engine, just anoy the hell outta you.

     I think Sir Hoover covered this in a sermon. Gist of it was that it 
worked good for iron (? think it was iron) valves, but was no longer much 
good on a modern valve materials.


Peace,
