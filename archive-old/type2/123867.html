Subject: Re: [T2] Mixture and CDI

Now, what is then the TZH ignition used on Vanagons (and 79 Cali?)? The
system with a hall sensor, DLS, and ignition module. It has warnings all
over not to work on the system with the ignition on because it would produce
higher voltage than conventional systems. Is this CDI as well or something
else?
