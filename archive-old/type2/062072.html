Subject: CA Smog Check II: RIght WIng Hot Air

        For those who have seen/heard the right-wing KGO radio anti-
Smog Check II stuff, here's the *actual* state limits &amp; the study data 
from surveys of actual cars on the road that support the new limit.

        Average of actual vehicles      Smog Check II standard
        &lt;1100 rpm       &gt;2500 rpm       &lt;1100 rpm       &gt; 2500 rpm
Year    HC ppm  CO %    HC      CO      HC      CO      HC      CO
66-67   212     2.3     182     1.7     700     5.5     600     4.5
68-70   192     2.3     163     1.7     650     5.5     600     4.5
71-74   147     1.8     123     1.4     550     5.0     400     4.0
75-80   60      0.3     52      0.5     220     2.0     180     1.7
81-83   42      0.1     37      0.2     120     1.5     150     1.5
84-86   37      0.1     31      0.2     120     1.0     150     1.2
87-92   29      0.1     20      0.1     120     1.0     140     1.0
93+     17      0.0     12      0.1     100     1.0     130     1.0

        I got these numbers from the Consumer Information Center
in Sacramento. 1-800-952-5210  I'm not sure if the 2500rpm numbers 
are on the chassis dyno or just reving up with the transmission in neutral. 
 
        You can see where catalytic converters were introduced in 
mid-70s, and then lambda systems (Oxygen sensors) in the mid-eighties,
in the actual data. 

        &quot;Gross Polluter&quot; levels are another 250-150 ppm HC and
2.5-1.5% CO, larger value for earlier cars, lower value for newer
cars. 

        Contrary to reports that cars older than 4 years are targeted
in these numbers, you can planly see that the actual performance of
the average car 10 years old is good enough to pass the 1993+ standard.
In fact, an average car with a catalyst, all the way pack to 1975, will
pass the current car spec. My '70s actual numbers were

        1051 rpm        2602 rpm
        HC      CO      HC      CO
        195ppm  4.82%   26ppm   0.17%

at last inspection- a bit high for CO at idle, in good shape otherwise. 
My '71 914 (1.7 DJet) used to be the same- high CO at idle. But always
passing. New limits for my single cab are 50ppm tighter for HC and .5%
tighter for CO under the new system.

&quot;Hot Talk&quot; is more like Hot Air, imho. Or maybe they find math too hard.
