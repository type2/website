Subject: Bus Tow Bar?

Afternoon all,

I was wondering if anyone in the Washington DC area might have a bus tow 
bar I can borrow this/next weekend. I am going to pick up a non-running 
bus in VA Beach, and my truck is broke. I'm concerned that my 97 Volvo 
wagon might not be able to handle a bus on a tow dolly.  I am willing to 
compensate you for your time and inconvience.

Let me know,

Thanks,

Martin Green
