Darn, EB02 was gonna relocate to Walmart so we could all camp for

&gt;I have heard Wally Mart allows camping in some of their parking lots

&gt;On our way to Everybus this year, Wal Mart security freaked out when 
&gt;our caravan of 11 buses rolled into their parking lot! One of our 
&gt;group overheard security being told to order us off their property! 
&gt;When we informed them we were there as customers they lightened up, 
&gt;but I sure wouldn't try to spend the night in one of their parking 
&gt;lots-although I do see a lot of big motor homes in the lot of the 
&gt;one in town.
