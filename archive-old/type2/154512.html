Subject: Re: [T2] Speeding ticket in 75 bus........South Caroninian
  advice

I'd be pretty reluctant to make any admissions in the land of mandatory 
minimum sentences .. sure it might be refreshing for a judge to hear: &quot;yeah, 
I did it, I'm sorry, and I won't do it again&quot; but if there is a mandatory 
minimum sentence .. no matter how refreshed the judge may be he may lack the 
discretion to do what he thinks is right ...

I think I would 1) get the best lawyer I could afford .. or 2) I'd look 
around for one of those organizations that strictly defends driving and 
ticket offences - in Ontario we have Points .. but there are these guys:

&gt; I'm not from the South, but... I have been caught speeding a couple of 
&gt; times.
&gt; Usually I can get away with a lesser charge. Most officers do! So I am 
&gt; surprised.
&gt;
&gt; As for court, my court experience is simple. 1) Admit you are wrong and 
&gt; the judge will probably sigh in relief. Can you imagine how much BS comes 
&gt; across their ears.
