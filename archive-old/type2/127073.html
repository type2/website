&quot;Terry, And your point is that professional shops
don't use it? Last time I checked nobody ever thought
the likes of Maaco, Earl Shieb etc, are &quot;professional&quot;
shops... &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;

May be wrong but I think he said professional shops
and
Maaco, Earl Shieb etc in two seperate sentences. Terry
may be a little crazy from living in the windy City
but
I'm pretty sure he knows the dif tween the two
mentioned
above.... does the wind talk to you Terry? hhhmm? :-)
