Yeah, here's a thought.  Pull the engine.  :)

Trust me, you do NOT want to replace the rings with the engine installed.
It is do-able (if you're a maniac) but rings are fragile and the chances of
getting the job done without breaking a ring or getting dirt into somewhere
it shouldn't be are astronomically small.  Bad kharma.  Bite the bullet and
pull that pup.  You're asking - no, BEGGING for trouble if you don't.
