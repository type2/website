Subject: RE: [T2] Rw: Windshield

I talked to them once about it and I cannot remember what panels they had.
It may be worth a call to Ron to see what he has and what he may be able to
get. Maybe a little less in shipping, I don't know. I have heard good things
about these panels in the past, but I have not used them myself. I will be
using one this spring if the rest of the bus fixing goes okay.

I think Bus Depot only has the inner panels and not the under-seal pieces.
Only Schofield carries these that I know of.
