Subject: RE: [T2] Why can't people fix things right?

&gt; I have come to accept that any used VW is screwed up in its=20
&gt; own perverse way
&gt; due to the PO being a moron, cheapskate, or trying &quot;improve&quot; on VWs
&gt; engineering.

My dad's girlfriend's daughter &quot;PJ&quot; is a junk collector of sorts, every
month is seems like her yard has a new addition, whether it be a boat,
motorcyle, golf cart, another boat, a racing go-cart, pop-up camper, and =
the
list goes on.  Last summer she aquired a 69 type I that according to her
&quot;needs work.&quot;  Knowing that I was soon going to be getting a 69 myself =
that
needs an engine, I started inquiring about hers.  So I went over 1 day =
and
took a good look at it and decided that possibly the only thing I may =
want
was the engine, she could keep the car.  The floor pan must have rotted
completly out because the PO had fiberglassed the entire floor, heater
channels and all.  There were no seat rails, and through one of her =
trades,
PJ had some seats from a honda or something that she planned to mount.  =
I
asked her how she was going to do that and she just said &quot;easy, bolt 'em =
to
the floor.&quot;  I tried to convince her that what she had was a death-trap =
but
she insisted she would &quot;get it right.&quot;   If you know PJ you also know =
she'll
never get around to messing with that VW, so hopefully soon I can score =
the
engine (and the pristine front fenders that are currently inside the =
car)
before she mutilates it or trades it away.

&gt;=20
&gt; at all and cobble together &quot;fixes&quot; to problems with whatever is in the
&gt; garage.  These lovely people tend to F up the wiring in cars,=20

I learned this the hard way on my first VW, a 73 type I when the wire I =
ran
from the wiring harness in the front to the license plate light shorted
out against the body and melted every wire it was touching and almost
caught the whole car on fire (that's when I went and got my first =
Bentley.)

&gt; It is too
&gt; painful to see some of the mutilation to the vehicles!=20

My wife gets a good laugh at me whenever they destroy a perfectly
good/restorable type I on Junkyard Wars, because it puts me
in a foul mood.
