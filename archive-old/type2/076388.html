Subject: Re: [T2] Yet another fuel hose question, for '74 Campmobile

&gt;Most of the fuel lines are dry &amp; solid down to what I THOUGHT was the fuel
&gt;pump, on the front of the engine bulkhead, with one old &amp; dodgy looking
&gt;hose, which appears to be leaking, going up &amp; I presume into the engine bay.
&gt;Bentley's says the fuel pump is at the front right of the engine, which
&gt;SOUNDS like it should be in the engine bay, itself. Is the fuel pump what I
&gt;believe it to be (on the front of the engine bulkhead), or is it in the
&gt;engine bay itself?

It is on the bottom of the engine (right front) below tin level, which 
means (to me at least) that it is not &quot;in the engine bay&quot;, but neither is 
it attached to the bulkhead.  It should have three hoses coming out of it 
(one is a small drain hose).


&gt;Also, to replace the fuel hose from the pump (if I'm correct) up &amp; into the
&gt;engine bay, are there any tricks to allow ordinary mortals to do it with the
&gt;engine intact, or do you have to be a contortionist, or remove some engine
&gt;parts to get in to replace the hose &amp; hose clips?

It shouldn't be very difficult at all.  Simply disconnect the hose at both 
ends and pull it through the front tin piece.  It goes through near where 
the tin meets the engine case on the right side (at least in US spec 
'74's).  There should be a grommet in the tin to protect the fuel line.
