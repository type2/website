George,

     Well, since I already bought the new ones I guess I have my spares if
the other side ever fails on the road.  The big thing that scared me was
that on the inner splined race, there was actually metal that had been
galled &amp; moved by the movement of the balls.  The wear in the outer part was
such that you could feel it but I am not sure if it had penetrated the
hardening.  Thanks.
