Subject: Oil selection
Message-Id: &lt;4.1.19990525082810.00957170_at_texas_dot_net&gt;

Karl in Fresno asked me about my selection of 20W50 oil as my oil of
choice for my 1600 SP in my '70 bus.

My response, which I now present to the masses, was: 

Many years ago, I looked at the SAE temp ranges for oil, and decided to
use only straight 40 in all of my cars. I used straight 40 in my Buicks
and Oldsmobiles for many years, as well as in my '69 VW bus.......... all
to very good success and to the desired results of minimal car maintenance
costs.

I would even have to always insist on straight 40 with the mechanic on
those rare occasions when I went to some of the oil change houses, as they
would always want to put multi-grade oils in the cars.

It was not until recently that I switched over to multi-grades for
everything, and I did that with the thinking that, perhaps those temp
range values may have been based upon older operating parameters where
cars were not loaded down with A/C, power this and that, etc.

Also, I wasn't exactly sure what to think about using a single grade oil,
given that the multi-grades must have been &quot;invented&quot; for a reason;
perhaps a reason not properly defined in the SAE temperature range charts.

I now use 10W40 in my road hog cars, and 20W50 in my busses, despite what
the SAE temp range values indicate for single grade oils as being proper
for environment selection.

Frankly, I just don't really know what I should be using for oil
selection. Given that, perhaps my salvation is that I have always tried to
change my oils every 2,000 miles, no matter what I drive. Sometimes, as in
a long trip, I may not make the oil change until around 3,000 miles, but
that is the far outside edge of comfort to me.

Again, I'm pretty much in the dark as to having any singular definitive
reason for my having changed away from single grade SAE 40 to the multis.
I like to &quot;think&quot; that I notice a  change in the appearance of the oil at
change time, for the better, but I also tend to think that this is pretty
much all in my head as an &quot;I wanna see a difference&quot; type thing.

Perhaps my frequent oil change cycles goes a long way in allowing me error
in the final selection of what is really best.

Comments; I'd welcome them.....I really would.

Perhaps a definitive web page exists out there some place.
