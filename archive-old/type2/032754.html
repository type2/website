All you really need to do is find the last owner that the
DMV knows about. Or any one after the one that the DMV
knows about. Just give the DMV a reasonable account of the
ownership trail. Leave out things they do not need to know.
It's going to cost you a transfer fee for each owner.

BTW, if you have AAA, the DMV work can be done at a AAA office.
Beware, though, that the AAA will err on the high side when
computing fees. At the real DMV, you might get someone who
gives you a break.

Hello Fellow List People,
Question: In the past month I've acquired (With &quot;Bill of Sale&quot;) two
different
air-pumping VWs.
Problem: Local Calif. DMV gentleman always seems to be quite full of static,
in that he usually demands in a subtle way (With the DMV &quot;G*d like manner )
in that he wants a complete paper trail of previous owners. Impossible to
say
the ...
One is a 58 and the other a 54 or so (Haven't checked the Vin. as yet.)
How have the rest who have had to deal with sort of &quot;Red tape&quot; type attitude
been able to be successful?
Regard's,
               BOB &amp; MARTHA
