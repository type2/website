Subject: Testing the springs for Thrasher

 This is an add-on to the saga of &quot;weekly bitch&quot;.

 With the help of my &quot;new machine supply house friend&quot;, we jury
rigged an arbor press with a set weight for 120 lb at 1.22&quot; (31.0mm)

 117-126 are the numbers I've read. 

 I had 2-1/2 sets , 20 springs and I'm just looking for maybe close.

 Zip - - -  maybe 3 out of the whole lot.

 What I'm going to look for is one of those little &quot;Porta-power&quot;
pistons and put a guage on it full of oil. 
 Then I can just test in a vise.

 So having a &quot;quadle&quot; of valve springs , ( a quadle is five cards and
none of the same suit) I headed the thirty miles to the FLAPS.

 I had to get valves anyway since that had all been trash.

 I have the guy get out a set of new &quot;stock&quot; springs.

 He sets them up on the counter and I laughed.

 Two of the six are a 1/2&quot; shorter than the others and none of them 
were cut square so they kind of pointed all different directions at
the roof. He said it was his last 8 and I laughed some more.
 Made rude comments.

 If I don't shape up I'm going to lose my discount. He didn't think 
it was funny at all.

 These are &quot;brand new&quot;. I wouldn't use them in a &quot;Soap box racer&quot;!

 I ended up getting the &quot;Bug Pak&quot; &quot;High performance&quot;. He charged me 
full price. See what a laugh at the wrong time can do?

 I'll test them tomorrow and probably laugh some more.

 I'm not being too &quot;picky&quot; in my own opinion.

You can look in any &quot;speed shop&quot; catalog and they sell them as &quot;matched
sets&quot;. For about the same price I'm paying for stock trash.

 The quality of what's out there for vw is beginning to worry me.

 I am also beginning to sound like a wet dog smells.  :-)

 Read an article on &quot; charging the oil system for new engines.

 Seems the guy took an old Freon bottle and put a fill hole and an
air valve.

 Runs a long pipe into the bottle to reach the bottom, puts 4 quarts
of oil in and charges it with 20-30 psi air pressure.

 Has hose running from the &quot;pipe&quot; to a 1/8&quot; screw fitting.

 Pulls the oil sender and attaches the hose and opens her up.

 Fills and primes thru the oil galleys etc.

 This is an appealing doo-dad to me so some of you may find it 
interesting.
