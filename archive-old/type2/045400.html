Subject: [T2] Re: Auxilliary Battery Question

     I'm planning on installing an auxillary battery
in Fudd (Elmer E., my '78 Westy)  I'm curious whether
all electrical use such as radio, lights, etc will
then come soley from the new battery  or will it only
serve those things I connect directly to it.

Thanks
