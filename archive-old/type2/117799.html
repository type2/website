Subject: Re: [T2] Need parts 

Gary/Jason,

Richard and I had the same type problem with the gas/gas tank.

My pics are here  http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/78bustankjob/

I did essentially the same thing as you in trying to clean mine out 
without removing it, except I used the only thing I could find that 
seemed to melt it(paint thinner)and pumped it throught the tank a lot.

Paint thinner ***will*** eat the rubber lines...I threw them away.

As you can see from my pics, it still wasn't enough either.  Picture #12, 
the stuff was about 1/4&quot; thick all over the bottom of the tank.

I wonder if what you ended up with on your valves was rubber melting from
the hoses for some reason.

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; remaining in my tank. I sure thought I had cleaned it out. I worked on

&gt; I would say if you only used gasoline to flush the tank, you weren't 
&gt; thorough enough.
