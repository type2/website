&gt; No one in the after market makes a more robust starter at anything like the 
&gt; 
&gt; price of genuine article specifically manufactured to fit right.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;My understanding is that the Bosch starters are kinda weak design-
&gt; 
&gt; What evidence do you have of Bosch weaknesses??? I can't tell you how many 
&gt; of them I have seen over 30 years old and still function nominal. Rarely do 
&gt; I replace one less than 20 years old. I've pulled a bunch of no-name remans 
&gt; that sure didn't have the appearance of being more than a few years old.
&gt; 
&gt; 

Hello All     I agree wholeheartly with the doc on this.  In fact check to 
see if a new unit is out there, they are a whole lot better than re-man.  the 
new will have a N suffix instaed of a X   like sr17N    later and have fun  Mark
