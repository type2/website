Before anyone can answer that question, they need to know where you live.  I live in Connecticut.  During the winter my family would
always take coats, hats and gloves when we went for any drive over 20 minutes in the winter.  Most of the time we would wear the coats.
This was in a well sealed 71 Westy with the outside temperature below 30 degrees.  The heater boxes make a difference but not as much as
you would like.

&gt; Hi folks,
&gt;
&gt; Well, it's starting to get cold here and although I don't plan on driving my camper much in the winter months, I would like to take it
&gt; once in a while.  So I have a stock 1600 dp with NOS heat exhangers from
&gt; The Bus Depot,  since I've never really driven my camper yet I was
&gt; wondering how well they work when temps get down into the teens.  My
&gt; camper(70 Westy) isn't perfect in the door seal area but I plan on fix-
&gt; ing that soon.  Should I bring a sweater for city driving and long
&gt; sleeve shirt for the highway?  All the ducting under the bus is in great
&gt; shape and I have the belly pan.
&gt;
&gt; Just curious.
