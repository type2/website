Subject: '72 Westie for sale, Minneapolis

Listees,

I have made a tough decision to put my '72 Westie up for sale.  It 
has a used motor in it now, not rebuilt.  It needs work. Windshield, 
brakes tires, rocker panels.  The inside is clean and complete.   I 
also have a basket case motor ready to rebuild.  Lots of parts 
including sliding door, hatch door, motor hatch door. Lots of motor 
parts (1700cc).  The bus is in decent shape for this part of the 
country.  It rolls and should drive, but I am not calling this a 
drivable bus.  It needs a few things to be truely drivable. The price 
is negoitable depending on what you need.
	I decided to post this to the list first.  If anyone is 
interested p-mail me and I can provide further details.  I would 
rather not part it out.  The thing is in fairly decent shape, but I 
just don't have the time or the inclination to spend money on its, 
especially since my wife got laid off and my kid is going to private 
college.  It has been sitting in my garage (never outside for 7 
years.  Time to give up on one dream.  I've got others.
