    Good evening all,

Started taking off the tin on my 2l, and to my surprise...I find that the
upper oil tube was sealed with silicon. It is both inside of the tube and
out. My question is, and I'm afraid that I already know the answer, should I
tear the motor all the way down? I wrote earlier that I heard the valves
tapping, slightly, not like when you start it up.

Please respond quickly, cause I don't want to have to drive my F*rd Windstar
to a VW event...even though it is a wannabe bus!!!
