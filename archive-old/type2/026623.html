Condition of the Engine and My Analysis

	On tear down I found the following conditions and I want to see if I
am reading the engine's demise properly.

	The number 2 piston rod was totally disconnected from the
crankshaft.  Both rod nuts, the rod bearing insert and the lower part of the
rod were in the bottom of the case.  The rest of the rod was wedged in the
right half of the case casting where it broke a lifter and some to the
casting that retains the lifter.  I had to pry the rod out with a screw
driver.  Big and small pieces of magnesium were scattered throughout.  

	The rod itself and the crank are discolored (dark blue) which I
believe is from the excess heat that was generated by friction between the
rod and the crankshaft.  The rod insert bearing was significantly chewed and
scored and partially gone.

The number 2 piston barrel had pieces missing where the barrel meets the
case from the rod banging against it .  The pieces were found in the sump.

	All 4 barrels had metal shavings on top of the pistons, I did not
measure but I would say a tablespoon or so of fine (probably steel) shavings
in each.

	I suspect that the number two rod was not properly torque when
installed and that there was no 300 mile oil change.  The suspended
particles from piston/barrel wear in helped to plug the oil passages on the
number 2 rod which caused friction to overheat and eventually to loosen the
rods nuts and fly off.  I also suspect that the rod must have been knocking
for some time based on the discoloration and that the engine was driven
until catastrophic failure.

	Based on this information does my conclusion sound reasonable?  Are
there any other things that I should look for in this engine.  This engine
case is not rebuildable but I want to make sure I understand what happened
so I don't have the next engine suffer a similar fate.

Bus History

	Lizzard is a 1969 Westy that had a &quot;seized motor but was recently
rebuilt prior&quot; when we bought it.  I knew that it may or may not be
rebuildable but I hoped for the best.  The last person to drive the bus was
a Kent State University student (4 dead in OH-Hi-O...) who told the next
owner who told the person I bought it from that the engine was rebuilt in
Maryland (1992 I think, the bus has 1992 Maryland plates still) prior to the
student returning to school.  The engine is a 1600 Single Port with a
Mexican case and Brazilian pistons so it is not the original engine.  The
bus apparently broke down on the trip to Ohio was towed the rest of the way
and was never repaired and consequently sold and resold.

	After we bought the bus we had it towed the 20 miles or so to our
house.  During the tow, the poptop was ripped off with only a few shreds
left attached to the bus (dents in the roof, wiper arms torn off, paint
scraped, canvas gone, etc.).  The driver and the owner of the towing service
swore there was no roof when the arrived &quot;someone must have stolen it before
we got there&quot;.  However I found the top in several pieces along the
interstate on the route they took to our house.  I picked up a few small
pieces late that night, by 6:15 the next morning to towing people had
removed the rest and destroyed the evidence.  I followed up the Dept. of
Transportation, Highway Patrol, county sherrif and local police - none of
them was involved in the removal of the pieces.  I was beginning to question
the purchase at this point.   

	If you need a bus towed in the Akron area contact me first.  I know
who not to call. 

Thanks,

Andy Milks
