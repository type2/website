As promised, we've added a couple of pics of our new PLF canvas (thanks
Dawn!). Another thing we did to make the installation easier was to
remove the top cot, as it was a bear to try and work around it. Gonna
leave it out for now, as we've never used it, but we're keeping it,
'cause ya never know! It does open up a lot more usable space with it
out. The pics are at.....

For anyone contemplating replacing their canvas, it's not that hard,
just takes time and patience....go for it, you'll like the results!
