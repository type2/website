&gt; Found a 1971 for sale $500.00. Has the usual rust but the PO has all

&gt; person. Has an oil cooler leak (+/-). Has Westy interior(+). Needs
&gt; tires and 
&gt; brakes (+/-). Owner saved all parts, plus has extra stuff that goes
&gt; with/for 
&gt; the bus(+).
&gt; 
&gt; Has been welded up with &quot;horns&quot; so (owner speaking) &quot;that it can
&gt; accept a

&gt; FROM THE 
&gt; CONTINIUM.

Owner doesn't know what he is talking about.  '71s came with type 1
motors from the factory.  The owner probably thinks that it should have
a type IV engine.

&gt; What do you all think? Worth the price? What about the welding up for
&gt; bug 
&gt; motor?

For $500 you can't go too far wrong if the bus is intact.
