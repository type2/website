There's no AFM on the Type 3, they use a Manifold Pressure Sensor.

It is indeed sad to see perfectly viable old VW's in the junkyards ..  
and
non VW's as well.  There was a *beautiful* '72 Mercedes 2x0 coupe in
a yard here a few weeks ago that broke my heart to see in there, not a
thing wrong with it.   I've seen sharp Volvo 122's and BMW 2002's in
the past, and an absolutely *cherry* Opel Kadett one time.

While it's not so much the case in the Type 2 world (though it is to a
degree) with Type 3 it's very much the case that &quot;some must die that
others may live&quot; because there are few new parts available.  And I've
done a couple &quot;nose jobs&quot; on those cars when they've been hit, it's not
easy.  Plus, the only place to get replacement panels is another car...
