Subject: Steves Lock Shop/ Thank You

Just wanted to let everybody know exactly how good it feels to slide a 
freshly code cut key into the ignition of my ' 78 Westy. I'm prolly gonna 
have to go shower off after I write this! Huge thanks to Steve Sandlin at 
Steves Lock Shop. Great service, low prices and an absolutly stunning turn 
around time. Restores my faith in humanity, at least till I gotta deal with 
my mother-in-law....
Sionara,
Schrof
