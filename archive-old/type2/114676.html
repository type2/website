Subject: Re: [T2] Best Spark Plugs for my 76 2.0L FI

Jon,
Interesting details, that go beyond my scope of actual experience.
A book worm I'm not--just have a love for experimentation and if it
works out well--I write the results down for future reference.

Here in the Midwest--especially here in the Chicago area with the
bizarre temp extreme's I find that using one heat range hotter than
standard works out real good--in all temperature conditions--in the
fall, winter , and Spring--where it can go fro  30 one day and 80 the
next--

In the colder months when 80 percent of the driving time is one the
enrichment circuit, the hotter plugs help a bunch--and the platinum
plugs do to to avoid fouling, on a regular basis.

Standard plugs of any manufacture I find replacement once a season an
essential PM item--where the gold platinum tipped plugs seem to last a
bunch longer-- the firing ring stays cleaner and requires less
maintenance--as does the electrode.

But what do I know--
There are some that require a Johnson Bar to alter their prehistoric
though process--and will not under any circumstance give any new
technology an opportunity to alter their antiquated ideas.

I'm done with this one--I said plenty--

And trying to talk anyone into something they have not had one iota of
experience with--other than what they have perused in some magazine is
an impossibility.

I get a big kick out of Dr.Tim comparing the recommendations from Benz
and apply that to an antiquated push rod Wasserleaker--or for that
matter an air cooled more antiquated engine.

Real fair comparison.

And the best deal is a big voltage ignition system isn't required to
cause these plugs to fire efficiently--it would be better of course--but
not really needed.

A cople of my older Triumphs--my 67 TT special, and my 68 T100C had
whats called an ET ingnition system--no battery at all--it depended upon
the widings in the stator to produce enough juice to fire and the speed
y leg would turn the engine over--and the NGk gold plugs had no problem
in firing efficiantly--and clean.

Thanks for the info--very interesting stuff---

Later,

Terry

Hi Terry,
                I too prefer NGK plugs.
Actually I prefer anything coming from companies that listened to that
American genius Dr Deming (http://www_dot_deming_dot_org/) Neither VW nor MB
listen much, but all the Japanese companies did and still DO. That's why
they have reliable products. I too found a long time (~3O years) ago
that the NGK (or the Bosch too, actually) platinum plugs worked much
better in two cycle engines (Yamaha, Suzuki and Kawasaki in my case) and
then we started to use them in four cycle engines. Much less fouling and
electrode erosion. No problems. A lot of folk do not seem to realize
that there is a very small CURRENT (~50 milliamps) forming the spark at
the plug and it does not need a large electrode cross section. However,
it greatly prefers a sharp edge or point to depart from and that is
EXACTLY what the thin platinum electrode provides throughout it's life.
A large voltage is needed to initiate the spark and that is greatly
reduced by the presence of sharp edges or points at the gap. If folks
want to give their regular plugs a birthday, file the end of the ground
electrode square so there is a sharp edge on the corner nearest the hot
electrode. There, you just lowered the spark initiation voltage needed
by several thousand volts.
For your enjoyment check this test stand out. You will notice that there
are multiple spark gaps along the top. Close inspection, and reading of
the spec, will show that the spark gap assemblies are interchangeable-
three sets of options. This provides both the easiest spark gap (sharp
points = fresh plugs) and the hardest (smooth spheres = old plugs). Our
test stands (Bristol Centaurus and P&amp;W) also allowed us to pressurize
the gaps, and depressurize the magneto, to get an idea of in use
performance at altitude.

Reach (amount of thread) and heat range (tip operating temperature
during the NON FIRING period of the engine cycle) are essentially
unrelated aspects of a spark plug design. I.e. if you don't have enough
thread you have the wrong reach, NOT the wrong heat range. In crude
terms, heat range is determined from needing to keep a high enough temp
at the electrodes to keep them free of too much carbon build up, which
interferes with spark initiation, and cool enough to prevent
pre-ignition of the fresh charge prior to the electrical ignition spark.
Here is where really old plugs with excessively thinned ground
electrodes shift things a bit. One, they go up in temp a bit more during
the combustion cycle and two, they cool down a bit faster when the
incoming charge hits them. It may end up being a wash but it IS
different to the original spec. IIRC the change out spec is 50% of the
original electrode cross section.
If there is one general truth in ignition it is that you CANNOT keep an
ignition system TOO clean. Wiping your dizzy inside and out with a clean
rag and cleaning the wires and plug insulators (gentle solvents and no
abrasives please) will do more to ensure reliable ignition than anything
else.
