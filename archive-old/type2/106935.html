Steve, and all,

There is such a thing as a arm &amp; hammer powered panel cutter--

It cuts the panel with the blow from the hammer---in a perfectly
straight line--

Old school stuff--but still obtainable from any better body shop supply-

I believe a torch in a bone yard for Joe Q customer is a no-n--big
possibility of a large class action litigation when the big bang
happens--

Later

Terry

I want to go to my local Junk Yard to get some body pannels. Can anyone
recomend some portable cutters to remove bits. Thinks of wheel well
parts rear corners, pedistals.
Cutting torch not allowed ?
Plasma cutter not portable?
An inexpensive power inverter will provide the current you need to use
drill, grinder, sawzall, soldering iron, lamps, and extension cords. It
makes all your regular power tools portable. Can't take in your vehicle
? Bring a battery. Dave \X/
