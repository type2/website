Subject: the new engine trip report.... Getting it ready.

Fellow Listees...
	I've had a heck of a time these few weeks getting my '70 Westy ready
for the LEAF festival this past weekend... 
	To begin, I started by exorcising the electrical demons and putting
wires back where they were supposed to be hooked on the back of the fuse
box... the interior &quot;key-in, door-open&quot; buzzer had been replaced with an
*american* car flasher unit, since (I suppose) they mistook it's
plaintive, frail attempt at buzzing for a malfunctioning flasher unit,
since the flashers didn't work... the flashers didn't work because of
improperly hooked-up wires to the actual flasher relay... after that was
resolved, i noticed that I still couldn't get the headlights to go from
bright to dim, and that the headlight relay had been tampered with. Upon
removing the relay cover, i could see that the arm across the top of the
relay had completely rusted out, causing the relay to quit working...
(and this, because of the pinholes under the front windshield...) so,
after some trial and error, a working replacement arm was carefully
crafted in the old-world style, out of a large paperclip. It's not every
day that one is able to fix a relay, so i was quite pleased... relay in,
dimmer working...
	So what else needed to be done? Well, I was getting tired of
double-clutching 3rd and 4th gears, although it kept those CDL skills
fresh on the brain... the pedal-to-the-floor brakes had already been
fixed by adjusting, so they were okay. A woeful compression test yielded
the following results for the sick engine: 0 in #1, 100 in #2 and #3,
and 75 in #4. It wasn't losing oil, so i figured that the likelihood of
a burned piston was remote. My guess is that it was the exhaust valve...
but that remains to be seen, since the longblock still rests whole on
concrete blocks, dripping the remnants of its oil into a drain pan. If I
get really industrious, I'll remove the sparkplug and apply shop air to
the hole when #1 is at TDC, and listen for the location of escaping
air...
	I pulled the engine and tranny as one unit, after spending considerable
time with a pick cleaning the crud out of the CV bolt-head recesses and
removing the driveaxles.
	I had another engine case awaiting new parts that was to be the
candidate for this rebuild. Together with a good crank, new cam and
matched &amp; balanced rods &amp; 85.5 mm pistons, I was happy... My search for
shims to get lower compression involved several trips to Larry's Hot VWs
in Harriman... since I accidentally got head &quot;spacers&quot; the first time,
and wasn't about to put them on the motor. I ended up getting more or
less what i needed, though i fudged a bit by using 2 shims under each
cylinder... 1 .030&quot; and 1 .045&quot;, the .045&quot;s cannibalized from a 1500cc
also awaiting a rebuild. 
	I found that the 1700/1800 cc head spacers, with a little sanding on
the inside rim, would fit perfectly onto the cylinder bases of my
85.5s... but i didn't go that route since I was wary of the aluminum
compressing over time/engine heat cycles/and so on... Still, i bought a
set just in case... I ended up with about a 6.6 to 1 compression ratio
after all was carefully extrapolated and checked.
	Heads... new SP heads from CB... $300 for the pair to my door. polished
and matched for ccs, with all valve stem heights equal (no, they didn't
come that way), I was glad to install them at last. I remembered this
time to be sure and install the Kool-Tins before I bolted the heads
on... nice not to have to tear that apart again like i have spaced out
before and had to do...
	 Another great lump of time was spent sandblasting all engine tin and
repainting it... plus the heater boxes. plus slicing and flattening-out
the dimples on the lower shroud pieces to allow for the kool-tins and
doing the necessary welding... flat black is the color scheme.
	After what seemed like 6 months, i got the heat riser tubes on the
intake unplugged... 
	I also went to a machine shop and had two pulley-hubs turned down to
1.765&quot; to facilitate the use of a sand seal on this engine... i got to
see it done, which was nice. 
	Doing some primitive machining of my own on a drill press with a file,
some fine sandpaper, and a brass fitting, i was able to make another
shift bushing for the front of the shift rod. I think it ended up being
10 mm ID, 14 mm OD, with a tiny flange left on the outside to prevent
the works from disappearing into the depths of the shift rod. A little
JB weld to make sure it stayed put, and it was done... I didn't have to
make the rear coupler, thankfully, and it went on without a problem.
	Meanwhile, I removed, cleaned, regreased, and reinstalled the CV joints
with new boots and clips, protecting them with plastic bags. I was
having trouble at this time locating the cylinder shims, and so...
	I went ahead and swapped the tranny for my spare one. i had to use the
old clutch tube mounting bracket, and the front nosecone bracket and
seal thingy. Having nothing else to do, i reinstalled the tranny and
driveaxles.
	More boredom inspired the Hooverizing of the firewall with a bulkhead
fitting for the metal fuel line and new rubber line. This wasn't hard to
do, since I went down to the hardware store after reading his article on
them and bought several boxes of the threaded lamp tubes and nuts, and
already had them in the toolbox.
	Once the longblock was together, i installed the heater boxes and the
new cheap exhaust that was in the back of the bus when i bought it, and
tacked-on the lower exhaust flanges... in my haste accidentally cutting
off the tiny flares on the tailpipe tubes instead of the ones for the
heater boxes... oops.
	That done... several hours were spent cussing and fighting with the
cheap exhaust getting the heat risers to line up properly. There oughta
be a law...
	Another hour or three was devoted to getting the alternator and tin
properly set up... since i used all the tin, flaps, etc., from the motor
that came in the '70... and I had to change the backing plate and hub to
get it right.
	The crankshaft end play... I got it dead-on to a hair less than .003
after browsing the shim stack and installing them and the flywheel
several times, and rechecking what I had...
	New pressure plate and clutch disc... and the *flywheel*, oh, there's a
different story. I just grabbed a good o-ring flywheel from the storage
area, not really paying attention to the teeth. It happened to be a 6V
flywheel... I now know what the horrendous sound of 12V starter and 6V
flywheel attempting to mesh sounds like... a 6V starter and adapter
bushing solved that, although i waited until the trip was over to fix
that part of it... Someone posted about using a tap to get the old
bushing out, which I used. Thanks! It worked, albeit slowly... 
	I remembered that one of the lower engine mounting studs had broken off
at the case, and so dealt with that... I used my reverse-drill bits to
no avail, but drilled through the stud and retapped the hole. It was a
wee bit off center, but mild tapping with a brass hammer on the new stud
produced good results.
	All else went together without notable incident... including the full
flow system... the spin-on mount is attached to the front side of my
trailer hitch.
	And... it started up on the first try, thankfully, after the initial
easy-crank to build oil pressure. Rev-up for the cam-lobe lube thing for
a few minutes, then let it rest...
	I also had to remove a light socket for the right rear and tack in a
new one to the &quot;bucket&quot;... the old one was shorting out too easily.

Thanks,
