&gt;Could a coil do that?

Yes, or an intermittent short in the FI wiring.  A bear to hunt down...
Check all connections first, then try a different coil.  A trick that once
worked for me was to pull and tug on the various ends of the wire harness
while the engine was idling and try to make it stall.
