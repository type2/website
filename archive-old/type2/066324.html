Subject: shuddering clutches

I've noticed several discussions of shuddering clutches over the last
few weeks, along with various possible causes.  One cause I haven't
seen mentioned, which appears to have been the cause of my clutch
problem, is the pressure plate bolts coming loose.  I made a point of
actually using the torque wrench when installing my new pressure plate
and friction plate on my new engine a while back.  A couple of weeks
later, I had really bad shuddering.  I removed the engine for its
retorquing and all, and examined the clutch.  At that time, I posted
about the problem, and mentioned various anomalies about the friction
plate.  I then reassembled everything (using the same plates as
before), again using the torque wrench.  The shuddering almost
completely disappeared after that.  It's slowly coming back, which I'm
taking to mean that I need to retorque the bolts again.

In any case, it's a relatively cheap thing to try....
