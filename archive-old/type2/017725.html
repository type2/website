Finally got a round tuit...

Maureen, the 72 bus has been sitting idle since late winter.  The PO had not
been able to get the exhaust pipe on the head properly, so he jacked up the
left heat exchanger til it was tight against the head (Ouch!) and welded the
ears of the heat exchanger port to the studs.  Exhaust system was leaky and
noisy when I got it.

Three days of spare-time just removing the two studs.  Well, one stud.  The
other absolutely, positively wouldn't come out though it was
propane-torched, liberal application of Liquid Wrench, vice grips, repeat ad
nauseum.  I ruined a nice pair of genuine Vice Grips trying.  Hands are
still sore.

So I opened the heat exchangers to find the leak.  Couldn't find one.  Put
'em back together.  Leak was (apparently) at the gasket between heat
exchanger and muffler.  If'n I'd'a looked harder the first time...  Muffler
was rusty and rattly anyway, bought a new one from Bus Depot.

Incidentally, opening and closing the heat exchangers wasn't nearly as bad
as I'd expected.  Just be sure to pry the joint wide open before
reassembling, so's you can get the edge of the second half into the joint.
Pinch it closed all around with Vice Grips.  About an hour for each.

Put heat exchangers back on CORRECTLY this time, less missing stud.  Attach
new muffler.  New parts are SOOOOO much easier to work with than used ones...

Insert spark plugs that had been removed to check compression.  Thanks to
whoever suggested the method for getting the proper angle on the plugs:  put
long extension on socket, mark a spot in engine compartment where extension
points.  It helped a LOT.  Clean oil and dirt off the plug wires, stick em on.

Cross fingers, speak gently to Maureen, turn the key.  R-R-r-r-r---

Jump battery.  Try again.  R-R-R-R-VROOM!  She's alive!  and just in time.
My Taurus whose water pump was just replaced...won't start...  I think the
Taurus is jealous because I didn't name it.

Hint to newbies like me.  Buy a proper pair of coveralls and wear them when
working on the bus.  It intimidates the bus into thinking that you're a
proper mechanic.

Time to go to the tire store for new shoes all around, then mess about with
the brakes.

P'rfesser
72 bus, &quot;Maureen&quot;
