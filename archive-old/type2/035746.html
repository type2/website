Craig,


Congrats on that find! I've only seen one, myself. I
coulda bought it, but didn't have an extra $200.00
laying around!!!! The one I saw was for '68 and later
and had aluminum ends on it.

I don't know if the earlier ones were steel or
not....maybe try the vintage list.

Even if it's a repro, if the price is right, go for
it! I know I would!
