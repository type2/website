Subject: Vw on the Simpsons!

Last night on the Simpson's Halloween Special, the first of three that
night, I think it was a re-run, there was a green on green splittie that
got crushed by a giant Ken Brockman (I think it was Ken).

It was only on screen for a second, so I couldn't get more of an ID.
