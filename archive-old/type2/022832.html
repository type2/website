Hello list   Let me tell you about the time I lost the &quot;grub screw&quot; from the 
GHOOST    in the middle of the worst section of Greensboro at 11:00 pm.  If 
you have noticed this screw is tottally different from any other ona bus. I 
used an engine screw that was smaller and wrapped it in place with electric 
tape drove 2000 miles like that , replaced and wired when I got home.  Mark
