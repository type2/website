Subject: Re: [T2]Testing a alternator OFF the bus???????

(1)  Advance Auto uses the 'M' pigtail.

(2) You should have no wires coming out of your alternator.  You should 
remove the plate (three  nuts - don't mess with the screws...) from the back 
of  your alternator, and then you can ** take off the wire that goes from 
the alternator to the starter and ** unplug the other wires.
