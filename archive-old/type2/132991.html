Subject: Re: [T2] More foam seals - engine compartment

Scott,

I agree, especially since I have used a torch on those
playtoys to try and mold some of it.

They are made from the same poly type plastic as milk cartons.

Beware the melting process!

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; Hi Chris,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Forget the hardware aisle and head over to &quot;Sports&quot;. I was thinking
&gt; &gt; about trying a poly-urethane foam &quot;Swim noodle&quot; in this application.
&gt; 
&gt; for goodness sakes, the original seal is 30 dollars. i can understand making
&gt; the part if it is either very expensive or NLA, but this seal is neither,
&gt; and it is a critical part. it is available at any vendor that sell bus
&gt; parts.
