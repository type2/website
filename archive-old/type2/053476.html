The only complaints you have on your 77 are no heat and the sliding door 
doesn't work.  That's what I'm gathering from this messege.  OH.  It has some 
more rust.  I'm not an expert, by no means, but if it's mechanically sound 
(is it?), I would personally not spend the extra cash that I don't have on 
the 77.
