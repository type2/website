&gt; I put a new radio and speakers in this weekend. I used the red radio wire

&gt; didn't want to worry about leaving the radio on by accident when not in the
&gt; car, I ran the power through the ignition switch rather than using the same
&gt; unswitched power. I could not find a reference to nor could I locate an
&gt; &quot;accessory&quot; position in the key switch that would allow me to have the radio
&gt; on with nothing else. As it is, I can turn the radio on when the various
&gt; warning lights etc come on just prior to cranking.  Is there an accessory
&gt; position that I missed?
&gt; If not, is there any harm in having the vehicle &quot;on&quot; for any length of time
&gt; just to listen to the radio? Is anything actually on other than the warning
&gt; lights?

&gt; Thanks,

&gt; WestonI'm not sure which model you have... but as I recall, my '73 had an 
accessory position that came on when the key was pushed in and turned 
&quot;backwards&quot; (in the same direction as you turn off the ignition). I seem 
to recall these busses had the ignition marked accordingly.

&gt;From wiring numerous cars, you can go to the fuse box, and it's often 
marked with a radio prong. Also, if unmarked, you can find the proper 
place to splice by turning the ignition to the ACC position, &amp; seeing 
which terminals/wires are hot, turn it off &amp; see which go dead... and 
attach to one of those wires.  Most radios don't draw much power, so 
overloading a fuse is usually not a problem.

When you can't find the &quot;proper&quot; wire, this method will work.
