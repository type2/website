Subject: extra vacuum line on a '76

There is an 'extra' vacuum line coming thru the driver's side firewall.
Inside the engine compartment it is stopped off with a screw.

After it goes from the engine compartment thru the firewall, it connects
just in front of the one way valve for the brake booster line.  At a quick
glance, it does not look like a jury-rigged setup; the connection seems to
be a machined connection rather than a hole drilled into the line with RTV
all over it.

Is this a standard setup, like, to see the vacuum in the brake booster line
AFTER the engine is shut off??  Like doing a leak down test for the brake
booster.

Barry sends thanks to Mike Benthin for the torque specs on Saturday
