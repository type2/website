&gt; Excuse me, but I think you'll NEVER overheat your motor by using too low

&gt; outsid temps or steep grades- drop down a gear.( And of course, slow
&gt; down a little)

        Not so Al; Last Fall when I drove up to WI from Mobile, AL, and my tranny
locked into 3rd at CaveCity, KT (just about exactly half way) I ended up driving
the next 550 miles in 3rd. I was very grateful for the oil temp gauge, which I
used to regulate my speed, so that I kept the temp under 240. Since I had no real
problem driving in 3rd at 55, without the gauge I probably would have done that
--- driving at 45 for 550 miles is a real PITA. The temptation to go faster is
pretty strong, but faster than 45-50 put the temp over the edge, and if fact, 50
was often too fast.
       So Ray's example is a good one -- because, as he said, on a gravel road
you can't hear the engine, and wouldn't realize what gear you were in. Having
spent many, many years in the northwoods driving a bus on gravel roads almost
exclusively, I know that to be true, and since my approach to gravel roads is
that the faster you go, the smoother the road gets, I usually try to drive at
least 55-60 on gravel.
