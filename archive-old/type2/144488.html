Subject: BusQuinox Campout next weekend near Toronto

Hi Volks,

Another forward from my buddy Adam of Suburban Design Core:




Hi Folks,
Uncle Doom here with a &quot;new&quot; event. That's right, just
like &quot;new coke&quot; was like all the other cokes, just a
bit different, here's a &quot;new event&quot; that will taste
like other events, just a bit different.
Somehow...that makes sense....to me.

All the details can be found at:
http://www.busesofthecorn_dot_com/suburban/BQ/index.html

Here's a summary:
Date: September 17th - September 18th
Location: Valens Conservation Area, Hamilton ON ASPEN
COVE group site.
Cost: $22.50 _at_ the gate, $5 to me for the reservation
fee.
Time: anytime after 2 pm.
Events: Egg balancing, tree looking, and apparently
naked fire dancing. Bring your own wood. ;-)
Shirts: $15

For more details pmail me at adoom_at_rogers_dot_com

See you there!!
Adoom
