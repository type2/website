Subject: Re: [T2] Removing Undercoating??

Kevin,


To remove the undercoating first try mineral spirits---soak it and puddy
knife it off--
If that doesn't work--it's time for the laquer thinnner---soak it again
and more puddy knife.

A super durable undercating is spray on or brush on bed
liner---Herculiner or Rino Hyde by name.
About $85.00 a gallon ,but well worth the money--it's a urethane
rubber--and doesn't come off ---( pity the guy who tries and remove this
stuff)

And now that I think of it there is a product by Morton--spray can Bed
liner---I used it on the bottom of my85 4 years ago--and it's all still
there---pretty easy to use, a bunch cheaper.

Later,

Terry

Removing Undercoating??

Hi Everyone,
Cleaning up my Westy so I can undercoat it but I need to remove some
undercoating on one the battery trays so I can fix some rust issues.
Anybody know a easy way to get that stuff off? the trays are little
fradgile these are the ones in the engine compartment but I don't know
what to call them. Also anybody recommend a certain undercoating that
will hold up to a vt winter? It won't be driven much but enough to go
throught the PITA of reundercoating it. Thanks
kevin
