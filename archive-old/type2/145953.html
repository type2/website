Subject: Re: [T2] Best Way to Restore Wheels

&lt;Hope someone on the list can help me...I'm restoring my type 2
and having trouble sourcing original luftschachtklebeband (Ger-
man duct tape, thanks, Babelfish... ;-)&gt;

Which is certainly inspected and certified by the T.U.V. I'm sure... Let's see, would that be &quot;160 KPH Tape&quot; in Germany?

Hey Terry... What were the particulars on that $15K '78 Westy Champagne Edition? Low miles? All original? Seats still wrapped in plastic? German air still in the tires?

Chris
Cookeville
'78 Westy 2,7L with 200K miles, some wear and tear and certainly not worth $15K...
