hello all,

i have a friend with a 72 bus that wants to keep the original vent
windows.

are the seals for the stationary glass next to the vent window, and the
seals for the vent window itself available anywhere? (with or without trim
groove on the stationary part, though she prefers with the groove...)

I am pretty sure that they arent, but this may have changed recently.

thanks,

Steve
