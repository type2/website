&gt; Here's a question though, with the new CV's (Lobro) how tight should
&gt; they be? Of the 4, two are that tight I cannot move the inner race
&gt; relative to the outer race at all by hand. The other two move quite
&gt; easily, but without any 'play'. Is that normal?

Not normal. The two tighter cv joints will destroy
themselves if you run them very far.
Disassemble them and turn the races one ball in either
direction and reassemble, the flex will return to normal.
