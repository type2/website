Platinum plugs are useful in high-voltage ignitions systems where you
won't pull the plugs for 100K miles.  For ordinary VW point ignition
systems, you will do fine with the W8AC plugs.  Save your money.

&gt; Hi group
&gt; 
&gt; Went to Autozone for a set of platinum spark plugs. They consulted their 
&gt; computer and came upn with the Bosch standard WR8CP and the Bosch Super W8CC 
&gt; kind. The counter lady said the super duty is for &quot;trailer towing&quot;

I'll bet the &quot;R&quot; means &quot;resistor&quot;, which you don't need because the
distributor has a resistor built into the rotor.

The counter lady probably isn't the person to trust for spark plug advice.
