Hi All,

	After I got home from my Daughters sixth grade graduation last night
(She received a Presidential Gold Award for having an A average for the past
four years) I had a few minutes to look under my 70 Westy dash again for the
missing coil wire. Found it in about 5 seconds, reconnected it to the fuse
box, and took her out for a little spin. Now I can have it re-inspected this
weekend. Thanks to everyone who sent morale support. A couple of questions :
What is the correct part number for the rear tail/stop light, and what can I
use that will be a bit brighter? Anyone going to the New Hampshire show this
weekend?

Thanks 

Jeff
