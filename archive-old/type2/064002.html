Subject: Lincoln Welder 100 Quests

Thom et al.,
        I am looking at the Lincoln model 100 welder for sale ($299) at a local
farm supply story in Iowa. I have never welded in my life but am willing
to jump in there and become one of the few, the proud, the type 2 home
restorers. Just wanted to get some advice if I could. I know some list
members have one and seem satisfied.
        Do you have the MIG adapter and how well does it work for most VW bus
work with or without it? What welding wires do you use? And finally did
you take any classes or just teach yourself from the video/instructions
included? Any comments would be much appreciated..
