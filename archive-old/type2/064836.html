&gt; &gt; &gt;Joel Walker wrote that his oil temp. dropped when he started using
&gt; &gt; &gt;Kendall oil, I was dubious, but I am totally convinced now.
&gt; &gt; &gt;It's GREEN, DOES reduce oil temperature a SURPRISING
&gt; &gt; amount!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;        Joel said he saw about a 20 degree (F) drop,
&gt;        I thought that was fanciful at best, but my
&gt;        oil temp. gauge told me exactly the same
&gt;        thing! I was amazed!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  Also, what kind of Kendall? Straight vis? Multi? Synthetic?
&gt; 
&gt;        20-50 &quot;normal&quot; oil, ie no synthetic
&gt;  
&gt; &gt;  What were you using before?
&gt; 
&gt;        Swore by Castrol, I'm never going back!
&gt;  
Kendall &quot;standard base&quot; oil probably has the best reputation in the 
industry for being &quot;THE&quot; oil.  The really good mechanics use this stuff. 
I commented before about the oil, assumming it was a synthetic, and 
attributed the lower oil temp to the oil not soaking up the heat (as the 
VW engineers originally intended - this way the case does not soak up the 
heat). I am pretty sure the oil is fine as long as it is not a synth base 
oil. My only other recommendation is using a straight 30w or 40w instead 
of multi grade. I hear the multi grades break down quicker.

My 2 cents!
