&gt;Another problem is that a lot of cheapo rebuilt Bus dizzies are actually in
&gt;Bug housings, sometimes with mixtures of Bug and Bus parts.  Vacuum cans
&gt;will again end up in odd places.  Strictly speaking any VW dizzy
&gt;practically will work in a T4 bus if you time it right but it won't
&gt;necessarily run well or fit nicely.

What John writes jives with my recent experience. My parts house, normally
a good source for the right parts, sold me a 113 905 205 for my bus. I had
them order it and they told me that's what was available from the rebuilder
and what was listed as the replacement dizzy. This number jives with a '74
Beetle and though it's in the same family as my 021 905 205P with the same
advance curve, the canister was on the opposite side of the dizzy!

I wound up having to spin the dizzy around and reposition the condensor in
order for it to work in the space alloted. Granted, I have a hose adapter
for my oil pressure sender that normally would not be in the way, but I
still would have had to spin the dizzy, even with the stock oil pressure
sender.

Take care! Joe
