Subject: Re: [T2] Battery Isolator Problem

VW went with the relay for specific reasons.  The same as many of the RV 
setup out there have.  Many alternators are not compatible with 
isolators.  Looking at the instructions for the isolators says the same 
thing.
The work arounds are not safe for the alternator.

&gt;&gt; Do yourself a favor.  Return the isolator and get a high-power relay 
&gt;&gt; that is simply wired to the ignition so that it will connect the 
&gt;&gt; batteries when the key is on.  The relay is available at Camping World 
&gt;&gt; and other places.  Plenty of info in the archives on this too.
