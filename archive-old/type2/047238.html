Subject: Re: [T2] heat exchangers

Well I called busdepot and asked about the problem they were very helpful .  Ron
suggested i heat the pipes and try to bend them a bit.  It worked.  It is still
very difficult to get them to mate but i can do it (without the studs i got the
wrong ones accidentally, ill have to go to vw and try to get the right ones from
them) Hopefully with the studs on it'll still fit. I m guessing the studs may
make the process easier as they should help guide the exchanger on?  One
remaining problem at the moment though,  the ends of the exchanger that connect
to the engine cooling fan.(not the blower in the engine compartment. don't close
there is a large gap on the top.. was the an shroud different on 72-74 buses
(ive forgotten what my 73 looked like) or could the dpo have ground them off (he
did many more stupid and seemingly random assaults against the bus) Im thinking
of just using some aluminum flashing to cover the gap, any other ideas or
problems with this one?  Does anyone know if the new accordion tubes contain
asbestos a different insulation?
Thanks
James
