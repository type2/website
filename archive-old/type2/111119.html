Subject: Re: [T2] External Oil Cooler Kits Whose to Use?

&gt; Any other thoughts here folks? I have not had much of a response to this
&gt; question and I would think you southern bus folks would be all over this
&gt; one...

Over the years the general concensus has been:

If your stock engine is running so hot as to need an additional oil cooler
you'll only be masking the problem.

Problems with cooling tin, mixture, compression ratio, etc could all be
causing your problems.
