Hey all we are just about finished packing and are heading out the door 8ish 
tomorrow morning.  If you see the yellow smiles on the white loaf give a 
wave.  I will try to post info on how it went as well as the magazine 
coverage like last year.  If you plan on attending I'll see you there. Friday 
night we'll be kicking it at the Morro Dunes Campground feel free to join in.
Peace Out
