I can't tell you how many times I have disassembled a Midas brake job,
clean everything they didn't clean, lube everywhere then didn't lube,
install per manual not the way they guessed, and resolved all squeeks. All
bets are off if they used the ultra cheap shoes and did not use genuine
German drums. I would take it back to them and let them know they are
responsable to make them noiseless and for goodness sakes adjust the
e-brake which is a standard part of procedure when ever replacing rear
shoes. Make them make it right under warrenty.

Otherwise, take it to any COMPETANT mechanic who knows about removing the
rear hub to give excellent access to do a much better job of inspection,
cleaning and lubricating the metal to metal contacts throughout. It's hit
and miss at Midas and throughout the industry, really. You might get a
seasoned pro (recently on the wagon?) or a part time college student at the
specialty franchise brake shops. Flip a coin. If you take the time to do
things right first time every time, these franchises don't think they can
afford you. Cheaper for an apprentice to do the job twice or more with very
cheap parts one out of every 10 jobs.

If you plan to be on San Juan Island sometime soon, I'd be happy to inspect
and present you with a solution. Squeeky brakes are well over 90% of the
time caused by incompetant and negligent procedure or just parts not in
spec. made on Chinese spec. machine tools by &quot;machinists&quot; working for a few
bowls of rice per day. 

Non-migrating silicon paste grease by Sta-Lube WORKS. It is specifically
designed for brake applications when used conservatively at the various
proper locations. Also the ticket for calipers and pads. I've had two
squeeky brakes come back out of a hundred jobs on European vehicles.
