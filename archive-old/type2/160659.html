Subject: Type 1 engine thermostat location

Where is the thermostat located on a type 1 engine??  I see so many beetles
in this yard that I am sure some of them should still have the thermostat on
them.

BTW, I pulled an EXCELLENT thermostat off a 914 1700.  I counted the bellows
and there are 12.  I pulled a BROKEN (expanded)thermostat off a 1979 type IV
engine and I counted the bellows and there were 10.

Can the 914 thermostat (12 bellows) be used in lieu of the type IV 910
bellows) thermostat, or is there something critical about the temperature
openings on the two.

TIA
