Subject: Porsche 944 Engine in a VW Possible?

Hi all!
I am a newbie with regards to VW vans, because I just recently bought my
first one!  It is a 1977, and has about 150k miles on the original engine
(wow).  However, I was thinking of replacing it with a Porsche engine,
because one of my relatives deals in any type of 944 part and could hand
an engine down to me.  I was wondering if this is possible to do and if it
would be worth doing to replace the engine.  Can someone please email me
a list of technical things that I would have to take into consideration
and any specifications needed?  Thanks in advance!!!!

-Mike B.
