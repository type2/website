Subject: 77 bus for sale

Hi All,   I've decided to part with my blue and white 77 bus and am asking
$600 to a good home.  I bought it from its first owner back in 1984.  It has
145,000 on the original strong engine.  It was my main car for a long time
but I got a 79 bus several years ago and pretty much retired the 77 to
occasional use.  I let the inspection expire a year ago and now only drive
it slowly  on back roads for exercise.  Probably could use a paint job and
general checkout of brakes,  and such, but engine seems to be in good shape.
I'm about 60 miles west of Washington, DC.
        Email me off list with questions and I can send you a photo.
                Mimi Cantwell
