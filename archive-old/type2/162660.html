&gt; Also reading the saturday newspaper and see a cool article on how to paint
&gt; your refrigerator so that it looks like stainless steel.
&gt;
&gt; What caught my eye was that they touted the paint as.....
&gt;
&gt; &quot;The brush-on &quot;paint&quot; is 100% stainless and automotive-grade.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Automotive grade!!!!!  &quot;brush on&quot;!!!
&gt;
&gt; Of course there is a catch...the price.
&gt;
&gt; Never mind the fridge--I wonder if two of these kits would be enough to
&gt; paint my old VW bus?
&gt; &quot;


 but the real important question, will it still rust???
