I just obtained six 30PICT carbs, brand new Volkswagen brand, for $109.95.
These fit the single port engines (thru 1970) and have 12 volt chokes. These
are genuine VW (Brazil), not the Brosol/Bocar aftermarket ones normally
available.  My part number is 113 129 027K.  None more when these six are
gone.

I also got four NOS genuine VW fuel valves, for the reserve gas tank on 55
and earlier Splitties. This is the part with the hand valve for switching to
your aux gas tank. Price is $39.95.  Part number 211 209 021A.

You can order by email, or toll-free (1-888-819-DEPOT for orders by part
number only).   The carbs are also on the website (it does not specify that
they are genuine VW, but the next 6 I ship will be).  The fuel valves will
be on the site tomorrow at $44.95; specify that you're a listmember to get
the $39.95 price.
