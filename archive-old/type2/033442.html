Hey there Volks,

Tis the season to be silly, so I thought I'd follow in the footsteps
of some other listmembers. I'm gonna put christmas lights on my Westy
:)

What started as a passing thought about putting some christmas lights
on the spare tire up front, turned into a small project. I did some
&quot;research&quot; and consulted the Library and Archives.

The archives had some good theads. inverters, solar, deep cycle, etc.
When I searched on christmas AND lights, I found &quot;Fun inverter use
#42 - Christmas lights&quot; (thanks David S.), and all the stories where
a vw bus dashboard was &quot;lit up like a christmas tree&quot;. (not a good
thing) 

I've ordered a 600W dc to ac power inverter from darmark. 

I need to upgrade the existing aux. battery anyways, (as it's the
original and doesn't hold a charge for long), so can anyone recommend
marine/rv/golf cart batterys ? Interstate, Optima, or other brands?


TIA
