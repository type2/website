Subject: 1600sp w/dual kadrons &amp; wide-flange exhaust???

Hello all,

I'm rapidly running out of time to get my '69 Westy completed before
the wife and I move to Az.(from Portland, Or.) in July. I seriously
doubt that I will be able to finish everything else and build a new
1776 (and break it in) as well....

So my question...

If I install my dual Kadrons and a large flange exhaust on my existing
1600sp, can I expect to have any usable gain? I'm only interested in
pulling hills at a better pace and running 65mph whenever possible.
I've been told the above would equal a 20% Hp gain over the original
(5 Hp each=10 Hp/over the stock 50 Hp) T/F??

Would the above cause any excessive wear on my old 1600? I don't know
the date of the last rebuild or the mileage at that time, but the
compression is good.

Will this cause any change in running temps? Gas mileage?

Anyone out there running this set-up? Any other suggestions?

TIA

Jaime
