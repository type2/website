&gt; &gt; Mice have ate holes in the large (foamish seal?) It runs around the engine
&gt; &gt; and I believe seals against the tin? My question is what's this (seal?)
&gt; called. &gt; I'm trying to order from Ron or whoever but can't find it, I'm
&gt; sure it's sold and &gt; I'm just not calling it by it's right name. How far
&gt; around does it go, can you
&gt; &gt; get it all installed with the engine in? Can you replace just bad parts
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; you can get to? Is this seal pressure fit or do you use some kinda glue?
&gt; 
&gt; I call it an engine compartment seal, part number 411 813 225, $19.95 on my
&gt; website for a German one. (You can search by part number, now that you know
&gt; it, and order that way.)  It just pushes in; you can do it without removing
&gt; anything although you have to be somewhat of a contortionist to squeeze it
Ray:
I'd add to Ron's remarks:
It MUST be put in after the engine is in, therefore, no you don't have
to take the engine out to put it in. It's a friction fit, and like Ron
says, it's kind of a bear to get in in some spots.
They come with one side porous and one side smooth. I've never figured
out which goes where, but just put the smooth side up to keep it from
absorbing oil that might blow out. Does anyone on the list really know
which is correct?
