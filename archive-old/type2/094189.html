&gt; The 1st year was 1973. They are one-year-only with a release button on each

&gt; 74/75 were soft vinyl with a zipper along the bottom from post to post. Age is
&gt; catching up with them.....the material between the zipper and vinyl is
&gt; self-destructing and separating.
&gt; 75 to 79 are hard molded vinyl. The sun bakes the side edge and it has a habit
&gt; of cracking when pushed.
&gt; Any bay bus headrest will fit any bay seat from 73 to 79. They will not fit
&gt; Vanagon seats. The posts on Vanagons are smaller in diameter.
&gt; I have pairs in almost every color EXCEPT black. I have soft vinyl and hard
&gt; vinyl. 73-only is very hard to find. Black is very hard to find. The most
&gt; common hard vinyl is brown.

What's the best way to recondition the hard vinyl?
