&gt;In fact, the way Bentley reads, [79 heater boxes] weren't even
&gt;produced for a whole
&gt;model year, but maybe only 9 months.  I can't imagine retooling a whole
&gt;production line for that!

Well, they didn't re-tool just for that. They also re-tooled for those few
months to produce a one-year-only wider bay-window body, if I remember
right. I wonder if there was a single-year wide fiberglas top for the
single-year wide body? Resto-wise, there might be a whole slew of little
differences in the body and interior because of those extra inches...that's
assuming the suspension dimensions weren't changed...
