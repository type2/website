Subject: Wheel locks up/brakes grabbing
Date: Mon, 31 Jul 2000 10:12:44 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have a 1972 bus that I fully replaced the rear brakes on about 8 years ago
(no master cylinder replacement).  It then sat up some over this time period
(baby born, busy, etc, etc), with no appreciable miles

When I went to drive it recently, I found that when I come to a stop, that
the rear left (?) wheel locks and I have trouble stopping because the tire
just skids.

I have removed the drums and cleaned the rear-brakes, bled entire system,
readjusted the brakes, to no avail.

I'm wondering if the brake pressure regulator is shot.  Anyone ever had this
problem, or know a way to proceed?

TIA.
