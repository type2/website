&gt;i've heard, but don't know firsthand, that the reception for XM is very bad
&gt;in rural areas.


HOW???  The signal is coming from two satellites stationed in 
geosynchronous orbit (22,000 miles high) with clear view of rural 
areas,   canyons and mountain passes.  If you can see the sky, you can 
receive the signal.  You'd have possible problems in parking structures and 
tunnels, but what radio works in those?

Now if you want to pay the 10 bucks a month to receive the signal, that's 
another story.
