Subject: Re: [T2] Help! 68 Brake lights

I had similar problems to what you are having and finally solved it when I
took the turn signal assembly off the steering column and cleaned the
contacts.. They were all gunked up. This is really pretty easy to do. When
you open that assembly up and operate the switch you can see a moveable
contact and two stationary contacts. This is what needs cleaning. You can
use ordinary alcohol and Q-tips. I have also used strips of paper to clean
the old type electromechanical touchtone telephone dial pad contacts by
holding the number button down and cleaning the vertical and horizontal
contacts for it by pulling the strip of paper through under light pressure.
Same basic idea. You will see the difference in your contacts when they are
clean.. they will be bright and shiny and the &quot;gremlins&quot; in your brake and
turn signal systems will probably disappear. If this doesn't work, clean all
the contacts in your fuse block and the fuse ends (or use new fuses) and
consider investing in a pair of the newer manufacture tail light assemblies
which are not so prone to developing &quot;cold joints&quot; or corrosion in their
contacts.
