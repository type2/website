No, Alex that one is for the dome lights. Never seems to work right though. 

Kevin,
Does your switch have any marks on it. Does it match the other VW factory
switches or is it different. &quot;adjustable&quot; I assume you mean it Rotates? Are
there any wires connected to the back side? What year is the Bus? Give us as
much info as you can, it will be easier to help that way.

I have one of those switches with what looks like an eye lens with lines
radiating out of it.....what is this thing for??? Maybe it is for the
heater???

I have an adjustable switch on my dash between the headlight switch and the
steering column that I'm not sure what it is for because it isn't doing
anything currently.  Is it for the heater blower that my van is missing?  Or
what? The PO really did a piece of work on this bus but I love it anyway.  
Thanks.
