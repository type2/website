Subject: Re: [T2] AridZona

Just for the record this guy does not speak for me.I look at your listings
all the time.I may just decide I need another bus someday and a nice rust
free arizona bus would be a good choice.Its also nice to see all the bus
activites going on.I wish that much stuuf went on around here.Please keep
posting your vw related stuff.Its not like the list volume is that heavy
anyway.
