Subject: Re: [T2] Insulating a 68-79 westy pop-top

Hey Greg, Ronnie in VA. I was talking to EB Chris and to my best  
understanding he mentioned using that foil covered bubble wrap. Someone he knew  used it 
and seemed to like it. He had the pieces cut to fit the angles of the  pop top 
canvas and had it lay down when not in use and then fold them into place  
when needed. Had them on both sides and front, maybe a small piece in the rear  
for the small section. Might be an idea or one you can modify and improve. 
Chris if I misunderstood completely, Sorry. It was a campout and later  
afternoon so my mind may not have been all there. Not that it is during the day  or 
anytime for that matter but, if I'm wrong please correct me.
