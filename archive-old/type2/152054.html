&gt; Now, suggestion for removing a circlip without the necessary tools? I
&gt; figure maybe I can do it with some small screwdrivers.

circlip tool is inexpensive, $5 for a cheap one in the tool bin at your
local FLAPS.

but if you gotta.   two screwdrivers work but I suggest 3.  get the
biggest screwdriver (or similar) tool that will fit and hold it into the
center of the circlip.  use your shoulder.  then use the other two to pry
it apart, when it lets go it is likely to go sailing, maybe even hitting
you hard enough to draw blood but the 3rd screw driver is the catcher and
it just blings around it like a horseshoe.


good luck
Bob
