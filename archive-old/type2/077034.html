Subject: Re: [T2] Found Vanagon With Porsche Engine

&gt;I found a 1980 Vanagon (in a storage yard) its been there for three
&gt;years. The owner will sell it for storage charges of $2400.00.
&gt;The Vanagon has a 1972 Porsche 911T engine in it with a 5 speed tranny
&gt;and mechanical fuel injection (needs a $1300.00 fuel pump) he says. He
&gt;claims it to have a 3.2 Liter engine vs the lesser desirable 3.4 Liter.

For that era 911, it would be either a 2.2 or 2.4L. Mechanical fi is sweet
running, until the pump gets worn, then there are very few places to have
them properly rebuilt, and there are several hundred parts inside there.
The $1300 is probably just for the rebuild. R&amp;R and adjustments add 4 to 6
hours labor. Both mixture setting and linkage adjustment is critical for
proper function, but once you get it set, your good to go for 5 year checks
for sleight readjustment.  

&gt;My inquiry into the condition of the engine netted me a buyer beware
&gt;response of *it was running before the fuel pump quit*. 
&gt;Any chance this engine and tranny might be worth the $2400.00 he's
&gt;asking?

The injection pump or the fuel pump may have given up due to not being run
for many moons. If the motor shows good compression balance and is a proper
assembly (Porsche parts only), it might bring $1500 or more. If it came
with a build sheet from Competition Engineering or one of the other known
and repected builders, it might catch $3000.

If the tranny is 72 911 5 speed, and the syncros and bearings are in order,
it should get a grand or more. A reman done right (Porsche snychros and
bearings and seals) will cost at least a grand. Rebuildable cores are worth
$400-$600.

&gt;I'd curious to know the HP on the engine and likelihood that it might
&gt;transfer into a decent 80-83 Vanagon body.

From memory, around 140HP, but with improved air cleaners and a bit of fine
tuning they could be bumped up 20 HP or so without too much cost. If you
rebuild that stock motor with anti-shuffle pins, piston squirters and a cam
matched with Weber carbs, you could get right up to 180-200HP. 

Those early magnesium motor castings were a world design award winning
item. But they are too soft to build over 200hp. That means if this is an
early case, and it has been built to 3.2L, the crank, if still std, would
be worth $400-$600, the value of that or any other parts could only be
deterimined by teardown and inspection. But if it has been stressed from
overbuilding, expect the case to be warped and much havoc inside. The
compression balance test can tell you a lot about how fast you should walk
away, or whether a closer look is in order. Then you'll know more about
that engine then me or the current owner.
