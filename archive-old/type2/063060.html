Re source of model busses:

Go to a BugOut type Show- they have models- and try Frank Tyler, 1637
Bailey Hill Road, Eugene Oregon, 97402,  503-687-9187  - once a guru on
Prodigy who got off internet because too busy selling parts and restoring
busses- he has the biggest collection of bus models I've ever seen; he may
give you a lead on good sources??  MB
