Subject: Need help from engine builders

Hey all,
I've become very stoic about my rebuild.

Here's the latest senario that might cause the 80% complete longblock to
be torn down.  One of the cylinder studs on the 1600 DP is not holding
any torque.  Funny, it didn't when I measured deck height.  Ugh!!!!

You know, I've already had other case stud problems.  Twice now I've 
taken apart the shortblock; 1st time: cam plug stud stripped. (tear 
down, clean, machine shop,more cleaning,build up.)  2nd time: #3 main 
bearing stud stripped. (tear down, etc.etc.)  I finally get the short
block torqued to speck and the cylinders sealed to the case and the
Kool Tin in place,  I go to torque the cylinder studs in the pattern and
and one seems to be turning in it's threads( no metal shavings so 
hopefully not stripped)  I feel like breaking down and getting a new 
case.  I still could have problems with the 3/4 head!!!!!!!!!
BTW this is a AS41 Mexico case with case savers and deep studded.

Could really use some encouraging words right now.  Two months of work
are potentially slipping away.
Solutions:
Some sort of JB Weld??
Locktite on the threads??
Teardown and to machine shop??
Teardown and new case??

I need the list's opinions( don't forget the encouraging words)

Stoically yours,
