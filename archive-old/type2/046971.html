Subject: [T2] Chem-Clean: For Professional Use ONLY!!!!

Volks,

Because I have been dealing wiht a bunch of nasty ol' carb and other parts
lately, I went out looking for a good parts cleaner in bulk a while back.
I found a 1 gallon can and dipper basket wearing the brand name &quot;Chem
Clean&quot;.  Bought it and used it and I have to say that while it works a
treat for removing all sorts of nasty gunk form carbs, I cannot reccomend
it.  It is just way too toxic for my tastes.

Now understand that I say this as a smoker, drinker and retired swim suit
model.  With me, gloves have been very optional in my repair career, and
all sorts of other self-incriminatory statements about how dumb I can be.  
BUT...  I did my best to stay out of contact with this, used the provided
basket, etc. and still wound up smelling it, tasting it, and feeling CNS
effects from this stuff.  That from *very* limited contact.  It is bloody
DANGEROUS!!!!

The reason for using something like Chem-Clean is for removing the
baked-on varnish that is the souvenir of 40,000 gallons of gasoline from
inside the tiny passages in a carb.  That crap is hard to get off and
requires special and nasty solvents.  The general rule is to go up an
order of lightness in solvent to remove it.  Tar would come off with
grease (tho motor oil is more convenient :-), grease come off with motor
oil, motor oil in kerosene, kerosene in gasoline.  Cutting the residue of
gasoline is like scratching a diamond!  Certainly going up more than one
order will work and I used kerosene for most cleaning, and the Chem clean
is reserved for carbs, but at this point, I am dumping the Chem-Clean.  
Too dangerous.  

I don't know what I will replace it with.  I may just pass on cleaning
them or send them to a shop.  They usually wind up at a shop for throttle
shaft re-bushing these days anyway after the cleaning process.  Don't know
what I am saving, as they re-clean them anyway.
