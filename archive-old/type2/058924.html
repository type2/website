Subject: Bus Rear Seat

		I'm looking for a rear seat for my 71 bus.  I'm not exactly
sure how much it is going to run me, but I don't want to get took if I find
one and some guy wants to charge me more than I should be paying.  How do
you know if you're paying too much for a part?  Any suggestions would be
appreciated.
