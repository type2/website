Its Friday and I want to testify!  Thats right, I'm gonna testify here.

We in the bus community are quite lucky to have people like Jerry Jess
amongst us.  He provides a valuable service to many of us which is easy to
take for granted.  We've all seen his posts regarding busses available for
sale in &quot;Aridzona&quot;.  For the past 5 years, I've had a relative looking for
a clean, rust free bus which is nearly impossible to find here in the
midwest.  I'd been telling him that you gotta go south or west to get one.
About 5-6 weeks back I saw one of Jerry's posts of a '78 9 passenger bus
for sale in Pheonix, so I made the call.  The bus sounded nice enough and
the price sounded reasonable, but what can you tell over the phone?  I
contacted Jerry to see if he could inspect it for me and he agreed.  He did
it the same day even though he wasn't feeling well.  I got an accurate
evaluation of the condition of the bus and the relative went ahead with the
purchase.  We were also able to determine from Jerry's inspection that it
wasn't a good idea to try to drive it back to Indiana, due to some engine
uncertainties.  Well the bus arrived here by car carrier on Wednesday and
was pretty much what we expected, no surprises.  Though it was not in as
good of shape as the owner originally stated, it was rust free, straight,
in excellent condition and ran well.  I think we would have been in for a
surprise had we listened to the owner's description exclusively.  The
engine tin however was pretty hacked up and likely would have caused some
overheating problems if we had tried to drive it back.

Bottom line is that Jerry helped us find a bus and then saved us a lot of
hassle.  He may also have helped save another bus by finding it a new home
with an owner who knows busses and who will care for it and love it as is
appropriate.

Thanks Jerry!

Have a great weekend all,
