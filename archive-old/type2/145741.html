Subject: Re: [T2] No flame war please! Engine swap question.

high jeff i have some friends that just sold one of there bus's that they had for years that they put a 1600 or 1776 one i cant remember  in.....
  they  were pleased with it....
  i am sure the new owners will be pleased with it also...
  they make a fiberglass tin replacement you can buy for this very purpose or you can find the tin for it if you are very lcuky.

  Hi all,
Has anyone attempted an engine swap of this nature? Type 1 engine into a bus 
using a type 4 motor? I've heard that it can be done, just curious. I'm sure 
it would have to be a &quot;built&quot; type 1 to handle the load. Begin!
