That rec was for steel parts folks, and it does do wonders, you do NOT
want to do that to an aluminum case for sure, and I would imagine it
isn't a good idea on a T1 case though I don't know that for certain.
Hot TSP will cause discoloration and surface damage to aluminum
for sure.  Assuming a case that needs heavily degreased from the start,
I second the rec as I've mentioned many times in the past, take it to
someone.  Call local automobile machine shops and also tranny
rebuilders as if they have a pressure wash cabinet for their aluminum
heads or tranny cases (most do now days that the EPA killed off cold
dip tanks.)  Ask how much, local costs me $20 for a case or $20 for
a set of heads, comes out looking like the day they left the factory.
Comparison shop.  Some things just aren't worth doing yourself unless
you really have to do it yourself.

If the case just has machining residue but is mostly degreased you
can do a sufficient job just with spray on engine cleaner and a pressure
washer or car wash bay, then follow up with a good submerged wash
in a big basin of sudsy dish soap (I'm talking like Dawn here, NOT
dishwasher detergent which will do much what the TSP will.)  Blow it
off with air and then let it dry well (maybe low oven dry at 175F or so
if your SO will let you.)

John
