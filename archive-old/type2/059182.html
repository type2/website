Hello all-
A recent message posted on the bulletin board at my work caught my eye
** '74 VW Bus $600. Weird engine **

It's the 'weird engine' part that intrigued me.
I went and looked at it and decided that it was too much of a 
'Rube Goldberg' (compared to my '67) bus for me to want to fiddle with
it.
Things to know:
1) It doesn't run
2) It was converted to FI
3) It has a *almost* complete original interior 
-I say almost because it is missing rear cabinet but I'm not sure if
that was all it was missing-
4) Pop-top &amp; walkthrough 
5) Body in great shape/ floor pans clean w/ minimal(not an
exaggeration)  surface rust near jack points where undercoating has
flaked off(I didn't get to see under carpet in driver area, too much
stuff inside but she was cleaning it out so you might be able to get
better look-everywhere else looked good)
6) Orange outside/ Orange inside (w/ brown/orange check seats)
7) Seats (Z-bed,front &amp; pass) worn (tears in front seats, all flat)
8) Cabinets in good shape (but stickered), refrig works, all tables
accounted for
9) Interior paneling worn - incl. dash
10) Been parked for X # of years &amp; lived in 
11) Prev, PO was tinkering engineer &lt;affects 2,3,and 4&gt; 
12) You will very likely be towing this away

I'd love to give more mechanical info but current owner doesn't know
anything about it's ~possible~ working order (other than clutch work was
done about 5yrs ago &amp; it had to be taken to &quot;referee&quot; each time it
needed to be smogged -see #2&amp;10-) or any repairs/modifications -no
paperwork available. It is however, in overall great shape and if you've
got the mind to rewire and install new engine (possibly) it's a deal!
