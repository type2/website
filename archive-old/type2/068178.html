Subject: Re: Westy owners, where are your jalousie window handles?

Steven,
I have a &quot;box stock&quot; '72 Westy, non pop-top. My jalousy windows both have the
operator on the right side (reach thru the driver's window for the driver's
side, open the slider slightly for access to the passenger side via the crack at
the rear of the door. It is my belief that my Westy came this way, but I
wouldn't doubt the possibility of some &quot;leftovers&quot; (may have been there were
only a left and a right available in the Westy shop on the day your van was
made, and that's what got installed. 
FWIW, I have a '70 Campmobile dealer's brochure that shows the operator for the
driver's side on the left. I also have a '70 Campmobile Operating Instructions
book that appears to show the lack of an operator on the right side (can't see
the left side) making both windows left hand operated, exactly the opposite of
mine. I like the way mine is. I can't see having the operator on the left,
especially on the driver's side, since to open or close it you would have to get
in the rear of the van rather than reaching back from the driver's seat. 

Regards,
Andy McKinley

'72 Westy (Bessie)


&gt;As a point of minor curiousity, and because I have seen them in pretty
&gt;nearly every position, if you own a &quot;box stock&quot; Westy, where *should* they
&gt;be? If you don't, but have played with your window locations, is there a
&gt;favorite crank position?
