&gt;Your prayers may be answered.

Ooooohhhhhhh... now you've done it!  :)  I had no idea these were available.  It's not clear from their web page whether or not the stock hubcaps fit - they say the Vanagon hubcaps will not fit but I thought those were a direct swap for the bay ones?  I will call them as soon as they open to find out - I wouldn't want them unless the stock hubcaps fit.    

As for tire choices, they mention 215/65-15 as being commonly available (and isn't that the Eurovan size?).  I just spent 15 minutes on Tire Rack's web site and most tires in that size have a max load of 1510lbs.  In the ballpark but a hair under spec - right George?  :)  I checked the diameter of my current 27x8.5x14 tires and came up with 26.5&quot; and 782 revs/mile.  They fit my '73 just fine and I would like to maintain that diameter, at least in the rear.  The 215/65-15's are smaller at 26&quot; but 215/70-15 is 26.9&quot; diameter and also have a higher load rating of 1620lbs (Yokohama Aegis LS4 used as an example).  Or I could get the Continental LS 23 in the same size with a whopping 2271lbs in load range D!  Or, or...  

I need $350!
