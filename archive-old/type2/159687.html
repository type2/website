Subject: Re: [T2] VW Bus Junk Yard recycling

I have an inverter and it power my Sawzall plenty for cutting sheet 
metal at the junkyard but you'll need a well charged car battery so the 
low voltage alarm doesn't cut off the power. Also neither my 600W nor my 
800W (both have large surge capacity) will run my DeWalt grinder b/c of 
the large starting current required. I can start my Sawzall without any 
problem as well as any other tool that has variable speed control. I 
have to start them no-load. This setup has served me well. Clip the 
inverter right on to the battery and then use a standard orange hardware 
store battery. On one occasion I had to leave the inverter clipped to 
our Honda's battery with the engine idling so I could make a series of 
cuts. Fortunately I could get the car close enough to use a 15ft 
extension cord without troubles.
