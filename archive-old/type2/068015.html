Subject: Re: Fuel tank replacement problem

What year is the replacement tank?  I'm wondering if you are leaving off
the fuel filter, which IS an adapter from the small tank hose to
the large fuel pump hose?

I replaced the tank on my '81 with one from an '84.  The tube coming
off the tank to the fuel pump is identical to that on the '81.  
The fill tube on the '84 is plastic and smaller than the monstrous 
metal thing onthe '81.  Perhaps the gasket on the tank is the 
only difference there.  I liked the '84 one better and installed
it on my van.

&gt;I recently replaced the fuel tank on my 81 Vangon.  The tank the dealer gave
&gt;me is actually for later model vans.  Seemed to be the same, until I came to
&gt;the final step, hooking up the line to the fuel pump.  They increased the
&gt;size of the spout coming off the tank, so now it does not match the hose
&gt;going into the fuel pump.  VW used to have an adapter, according to the
&gt;dealer's parts guy, but it looks like they no longer stock it.
