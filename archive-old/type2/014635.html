Subject: Retractable Seatbelts for Buses (Genuine VW)
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

I'm importing 10 sets of retractable seatbelts from Mexico.  These were used
on buses made in Mexico in the 1980's  They will fit most bay window buses
with little modification.  You will need some longer bolts for your upper
shoulder mount, and I suggest some longer bolts as well for mounting the
retractable part behind your seat.   I may include some of these parts later
on in a kit, but for now you will need to buy your own.

I am offering these to the list members for $150.00 per set plus shipping from
St. Louis.  This includes seatbelts for both front seats!  I will be putting
these on my web pages soon for $200.  

I installed these in my '74 Campmobile and can't tell you enough how much I
love them.  They fit well, and I can now adjust the radio, or reach over and
open the passenger window without having to slip off the belt.  Best of all,
these are genuine VW parts.

The seatbelt conversion only takes about an hour to install.  You receive both
the left and right retractable hardware, and 2 seat belt receiving ends that
mount in the stock location.  The new buckle ends are made of heavy rubber
coated cable, and will want to lay on the floor when not in use.  I made a
little loop of cloth attached to the seat frame to hold them up next to my
seats.

P-mail me if interested.  I will be ordering more when these 10 are gone.

Thanks,
