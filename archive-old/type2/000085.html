Dear list,


- DIZZY -
Following a wild hair, I pulled my 009 out and replaced it with the dizzy 
that came with the bus (I think).  It sucks from one side only and I think it 
came from a SP engine (I have a 1600 DP, '71 Westy).  A brief test drive 
revealed no GLARING differences, but it does seem to have a little less pep.  
At least now I have two dizzies that are dialed in and ready to go.

- CARB -
I almost put on a spare carb I have, but then I thought, if it ain't broke, 
don't fix it.  (I should probably apply this same logic to the dizzy.)  The 
34 PICT 3 I have in there right now seems to work just fine except I can't 
get the idle down to the recommended 900 RPM.  It sits at about 1100 RPM with 
the idle adjustment screw (the larger, upper screw one the side) tightened 
all the way in.  The spare carb is a H31 PICT from Brazil.  The REAL dilemma 
is this . . . 

- ELECTRONS -
My cylinder head temp gauge quit.  Having lost this security blanket, I'm not 
sure I should muck around with things back there until I get that monitor 
back.  I tested the wires to the gauge by unplugging the sender and testing 
resistance across the two wires (in effect, testing continuity).  It's OK.   
How do I test the sender?  I suspect I just do the same with it first when 
the engine is cold, and then when it is hot.  I am presuming that this setup 
works on the principle of dissimilar metals, that is, when these metals (or 
whatever) get hot, they (it) generates a voltage that is registered by the 
gauge.  Can someone help me here?  There is now outside voltage coming into 
this circuit, so I don't see how the gauge could register current or 
resistance.  My question, I suppose, is this: besides telling me the 
temperature at the cylinder head stud just above the spark plug hole (that's 
where the sender is mounted), what is the gauge reading - V, I, or R?  

Now, supposin' I was to get a new sender.  It seems to me the best place to 
mount it (for accessibility's sake) is on one of the #3 exhaust port studs.  
Some modifications would need to be made because the end of the sender is 
designed to fit around a spark plug.  This could be accomplished with a pair 
of washers, perhaps trimmed on one side to fit that tight space.   Also, the 
stud may have to be longer, but again, this would make the sender more 
accessible (should it go south again).  I've grappled with this before, so I 
thought I would tap into the infinite wisdom of the list to see if there was 
a consensus out there.

On another note, I'm still waiting for my tranny.  I went ahead and pulled 
the engine to fix the main seal and the clutch (the disk was saturated and 
the flywheel was glazed), but I haven't heard from our esteemed trannymeister 
since I sent him $350 advance money 3 months ago.  Not a word.  Does not 
respond to E-mail or phone messages.  Anybody out there know the scoop?  The 
engine still needs some items of maintenance work (cleaning, new right heat 
exchanger, cylinder head temp sender, some new tin, new header, etc., etc., 
etc.).
