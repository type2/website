Subject: heater and fresh air fan

My first bus 73..  Bently schematic shows a heater fan and a fresh air fan.
I can only find the heater fan (single speed) connected to the heater boxes,
and hanging below  the dash I can only find a multi speed swith.  So where
is the switch for the heater fan? and where is the fresh air blower and what
would it connect to ( i mean air supply and discharge?  I have to get the
defroster to work for safety inspection.
