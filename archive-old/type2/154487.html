Subject: RE: [T2] Looking for an engine- AVP?

Greg,

I just picked up a NEW 1600 DP motor from NuVintage here in Arvada, CO. It
has worked out excellent. BUT since you don't have a local source...

I would check into Mid-America Motorworks. They have a variety of options
and excellent warranties. I think they are still offering the MexiMotor
which is desirable. They also have a dual-port/doghouse kit to upgrade your
cooling while you are at it.

I used MOFOCO for my high-performance 1914, but I hear their stock engines
leave something to be desired. If you are looking for a 1776 or higher, they
were excellent to work with.

GEX is out of the question and AVP has spotty quality.

Good luck.

Jon Stiles

I'm looking to put either a new or rebuilt engine in my 68' (my  
current engine is fully toast).  Since I don't have many local  
options (Annapolis, MD), I've been looking around for some options.   
Can anyone offer some thoughts on AVP?  Others I should consider?  I  
am fully aware of GEX, so that should cut down on some of the email :-)
