Subject: Make a Pilot Bearing Puller 

If you can't find the special puller, I made one based
on some ideas from the archives with some improvements
which worked well.  Total cost was $3.  

Parts Needed:
-1/4&quot;x4&quot; threaded bolt
-1/4&quot; square nut
-1/4&quot; nut sqare or hex
-1/4&quot; coupler (really long nut)
-1&quot; nut (or bigger), or a short section of 1&quot; pipe
-2 or 3 washers that will stop the coupler from
passing   through the 1&quot; nut.
-A Thick washer (or 2) just slightly smaller than
bearing O.D.

Grind or file the thick washer into an oval shape. 
Make it small enough so that while on the bolt, it
will just slip through the inside of the bearing (at
an angle).  Take the bolt, thread on the coupler, the
2 3 washers, the 1&quot; nut, the oval washer, the 1/4&quot;
square nut, and the 1/4&quot; nut in that order. 

Lock the two 1/4&quot; nuts near the end of the bolt, as
tight as you can.  Insert the washer assembly in
behind the bearing and toggle it so it is flat.  I
push it to one side to use more of the washer surface
even though it is not centered in the bearing. Center
the 1&quot; nut over the hole, spin the coupler down
against the washers, the washers against the nut, and
continue, pulling the bearing out. 

Some people wrote that they had trouble with similar
methods on stubborn bearings, so I tried to improve
the odds.  I use the square nut in the back because
it's bigger and gives more strength to the washer.  I
use a coupler, with antiseize, to do the pulling
because it gives you less chance of stripping than a
nut, I even hit the washer under the coupler with a
drop of oil just for fun.  The bolt head allows you to
keep it from spinning as you pull the bearing.

with Thanks to the archive contributors (don't recall
names)

Good Luck
