Subject: [T2] good buy on a great bus!

You may have known previously as David Wolf. I have
been off the list for a while as we are in transit to
live in Bulgaria (in 2 days).

I am leaving my bus with a friend in Santa Rosa CA to
sell... Here are the specs:

'76 Riviera pop-top. 13,000mi on a well rebuilt motor.
2.5 years on the auto trans rebuild. recent CV's,
front and rear brakes, tie rods, two new tires
(bridgestone603).

Green lower with Aztec and Mayan glyphs painted around
the pop-top.

The bad: needs torsion resetting and passenger side
control arm replaced due to accident, also passenger
door got whacked, but still works.

Drives great and has been a loving bus. $1800 (don't
ask how much I have into her).

Thanks

David Wolf
'76 Riviera
