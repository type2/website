&gt;You might try Pearl White # 1594 by Plasti-Kote.* Says on the can,  for
&gt;light trucks, sport utilities, and VANS*.  Pep Boys  $4.99 a can.   Don't
&gt;know if it will be a perfect match, but should be closer than the two 
&gt;that
&gt;you've tried.
========================&gt;
I'll give it a try.
Actually, the color does seem to match that of a fresh water pearl, now 
that I think about it. About the same color as the ones I used to buy 
on Hainan Island.
