The clip is pivoted at the lever for a reason.  Make sure that the clevis
is free to pivot on the lever so that the end of the cable doesn't get
twisted back and forth when it operates.  Have someone step on the clutch
while you watch below (wheels blocked!) for twisting.  The clevis must
stay in line with the cable throughout its stroke.
