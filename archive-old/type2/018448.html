Ok, I'm somewhat of a newbie that just bought his first bus, but has
learned a lot very quickly....through Muir, and hands on experience, and
the almighty list....
Hands on experience is definitely best and reccommended over any other
form of information.....get your hands dirty!

I'm having my bus towed to my house and am going to rebuild the engine
there and get it running....just to save the trip of 40+ miles per
day....its a big hassle...but yet worth it..

anyways...any tips for rebuilding a 1600 engine for the first time??
Its out of a 71 hardtop westy...
What should I do/shouldn't do??
I figured out my distributor today thanks to Muir and hands on experiene
(after traveling 20 miles ....then realizing that I forgot my
keys...having to travel back 20 miles...then 20 miles back to the
bus....around town looking for spark plugs...NOBODY stocks them...they
kept telling me to get resistor plugs and gave me an odd look when I
said I couldn't use them...and then having to travel back 20 miles to
home...)
anyways...what should I look out for?? is it hard to pull the engine??
Who's got experience?
