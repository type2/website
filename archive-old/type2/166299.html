Subject: Re: [T2] Del 40s fuel hookup

The fuel lines should be Tee'd together and attached to the output of 
the fuel pump.  You can cap off the two ports at the base plates since 
they are not needed with an 009.

&gt; the 2 fuel &quot;nipples&quot; on the Del 40s attach to the fuel system, and where the
&gt; &quot;base plate&quot; attachments go to since I am running an 009 &quot;dizzy&quot;.
