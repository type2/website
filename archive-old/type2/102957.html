You were told wrong.  A correctly-adjusted bus with the short mirror won't
show the horizon through the window through the rear-view mirror.

I found
this out the hard way when I decided to adjust mine.  I got a good view of
the road behind after lifting the rear end, but I also got nasty handling
and torn CV boots from excessive angles.

I then sat down with the Bently and adjusted the bars to spec.  My bus
sits dead level (measured on the cargo floor) with 170 pounds in the front
seat.  I still can't see the horizon.
