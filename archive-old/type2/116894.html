Subject: 71 clutch and seal replace

71 Bus. I plan to replace my clutch disk, O ring, and front seal soon, 
hopefully get another 30 K on an apparently healthy engine. I live in rural 
Minnesota, no VW flaps, so want to have the parts on hand for the pull. Are 
there any other parts to routinely replace while in there, assuming throwout 
bearing, pressure plate, etc look good?

In the Idiot Book, Muir talks about a gasket under the flywheel. On page 
267: &quot;Also note if the gasket under the flywheel is paper or metal so you 
know which kind to use when assembling&quot;, and 299: &quot;Check the gasket w the 4 
holes in it. It's in place? OK.&quot;
I can't locate this gasket w our usual vendors, is it generally reusable? 
Thoughts?

There are two replacement discs available, one described as rigid and one 
described as spring. I'd appreciate any guidance as to which is appropriate.

I plan to take the advice of the list and thoroughly seal the tin at this 
time. I see there are two ~2&quot; holes in the engine lid, under the license 
plate. I've never seen them mentioned here. Are they supposed to be open or 
plugged?

Thanks in advance for any help.
Best wishes
Denny Johnson
