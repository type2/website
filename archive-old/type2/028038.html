Subject: German Mechanical Fuel Pumps are Back!

For those of you who prefer the original-equipment mechanical fuel pumps on
your '72-74 (carbureted) bus...

For the last two years, affordable pumps have been unavailable, since the
$70 South American ones were discontinued, and German ones were just too
expensive at more than twice that price.

I just bought a dozen brand new original-equipment German made Pierburg
mechanical fuel pumps, from a distributor who discovered them forgotten on a
dusty shelf.  I don't think he realized how expensive they had gotten since
he'd put them there, as he sold them to be based on the cost he had paid at
that time.

So, they are $99.95 while they last. Part number 021 127 025A ; order
toll-free or via the website.  Once they're gone, it's back to around $150
for these babies. :-(
