Subject: Battery drain...
Date: Tue, 16 Feb 1999 21:56:51 -0700

Hello, all:
I've stumbled on a most frustrating problem.
My battery (78 westy) is new, as in bought three months ago from NAPA, but
persists in losing its charge after a week or so. I've pulled it and had it
tested *twice*, and it's checked out great both times. I also pulled the
alternator and had that tested, and it too has come up fine on a bench
test. So I replaced the regulator (grasping at straws after two months of
push starting and booster cables) with a brand new one.
Still, I'm drained.
:-/
Last week I went so far as to remove the F*rd solenoid/starter bypass unit
I installed several years back, since I replaced the shot starter/solenoid
assembly with a good, new one last year anyway.
I found a couple frayed and exposed wires there at the starter, which I
right away replaced as well -- thinking *they* might cause current drain or
somehow otherwise sap the battery's juice.
Still, no luck.
So my bus sits.
I've owned this van for five years, been to hell and back in it in fact,
and on the way I've fixed just about everything you can imagine. New engine
last summer, etc., etc., etc.
But by far, this battery-drain fiasco is the most frustrating situation
I've encountered. If anyone has any advice or insight whatsoever, please
p-mail me at hunter_at_rmci_dot_net. Or, better still, post your thoughts to the
list. That way, your help will be archived -- so the next time some poor
schmuck like me runs into such a problem, he or she can search the annals
of bus wisdom for an answer. I did so and found nothing. But I'll add this:
I have been able to fix many, many problems with the aid of those archives.
Invaluable.

Emotionally, physically and mentally DRAINED,
Not to mention sorely lacking transportation here in Idaho,
