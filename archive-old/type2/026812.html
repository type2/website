Hi folks,
   I've been helping a local 15 year old get a 74 bus road worthy as his 
first car.  He doesn't even have his drivers license yet, but hopes to soon.
   Anyway, I could use some help from you folks.  We/he needs the housing 
that goes around the steering column to hold the turn signal switch and head 
light dimmer switch.  Anybody have one?  Also,I'd like to be able to give 
him an owners manual for the 74 when we are all done.  Does anyone have one 
to spare or know where I might find one?
   That's for whatever help you might be able to send my/our way.
