Subject: Replacing sills

There was a question on the list about replacing lower sills (usa:
rockerpanels). I have an article on this subject on my site. It's written
for the complete beginner (which I was when I did that).

The belly pans are on some buses and not on some others. It looks like that
all buses with 'holes' in the roof have them for extra strength. At least
when the holes are factory created (pop-top or sliding whatsitcalled). Many
buses that are retrofitted with pop-tops don't have them. The panels create
an extra box-shape under the floor so stiffening the whole bus. They also
protect the cargo floor against  road-salt and grime however they can trap
water and dirt. So it's a mixed blessing.

You can safely remove the sills and outriggers. The bus won't fold in half.
The chassis members will take the strain. But I would do only one side at a
time but even that may be overcautious.
