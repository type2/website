Subject: FS - Aircooled Westy from Volkswagen Camper and Commercial

Issue 11, Summer 2003 of Volkswagen Camper and Commercial has 
a great shot of Pokey going through the S turn at Watkins 
Glen last summer (page 20). Thanks to Joel Court for the 
article and pics...

Pokey is still for sale, but if she doesn't sell shortly I am 
going to an auction site. You can view details at: 
www.vanagon_dot_org . Remember that is .ORG not .COM.

Thanks,
Chris
