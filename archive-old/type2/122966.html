Subject: Re: [T2] #$%&amp;_at_ Exhaust AGAIN!!

1. If there are holes in the head where the studs used to be, can I just
thread new studs in, or do I need to drill to 10mm and use the step-stud?

I have heard both pro's and con's to using them, but the list may decide that
Heli-coils would be a good option. They're quick and dirty but longevity may
be of concern. At least your head stud size will remain the same. Perhaps some
other members have taken this route...


2. I've never tapped threads into metal, let alone into the part of my car
that makes it go.  Which tools and methods are recommended?  What should I
avoid so I don't destroy my engine?

You've already got it. Keep it level and straight ^_^


3. If a weld on a heat exchanger flange is broken, can I get it welded, or
do I need a new heat exchanger?

This can be done, but take great care to ensure the flange is properly
aligned.
