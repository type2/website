&gt; All this recent talk about shifting problems and how the &quot;hockey stick
&gt; transmission bushing&quot; fixed the problem made me start to think that I
&gt; should replace mine.  So I put in the keyword of hockey stick
&gt; transmission bushing in several online venders and guess what, nothing
&gt; comes back as being found to that description.  I'm guessing Volkswagen
&gt; had another name or description for it.  If someone could be so kind to
&gt; let me know what VW calls it I would appreciate it.

Bus-boys_dot_com stock the better steel ones - some of them are plastic and
break easily. Just ask for the hockey-stick bushing and they will know.
