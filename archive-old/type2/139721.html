Subject: Re: [T2] Don't forget to order clutch alignment tool!

Tom,

Before I had 15 of the durn plastic ones laying all around, I used to use 
a socket that &quot;just&quot; fit to set it up.  I'm sure that other folks will 
chime in on this too.

You *don't* have to have the $22.00 tool.....

You can always eyeball it to make sure it is centered before you torque it 
down.

Cheers, dave

snipped
&gt; 
&gt; The moral of the story is, Make a list and check it twice. Then check it again
&gt; befor ordering parts for your rebuilt engine, lest you spend 3 hours trying to
&gt; find that little detail you forgot.
&gt; 
&gt; Venting over. Back to installing my engine.
