&gt; Can anyone recommend a good garage or mechanic in the South west of 
&gt;  England? The 1600cc engine in my 1972 bus ceased after the oil 
&gt;  drained out and wasn't topped up whilst my partner took it on a 'long 
&gt;  run' last summer
&gt;  
&gt;  Over the winter I have managed to free the engine but now it sounds 
&gt;  like a bag of spanners and is very, very low on power - I have 
&gt;  trouble moving it across my gravelled car park and up a curb.
&gt;  
&gt;  I have no real technical knowledge of vans or engines and have just 
&gt;  heard horror storys about the local camper van 'specailist'.
&gt;  
&gt;  Should I attempt to fix it or look for another engine?
&gt;  
&gt;  Does anyone want to sell me a 1600cc engine - cheap?

Hi Archie,

The VW specialist garage which I've used for 10 years is Continental Spares 
at 435 Wells Road Bristol 0117-9776544. They are a family firm that go back 
with air cooled VWs for the best part of 50 years.

However it does sound rather like you need a complete replacement engine. You 
could get a cheep re conditioned engine from Volkspares (I have heard of 
people who were not satisfied with these engines, but also others who were 
happy), a new VEGE engine from Just Kampers (and others) or go the whole hog 
and get a new 64bph 1600 FI engine from Beetles UK.

Good luck
