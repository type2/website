Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for Alternator Conversion Kit for 71 Westy

The conversion kit consists of the three pieces of tin that bolt to the
front of the alternator, and the alternator stand.  The alternator is a
standard internal regulator alternator.  If you have the (dished) bus tin
on your bus you will also need a stock 30A generator fan hub.

You're better off getting the tin and stand used rather than buying the
&quot;kit&quot;.  Fit will be better and the tin is much thicker.

The only other thing in the kit will be a set of wiring instructions,
which you can get from the group when you need them.
