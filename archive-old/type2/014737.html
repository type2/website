X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Well this weekend was a good weekend to work on my upright convertion. As
many know I am replacing my blown up 1600dp with a 1.8l type 4 in my 71
Westy. I have been following most of the instructions in Joe Calis book, but
have also deviated some. I cut two upper cylinder covers, and welded them
together to make the right side upper tin. This went very well, but I still
have some work to go. I took the blower hub off and turned it down to fit
inside the stock type 1 pulley. This is the opposite of Joes method. He has
you ream out the inside of the pulley to fit the hub, I turned down the hub.
I also had to cut off some of the pulleys treaded oil return grove. The
alternator stand is a big part of the convertion and the key to it all. He
suggests that you make it out of a 1/2in plate of aluminum. I did not have
any, so I used a 1/2in steel plate. I then cut down the stock Alt mount for
the type 1 and bolted it to the plate. This worked out much better, it
allows me to make fine adjustments if needed. 
  One of the main complaints I have heard about the convertion is that the
rear tin does not look factory, it looks out of place. he takes a flate
peice of aluminum sheet and welds on a box to enclose the pulley. I did not
like this. I had already cut off all the mounts for the type 4 fan, so I
found the type 1/2 peice of tin that goes under the pulley(mounts to the
block) and cut and trimed it to fit snug to the block. Now I can trim the
breast tin to mate up and it should look almost factory. 
  My goal in this is to have a type 4 engine in the Bus that will look like
the factory put it there. I am using all original factory tin if possible
and modifing it to fit. One thing I realy like about the Cali convertion is
that you get to keep the original type 1 flaps. 
   I know many do not understand why I am doing this, if you do not please
leave me in peace, I am doing it for me, I want to. I know there are other
ways to make power, this is my choice. I enjoy a chalenge and working on
something that will be unique to me. 
  I will be getting pictures of this soon and will post them to my web
page(sorely out dated). If you are interested in the same type of convertion
let me know. We can share what we have learned.
