Hi (again)

I have the gas tank out of polly. The rubber filler neck seems OK but =
the next piece of rubber- an elbow which fits onto the tank is perished. =
 Anyone know where I can source one?  Will a junk yard one be as bad?  =
Why all he bends, is this just to put the filler cap behind the sliding =
door?

Thanks
