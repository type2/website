Subject: Re: [T2] 1977 T2 engine longevity

Hello Jeff,

I am not familiar with the details of the 82 Vanagon setup but it sounds 
like you are in the same hole as I find myself. Being in so deep I continue 
to dig.

Refitting with a Lambda control from a later Cal bus has crossed my mind. 
Lambda control would hold the CO content at the cat converter input at 0.5% 
to 0.8%. But running at these levels without EGR is risky and running with 
EGR is messy. Also when the EGR clogs without warning you are high and dry.

What also can happen is one cylinder running much leaner than the other 
three (keep an eye on your spark plugs). The Lambda sensor samples the 
average of the combined four cylinders CO output. All it takes is one piston 
blowing to ruin your day.

Actually the fact that you a getting low gas mileage may mean you are 
running at a safer high CO content. I don't monitor my gas mileage but it 
probably is poor. On the other hand my plugs don't show signs of an over 
rich condition and the the engine runs briskly through the gears.

You may want to invest in a CO meter and watch the CO level into the cat 
converter closely. I have one (e-bay $130) and tune all my old cars with it.

As to the dwell. Most older type rev limiters work by abruptly killing the 
spark. Backing off the dwell reduces the the coil's ability to deliver high 
voltage at high revs. Short dwell is not harmful to any of the ignition 
components that I know of. This effect increases as the RPM increases so it 
is not so abrupt. Back it off until you note a loss of high rev performance 
you can't live with. I like 38 degrees. The T2 is not a 914 but even some 
914s have rev limiting. If you must have stock performance stick with 50 
degree dwell.

Keep digging
Chuck
