&gt; The nipple facing forward has the line running to the carb.  The fuel

&gt; nipples (I'm assuming that the nipples are actually attached to the bottom
&gt; of the fuel tank).

Yes, that is the bottom of the tank you can see.

Since your bus used to be fuel injected this plugged line used to connect to
the fuel pressure regulator by the 1/2 fuel rail.
 
&gt; Okay.  From what I've read here, the problem is probably the seal between
&gt; the metal fuel filler pipe and where it attaches to the tank.  Sound right?

The nipples are part of the tank:

If you can't see it's wet where the hose attaches then you've got a leak
somewhere inside the tank bay. It could be the breather hoses when you
overfill, or the rubber hose that connects the fuel filler pipe to the tank
opening. I doubt it's coming from the top where the sender is.

&gt; BTW, I carefully drove the bus home from the gas station without a disaster
&gt; occurring (we prayed!)  While there was some fuel fumes after turning or
&gt; getting over a sharp incline, we could not see any liquid fuel escaping
&gt; whenever we stopped to check.

Solve the problem asap.
