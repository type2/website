Subject: '79 fuel gauge
To: type2_at_bigkitty.azaccess_dot_com (IPM Return Requested)
Message-Id: &lt;&quot;981014193327Z.WT15716. 48*/PN=Brian.S.Hoare/OU=C367320/OU=SLLN/O=McDonnell Douglas/PRMD=MDC/ADMD=TELEMAIL/C=US/&quot;_at_MHS&gt;

My fuel gauge seems to be miscalibrated. When my tank is full it
only reads 3/4 full. Is there a way to adjust the gauge so that a full
tank reads full? (Like you adjust the tare on a bathroom scale).

One of the POs has obviously replaced the sender in the tank.
Unfortunately, this was done the quick and dirty way by cutting
a hole above the fuel tank to gain access to the sender. Could
an incorrect sender cause this problem? (such as a 68-73).
