Subject: Auto Paint at G.I.Joes. How bad is it? 

Hey hey, looks like I'm gonna be painting the bus at least once this
year. The first time or two is gonna be for practice, so I'm looking for
some super cheapola paint to spray on to have a better looking bus for
maybe 1 year. Then I'm gonna sand it back off the next year and re-paint
it. I wanna get REALLY good at spraying before I put on expensive paint,
not to mention that I have SOOooo many ideas on themes for the bus, I
don't want the paint to be a HUGE investment. 
 
On that note, I saw gallons of automotive paint at G.I.Joes for under
forty bucks! Now of course at that price it aint gonna stay on for long
I would imagine, and it probably fades pretty fast. But has anyone ever
tried that paint, or any other brand of ULTRA cheap paint? Does it LOOK
ok if applied well? I'm only looking for it last for 1 year. I'm sure
it's able to do THAT. I live in seattle where most of the year it's not
even sunny. Not even remotely. :) 
 
Ok, now this is different. I've heard you can get car insurance on
yourself. It gives you minimum liability insurance no matter what
vehicle your driving. Anybody know what this is called? And/or about how
much more expensive it is? I'de be happy with a 'Not much more' or 'Tons
more' type of answer here. :) 
 
 
Cheers
