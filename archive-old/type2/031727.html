&gt; My '72 Westy is currently sitting on  205/70R14's.  I heard (possibly

not true

&gt; before making a major purchase such as tires and don't want to waste
&gt; this time pricing the wrong tires.  Whether this is true or not, should
&gt; I replace my tires with the same size tires and will switching to a
&gt; smaller tire increase speed/power?

yes and no.  larger tire higher speed but lower power, smaller tire
(diameter not width) more power lower speed...however between 185 and 205
the difference is not detectable by the seat of your pants it is so small
