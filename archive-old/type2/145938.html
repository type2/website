&gt; What ever happened to the original VW concept of keeping it simple and
&gt; targeting it to the common man/woman.  I think VW has forgotten that
&gt; Volkswagen means peoples-automobile.  I mean, after all, Hitler himself
&gt; in 1933 directed Porshe to create a small, four-seater, with durable
&gt; engine, at least 40 miles to the gallon, air-cooled, with a low price
&gt; (then below 1,000 marks).
&gt;

    BTW, the &quot;original&quot; VW concept was the Tatra T97...Unfortunately,
it took 'til 1967 for Tatra to get a court settlement... ;-(
