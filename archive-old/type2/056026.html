Subject: Re: 200k possible?

Well, my original 78 has 194 K miles on it- and I know of another that went
to 204K and still runs, (the one I pulled out of a parter; found orig.
owner and he said it was only maintained...).  I know of another that
wobbled a rod bearing at 206K...so it is possible!  I'd go by compression
check and oil pressure......MB
