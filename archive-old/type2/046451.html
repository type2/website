Subject: RE: [T2] are  Type 4 bus + 914 fltwheels + clutches the same 

&gt;I have a 914 engine to put in my 72 Camper which does not have a motor 
&gt;at all will the 914 flywheel and clutch match-up to the bus throw out 
&gt;bearing and starter?

No, you need to use a bus flywheel, clutch, and TO bearing.  When you change 
flywheels, you'll need to check/reset your endplay.

Other considerations are sheet metal, rear motor mounts, pilot bearing, 
dipstick and oil fill.  

The motor mounts for 914's are shaped different than the bus ones.  Not 
interchangeable in any way, shape, or form.  You must have bus ones.

914's have a pilot bearing pressed into the flywheel.  Buses have them pressed 
into the end of the crankshaft.  Make certain you have a pilot bearing in your 
crankshaft!

My solution on the dipstick was to shorten the dipstick tube and the dipstick 
by about 1.5 inches.  That way I can remove it without hitting the top of the 
engine compartment.  The problem with this solution is you have to feel for the 
tube when you put the stick back in (Ouch! on a hot engine).

The 74 (73?) and newer 914 motors have a different breater box on top of the 
case.  One which has a screw-on oil filler cap.  Makes filling a lot easier 
since you don't have to pop the bail off every time.  You'll also need to cover 
up the hole in the sheetmetal that the bus oil filler tube used to go through.  
I used fiberglass.  Foil tape might work too.

If you're installing a 2.0 914 motor with correct 914 2.0 heads, you'll have 
some more sheetmetal work to do since the location of the sparkplugs is 
different on the 2.0 914 heads (three-bolt intakes).  I used a 1.5&quot; keyhole saw 
to cut the appropriate holes then used fiberglass to cover the old holes.  
Other than that, all bus sheet metal should fit the 914 motor just fine.

That's all I can think of right now.  Good luck.
