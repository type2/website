My door decal says 33 Front, 40 Rear for inflation. GVW 5093 Lbs. Vehicle
shipped Incomplete
I know it doesn't weigh near that. More like 3700 with all my gear.
I've checked the inflation and they say 44PSI Max Inflation.
You've convinced me.
Next time a pair of tires fail I'll upgrade under the warranty.
Can anybody out there come up with a proper Michlein tire number that's
going to be correct?
Recently they've changed some tire sizes and it's gotten rather
confusing.
NO! I would not consider changing brands. 
 You said &quot;Max inflation on the correct bus tires should read around 50
or 55 
 lbs.  With &quot;
