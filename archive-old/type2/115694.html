Subject: Re: [T2] timing and dwell

&gt; Someone replaced my ignition points.  I checked the dwell and it was 55.  I
&gt; checked the timing and it was about 11 vice 7.5

&gt; 
&gt; I reset the points to a dwell of 47, and the timing went from 11 to 14
&gt; 
&gt; Does this sound right??  I thought the timing would drop back to 7.5 if I
&gt; opened the points up.

The points always open every 90 degrees. The dwell is the amount of the time
that the coil gets to build a charge (points &quot;closed&quot;).

A smaller dwell means a bigger gap. A bigger gap means the charge time is
shorter and the spark can fire earlier. That's why the timing advanced.

BTW, I've experimented with a lot of dwell settings in the past, sometimes
involuntarily, and I have to agree with Steve Dolan that 50 degrees is the
best setting.

47-53 good
49-51 better
50 best
