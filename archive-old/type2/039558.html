 By half shaft I mean the shaft with the two CV joints

Not sure if the shaft lengths changed at any time or when. They might be
the same from 72 to 83. The CV's are the same throughout the Vanagon
production. Just measure center to center of your CV's in situ and compare
to any likely candidate. + or - 5 mm would not likely cause any problems.
Note that the length with the weight on the wheels will be shorter than if
jacked up with the suspension hanging. Be sure to compare apples to apples
in that regard.
