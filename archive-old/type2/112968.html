Subject: RE: [T2] R: [T2] Trash into oil

 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Honda has done some great things in this area...&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

My sister just bought a Civic Hybrid, she as 2 young children, she care 
about the future!!! She didn't care about lower power and the extra 
money that the hybrid cost compare to the already very economical Civic. 
Why does other company (mostly American I have to say) care about doing 
some economical and environment friendly car and truck. Europe and Asia 
produce small economical car, why not here, don't tell me America is too 
big and we need big car because we have to travel greater distance...

She is (and i am too) mad when she see guys driving &quot;ALONE&quot; big V8 SUV, 
it seem to me that in the 80' we tried to go economical &amp; and ecological 
(by force I have to say!), where is that era gone, all is back to normal 
now with our big car, truck, and SUV.  V10 are at our door.

II went from Montreal to Mexico in a 4cyl Bus at 55mph with 30bhp (he 
he), am not dead, it just took more time, time to enjoy the countryside.

Yea, we will all be dead in 50 years or so, why should we care for 
others in the future!!!!!

I drive a 99 Civic SI with 132bhp, I do 300mile with a full tank, power 
is more than enough, it's basically faster and quicker than most V6. Why 
would I need a bigger engine for personal transportation???? I would 
gladly buy an American car with the same feature and RELIABILITY; I even 
think the Ford Focus will meet those standard one day.

Have a good weekend
Cheers, Ben
