Subject: Re: [T2] Overheating VW Engines

Gentlepersons-
                       Enquiring minds want to know...Anybody out there have 
real figures on
the longevity of the various engine-bus combinations when new? Anybody with 
reviews
from contemporary sources? Not...My uncle had one new and etc...Some more 
objective
results than hearsay stories. I realize that this group might be skewed as a 
study, but
perhaps there are some collections of literature out there with results to 
compare.
