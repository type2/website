So what can you suggest to people (like me) who need to replace rubber
seals?  My bus is an Arizona car, so the rubber is pretty dried out and
cracked.  I was planning on replacing all of the rubber when I repaint it
(soon I hope).

If you use repro seals, when you open or close the windows, push on the
FRAME, not the glass.  In a year or so, it'll be okay .   (I know that isn't
very satisfactory).    The other option is go to brasil.  Let's make an epic
voyage in our buses, like the Inuvikers did.    Does anyone speak Portuguese?
    How far is that from Oly, WA?   Hey, I like this idea.  Okay, Get yer
passports and ditch your dope.

&gt; &gt; that peeople have actually broken windows attempting to shut
&gt; &gt; them (push on the outside of the window ina n attempt to
&gt; &gt; shut it and crack :(   )
