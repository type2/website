Subject: Vacuum leak stop ideas/solutions?

Hello Folks,

	Hi again! The problem, vacuum leak at cylinder head and intake
manifold, possibly an injector seal. This was verified by shooting some
starting fluid around that area. My shots could be more precise, however.
My first attempt at fixing this leak got me new big end and small seals for
the injectors. I pulled the intake manifold off to discover that the gasket
was no longer flat on the head side. There were indents present. I didn't
look at the heads to confirm any unevenness. I then applied hi-temp RTV and
retightened the bolts.

	The leak is still there. Any suggestions on products or techniques
I could use?

Thanks,	Craig in Seattle w/81 two Liter FI
