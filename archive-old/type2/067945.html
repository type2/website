&gt; help, mailing list please

I am gonna try an' interprut whatchu want from the a' buv mess-ig.

I think you are saying,&quot; help, I am on this list and I cant get off&quot;
or you are saying, &quot;help, 90 messages in 22 hours, that's TOOO Much and I 
need to subscribe to the digest format&quot;

Either, if that is what you want, here is how you do it.

First, mail to this address:

     Majordomo_at_primenet_dot_com

2nd, Majordomo is a computer program so you do not need to put anything in 
the subject line (majordomo is not easily amused or easily confused ;)

NExt, in the body of the message, if you want to unsubscribe put this:


     unsubscribe type2 &lt;your Email address here&gt;



OR, if you want to subscribe to the digest, put this in the body of the msg:

     subscribe type2-digest &lt;your Email address here&gt;
 

Do NOT include the '&lt;' '&gt;' brackets around your Email name and I am 
pretty sure that you need the hyphen ('-') between type2 and digest. 
Maybe not, I forget, try it both ways, hey man Im not perfect so lay off 
AT least I helped you out this much

Ciao good luck Bon Chance Buona Suerte Etc

PS two more things MR IMPERFECT forgot to mention, NO signatures in your 
message such as I have below this message. Majordomo hates that. Also if 
you just want help, send this in the body of the message

Help majordomo &lt;address here?&gt;

I forget if you need your address, try it both ways again
