Subject: Re: '73 auto - Heater blower and red (alt) light glow

Dear List:

Since it's Friday I'll answer my own post.  8^)

The Mystery Solved:

A marginal battery that apparently began draining when the extra load of the
heater blower was added.  Switched for my reserve battery and &quot;no more
glow.&quot;

Thanks to all who p-mailed me.
