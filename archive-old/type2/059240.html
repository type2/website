&gt;I have the opprotunity to buy, very cheaply, a 1974 bus that was
&gt;converted to a poptop camper by Safare in Hayward, Ca. I searched the
&gt;archives but can't find anything on a poptop Safare camper. The back 2/3
&gt;of the top pops straight up and has four tent sides with windows on
&gt;three sides. There's a full size bed up there and one folds down in the
&gt;back. This camper has an electric refrig and a propane stove behind the
&gt;front passenger seat and a sink and closets behind the driver. There's a
&gt;dinette where the back seat normally is with the seats on each side
&gt;facing in. All of the camper part of the interior is in pretty good
&gt;shape, the bus itself has been sitting for almost nine ! years and I
&gt;fear the worst for the entire driveline. The body is fair with some rust
&gt;on the front by the windshield and a couple minor dings in the side. Is
&gt;this beast worth saving? I have never owned a pancake engine before and
&gt;am kind of leery of tackling this one.I'd love to hear any suggestions

Wow, a poptop Safare.  I've never seen one in the flesh.  This is probably
one of the rarest busses in the U.S..  I have seen maybe a dozen Safare
campers in all the years I've been paying attention to VWs, and of course I
own one of those dozen (the first one I ever came into contact with), but
all of them have been highroofs.

I have a Safare owner's manual on the web, check out

http://www.tiu_dot_net/~des/vw/bluto/manual/

I think it mentions the pop top version in the manual, but all of the
pictures are of the highroof, which I think made up almost all of Safare's
production.  How do you know they were in Hayward?  My manual says they
were in Paramount, near Los Angeles, but I couldn't find any trace of them
there a couple of years ago when I was passing through.

If you decide not to buy this bus, please pass the information on to the
list, or to me personally.  Thanks,

-David
