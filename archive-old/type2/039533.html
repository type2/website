&gt; available. 

the easiest and possibly the easiest to find would be the FI system out of
the 71-74 VW 411/412  the engines are almost identical and the parts are
bolt fit...make sure you get all the parts and if possible get two sets of
parts...of course the best system would be to get a set from someone
converting to carbs...might work out a swap of parts
