The part number is 113 955 453B. Anyone have one in their pile?

One listee had an NOS earlier model. I have another listee offering to look
for used, but would really like a new one if possible.

Thanks,

&gt; My dentist has one of those, too.
&gt; One nice thing about dealing with VW's is that EVERY part has a part
number on
&gt; it.
&gt; Get the number; post it to this or the vintage list.
