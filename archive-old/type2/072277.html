Subject: Re: [T2] Electric Heat?

If you use a portable heater like the Mr. Bubby (I have one too for
backup), be sure to crack your window, it will tell you that in the
directions.

BTW, we just found out that the small portable propane tanks for some
reason don't work well at altitude.  Some friends of mine were trying to
use theirs at a campout we went to in Colorado and couldn't keep the pilot
lit.  We were at about 8,000 feet.


&gt;Last winter when the front heater motor fried in My 85 GL, I purchased a
&gt;&quot;Portable Buddy Heater&quot;, at Ace is the place which uses disposable
&gt;propane cylinder's.
&gt;I also use it in my Westy, and I have a hook-up to the propane tank l
&gt;aready have in the bus.
&gt;
&gt;Works out real nice, plenty of heat, simple, and portable.
&gt;
&gt;Cost?
&gt;
&gt;$99.00 ---a cheap, not complicated, heat solution.
