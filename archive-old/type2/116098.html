&gt; Now, my question is, where does
&gt; should this lose wire go? I can run a length of wire

The lose wire leaves the gas tank compartment and meets with a plastic
insulating connector. From there it goes up to the front and connects behind
the dash at the gas gauge.

&gt; I looked in the archives but couldn't find the answer,
&gt; Bently and Muir speak of a fuse. So does this wire go
&gt; to the fuse box? and where to from there? Help.
&gt; BTW this is a '73 bus.

It's in the library:
