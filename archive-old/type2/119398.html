Subject: Re: [T2] News Article...

There supposedly is a suspect that was a transient from that area who
happend to murder another woman in Cali, that was ALSO from Arkansas, so
maybe they have the guy. I haven't heard much else, they did bring up
Kristen though, so he is a suspect.
I hope DNA evidence is sufficent to prove something, at ther least for
the family and safety of others.
On that note:

We sleep at rest stops when we have to. I hate it, but I park by all the
damn idling Rigs and catch a few hours, then keep on going. The shepard
is a decent security system though, as long as everyone is locked in the
bus. I still always try and find a close KOA for a one night pop in
amougst the huge RVs instead, if I can.


&gt; I thought that they had captured someone in California that had
&gt; admitted to the murder...
