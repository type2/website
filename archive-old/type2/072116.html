I want to thank Teri, Jamie Rivers and Michael Benthin for their
information which was very helpful in figuring out which awning to purchase
for my '76 westy.

Below is my list of pros and cons of each awning that I looked at.

Sunsail Awnings from Euro Campers - http://www.eurocampers_dot_com/Sunsail.html
Good - Very nice looking, low cost, light wieght, good quality for the money.
Bad - Takes time to set up, no storage, must be stored in bus

Shady Boy awnings -
http://www.shadyboy_dot_com/vans/index.html
Good - Very neat design, nice box to attach to gutter for storage
Bad - Takes time to set up, uses fiberglass rods like a dome tent.

Freedom II from Care Free of Colorado -
http://www_dot_carefreeofcolorado_dot_com/7_Motorhomes.html
Good - Hands down the slickest awning, uses a crank, can set any distance
out so at shows or in close quarters, you can still use your awning.
Bad - Most expensive ($700).

Pro 35 from Fiamma -
http://www.fiamma.it/usa/prod_usa/usa-awnings/f35/default.htm
Good - light weight, nice color selection, mounts to drip rail with
adapters, legs fold up into box, nice box for storage, medium ($400) price.
Bad - only extends 7'5&quot;.

Catalina 2500 made by A&amp;E, purchased from Camping World -
http://www_dot_campingworld_dot_com/shop/products/index.cfm?type=category&amp;categoryID=6,5
51
Good - light weight, good choice of colors, mounts to drip rail with no
drilling using adapters, telescoping action opens to any distance, legs
fold into storage box, aluminum box for storage, medium price ($400).
Bad - needs to be tied down in wind.


Conclusion:
I was looking for an awning that would store in it's own box for ease of
packing.  I also wanted to mount the box to the bus without drilling any
holes.  Further, if in a tight spot, I wanted to be able to pull the awning
out a short distance and still be able to use it.

Maybe I'm getting old, but I really didn't want to have extra set up time,
I have done my share of tents, that's why I like the westy!!

Michael Benthin sent me some pictures of a Catalina on his bus and gave it
a good report.  Even though the price is more than I wanted to pay and I
couldn't get a yellow one to match the bus, I ordered a Catalina 2500 from
Camping World and it should be here in time for camping season!
