Here's a nice CE Westy that's for sale in Pennsylvania (off list
seller):

S N I P

I live in Pennsylvania. The van is brown and white with
brown,  green, and tan plaid interior and has chrome bumpers. It has
120,000 miles. It's  a deluxe westy it has all belongings except the back
table. This van is a rust  free VW, and is in very good condition. It is
presently used as a daily driver  and is well taking care of. I had the
van apraised at $ 4900.00 and I beleave  it's well worth every cent.
E-mail me and let me know. THANKS, Jason

No affiliation, YMMV, caveat emptor, etc. BUT--this is Westy that won the
best of the type award in voting last year.  Hope someone gets her...
