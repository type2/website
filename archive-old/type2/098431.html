&gt; To continue this topic, I am about to install either one or both new CV

&gt; (yet) giving me any trouble. I have ordered two *new* axles with CV joints
&gt; already installed. Should I swap both axles out or just replace the offending
&gt; side (and carry the new one as a spare)?

I don't think that you should swap out the good axle.  Life of CV joints
varies widely, and the failure of one does not mean the others will fail.
I recently replaced an original joint on my '71 which went 270,000 miles
and was still quiet even though it was galling badly.  I just watch the
boots, and when one goes bad inspect the CVs while replacing the boots.
Of course, this doesn't work well with the &quot;replace the whole axle&quot;
philosophy, so you'll have to take your own path.
