Subject: Re: Vanagon Connection - Fast German Auto

&gt; When I went to Fast German with an oil leak problem they
&gt; just shook their heads and chuckled and said that I should
&gt; know that all air cooled engines leak oil.

That's just plain terrible. And unfortunately, it's the norm...

&gt; I suggest going to http://www.markstephenshp_dot_com
&gt; The 2.4L is the best for your bus. Powerful yet very reliable.
&gt; And it won't leak oil. Any problems... he will fix them at cost.

Mmmh, you sound like a MSHP business partner... The archives aren't quite as
flattering regarding customer service and I don't think the 2.4L is the
&quot;best for your bus&quot; if it's fuel-injected and you're not ready to invest
into re-engineering the FI.

Please forgive my skepticism.

Sami
