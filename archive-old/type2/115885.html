Subject: Re: [T2] How do you set up your camp?

Mike, I read you're post about the &quot;cast&quot; trailer and it seems like a pretty
involved project.  I pull a Scamp trailer with my '76 westy and have pulled
it over 20,000 miles now.  The Scamps are fiberglass, weigh just a little
more than a Puck trailer and are molded or cast in a fiberglass mold.

I have a 2 burner propane stove, forced air furnace, hot and cold running
water, full sized shower, airconditioning, porta potti, 3 way 'fridge,
closet, many storage cabinets, with a dinnette and sleeping for 4.

You can purchase these older &quot;cast trailers&quot; pretty cheap, then fix them up
the way you want.  Many on this list pull fiberglass trailers, it is a great
way to enjoy both the bus and have a nice trailer to camp in.

&gt;&gt; ... well i like the idea of the trailer myself...
&gt; 
&gt; Did no one notice my custom trailer post shortly after midnight this
&gt; morning? :O)
