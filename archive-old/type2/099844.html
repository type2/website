Subject: Canadian HEI/CDI/Points Replacement Thingie

	All Knowing List:

	Has the person who was p*mping these puppies to the List via *-b*y
last week or so got theirs installed yet?  I was intrigued by the price
(85US$ - don't know CDN) as it would take the place of a $50-60 points
replacement kit AND add a HEI/CDI type spark-thrower (Universal's late
lamented units were over $100ish, depending on options).  It was a
&quot;buy-it-now&quot; price, seller still had 10 when I checked, so I thought &quot;what
the h*ck!&quot;, and fired off an order for one.

	I got mine in the mail the other day (Thanks, Pat-in-Montreal!), and
d*ng if it isn't the cutest little thang - the control box is about the
2/3rds (US) the size of a pack of &quot;coffin-nails&quot;, all sealed up in epoxy,
(maybe completely solid-state?), with a gold-anodized heat sink.
Instructions say it's supposed to be mounted over the coil with the
handy-dandy spring clip doohickey.  The only thing about it that would be a
down-side compared to the Universal box, is that there is no reversable plug
should it take a powder on you.  IIRC the manufacturer is Porter something
or other out of Vancouver, B.C.  I've got nothing to install this thing on
and test it out, as all my air-twirlers already have Comp-u-fires 'n
Universal CDIs installed.  Any of our friends north of the line got the 411
on Porter?  Anyone?  Anyone?
