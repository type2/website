Subject: [T2] Listees near Albany, NY???

Hey now...

Are there are listees in the Albany, NY area? My nephew,
who lives in Ohio, is very interested in buying a bus in the
Albany area, but needs some local help. It may not come
to pass,  but at this stage he wants to see if it is feasible. If
you are in the area and would be willing to help him get his
first bus,  please let him or me know. His email address is
jeffling_at_bright_dot_net.

Thanks...
