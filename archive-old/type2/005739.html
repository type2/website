Subject: Broken Dipstick Tube.... Help!
Date: Sun, 7 Feb 1999 17:01:43 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Fellow Busser's,

    Somehow I managed to partially break my oil dipstick tube, right where
it comes out of the engine tin.  It's almost broken completely through, and
covering everything with oil when I run it. At least I hope that's where all
this oil is coming from!
    How do I replace/fix this?  Is this piece pressed into the engine?
Screwed in?  Are there replacements available?
    I'd appreciate any help in getting my '72 Riviera daily driver suitable
to pack my family of five around in again!   Thanks!

-Brad in Oregon
