Subject: pilot bearing in crank-how to remove?
References: &lt;20010404.201251.-164617.0.wilden1_at_juno_dot_com&gt; &lt;3ACBD27C.C44115D2_at_prodigy_dot_net&gt;


Still cleaning and working on the high milage 78 Westy engine with a
failed clutch disk- removed the flywheel and noticed it's pretty
oily/gunked up behind it- mail seal leak?  Missing O-ring in flywheel
(it was)?  I'd like the remove the old pilot bearing, but it is not in
the flywheel like the archives say, it's in the crankshaft.
No puller at local flaps, but I got a lifter puller I may try.  Now I
read about the hydraulic method of stuffing the bearing cavity with oily
tissue paper or grease and then using a pounded trans shaft end or
suitable bolt to force out the bearing.  My worry is what this pounding
can do to the crankshaft journals- is this concern warranted??
any ideas for a puller?
