Subject: heater cables pics

I am looking for close up pics of the heater control flaps where the cables
attach to them. I need to get my cable to move the flaps correctly instead of
having them wired open. I think the mechanism that controls the flaps has been
modified by the PO. I looked the part up on the microfiche online, but I
cannot see it close enough to understand if mine has been modified.

Anyone have a picture of the cable attached to the flaps or just the pieces
that the cable would attach to?

Thanks,
Corbett
