Subject: Original Year License Plates

I really like the idea of getting an original year license plate for my '71
Westy.  Does anyone out there in TV land know of a direct source for
excellent condition cleared (not registered to any vehicle) California
license plates?

Somebody has got to have a stock pile of these.  Whenever I go to the
junkyard I notice all the license plates have been removed from the vehicles.
 Where do all these plates go to?  I'm picturing in my mind a small warehouse
in an undisclosed location with beautiful license plates stacked to the
rafters.  Somebody's got to know a connection for southern Cal.  I won't tell
anyone--honest.

Hey, Pomona swap meet is this weekend.  If you're going this Sunday and have
some nice plates for a '71 bring them along and I'll have my secretary call
your secretary.
