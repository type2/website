Subject: radio speaker questions

Hi all-

What is the stock radio speaker size for a '71 Bus?  Also, years ago I saw an 
aftermarket item (non-VW) that allowed two smaller speakers to be mounted in 
the stock location of a single, larger speaker.  Has such an item ever been 
made for a VW Bus?  Thanks.

Larry
