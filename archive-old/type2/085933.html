&gt;Was the ball joint bad, or just installed incorrectly.  The direction of
&gt;the joint as it is pressed in is important to allow the suspension to
&gt;work.  If it's wrong, it'll bind.

There is a possibility that you were charged for a defective part, and it 
was improper installation.  Did the same shop do all of the work?  Did you 
keep the 'bad' parts(in this case the balljoint)?  Check the part yourself 
and see if George's theory was correct.  If this is the case, you may be 
deserving a refund.
