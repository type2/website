Subject: Re: [T2] Info needed on AFM tuning by wideband -- desired AFRs

&gt;What I'm looking for is what AFR I should be looking
&gt;for under different driving conditions:
&gt;
&gt;-Idle
&gt;-Deceleration (no throttle)
&gt;-Cold Start
&gt;
&gt;-Cruise (flat ground, low throttle)
&gt;-Slowly accelerating (moderate throttle)
&gt;-Wide Open Throttle

Most of those are controlled by L-Jet and not easily adjustable. Strive to adjust the AFR when the engine is at normal operating temp and idling. Dialing in a particular set of readings while adjusting the wiper is time consuming.

&gt;I'm hoping that someone who has wideband tuned their
&gt;bus can provide some empirical data. Then I will
&gt;borrow the wideband over a weekend and tweak my AFM
&gt;until I am close to those.

These are the settings I chose that I decided were good after reading one of John C's posts from last year.

Air temp: 60F
head temp: 315F at 50mph, 390F at 70mph
AFR idle: 0.7% (14.21)
AFR light throttle: 0.1% (14.72)
AFR half throttle: 2.5% (13.56)
AFR WOT: 5% (12.64)
