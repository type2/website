Subject: rearended followup / swap interiors question

Hey there all,
        Well, I went to go look at the &quot;rust-free&quot; 73 last night, in
hopes of finding one to replace my sweet blue bus that was hit.  It
wasn't totaly rust-free, but there was very little.  Some at the
battery try and just a little underneath.  If I decide to get it, I'll
pick it up Saturday for $200, clean up the rust bits and spray the
bottom with the rubberized undercoating (I asked and some list members
say it comes in a spray can!!!!!!  Boy I tell ya, technology!)  I've
got a few questions if anyone has a moment to possible answer them.  

I currently have the camper top that goes straight up with the fold
out bed up there, fold out bed/rear seat, rear facing seat behind
driver, cabinets on the right side.   This one is a nine passegenger
bus. I don't think it should be too hard, but how hard do you think it
would be to swap the interiors?

The pop top on the new bus is the hinged kind, no bed up there.  They
made a cot or something to be used up there, am I right?  Are these
the cots I occasionally see someone selling on this list?  Also the
clips that secure the pop-top in the down possition are broken, these
should be easy to find and replace?  And how hard would it be to swap
the poptops?  I like the straight up one that I currently have, and
when needed its nice to have a real second bed up top. 

All in all, it looked pretty nice.  The full across front bench seat
(been wanting one of those), transmission bell housing looks clean
(not that I would know what to look for), engine compartment clean
with no engine, good dash and wheel wells.  I think I'll be picking it
up Saturday.  Joel had the sane advice of first putting a working bus
together that I am happy with from the two that I have, then think
about whether I want to put the time into making a second runnable bus
to pass on to a wannabusser.  

Thanks all for the advice and sentiments.  The person that hit me has
been pretty nice all along.  Wanting to make sure that I am happy and
comfortable with whatever deal we make.  Hope everyone is having a
good day.

take care,
        brandy
