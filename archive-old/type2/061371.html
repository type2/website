Subject: asbestos stash?

Hi All,

last night I ripped out the big steel heater tube out from under my bus. 
(in preparation for installing the BA4), and got covered in a cloud of 
dust/asbestos right when I was breathing in. - I had grit 'n' stuff in my 
mouth all evening after that.

I don't know if it was asbestos, but i think i'm mentally coming down 
with something.....tell me it wasn't!

It was the white fiborous(sp?) material on the inside of the plastic 
insulation cover.
