Subject: Re: [T2] Should caliper bleed screw leak?

That sounds fine.  I doubt the threads are worn out because most likely 
they haven't been turned more than a few times in the lifetime of the bus.

Plus, when you open it, you only open it enough to let the fluid out. 
Whether it comes out through the threads or through the nipple, it 
doesn't really matter - the fluid's coming out and that's what you want. 
  You just want to make dang sure that there is no fluid coming out 
while it's tight!!

&gt; might be an indicator of  overly worn out threads. Especially 
&gt; considering the amount of fluid that leaked which seemed excessive to me 
&gt; at the time but maybe it is not a big deal. Enough fluid leaked out to 
&gt; flow down and puddle at the bottom inside of the rim, then flowed down 
&gt; the tire and started puddling on the ground. I didn't time it but it was 
&gt; probably 4-5 minutes. It sounds from some of the responses that this 
&gt; might not be that unusual.
