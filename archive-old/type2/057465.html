&gt; Granted.  But if your engine ever gets hot and you let it idle to cool
&gt; down, you will be waiting a long time.

   See below -- mine drops right down when I get off the freeway.

&gt; 
&gt; Do you have a 4100lb bus?  Do you live in Dallas?  Do you ever drive your
&gt; bus long enough or fast enough to really heat it up?  Your oil temp may not
&gt; be too hot but your CHT seems high.  500?  Mine has never seen anywhere
&gt; near that temperature, even when I had the sender mounted at the spark plug.
&gt; 
    4100lb? What do you carry in that thing? My Westy is only 3400lb
empty. And I drive 14 freeway (75mph) miles each way to work, which
seems to get it just as hot as it ever gets on longer trips. My cyl temp
sender is mounted on #3 sparkplug, it -- until my unfortunate problem
with the fan hub key shearing -- never went over 450 max, ususally
around 350-400. Which is pretty reasonable temp range. And I've noticed
that when I hit the light off the exit, the temp has already dropped.
I've also noticed that outside temp doesn't seem to have any real
bearing on the engine temp -- I was getting the same temps in Wisconsin
in the winter -- it took a bit longer to get there maybe, but summer or
winter head temp seems just the same.
