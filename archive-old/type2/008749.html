Easy-


The best tool available to me is the one between my
ears.

Seriously.


If I had the money, I could buy any tool around. Money,
on the other hand, won't teach you how to understand a
manual.

Also, your brain is the &quot;tool&quot; that says &quot;Hmmmm, maybe
an 1835cc in my overweight '69 Westy is a bad idea, as
it just might over-heat&quot;.



If I had to choose something other than my brain; I'd
say this list.

&gt; Okay listees, this is a Friday survey:
&gt; 
&gt; What is, in your opinion, the most useful,
&gt; indespensible, 'changed your
&gt; life after you started using it' tool, for working
on
&gt; VW Campers? It
&gt; doesn't have to be big, expensive, complicated or
&gt; hard-to-find. Just the
&gt; tool that is 'brilliant'.
&gt; 
&gt; As well as the fun element, this could prove useful
&gt; to the amateur VW
&gt; mechanic just starting out, and also to the seasoned
&gt; mechanics who have a
&gt; wide range of tools and are looking for more to add
&gt; to the collection.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll start the ball rolling with:      thin-nosed
&gt; pliers.
&gt; 
&gt; Usual survey stuff, which (I think) is pmail me and
&gt; I'll compile a result
&gt; for the weekend. Or if its listworthy, you know
where
&gt; to post it :+)
