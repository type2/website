Subject: Heater Blower needed

Hey folks, I think this will be an easy one.

Recently I posted a note about problems with my heater blower blowing
the in line fuse that runs to the blower.  Many suggestions came through
about dissassembling the motor, cleaning and oiling, and reassembling.

I did that, and in the process found that the inside of the front
section of the motor (close to where the motor &quot;pin&quot; sticks out that the
fan is attached to) was in bad shape, and could be part of why it took
so much amps to turn the motor. (the insolator board material in which
the 2 small square metal housings that hold the magnets that rest on the
front of the pin was disintegrating, and these small metal holders would
no longer hold onto this board and were loose and flopping around and
left me no way to mount them) 

So now I am in the market for purchasing a new or rebuilt heater
blower.  Does anyone know where I can get one?  I'll buy a used one from
someone if need be, but would prefer to try for a new one that I won't
have to clean out for a while.   

If you know of where I could get one, I'd much appreciate it.   Thanks!
