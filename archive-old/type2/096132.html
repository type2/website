&gt; Well we got our engine running, we spun the dist, around 180 and she fired

&gt; they call a bosch 009. If it is what should we set the timing at.

yes the infamous 009......

best bet is to find out what the stock dist is for that engine and search
high and low, or even BustedBus for the correct one.  

the timing just cannot be gotten right with the 009 dist.
sorry
