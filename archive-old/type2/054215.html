Subject: Shift rod bushings

In the process of getting a rebuilt tranny and would like to change out the
shift rod bushings while the tranny is out of the bus.  I see that Bus
Depot has the front bushing, does anyone else carry the rear bushing??

Also, how difficult is it to replace these bushings?
