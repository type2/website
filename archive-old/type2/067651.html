Subject: HELP, stuck coupler bolt

So tonight I decided to replace my rear shift coupler. I removed the 
old one and put on the new. It was a very tight fit. 
I went to put the square headed bolt in, and it threaded in 
just fine. About halfway in it got really tight and then
loose again. It will not go any further in, or come out.
I tried pulling with all my weight (~210 lbs) while turning
and it won't budge. I tried pushing in while turning
with no effect. The bus shifts fine, but I am worried
about this bolt

I thought I *should* be able to string the wire through it
to prevent it from wiggling loose, but I am worried about the
slack causing excessive wear on the tranny input shaft.
SO, I would really like some input on this. Thank You
