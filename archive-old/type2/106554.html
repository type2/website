Subject: Re: [T2] Bilge blower Conversion Questions (&amp; I _did_ surf the
  T2 Archive!!!)

Hi Mike,

VW designed the fan to push air through the system. This way the air in 
the pipes is always pressurized in comparison to the outside 
environment. So if there's a leak, the air flows out of the pipes, not 
in. This is important, as it helps keep exhaust fumes and engine smells 
out of the interior of the bus. If you have an inline fan drawing air 
forward then it will create a low pressure zone in the pipe &quot;behind&quot; 
it, increasing the likelyhood of drawing in unwanted fumes if there's a 
leak.

The original blower fan pushing air into the heater boxes could easily 
be adapted to pull air from the interior of the bus, which would help 
improve the heating efficiency, and you get fresh cabin air instead of 
potentially stinky engine compartment air. I haven't done this to my 
bus yet, but I'm considering it.

I'd suggest you get a replacement 77 blower from a local wrecker or 
bustedbus_dot_com.

Happy trails,

&gt; I've gotten enough info from the Archives to do this, but I had a 
&gt; couple of
&gt; questions related to the installation:
&gt;
&gt; 1. My aux blower is completely shot.  I tried to turn it by hand 
&gt; tonight,
&gt; after flipping the lever got no response, and the fan turns with 
&gt; difficulty
&gt; and the fan motor seems to be turning and shifting in the housing.  I 
&gt; plan
&gt; on removing the aux fan completely, but wondered if I should simply 
&gt; install
&gt; a couple of filters on the tubes, or duct them up into the cabin area.
&gt; Suggestions?
&gt;
&gt; 2. I'm thinking about going with the Dodge light switch idea, as I 
&gt; like the
&gt; variable speed option that it provides, and wanted to make sure that I
&gt; understand the wiring correctly.  If I understand the posts that I 
&gt; reviewed,
&gt; I'll need to run the hot wire that feeds the bilge fan from the battery
&gt; through a fuse to the light switch and back through to the bilge fan.  
&gt; Does
&gt; this eliminate the need for a relay?  Will the Dodge light switch 
&gt; handle the
&gt; load?
&gt;
&gt; 3. What about the melted fan issue?  Can this be somewhat controlled by
&gt; adjusting the amount of heat let through the system by the heater 
&gt; flaps?
&gt; Or, would a temp sensor that auto cuts the fan out help to prevent 
&gt; this from
&gt; happening?  Or, would adding an inlet that adds cabin air to the mix 
&gt; just
&gt; before the bilge fan help?  Or, all three...?
