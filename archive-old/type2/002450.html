I recently heard that Veng, the Danish manufacturer of aftermarket body
panels and other stuff, went belly up.

It's a shame to see a manufacturer go. Strangely enough their website is
still on the air (http://www.veng.dk/out/95/9555/parts.en.html for bus
parts). I also heard their remaining type-2 inventory has been bought by
Alan Schofield in England and the molds were bought by someone else. Does
anyone know more about this? Ron, is this the same company you refer to as
'Dansh' (like in heat exchangers).

I fear this means loss of a source of good quality parts and possibly a
price increase of what's still available.
