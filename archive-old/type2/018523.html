For Sale: Side Step, the kind that slides into the jack ports on the
sliding door side.  It's aluminum clad steel.  I can't tell you if it's
a reproduction or original.  It's in good shape, but not perfect.
P-mail me if you are interested.  It's heavy, so it might be a good item
for somebody near Baltimore.
