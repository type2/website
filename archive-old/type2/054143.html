Subject: Charter Posting

Volks,

In general I think the bandwidth use here is good to excellent, and it's
not my purpose to quell any worthwhile bus discussion. However, the charter
has been substantially revised, nobody has posted it in quite a while,
somebody started a very silly survey, and there were two different episodes
off-list that involved privacy breaches today (one instance of address
harvesting/spamming and one instance of reflecting messages to the web
without obfuscating the addresses).

So I'm posting it. =^ )

We've tried to make the charter much more concise than it used to be
(though it is still long). It now includes a Privacy Policy that your
friendly neighborhood administrators take very seriously. Et cetera. Please
do read it through.

Thanks,
