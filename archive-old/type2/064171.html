Subject: Re: White Scum in Oil?

&gt;SO I went to add some oil. I noticed that on the inside of the oil filler
&gt;neck cap there was some white scum that looked like curdled milk.  It also
&gt;ran down the neck a bit.  Does anyone know what this is?  I am using 10W30

Its condensed water vapor, because you aren't getting the motor hot enuf,
long enough, to get the water evaporated.
