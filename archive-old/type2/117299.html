Subject: Re: [T2] intake air sensor in FI engine

&gt; I'm systematically working my way through the FI components, and 
&gt; noticed a peculiarity of the intake air sensor that I have not seed 
&gt; discussed in the archives.

It was suggested to me when I had this problem to place a small ressitor
of about 75ohm or so between the temp sensor 2 and the ECU as the engine
had a tendency to hunt and this smoothed out this hunting..

I never got a chance to check this out as other things intervened so as
they say YMMV
