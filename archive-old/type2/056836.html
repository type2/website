Well Howdy again....

  As most of you noted that my post earlier today was full of hope and
cheer over the purchase of a 76 Transporter. The good thing would be a
happy ending to this story as I rode off into the sunset....unfortunately,
that didn't happened. Since this is friday, and after being awake for 20
hours..I thought I would share some observations about buying a bus that
happens to be in the impound lot. For those of you who can't wait..DON'T
buy an impounded BUS!!!!

  This bus was purchased by the PO only 7 months ago and when I saw it
then, it was in real good shape although it needed some work (What bus
doesn't??). The gentleman's father decided that they didn't need the fuel
injection system so they bought a Weber Progressive with the appropriate
intakes. They dropped the engine and replaces the push rod seals, front and
rear oil seals, and oil cooler seals, then put the engine back in.
Somewhere in this process, the throwout bearing fork didn't quite line up
(bent a little) and within 2 months, the clutch goes out. Also during this
2 months, the PO decides the bus needs a radio and installs one himself
(You can kind of guess where this story is heading!!)

  A month and a half ago, the PO approches me to see if I wish to purchase
this bus, since his lease is up and it has to be moved. I told him that I
didn't have his asking price and politely declined. Too bad, I thought, it
really is worth what he is asking for it (mistake #1).

  Jump ahead to a couple of days ago. The PO comes over to the house and
said to me,&quot;Art, if you want the bus, I'll take what ever the impound fee
is for it&quot; to which he tells me is only $325 (mistake #2). Takes me the
next day to convince my wife what a great deal this is going to be and
scrape the money together. 

  Now we are at today! Excitement and joy over getting the new bus and
dreaming of all the things I'll be doing for the next few weeks. Drive over
to the PO's fathers house, pile into his truck (going to pull the bus back
for me) and drive to the impound lot. I gave him $400 to go in and settle
his debt (mistake #3) while I go in the back to see the bus (Excuse me sir,
you can't go back there!!). I went into the office where I see the PO
arguing over the cost of the impoundment...started to get that sinking
feeling you get when things aren't going good. Well, the PO and impoundment
folks work it out, now we are ready to get the bus.

  We went into the yard to retrieve the bus. I started to notice several
things..formost of which is the bus isn't in as good of shape as I
remembered it. The outside is ok, but the interior...OH MY!!!! (Remember
the radio installation??) The door was unlocked, I asked the PO for the
keys. &quot;Uh..the key is a hundred miles from here&quot; (gasping for breath now
and sinking quicker!) He ask, &quot;Can't we just tow it the way it is?&quot; Now I'm
starting to get a little upset. The PO's father looks at him like only a
father can do. Meanwhile there are several cars around the bus and the
impound lot's tow truck is on a call(It's going to be about an hour and a
half, I'll give you a call when we get it out!!) Totally sunk now!!!!!!!!

  To end this tirade, I spent $400 and don't have a thing to show for it
and I'm tired. Hopefully I'll get the bus here tomorrow, but the way this
deal is going, I'm not about to hold my breath. Sorry for the long story,
but I really had to get this off my chest and prepare for the retelling to
the wife.
