Subject: Re: [T2] Is my buss worth working on

Thanks for the answer but the problem is that I doesn´t even know if I have 
to weld??
Please have a look at my pictures on the buss ( 
http://download.tripodnet.nu:81/Folkes_hemsida/index.htm )and write back on 
what you think. Everyone says differant and it´s very hard to know witch 
ones to belive...
How much can you fix without welding?
I just whant to get the buss in usable condition, if the rapairs hold for a 
year a am satisfied.

&gt;Listen my friend, I have an associates degree in the field, but welding 
&gt;body
&gt;panels is really not for the novice. If your heat is too high, you will 
&gt;burn
&gt;a hole right through the sheet metal. If it is just to drive, you may want 
&gt;to
&gt;try riveting sheet metal on. There is info out there on mig, but be very
&gt;careful. If you decide to do the work yourself, make sure you try welding 
&gt;on
&gt;some old sheet metal first. I would try to use old VW body panels, since 
&gt;that
&gt;is the thickness, and type steel you will be using. A mig is pretty easy to
&gt;run, just the heat you must be careful with. With parts, labor, and cost of
&gt;renting a machine, you may be able to get a good bus body for that. Weigh
&gt;your options!
