Subject: FI Wires: Where to *these* go?
Message-ID: &lt;GHFBCEBKJIHIAAAA_at_theglobe_dot_com&gt;

Well, I found two wires not connected to anything. Hmmmm....maybe there's a connection between these and why my bus will only start briefly. Using an ohm meter, I was able to get 0 resistance between one wire and pin 9 of the ECU plug...which maps to pin 9 of the intake air sensor. The other wire shows 0 resistance to pin 12 of the ECU. Problem is, I can't figure out where/how to hook these up. 

I have a '77 engine/FI system. From what I can tell in Bentley, pin 12 is a dead end. It's probably for some option I don't have, like smooth running engine (M-code 777). ;-)

The wire to/from pin 9, however, probably ought to connect to something. I'll be indebted to anyone who can help me figure this out. These wires both come off the FI harness. They have female ends encased in thin protective plastic shells...not thin like M&amp;M; just thin if you think of normal VW connectors.

Thanks! Joe
