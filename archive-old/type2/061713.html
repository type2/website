&gt; 
&gt; I always thought 8.5:1 to be the upper limit for regular, at least
&gt; that's what I've read in many &quot;hot rod&quot; books and articles. Also,
you might
&gt; check the page that George sent the other day for the Subaru trade,
they're
&gt; saying that 8.7:1 runs okay with 87 octane.

I can't find that reference on the KEP page, but it might have been
for for the watercooled Subaru engine.  The aircooled is a different
situation and probably would require higher octane than regular at
that compression.  They show the stock type 4 compression at 7.3:1,
which sounds much more reasonable.
