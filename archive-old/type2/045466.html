Hmmm... I'm not sure exactly which piece of tin you're referring to, but on my carburated engine, the piece of tin behind the oil cooler simply lifts straight up and out once the upper cylinder cover tin is removed.  On my engine there were no fasteners that could not be removed with the engine in.  I say &quot;on my engine&quot; because I have not tried the same with a fuel injected engine, and although I believe it wouldn't be any different, I'm not 100% positive.

FWIW, there IS one thing stopping you from removing the pistons from an installed engine - the piston pins on the drivers side cannot be removed from the front because of the oil cooler boss, and from the rear the bellhousing interferes.  I got around this by filing a notch in my bellhousing to accomodate the piston pin.  Shameful, yes, but that's what I had to do.
