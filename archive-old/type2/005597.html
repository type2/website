Hey Kind Volks;

I just wanted to thank all of you who responded to my post about the engine
compartment seal and my engine size.
(you are all sooo helpful!!)
I installed the engine seal no prob!!  what a snap!  took me all of 15
minutes to jimmy it in there!

anyway I had another little question~(or two)

well I noticed that the rear CV joint boot on the inner side was badly
eroded and loose...oil has soaked the whole axle rod...
how big of a job is it to replace the CV joint boot seal??
would this be a job for the VW doc....and if so, how much would it run me in
$$?
do y'all think I should replace them ALL while I'm at it, or just the one
bad one?

Also....the grip tape under my front seats was all eroded and torn so I
pulled it all out and was thinking of sanding it down and painting some nice
designs on the seat/foot rests (seeing as how I am a graduating art student
and might as well put some of that to use, hehe)
so anyway,,,
can anyone suggest some paint that will stick to the metal without peeling
after I prime it?
would acrylics work if I put on a sealer or would it require enamels?

Thank you kindly!
I'm happy to have found you all by the way...and I'm honored to learn from
such wise gurus on type 2's!
(I wanted to chime in too and say that I have ALSO had really good
experience with Bus Depot online as well~I just installed the eng. seal and
sideview mirrors I bought from them actually!)
*RON your company rocks!!*

peace,
