Subject: Re: [T2] Restore or Not
X-Sun-Charset: US-ASCII

	Victor,
	Tough call- restoration always costs twice what you
expect and takes six times as long, by my experience. So
if you want to drive your bus while you work on it, and
it needs both rubber bits and paint AND welding work...
	I'm with David Kelly, the beige-colored 2 part or
3 part primers that a professional body shop uses are
WATERPROOF. Prep time is most of the cost of a good paint job.
Do the prep yourself, let them do the expensive stuff, you do
the labor-intensive parts.
If you can't afford the full-bore resto job in one go, take everthing 
off the front, fix the rust, have it professionally SEALED AND PRIMED
and the install your new rubber bits. Then do one side, then
the other. Etc. To get a good paint job, you'll want to pull off
all the rubber and glass first, but that can be the last step,
since the pro-primer is waterproof.
	NO OTHER PRIMER IS WATERPROOF! All they grey, black and brown
automotive and rusty metal primers will actually allow water to
get down to the metal. After a while, rust will 'bloom' uniformly
under the primer. Most cars painted primer grey with rattle cans
have original paint under the grey, but replacement fenders and hoods, 
sold in primer, are often seen blooming with rust. Its so sad :(
	You can get better than Maaco, but its your money. Write up
a description of what you want (sealer and water proof primer,
on the whole front or side, (remember underneath if its' been
worked on). Note how long you'll give them (most shops specialize
in quick-turn insurance work, let them keep it for a couple weeks
and do it as a fill-in and you might get some savings... but then
you can't be driving ;( )

	My brother and sister-in-law did their Beetle up to about 95/100.
Looks new to me. They made a spread-sheet for all the rubber bits and
other stuff to replace, then entered the prices from WCM, RMMW, etc.
Then considered what they knew and what others said, not always choosing
the cheapest! Eventually the had big boxes from all the suppliers...

	The other option would be to do the mechanical fixes, welding,
etc, and then just brush-paint POR-15. You or someone else can strip
it and do proper paint later.

	The whole point is to stop it gettting rusty-ER. Rattle-can primer won't
do that.

	Bill
