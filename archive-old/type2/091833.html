Subject: Idle problem goes beserk

After I helped it.... God did not mean for me to work on cars....

Amigos,

 I have a problem. My 75 Westy 1800 AFI was running like new for months.
Two weeks ago I started noticing a slight problem idling, Nothing much,
just a little rough. I though, “Self, this is my 5th injector messing up.”
So I added a small amount of Berryman’s B-12 to the gas to clean the
injectors.

It seemed to improve the issue slightly, but all of a sudden, I cannot get
the thing to start and idle without putting the gas pedal to the floor.
When it runs then, it is rough, and will NOT idle at all.

I refilled the tank with gas (thinking I may have added “too much” B-12,
which is unlikely) but it made no difference. All hoses are tight and in
their correct places.

Any thoughts? Before I load this on a trailer and haul it 90 miles to my
closest VW mechanic?

Thanks
