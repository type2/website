Subject: headliner replacement befuddlement.

I have a '79 westy. and when i got her, the vinyl headliner was long
since dead and gone with only a few bare scraps of the originally bumpy
stuff clinging on for dear life. I was having no problem with this, but
then i got bored of that, so today i decided to re-do the headliner with
some fabric i have lying around. so i undid all the screws and the
washers and put them together neatly. Enter problem stage right. Just HOW
do you go about getting that top piece down (which i was both suprised
and impressed to find out it was actually wood) I guess, because it seems
to be attatched to the piecest that run above the back windows. So how
are you supposed to get it down to re-cover it? if anyone has done this
before, and i'm assuming Someone has, Please help!
