Subject: PLEASE HELP--rear main oil seal (possible leak)
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello everyone--

Just got back from a trip to the Northeast...without my bus 
unfortunately...saw a few buses up in Northampton Mass---I need to fix my oil 
leak problem---I'm trying to diagnose it and gathering from the archives...it 
could either be my REAR MAIN SEAL, OIL COOLER SEAL, PUSH ROD TUBE 
SEALS.....First off I only leak oil when I am driving..I do not get any drip 
when I am parked---My left(driver side of the bus) heat exchanger has a spot 
where it looks like oil has leaked on it...which could mean my Oil Cooler 
seal....but I also notice some oil on my cooling tin on the right side of 
engine..which could mean my Push Rod Tube Seals I'm guessing-----How would I 
know if it is my Main Seal? Can that be checked without pulling the engine? I 
am heading north on a trip this coming Monday and need to get this oil leak 
fixed---Thanks for the help---Can't wait to see you all at Everybus 
2001....Look forward to it......Adam
