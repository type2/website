&gt;I am curious, though, about the future of the hubcap. I would like to take
&gt;it, back to Asheville, and then maybe towards the general direction of
&gt;Yankeeland, but no further than the Mason-Dixon line. Alternatively, I have
&gt;a business trip planned to Canada, (Kitchener, Ontario) the first week in
&gt;May and I could drop it off along the way. But I fear that there may be a
&gt;*Debacle at Everybus* over the cap. I certianly do not want to be
&gt;memorialized in a flow chart, or really to give my life over any specific
&gt;cause.
&gt;
&gt;However, I did notice that the person currently in possesion of the cap is
&gt;not specifically named. If the future of the cap has been predetermined, or
&gt;if it is currently under the administration of the Federal Witness
&gt;Protection Program, I understand.

I know nothing about the bus tour other than it keeps getting stuck.  
I talked to the guy who had it in Jax on Sunday and I offered to get 
it moving again.  I drove it a couple of blocks to pass it on to 
someone else just to get it moving.  Andrew Whitlock has it.  I don't 
know the itenery, but figured since he was going to EveryBus that 
someone there could put it back on course.

Look forward to seeing you this weekend.

Dave
