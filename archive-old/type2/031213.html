&gt; one at a time.  I'm running on three cylinders. #4 is out of commision. I

&gt; The compression is o.k. at 100 in high altitude on that cylinder same as 
&gt; the others. What's the story.

check your fuel injector on that cyl.  is the plug wet??  is the injector
stuck or clogged, is it getting a trigger signal.  maybe the balancing
resistor is bad for that cyl.

you need to determine if it is fuel or fire. and then back track from
there to the problem
