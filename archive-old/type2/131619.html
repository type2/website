Subject: List Mailings Incompatability

Is anyone out there using Hotmail for the List and having problems receiving 
postings? I have missed quite a few in the last couple of days. I 
fortunately have another email account(Non-Hotmail) that is subscribed to 
the list so that if I have problems I can use either. I was just wondering 
if there are others out there with the same stuation or if maybe there is a 
compatability problem with the server and Hotmail.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
