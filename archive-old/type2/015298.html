&gt;Mark, I'm afraid I don't have any solutions for you either. My '72 suffers
&gt;from a similar e-brake disfunction,

One possable cause is the difference in the diameter of the drums to the
shoes.
If the drums are worn a beyond minimum spec., stock radius shoes will have
a very small area of contact. They glaze over and are easily contaminated with
brake dust. Since the lion's share of braking comes from the front brakes,
this ineffientcy at the rear is not noticed, but the e-brake working 
independantly shows it's nature. 

Check the drum diameters and compare to specs. Focus on the wear pattern
on the shoes. Are they wearing mostly on the mid to upper surface and
the lower surfaces little if at all???
