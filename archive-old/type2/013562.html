To: TYPE2_at_TYPE2.COM

During the movie &quot;Hair&quot; while it shows a crowded city
where everyone is about to dance, right before the
movements of the actors become choreographed, if you
look carefully in the very background, a green early
seventies bus speeds by... Kindof hard to catch if
you're not very observant, but I notice stuff like that.
