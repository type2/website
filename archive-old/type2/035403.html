Subject: RE: Subject: Source for 2L heads?

&gt; it seems to me that a guarantee on heads is less than comforting
&gt; if you have to drop your engine, dismantle it, and ship the heads
&gt; off to get any satisfaction.


But even more importantly, is the warranty honored at all?  Read the fine
print. These warranties are void if the head has been overheated or
improperly installed AS DETERMINED BY THE REBUILDER, the very person who
stands to lose if they declare it a valid warranty issue.  I don't need to
point out the risk to the consumer here.  I can't speak for Stephens, but as
for AVP, I have always found them to be very honest in this regard. They
gave the customer the benefit of the doubt on all three warranty claims I
have had with their products (out of many, many sold), even though one was
_very_ questionable in my opinion.  (Can't say I'd have done the same, to be
honest.)  In two of the three cases, they even reimbursed a high percentage
of the labor cost despite the fact that this was not part of their written
warranty (one without even being asked).  It is for this reason that I am a
believer in their product.  It's not just that I think they make a good
product, but I really like the way they do business.
