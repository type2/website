Why not ask, right? If anyone can use the services of a bus enthusiast, 
complete with some self learned mechanical ability and 6.5 years as a 
computer programmer, let me know. I'm in Hampton NH. If I could turn my bus 
hobby into a sustainable source of income I'd be rather happy.

Hey there Volks,

I've thought of the same thing, BUT the guy I bought my bus from (Dave from
Martha Vineyard Island's Bug'n'Bus), told me never to make your hobby into a
job. Once it becomes a JOB it usually becomes less FUN. 

Now banging out some quick HTML every once and awhile for some BUS money, is
another thing (I'm wondering what the per page rate should be). I usually just
do some pro-bono (free) work for friends who are selling their buses, but if
get paid for it too, that's great.

I like having a small hobby vw bus site, but I ain't gonna quit my day job :)

Bill M. in CT.: We hafta start getting a webpage together for the next Buses by
the Cider Mill. I might actually bring my bus to that one :)
