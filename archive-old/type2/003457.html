Subject: Mounting Bolt Pattern Question
Date: Fri, 20 Apr 2001 22:36:42 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

New to the list.  Searched archives for a possible answer to my question
with no luck.

I have a Type 4 engine (CV case) from an '82 Vanagon.  I acquired this
longblock to possibly install in a homebuilt airplane I am constructing.
The engine mount for my plane is patterned for a Type 1 VW 2180cc Engine.  I
was originally under the impression that all Type 4 cases had the same
mounting bolt pattern as the Type 1 so conceivably I could hang my Type 4
engine on the same engine mount.  (I understand the weight issue of the Type
4 vs the Type 1).

I have since been informed the '80-'83 Vanagon engine case is unique and
will not &quot;bolt-up&quot; to the same Type 1 mount.  Is this correct?

Will my Type 4 &quot;CV&quot; case bolt up to a Type 1 mount?  If not....which Type 4
case will?

TIA,
