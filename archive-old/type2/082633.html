Subject: Re: [T2] repair reservoir

&gt; I have glued over cracks before-
&gt; The key feature to gluing over cracks in plastic is to really rough up
&gt; the surface so it will grip the glue.  Using a razor, I score it with
&gt; many parallel lines; sanding it also roughs it.
&gt; When I cracked my pool intake leaf strainer (off above ground pool) I
&gt; roughed up the surface around the crack and then encased it in silicone
&gt; calk.  Try E6000 urethane glue/calk; this is very tough but has a bit of
&gt; elasticity that should allow it not to crack from the plastic like epoxy
&gt; might.
&gt;

E6000 is more of a contact cement but flexible and Ive no proof it will
stand up to brake fluid or stick to the reservoir material.
BTW you can get pretty loopy in a closed shop reconing woofers with E6000
which btw is exactly the same thing as GOOP. Same company same product
different package.
thanks.it may be worth a try. filed.
