Subject: engine number confusion

&gt;...I'm glad I raised this topic.  I wish I knew what the definitive answer
&gt;was!  Now I wonder where multiple people got the same information from
&gt;regarding GE engines being california only that is posted in the type II
&gt;library if it's not correct.  This is interesting!  Greg


This information comes from page 33 of the Wilson manual. This is a great
manual but none are perfect. If you triangulate with the Muir manual p.330,
you'll see that generally GD code motors were for 75-77 buses, and generally
GE were for 77-79, but technically the First GE's were put into buses
beginning
in August 76 according to Muir, but not always, since I once had a 77 with a
GD. I believe that GE does not mean California only.
