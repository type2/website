&gt;Is anyone but me still running 6V in a splitty? I think I need a new battery,

&gt;I'm getting frustrated with the thing not starting reliably despite a brand
&gt;new 6V starter and new #2 cables from the battery to ground and the starter.
&gt;The battery is old but passes a load test. Engine is fresh, but no harder to
&gt;turn over than other vw engines I have. The symptom is the solenoid engages,
&gt;but the starter turns very slowly (approx 30 rpm to 0 rpm depending on how
&gt;long I've been cranking it). Amazingly, sometimes this is enough to start
&gt;it.

Hook up a volt meter to the starter and see what the voltage is at the
starter (not at the battery) while you are cranking.  If it is below 5
volts then your battery might not be up to the task or there might be a
problem with the cables.  Next test voltage at the battery during cranking.
If the voltage is high at the battery and low at the starter, the cable is
the problem.  If voltage is low at the battery (and low at the starter),
you either have a weak battery or a starter that is drawing way too much
current.  Your battery should be able to crank out 100 amps or more without
dropping below 5 volts, but under excessive loads even a strong battery
will not be able to maintain voltage.  You can have the current draw
checked by a shop or you can buy a meter to check it yourself.  Might cost
you more than a new battery, but at least then you will know.  Hope this
helps...
