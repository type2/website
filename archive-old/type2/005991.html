Howard here.  New to list.

I have a '70 Camper with a bench seat (-y'all call them &quot;Z-beds&quot; or is that 
something else?  Couldn't find a description for &quot;Zbed&quot; in archives or 
library.) that goes allllll the way across -no [window-obstructing] closet 
(suicide cabinet?).  It's great -much more practical than a closet there 
would be.

Question is:  was this an original Westy option or has one of it's 2 
previous owners custom built it -it looks like it's original.
