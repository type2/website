Dear fellow listees,
My 79 with a 2.0L has been experiencing a puzzling problem.  It experiences
brief (2 secs at most) loss of power intermittantly.  When driving a while it
will be a loss of power usually noticed when shifting or when idling; but it
won't stall.  I can't predict when it will do it,  It just seems to take a bit
of driving before it acts up. 
I don't notice it at full highway speeds no matter how long I drive.
Any suggestions on where to start?
is it most likely fuel or electrical related?
