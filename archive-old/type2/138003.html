Subject: Cylinders Stuck to Cylinder Head

Hello all,

 

I've been slowly disassembling a non-running engine out of a donor bus as my
first engine rebuild (learning project) and tried to remove the head and
cylinders.  The cylinders are stuck to the head, and I have not been able to
remove them.  It seems they were installed using some kind of sealer that
has them glued on solidly.  Looking closely at the cylinder to case
surfaces, I see what appears to be Permatex Aviation-type sealant residue.
I'm assuming the same was done between the cylinders and head.  I've tried
solvent, penetrating oil, heat, and persuasion with a rubber mallet and
prying (as much as I felt comfortable doing without breaking cooling fins),
but all to no avail.  Anybody have any suggestions?  Library and archives
did not yield any answers. 

 

Thanks,

 

Markus Bahnemann
