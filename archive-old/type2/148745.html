Subject: 73 bus valve problems

adjusted valves approximately 2 weeks ago.

yesterday I removed left side carb, cleaned,
plugged &quot;idle cutoff&quot; solenoid receiver hole
(the solenoid is bad, and the threads on the
carb are stripped, causing vacuum leak)

It ran great for the 10 minutes I tested it.

last night I went for a drive, and there was
extreme loss of power, backfiring.

I pulled the air filter, removed plastic
intake manifold from carb, and it was
shooting air/fuel mixture out of carb
when trying to start it...

I opened up the left hand valve cover,
turned engine to #3 firing position, and
checked the valves.  Exhaust... fine.
Intake:  about 1/4&quot; clearance between
rocker and valve stem....

The lock-nut was tight.  I am positive
I got it tight when I adjusted it the other
day.

what could cause this sudden increase
of clearance between rocker and valve
stem?

bent pushrod?
suddenly worn cam?
suddenly worn valve stem?
suddenly worn cam bearings?
something dropped into intake
manifold, and messed something up
in the head?  I am 99% certain I didn't
drop anything in there, but anything is
possible.

The bus was running fine before I
took out the carb and cleaned it.  The
problems I am having now are not carb
problems though...  The valve has become
way out of adjustment.

Any ideas?

Jen
