Subject: Used Tools - Jessup MD

Ref my previous post, there is a Saturday/Sunday flea market north of Jessup 
MD on route 1 that has one vendor with a floor full of wrenches and sockets 
and the like.  Right next to him is another vendor with a much smaller 
collection, but with some neat things.

I got my 22mm Husky open/ box wrench plus 19mm, 17mm, 15mm, 12mm, 10mm Husky 
plus tiny vice Grip [Peterson, of course] plus set of 1/4&quot; metric Craftsman 
sockets plus a bunch of other &quot;good to have at least one of&quot; pieces from the 
the smaller selection [like a normal length screwdriver that perfectly fits 
the cheese head cooling tin screws, 3/8&quot; extensions &amp; U-joint, 3/8&quot; to 1/2&quot; 
adapter..) for $26.

If anyone is going up there today, be sure to go EARLY..  They seem to close 
about 4PM, and are very crowded.

Good luck.  Maybe I will see you there today, after services.

BTW, both Crazy Ray's have NO vw bus or Vanagon, but the Jessup CR does have 
some decent beetles for those of you who 'go both ways'  &lt;Jeff, are you 
listening??&gt;
