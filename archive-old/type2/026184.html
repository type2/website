	&gt;60 on a gradual incline...like Denver to Leadville

	Having driven from Denver to Aspen recently, I don't recall ANY
gradual 
	inclines between Denver and Leadville!!

Must mean the long way around.  A few years ago I towed a Type 3 Ghia
(behind a Type 3 Ghia) up the Arkansas River valley through Leadville on my
way back to California.  I chose the route because its the same one the
trains use so I figured it had to be real gradual.  In my case I had to
stick to 3rd gear most of the way up but I would think that a properly
tuned, unladen Bus ought to be able to keep the speed up except for some of
the curves.
