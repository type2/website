Ok,

I cancelled the job for now. They were untra pleased with me about it 
because they already purchased the heads and are having them shipped as we 
speak, but whatever, they can use them on someone elses if I find out this 
was total BS anyway from another source.

While the shop I will be heading to now is a good 40 miles away from home, 
and that means I will be sitting on my thumb on my next day off, it will be 
worth knowing.

Last questions :

How do you bring up all of these facts to your mechanic without feeling like 
you are insulting them, or without making them feel like your being 
overbearing? I don't know that either place would intentionally make someone 
feel this way, but typically, doesn't that feel like how ppl react when you 
question and question their practices, with the only thing to back you up is 
an online community? Many seem to write all of us off as do it yourselfers 
without a knowledge of what works and what doesnt when you do this day in 
and day out VS a few one time, at home tests.

any thoughts on that are welcome. =)
