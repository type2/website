Subject: Auxiliary Heater

My daily driver is a Jeep, which is one cold ride, especially in this bitter 
weather we have been having in Upstate NY.  Someone on my Jeep list 
recommended one of these little auxiliary heaters you can pick up for around 
$30 and they plug into your cigarette lighter.  I was thinking one might be 
good for my bus; has anyone tried these?  I know it's a pretty big space to 
heat with one, but I thought it might be better than what I have which is no 
heat at all.  I don't like the gas heaters I have seen for VWs and hope this 
will be a viable alternative!

Thanks in advance,

Tracy Hill
