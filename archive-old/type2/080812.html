Just wanted to thank Mr. Van Ness for the info on changing the spring on =
the front lock.  I just did both doors today and they both work just =
great.  I am having the same sort of problem with the sliding door on my =
71 Westy and wonder if there is a cure?  It locks but the key is not =
able to turn the lock to open it.  Any suggestions are appreciated.=20
