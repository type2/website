Subject: Re: [T2] Door Weather Stripping????

Yeah, I think you're right... I'm going to have to trim it. I didn't get
my seals from Bus Depot, I think they came from Wolfsburg west.. I'm
really not sure, they were in the bus (in the packaging) when I bought
it. When I bought the Bus about 6 months ago, it literally was completely
apart. There were NO windows installed, all the seats were removed, there
was no weather stripping of any kind..... 

You can see pictures of it at:

I've had a lot of fun working on this Bus. I just want to make sure I do
everything right. 

It's kinda sad too, I mean, it's good, but it's also Sad. I see a LOT of
these transporters in the junkyard. I honestly see like... at least 2-3
new Busses every time I go to the junkyard (about once every 2 weeks).
Most of them are campers too.

&gt; Todd,
&gt; I just installed new door seals from Bus Depot in my Single cab.  
&gt; Are you
&gt; sure you have the seal completely seated in the groove?  Use a 
&gt; screwdriver
&gt; to press it in.  Is it glued all the way around?  Can you see where 
&gt; it is
&gt; rubbing or hitting?  Get under the door and check to see what hits 
&gt; first.
&gt; Can you see the seal bulging in any spot when the door is closed?  
&gt; If you
&gt; can, slice off the offending piece(s) a little at a time as you can 
&gt; always
&gt; take more off.  Hard (but not impossible) to put some back on. If 
&gt; you do
&gt; need to put some back on or fix a tear.  Super glue works great on 
&gt; this.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this helps,
&gt; Snoopy
