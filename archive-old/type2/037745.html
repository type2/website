Subject: GEX Turnkey observations...

Hey folks..

Got a call the other day from an old friend.  He bought a turnkey engine
for his 71 super from GEX. (no, he didnt ask anyone first...)

1599 for the engine, 109 for &quot;remanufactured&quot; german heater boxes, 45 to
have the engine balanced (he talked them down from 95)...he selected the
oh so wonderful 4tip Monza style exhaust. 35$ crate charge, and (i think)
160$ shipping (No COD, no core)

The engine is configured for a 71 bug, so it is a dual port, with Brosol
34 Pict 3 (complete with the decel valve setup!), bosch generator, dog
house oil cooler, and late pressure plate(VW of Brazil).

The case is a reman AH (AS 41, germany).  The heads are inhouse rebuilds,
they told him that the cam/crank/rods/pistons/cyls/lifters are all brand
new.

They sent the waycool 36hp style fan shroud that is available on the
aftermarket with the doghouse attached, and heater outlets that face
straight out the back (FIF) of the shroud.  Tiny thing.  All the engine
tin installed on the engine appears to be new aftermarket tin, and fits
just like you'd expect aftermarket tin to fit.

The rear section of tin (FIF) has large cutouts for the preheater tube
flanges, with no capacity to install the small pieces of factory sealing
tin, nor any other way of sealing this area off.

They did not include the lower J shaped tin, nor the 2 small pieces that
bolt to the rear (FIF) of the head-cyl tin, that hang down next to the
cylinders.  They did have the under-cyl tin installed, as well as the 2
small pieces in the heads. (one was falling out, so i removed it and
flattened the tabs that it uses to hold tot he head for a better fit).

The case is clean and painted light grey (after assembly, all case
hardware/threads are painted over, as well as the case seam), the
cylinders appear to have been painted, and the heads looked clean fron the
underside.  The case has a variety of GEX stickers and stamping just to
the front of the shroud, around the case seam.

The heater boxes are painted an ugly metalic grey, but do look and feel
german, and have absolutly no rust at any of the usual locations. (I
wonder if they'll sell these outright..55 bucks each doesnt sound bad)
These .included. good linkage bits that were appropriate for a 71 super.
(springs and barrel nuts as well)


The manifold center is of the aftermarket variety, and does not come iwth
the preheat risers installed.  They went in with a little oil, a lot of
twisted and pushing, and more then a few colorful words.  Oh, and some
hammer blows to get it to seat fully.  The passenger side preheat flange
lined up fairly well where it should (not counting any deficencies in the
monza), but the drivers side was way off.  Took some long bolts and lots
of bending to get it to pull tot he right place, before removing the
long bolts one at a time in exchange for shorter ones.

The muffler (from GEX) came with the heaterbox donuts and clamps, but no
M8 nuts for any of the 8 studs, nor any nut/bolt combos to bolt the
preheat risers to their flanges.  they did include a gasket set that had
all 6 needed exhaust gaskets.

The monza fit like usual, bad.  Worse still, though, the passenger side
heater box had some sort of ring welded to the output pipe that the donut
and muffler inlet slide over.  This prevented the exhaust from fully
slding on the pipe, which caused all sorts of problems getting the flange
on that side to bolt to the head.

We ended up griding off half of the donut and further loosengin the heater
box from the head to get it mostly together.  Still a small leak at the
head/flange though.

Back to the shroud, they installed the various rubber seals for the
exhaust from the doghouse cooler, as well as the foam seal at the &quot;elbow&quot;
piece that directs the air from the side of the cooler down to the outlet
pipe.  No provision on this shroud for the bolt that goes to the hoover
bit.

Hey purchased an &quot;installed kit&quot; from them, which was supposed to include
the engine compartment seal, as well as various other bits.  It did not
include the firewall side seal, only the 3 sided piece.  Good thing i had
an extra on hand (come on, GEX! its a 5 dollar part!!)

The engine with a length of new metal fuel line, as well as lengths of
braided style line between the brosol fuel pump and the line and carb.
They included another bit of braided line for the connection tot he car's
fuel line.  Hose clamps were installed on all joints, and a section of
split line was used as a grommet through the firewall tin.  No clamps were
included for the joint from metal-braided-metal above the transmission,
though.

They included an uninstalled new oil pressure sender.

He ordered the &quot;full flow&quot; oil filter on this engine.  They installed the
oil-pump mount style that sticks out sideways, using bolts though the
assembly to the case, instead of studs/nuts.

All galley plugs had been removed and replaced, with a sort of rubbery
white sealent with them.  There are signs of judicious use of various
RTVish sealant around.  The oil pump, and gen stand both have oozings from
under them, as wella s the fuel pump at both joints.  there are drips of
some sort of RTVish sealant from under the cylinders, as well as the heads
(!!).

They included a barely long enough section of heater hose (stretched to
its max, it .just. fit after evenly being cut in two).


They claim that the made two runnings of the engine, and adjusted the
valves before shipping. Exhaust ports showed light carbon.  They also set
the timing of the 009 distributor prior to shipping.

Dipstick showing empty, I removed the oil filter to find it full of some
sort of oil.  It smelled just like new vinyl.  Pouring a bit out showed it
full of metal particals.  the color was a nice new gold, but it was
streaked with black/grey.

Draining the sump left us with another 3/4 quart of this substance, with
more black stuff, and more metal particals. &quot;Add oil and drive carefully&quot;
my ass.

A prerun valve adjustment showed all valves extremely tight (.002,
.001...), except #3, which were more like .004.

First fire, after bulding oil and fuel pressure was fairly successful.
Damn thing fired straight up.  the timing light showed about 35-38
degrees of advance (total) though, and the points were adjusted about
right. (my tach/dwell was elsewhere..)

It being about 1am, and in a neighborhood that forbid car maintenance, we
only ran it for 5-8 minutes.


We were going to change the filter and oil today, and proceed to break the
cam in, but it looks like it will happen a bit later.

Thats it, so far.  We'll see how it goes.  I've soundly instructed the
owner in the way of a good breakin, as well as why, so if he has gone on
without me he knows what to do.;)

well, thats that.
