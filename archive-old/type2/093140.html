Subject: Re: [T2] Type III motor in late model Bay


&gt;You can call this &quot;thinking outside the box&quot;, &quot;having a brain fart&quot;, 
&gt;&quot;inquiring minds want to know&quot;  or &quot;what the h*ll has he been smoking&quot; but 
&gt;has anyone ever tried to put a type III motor in a late model bay that was 
&gt;designed for the type IV motor?

Dunno. The tin is similar in that it is a pancake too.

&gt;But back to my question.  With the new aluminum type I cases out there 
&gt;(universal case??), I was thinking that the type III configuration is 
&gt;similar to the type IV and that it might just fit.  You could stroke it 
&gt;and easily build a 2 liter engine that is very reliable if you don't get 
&gt;carried away.  Parts should be cheaper than for a type IV motor unless the 
&gt;stroker crank and bigger pistons negates the type I cost 
&gt;advantage.  Possibly no one has done this because the sheet metal would 
&gt;have to be improvised a little, possibly because type III motors are less 
&gt;common or possibly no one has thought of it.  Another advantage of a type 
&gt;III motor over the type I would be easier access in the engine compartment.

You would be subject to the same argument about the Type IV 2.0 versus the 
Type I 2.0.

Type IV offers larger and beefier everything. Type IV offers 2.0 out of the 
box where the Type I requires alot of expensive stroked cranks, special 
piston/cylinders, etc.

Is there an advantage of using the Type I in the Type III configuration 
versus the Type I engine in the Beetle configuration? Of course if it is 
what is on hand then that is advantage enough for me...

Remember the gearing will be higher on the Type IV engine bus tranny versus 
the Type I bus tranny. Might mean lower noise and lower rpms but might also 
lead to higher engine temps (low fan rpm) and lower power.
