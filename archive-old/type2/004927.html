Subject: Engine Door Seal

I believe I can answer two for one.
I bought a hatch seal for my 71 from Bus Depot.  One piece, was too large,
had to cut, but otherwise worked great.  My take on BD..Great price,
communication with operator leaves a little to be desired.  Can't wait till
Ron makes enough to put in an inventory management piece, so we can find out
if item is in/out of stock while on the phone.
My opinion only.
