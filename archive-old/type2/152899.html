Subject: help with a diagnosis.

I'm feeling a bit helpless right now.

After I dropped the wife off at work today I noticed that the battery 
light was glowing a dim red.  I pulled over and flipping through the 
muir manual became lost in it's explanations.  I couldn't even figure 
out what a regulator looks like or where is should be mounted using the 
bentley manual.

I think my regulator is going out.  The light is going from dim, to 
flashing bright and dim, to being on not at all when driving.
If I let the van sit, the gauge lights gone on as they should, then off 
when the engine starts up.
When I shut the engine off, and turn the key a notch the oil light is 
on, the battery light off.  I've also had the oil light be on, and the 
battery light be dim.

then to top things off I turned a corner hard later today and the dim 
battery light went out... only to return dimly after 15 miles.

HELP!

I'm not sure where to go from here.  I don't know if I'm looking at a 
faulty alternator, regulator, or if I just have a loose wire somewhere. 
  The last thing I did to the engine (yesterday) was to install new 
points, rotor, and dist cap.   If I can't figure it out by morning, 
then I'll have to drive it to the shop and have them fix it.
