Subject: [T2] Shock ? Answered

Well, it seems the new shocks did come with spacers, but where packed in
the other box I hadn't opened yet. Now, only one spacer is required per
shock, and putting two spacers in only one box seems to me to be relying a
whole lot on the guy behind the counter grabbing a matched pair.  Anyway,
all's well, new shocks are on, put the calipers and pads back on tonight as
well. Hooking the brake lines up Saturday and bleeding the brakes, and my
axle beam replacement will be done!! It isn't tagged yet, but what the
hell, I live out in the country, I'll just hang a sign on the back that
says &quot;farm use&quot; and hit the road!   Jeff S.
