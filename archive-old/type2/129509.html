Subject: Re: [T2] fog light switch?

Hi Volks!

&gt; Folks that have added fog lights, what have you used for a switch?

Original VW Bus fog light switch.  Looks like a
four-way flasher switch, but with two switched 
positions (head and tail) and with a yellow window
with the appropriate symbol on it, lighting up
together with the 2nd &quot;on&quot; position, which is the
fog taillight.  Not a common item, but I've seen 
several on German swap meets since.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
