heck I have been using a BIG pipe wrench for about 20 years. never had any
problems on or off.  and if you need to do some plumbing repairs around
the house you got the tool.    I think mine is a 15inch one but as long as
it opens up wide enough your good to go,   breaker bar, sledge hammer,
jumping on it all work, this is one part that does not have to be &quot;Too&quot;
precise just as long as it's not too loose.
  and it has never mussed up a nut either
