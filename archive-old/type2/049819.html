Subject: [T2] door lube-

Gentlepersons-
                       With yesterday's 60 degree temps and this morning's 
low 30's, coupled
with rain, the doors on my bus were frozen shut. Anybody have a solution/lube 
to pre-
vent this from happening? I'd prefer not to rip the gaskets when these temp 
swings
cause the moisture to freeze. And, yes, I used a variable heat gun to defrost 
the per-
imeter of the door before opening it; but there's gotta be a better way...
