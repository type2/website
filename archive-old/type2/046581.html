Subject: Re: [T2] 72 Westy color  L90D pastel white or L567 ivory?

Vincent Molenaar sends:

&gt; One more thing about the colors. You can really tell Pastell White and
&gt; Ivory appart. Pastell White really IS white, Ivory is much more yellow,
&gt; something like a newspaper that has been in the sun too long.

Off subject just a bit...who thinks of these names? *Pastel* White? You
can't get much more pastel than white!
