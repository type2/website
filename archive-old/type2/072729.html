Travis:

If you were driving a solid lifter vehicle, I would say check your valve
clearances.  Maybe you should any  way.  Sometimes this happens when a
lifter pumps up to high.

Was this a warm engine compression check?   Did you squirt oil in the
cylinders and recheck? (valves or ring problem)

Other than the % variation, the low numbers are still within range.

Have fun

&gt;Hello All --
&gt;Well, my 79 had her compression checked today and I have mixed emotions
&gt;about the results.  She's been running like a champ and quite smoothly,
&gt;indicates no significant oil usage, and I haven't been sensing any power
&gt;loss.  The readings were as follows:
&gt;
&gt;#1: 110
&gt;#2: 100
&gt;#3: 115
&gt;#4: 130
&gt;
&gt;I must admit that I found these numbers a little unnerving to say the
&gt;least, comparing them with the last reading I had, which was about 6 months
&gt;ago:  115, 120, 120, 135.  The low reading in #2 concerns me, as does the
&gt;range between highest and lowest.  I'm looking for anybody's best
&gt;educated/informed opinions as to the interpretation of these numbers --
&gt;what do you think?  Isn't 100 close to pushing it on the low side?  Am I
&gt;facing problems/repair soon or down the road, or are these even cause for
&gt;worry?  I know they're pretty much within spec, but they also seem on the
&gt;&quot;verge&quot; of something.  Thanks for your time and responses.
