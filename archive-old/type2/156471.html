Subject: RE: Where are all the Busses?

Hi

I was a previous member of the Type2 club, and my bus
is not much to speak of now but here it is.  I live in
Deatsville Alabama (near Montgomery) and I am in the
process to getting it in running order.  I work in a
military base (Gunter Annex) in Montgomery in a
computer place called the Blockhouse.  Why is that
significant? Well, three of the four original owners
of the bus work there too!  It has lived in England,
Germany, Greece and have been driven though every
country in between.

One owner, while in England found an ammo counter off
an old WWII British fighter plane and mounted it in
the spot for the clock.  Only problem was when he sold
it he nearly cried cause he couldn't get it out.  When
I dismantled it I mentioned it to his wife (she works
with him too) she then told me of the history.  I
pulled it out and gave it to him.  When he asked how
much I wanted for it(?), I just told him I can't sell
something that doesn't belong to me and gave it back. 
 I just found out that he put it in a bracket in his
'74 Bug!  The legend lives on!  

Once I am ready to paint I am looking at two colors. 
One, the more traditional is Hooters Orange with a
white top.  The second is all brown, top and bottom
with the front foot or so all grey and the front with
spots of orange by the lights and grill.  With the
proper band it would make a nice cigar! What do ya
think!  

I would send a photo of it but since it got rejected
three times I figure it aint going to happen.


Stan
