Subject: Air Horn

The electric horn on my 76 Westy became reluctant to make any noise at all 
an untold number of years ago. At the local hardware, I obtained a 
hand-held gas operated air horn normally used by boaters and 
football/baseball enthusiasts. When I need a horn, I just poke it out the 
driver window and trigger the briefest  blast that can be managed....sort 
of a bleeep.  Don't know if such equipment meets the legal requirement for 
Ohio, but that is what I am doing.

I probably toot that air horn once or twice each year. This is not one of 
those occassions.

Comments appreciated.
