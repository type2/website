Subject: Trip Report, was RMMWTrailer hitch for my bus
Content-Disposition: inline

I meant to post this trip report a lot earlier but now with this talk about trailer hitches, I finally have to do it.

First of all, three bumper bolts is OK ....

Last weekend I picked up a '59 Opel in Minnesota (1,400 miles each way from DC). The drive there was pretty unspectacular. I cruised at 75 - 80 and averaged about 18 mpg towing an empty tow dolly ('79 2L, FI, fairly high miles), took us 28 hours (with breaks) to get there.
The ride back home was a lot easier than I thought (but still hellish). I needed neither my tools nor the Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, or Minnesota AIRS lists. Towing the Opel, we cruised at  55 to 65 (OK, a lot slower in the Pennsylvania mountains), gas milage was around 16 mpg. The return trip took about 36 hours (due to slower speed and more frequent stops).
Some lessons I took out of this:
- a tow dolly is suitable for long distance driving. If you know how to drive with a trailer you should be fine with the dolly. If you never did any towing, stay away from the dolly because it tends to fish-tail a lot easier.
- Contrary to the sentiment on the Opel list, the camper is not underpowered to this kind of towing.
- 3 bumper mounting bolts are enough .... My PO-home-made-hitch uses modified bumper mounting brackets and one of the mounting bolts snapped when I removed the engine the last time.
- I'll never do a 2800 mile trip in a weekend again. It's doable, but no fun ...

I would not trust too much on the RMMW hitch. OEM hitches attach to frame rails (replacing the bumper brackets) and have an approx. 2.5&quot; heavy beam running behind the rear bumper. I would not trust into the bumper or engine mount to handle any serious weight.

    From that picture, I noticed that the bus hitch has a squared off bracket
on the forward end of it (I'm assuming that the bus hitch is the lower one in
the picture).  This is very interesting to me, because my bus, on the
crossbar under the engine, has that exact same threaded bracket on it, which
dangles there doing nothing but collecting oil.  I haven't removed it because
i didn't want to take the crossbar off.  Too bad my bumper is only held on by
three bolts (due to the fact that the fourth hole is no longer with us), or
I'd buy one.
