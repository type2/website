Subject: RE: [T2] Should I use this new harness???

Hey Don...

Rat nest indeed.....

I did rewire mine at the end of the summer... If you are handy with
electrical, you should have no problems... The best tip I could give you
is;

Take your time and do the wire 1 By 1.

You'll know where they go and if you ever have to redo them again.. It
will be easier... I also colored my Book with my wires colors, so I know
witch one is witch one for my van... (might not be good if you have many
vans.

Then you should not have to de-bug anything... But make sure you do it
right and man you need to be patient with this stuff... Good thing to do
while you have shoulder problem...

Cheers

Patrick
