I have tried very very hard to stop my engine's oil leaks, but im losing hope
fast.  Oil doesnt just drip from my '77 bus, it pours and sprays.  Oil ends
up all over everything.  The bottom of the engine, the sides, the top, over
everything.  The overspray is ruining the rear of my buses body fast.  Please
send me any suggestions.
