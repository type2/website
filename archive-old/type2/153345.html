Subject: leaky carburator

I have dual Weber carbs on a 1800 type IV engine (bus).  They are not the
original,  but nothing special (34mm).  The carb on the passengers side leaks
fuel, not tons, but the carb body is often wet with it.  I also get a strong
fuel smell.  I'm pretty sure that the fuel hoses are too large.  They will all
be changed as per Ratwell's article.

Any good articles on how to fix this?  Any thoughts?  Stuck float, needle
valve, etc.  The Weber manual I have is more about advanced tuning and
jetting.  I am also going to check the fuel filler neck, another known fuel
smell culprit.  Performance has always been great with these.

Thanks for the help.
