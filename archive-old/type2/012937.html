&gt; I have been thinking about the functionality of the Westy icebox unit 
&gt; in the 68 to 73 campers. Please share you experiences and ideas for 
&gt; making it work. What works best:dry ice, dry ice, frozen ziplock bags 
&gt; of ice, use the ice box for dry storage :) ?
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, many folks just remove theirs and perhaps for good reason but I 
&gt; want to make a go of it.

Chris,

I use a large block of ice in the ice try (wish someone made a replacement part as it's getting worn out). That worked to keep frozen idems frozen for about 48hours and kept everything else cold too.
I did have a probem with water leaking from drain hose(from ice try) into unit but I'm sure I can fix that.  I personally like this ice box set-up with sink. I like th rear facing sit behind driver's seat.  

Take Care
