Subject: [T2] Fuel smell and replacing rubber filler neck

Hello all,

I'm having a strong smell of fuel in my bus (2l, stock carbs) that is
worrying me. I've replaced all fuel lines, all the accessible (without
removing engine and tank) rubber parts on the vent system, but the smell
won't go away. Having some spare time at the weekend, I double checked
everything and I think I figured out what's happening (please correct me
if I'm wrong):

Symptoms:
Fuel smell in bus when turning sharp left. Stopped immediatly and found
gas on the inside of the gas cap, but not leaking outside.

Possible cause:
Rubber elbow (part number 1 on this fiche:
http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/Microfiche/t202110.gif) cracked at the
top. So apparently when doing left turns, gas is flowing towards the gas
cap and escaping through the crack in the top of the rubber elbow,
causing strong smell of fuel inside the bus.

Question:
Since I currently have no way to drop the engine, remove the tank and do
this job properly, I want to do this with the engine installed.
- Can I remove the firewall this way (removing carbs and air intake)?
- Will I have enough space to replace the hose from the tank to the
metal filler pipe? I think it is not leaking, but I want to replace it
anyway.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Cheers,

Timo
