Hi Rick,
	 I found that this wasn't a problem because the Merc rims needed 
spacers to correct the offset. The bolt-heads you describe are only a few
mm thick and it's quite easy to clearance the spacers to go over them.

 I don't think they are essential, anyway- their job is to keep the brake
drum on the hub, which is done by the wheel nuts anyway. It's possible that
your drums would fall off when you went to change a wheel but personally I
doubt it- the things tend to be a pig to get off when the bolts are removed
for servicing!

 Anyone know better? Is there a crucial role that I'm unaware of?

Cheers,
	W.
