Subject: Re: [T2] 82 Westy Timing

From Chuck:

Thanks for the offers of help.  Now that the timing scale is found and  set
to specs the Westy passed smog with flying colors and all emission readings were way below max allowed. 
Setting the timing at the specified 7.5  degrees ATDC has a noticeable effect on power at higher speeds but 
the technician told me that if I advance it back to the level of the  previous owners I would destroy the #3 
cylinder.  (sure enough, the previous owners replaced #3 cylinder 40,000 miles ago and new heads 9,000  miles 
ago).  Is there a happy medium or should I just get used to getting  the middle finger salute all the time as 
I try to get up to speed? (average speed of traffic in San Diego is somewhere between 70 and 90 depending on 
Red  Bull consumption)

Whoa!!    Is that a typo?  Or did he really set your timing at 7.5 AFTER?

Is this a Calif or Fed version Vanagon?

Calif version has true electronic ignition and times at 5 AFTER.

Fed version has points and times at 7.5 BEFORE.

IF you have a Cal version, it must have a dual vacuum unit on the distributor. Does it?

If yes, at idle disconnect the inboard vacuum line [the one on the flat inner side of the vacuum unit]. Does 
the idle speed increase? Is there vacuum at that hose? NO to both questions means you are severely retarding 
that engine at 7.5 after and your smog 'tech' is no tech, just a paper reader.
