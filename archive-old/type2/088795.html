 Someone asked about in dash  CD players.
I just put an Aiawa CDC-X927M in the dash of=20
my 70' Kombi. I am happy with it's fit and operation.
 I had trouble with older models that didn't like the=20
angle of the dash, or the firm ride of the bus.
(I'm betting that the technology has gotten to the
point that most new units won't skip)
 This model doesn't skip, even over RR tracks
in 3rd gear! It also comes with a cute little remote,
for control from bed.

 Question for electrician types:
-----------------------------------------------

Normally I wire digital stereos into a constantly hot circuit
so that it won't lose programs, and I don't have to have
the ignition on to hear NPR.
However, this stereo performs some gymnastic maneuvers
when the key is turned off, (kind of swallows it's face for
security reasons).=20
 Is it bad for the Pertronics points eliminator system to
be left on for long periods?
 If so, could I swap out the ignition switch with a later
model with an accessory position?

Jako 70' Kombi   =20
