Subject: the 74 Bus for sale

Hey Y'all,
  I sent a post about My 74 Sunroof Bus that is for sale and have had a 
lot of responses to it but I neglected to tell you where I live. So here 
is all the info that I know about the Bus at this time. I will have it 
at my home today so if anyone has more questions feel free to ask.
  Its a 74 sunroof pasenger bus type IV engine with dual Solex carbs. 
The body is O.K. no rust on the outside with a large but not too deep 
dent running from foward of the left rear tire to the back nut not 
touching the tail light. And the sun roof is dented up.  It has white 
spoke rims. It does not run yet but I have not tried to start it, it 
will be at my house today (friday) and I will try to make it run. The 
engine is all there and turns over by hand so it may run. the interior 
is not so good. There is no headliner. the middle seat is gone but the 
remaining seats are pretty good. The dash is all there but has a lot of 
little holes in it, like from a pencil.  It had a camper kit in it at 
one time but is gone now and did not have a pop up. Threre is one rust 
spot one the inside on the floor in the back about 6in from the sliding 
door, very easy fix. It is about 2in x 8in. It also has two horizontal 
slat type camper windows(three slats crank open), one in the door and 
one opposit the door.
  I was going to sell it as a whole Bus but will consider parting it out 
if I have enough interest. It is located in the Tacoma area. The price 
will be $400 or $500 if it runs good or best offer, so if you are 
interested let me know, come look at it and make me an offer.
I realy need to get it out of the yard as soon as possible
