Subject: RE: [T2] Eastern NC Junkyards

Written by: &quot;Sharpe, Steven&quot; &lt;sharpes_at_uncw_dot_edu&gt;

&gt;Anybody know of any good junkyards in eastern NC?
&gt;Central NC?
&gt;NE SC?

Steve,
     This is a very good question. I knew of a few around the Charlotte to 
Statesville area but they seem to have been disappearing the past few years. 
One just 4 weeks ago. I hear there is a nice Type II and others yard in 
Hickory but that is heading farther to the west. I am very interested in 
what the list might have on this one. Hey guys help us out Tarheels in 
search of parts. Don't be stingey spread the love, no horders aloud....as 
long as I get there first. LOL.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
