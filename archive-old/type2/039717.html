Doktor Tim,

As always, your insight is MUCH appreciated on this list!  (even if the truth 
hurts sometimes).  Too much of what is considered VW maintenance and 
restoration is in reality myth, lore, legend and slick marketing.

Thanks again for the ongoing course in automotive engineering, basic physics 
and just plain common sense.
