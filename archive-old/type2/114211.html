Subject: Re: [T2] oil filter removal tool

	Barry, Teri, Dave, Richard, Joel 'n friends in List-Landia...

	I recall getting a cam-operated, gripper jaw, finger-like thingie
for removing the filters on 914s (where the cast iron &quot;moustache&quot; bar REALLY
interferes with filter access), at Sears, or maybe it was a really GOOD auto
parts store.  It's been years since I bought it - there's two gripper
fingers that &quot;cam down&quot; and the harder you turn it, the tighter they grip
the filter...  There's a 1/2&quot; drive hole in the big hex-bar end of it, or
you can also grab it and twist using a crescent wrench.

	I still need it for the 914 and now the '73 Deluxe, but since I
added the 72 plate cooler, the oil filter on the '72 is relocated and is
readily hand &quot;twist-able&quot;...

	Hoping that helps somebody!
