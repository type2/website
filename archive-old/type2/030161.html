Michael,

First, on controlling the voltage, the amount of time the points are open
determines how long electricity feeds to the coil and condensor to
&quot;charge&quot; them. Like all systems involving a condensor/ capacitor, if you
hook it to DC, it charges and then sits.  You have to discharge it and
reload it to get current flow.  The rating of the condensor/capacitor
determines how much it can store.  As I understand it, when the points are
open, the electrons flow into the condensor, which stores them until the
points close.  At that point, all the electrons rush to the coil and are
transformed into high voltage, come back down the HT lead to the center of
the distributor cap and are led by the rotor to the correct spark plug HT
lead.  So you need enough time for the electrons to charge the capacitor
and enough time for the capacitor to discharge into the coil.  Electrical
genii have determined that the correct ratio is 40/50 and I just accept
that... think &quot;magic&quot; :-)

I don't *realllly* undestand this myself, and would love to hear the story
of Mr. Electron on his way from his home in The Battery to his office in
Spark Plug Center (sometimes I need it laid out in truly basic form :-)

Second, on directly measuring the dwell angle... Yes, you could, if you
had a T1 engine and a degree wheel pulley. AFAIK, no one makes a degree
fan or ring for a T4.  That would, as a matter of fact, be the most
precise and only direct way of measuring the dwell angle.

With a dwell meter, you are still using a proxy, which is as follows: The
alternator puts out a nominal voltage (12v on a bus), if the points are
closed all the time, then the voltage at the points is that nominal
voltage. If they are open all the time, then it is 0.  When dist spins and
opens and closes the points, you get a fractional voltage (if the lag on
your meter is long enough :).  If you calibrate it in degrees of dwell,
then you have an excellent proxy.

BTW, if you don't have a dwell meter, but you do have a voltmeter, you can
figure out that the average voltage for 50 degrees of dwell is:

50 (degrees of dwell desired)/90 (degrees in 1/4 of a circle) times 12
(your nominal voltage)

or 5/9 (both numbers divided by 10) times 12

or 6.66... volts.

This only works if you *don't* have a really good meter...  If you do, the
reading will flicker between 0 and 12 which is perfectly true and
perfectly useless :-) Don't worry, very few meters are that good :-)

Final note from Mr. Dyslexic... I have beat my brains for half an hour
trying to get the open vs. closed right, and I still cannot figure out if
I did :-( If I have reversed open vs. closed, *PLEASE* post!
