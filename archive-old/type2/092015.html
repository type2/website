&gt; Hello.
&gt;
&gt; I am not familiar with the wheel mount you are describing.
&gt;
&gt; I have a custom made wheel mount that does connect to the front bumper, but
&gt; most front wheel mounts are screwed into the metal skin with six (or more)
&gt; metal screws.
&gt;

Nope just two in the metal skin of the front, right under the vent air intake
grille, and two to the bumper.

&gt;
&gt; On your problem . . .
&gt;
&gt; 1)  could you get some sort of vice grip onto the spining nut??  If you can
&gt; get a grip on it, then you might be able to remove the bolt/screw from the
&gt; front.
&gt;

Well yeah I could but I guess I have to remove the dashboard and everything. :-)

&gt;
&gt; I had the same condition; a loose nut just under the fresh air vent.  I 'J B
&gt; Weld' the nut to the skin on the inside.
&gt;

What's JB Weld?

&gt;
&gt; Actually, I 'J B Welded' the nut to a large fender washer while it was on my
&gt; work bench.  The next day, when it was cured, I 'J B Welded' the  washer
&gt; with attached nut to the skin.
&gt;
&gt; I was very careful NOT to get any of the 'J B Weld' in the threads of the
&gt; nut or the threads of the bolt.
&gt;

Thanks for the tips Barry, gotta get back working now...
