Steve, on my 79 it's on the front left hand side of the trans. However, this
was an option on mine which I fitted later. You may just find a blanking
plug.

Also have you checked to see if you've actually got  bulb holders under  the
lens covers?

Q B Auto Camp and others do a kit - try Volksworld for the number.

You can live without it for a while though so get going.
