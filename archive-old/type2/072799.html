Subject: Engine Cases


The recent FART thread regarding type I vs type IV engines raises a
recurring curiousity for me.  Various discussiuons in past months infer
that engine cases are not all created equal.  From campfire experiences I
know that the typical (German) type I engine case is cast of an aluminum
alloy that contains a significant percentage of magnesium.  I've also heard
talk of other engine cases (type IV and possibly the beetlemex type I)
being cast entirely of aluminum.  Now I know that magnesium is often used
to create lighter alloys.  Is there a knowledgeable type out there who can
explain the differences and relative advantages/disadvantages of aluminum
vs magnesium alloy engine cases???
