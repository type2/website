The Alternator has a larger out Diameter at the rear, so it hits the older
style fuel pump. It is possible to use a Gen pump with an alternator(I am
currently) but not all Gen pumps can be used. You may have to slightly dent
the top to allow it to clear. The biggest problem is not the fit, its
getting the dang thing out if it fails. If you have a Gen pump with an Alt.
you must undo the Alt so you can lift it up to allow clearance to remove the
pump. It works, but a major PITA. If you have to buy a new pump anyway, get
the right one. And, make sure you get the push rod for the right pump, they
are different. (Alt one is shorter buy about 3/8in) BTW you can cut down the
Gen rod to fit, but I do not remember the exact length off hand.

Why is there a different fuel pump for the 1600 DP depending on whether
you have an alternator or generator?  Is one interchangeable with the
other?
