Subject: RE: [T2] Brazilian VW Bus - racist term??

I'm all in favor of this -- especially since it applies to BOTH sides of the
political spectrum and includes &quot;holier than thou&quot; and self-appointed
&quot;Political Officers&quot;.

The term is generally considered racist and using it here opens up a
political argument, OBVIOUSLY, because it has, and politics that have
nothing to do with busses have nothing to do with this list, as far as I am
concerned, just to be safe in this SOCIETY avoid terms that are not
acceptable in the non-virtual society and we can all get along without the
hateful politics.

Would you use that term at work?

I have done my best to not reveal how I actually feel about this term or
politics, we should all do the same, in my opinion, again, of course
