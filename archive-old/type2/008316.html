&gt;You can get a Catalytic Safety heater that runs off of propane gas,
&gt;designed for RVs and boats that will heat 1600 to 2800 BTUs designed 
for
&gt;110 square feet for $240!
&gt;
&gt;Not only did the price sound good but consider this:
&gt;- No moving parts, not even a fan
&gt;(no jet engine sound in the middle of the night camping)
&gt;- No smell
&gt;- Fully adjustable
&gt;- 100% safety shut-off valve
&gt;- you can hang it on the wall either horizontally or vertically
&gt;

I had a friend in eastern washington not so long ago who couldn't get 
warm with his catalytic wall mount heater. It is radiant heat so it 
heated what was around him, but not HIM. His windows still had ice, and 
he was cold. It was about 0 to 10 degrees outside.
On the other hand I have a radient heater, and a friend has a gas bus 
heater. When his heater is on, a warm 70 degrees all around the bus is 
norm, and when mine is on the bus get so hot, I open windows even down 
to way below freezing. Think twice about discounting the gas heater, or 
radient heaters.
