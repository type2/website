Subject: Re: [T2] deluxe from Berkeley, broken on bay bridge last night?

&gt; We vintage Volks are a very misunderstood breed.

After my father and I got my engine back together and in the bus over the
holidays, I took the bus out for a test run. I was about 2 miles from my
parents house, about to pull into a gas station with a cop pulled me over for
a taillight out. I told him a wire must have come loose when we put the engine
in and that I'd check it when I got to the gas station (I thought about
checking it right on the spot, but figured I'd be taking to great a chance of
getting shot if I jumped out of the bus...).

The cop let me go with a warning but not until after he asked me &quot;Is there
anything in there you want to tell me about? Any drugs, contraband, anthrax,
bombs?&quot;

I could understand the drugs and contraband, but anthrax? bombs?

Realize too, my bus is painted RED, WHITE and BLUE!

-Eric
