Subject: Re: bus middle seat - will '77 fit '71?

&gt; I have the middle seat out of my '77 because I installed a Westy
&gt; interior.  If you want it, and it'll fit a '71, let me know.

I'm sure more than a few listees know, but I'm clueless...are middle
bench seats interchangeable between a '77 and a '71?

Thanks!

- Miles
