It does make sense.  I use the same rationale for flat washers, but never
thought of it for those circlips.  I'm sure there are a lot of things that I
didn't do according to standard.  Many of which I have found myself doing
over.  Today's task is to clearance the generator pulley so it doesn't rub
on the generator and make that horrible noise...

Ah, memories of rebuilding my 71 back around 79 in the lab storeroom...
The circlips for the wrist pins of the pistons to the rods- did you 
notice if one side has a &quot;rounded&quot; edge and the other a sharp edge due 
to how they are stamped out?  The anal mechanics told me to put the 
rounded edge on the pin side....
