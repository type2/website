Subject: RE: [T2] 6-rib transmission swap (long)

Hey Mark,

 

I have the same low head-temps but high oil-temp issues like Will. What
exactly do you mean by a Porsche gen. pulley? The whole Porsche center
mounted cooling system, or something else?

 

Curiously yours,

 

Jon Stiles

F.  I'm going to install an RX7 oil cooler/thermostat for next summer's
travels.  I'm not finished experimenting, would like to try some 1.25 ratio
rockers, and someday build a 1914.

hello Will I agree with you on the heads.   for your oil temps try a porsche
gen. pulley. kinda costly but really does the job. lowered my oil temps on
my 1904cc motor by about 10to15 degrees.  later   mark d
