Subject: &quot;Lorax&quot; the `80 vanagon

Hey Now,
 
 I'm kinda new to the list but I've been watchin'
I got the Lorax from some dude who worked at a garage but never took
time out for it. He drove Lorax all around the country and never changed
the valve cover gasket and whatever else...
I think I have gotten a deal, like three spots of rust ( I'm east coast)
and great interior. So I've been hanging on for a year or so trying to
educate before anyone touches it. I ve met this dude that says he knows
but I really want a 2nd opinoin...
If any one is interested in consoling me please....
