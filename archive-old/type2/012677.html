&gt;I don't fully understand his reasons, but I understand what he is asking.
&gt;So I will be taking down the archives.

Hmm. I think I can tell you why. Quite some time back there was 
discussion of selling cds of the archives, to fund the list. Quite a few 
folks pointed out that A: they owned the rights to what they had written; 
and B: they hadn't given anybody permission to sell them for financial 
gain-even for the non-profit support of the list. As I recall, Bob Hoover 
was one of the louder ones of the bunch-and his comments were arguably 
some of the most valuable. The fallout of all this was the removal of 
Hoover's sermons from the t2 website. Not because Hoover didn't trust 
Ken, but rather because other websites were stealing the content and 
providing it without attribution. At the time, the general consensus was 
that there was no way permission could ever be gained from all of the 
persons whose work would be in the cd. Since the job of trying to get 
permission from all of these people was not possible, there were two 
options. 1. publish it, and risk being sued or some such on down the 
line, or 2. don't do it. Obviously the choice at the time was #2.

I don't think it's anything personal. I'd say it's more a case of Ken 
trying to cover his ass in an extremely litigious society. Because of his 
historical involvement with the list, were the archives published in some 
sort of non-free form (I know your time and DB skills aren't free, but 
you're not charging visitors for them, that's the key), Ken would likely 
be named in a lawsuit. As for the issue of them being an online 
searchable archive, I'd expect it's ok because of the precedent set by 
internet newsgroups. When you post to a public place, you are assumed to 
know that your posts could be included in a free online collaboration.

Disclaimers: IANAL, and my recollections could have some factual errors, 
as I believe all of the events I'm mentioning occurred something like 5-6 
years ago. I do however think the above is relatively close to historical 
fact, close enough to gain a general 10,000 foot view...


Peace,
