Subject: Hall effect distributor - Vanagon

I have a vanagon with a hall effect (electronic ignition) distributor.
The vacuum advance is sticky and I need to disassemble the unit
to clean and grease it. I took off the circlip above the hall sheild
(That upside down can with 4 notches in it) but cannot get it off of
the shaft.

I was speaking with H. Steve (Hi H.!) this evening and we both agreed
that the shield should slide up off. The Bently shows two screwdrivers
walking it off of the shaft, but I pushed on them kinda hard and it
did not budge.

Has anyone else done this? Am I missing somthing, should I push
harder, what will help? I wiggled and tried to rock the unit
back and forth but it did not budge .001 inch.

Any tips? (I love having the list back, I am trying to get my
new Vanagon to pass emissions (dual carb, euro model)
and I think that this is the problem.
