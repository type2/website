Subject: two volkswagon bus for sale

hey my name is Rory Jensen im from Yakima, Washington state and i have 2 volkswagon Buses for sale i have a 1974 and a 1971 that are both in good shape as in the body in the 1974 the motor is blown but i have it takin a part and all that it needs is a crank it has the websters carborator and is a nice motor if rebuilt the transmision is great and has low miles this bus would be a nice bus to have and to drive around. Now on the 1971 its a great lil bus i have had it for 2 years and was a blast to drive but i ended up breakin the axle in the back and i had to get a truck for my work so im selling it too the bus has maybe 4 dents in it that are easly fixed motor runs great just changed the oil the inside of the bus is nice and clean. I would like to sell the 1974 for 150$ and the 1971 for 400$ they are great to have and if you know anyone taht is interested in them please tell me or e-mail me back thank you very much 

Rory Jensen
