HELP!

After putting the bus back together this weekend, I still have the
problem with the rear lights....

Here's the spec;

- - when I put on the head lights, nothing comes on at the rear
- - the horn works fine
- - the brake lights do not come on at all
- - the bus is a late '67 bay (one of the first I believe), and as such
does not have reverse lights
- - now here's the crunch...as soon as I indicate, the number 1 fuse goes!

I really need some help on this...not much of a clue when it comes to
electricity!  Obviously I cannot drive the bus without at least the
rear/brake lights working....

An man, do I want to drive her!

Hope you can advise,

Thanks in anticipation,

Jonathan.
