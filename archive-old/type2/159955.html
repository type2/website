Subject: '68 Wiper Arm and 9-prong Flasher Relay

Hello Y'all, I am looking for a wiper arm to fit a 1968 Bay. I know,
they are one year only unobtainium, but I seem to remember someone on
the list found a '68 at a wrecking yard, and I'm hoping for the best.
Also, I was looking for a 9-prong flasher relay for that same year and
found one. Wolfsburg West is selling new repro versions of this for $54
!  A score compared to the $200+ NOS ones I've seen listed! I hope this
helps someone out, I've sold two here on the island already. Two more
classics back on the road, YES!  Aloha, Timo dba Forever Endeavor
