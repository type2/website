&gt;Both the Vanagon engines I have torn down (well.... one's partially

&gt;down at the pickup end.

That is just the oil pickup tube assembly, which all engines absoultely
must have.  The windage tray is a separate, different part from that.  The
books do mention it but I have never seen one, and nobody I know has one in
their engine.  Bottom line, I wouldn't worry about it being missing.
