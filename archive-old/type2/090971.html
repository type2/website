Subject: Re: [T2] heater smells

It isn't supposed to smell at all. Lets see 2002 - 1971 that's 31 years.
A little of everything has been through your system.
You can dis connect the heater tubes to your interior and address this
again when your brain cells replenish.
I always disconnect my heater tubes and tie up the flappers in warm
months because heat always comes in past the highly efficient, expertly
designed premium flapper valves.
