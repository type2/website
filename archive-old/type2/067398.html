Our lead mechanic here at &quot;busbones&quot; has been monitoring the list from
over my shoulder for the last few months. (soon to &quot;enroll&quot;  once we get
our Net adresses resolved) He's quite impressed with the overall use
of the list (&quot;Darn impressive, those folks!&quot;) and the genuine enthusiasm
we busfolk show towards our mechanical steeds. (&quot;If these folks hadda
been MY customers 30 years ago I'dda never retired!&quot;)

We're gonna miss him when he takes his vacation in December for those
two crazy weeks before Christmas, but we understand and wish him well
as he trundles down to South Florida in his battered 71 bus for his annual 
stint as our favorite white-bearded guy.

He's 77 years young.... 

btw, he holds the shop record for pulling a FI Bus motor. 18.2 minutes!
