Subject: Re: [T2] Oil pump for type IV Whose to Use

I think I understand that TypeI pumps can be used in TypeIV engines (don't
hold me to this) and it sounds like perhaps that's what Aircooled_dot_net is
offering.  But the most common cause of low oil pressure is plain wear and
tear on the engine's bearings.  The oil pump lives in a pretty benign
environment and, absent abuse, generally lasts longer than the rest of the
engine.  It's not clear from your post whether you're thinking a new oil
pump alone will solve your problems or if this search is associated with a
planned rebuild.

I've rebuilt 2 TypeIV engines and in both cases the oil pumps were fine and
performed satisfactorily in the rebuilt motors.

Subject: [T2] Oil pump for type IV Whose to Use


&gt; I am in need of a new oil pump for Possum and I did a little searching.
&gt; Aircooled_dot_net has some 30mm pumps they recommend for type 4. But they
&gt; mention something about high pressures when cold(200psi) and having to
&gt; maybe modify the oil pressre relief valve.[snip]
&gt; So then looked at Bus Depot, been pretty happy with Ron's
&gt; stuff. They list a Melling Pump for about $70.00. More than twice the pump
&gt; at Aircooled_dot_net but which one should I use? [snip]
&gt; I am getting low oil pressure when the bus
&gt; warms up at idle. Say 10-15 lbs at idle when oil temps are at 210-225.
&gt; Strong pressure on startup 60lbs. Running at 65-70mph when temps are in
the
&gt; 210-225 range I get about 25-30lbs sometimes less. I say thats not so
good?
