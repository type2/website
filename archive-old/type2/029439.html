&gt; I've seen a few posts on &quot;protecting you bus&quot; and have some ideas, but how
&gt; do people keep their bus theirs?  I have been considering a fancy alarm that
&gt; just kills the ignition.  Obviously, it could do a lot more, but I'm just
&gt; looking for ways to prevent the vehichle from being started up.  I have a
&gt; locking engine lid,

The best protection would be a vicious rottwieler tied to the front bumper
with a 25 foot rope.  This would also prevent door dings in parking lots!

Seriously, against a pro thief you have little chance.  They drive up in a
flatbed tow truck and load it up.  Even with the alarm wailing and the
locked wheels sliding up the ramp nobody seems to pay any attention.
After all, they have a tow truck so they must be legitimate, right?

The casual thief is another matter.  Ignition kill switches hidden in
various places are useful, although if I were a thief I would carry a long
jumper wire to connect the battery to the coil, negating the kill switch.

Casual thieves are also put off by mechanical locks such as the &quot;club&quot; or
brake lock.  Pros simply cut through the steering wheel to remove these.

The best way, IMO, to protect against the drive-away thief is an electric
fuel cutoff valve.  This, combined with the hidden switch, allows you to
shut off your fuel supply at the tank.  The beauty of this is that the
thief will be able to start your bus, but it will shortly run out of gas
and stall.  The thief will be much less likely to puzzle out your security
system if he's sitting stalled in traffic. 

BTW, the one thing that pro thieves hate is obviously home-brewed alarm
systems.  These systems are unpredictable and who knows if some backyard
engineer might figure out how to incorporate pepper spray into the system!
