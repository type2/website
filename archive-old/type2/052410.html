Subject: [T2] lightened flywheels for hill country

say if a person with a type I- powered bus lived in a very hilly area like 
the ozarks or cascades and did most of their driving there...wouldn't it be 
a benefit to use a 12.5# flywheel with a counterweighted crank?  i realize 
the stock flywheel would be better for long flat hauls....where i live, 
there is like five 30 degree hills every mile....
