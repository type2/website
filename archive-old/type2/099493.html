Subject: Re: [T2] 79 tranny ? 72 tranny

'72 for power, '79 for highway cruising.

&gt;I have 2 trannys, one is a 72 bs trannt and the other is out of a 79. We are
&gt;putting in a 2.0l and want to know which would be better to use and what is
&gt;the gear differences. thanks to whom can respond. Dylan and Stephanie

If I was doing mostly hill climbing or back roads I would consider the '72. 
If I was doing alot of flat land or highway touring I would go with the '79.
