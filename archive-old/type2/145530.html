  not sure but you could also check with whiteys in fletcher NC.... cant remeber the name of his shop though but he has little odds and ends soemtimes... or maybe check with mark dearing at salemn imports in salemn virgina... if he dont have one he might be able to point you in the right direction....
good luck

Raby's Type4Store had some a while back. Might check there.
