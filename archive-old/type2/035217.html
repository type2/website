Subject: Re: Subject: Source for 2L heads?

&gt;You _can_ buy new heads from AMC Spain. Their reputation is that they
&gt;have the same tendancy to drop valve seats (or worse, depending on who you
&gt;ask; see the archives) as the original VW ones did.  Which makes the AVP
&gt;heads (which I sell) and Marc Stephens heads an improvement over them (for
&gt;less money), since they have a newer design that minimizes this problem. 


Someone pointed out a few months ago that the vast majority of heads 
coming out of AVP and MSHP have been welded. He further claimed that this 
reduces the life of the head well below that of a new head.

For the longest head life, the best route to go may be to get the new 
heads from Spain (at about $400 a pop) and send them to Marc Stephens for 
the valve seat treatment. 

But be aware that even Marc Stephens isn't perfect. David Schwarze and I 
have both gotten unsatisfactory heads from MSHP. Inspect thoroughly!
