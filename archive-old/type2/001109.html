Well Friday finally arrived, grin , We closed the shop for a much needed day
off and some de-stress time for me. I arrived and the campground shortly
after noon, was greeted with a few cheers and some looks of awe. the reason
being i finally after three years arrived in a VW, an ugly Thing but still a
VW and not a Ford. At that time there were already around 25 or 30 or so
buses at the grounds. I loafed around all afternoon shooting the bull and
meeting new folks as well as catching up with old friends from previous
campouts and such. I left around 7:30 pm as to try and get my butt home
before it got too cold ( note no top on the thing ). At the time i left
Chris had a total of 70 buses there, and a steady stream it seemed for the
most part still coming in.
On Sat i arrived at around 10:00 am to over a 100 buses there, what an
awesome sight, all forms and fashions and models of Type2's,,From Splitties
to Eurovans.  I spent most of the day goofing off again,, gotta love it.
Left around 2 pm for a field trip with Ted Finesman, and returned later with
my wife Shirley and grandbaby, Madison Jade &quot;Grumpy&quot; in tow. we wandered
through the grounds cking out the news arrivals, and showing off Grump,
located and cked out Emmet McGovern's splittie for scheduling for some metal
work, also cked out Steve Dolan's 67 Hardtop westy which he was bringing to
me for metalwork,,, wandered on farther up the circle of buses chatted a few
with Gene and Debbie Hickman . From there we then raided the potluck supper
deal ,, very good food floating around. we hung out till after the awards
were presented and such then Grumpy got rowdey and sleepy so we headed home.
Sun i had just entered the area of the campground and met Steve Dolan and
Sean Bartnik headed out in an attempt to find my place. I did a uie and lead
them through the senic country side backroads to the house and shop so they
could get on their way home. They got a .50 tour of a messy shop and yard
then headed home. ,, I want to thank Chris, Chad, Judy,Roy, Mad Dave, and
every one involved for the best EveryBus so far, and a job well done folks.
Now i'm looking forward to HighCountry Bus Festival in July ,,wohoooo road
trip ,,
ps some one please fill in the blanks of details i missed ,,later
