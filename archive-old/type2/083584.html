&gt; I don't have the owner's manual for my '77 bus. Anyone have a picture of the

Scott,

The whole wiring diagram for your bus is at:

http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/bus-77-78.jpg

Go there, download it or at least look at it.  Everywhere you see an &quot;S&quot;
with a number beside it...  those are your fuses and the number indicates
position in the fuse box.
