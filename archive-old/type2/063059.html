I put my Ford solenoid on the sheet metal behind (back is back) the voltage
regulator on the right side of the engine. Funny thing was that there were
two holes there already. Perhaps a PO had one there before? Anyway, it is
so unobtrusive that it almost looks like it belongs there. I have had a
solenoid on my bus for a couple of months and haven't had any starting
problems (before it only started half of the time). BTW, a bus can also be
push started by having a helper push it backwards while you pop the clutch
in reverse gear (you will quickly find out if you have it in second by
mistake).

Alternate location instead of drilling sheet metal is to attach the 
gizmo to the screw that holds the starter together.  I carefully 
removed the long screw, attached my Ford solenoid  &amp; wired it up on 
the bench, and had to bend the tang on the solenoid to clear the deck 
lid after installation though.  Sad that we still need solenoids, 
even on such a 'new' bus as an '80 *sigh*.
