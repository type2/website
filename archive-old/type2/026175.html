[...] I just went through the same thing this week, except the one I'm
parting out is a '69.  There is a little plastic piece in the end of the
metal tube, presumably to keep crap out of the tube.  Sometimes the little
bugger is hard to get out.

&gt; 
&gt; hi list - why does the left heater cable never want to come out form me.
&gt; i'm breaking down a 68 parts bus and once again i am stumped on that
&gt; cable.
&gt; seems like the tube in the rear is smaller, and the metal bit at the end
&gt; it
&gt; the cable never wants to pass through that tube. a yank on it it and it
&gt; jams up. opposite effect on the right side. heavens-to-betsy if i do get
&gt; it
&gt; out and i have to re-install someday. someone share the trickery?  - steve
