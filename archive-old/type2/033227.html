Hey everyone;

We went to Washington and had a beautiful weekend but our bus did not. 
My wife had taken it to Jiffy Lub to get an oil change two days before
our trip.  We made a stop right before we left and I noticed a huge
puddle of oil under the bus.  Those guys had dropped the oil screen.  My
mechanic said that he doesn't even drop that pan for a rebuild.  So when
they tried to tighten that old gasket back up it was no go and no one
had the part in stock since there is no call for it.  Ended up taking
the '77 bemmer.  Jiffy lub eventually got the gasket and the oil leak
stopped.  Moral either change the oil yourself or take it to a real
garage.  Maybe next time.
