Subject: newbie questions

I just joined this list on the prompting of a friend and I have a couple of 
questions:
1) What is meant by the Type2 , Type4 etc...?
2) I have an 82 Westy, what type is it?
3) Right now my Westy runs really strong but is pretty rough when cold.  Is 
that normal?  How long should I let is warm up?  
Thanks in advance for the direction and advice.
