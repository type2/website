Subject: Re: valve cover gaskets

&gt;

With all this talk of leaking VC and bails with no tension left etc, has anyone
found a source for the cast valve covers that bolt on...?

I have put many sets of these on Type I engines and they work very well...

Is there any vendor out there making/selling them for the Type IV engines...??
