Subject: Re: [T2] oils

Hello Guys  Just got back from another wet Manassas bug-out. Still had a good 
time and yes Adam there were some vintage rides there to be seen, Most of 
them were in the swap meet area :)  Seems like putting them in the show is just 
too much PITA  Don Haigt's dolled 51 bug was covered with everyadd on item you 
could dream of. Also more guys like myself vending out of splits,buses and 
trucks. way too many venders.  But to the subject  I have been running a test 59 
panel with a big 1835 stroker motor. I broke it in using st 30wt did OK but 
wanted to run too hot, changed to st 50 which helped some on the heat, then 
tried 15-50 diesel oil ran even hotter. went to 20-50 not much difference. I next 
tried 15-50 mobil 1 this lower the oil temp about 15 degrees . Next I added 
some home made pie pan scoops that I bolted thur the vents, didn't want to drill 
the panel these dropped at another 5 degrees. I'm now down to about 235F . 
still too hot for my liking , even tried leaving the rear deck open did nothing. 
 At this point I pulled the motor and put the flaps and therostat on and put 
a type 4 oil cooler  also changed the header to a type that was further from 
the full flow oil filter and wrapped the filter with header tape. now she runs 
in the range I can live with 225F max. I tried all of these test in a 4 year 
span running to Tenn. on I81 at 65-75mph fully loaded this is a 5 hour trip. My 
oil presure was also better with the mobil1 than any of the other oils I 
tested.  Just my own test take it as you want.  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  
salem Import Service  Salem Va Still running mobil1 except in my stock buses 
which I run st30 or 50wt .
