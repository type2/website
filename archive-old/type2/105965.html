If you have power brakes, the booster makes it much more difficult to
attach a tow bar.  If I were doing it, I would design a structure that
picks up the front beam as well as the bumper attach, and then put a
towbar pivot below or in front of the bumper.  A lot less scraping
problems that way, and you can fold the hitch upward for driving.

Of course, the cost of such a tow arrangement might be close to the cost
of a trailer!  If your tow vehicle can handle it, the trailer is the way
to go.  You might even buy one for the trip and then sell it after you're
done.
