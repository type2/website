Subject: Re: [T2] Broken fuel pump!

[...]

The alternator fuel pump rod should be 99.5mm long.
The new replacement fuel pump fittings are backwards. The top one is 'in'. The
bottom is 'out'. You may have the lines reversed...


&gt; Hey all!
&gt;
&gt; I was driving home the other day and my bus just
&gt; stopped.  I went round back and took a peek, finding
&gt; that the fuel pump had shattered into three or four
&gt; pieces.  I got it home, ordered a new pump, flange,
&gt; rod, and seals.  My engine is a 1600dp that I equiped
&gt; with a alternator.  I ordered the correct pump for a
&gt; car with an alternator as well as the correct rod.
&gt; When I got it all apart I found that the rod in the
&gt; car was bent, and considerably longer then the one I
&gt; got from RMMW.  I figured that I needed to put one
&gt; back in the engine that was the same as the one I took
&gt; out.  So I went to the autoparts store and got a new
&gt; rod that was as long as the one I took out of the bus.
&gt;  I got home and put it all back togeter again.  When I
&gt; tried to start it, nothing happend.  The engine turns
&gt; and turns but never fires.  I'm assuming that I'm
&gt; still not getting fuel.  I tried it with the smaller
&gt; rod just to see what would happen and still nothing.
&gt;
&gt; The only thing I'm not quite sure of is wether or not
&gt; I got the fuel hoses hooked to the appropriate places
&gt; on the pump.  Does the hose from the tank go the the
&gt; top hookup or the bottom hookup on the pump?  Any
&gt; other suggestions why she won't start?  Any Idea as to
&gt; what caused the old pump to fail so badly?  Also, any
&gt; comments on the pros and cons of using an electric
&gt; fuel pump in place of the mechanical one?
