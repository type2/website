Yes, you can do it. It's even a &quot;TUeV&quot;-approved procedure (Germany's
technology watchdog). But you'll need to weld in a triangle (about a 2&quot; base
and 4&quot; height) into the corner to restore some of structural integrity.

&gt; Is it safe to remove the steel panel behind the front seats on my '72
&gt; Sportsmobile?  I would like to install the swivel seat bases from a Westy to
&gt; open up the interior a bit when camping.  Did Westfalia do any kind of
&gt; structural reinforcements in this area when they did their conversions?  When
&gt; did VW quit putting these panels in '72-'79 buses, or are they in all
&gt; passenger vans?
