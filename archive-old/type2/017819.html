I apologize for the length of this message, but feel like the CARB
deserves to have &quot;airtime&quot;. Flame me privately, please.

&gt; Howdy. I wrote to you (helpline_at_arb_dot_ca_dot_gov) yesterday, and copied your
&gt; comments to me to the aircooled VW bus list I subscribe to. Here are
&gt; three comments from the list:
&gt;
&gt; Comment #1:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; If you would like someone to call you to discuss ARB programs
&gt; regarding
&gt; &gt; older vehicles, for example, our pilot program for accelerated vehicle
&gt; &gt; retirement in southern California, just let me know.
&gt;
&gt; Let's see, &quot;pilot program for accelerated vehicle retirement&quot;.  Sounds
&gt; to me like this just _might_ hint at an agenda of &quot;removing vehicles
&gt; from the roads&quot; and I really doubt that they are trying to retire 1999
&gt; Acuras!  A &quot;pilot program&quot;, if I know my bureaucracies, almost always
&gt; leads to a &quot;large-scale program&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Comment #2:
&gt;
&gt; what i found even more disturbing in reading the CARB info website is
&gt; that
&gt; to get credit for removing a vehicle it need to be destroyed 100% and NO
&gt; parts can be resold or reused. This, right after thery state how they
&gt; are
&gt; sensitive
&gt; about the concerns of collectors of vintage autos. They speak with
&gt; forked
&gt; tongues.

&gt;
&gt; Not even Body parts, which hardly contribute to air pollution?????

&gt; I think that there are some valid points in those three comments. A
&gt; genius acquaintance of mine has been developing a propane engine,
&gt; explaining that the government is hell-bent to remove old VWs from the
&gt; roads. I thought his point was extreme. Now I'm not so sure.
&gt;
&gt; He had some interesting stories about the propane supply here in San
&gt; Diego -- apparently &quot;alternate fuel&quot; vehicles make for good tax breaks,
&gt; but his trying to obtain information and fuel for vehicular use was met
&gt; with a stonewall at every turn -- basically the program exists only for
&gt; tax breaks for corporations, not to actually be used. But that's another
&gt; story.


Dear Mr. Wagner:

Greetings once again.  Thank you for sharing this last assemblage of
information
with me.  After reviewing our ARB Web page
(http://www.arb_dot_ca_dot_gov/msprog/avrp/avrp.htm), I am somewhat puzzled. 
First, the
word &quot;voluntary&quot; is in boldface type and used in several places.  These
programs
exist in several places throughout California and except for the pilot
project I
mentioned which is operated under ARB's auspices, the other &quot;scrap&quot;
programs are
operated regionally, usually with the help of the local air district
having the
jurisdiction for that area.  So, if I voluntarily scrap my vehicle, what
difference does it make to me if they smash the whole thing or not?

There is another angle, though, and this is the toughest part, as far as
I
know.  This is the reason we have a pilot program in the South Coast Air
Basin.
We are trying to find out just how much &quot;bang for the buck&quot; there is
when
vehicles are removed from the road, e.g., just how much air pollution
will be
stopped when this vehicle no longer functions?  This information is of
critical
importance because many people want to assign a dollar value to the
amount of
emissions that are reduced.  Clearly, if certain parts of the vehicle
are put
back into use (even if they don't pollute the air), it will directly
effect the
monetary value within this overall process.

For example, what is a &quot;fair market value&quot; for a scrapped car?  $500? 
$750?
$200?  Unless that vehicle is 100% removed from the vehicle population,
we
automatically have a &quot;sliding scale&quot; and the potential for some major
administrative headaches!

I hope your friends on the mailing list fully comprehend that these
programs
(all of them, including ARB's) are voluntary and they have strict
eligibility
requirements for the vehicles (about five or six such restrictions). 
And I hope
this helps--I appreciate the opportunity to explore these issues with
you!

Sincerely, Jon Pederson, Helpline Services,
California Air Resources Board
