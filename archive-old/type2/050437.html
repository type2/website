Andy,

By using the handy dandy Transporter Resource Guide (www.mindspring_dot_com/~ncbus/trg/ ) I was able to determine the following exciting info : M-code  791- Prepared for the installation of UTILA-ambulance (Only for the German state of Bavaria) 231  

Really, I am serious.

I know you are proud but please don't let it go to your head :)

Chris

Any clue as to 21? My 68 kombi has it as well.
How about 791 792 the parts manual stops in the 500s.
