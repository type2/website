	I didn't see if you got any answers or not, I hesitate to  give much heater
info,, I'm not a pro. We spent almost $300 getting our heater gone through by
a VW mechanic when we first got the bus  The heater did not work at all,
improperly maintained they can be dangerous.		
	Sounds like you have a BA-6 Factory  deluxe heater. They do run after the car
is turned off to expel excess heat(I was told) There is a &quot;Black box&quot; under
the dash aprox, behind the speedometer, with a red re-set button on it. Try
that first. I have looked at the heater system under our bus, I can't make any
sense of it. If it breaks, I gotta find a mechanic/heater guy for that one
good luck.....johnny
