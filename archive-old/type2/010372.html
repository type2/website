I just placed an ad on the Air-cooled Buy &amp; Sell site
http://home.graphics.uwaterloo_dot_ca/vwbuysell/index.html for the following:

E-mail: dannyk_at_microsoft_dot_com or dannymk_at_hotmail_dot_com
Phone: 425.867.0613 hm or 425.936.1452 wk
City: Bellevue
Province/State: WA
Region: USA
Type of ad: Vehicle For Sale
Year of vehicle/part: 75

Price: $400.00 us funds
Description: Non running stock '75 bus. Needs rebuild or great parts bus.

Bio:  Before parking I had a mechanic scope it out and it needs at the very
least rings, #3 piston and a new head.  I was able to drive it into my drive
way (very under-powered) but it has since stopped turning over. It's a 1.8
FI with 172k miles.  I've had one guy put refundable earnest money down on
it but he doesn't speak &quot;bus&quot; or very good English so I'm a little leery of
selling a project bus to someone that is looking for a family car - it's not
running or reliable in its present condition.  Don't get me wrong, I want to
sell it - I just don't want to dupe the unwashed when it comes to the
&quot;special nature&quot; of our air-cooled vehicles.

Thanks!
