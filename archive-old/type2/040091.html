Subject: Canadian Parts Source

Web searching and magazine viewing indicates that there are plenty of
companies offering aftermarket VW Bus parts.  Most of these companies
are located in the US (primarily California and Florida).  Ording into
the US means exchanging Canadian to US funds, and dealing with Customs
delays and Customs fees.  Are there any good Canadian VW parts
specialists (new car dealers excluded)?
