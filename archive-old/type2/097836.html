Subject: Starter woes

Ok. I'm really frustrated now:

I've been experiencing slight issues with my starter for about six months.
I even replaced the starter once, to no avail. The problem seems to be the
solenoid.

So last week my battery went dead and I found out I needed to replace my
alternator (or rather, I ended up replacing it, I'm still not sure if I
really needed it). I also replaced my voltage regulator. I took the bus to
Autozone to get the battery tested and they charged it for me and said it
was good. In the meantime, I went ahead and switched out the starter with
the rebuild one they had on the shelf.

So now I have a new alternator, new voltage regulator, new starter, all
connectors have been thoroughly cleaned. I've bypassed the starter switch
and installed a couple toggles and a starter button. It still doesn't
engage the starter properly each time. Usually I just hear a 'click' like
the solenoid isn't engaging.

This is in a '74 with the original 1.8l engine. I'm at wits-end.

-Eric
