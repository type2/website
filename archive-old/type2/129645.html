Subject: RE: [T2] Re:Electric Bus (original VW electrobus)

From what I have read, it takes 16 + batteries to get a 55 mph speed and a
range of 60-100 miles. Depending on weight and road conditions, hills, etc.
Also the type of kit will determine the range and speed. AC kits seem to be
better, but cost a lot more than the DC kits. I was not thinking about doing
this to a bus, I was just interested in reading about it. I am currently
looking into other electric vehicles, but a bus would not make a good one. No
fun to camp within 60 miles of home :) This was more for educational reading.

From what I have read, the rabbit kits look to be the easiest way to get 65
mph and 80-100 mile range for the least money. Which still would be over $4000
even if you already have the car.
