Subject: After the rebuild---opinions sought
Message-ID: &lt;20b35436.246236af_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Greetings from SoCal---
	I'll attempt to keep this brief.  I needed a new clutch and exhaust 
recently on my '77 Westfalia, and as I had a few bucks amassed, decided to 
also take care of all the stuff that I'd been meaning to do---seals, fuel 
lines, motor mounts, heater boxes, linkage, etc.  I amassed all the parts 
that I thought I would need (thanks Karl, Bus Depot) and took it to the place 
that had been doing my big stuff for the last 12 years (I am definitely not 
qualified to work on a type4).  While going through the engine, a large crack 
through an exhaust valve guide was discovered.  At this point I should 
mention that this was an absolutely unmolested motor with 155K, still with 
great compression (135-ish all around), used a little oil, but ran perfect, 
better than my old '71 on its best day.  ANYWAY, with several long trips 
pending, I decided to spring for the Mark Stephens heads and do the rings 
while we're at it.  You can see where this is headed---rod bearing shavings 
were found, then a well-worn cam.  Time to split the case, gotta bore it, 
might as well go to hydraulics, the full catastrophe.  I used the best stuff 
available, but absolutely ran out of money and was forced to re-use my 
pistons and cylinders---not a good thing, but I had no choice.
	So with great anticipation, I picked the thing up after weeks of 
downtime and was immediately underwhelmed.  I now have about 2K on it (just 
back from a pretty rugged Baja trip of about 1,000 miles), and have an engine 
that I consider to be inferior in every respect to the one that I brought 
in---it's noisier, has less power, and more vibration.  I know that cylinder 
shims were used according to MSHP spec's (I even called them, and they 
acknowledged that stock rebuilds &quot;may seem a little sluggish&quot;), but it feels 
like it's running at about 90 lbs.  It also makes a weird growl under load 
(possibly due to old p &amp; c's ?), and doesn't seem to idle consistently.  
While I dearly wish that I could have sprung for the complete blueprint thing 
and the counter-weighted crank and all that, I've been assured that 
everything is well within factory spec, but the fact remains that my original 
engine ran better and smoother, pulled better, got better mileage, all on 
regular gas.  My wrench (a longtime, well respected VW-only shop) is 
sympathetic and wants me to be happy, but as there's nothing overtly wrong 
with it, doesn't really know what to do about it, as it still runs better 
than most of the buses out there.
	I guess my question is whether or not my experience is typical for 
this motor, or whether I should keep squawking to the shop.  Are all current 
rebuilds deliberately de-tuned as this one seems to be (I never got a real 
answer on why the rebuilds should have lower compression.  Perhaps so they 
can offer that 100K warranty on the heads?)  I would love to communicate with 
anyone with a similar engine and situation, and all comments welcomed.

Thanks for reading, Matt Q.
