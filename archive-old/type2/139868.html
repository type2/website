Subject: Re: [T2] Rust  Removal Shops?

&gt; Hey, I posted this once before, but I don't remember
&gt; getting any response back.  Whether it just didn't go
&gt; through or it was just such a ludicrous question, I
&gt; don't know.  Anyway, I was just wondering if anyone
&gt; knew if there was such thing as a rust removal shop.
&gt; Like a place that I could take the bus and have them
&gt; repair any and all rust including the rusted out
&gt; parts.  I know this sounds very unrealistic and lazy,
&gt; but I don't have the tools or knowledge to do it
&gt; myself.  Again, any help is greatly appreciated.

the Metal wizard among others will do the rust removal thing, but how deep
are your pockets,  I superficially looked into it and then bought a welder
and learned to weld.  much cheaper....
