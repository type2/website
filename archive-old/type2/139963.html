&lt;&lt; I'm afraid to figure out what I spent on the restoration.


Cheers, dave &gt;&gt;

Not much, you did pay yourself in 1978 dollars, didn't you...?-)
I'm on a few other antique car lists, and as far as I can tell, the
only ones who make money on a restoration are the guys who
get paid up front to restore other peoples cars...If you figure
your time like an attorney, and tally up &quot;all&quot; the time spent on 
the project...Even the hours spent writing up an order for parts,
for example... and put a $ value on it, any restoration will quickly
outrun the value of the restored car. There are even &quot;restoration
specialists&quot; who've gone as far as to sub work out to those oft-
mentioned third world countries for lower labor costs (and higher
profits to the restorer...;-)
