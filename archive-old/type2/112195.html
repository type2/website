Subject: Re: [T2] no end play :(

Today I put the
&gt; case halves together and torqed all the bolts and
&gt; the crank turns
&gt; smoothly.  I then thought I'd check the endplay.
&gt;                                                     
      Did you put the big bearing on the end of the
crank backwards, looking at the bearing can you see
the four dished places on it? If you can't see them
it's time to take it back apart. Phil
