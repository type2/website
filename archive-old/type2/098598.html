&gt; I am in the process of rebuilding my 79 2.0 Fuel Injected engine. 
&gt; I am not going to put the fuel injection back on as of now and was
&gt; wondering what your guys suggestions on getting a carb would be?

Why are you ditching the FI system? When kept up they are fantastic
for one of your main requirements below &quot;reliable and easy to
service&quot;. My experience w/ the pancake engines is completely FI, so I
can only repeat what has been echoed on this list for the carb
engines. If you decide to ditch the FI, do try &amp; get a good set of
dual carbs. The problem w/ the single carb is that it has very long
runners for the fuel/air mixture to ice in. That means on cool (not
necess cold) days your bus w/ run horrible, if at all. Now depending
on what you are doing to the engine, FI does have the downside of not
really being able to build an engine much more than stock hp. 

Hopefully someone can speak up that knows more than this, but. The
valves in the FI head are smaller. From my understanding b/c of the
FI's need, (or lack of nead really) for engine vacuum to help actually
deliver the fuel. Since the fuel is under pressure &amp; released it
should be mostly vapor form for as opposed to having the carb need a
flow of air to help atomize the fuel. Something to consider, esp since
you will be putting new heads on. Don't forget that you have the
vanagon heads w/ square ports to, so you need to make sure &amp; get the
correct heads or change out most of your exhaust system.

&gt; duals or a single? I had a progressive on a bus a couple years back
&gt; on a 74 and it performed great and was reliable. I wouldn9t mind
&gt; having another but would this be too underpowered for a 2.0. What
&gt; about duals are they worth it.  I want this bus to be reliable and
&gt; easy to service. I don9t want to be adjusting every couple weeks but
&gt; I also want to use the power of a 2.0.
