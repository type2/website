Hi All

I recently bought a couple new turn signal lens for my 71 Westy.

When I pulled off the old lens, I noticed that the metal housing
(that holds the bulb) had lost most of its reflective chrome
plated surface. Since I knew I couldn't just run down and get
a new one, I decided to refresh it myself.

I took out the housing and removed all the dirt and the rest of
the &quot;chrome&quot; which actually fell off. I refreshed the contact points
for the bulb with a little sand paper, then put a wad of paper in the
hole to block it off. I then took some spray adhesive and coated
the surface that reflects the light. Then I got some old fashioned
aluminum foil, making sure I used the shiny surface up and applied
it to the housing. Once I was sure the glue was set, I used an 
exacto knife to cut the hole and excess away. While its not as
shiny as chrome, it for sure is more reflective than rust!

I reassembled everything and compared my refreshed unit to the
one to the I hadn't touched yet - much brighter. So, before you
go spend a lot of moola on a used housing you might consider this route
first. Cost? Zip.
