Subject: Sunroof cover advice needed.

I need to know what experiences others have had with different 
types of sunroof covers.  A friend with a 23 has a canvas top 
that he refuses to drive if there is any chance of rain.  He said 
it leaked from the day he installed it.  I am probably going to go 
with white vinyl.  What suppliers have others used and how was the 
quality of materials, fit &amp; finish, etc.?

Dave
