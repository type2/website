Subject: Paint question - Thanks

First off, thanks to everyone that replied to my question, even those =
who had
not-so-nice things to say, you shall remain nameless.  I even got a, &quot;

The general consensus seems to be either incompatible primer/paint =
combo,
i.e.. mixing acrylic and enamel (even if both are same brand) ; or oil, =
grease,
dirt, whatever under the paint.

So I re-sanded where I needed and tried again.  Using the same primer, =
which
I don't think was the problem, and a Krylon (instead of the Rust-o-leum) =
top=20
coat and this seems to have worked.  It's not perfect.  It's not a =
factory new=20
job.  But I can be happy with it.

BUT, I did get a little carried away with trying difference things and =
got a bit=20
of over spray on the window.  Now that it's dry, what the best way to =
remove
it?  Razor blade?  Some chemical product?

Again, thanks for all the replies.
