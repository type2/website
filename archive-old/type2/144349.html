Subject: [T2]76 Shiftrod no third or fourth or reverse

ok so got the front rubber bushing in there and the shift rod is not loose as it was, but however when i went to clean up the stop plate i noticed it was cracked on one side...the passenger side very small but all the way through.? 
maybe this is expanding just the slightest causing it to not go into 3rd or fourth.... or reverse.... 
the shifter seems alot tighter but still very far apart in the gears and like i said cant reach third fourth or reverse at all.... i am wishing upon the problem being the stop plate now... 

tony(friend from marion nc) also thought this could be the problem...and mentioned this to me yesterday.... 

so does anyone have a stop plate...? i dont care if its dirty i can clean it up just need one that isnt cracked or got a crack in it LOL.. someone fairl close so i can maybe get on the road again in myt daily driver..... 


i will mess with the stopl plate i have later its hot out there and see if maybe i just dont have it centered back in the right spot but i am guessing it being broken in one place small as it is its all the way through hoping this is the problem..? 

from what i read on ratwells site it suggest that third and fourth not being found can be from the back but i checked it around nose cone and looked fine... i do not know condition of ball inside though as mentioned there.....
