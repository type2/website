&gt; &gt; On my 1970, the two hoses that run from fan shroud to
&gt; heat exchangers each got
&gt; &gt; a nice little tear where they pass through the engine
&gt; tin. Is there anything I
&gt; &gt; can put around those holes  to soften the edges so I'm
&gt; not changing them along
&gt; &gt; with the oil every 3,000 miles?
simple!
just take some vacuum hose or fuel hose...slit it
lengthwise, and fit onto the inside of hole in tin...cut to
fit...I've been doing this for 20 years....works great for
proteting any holes in shetmetal from chaffing wires, hoses
etc..
