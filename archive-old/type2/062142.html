Subject: Re: Dormobiles

I have my own dormobile question:  did they make breadloaf/baywindow/lagwagon
dormobiles?  I saw a lagwagon/baywindow/breadloaf with the distinct doormobile
top coming home from party last saturday, where I'd met a really nice red-head
girl, 5' 11&quot;, just took the the bar... but thats another story...

It definitely looked like a doormobile: car the windows in the top, the 
right shape to the top, not like a normal westy with windows cut in it...
