Subject: [T2] No compression on #3.

Hello all, I tried to send this a few days ago, but I think that something 
went haywire, so if you have already seen this post I apologise.  While 
recently on a trip down the Oregon Coast my 77 westy was running at about 
210-220? oil  temp, I everything was working fine save my worries that it 
was running too hot.  I pulled off to change drivers and to cool off a 
little and just then it stumbled a little.  I thought little of it.  When we 
got back on the road it would barely run.  It felt really bogged down and 
there was a noticible knock comeing from the driver side of the engine.  We 
pulled over again.  This time for good.  Now it will start but hardly run.  
Also it backfired from the intake on a later start up?  Compression test 
shows 120 on all but  #3 which has zero, and I mean none, like the valve it 
stuck open or something.  The exhaust valve on 3 has lots of play, maybe 
.050 or so?  I am stumped and plan to do the engine drop this weekend, but 
would really appreciate any clues.  I extensively searched the archives and 
found nothing of much help.

Have a great monday.
