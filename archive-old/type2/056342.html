Subject: compression 

I want to lower the compression in the engine I am rebuilding (1600cc)to
between 7 &amp; 7.3 to 1.  I can do this by adding shims (.040) or having
local machine shop remove same amount from top of piston. 

Questions to the list:

Who has changed compression by using shims under cylinders?  Any
problems with this method later? I have been told that the shims can
&quot;burn out&quot;

Who has changed compression by removing metal from the top of the
pistons? Problms?
