Not a vw but one I put anti freeze in the diesel tank on a John Deer
tractor and then started the engine. It quickly died. It took several
hours to get everything cleaned out. I am not the only one that has
done this for years after that I got call about what to do when you
put anti freeze in the fuel tank. On late model JD tractors the fule
tank is right in front of the radiator.

Another good reason for air cooled.
