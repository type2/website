Subject: 73 Sportsmobile Parts

Fellow listees,

I came across a totaled 1973 Sportsmobile in a wrecking yard in Fort Wayne,
Indiana.  This bus seemed to be fairly complete as far as the interior,
however, being an owner of a 74 Westy, I do not know if parts have been
modified.  As far as I know, the engine and tranny are called for.  If
interested, you can contact Mark Sharpe _at_ 219-627-6576 for part
information.  He has no access to the internet and l told him that I would
post this for him.
