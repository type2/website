&gt; I have a '79 Westy and I just noticed rust forming
 at the rear base of the
 rear driver's side vent window - in other words, the
 metal vertical
 &quot;bar&quot;/&quot;frame member&quot; that is between for the rear
 driver's side vent window
 and the fixed side window.
 
  
 
Question 1 - Is that vertical metal bar between the
vent window and the fixed window part of the vent
frame? The body? A separate piece of metal?

* The bar is the frame of the vent window. 
 
Question 2 - Is it available anywhere?  Does someone
have a good one they'd part with?

* You will need to find someone selling a good non
rusty vent window FOR a Westfalia. Westies are black
metal, passenger buses are chrome. Is it too far gone
to sand and repaint black?

Question 3 - Are the rubber gaskets available for
the vent window?  For the fixed window?  Where?

Question 5 - What is the recommended disassembly and
reassembly order/procedure?
 
* Find a good replacement vent window. Order a new
vent window seal. Order a new large w/vent seal:

Remove large window. Slide vent window back 1&quot;. Remove
from bus.

OR..... get a solid window like you have on the pass
side and install it on the drivers side [same window!]
And use this seal:
