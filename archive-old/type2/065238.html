just kinda messing around, and decided to see just how many buses i'd been
keeping track of over these last 2.5 years:

now, these are ALL the buses that i know of, anywhere on the Internet, from
postings to either/both lists and/or the newsgroups like rec.autos.vw.etc
and so forth.

50 Microbus   0  59 Microbus  18  68 Bus  38  80 Vanagon  54  91 Eurovan   1
51 Microbus   0  60 Microbus  19  69 Bus  46  81 Vanagon  65  92 Eurovan   5
52 Microbus   1  61 Microbus  23  70 Bus  63  82 Vanagon  98  93 Eurovan  40
53 Microbus   2  62 Microbus  20  71 Bus 147  83 Vanagon  46  94 Eurovan   1
54 Microbus   5  63 Microbus  16  72 Bus  88  84 Vanagon 124  95 Eurovan  11
55 Microbus   2  64 Microbus  29  73 Bus  78  85 Vanagon 114  96 Eurovan   0
56 Microbus   8  65 Microbus  34  74 Bus  60  86 Vanagon  66
57 Microbus   5  66 Microbus  60  75 Bus  30  87 Vanagon 135
58 Microbus  11  67 Microbus  62  76 Bus  50  88 Vanagon  32
                                  77 Bus  77  89 Vanagon  31
                                  78 Bus  88  90 Vanagon  48
                                  79 Bus  49  91 Vanagon  40

 Microbus 315 - Camper  73, Panel   22, Pickup  53, Kombi   38, Deluxe  59
 Bus      814 - Camper 449, Panel    7, Pickup  15, Kombi   21
 Vanagon  854 - Camper 412, Panel    1, Pickup   9, Diesel  44, Syncro 103
 Eurovan   58 - Camper  21, Panel    2, Pickup   0, Diesel   3
 Total   2041

the old 71's are still out in front. :) and the campers are running at just
about 50 percent of the known buses and vanagons and eurovans. must be the
high number of trucks that keep the Microbus camper percentage down. ;)
