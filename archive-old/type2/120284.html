Subject: Re: [T2] CV's and Molybdenum Disufide

Years ago we used to do a lot of CV joint service on
VW's and other imports. Now most just use rebuilt axle
shafts on the others because they're so cheap. But we
got tired of paying for the special CV joint grease
and started buying a commercial grease called
&quot;high-moly&quot;. I don't remember who made it but in years
of service we never had a problem with it, and if I
remember correctly it cost only a couple of bucks per
tube. It came in the big cartridges to fit hand grease
guns.
