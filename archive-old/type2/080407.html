Subject: Re: [T2] Front window drain holes??

The water would drain behind the dash and the kick panels.

It could be done but i don't know if it would be better or worse - from a 
rust stand point.

I think VW wanted to believe that their windshield gasket would keep out 
the moisture. maybe it did for a while but when it got old...

They did the same thing on the passenger vent windows (backseat area).



&gt;With the talk of water building up along the front windshield, has anyone
&gt;ever drilled holes for draining?  I have been thinking about doing this,
&gt;but don't know how I would set up a drainage tube, etc...   On my
&gt;boyfriend's '78 f*rd (that he's restoring) the front window frame has 2
&gt;holes, one on each end of the window.  And because of that, there was no
&gt;rust under his seal!!

Ciao!
