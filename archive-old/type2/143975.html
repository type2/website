Subject: Re: [T2] Re [T2] burning bus on COPS

I like the big island, though it can be very humid at
times.  Are you in Hilo, Kona, or out in the country? 
Either Hilo or Kona would be a very small town
stateside.  But then so would Juneau, Alaska (the
capitol).  I think it rained every time I was in Hilo.
 I guess that's the wet side of the island.  But I
like it.  I like Mauii a lot.  But I'd probably live
on Oahu if I could.  I'm a jazz musician and it's rare
to find jazz in small towns.  And I'm a big WWII buff.
 I operated from the radio room of the USS Missouri
all afternoon one day.  That was a blast!  Talked to
people all over the world. (Didn't mean to make you
ham operators jealous) 

I'm going to plug my vent tube.  I don't give a crap
about reburning the stuff.  And the carbon filter has
been gone for a long time.  I've owned a lot of old
cars that haven't had a vent for the tank and have
never had a problem.  My engine is just old enough
that I don't have to worry about inspections.  So I've
made up my mind....

And the only thing better than half-naked hula girls
are naked hula girls.  But then those grass skirts are
somewhat appealing, ha.  I need to be there long
enough to learn to surf.  Looks like it'd be a blast. 
More fun than the hula girls?  Hmmm....

Mahalo, Timo....KR

&gt; Kevin, I live on the Big Island and I do know how

&gt; Split window busss are getting scarce on this
&gt; island, rust never sleeps.
&gt; A clean bay goes for $3-$5,000 on average. I saw a
&gt; very clean 1971
&gt; Westfalia advertised for $3,500. I picked my 1977
&gt; Kombi, with a fried
&gt; top end, together with a crusty parts bus with a
&gt; running 1600 for $500.
&gt; Shipping a bus here from California runs  about
&gt; $900. I have heard that
&gt; shipping a Westfalia with the propane tank is a
&gt; hassle now, since 9/11,
&gt; but I've never tried. Housing here is VERY
&gt; expensive, we joke: &quot;VW vans
&gt; are the only affordable housng&quot;.
