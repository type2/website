Subject: Re: [T2] Horn

Hi Steve,
By your diagnostic, the horn needs to be replaced, which makes sense to me.
Thanks for the help.

&gt; The horn should not ground to the frame!!!!  It is insulated internally
&gt; and there is not supposed to be any isolation between the mount point and
&gt; the frame.
&gt;
&gt; Do this as a diagnostic:
&gt;
&gt; Pull both wires off the horn,            No horn, check??
&gt; then turn the bus on;
&gt;
&gt; Put each wire on the horn,               If the horn began sounding when
&gt; one at a time;                           either of the wires was attached,
&gt;                                          label that wire 12V+ and replace
&gt;                                          your horn, it's dead.
&gt;
&gt; If neither wire alone causes the horn to blow, then put one wire back on
&gt; and connect a jumper to ground.  If the horn blows, then (a) that's the
&gt; 12V+ wire and (b) your horn is fine.  If the horn will not blow, then
&gt; switch wires and try it with the other wire.  There is no insulation
&gt; between the horn and the body.  The electrical isolation of the horn is
&gt; internal to the horn and if it has broken down (rare), the horn is dead
&gt; and must be replaced.  Ask away with more questions if you need to!
