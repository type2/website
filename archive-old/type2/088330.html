Subject: Re: [T2] Adding Oxygen Sensor.

Ron:

Since I just acquired an '82 Federal Westy to compliment my '81 California
Vanagon, and since the Westy has a &quot;shot&quot; muffler welded to the catalytic
converter in front of it, is what you suggest below a viable way for me to
replace the catalytic converter/muffler combo, assuming I don't want to stay
&quot;stock&quot;?  I'm intrigued because I'm trying to figure out if I want the Westy
to stay Federal or convert it to California and here's a way to make the
conversion without committing to all the somewhat-scarce left-side
components (heat exchanger, separate manifold) of the California model.

 &gt; Actually there would be a way to add an 02 sensor to a 49-state Vanagon
(or
&gt; late bus) exhaust without having to weld in a fitting. Since you are
&gt; replacing your parts anyway, you could order a watercooled Vanagon cat
&gt; converter and a 1.9 liter ('83-85) watercooled Vanagon muffler, in place
of
&gt; the aircooled ones. These would bolt right up to the stock late bus or
&gt; Vanagon crossover pipe and look the same cosmetically, but that cat has a
&gt; built in port for an 02 sensor.
