Subject: Battery Pan rust

73 Safari Camper Bus.  The front end of my battery pan is corroded right =
through. I think it is the result of a leaking battery sometime in the =
past.=20
I was quoted $150 Cdn to cut it out an replace it.  The guy recommended =
just using mastic and sticking a plate in under the battery to close the =
hole.  (The hole is about 2 inches in diameter.

Any suggestions?=20

The more we disagree, the more chance there is that one of us is right.
