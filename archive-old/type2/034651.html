Subject: Re: power loss, idle trouble [1600DP, Solex 30] follow-up

ahh yes...forgot to mention some things..
my problem is still persistent after the following.
1600 SP motor..
fuel filter fine, fuel pump fine and pumping as usual, carb rebuilt 2 months
ago, fresh gas, no vacuum leaks, new plugs and plug wires, new dizzy
components, not carb icing as I use preheated air, valves all set, everything
is the way it should be...its just this cold thing.  Is it the winter gas
perhaps????
thanks
