&gt; available, have an incorrect backspacing.  VW is, I believe, 35 mm and
&gt; the Audi is 45 mm.  To use the Audi wheels on a type2, you have to open
&gt; up the center and use a 10 mm spacer with the necessary longer studs.
&gt; Even with the spacer, the incorrect offset is going to be rough on the
&gt; wheel bearings.  The Merc wheels are the best answer, but they tend to
&gt; be a bit pricey.  Ford, Chevy, Jeep, Chryco etc, just plain don't fit.

near me is a shop called the &quot;Rim Source&quot; that sells nothing but custom
wheel rims (and does the car hoping hydralics, imagine that on a bus) but
I stopped by and asked him and he showed me a number of different wheels
that were the right size.   Nothing cheap though.
