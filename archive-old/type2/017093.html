Subject: Bus theft prevention

A short passage from an article in the CAA (Canadian Auto Association)
magazine reads:

&quot;Now available at CAA ... ez-id etching provides an affordable means of
preventing auto theft .... Your vehicle's VIN is chemically etched on
all windows of your vehicle.  It has been proven that thieves will not
steal a vehicle that has been etched with the VIN because all the etched
glass must be replaced with new glass before the vehicle has any resale
value to anyone involved in the stolen car trade.  But don't confuse
this service with one offered by some companies and dealerships wherein
a random code or PIN number is etched on the glass.  These bear no
correlation to the manufacturer's VIN and are of little use to law
enforcement officers during roadside stops.
The VIN is like your social insurance number, registered with the
Ministry of Transportation ... your VIN is accessible to all law
enforcement agencies.&quot;

OK, so they are, at a minimum, guilty of overstatement.  But I wonder
what list members think of this sort of thing.  I would think that Bus
thieves part out Buses so glass wouldn't slow them down much.  And I
really can't see how this method would work - when was the last time a
cop checked your VIN.  But it's their method - and i'd bet anything that
this article was originally found in an AAA mag, so I'd guess it is an
AAA method as well.

Anyone have any thoughts on this
