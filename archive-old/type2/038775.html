&gt;I just received an engine gasket kit for my '79 2.0 L from Bus Depot.  I
&gt;was told that I was going to get an Elring kit, but wound up getting a
&gt;Victor Reinz kit.  Does anyone have experience with Victor Reinz???  Is
&gt;this high quality stuff&gt;  Its made in Germany.  Does anyone know if pushrod
&gt;tube seals in this kit are viton?? Also, do front and rear crankshaft oil
&gt;seals typically come separately from the gasket kit?
&gt;

Reinz has been an OEM supplier to German and many other vehicles since post
WWII. The German manufacture stuff is high quality, spec. stuff. When
installed per factory procedure, they serve function better than anything
else, with a few exceptions. Victor bought into Reinz a few years ago. My
perception it is a marketing arrangment for US sales. 

Cannot recall if their kits contain viton push rod seals. The plain seals
have a matt finish. The viton and silicon have a more glossy surface and
are a bit more &quot;rubbery&quot; than rubber or butyl.

I am not aware that Elring is big in gaskets, but they are big in seals.
Their viton flywheel seal ist superb but even it can leak out of the box if
the shaft it rides on is not polished nicely and it is seated properly. 

No kits I am aware of come with all higher spec seals. I always buy the
good stuff separatly and toss the rubber and butyl stuff. And I kid you
not, you MUST surgically clean all surfaces and prime with a thin film of
oil prior to installation. A thin film of SylGlyde (silicon paste) is
superb for all things rubbery, as long as it is not near glass. Glycerin
for glass seals is superb.

On the T-IV push rod tube installation, use a loooong small screwdriver to
tuck in the inner seals as you install them. They can easily hang and if
you just tap them in they will be sheared and cut and leak like a sieve.
