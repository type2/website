&gt; Hey guys, just curious... I've been reading some of the messages and a lot
&gt; of people have told me that Hydraulic lifters.. or the hydraulic lifter
&gt; conversion on the 1.8 is a BAD idea. My motor that was rebuilt under 1000
&gt; miles ago had already come with the hydraulic lifter conversion when I
&gt; bought the Bus. Any ideas?

Isn't your engine a gex? if so list experience (&amp; some personal
exposure) says there is a very good chance that the hydraulic lifters
are the least of your concern. Check out the archives for the
pros/cons of both sides. I don't really believe there is a right/wrong
selection, although many people have said that miss matching lifters
with cams can be a bad idea if the 2 parts rubbing together are of
a different hardness.
