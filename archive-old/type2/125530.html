Subject: Re: [T2] I just stripped the interior of my 73 Westy...

&gt; Now that's an idea. If you want to give up your walkthru, you could

Or make forget the full kitchen and make a copy of the SO-23 interior 
from early 60s Westfalias. Perfect for people who are dating, and for 
empty-nesters. The only thing that it's missing is a jukebox device 
over the table with a number to push for Dennis Yost and the Classics 
IV.

The SO-23 is neither the safest nor the most efficient camper layout, 
but it is by far the coziest and arguably the classiest. It also lends 
itself well to do-it-yourselfing.

And what a hit it would be at the shows. Well, maybe not with a hightop
