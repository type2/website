I just wanted to share a few thoughts about this show hosted by the Gorge Vw
Club. My daughter Kate and I drove up for this show last year and it was one
of the most enjoyable times I've ever had at a VW event. For those who know
me, I like to drive long distances to VW shows to meet a wide variety of
people. These people have a wonderful setting for their campout and the
show/swap area is clean and well organized. Last year they even raffled off
a Porsche 914! Pretty good for a small club. Beautiful scenery and lots of
great back roads to travel make this a &quot;must do&quot; on my list. Just wanted to
share.
