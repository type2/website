Subject: Remove Clutch Lever

Ok, I tried unsuccessfully to replace my broken return spring without removing
the clutch lever, but the pressure it applies is too much to get the operating
shaft back in the right position. Bently makes causal reference to &quot;remove
lever&quot;, problem is mine won't budge. A few good whacks with the hammer won't
free it and I tried a three arm puller but with no luck. When I crank down on
the center the arms just pop off.  Maybe just a bad fit.

Anyone have any tips on removing the lever?  Maybe a specific brand / size
puller that fits better?

Thanks,

Mike
