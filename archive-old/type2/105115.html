Subject: Re: [T2] What H4's is everyone using in ther Buses?

&lt;&lt; I use the $10 apiece H4's. Almost all are made in India and reboxed with 
odd names.... I even have a pair that

say EMPI on the boxes.

No extra wires or relays needed. They are 'plug 'n play'.

 &gt;&gt;

A while back my buddy bought a blister pack of Craftsman SAE sockets,
mostly because of the &quot;Made in USA&quot; tag on the package. When he got
them home and opened 'em, one 13 mm was in place of the 1/2...It was
marked &quot;Made in Taiwan&quot;... ?-(
