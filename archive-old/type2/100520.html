&gt; &gt; My bus has started and ran with this connector disconnected.
&gt;
&gt;So have *some* of mine.  Others will not.  I think it is a flaw in the AFM
&gt;or in the double relay.  I also think it is a safety hazard, as the design
&gt;shuts off fuel in the event of the engine being not running and the key
&gt;being on (after an accident, say).  At the same time, I have to say
&gt;(guiltily) that I have never bothered to fix any of mine that ran with the
&gt;AFM unplugged.

I don't think the pump always needs to run in order idle after start.

For one thing the open temp sensor in the AFM will give a strong request for 
a rich (long) pulse to the injectors. Also the pump charges the fuel 
manifold during the start cycle to get things going.

In addition a normal vacuum of 14.42 in Hg is equivalent to a 7 psi fuel 
pump.  20 in Hg is close to 10 psi.

As to the safety hazard if the pump isn't running it shouldn't be a problem 
but I haven't verified that the pump is dead in this idle mode.
