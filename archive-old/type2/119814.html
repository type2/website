Subject: Lost VW bus font FOUND!

I had several requests to post this to the list when
found, and thanks to Eric Lykins, I have found the
VERY cool VW bus font. Sorry for the marginal content,
but I did have several requests from listmembers to
post it when found, so here's the link:

&quot;So we got into the red VW microbus with the shovels and the rakes and the implements of destruction and we headed on to the police officer's station...&quot;
