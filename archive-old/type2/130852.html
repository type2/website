Hi Paul,

According to Buskatier Mike Hanson:  &quot;Its in albuquerque with Myron 
Hill of kubelkar fame... He was going to give it back to me and I was 
going to pass it on to Andy Wand, but he neglected to bring it the last 
time we all met up. I'll keep you posted.&quot;

There is a tentative plan that will see it travel to Alaska in the next 
few weeks.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Hi All,
&gt;     Today being Friday and all, I thought I'd ask a question not
&gt; related to the mechanics of our buses.  Does anyone know where the
&gt; HUBCAP and related trinket box are?
