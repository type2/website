&gt; &gt; I'm new to the list and hope someone has had a similar problem.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; When I try to wash the windshield, I end up with washer fluid on my
shoe.
&gt; &gt; I'm wondering if anyone has advice on how to change/replace the hose.

I replaced all the cracked hoses in my &quot;78.  This was the very last &quot;bug&quot; I
ran into after getting it on the road after 10 years of sitting - the wet
shoe scenario. The only problem was finding the right size hose at FLAPS. I
believe the original was 8mm? All they had were standard sizes. I found that
the hose I bought was fine on the inside diameter but where the two hoses
connect at the junction under the steering column, the outside diameter was
too large for them both to fit. So I ended up whittling a little off both so
they fit. No problems since.
