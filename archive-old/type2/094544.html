Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Wheel Powdercoating not a good thing?

VW (and others) have used that bolt design for many years.  However i 
have heard of many vintage vehicles (several brands) with wheel torque 
problems.  As far as i know all were resolved by using new bolts/nuts.  
Another problem with lug centric wheels is that it can be difficult to 
tell if the wheel was properly seated.  What is strange about this is 
that it is very rare that you will lose a wheel from lugs.  Generally 
your vehicle handling will tell you something is wrong long before you 
separate from your wheel.  Ball joint separation or axel nut loss are 
more likely causes of lost wheels.

&gt;&gt; There's gotta be a better way to keep these wheels on the busses.
&gt;&gt; I've heard story after story of wheels coming off VW's and had one do
&gt;&gt; the same to me.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Is it the fact that they use lug bolts instead of studs and lugnuts?
&gt;&gt; What are some recomendations for keeping the wheels on ....other than
&gt;&gt; &quot;torque to the specs as per the bentley&quot;. We all know that. Sometimes
&gt;&gt; doesn't seem to work though. 4000 miles isn't that much.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I've never had another brand vehicle even have the lugnuts loosen up
&gt;&gt; at all. Must be a flaw in the design of lug bolts. Why did they do it
&gt;&gt; that way?
