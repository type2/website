Dear Listees,

I also just got a call from Josh's friend Chad.  I'm glad that I am in digest
mode or otherwise I would have found out about it on the list.  Josh was a
friend of mine.  I got to know him over the past year.  We caravanned to BBA
this summer and had a great time.  I will miss him greatly.  Josh was a bright
young man and it is a great loss to never be able to see him again.  I don't
condone what he did, but I hope he is at peace.

Josh, we will miss you.

Rob Dahlgren
