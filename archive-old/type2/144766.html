Subject: 83 Vanagon Drive train F/S

I really don't want to store this so I'm going to make
the list an offer it can't refuse:

Rebuilt 2 ltre engine w/ new heads, piston and bores,
cam, lifters, oil pump, shaft, along with all the
skin, heat exchangers, intake manifoldw/ injectors,
AFM, ECU, harness, new clutch, rebuilt Rancho tranny. 
Just slide it in and bolt it up and turn the
key.......$1750  Offer expires Monday Morning so if
you have a early Vanagon in need of an engine don't
hesitate.

This would be hard to ship so you need to plan on a
trip to Utah if interested
