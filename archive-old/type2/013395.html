Subject: Dilemma: Fuel Lines vs. Fuel Tank

Hello All -
Situation #1: My fuel lines are in need of replacing, very soon.  However,
since I'm gonna need to drain my fuel tank in order to do that, that brings
me to Situation #2: I have some debris floating about in my fuel tank
(presumably pieces of my deteriorating fuel filler tube) that threaten to
clog up the outbound fuel line if I let my fuel level get too low.  When I
learned of this problem, the debris had completely choked off my fuel
supply and I had to have it air-blown out of there at my trusty German
repair shop; now I don't dare let my fuel get below 1/2 full -- and I would
obviously need to in order to change the fuel lines.  Anyway, is it
possible to do the fuel line replacement without draining the tank?  Or, if
not, does anyone have any techniques for unclogging a fuel tank from the
outside without the use of compressed air?  I don't want to have to have it
towed in just to have someone else do that.  Of course, any other
perspectives on this dilemma are welcome as well.  Thanks!
