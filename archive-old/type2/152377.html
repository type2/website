&gt;BAD and WRONG information!!!
&gt;NO way NO how can you transfer ownership
without it!

Sorry Karl,

I have bought multiple vehicles in California from private sellers 
&quot;AS-IS&quot; without Smog certificates.   Have you?

In each case I transferred ownership without SMOG.  The DMV gave me a 
temporary tag to drive the vehicle while the repairs are done. 
After the vehicle passed smog (often many weeks later) I would be 
given the permanent tags and title.  Each time the DMV people would 
smile and process the paperwork as if they do it a dozen times a day.

This is a great option for sellers....if they have a car that won't 
pass smog they can easily get rid of it, not spend hundreds of 
dollars in repairs (and associated headaches) just to sell it a car 
they don't want/cannot afford to spend any more money on.....Like the 
woman with the Subaru who just had an awful experience.

While the DMV web site says you cannot transfer ownership without 
smog, it is completely possible.   If it was illegal the DMV would 
not have processed my ownership transfers at all.

Bottom line, if you are in California, don't believe what you read 
online.   Go talk to your local DMV office before buying/selling a 
car without smog and find out the real story.  You'll be surprised 
how helpful they can be if you are just honest about the situation.

Note: I have never bought a used car from a dealer, perhaps dealer 
sales are different.

Lastly, another option for non-smogged California cars is for the 
seller to sell them AS IS to an out of state buyer.
