Subject: Steering box needed. New or used?

Known at the time of sale, my,  78 newly purchased Westy (with 79
drivetrain), steering has upwards of 150 play. The replaceable parts
and adjustments to the front end was done by the PO. Everything looks
right and my guru says that for the steering gear all is well.

Except for the play in the steering being a RPITA on the  windy, cold
and rainy drive along I-40, from 4-corners USA, during the second week
of '05, when UT flooded and tornados swept OK, 2k (mile) drive home to
MI, this VW ran strong, braked, shifted and fired up every time. Even
while running 20/50 in single digit ambient temps on the last leg from
Louisville through OH, the bus pressed on, even while my right thigh
was succumbing to frostbite.

The new (211-415-049H  New TRW Brazil Steering Box, 1973 to 1979) box
isn't cheap nor does Bentley recommend a rebuild recommended, by your
average user. Used units occasionally show up on Samba and some parts
vendors.  Would you go with a new one  or take the risk of a used
piece?

Any Help? Any leads? I'm not in a hurry.

If you don't blow on the coals, the flame will go out.

Rick
