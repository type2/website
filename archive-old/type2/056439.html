Subject: RE: original radio

&gt; I don't think any buses came with a radio.  I think they were all dealer
&gt; installed.  Therefore there are several different radios that might be
&gt; considered stock if you consider aftermarket-dealer installed as stock.
&gt; goforit!

Hi,
here in Germany you could buy your transporter with 4 different radios.  
These radios were build by Blaupunkt. I have one of this radios.

The radios were named after german cities (were vw plants are)

Here the descriptions:

        radio wolfsburg (shortwave, am, longwave, connection for tape       
        recorder. M-Number 098. Additional price 230 DM (1DM = 1,85 US$)

        radio ingolstadt (connection for tape, automatic antenna, switches  
        for the different radio stations M-Number 098, 390 DM

        radio emden (as wolfsburg) M Number 097, DM 315

        radio hannover (as ingolstadt, automatic search) M-Number 587
        DM 535.

I found a photo from the ingalstadt in an original prospect from vw. I  
will put this foto on my homepage:

You can get all radios here in germany. If you are interested let me know.

Greetings from the home of the transporter
