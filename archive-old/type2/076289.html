Subject: Re: [T2] Removing tension pin in handbrake handle

&gt; In one of a flurry of cosmetic improvements to my Westy, I bought a new 
&gt; handbrake handle. But I can't get the old one off: The tension pin (Bentley 
&gt; calls it a rolled pin) seems to be in there for keeps. I've used a punch and 
&gt; a drill and tried to press it out too.

roll pins can be a pain. don't bother drilling and a punch is almost as
useless.  if you have seen a gear puller there is a smaller version for
pushing out roll pins, relatively inexpensive at local FLAPS
