&gt;       Anyone have any input on the Pacesetter Extractor that Bus Depot
&gt; sells? I can't see what it looks like - is it the same form as the other
&gt; extractor he sells?? That is, standard extractor, not like the two
&gt; muffler extractor piece of junk I got from RMMW that is now failing for
&gt; the second time??

The Pacesetter is a one-piece, welded-construction unit, not the two-piece
crimped design that RMMW, Empi, etc. sell.  The crimped design is lousy, in
my opinion, as it tends to burst open and leak at the slightest excuse.
Whoever decided that you could crimp rather than weld the end onto a muffler
and expect it to last obviously has not used their product in the real
world.

The Pacesetter, by comparison, is essentially a knockoff of the Italian-made
Ansa one-piece unit, which is now unfortunately long-discontinued.  In my
opinion it is not quite as heavy duty as the Ansa was, but that's a moot
point since you can't get the Ansa anymore. The Pacesetter isn't what I
would call top-notch by any means, but it is the best alternative out there
for '75-78 busses, given that the stock setup would require a crossover pipe
that hasn't been available for years. I have had one complaint about the
fit, but did not have any difficulty putting one on a '77 myself a couple of
years back (and the design has not changed).  No real complaints about build
quality, given the low price. Like I said, the best of the currently
available alternatives, if a far cry from the original (and expensive)
German setup.

Now, if you had a '72-74 or '79 bus, on the other hand, you could put on a
complete Dansk setup for $159.95 that would put the Pacesetter to shame.
You could even put it on a '75-78, but only if you replaced your heat
exchangers with the earlier style.  This is worth considering if your heat
exchangers are rusting out anyway (particularly since I do have one side in
N.O.S. German at a good price).  But I can't say I'd go to this extreme if I
only needed an exhaust system and my heat exchangers were fine.  The
Pacesetter is a cheap and relatively inexpensive way to go.
