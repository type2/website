Well, I didn't get very many responses to my weight survey, but the ones
that I got averaged about 4,000 lbs for a 70's Westy moderately loaded with
0 people inside.  So, with 4 people and a pile of camping gear, I concede
that it would be possible to reach 5,000 but I still think 6,000 is way
heavier than a Westy will ever see, excepting perhaps Al Brase's 82 Vanagon
when chocked full of really heavy stuff.

I will repeat Jan Willem Briër's statistics here, since they are VW's
official say on the matter:

------
That weight (1440 Kg) is without passengers and any other cargo. 4 pass.
and various bits of camping equipment could add another 500 Kg. That makes
a total of roughly 2000 Kg. I would be surprised if someone would get much
over that.

1440 Kg = approx 3200 pounds.
2000 Kg  = approx 4400 pounds.
