Greg , maybe you smoke Potts too much  !!! ;-)

Very nice theory which surely goes with the second thermodynamic law, 
smoke tends to leak or blow out, not to stay confined. Potential, 
kinetic, thermal, electrical, sonic, chemical, electromagnetic energy -- 
all tend to disperse., this is a universal tendency// that the second 
law of thermodynamics speaks of.  This is precisely why things break , 
If we could confine the smoke inside , objects should work for ever , 
imagine a world without warranty and technical support !!!. 
Unfortunately those big corporations do not design smoke proof items. 
this is not their interest  !!!

&gt; According to this theory, it is smoke that makes components work
&gt; because every time you let the smoke out of a component, it stops
&gt; working. It seems the claim has been verified through extensive field
&gt; testing.
