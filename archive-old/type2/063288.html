Subject: Need help prepping drilled holes

How's that for a subject line?   :)

Anyway, I'm going to be drilling a couple of holes in my van
in order to facilitate the intake/exhaust pipes for the Propex
heater I bought.  I need some advice, though, on how I should
prep/paint the holes so I can keep the rust demon at bay.

Any help is much appreciated. 

Thanks,
