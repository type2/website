&gt;Finally of all, what the hell is that smell?  You surely know the smell I
&gt;mean.  I have smelled it no other place than VWs.  Air cooled VWs.  I
&gt;smelled it in my parent's old squareback.  I smell it in my bus.  It's not
&gt;altogether unpleasant, when I smell it it makes me keenly aware that I'm
&gt;driving my bus, one of my favorite things to do.

There is a distinct VW aircooled interior smell and I've rationalized it as
the horsehair seat stuffing combined with years of trace exhaust and
gasoline fumes.   I've noticed a distinct smell common to '65-'68 Mustangs
also.  I've convinced myself it is the emissions from the vinyl upholstery
and the fabric carpeting.  

Whatever it is and whatever its level of toxicity, it does give you that
&quot;warm, homey&quot; feeling, don't it?!
