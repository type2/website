Terry,
Did you get the Pertronix that was made specifically for the 009 and 005
distributor? I don't yet have one but am planning on purchasing one very soon. I
run the 005 dist. and I know I'll eventually have to go back to the original
dist. to satisfy the smog folks, so I wonder if they are interchangable with the
minor fit details you mentioned. 
One other important point to mention about this specific Pertronix product is
that it is C.A.R.B. certified! (when installed in the original distributor).
One other minor point... don't get mad, but JC Whipme sells 'em for $49.95
(#78FA7246RF), and here's a switch, for any other car they're $69.95! I guess
they have a soft spot for us V Dubbers :)

&gt;Minuses:
&gt;-My 009 distributor uses a square grommet for the points wire to pass through
&gt;the distributor body, but the Pertronix system supplies a round grommet for
this
&gt;application, so the fit is not perfect.
&gt;-Said grommet interferes a little with the distributor cap, which might make a
&gt;little trimming necessary.
&gt;-The magnetic collar prevents the rotor from seating down as far on the rotor
&gt;shaft as much as it would with normal points.  I looked into this a little and
&gt;felt that this might allow the rotor to rotate slightly on the shaft, so I
filed
&gt;some of the length off the rotor, allowing it to seat all the way down.
&gt;-If you follow the directions, you won't be able to get everything installed in
&gt;an 009 distributor due to lack of space for manuevering things around.  I ended
&gt;up taking the magnetic collar off about five times before I was done with
&gt;everything.
&gt;-They supply a spacer to locate the pickup at the correct height relative to
the
&gt;magnetic collar, but it is difficult to determine if you need it or not, as it
&gt;is very difficult to see the references they indicate when everything is
&gt;installed.  I THINK that mine was too low without the spacer, and too high with
&gt;the spacer, but closer to requirement with the spacer.  It would be nice if
they
&gt;supplied an intermediate spacer, and put a reference marker on the side of the
&gt;pickup body, so it would be easy to determine if you were in or out of
&gt;specification.
&gt;-The wires that come with it are way too long for the standard upright engine
&gt;application.
