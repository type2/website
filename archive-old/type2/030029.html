&gt; List,
&gt; I know this has been hashed out over the years, but searching the archives has

&gt; 
&gt; I recently acquired a 71 bus - advwag - with no engine.
&gt; Is the engine case a '1-year only' for the 71 because of the bosses for the
&gt; mustache bar?

No, a lot of VW cases are &quot;universal&quot;.  The bosses were there for type 3
and bus applications in the US '68 through '71 and they all used the
moustache bar. Euro buses came with type
1 engines through the entire bay production but the '72-up euro mustache
bar was different, IIRC. New Brasil cases have the bosses.

&gt; A buddy says i can use a type3 case for this thing as well - is this correct?
&gt; Are they the exact same case? There's a mustache bar in a type3, right?  Can i
&gt; use it in my bus?

The bars are different for the type 2 and type 3
