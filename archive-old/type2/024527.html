&gt;Because there have been some questions recently:
&gt;The '68-72 Westfalia The poptop in these years hinges at the front and
&gt;the canvas under it should have thre window, one in each face.

Just an FYI, an old friend of mine had a 68 westy he bought off a couple
in northern Michigan, which the couple may have bought new in Canada. It
had a full size rectagular pop-top which popped straight up, with no hammock,
but with a panel which slid out and slept 2 upstairs.
