Subject: Anyone Remember &quot;Hippie Green&quot; ?

Hey folks,
     Just got back from Mattos ( an auto body paint/supply store) Went to buy 
a quart of paint since my new doglegs are now primered and ready to paint. 
Two years ago when I painted my Westy, I bought the paint from Mattos, just 
ordered it by name, Sage Green. This time, however, they wanted a paint code, 
which I didn't have. So, they pull out the book, find the '76 VW section, and 
there is Sage Green, but the paint sample looks more like a dark army olive 
drab green. Below that was &quot;Hippie Green&quot;, which I don't ever recall seeing 
before. It was a much brighter green. There was also a Rallye Green, which 
I'm pretty sure was a Bug color. Now, the Sage Green Mattos mixed for me two 
years ago matched fairly well ( I painted the entire exterior), although it 
was slightly darker than the original paint on the interior. Whats left of 
the paint tag on mine says &quot;Tiage grun&quot; ( I think). Any paint experts out 
there to shed any light on this?    TIA,  Jeff S.
