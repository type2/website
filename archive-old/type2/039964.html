Hi All

The good news is today my new sway bars arrived.

Bad news is, when I was looking them over I realized
I had no clue how to install them and they didn't come
with instructions.

If someone has mounted these babies recently on a '71 Westy
(or close to it) would you please ping me a procedure? I can
probably figure out the front since there is one there, but the 
back is a total mystery to me. 

Thanks in advance,

Pete
