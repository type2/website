&gt; Hey Kevin,
&gt; 
&gt; The EGR filter is not in the engine compartment, but underneath, on
&gt; the left
&gt; hand side, just above the valve cover. If it's not there, then it
&gt; fell off
&gt; and chances are that your engine is sucking in fresh air through the
&gt; hole
&gt; (not a good thing, as lean running causes overheating). This theory
&gt; is also
&gt; consistent with the symptoms you describe: the engine stalling when
&gt; too
&gt; lean. This may not as much a problem on the cold engine because the
&gt; open
&gt; aux. bypass valve acts on the AFM to provide a lightly richer
&gt; mixture.

I'd replace the coil as well, since the spark seems to be weak at first
and probably doesn't get any better as the coil gets warm.  Coils
aren't all that expensive, and if the new one doesn't fix the problem
then you can just add it to the parts box for future use.
