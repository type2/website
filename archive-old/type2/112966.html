Subject: Re: Condenser/point vs. humidity/rain

Thanks Bill, nice of you to teply.

 &gt;&gt;&gt;Coulda been the condensor, coulda been the points. Did you check the 
point gap before swapping?&lt;&lt;&lt;

Sorry for my poor English but  &quot;coulda&quot; mean possible or not possible??? 
the gap was .020-025mm and 50dwell before, but the point had corosion on 
it with some pitting???  The bus as gain a 15-20% increase in power 
since i change the condensor and the point!

 &gt;&gt;&gt;From my experience, big bangs (not backfires) mean a combustable 
mixture got let out into the exhaust and went off there. A BACKFIRE is 
when something lights off the mixture while its coming into the 
cylinder- the exhaust valve is open combustion takes place in the 
INTAKE. Hence 'back fire' - fire going back UP the intake.&lt;&lt;&lt;

Well, big bang or backfire, it's unburn fuel for sure! it's no hot  head 
spot, heads are new, it's not the valve, they are at .006, all of them 
and it's not the carb! Am sure about that.

 &gt;&gt;&gt;From my experience, big bangs (not backfires) mean a combustable 
mixture got let out into the exhaust and went off there.&lt;&lt;&lt;

Ok, so how come the fuel mixture didn't burn in the combustion chamber, 
i would say bad ignition when engine is cold and humid, why? Remember, 
same problem with both carb(s), Solex and Weber. Couldn't be a slow 
moving distributor when cold???? Too much choke = too ritch mixture???? 
Bad fuel again (see my trip section)??? I have a brand new 009 on the 
shelf, and a spare 1973 stock Bosh!
Very funny when i start this van on a campgroung at 07:00 in the 
morning, i wake up all the campgroung, not talking about the heavy fuel 
smell... ;-(   Piss me off a bit.

 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What most people call 'backfire' is the result of poor sparks 
letting unburned mixture go out the exhaust.&lt;&lt;&lt;

Ok, so what make poor sparks? If anyone can answer that question i think 
he/her will find a solution to my problem(s). Not the plug (10k miles on 
it), wire=new... Not much left,  both of my coil are cooked??? don't 
think so! So there is only the point, condenser and distributor left.

Stupid Bus, that how i feel for now, it's taking too much of my energy 
and time, there is a limite somewhere.
I would take a 50/50 pleasure and paine, now it's more like 10/90 
(90=paine). I think am a pretty good mechanic, but now...am looking for 
a needle in a.... you know what.

So much controversy on this list about OEM parts vs. aftermarket, what 
to use wen a 30 years old part is finish... (distributor), no one says 
the same.

Yes, my 1700cc is now a rocket bus, but only when its hot and as finaly 
started after 2 hours, not funny at all.
Cheers, Ben
