IMHO making sure that a wire is connected at both ends is easy 
compared to some of the bizarre adjusting stuff.  Get a good wiring 
diagram, and sit down and have a good read.  Z Z Z z z z z Seriously 
look at the diagram and start with something simple and follow the 
path of electricity from battery to something you know.  Get a

Careful, don't use a 12v motor in a 6v bus or vice versa.  It took me 
awhile to track a problem with my 12v '67 sqbk wiper motor problem.  
Worked fine for awhile then stop. PO had put one from a junk yard in, 
labled '67, problem was THEY LIED.  It was a 6v wiper motor and the 
12v was overheating the motor and it would just stop until it cooled

Make real sure that you have the proper motor.

Have fun !
