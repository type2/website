In Fla my busses have all been exempt from mileage checking. I suppose
there is a cutoff year and pre-that I wouldnt think its a problem to
change it.


&gt; Also, somebody mentioned above not to mess with the odometer.  I really 
&gt; wouldn't worry about it.  Think about it, if you order a new speedo from say 
&gt; RMM, it will come with 0 miles on it.  Are you telling me that you need to 
&gt; roll it up to your previous mileage?  Also, these speedos only went up to 
&gt; 100k.  Who's to say it's at 70k or 570k after a full restoration that it 
&gt; sounds like he's doing?
