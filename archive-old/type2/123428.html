Subject: RE: [T2] oil temp gauge question

Howdy,

I routed my oil temp sender wire from the sump to the trans, up and over the 
trans, and along the driver's side frame rail.  Once I got it up front, I 
went through the body where the clutch pedal goes, routed it behind the kick 
panel, and ran it up to the wires under the dash.

One thing that may make things easier for you is to do 2 separate runs:  run 
the wires under the Bus to a point inside the passenger compartment, and run 
a separate set of wires from your gauges to the underbody wires.  That way 
you can get the gauges situated and wired, and put the dash back together.  
Then, once you get the wires run under the body, you just have to splice the 
2 wires together.

Good Luck!
