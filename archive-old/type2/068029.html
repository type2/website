Well, I bought a new 34PICT3 from RMMW a few months ago.  Once I
figured out that I really hadn't adjusted the idle control screw
properly and fixed that (symptom is the throttle sticking closed),
it's been an absolute dream.  Power when cold, runs cool, and just all
around happiness.  This despite various dire warnings I've from other
list members....

Unfortunately, I can't remember the price I paid.  I do know that it
was made by Brosol, aka in Brazil.
