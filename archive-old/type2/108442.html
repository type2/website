Subject: re removing Pitman arm and drag link end.

Re removing the Pitman arm from my 70 bus, and removing the drag link end from
it.
I have read through the archives and library. George Lyle bought a Chevy
puller and made an adapter plate. It is a nasty job, that seems clear enough.
Locally, only 1 or 2 places even seem to know what a Pitman arm puller is, and
the price was from $55-$64 for a tool that I will hopefully only ever use
once. Places like Harbour Freight have simple ones for like $6.99-7.99, but
the good ones seem to wrap right around the Pitman arm in a C shape.

1)    Is there a tool that can do both jobs? There are some adjustable
pullers, eg  JC Whipme seems to have one, although I swore I'd neverr deal
with them again.
2)    Can anyone point me to the exact right tool that will make this job a
snap, without having to fab any adapters or anything?

Insights helpful.
