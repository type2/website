Subject: Re: [T2] Whining bearing

&gt; I got a kombi which I drive on dirt roads in Kenya. Now the thing is I gotta a whine which I think is a wheel bearing on the front end. It gently vibrates through the floor as well. But I can't get which side it is. If I jack it up all the wheels (I checked the back as well just to be on the safe side) feel firm, no wobble at all top to bottem. So is there any way I can find which one it is without pulling them apart and looking to see if I have any ball bearings looking rough?

if one bearing is going bad the other is probably not too far behind, I
would do both
