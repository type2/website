Subject: Re: [T2] a place for multi weight oil?

237k is far more than the wear point of any item in an engine.  If it 
only has an occassional drip it is amazing.    The basic facts of wear 
and physics apply to engines as well as the laws of probability.  with 
that many parts all in constant change of flux from temp and stress and 
friction as well as chemical probability starts to creep in real quick.  
a minor flaw in part a can cause part x on the other end of an engine to 
blow.   I have seen engineering articles that stated the odds of any 
automotive engine hitting 100k was very small.  this dated back to the 
mid 80s.  there was a note in the article that stated that changing 
heads at something like 50k would reduce risk of engine failure.  the 
vast percentage of engine failures i have seen AC or WC have been heads

&gt; I highly doubt that the oil was the culprit here.
&gt; I would think it's more likely that the 237,000 miles had something to
&gt; do with the seal leaking issue---like dried up seals do have a tendancey
&gt; to weep a bit, and with that kind of milage I'm sure it has something
