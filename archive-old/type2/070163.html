Subject: Water pump&lt;g&gt; and oil sender stuff

Well, i pulled apart eh water pump in my 69 westy today, to see why it 
doesnt work.
It seems to hae a bit of buidup in it, and the deal in the pumping 
mechanism is a bit loose, i waas wondering how i could clean the crap 
outta the pump, and maybe where to find a replacement seal?

and, i changed the oil in the bus, and w/o the rain atleast, it seems rto 
work better. &lt;btw, oil change had already been schedualed for today, 
since old oil smelt a little toasted.&gt;

oh, and anyone know how to test the brakelight switches? or will i have 
to devise my own scheme? &lt;preferable w/o a multitester..:)&gt; 'casue i need 
to narrow down the problem further. the bulbs and contacts are good. 
alredy checked that...&lt;and fixed the horn, blinkers, and finiky reverse 
lights..&gt;

thanks in advance......david
