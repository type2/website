&gt; So I just bought my first VW (1971 westy in stunning condition) last week

&gt; holding me back are the locks on the doors.  The key that I have manages to
&gt; open the drivers side door, but doesn't turn in any of the other locks...
&gt; It also starts the ignition.  This leads me to believe that it actually is
&gt; meant _only_ to start the ignition and that there is supposed to be another
&gt; key (which has been lost along the years) that opens the doors.  The
&gt; driver's side door lock is probably just so worn down that it works with the
&gt; wrong key anyway.

A '71 should have only one key for all locks.  It's possible that some of
the locks could have been changed.

You can (carefully) remove the cylinders and juggle the wafers into
different holes to match your keys.  IF you put your key into the lock
before pulling the cylinder out you won't lose any wafers.

You can find more on this in the archives.
