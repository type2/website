Just noticed that this was posted on the www.VWVortex_dot_com. site.  this has
been a great site and very helpful in using their material in a small
newsletter.  They will be sorely missed and hope every one on the list had
the chance to visit the site.  It has been tyhe site that brought the
cutting edge VW stories and news when nothing could be had from VW.  I will
miss Doug, Jamie, Chuck and the gang at VWvortex very much.

this was a post from this morning on the VW vortex
http://www.vwvortexforums_dot_com/forums.html

   It has been a tough decision that Jamie and I have anguished over for a
few weeks now. The many server problems and traffic isses have become
increasingly difficult to keep up with and the cost has become prohibitive.
Combined that with the fact that it looks like I will be moving to New York
with the recent buyout of the company I work for, and the future of the
website and the magazine is bleak.
We loved putting this site together for all of you over the past 3 years,
and we look forward to seeing all of you at the car shows over the summer.
It has been a great run, and thanks for being a part of the fantastic growth
of this website.

The site will be going off the air for good at the end of the day tomorrow.
Enjoy what you can until then. Good luck to all of you in whatever you may
do.

-doug, jamie, chuck and the gang at VWvortex
