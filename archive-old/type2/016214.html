OK, pulled the engine on my '72 this weekend to replace
the front main seal. Went well (thanks for the help
Rob). But now, there is a noise I haven't heard before.
This is *only* after the bus is warmed up (20+ minutes
of steady driving). When I let off the pedal (to shift,
brake, etc.) there is a whirring, buzzing noise from
the engine that lasts for just a second. The best I can
describe it is a like a cricket. I can replicate the
noise in my driveway if I rest my foot on the pedal and
let it go *just* above idle. 

A few facts: '72 1700 engine running a 009 dizzy (yes,
I still have the correct dual vac advance dizzy in my
glove box), Weber dbl bbl progressive. We pulled the engine, removing only the carb and manifold, replaced
the seal, and put it back in. I then adjusted the 
valves the next morning.

The bus runs strong. Good acceleration, no loss of 
speed up hills in 4th. Able to leap tall buildings in 
a single bound. 

I plan to check for exhaust leak and vacuum leak. I
have not head this sound before. Maybe I should let
my conscience be my guide... ?

Any other suggestions?
