Subject: voltage reg bad??

alright... i'll be quick with this.
69 westfalia...brand spankin new mexican motor (new oil pressure sensor
included).. i've been workin on this beast the past few days getting
everything in order..  i  took the carb off to clean it some more...
then put it back on.... before this i noticed that the oil light would
no longer light...but the gen light would (just before you start the
motor...in the &quot;on&quot; position)  i thought...wiring maybe...
then...i put the carb back on (irrelevant really) went to start it...and
NOTHING.  no click...no zap...no grinding..nothing.  But...the gen light
was still on....but no oil light.
I'm thinking bad voltage regulator as everything is hooked up at the
starter...and there were no signs of a weak starter or anything before
this happened.

what are the possibilities?  It was ok one minute...and not ok the next.

thanks!
Isaiah
