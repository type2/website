Subject: Re: [T2] Type 4 Thermostat

what makes sense if making do with what's available.

BTW, my recollection of &quot;rube goldberg&quot; is making a device to accomplish a
desired task, in as roundabout and nonsensical way as possible. Also, your
remark of &quot;duct tape and bailing wire&quot; is where the &quot;ghetto engineering&quot;
definition of your in context reference came from.

Go ahead and criticize the rest of us all you want for our mis-use of your
terminology, and different values on keeping our cars on the road.
