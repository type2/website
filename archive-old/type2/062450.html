&gt;Last November, I bought a 1978 Green VW Westfalia that had been sitting
&gt;in a field for about 2 years.  I have learned that shortly before it was
&gt;parked, new cylinders and pistons were installed.  The bus had an oil
&gt;leak after the new pistons, etc. and the owner, out of frustration,
&gt;parked it.  I pulled the bus out and got it cranked.  It seemed to run
&gt;okay but I soon noticed it pumping oil out of the dipstick tube.

Sounds like it might have excessive blowby.  This could be caused by the
rings not seating, or the breather box might just be plugged.  I'd check
the compression first - maybe take it in for a leakdown test.

&gt;       The bus had factory a/c which has been disconnected, the
&gt;compressor is just lying on the left side of the engine, where the
&gt;other battery goes.  There is a cut out of the sheet metal on the left
&gt;side of the engine, apparently where the compressor used to be. Is it
&gt;harmful to run the engine with this sheet metal missing.

Is that a question.  It's not going to kill it in the near term, but you
should fix it as soon as possible to keep hot air from underneath the bus
from being sucked in by the fan.

&gt;        I'm dying to get it on the road.  The VW mechanics I have asked
&gt;about it have chuckled when I mention the year model and the type 4
&gt;engine and have been no help.

I understand your anxiety, but try to take it slow and fix what ails your
engine before you drive it.  Luckily you have the fuel injection, which is
a lot less trouble than the earlier dual carbs.  You can either dig in,
learn all about your engine, and fix it yourself, or pay someone else
thousands of dollars to do it for you.  I chose the former, and if I had it
to do all over again, I honestly don't know if I would have.  :-)  Ooooh, I
can't believe I just said that!

I remember right before I bought my bus, one of my mom's friends wanted to
sell me their full sized Ford van with a camper conversion in it
(fiberglass roof, stove, fridge, sink, etc) for $500 with a shot
transmission.  It was only about 10 years old, immaculate shape.  A real
bargain at that price.  I was scared away by the automatic, the V-8, and
the bad gas mileage, and wound up with my '73 Safare instead.  I often
wonder what would have happened if I had decided to buy that van instead?
Would I be a member of the Ford camper mailing list?  Would I be camping
with a group of retirees?  :)
