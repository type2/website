Congratulations.  You've just passed the VW IQ test.  If you want
reasonable performance in a Westy, the 78/79s are the ones to buy.  If
comfort is more important, the 80 -83 Vanagons are more civilized, but
they're awfully heavy, which makes them slow and gives poor economy.  I've
had both, and I really can't say which one I prefer.  In gas stations, the
'79.  At night, the '82.
