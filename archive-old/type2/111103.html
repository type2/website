Hello,

I am putting on my flame suit here...Does TypeII have
a Paypal account? If they did, I would give on a
regular basis. I know it sounds pretty lazy, but it is
the truth. Is there any way one could be set up?
Thanks!

Regards,
David Kelly

&gt; Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; I've sent $75 to Ted tonight and I hope some of you
&gt; will match it.
&gt; 
&gt; It costs a little over five dollars a day to keep
&gt; type2_dot_com/vintagebus_dot_com
&gt; running.... Please
&gt; send anything you can.
&gt; Five dollars is perfectly fine. Anything is fine.
 The thing is to put it in an envelope and put a
&gt; stamp on it and SEND IT.
&gt; It's not hard to get people to donate but it's very
&gt; hard to get you to
&gt; remember to actually SEND IT..
&gt; 
&gt; Thx,
&gt;
