Subject: Re: [T2] got Her running!

ahhh ok just got another reply to my post...
so looks like i can go home tonight and set the valves and then redo the timing then..

so let me get this right..
i must make sure that she is running ...
once running i can set the valves and then go back and sreset the timing again...

the timing is still pretty far off... is that not going to hurt the valves..?
thanks

&gt;&gt;the valves will also have to be set after the timing is correct,...
&gt;
&gt;The valves have to be adjusted before the timing. At least now it's running, so do the valve adjustment, then re-do the timing.
