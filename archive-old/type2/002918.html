Subject: [T2] Steering box for '70 Westy


&gt; I have a 1970 Westy that is in great shape - no rust! Of course the door
and
&gt; window rubber is old and cracking and the interior is somewhat trashed but
&gt; the mechanics and body couldn't be better except for the steering problem.
&gt; Replaced the ball joints and shocks, greased up everywhere there was a
&gt; fitting, checked all the linkages and tightened up the steering box (maybe
a
&gt; little too tight) and I still have some front end floating or wandering
once
&gt; I get to 40+ mph. Could it be I need a new/rebuilt steering box? I read
&gt; somewhere that tight ball joints could cause this kind of problem too or
am
&gt; I taking the bait?
&gt; Any how if I need a steering box what would you folks recommend as a
&gt; trustworthy vendor that sells reliable steering boxes that have been
&gt; properly reconditioned/rebuilt with proper and substantial bushings etc. I
&gt; have heard stories about some suppliers with poor rebuild and quality
&gt; control. Sure would appreciate the collective knowledge and experience
from
&gt; the group.
