Subject: Re: [T2] oil breather hose diameter?

I just replaced this hose on my 79 and assuming it's the same size I
just replaced it with a 3/4&quot; radiator hose that had a nice 90 degree
bend in it. It was a little tight and the hose wall is larger, but so
far it seems to be working fine.

&gt; Does anyone know the correct size for the braided rubberhose which runs
&gt; from the oil breather to the intake on a 78'. I think it is 22mm but I am
&gt; not sure, dont have bus or caliper handy, and want to stop by parts store
&gt; on way home from work to get hose.
