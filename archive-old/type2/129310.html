Subject: Re: [T2] Timing Issues

Also, don't assume it's the normal distributor.  Make sure it is!  And 
if it is the correct distributor, the vacuum line won't make much 
difference while you're timing around idle.  It will affect your max 
advance, though.  Without the hose, it's pretty much like an 009, if you 
want to see what everyone is &quot;raving&quot; about.. hahaha

&gt; Well theres a vacuum canister, so it must be the normal distributor.  I 
&gt; dont have a hose that fits the vacuum advance right now, so I have it 
&gt; plugged at the carb.  Should that make much of a difference at idle? I 
&gt; wouldnt think so.  Im gonna go attack all the intake connections, as
