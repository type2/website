Subject: Re: [T2] Anyone fitted a sunroof in a poptop

Hi Lee,

You can't get there from here.

The late westy (74-91) have no roof behind the driver's seat:
http://www.pottsfamily_dot_ca/westfakia/creation/pictures/agf00002_12.html

Adding a &quot;factory original&quot; sunroof would require a complete transplant of the
roof section from an original Sunroof bus, which is the same job as converting
a transporter to a westy. *That* took me about 100 hours back in the winter of
2000. (A professional could probably do the job in a quarter of that time).

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; I know it sounds a little weird, but has anyone fitted a sunroof to 
&gt; the poptop in a late westy ?
