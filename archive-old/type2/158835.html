&gt; I'm helping a friend track down an oil leak on a stock 1600 engine. As I

&gt; I've never seen one that was not a straight open pipe, but this one is 
&gt; so perfectly crimped that it is hard for me to believe that it was done 
&gt; by an amateur.

Are you sure it it actually part of the metal pipe? Stock engines are 
&quot;supposed&quot; to have a little rubber end that is crimped so that extra 
engine pressure is allowed to escape the case, but it should not suck in 
any bad things from outside. This might be what it is.
