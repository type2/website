	Subject: Middle and Back seats for a =?iso-8859-1?q?Bus=3F?=

	I recently purchased a 74 Bus with no middle or back seats. (imagine
	that)  Anyway I know getting original VW seats will be hard to find
	and cost alot.  I was wondering if anyone has used other bench seats
	from other vehicles and got a good safe fit. I'm thinking the Ford
	Aerostar seats might work with alittle modification.  Has anyone
done
	this.  Trying to find a VW Bus in a junk yard is impossible in my
	area.  Thanks for any input.

Aerostars, and most other modern vans, have a completely different mounting
system that uses a claw that clasps onto a bar mounted below surface level
of the floor.  Its pretty cool in that it makes the seats easy to remove and
allow boxes and such to be slid in without bothersome mounting hardware
being in the way.  But getting a system like that to work in a VW Bus would
seem to be more trouble than its worth.  You'd have to figure out a way to
get rid of the claw feet entirely or cut holes in your floor and weld in the
recessed bars to accept the claws.
