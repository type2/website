Subject: Re: [T2] rebuilt distributors???

this is NOT CORRECT. Optimal timing under certain conditions is 42-45 BTDC
(light load, high RPM). The &quot;rule&quot; of no more then 32 only applies to
centrifugal ONLY distributors, because they have no load-sensing
capabilities (vacuum advance), so you have to time for &quot;worst case&quot;, which
is full throttle (full load).

putting a centrifugal only distributor on a variable load engine
(automotive) is a huge mistake, but they are relatively inexpensive and do
&quot;work&quot;, depending on your definition of &quot;work&quot;. What may fit you definition,
certainly doesn't fit mine.

If you have a bus running a 009, if you put the proper curve in it, you'll
gain 2-4mpg and drop the oil temps 20 degrees, ON THE HIGHWAY at a steady
speed from 1/4 to 1/2 throttle.

&gt; On the stock type4 engine total advance should never be past 32 degrees.
