Subject: [T2] 5200 Holley

I think I busted a new hole in the front tin and ran the gas cable to the
other side of the carb when installing a
Holley 'bugspray' on my 73. It worked okay. I do remember that the choke
element was facing the rear, and
directly under that was the big fact spring loaded adjustment screw. I was
able to buy a rebuild kit for it by the
way, went to FLAPS and they ordered it, came with the all important base
gasket that goes between the carb
and the box it sits on. port on the front of the box for the brake servo
hose.

If anyone was planning on driving into the middle of New York City and
throwing a rod through the top of their
case in the near future, scratch my name off the AIRS list, as I'm quitting
my job as of today and moving to California
on Sunday. I'll be driving a giant U-haul full of furniture (mostly vw
parts) towing a tan&amp;white 72 bus along route 81south/40west, so if you see
me, be sure to hit the horn and give me the finger, as I'll need a good
laugh. I can still
be reached at:  motorhole at aol_dot_com  -  will give a trip report on only
the two back wheels of the bus when I arrive.
