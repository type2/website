&gt; I think I found what used to be a pilot bearing. This bearing goes in the

You've found it.  Getting it out might require some creative engineering.
There are pullers that get behind the bearing and then let you use a
slide-hammer to pull it out, but you might have to resort to a sharp
chisel to cut down the side of it.  I once reground a chisel to have an
angled point for this job.  Just remember to chisel on the bearing shell,
not the crankshaft metal!

When you put in the new bearing, remember to put it in so that it is flush
with the end of the crank.  If you put it in further it will be harder to
remove next time.
