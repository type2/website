Subject: Re: [T2] ok to drive w/o &quot;r&quot;

If the reverse gear has slipped out of engagement with
the key that slides it into and out of engaging, then
the gear is floating on the shaft and can engage /
disengage depending on the attitude of the bus. If I
remember correctly, a nose-down position disengages it
whereas a nose-up position could engage it. There is
the possibility it could get really ugly really
suddenly! -BaH

 get a friend's place tomorrow, about 150 miles round
 trip.
