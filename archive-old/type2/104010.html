&gt; The only proper mixture adjustment is at idle. If that is set right, all

&gt; ignition timing and energy. If it doesn't seem to be running right with
&gt; idle co at 2% max, something else is wrong. Start playing with the

Doktor Tim,

I agree with you, but I also disagree. Here's why:

I agree that the idle mixture has to be right on, and you don't need a
rolling road to set idle mixture.

I disagree that you will NECESSARILY screw up your AFM by putting the bus on
a dyno and tweeking the flapper spring. I have yet to see an AFM that had
not had the cover taken off and gooped back on with sillycone. So someone
has already messed with most of them, what Randy is trying to do is put it
right again. The '79 Cal FI system is pretty resilient in terms of the
flapper adjustment. Since it has lambda control, the mixture is adjusted by
the ECU, unlike federal models. In fact the dyno setup procedure is more
applicable to a federal bus than a Cal bus, if you will, since flapper
maladjustment on a non-lambda bus can result in really poor mixtures either
rich or lean. Lambda busses do not have this problem as much.

I would say that done properly with the specs nearby and a careful hand,
rolling road tuning is an excellent idea. There is so much more you look at
if the motor is under load and at various rpms than if it is just idling.
That is why engine builders use dyno testing - it works. You just have to
know what you are doing...
