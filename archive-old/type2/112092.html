bore = large torque.  Same for farm tractors)

&gt; The answer is that torque does not really depend upon bore or stroke.
Torque is more-or-less proportional to displacement and the 2.0 has more
displacement.  Displacement is the highest-order factor in torque
production.  The design of the intake tract is also very important.  Bore
vs. stroke has a relatively minor impact on the amount of torque
produced, although it is important in terms of where in the rpm range
&gt;peak torque is produced.

If you really want to get pedantic about it, torque is porportional to the
square of the bore and linearly porportional to the stroke and brake mean
effective pressure above the piston.  The BMEP is related to the
compression ratio.

So, you can increase torque by increasing any of these quantities.
