Subject: Re: balljoint rubbers

&gt; The rubber around one upper balljoint of my van is leaking grease.
&gt; I presume I need to replace this fairly quickly. Is it an easy job?
&gt; Should I replace all the rubbers while I am at it? Do I have to
&gt; replace the whole ball joint or take the torsion arm off?
&gt; 
Although still available a few years ago, new boots with their
clip rings will set you back like $25 each, in the US a balljoint
new in boot is $20 or so, you do the figuring.  You got to remove
the spindles either way, pulling the arms and taking em to somebody
to press in/out the joints isn't much more effort and likely
you need new joints anyway.  And replace em now, we wouln't want
them balljoints gettin pregnant (sorry evil jibe at Brit terminology)
