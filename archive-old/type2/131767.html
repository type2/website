Subject: '77 Manual Tranny into '73 Bus

How difficult of a job are we talking. I am looking at the possibility of 
installing a '77 Tranny into a '73 bus. Is just a matter of changing the 
nose cone? Or are there other issues ie linkage, mounts, parts that need to 
be modified?

Thanks,

Michael Knight
