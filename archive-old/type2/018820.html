Well... I read somewhere on the web that the Y2k issue will boost my gas
mileage to 38mpg.  (probably because my calculator isn't Y2k compliant
;-)

Seriously - look at the archives - the EFI doesn't know what time it is

BUT.. A friend of mine painted &quot;Y2K Compliant&quot; on the back of his 64
truck.  Kinda humorous
