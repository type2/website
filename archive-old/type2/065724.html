Grumpy update on the $129 underbody job:

It was too good to be true. As you may recall, I thought Ziebart did a
great job
on restoring the luster and shine on my badly oxidized Yosemite Yellow
breadloaf. So I talked to the guy and we discussed treating the
underside, where he quoted me $129 to (1) remove the old undercoating,
(2) treat any surface rust that might be uncovered with a rust
conversion product, and (3) apply a fresh layer of undercoating.

$129 did seem like a great deal, considering how many lonely, dirty,
hours I would have spent just doing part (1), so I made doubly sure
that they really pay attention to detail and work on all the nook and
cranies. I told them they could keep the bus as long as they wished,
provided they did the job right, already feeling like a pest. I was
assured that I didn't need to worry, they've been doing this for 15
years, they have all the tools, yada, yada. 

So I picked up the bus on Monday and once home, checked their work
with a flashlight. Not only was there some messy overspray, but they
clearly hadn't removed all of the old undercoating, not even much of
the loose stuff. Air pockets could easily be spotted and I uncovered a
few with a scraper. Needless to say, I was highly pissed, and gave
them a call. They said &quot;no problem, just bring it in, show us where
there's a problem and we'll do it right.&quot; 

They did fix the obvious today and cleaned up most of the mess, but
the damage is done. In all likelihood, some rusty areas have been left
untreated and been covered up with the black goop.

What I learned: 

(1) Next time I'll put things in writing, i.e., type up a *precise*
and unmistakably clear description of the job I want to have done and
have the manager please sign it.

(2) Come back after phase (1) and inspect the undercarriage *before*
they apply anything. To me, this is quite an awkward thing to do, but
to keep things diplomatic, I might tell them I need to inspect my car
for rust and structural damage, which isn't a lie anyway.
