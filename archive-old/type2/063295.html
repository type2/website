Subject: Getting the '77 into shape...questions

hey now,

well, on monday we go to pick up the van and will put it at the back of
the driveway for much needed washings, waxings, and a major tuneup/checkout.

i'm going to do the following and would you folks to add anything i might miss
since i'm not at all familiar with fuel injectionL

a) drain old icky oil and put in 10w30 since fall is almost here.

b) change oil filter and install bosch oil filter.

c) check valves

d) timing is perfect.

e) check fuel lines. i'm not sure if the lines are different on a '77 then
on a '74. replace as a matter of precaution. what fuel lines should i look for?

f) install fuel filters...would in between the tank and fuel pump be okay...and
i normally put one in between the pump and carb as well...but since i don't
carbs on the '744 :-) i was wondering if i needed a second one.

g) replace cheap battery with new, better one.

h) look into getting second battery. if anyone has the latest thread on battery
selection, etc could you send it to me?

i) new spark plugs

j) check spark plug wires

k) clean engine. now this raises the question...i've heard getting all them
wires off is a chancey deal.._dot_can i mark them and then disconnect so i can
clean the engine better?

l) replace broken cv boot and inspect cv joint.

m) check thermostat. stefan noticed that when the engine was warm, the
thermostat didn't open. opinions on that?

n) replace starter. i've seen bosch starters going for about $120 in the
catalogs. is this about right? i didn't think starters cost this much. any
other options?

o) clean poptop. this leads me to another question: how sturdy is the top? when
it's down can you get on top of it and not fall through?and how much weight
can the upper bed take?

p) drink a cold beer while sitting in the swivel seat looking at the plaid
interior.

anything else i should do? any help would be appreciated!
