&quot;We have a standard '71 that only starts when it feels like it.  Turn
the
key, you get gas gauge, other dash activation, but no turn over,&quot;...

I had/have the same thing happening with my bus, and have had this sort
of thing happen with 2 other bugs over the years. As far as the bus is
concerned it's the wiring to the starter from the key. It's long, old,
and doesn't carry the voltage that it used to when it was new...which
kind of applies to me as well but that's a different story for a
different list...

I could rewire the whole thing but it'd be a HUGE pain, and the thing is
it generally starts right up if I just turn it off and then back on.
Eventually I'll change it out when I get some time.
