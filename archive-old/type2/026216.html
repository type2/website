	I am posting this to both lists because I have a '66 bus with a '71
engine.  My starter\solenoid is letting me down more and more often. When I
had to crawl under there and whack the solenoid wearing a shirt and tie the
other day, I realized it was probably time to put in a new starter\solenoid.
My question: As stated it's a '66 bus with a 1600 DP engine from a '71.
	Which starter should I get? I believe it still has the original 6
volt starter because there is a strange little box\transformer thingy wired
in line just before the starter (I'm guessing a voltage drop??) Should I get
a 12 volt starter for a '71 or get a new '66 starter and keep the voltage
drop thingy there.  If my best bet is to get the '71 starter, could someone
give me a quick description of how this should be wired?? 

[...] The strange little box is most likely a hard start relay.  Pull your
starter.  If it says 6 volt get a 6 volt starter, otherwise get 12 volt.  It
has to match up to the teeth on your flywheel -- unless you want to pull the
engine and put in a 12 volt flywheel.  6 volt starters in a 12 volt system
will eventually fail but you help longevity by cleaning up all your grounds
(particularly the tranny to body ground).  Bad grounding is probably why the
hard start relay was put there in the first place.
