&gt; I need an instrument panel for my 71 bus,
&gt; I found one in the paper for $100.  It includes
&gt; speedo, gas gauges, all lights.  It is in good
&gt; condition.&lt;&lt;

No way, not even CLOSE to a good price, unless the
clock is include and it works or the rest of the bus
is included!!  Look at thesamba_dot_com classifieds and
I'll bet you can find one for $10, maybe $20.
