Subject: Re: [T2] Re; Parcel Trays

Gee, I didn't mean to stir up the &quot;hornet's nest&quot; with my suggestion
yesterday on BBI Parcel Trays.
 I wish I was a tenth as mechanically creative as my late father was when
building stuff like this from scratch for our VWs and he did it on a large
scale. Being a tool and die machinist on minimum pay in the 60s &amp; 70s and
said experience in T&amp;D both forced and allowed him to create wonderful
things for his (and my) ride(s). One of many things I miss about him, but
that's another story and I digress.
 Mark, Tony &amp; Dan are apparently such the same persons and I not only
respect that, I really dig it as well.
 For those not so mechanically creative or don't have the equipment (and
experience) that Tony apparently has, save yer dimes and nickels and buy
one.
 my nickel's woth (inflation y'know)
 :-)
