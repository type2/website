I have a  chance to buy a 1978 bug convertible $500...solid car ...minor 
surface  rust ...new tires ...new brakes all around...it was on the road in  
2004...it has a bad cylinder...I have a friend who has a complete set of 4  
new jugs 
...4 pistons with rings...and new push rod tubes $150...all still  in the 
box...all I need is a gasket set...does this sound like a good  price for  
the car ?
Thanks 
Jim in NY



That sounds like a great price .  Look to see if there is any rust on  the 
frame head.
