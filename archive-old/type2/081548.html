 I made a pressure brake bleeder from a one gallon garden sprayer
for about 10 bucks. If you drill a hole in the top near the shoulder=20
you can install a threaded tire valve stem so that you can charge it=20
with your air compressor. Then you can have so much pressure=20
that when the m.c. cap fails, you can rapidly coat your interior
with brake fluid! (maybe the hand pump would have been good enough!)
=20
 Actually I made this originally to pressurize the oil system on my
rebuilt engine prior to initial startup.
