&gt; I have *never* pulled a 2 liter with FI.  does anyone have experience they 
&gt; can pass on to this newbie on what I should and shouldn't do, how to keep all 
&gt; the wires straight, and stuff?
&gt; 

get a few extra hands, that bugger is HEAVY

. mark every hose and wire.  (do it anyway)
. don't forget to take off the coil AND bracket
. don't forget  the accelerator linkage, it can be bent if you forget 
        especially if it is an automatic
. also if it is an automatic you have to drain the tranny and remove the
dipstick tube (ignore if manual)
. don't forget there are TWO fuel lines on a fuel injected engine, need to
disconect and plug both

it will take twice as long as planned

the rest is pretty obvious

good luck
Bob
