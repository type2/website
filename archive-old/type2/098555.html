Most likely candidate is your windshield seal/frame.

Pull the kickpanels off (actually, you may not need to..), setup your
favorite sprinkler (or use a helper with a hose..) to spray the windshield
of your bus.  Crawl inside and, with a flashlight, look under the dash and
around the nose of the bus.

Eventually you should find signs of water leaking...follow that to its

Take a look at the archives and the library for information on repairing
these areas.
