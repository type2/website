Subject: 77 Rear Drum Brakes

I am putting new brakes on my 77 bus and I am not sure how to tell if I have 
the new brakes lined up properly or not. In the past all the drum brakes I 
have worked on had the retaining springs in the middle to hold them in place, 
but these do not. The Bentley and Hayes Manuel are of no help as all the 
brakes they show have the center retaining springs. Please let me know what 
to look for when lining them up.
