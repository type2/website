Subject: [T2] JRMBBC II  site update

    Hello everyone,

 I've updated the JRMBBC II site to include a map.

go to http://my.treeway_dot_com/OKArt

and click on JRMBBC.

Directions: From OKC and points north...get on I-35 south, exit 51, turn to
right, about 1 1/2 miles on the right.

&gt;From Dallas and points south...get on I-35 north, exit at exit 47 (not
48..there isn't one!!) turn left, follow road for 3 1/2 miles, park entrance
on west side of road.

Be sure to tell the folks at the gate that you are with the Josh Rogers
group to get the group discount. Cost is $5 per person, per night. If you
want an electrical hook up, the cost is $10 more per night.

Hope to see everyone there!!
