Subject: Re: [T2] HOSED by a transport company!

&gt;so now i am stuck with a bus that MUST leave phonix for west texas by monday, and to make things more exciting, the people i am &gt;renting the moving truck from (budget) have no more trailers or dollies for this weekend. 
 
any suggestions? 
   
Same thing happened to us when moving from Seattle to Charleston.  We finally gave in and just drove the bus the whole was (changing the timing every ten minutes or so going over the rockies).  You can, however tow a trailer from another company behind your truck.  Try uhaul yet?  Elsewise. . .bribe a friend.
