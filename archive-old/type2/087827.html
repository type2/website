Subject: Re: [T2] burnt bus

Pat,

Very very sorry to hear of your loss. When I restored my bus I took it by a
Korean mechanic I respect who has done some work on my other cars but speaks
little English..

After a lengthy look he had one adamant word of advice. &quot;Clamps,&quot; he said,
pointing to the fuel lines. I had good fuel lines but had no clamps. &quot;Fire.&quot;
he said, shaking his head.

With many years in the business and probably m ore than a few burned vws
under his belt, Paek knew the primary cause of disastrous fires--fuel lines
that come loose. A fuel line that comes literally pumps gas into the engine
compartment.

Paul, I hope your bused was totally covered by insurance and you will be on
the road again. I am glad to know you got everyone out safely.

In sympathy,

John Rogers

&gt; Do not ever think it will not happen to you.  On the way back from the
&gt; ReUnion campout, my bus burned to the ground.  I had changed some of the
&gt; fuel lines but not all.  I was just west of The Dalles when I smelled gas
&amp;
&gt; less then a minute later smoke was pouring from the heater vents &amp; flames
&gt; from the back.  I got my sleeping wife &amp; son out safely.  I grabbed my
&gt; wallet &amp; fire extinguisher but there was no putting the fire out.  It
burnt
&gt; so quickly, it was unbelievable.  Since my camera burned with the bus, I
&gt; have no pictures but will get some to post as a warning to all.  Change
your
&gt; fuel lines.
