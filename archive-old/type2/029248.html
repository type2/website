Well, I'm not freaking out, but I can't say I'm totally thrilled with the first 16.5 minutes of running my bus. Bottom line: too many oil leaks; sounds like there's an exhaust leak, and the oil pressure was dropping too rapidly for my taste.

Details follow:

I ran her up to about 2000 rpm (by ear) and held her there for about a minute. Shut her down to go check the back. Yep oil, but not too bad; probably pushrod seals, which I RTV'd before reading in the archives that I should not.

Ran her back up to 2000-by-ear again. Hmmm, she started right up...alternator's charging. I noticed on startup that the oil pressure was about 50 psi at 2000 RPM. I got her to hang (sticky accelerator cable) and ran for about 8 more minutes while I wandered around with the fire extinguisher in my hand. Nosey neighbors tried not to look concerned. They're gossiping about me--I just know it! I decided I wanted to check for burning wires among the break-in smoke, which was now mixed with oil smoke from the heat exchangers. I can't tell if it's coming mostly from the pushrods or from the valve covers. I stopped her, just after noting oil pressure was down to around 30 or so. Temp was around 200.

Checked things out; decided to go back up before I loose the benefit of the breakin period. Ran her up to 2000-by-ear again. Cable wouldn't stick anymore, so I propped the pedal with a motorcycle battery that just happened to be beside the driver's seat. Ran another 8 minutes or so...laying on the ground by the engine part of the time, walking up to check gauges part of the time. At about 16 minutes total run time, the oil temp was at 220 and the oil pressure was all the way down around 20. When I removed the battery, she dropped down to about 11 to 13 psi. I didn't like that at all. Revved her back up and she climbed to around 25 or 30. Still, this worried me a little, so I backed off and shut her down.

Came in and ate dinner; then went out and checked the oil--down maybe 1/2 quart on the dipstick, but she's still pretty warm. A lot of oil leaked, but not 1/2 quart, I don't think. Temp gauge reads 150 or so. Fired her up and checked the oil pressure gauge as I reved her. Without winding her out, pressure goes up to 50 psi. Idle at this temp is around 20 psi. Idle isn't very smooth. A distinct air sucker sound that makes me think there's an exhaust leak...but the exhaust should be nice and tight. I paid attention to that. Maybe it's just been too long since I heard a bus...and i've never hear a 2.0 liter before.

I'm running 10w-30. I may not have adjusted the valves well before startup, but they're hydraulic, so I don't figure it matters all that much. I'll talk Ken into coming by tomorrow maybe with his timing stuff. He's got a knack for getting it dead on and a really good ear for leaks and such. 

I'll get under the bus and check on these leaks. I'll plan Saturday and Sunday to fix these and get everything else installed. I think I can go to the inspection station on Saturday, but not if there's any smoke...where there's smoke in TN, there's no inspection.

Please feel free to suggest other things to check next. I'll probably try to isolate the leaks before I install the axles. I left them off until now just in case I had to remove the engine again. CVs are too awkward to just be moving about willy nilly...specially when there's no real reason to.

Thanks! Joe
