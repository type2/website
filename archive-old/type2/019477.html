Hi Dave,
    The heads sent to me by Mark Stephen's High Performance for my 74 1800 came
with two big holes in both heads.  Other than valve size, the 74 heads also had
sodium filled exhaust valves as standard equipment.  However, at $63.00 a pop
compared to $13.00 each, most rebuilders (as did Mark Stephens) took a pass on
sodium filled exhaust valves. It is only a matter of plugging a passage to
interchange a left with a right head.  The 1800 heads can be used on a 2.0 liter if
you plug all 4 passages as you can do on the 1800 to lose the AIR system.
Actually, Mark Stephens drilled and tapped a set of 2.0 liter heads to supply my
1800 needs.

Although absolute originality is preferred by some, I doubt if most &quot;concours&quot;
judges would remove the valve cover to check the casting numbers.

The idea is to keep them running well and correctly, without causing the less
experienced among us to fret over unnecessary details.

Just my soap box and humble opinion.

Keep smiling,

Mike

&gt; &gt;Hi,
&gt; &gt;In my humble opinion, most rebuilt heads arrive ready to bolt to either side.
&gt; &gt;On the right, you don't need the sensor hole.  On the carburated engines with
&gt; &gt;Air Injection Reactor systems (Smog pump) Original heads were drilled with one
&gt; &gt;A.I.R. passage on the left head and two on the right.
&gt;
&gt; Only in model year 1974.  73 busses had two holes on both heads (total 4).
&gt; 72 of course did not have the air pump at all.  74 and 73 heads are
&gt; different in other ways as well (valve size).  All 73 heads can be used on
&gt; either side of the engine with no modifications.  74 heads were sold as
&gt; &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; by the late Mark Stephens High Performance.  Same with
&gt; GEX.  Don't know about other rebuilders.
&gt;
