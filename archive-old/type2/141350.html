Subject: RE: [T2] Fridge magnet

&gt; Just got my BusDepot order in, well half of it anyway.  They
&gt; must have gone fast.  I ordered right after Ron posted about
&gt; them!  Will my key chain eventually come in, Ron?
&gt;
&gt; The magnet is rather neat.  No VW insignia on the front, but
&gt; a really nice representation of a bay bus, roughly 2&quot; L x
&gt; 3/4&quot; W x 7/8&quot; H (50mm x 20mm x 23mm).  Hollow, too, as well
&gt; as brass of some sort.



We were short-shipped on the keychains. We have more coming around the end
of June, so all orders will be filled, albeit a little later than hoped. :-(
