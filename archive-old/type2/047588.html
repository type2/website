Subject: [T2] windshield washer change

was wondering if any one out there has swaped out there interesting wiper
system with something a little less messy!
mine leaks like a good thing and i thought that i could replace it with a
unit that had an electric pump instead of having to use a air pump
any i deas would be great!
