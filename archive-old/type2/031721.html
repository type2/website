&gt; &gt; &gt; (Tom Tarka) Again, my curiosity has been piqued:  has anyone who
&gt; &gt; &gt; experienced rear wheel bearing failure and replaced only the one
&gt; &gt; &gt; that failed, later experienced failure in the other wheel?

I didn't get the chance, I changed the other one anyway
&gt; 
&gt; I wonder if this isn't a &quot;chicken and egg&quot; problem... does the failing
&gt; bearing vibrate the nut loose or does the loose nut allow the bearing to
&gt; fail?  I am still editing pics and composing report, but once I get thru
&gt; that, I will be rebuilding the dead stub axle and will post pics.
&gt; 
&gt; One wonder I do have in rebuilding is that the inner and outer surfaces on
&gt; the hub and the castle nut are badly deformed.  I am thinking of taking
&gt; them to a machinist and seeing if they can be ground flat.  Any reason not
&gt; to?  I don't see the dimension as being critical element.

no but the temper may have been lost
