Subject: Late Bay Rear Sway Bar for sale

Hello all. I've got a Rear Sway Bar for a late Baywindow bus, complete with 
all mounting hardware, for sale. Asking 100.00 plus actual shipping cost from 
Pittsburo, NC. I've had this on my ' 79 Westy for a year or so. I've decided 
that I'm going to &quot;Baja&quot; out the camper, so for the sake of ground clearance, 
I'll sacrifice a little stability.
Thanks,
Robert
