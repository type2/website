Subject: Re: Driving in the wind

&gt;remarkable difference for me in just getting  some air in the back tires:
&gt;i had been running 30lbs front and back, changed to 30 front and 40 back and
&gt;she's much much more stable

This is a great tip, as have been all the others, but just to make things clear
to the origional poster, even with brand new ball joints, brand new tie rods, brand
new swing lever bushing/pin, brand new quality shocks, proper C load tires
adjusted front to back according to the book, brand new German steering stabilizer,
essentially just the way god intended when it left Hanover and came to you,
IT IS STILL A BUS!!!  The parents '77 has all these things, it is a Westy it still
gets tossed around in the wind.

Drive behind a semi, you will still get tossed right, left, right, left, right....
Well you get the idea.  Drive though a mountain pass where the predominant
wind is perpendicular to the pass and you can do a 2 lane, lane change before
you can correct.  Improving the &quot;antisway bars&quot; might help a little bit but they
improve body roll in corners more than the transient (would that be phugoid?)
oscillations set up on a windy day (short period actually I guess.)  Live with it or
drive a nice modern minivan with some semblance of aerodynamics.  Note that
upgrading to a Vanagon does not help, a box on wheels isn't better than a
breadloaf on wheels, the rack and pinion doesn't wear as bad but isn't that much
better inherently in my belief when loaf parts are new.

So everyone don't go tracing down a pile of nothings hoping to drastically improve
the feel of the bus, #1 tires inflated properly (even with bad tires), #2 proper tires,
if that don't help and nothing obviously is loose in front, you got what you got.
