Subject: RE: stupid ramblings an hard start

 1. I use to think it was because of longer trips that this problem
would
occur,    (since the engine would be hotter) but it happened to me stone
cold
the other day.
I got in the Bus. Turned the key and not one sound. Nothing. So I rolled
it
backwards downhill and pop started it. Drove it back up to the top,
turned it
off, tried again and it started on it's own. What is up with that?
whenever it
has done this in the past it is the same thing. And once it happens it
might
be months before it does it again.

Well no one can say fer sure but I installed a &quot;hard start relay&quot; which
I got
from Bow Wow. Some say a ford ignition relay wurkz too. I had the same
problem yesterday for the first time in 4 years (since I put the relay
in) but
I was messing around under there yesterday installing new heater
plumbing
an a in-line booster fan. I removed the old VW fan which was in the
engine
compartment and am useing the switching relay that was there to run the
new
in-line fan so it operates off the stock switching scheme. I think it
draws less
current but I can now dry my hair on the way to work. Wow! I get the
same
air flow now be it sitting at a traffic light or running down the road.
   Guess I have to check the wireing to the starter relay now,,,must
have
done something whilst I wuz mucking around under there....
