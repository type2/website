&gt;yes, it is a bit squirrely sometimes, but thats just part of driving a bus.
&gt;
&gt;what pressure are you running your tires at?  if you are running 50 psi,
&gt;then thats way too much.  higher pressure will also mean less surface contact
&gt;with the road, hence giving you the squirrley behavior you mentioned. check
&gt;the Bentley &amp; make sure you are running correct pressure.

Yes, I have the correct pressures according to both the steering column
decal and Bentley.

&gt;also, how are your other suspension components? (especially ball joints)

The front end has a number of new components including ball joints and tie
rods.  The rest has been checked out pretty carefully.  I've also recently
added swaybars front and rear.

Each step (new front end components, proper tires, swaybars) has been an
improvement, but I'm still looking for more.

&gt;you do in fact have the correct tires for your bus, so i would start looking
&gt;at other causes to the squirrely behavior.

My goal is to make highway driving a bit more relaxing.  If there is much
of a wind at all, I'll arrive at my destination with sore shoulders and
arms (even if the trip is just 2 hours).

I'm still looking for an air dam to fit the Bus which may provide a bit of
downforce to the front.  I've heard of a guy selling these in the UK, but
nothing in the US.  If all else fails, I may try to fabricate one.
