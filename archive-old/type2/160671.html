Subject: Crash site needed near Route 81Winchester Virginia

Saturday I will be driving up Route 81 from Mark Dearing's in Salem
Virginia, and visiting a source in West Virginia early Sunday morning. He
is just West of Winchester Virginia, off Route 50.

I need to 'crash' [was that a poor choice of words or what!!] somewhere
around Winchester Virginia, and off of route 50 if possible.  Any
suggestions or offers would be appreciated.

And if you have that early Bay Westy parked in the hollow right on Route
522, about 5 miles West of Route 37, across the highway from the school, the
orange one with the flowers painted on it, please pop up and stop lurking
and say hello.

Barry
