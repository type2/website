Subject: Rebuild fun

After all the prep, I get to step one (in Wilson): measure for the 
spacer at the end of the distributor drive. I need to make up about 
.076 inches. I figure that what I really need is a 3 mm 
washer/spacer/shim (and throw my old worn one in the old parts jar).

This is a dealer part. But dealers' parts counters tend not to have 
them in stock. And there's no listing for thickness. Maybe they're 2 
mm, maybe 3 mm. I ordered three of them, so that I'm covered in the 
very worst case. If they are 2 mm, I'm in a bit of trouble. Maybe I'll 
have to grind a hundredth of an inch or so off my old one and stack it 
with the 2 mm. Insisting on meeting specs is a PITA!

Meanwhile, no one has Permatex 3H. I have Gasgacinch on hand. If anyone 
thinks it's a poor choice to seal my case, yell now. NAPA has aviation 
gasket sealer, and it's Permatex, but it's not numbered 3H.

While I was hunting for it, though, I saw a product at Pep Boys called 
&quot;Low Odor Aircraft Remover.&quot; So if I want to remove an aircraft from my 
bus without making too much of a stink, I can.
