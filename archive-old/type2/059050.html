Hey Craig...

I'm glad you had a good experience with these guys.  I live 2 houses away
from the shop (black 65 bug and a beige 71 camper) and have gone there
several times for advice and parts.  They were generally helpful.
However, my wife has taken the bug there since the early 90's and had
several sketchy experiences.  Lots of money spent and questionable repairs
made.  When I started working on the bug fulltime (no more mechanics:) in
early 97, I found the engine compartment full of little interesting
surprises that I believe to be attributable to their workmanship.  No
clamps on replaced fuel lines, etc....

I wouldn't suggest not going to them again, especially after a good
experience.  However, I would check their work carefully every time you
take in in.

In the event that I have to take either car into a mechanic (god forbid:)
I will go to Carl's VW at 103rd and Meridian N or over to Wolfsburg in
Ballard.  I wouldn't take it up the street, based on my past experiences.  

Good luck...

Tom
