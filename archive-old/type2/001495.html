Subject: rear engine mounts
Date: Wed, 1 Nov 2000 08:29:10 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

hey does anyone out there know how to change out the rear rubber mounts on a
transporter, '77 model preferably. I'm referring to the mounts that the rear
engine support bar bolts to. Mine have torn loose from the block and I'm
curious as to how to replace them or resecure them....anyone had this
problem? and how expensive are the mounts?
