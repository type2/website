It is unsafe to drive without the booster hose connected. The bus
will be too hard to stop without the assist.  I have dual webers. 
Each of the short manifolds has a tap. The lines from the taps are
connected to a y-fitting with the remaining y-opening connected to
the booster via the booster hose.

&gt;Hi Everybody,
&gt;Right niw I am in the process of getting my 71 westy going(needed
&gt;engine) and i was planning on using the dual weber DCNF's that i 
&gt;have. 
&gt;Is there any way to hook up the booster to this/these carbs? is it
&gt;necessary or can the car be driven without the extra help of the
&gt;booster? thanks for any reply
