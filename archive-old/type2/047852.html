You can use a stepped stud.  8MM on one end, 10 mm on the other.

Popping in the exhaust.

&gt;     How about timing advice?

In the type 1s, 009s are usually set to 10 degrees advance static timing.  In
any street vehicle, I'd suggest the stock single diaphram vacuum / mechanical
advance distributor set at 7.5 degrees advance at idle.
