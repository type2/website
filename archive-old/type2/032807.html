Threaded valve seats were mentioned. At the &quot;toss&quot; a guy had a booth with a
demo head (140) that he had perfected a method of making and installing
threaded seats. He had made his own tap and installing tool. He cut the
thread on the outside of the seat on the lathe. He would then screw in the
seat using a hi-temp locktite. He would drill down through the thread and
press in a 1/8&quot; pin to keep it from unscrewing. Then he would peen parent
head material over the pin to keep it from coming out. It was a machine shop
type job as opposed to a bench job.
