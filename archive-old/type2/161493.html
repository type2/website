Subject: bike rack

Now that the van is running well and camping season is among us I am
looking for a bike rack.  I am thinking about one that mounts on the
front spare tire.  Basic logic being I could open the tailgate without a
lot of hassle and there is already enough weight in the back so this
would help with balancing the load a bit.  I will only be caring two
mountain bikes.  Has anyone already tried this and wish they had stuck
with a rear or visa-versa.

Also - I finally changed my fuel lines after much hesitation thinking it
would be more a PITA then it was.  I changed them on the street (busy
neighborhood in Seattle) after running most of the gas out so it would
fit in my 2 gal can.  It was easier then I imagined and didn't take too
long at all.  I did have a neighbor watching for anybody walking down
the sidewalk smoking and a fire extinguisher handy.  So if you haven't
done it because you think it will be troublesome, it is not at all.  $30
now can save the other $1000's later plus it just one less thing I have
to worry about causing problems later.
