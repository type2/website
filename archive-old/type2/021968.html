Hi Volks,

As Ken and others have now threatened me, I give up.  The bullies have won.

I still think this is foolish, and thet distribution permission could be
gained by each person, but the battle is lost.  Somone else can take up this
mess and move forward if they so choose.  I give up, I no longer have the
time nor energy to take on Ken Hooper and others against this idea.

I agree to the following relating to the Type2_dot_com archives:

   -- I will NEVER distribute a CD-ROM of the archives as a whole.
Regardless if there is permission or not.  I want this to be a plain and
simple &quot;never&quot;.
   -- I will NEVER distribute a ZIP file of the archives as a whole.
Regardless if there is permission or not.  I want this to be a plain and
simple &quot;never&quot;.
   -- I will NEVER again host a web-searchable interface of the Type2_dot_com
archives.

This is to protect myself from these legal threats.  I don't have the time
or energy to go any further on this issue.  I am cutting my losses.  I will
also be updating my http://vw.i405_dot_com/ (the former archives site) root page
to reflect this same message in the next day or two.


Parting Message
==================
If I am still welcome, I intend to just be a &quot;nobody user&quot; and post no
further messages to the list regarding admin comments, obervations,
archives, or other topics not directly relating to busses, finding busses,
fixing busses, bus shows, bus sellers, and other bus topics.  In simple
terms, I itend to make no more lists posts about the OPERATION of the lists.


Something you should know
==============================
As for why I even started this whole issue... I think some of you either do
not know or forget that I was &quot;one of the admins&quot; and the appointed person
to maintain the archives.  That responsibility included dealing with recent
trends in technology &quot;issues&quot; and new forms of distribution (anyone heard of
Napster?).  I WAS AN APPOINTED and OFFICIAL rep of this group, about as
official as you can be.  Ken Hooper himself appointed me in 6/1998 timeframe
when he requested me to host the archives at _my expense_.  Ken has NEVER
paid me.

Second, as long as you guys are run by a dictator, the only way to get rid
of that dictator is to overthrow him.  I tried that, but I lost.  Ken
outlasted me... pure and simple, I challenged his decision and lost.  I'm am
a smoldering pile of wreck, I've lost many friends in the last days, and I'm
sure my name will go down in list history for my terrible disruptions to the
list.  I'm sorry for that.  I thought I was doing my job.

 *****

Now that I'm completely ruined on the idea of being involved with group
admin or trying to improve it (in any way), I want people to know one more
fact that has not been put on the table.  You guys deal with it (or likely
ignore it).  Since so many people question MY motives, ignoring my mention
of wanting to do CD-ROM distribution for _free_ for the purposes of
_sharing_... I think you should look into Ken's motives for why he might
want someone NOT to share the archives.

We all know of Bob Hoover, right?  I would say a simple way of saying this
is that he started this whole _dont' share_ issue for THIS LIST.  Maybe it
was someone else, I'm not sure.  Not that the issue is not unique to lists
in general, but type2_dot_com (and vanagon_dot_com) list sure has a lot of baggage
that other lists do not seem to have.  Well, today I remembered once getting
a VERY interesting offer from Ken Hooper.  This is what Ken Hooper wrote to
me , shortly after he had me appointed as the archive person for Type2_dot_com.
Ken and Bob Hoover agreed to 1) remove Bob's posts from the type2_dot_com web
site, 2) Ken Hooper would make PROFIT mastering the CD-ROMs, 3) Bus Depot
would sell those CD-ROMs for profit.  In fact, the reason I know this is
because Ken contacted me, as he solicited me to help him and get in on the
profit. I told him that I was willing to help with the technical matter of
burning the CD-ROM, but I thought my involvement in such a &quot;profit venture&quot;
was not a good idea.  Do you know what Ken Hooper's 9/8/1998 email reply to
me was?
   ::::::  &quot;No way. I'm making money on this, so is Bob, if you don't add a
markup I won't let you do it.&quot; :::::

I never accepted his offer, as I would not do it for profit.  But shortly
after that, CD-ROM's did go for sale at Bus Depot.  And now, in March of
2001, Ken takes the archives away from me for merely suggesting it.  In
Ken's own words, I was 'fired' yesterday because: &quot;Stephen floated the idea
of distributing the full archive on CD-ROM or other media.&quot;

 *****

That is it.  I'm done with these issues.  Only private replies on the topics
of list admin or archives from this point forward.  For ever and ever, amen.
If you guys want archive solutions, I'm damaged goods, go elsewhere.  I am
no longer an admin, want-to-be-admin, period. I hope you can welcome back as
just a &quot;noprivledged nobody user&quot; of the list.
