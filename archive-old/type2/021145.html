Subject: Re understanding wife--
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

Because Both of us are hooked on VWs  Our home is Filled with VW stuff and so is the
garage--
There are times when Both husband and wife are into VWs--the home and garage are never
enough!

I really have to put in a plug for Magoo when it comes to VW wives--We have been doing
Pomona for some 22+ years and she has been right there with me--Through snow, cold, rain
over your ankles, in Phoenix in 100+ degree heat--she never missed a VW show in 21+
years--every Classic--Bug-In--
Drag Day--OCTO--Buses By the Bridge--Jerome--Every Bug a Rama in Phoenix--and all the 60+
shows i did in Phoenix--Now she is doing all the sales on E-Bay--We added to our garage to

house two more VWs and Magoo fought for the varience with the city!--No with my hip
replacement, she becomes my nurse--It is indeed a gift to anyone who has their wife by
there side--I really do not think there is anyone who knows much more about VW
Collectibles then Magoo--Lucky for me--I married the Best Lady i ever went out with--and
getting married at 40 years of age i had a lot of chances to make a Big Mistake---I never
had to ask her for anything--She was always there--I love you Magoo---Without Magoo--there

would be no uj--
