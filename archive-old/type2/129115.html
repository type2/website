Subject: Purchasing bus internationally

Greetings volks,
      I'm looking at purchasing a bus from South Africa. So far, the 
seller looks legit (I've gotten a lot of warnings about SA scams). I've 
got a question for those of you who have purchased a bus and had it 
imported into the states. I asked the seller if he was willing to use an 
escrow service. He said he prefers using an &quot;International Letter of 
Credit&quot; and that this would give me sufficient protections against 
damage or fraud.
      Can anybody explain to me what this means exactly? Anybody done this?
      Second--I've been quoted $4,000 US for shipping from South Africa 
to the east coast of the United States. This seems high. Has anybody 
ever shipped a bus from South Africa, and if so how and how much? I 
noticed that shipping a bus to the UK from South Africa is only around 
$1,000 US, and from the UK to the states is around $1,500. It seems like 
I could save some money by making that multiple hop shipment--but I 
don't know if this is legal or possible.
      Can anybody recommend some companies to use for shipping?

Thanks again for all of your time and wisdom,
John Tracy
