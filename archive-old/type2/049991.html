Subject: [T2] 1970 SPORTSMOBILE* PENTHOUSE EDITION

Santa stopped by today, but he was driving a big flat bed tow truck with a
cool looking 70 Sportsmobile *penthouse edition* riding high in the back.
This one's going to be fun!  I plan to have it mechanically restored by
March, or April.

Wishing you all, A Very Happy New Year!!
