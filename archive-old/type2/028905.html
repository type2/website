Late 79's came with the coveted retractable seat belts. 219 2153 965 and up.
Happy hunting, I'll check our yard for a late one. Does a junked one count.
I wanted to list all of our yard buses in my signature after our name but I
didn't think that they should count.

Well, it's Friday and you early Bay folks have been chatting about how early
your Buses are.  How about late Buses?  Does anybody out there have one of
the LAST Bays?
