Subject: Broken Valve Spring

Well, got around to doing a compression test on Wunder today - Between
115 - 130 all around.  Whew!  Guess those pieces of rings/piston land
WERE leftover from the '93 rebuild.  I'm very relieved!

Thought it would be a good idea to check the lifters, and lo - broken
valve spring.

My new mechanic pal sez he thinks the thing to do is to fill the
cylinder with compressed air to hold the valve in place so's it don't
fall into the cylinder.  Anyone done this?  How much pressure would you
need to make sure that valve didn't go anywhere?  

He figgers we can rig up a compression gauge with a t for the
compressor.  

Crazy?  How to fix replace a valve spring without pulling the engine, or
can you?

Thanks!

Teri
