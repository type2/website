Subject: re fuel sender
Content-Disposition: inline



My fuel sender is shot.  I don't know when I will be dropping the engine
next, but I do know I am not the only one who drives this vehicle.  My wife
(who is expecting) drives this on occasion.  Sometimes I don't know if she
is going 5, 10  or 50 miles when she leaves to go shopping, visit parents,
friends, etc...  I would really like to reduce the chances of her getting
stuck, especially with winter here.  Could someone please send me the
procedure for cutting the hole and replacing the sender.  78 Westy...

Oh and please save your flames, I appreciate your concern but am really not
interested.  I have higher priorities than preserving the original cosmetic
integrity of this vehicle. Sometimes function does come before form.

Thanks in advance
Graham
