Subject: Re: [T2] Ref:Bus Material

I don't think VW has hassled them yet, as I accompanied Amy to JoAnn's
Friday, and she showed me the same material. Amy has made me a snuggle-up

&gt;&gt; I found some at Wally World (Wal-Mart) last year that had buses, bugs, peace
&gt;&gt; signs, the word &quot;Love&quot;, etc. on it. We made some pillow cases out of it. Good
&gt;&gt; Luck 
&gt; 
&gt; I wonder if VW has come down on Wally world or JoAnn fabrics like they
&gt; come down on little VW shops selling a few mugs or something
