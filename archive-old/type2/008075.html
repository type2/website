Subject: Re: Upstate NY Bus mechanic?

&gt; From: TRAVIS KIVIRANNA 
&gt; I was wondering if anyone knew of or could recommend a good 
&gt; Bus/VW mechanic in upstate NY.

For busses in particular try Dan's VW in Walworth, 20 miles
east of Rochester.

For later VW's check out Select transportation in Waterloo,
Rte 5&amp;20 about halfway to Geneva. He also has a bunch of
later VW's for sale including a '96 TDI Passat that I 
droo^H^H^H^H checked out last time I was there. Website
with directions at www.selecttr_dot_com I think. If that doesn't
work try the link on my WWW page.

/Martin

PS How many bus owners are there at RIT? When I was at U of Roch
we were three.
