Subject: Type4 vs Type1 (longish)

&gt; Hmmm... I would be hesitant to claim that any T1, T2, or T3 type II will

&gt; 

PURE OPNION AHEAD! NOT OFFERED AS UNDISPUTED FACT!

I know dave's reference to T4 means the eurovan, but it made me think...about
the type1 vs. type4 debate.  Delete now if you're tired of this topic.

I have pondered this subject and it has been a repeatedly heated topic of
discussion between myself and my local fellow v-dubbers who believe (some
vehemently) the 1600 DP is the end-all-be-all of ACVW production.

Their opinions are based mainly on  a few points:

1. Everything is more expensive for a type4 engine.

2. Type4s drop valve seats more often than type1.

3. We don't understand them: &quot;That ain't even a VW to me...&quot;.

These are what i see as improvements the type4 offers over type1 engine:

1. Aluminum case (non-flammable in most situations)

2. Better design of case
   A. Bigger, Better Oil passages? (i could be wrong here, but it feels
right)
   B. All are dual relief
   C. Larger head studs
   D. Case savers standard
   E. Larger sump volume
   F. Fuel pump on opposite end of engine than distributor (on type1 they
      are side by side?  Marshmallows, anyone?)
   G. Oil cooler larger and placed so as to not burn up #3 cylinder.
   H. Higher capacity, better overall design of oil pump.
   I. &quot;bulletproof&quot; bottom end - better bearings, journals, crank and rods.
   J. Other stuff i don't know about... ;0

3. Larger displacement values, more horsepower.

4. Sodium filled valves standard on some - namely my 74.

5. Simplified valvetrain - lifters and rocker assembly.

6. Hydraulic lifters stock, easily retro-fitted.

7. NO GLAND NUT!!!

8. Endplay/line boring almost a non-issue.

9. Simplified distributor drive shaft - one shim/washer.

10. Screw-on oil filter

11. One-fastener removal of drainplate/screen/flack helmet

12. Presence of alternator

13. Design/placement of cooling fan (thrown fanbelt does not = dead engine)

14. No little oil splasher/sand guard to leave out/install backwards and cause
oil leaks.

15. Removable oil pickup tube.


Thats about all i can think of that i've come across.  A few disadvantages to
the type4:

1. Local bug shop will treat it like a beetle engine (009,plugged vac lines, 
etc) when tuning.

2. It weighs about 300lbs more than a type1

3. Parts are definitely more expensive (but you need them less often)

...and last but certainly not least...
4. Reputation for dropping valve seats.

Personally, i think *stock VW* heads on a well maintained, properly tuned bus
engine with all of its cooling tin in place and all other systems working
tip-top should last as long as a type1 head on an engine with the same
displacement/cr pushing the same amount of weight.  I mean really, why
wouldn't it? Are they really that bad of a head? Here's an idea: Somebody cut
a set of DPs to fit a type4.  Think it's possible?  Hmmmmm.

I think the type4 is more sensitive to the way all of the engine-related
systems work together than the type1 engine. If it runs hot at all for any
reason, you're asking for it  -while a beetle will take a little overheating
before laying down - maybe... almost pure speculation there - lack of
empirical evidence to support... not rocket science here...obviously...

The Story feels like it might have gone a little sumthin like this:

  When the american automobile consumer, who was able to hop in a beetle and
run it 100,000 unmaintained miles to its death (&quot;hell- that was pretty good
little car for the money!&quot;) was handed the type4 bus, he expected it to be
able to take his abuse.  First thing to happen?  Not counting poor following
of maintenance schedule or abuse of engine -Engine seal deteriorates, engine
compartment loses pressure, engine overheats.   ...down hill from there.

American auto consumer fails to notice engine seal during maintenance (?),
continues to push the bus harder until it overheats and drops a seat/valve.
Big ol' well-meaning American decides bus is junk and buys a winnebago.

Moral of story: lots of junked type4 busses waiting for TLC from those more
sensitive to what a type4 needs- like us!

Anyway, i know this is old news, not so well thought-out and poorly delivered
with a dash of negativity, but sometimes i talk to hear my head rattle- i
apologize in advance if anyone was annoyed and thanks fpor listening.
