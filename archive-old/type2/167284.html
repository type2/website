Subject: A moment of silence, please

As my 68 single cab parts truck is hauled away to the crushers. And another
classic VW gets melted down to be recycled into forks and dildo motors. She
gave her all, she did  - all the trim, engine and tranny and interior, not
to mention 40 years of service, which is damned good. I doubt too many 2007
Dodges will be around at the midpoint of the century (we'll all have
jetpacks by then, really).

But she had to be scrapped. I was fighting with a seatbelt bolt this
morning, so I grabbed the belt and leaned on it. The belt pulled off along
with a chunk of rusted sheet metal :)
