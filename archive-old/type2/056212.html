We use the icebox in our '76 standard Westy, pile all the loose clothing
and blankets we have on board on top and on the side of it, works GREAT!
ie, come back from 3 day trips with ice still solid. We also save any
&quot;Omaha Steaks&quot; styrofoam boxes we come across, they're made of dense foam
and work very well. We have a Coleman which is a handy table but not much
good for keeping stuff cold...

For $125 you can buy a *lot* of ice...


&gt;I've seen a lot of questions on the list about refrigerators ( installing,
&gt;repairing,etc.) What I use in mine (non-deluxe) is an Igloo refrigerator
&gt;that runs on both AC/DC. I plug it in to AC the night before,so it gets
&gt;cold, then load it with drinks, food,( helps if they are already cold too)
&gt;take it out to the camper and plug it into the cigarette lighter. When you
&gt;get to a campground, you can switch it back to AC. If found it works
&gt;great, but obviously would'nt do if you're camping where there are no AC
&gt;hookups. Cost about $125.00   Jeff
