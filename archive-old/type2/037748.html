Subject: Heat exchangers

Come to think of it....

Does anybody know if I can remove my heat exchangers and how/what type of exhaust system I could use? would I have to have it made special?
I used to drive my bus in the winter  but now it comes out in the Spring...I have had it trying to beat the TONS OF ROAD SALT they use in my State

Peace
