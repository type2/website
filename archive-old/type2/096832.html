Subject: Hydraulic lifters (I'm all ears)

Hello Volks,

	I'm in the process of adjusting the lifters on my 2.0L also. I&quot;m
keeping it simple and just Boston's directions. The only thing I can't
figure out is which one is tapping. I even took the rocker cover off and
looked and listened, while dodging spittles off oil. It sure was cool to
see them babies working.

	So according to Bob I ran her a couple for a couple weeks, started
for 30 seconds and listened and I couldn't tell exactly where the noise was
coming from. Do I need a stethscope? Any suggestions?

				Thanks, Craig
