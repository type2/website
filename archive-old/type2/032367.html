Subject: Parts trade, 64 engine is Hamburger

Well, you all may remember I posted last week about a seized engine in a 64.  I tore it down this weekend and I have never witnessed such a mangled ugly mess of twisted metal inside the case.  It had a shattered piston, busted up connecting rod, chunked crankshaft, and a cracked case.  I don't know which one came first, but whichever it was, I'm sure all the others were soon to follow.  Anyway, This is a perfect opportunity for me to experience my first engine rebuild.  Does anyone have these good used parts: 1500 engine case, crankshaft, pistons, and cylinders.  I don't have much money to spend on this but I do have alot to trade including: A bunch of bay window glass, 2 bay window front doors (clean and straight), a bay window back hatch (clean and straight), many camper interior cabinets from splits and bays, complete set of curtain rods for a split camper and one for a bay window camper, a NICE brown Vanagon rear bench seat, and a VW Special edition Trek Mountain Bike in e!
!
xcellent shape! Anyone want to do some bartering?
