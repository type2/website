I was out at Crazy Ray's here in Baltimore City yesterday and saw a few
items that jogged memories of recent mentions on the list.  For any
interested, I saw:

'78 passenger bus with a pair of those nice late bus sliding side
windows and niceish front door trim panels, transmission, etc.

'77 passenger bus with a BA6 still tucked underneath.

Air-Cooled vanagon with drive train still there.

Bus-usable 1600 dual port fuel injection and alternator on a late bug.

For those not within striking distance, I'd be willing to retrieve and
ship items if compensated.  I have the price list for any interested.
