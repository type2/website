Subject: Mendocino Update - Rescued Bus back in Sacramento

Hi Bus Folks:

Spent yesterday driving 4 hours out and 9 hours back with my friend's 
78 Westy on a dolly.  It's back in his driveway in Davis and we will 
need to look at what happened.

The flywheel (or is it fan wheel) is in a box in the back.  I looked 
at the keyway on the wheel, it's only minor-ly messed up -- same with 
the crankshaft.  My thought is we saved my friend, Carl about $1750 
in repairs which wouldn't have done the trick.  Wit the wheel off 
(and the muffler (vroom vroom) the bus fired right up and we drove it 
easily onto the tow dolly.

I get back from my own vacation on the 15th of September and will 
likely be looking at this further and will be looking for help from a 
Davis/Sacto list member then.  In the meanwhile my friend is reading 
Muir and Bentley and learning about his van while he can't drive it 
for a bit (he has another car).

Again, the careful and thoughtful help from the list members made all 
the difference and saved the day.

I'll be posting pictures of the wheel and shaft ASAP to see what you all think.

New Bus owners, learn from this!  If you buy a bus which has been 
sitting and you get it running and painted, don't forget the engine! 
If you are not a mechanic (or worse academics like us) get a 
competent VW mechanic to go over then engine before the thousand mile 
camping trip!  This ended well, but it could have been a lot worse!

BEN
