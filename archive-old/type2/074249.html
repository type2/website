Subject: floor care and replacement

You might want to look into truck bed liner material.
The spray on or brush on kind. Kill any rust, paint it
and then apply the flex type truck bed stuff that
adheres to the surface. Works well in truck beds and
they get alot more abuse than your bus floor would (in
most cases). You can also have it done but you would
need to strip the interior and mask off the edges and
the seat attach brackets. The do-it-yourself stuff you
could probably do without all the prep work. Use a fan
for keeping the fume level down while applying the
stuff (unlees of course you are into that kind of
thing). You can make it as thick as you want it to be.
