Subject: 12 Volt Converter and more

See the type2 page.

http://www.type2_dot_com/buysell/carview.php?view=34

It is little easier than mailing individually with enclosures!

I will give preference to who wants all three pieces.  Only the 12 Volt 
converter was priced at $20, then I saw the Control Panel!!!

Just what you need for the cold months, and weak batteries.

Thanks
