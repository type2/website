Subject: [T2] Mexican/Brazilian Bumpers?

		Hey all,
		  I know this has come up before, but I have not seen
anything else about it. Is it possible to get those Brazilian blade bumpers
imported to the US? I like the look of them and would like to add them to
whatever Bus I get. I know we have talked about it, but has anyone imported
them yet? Ron, is this a possibility? Was there some kind of price problem?
I would really like to get a set.(at least front)
