Subject: Re: [T2] SOS

hey Guys   Doc ric does this every year. I didn't buy it for a  second as I 
knew he was doing this job at Boyds today.  I can't believe you  guys got 
suckered by that.  Now on the other hand I did have a single cab  seat down on the 
toes of my shoe one time as I was changing a tire . I had to  remove my shoes 
to get out from under it. It was agood thing I noticed it  dropping and curled 
my toes real quick.  later  Mark  Dearing
