Subject: Bus visit;

Fellow listees;
   St. Louis based listee Larry Collett paid a visit yesterday morning
on his way to the Big Bend area of Texas and ultimately to the VW
shindig out in Tucson later this month.
   We had a nice visit over coffee, swapped some bus tales and admired
each others Bus. Larry's Bus (Clyde) is a '76 (2.0L F.I.), nice blue and
white combo. It's not a Westy, but he appeared to have the bases covered
as far as bus camping goes. He said he was pretty self contained with
his homemade setup. I spotted a hammock rigged up in there.
   Larry mentioned a &quot;good guys&quot; VW shop in Ardmore, Oklahoma that got
him out of a jam on the way down. It seems Clyde's starter decided it
would be a good day to die and did so. Larry was staying at his Dad's
house, with a nice long sloped driveway. He parked the bus pointing
downhill and got on the phone to locate some help. He contacted &quot;Earl
Mann's Bug Shop&quot; in Ardmore and arranged to meet them at the shop in the
morning. As Larry tells it, he was there in the morning when they
opened, Clyde having cooperated with the rolling start. Mann's grease
monkeys opened the garage door, Larry rolled in and they went to work.
10 minutes later, used starter installed, they were done. The charge?
$60.00. Excellent!
   After we visited a while Larry was ready to press on to the day's
destination of
Seminole Canyon, about an hour west of Del Rio.
   If you spot a blue &amp; white '76 along the road in West Texas/New
Mexico, give him a wave. Pleasant fellow and that bus engine was purring
like a kitten when he pulled out of my driveway.

'78 Westy (under reconstruction, and after seeing Larry's I really want
to hit the road in this puppy...work harder, work harder!)
