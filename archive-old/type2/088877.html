Subject: Re: [T2] Rear Tail Light Assemblies (+ a thanks...)


&gt; Last week, I won an 'auction' for some new tail light assemblies
&gt; for my '78 from a gent in Sao Paulo, Brazil.  (Apparently someone
&gt; with an &quot;in&quot; -- he's always sellin' &quot;new&quot; Bus stuff...)

I know this guy and have bought several items from him direct, they are
always good quality for Brazilian parts.

&gt; They arrived today, and it took me, yes - FIVE hours to complete
&gt; the task.  But I digress.  The point of this post is to pass
&gt; along some observations:

&gt; 1- The tail lights that I purchased, some &quot;special dark lens
&gt; assemblies&quot; are pretty neat in that the lens is charcoal grey
&gt; throughout - it's the little &quot;cups&quot; that cover the lenses that
&gt; give them the correct red/yellow/clear appearance when energized.
&gt; Now, I don't know if that's all legal here in Jawjah (Georgia),
&gt; but they are nice to look at.
&gt; 2- The little &quot;cups&quot; that I referred to are pieces of crap.  I
&gt; broke two of four while installing.  Beware.

I Installed the same exact tail light assemblies on my 72 and had no
problems. They went right in in 10 minutes.

&gt; 3- The general quality of these VW-Brazil assemblies did not
&gt; exactly overwhelm me.  They are cheap in price and manufacture.
&gt; But, for 25 bucks, I thought I'd give them a try...

As did I, but I was not expecting Hella quality assemblies, these of coarse
are from Brazil. But I was impressed at how easily they went in.


This guy is also working on getting window seals for 412's. Since the molds
were lost for the 412 window seals the next closest car is the Brasillia (A
car manufactured in Brazil and sold to the South American and Central
American Markets only, but VERY similar to the 412)
