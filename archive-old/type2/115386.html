Subject: Re: [T2] Slip Streaming a Semi on I-95

OK, thanks, I got it...

Since my VW is about 15 ft (177 inches) long, I should have 1.5 - 2 Westy 
car length spaces from the front of my Westy to the rear of the trailer.


BTW, I noticed the sign on some of the trailers that say &quot;If you can't see 
my mirrors, I can't see you!!&quot;, so do you think I should honk my horn every 
few minutes so the driver knows I am back there??

And the trailer MAY be able to stop in a shorter space than my Westy, but 
then again, I did just put new shoes on the rear wheels..


Barry thanks all.

PS.  Since 90% of the accidents occur within 3 miles of your home, I will 
patiently wait until I get outside that radius.  No use tempting . . .

&gt; &gt; However, I did not notice any improvement in drafting the 18 wheeler (if
&gt; &gt; that was a 'semi', I would hate to see a full grown one...).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; How far back, or close up to the 18 wheeler should I have been,  both 
&gt;going
&gt; &gt; at 60 MPH, to notice the draft??
&gt;
&gt;your nuts, but for what its' worth at about a 1/2 the truck length back
&gt;(25-30ft) it's almost a free ride, I have gotten over 40mpg doing that,
&gt;but the concentration and intensity is insane and as crazy as it sounds
&gt;those big rigs can stop faster than a bus if the brakes are in good
&gt;condition.
