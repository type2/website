&gt; Hoover's Sermon on engine break-in doesn't mention when (or if) you should
&gt; change the oil filter during the process. I'm getting to run my new engine,
&gt; complete with a full-flow, for the first time. Any suggestions?
 
IMHO you should change the filter at the same time you change the oil 
the first time.  I like to cut the filter open and inspect for metal 
but you need a filter cutter and can make one with parts from an old 
pipe cutter.  Do not use a hack saw for obvious contamination 
reasons.  I also like to take a sample of the oil when I drain it.  
Let the first 4 to 8 ounces drain into a quart mason jar and dilute 
it with gas.  Stir it real good and let it settle a bit.  Carefully 
pour off most of the dirty gas and dilute again.  You will eventuall 
see if anything is lurking in the oil.  Use a magnet on the outside 
of the glass to see if the particles are iron from rings, cylinder 
walls and other normal wear stuff or non-ferous  from bearings or 
case etc.  You are going to see a certain amount of that in the 
filter and in the oil sample but it should be greatly reduced or even 
not detectable in subsequent oil changes.
