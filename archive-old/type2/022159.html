&gt;I have the stock shifter in my '77 Bus and want to

&gt;I am just wondering if this will mean that it will shift
&gt;in the standard &quot;H&quot; pattern? 
&gt;Any ideas?

Courtney,
The shifter will not change the h pattern, other than possibly making it
tighter. You certainly won't need to change transmissions!  The new shifter
simply bolts in place of the stock one.  Be sure to have a shop manual
available to refer to when doing the R&amp;R and making the adjustments
required after.

Good luck,
Pat
