Subject: New listee

I am now the new proud owner of a 72 type 2 which has replaced our 90 Subaru
Legacy as the family wheels.  (The Legacy has some serious and expensive
problems)  I am very new to this whole VW thing and have found that our bus
adventure could be a rather interesting one.  I actually bought the bus a
couple of years ago for just under $500.  It had a liquid cooled buick V-6
(it didn't run) in it and a radiator hanging off the back.  After we ran
into our problems with our Subaru we found that it would be more within our
budget to throw an engine in the bus.  We now have a 79 2000 c.c. motor
pushing it.  I am rather interested in finding out more info on what the
original identity of this bus was all about.  (through the vin #)  Also I am
hoping to be able to put the interior back in somewhat of a reasonable
order.  I was hoping for some suggestions on where I could come up with some
catalogs that I could find some interior panels and etc.  I also have
another question, do all VW's smell like a gas chamber or do I have some
sort of a problem?

Thanks

Randy in Seattle
