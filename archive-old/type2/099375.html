Subject: Holley Bugspray for sale or trade

Hi All!  
I have a Holley Bugspray and Manifold for sale or trade for a good set of 
manifolds for dual Solex Carbs.  I'm asking $75 obo, but am really looking 
for manifolds for running duals on my 1600.  I've really liked the feedback 
on the dual Solex's, and have a friend who is keeping me updated on how that 
has worked out.  I can be reached at www.bmrowland_at_hotmail_dot_com
Thanks,
Barry
