&quot;Yes it (71) uses a one-year-only BUS upper front apron.&quot;

Well, that's good to know. So begins the ever so exciting partsearch
process...

The original message spoke of a beetle case being drilled and tapped for the
rear bar. I have heard that this is risky since the bus case is meatier than
the beetle case where the bosses are - if there are bosses at all on the
beetle case. 
Is this true or can i get excited about running a late model beetle case?
I have heard the alloy mix changed and the later model cases are tougher - is
this true?
I apologize for not having first-hand experience here, i've been ankle-deep in
type4 stuff for a few years but have no type1 background - yet.

thanks Karl, et al

71, 74, 75, 78 busses.




&gt; Here's where it gets confusing:
&gt; The case has been drilled and correctly tapped for the
&gt; rear bus crossmember - fits, I checked. Bolts right up
&gt; to the bus. However, I'm at a loss as to shrouding. I
&gt; know some of it is the same, but I appear to be
&gt; missing a couple of pieces, including the one that
&gt; attaches to the front of the doghouse and seals to the
&gt; firewall.
