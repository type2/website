Subject: Rear bumper/bug muffler...

First time posting, thanks in advance.

'71 Westy have rear bumper and brakets, bug muffler.  Do i have to get a bus 
muffler to get bumper on? What about special exaust pipes to clear the 
bumper?  Don't have any hardware, what size bolts do I need?

Thanks,
Daniel
