Subject: Clutch and Brake Pedal Seals?

I just received my new seals for my pedals and can't for the life of me figure
out how to put them on without splitting them. How's it suppose to be done?
Just a follow up on balancing. I have a new aluminum type1 case for my next
rebuild. I had RIMCO inspect it for flaws and machine it for my purposes. Is
there any one on the list running an aluminum case succesfully?
Tim
