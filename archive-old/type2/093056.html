&gt; &gt; All the low mileage vehicles I've had (properly cared for of course) had

&gt; &gt; The trick with old vehicles is to find one with GENUINE low miles AND the

&gt;This seems totally obvious, I'm sorry to say.

Funny, I would have argued the exact opposite.  :)  There was a guy in the 
paper the other day with a '92 accord with over a million miles on it, and 
it still drove &quot;like a new car&quot;.  Personally, from a reliability standpoint 
I will take a newer, high-mileage vehicle any day over an older, 
low-mileage one.

&gt;IMHO, for the average owner it's better not to inherit the original brakes,
&gt;rotors, cv boots, gas tank, fuel lines, paint, etc.

Suddenly, I agree with you.  :)  But with our busses, it's really not 
important as you either get an old bus with low miles, or an old bus with 
high miles.  And in this case, the old bus with low miles is of course 
preferable.
