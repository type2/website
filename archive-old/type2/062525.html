Subject: compressed air in a can

&gt;After you soak the carb, you're supposed to blow out all the passages with
compressed air. Problem is, &gt;you guessed it, I have no air compressor.
Does anyone sell cans of compressed air?
 
Bob--
Cans of compressed air (actually compressed 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane) are
readily available to clean computers out with.  The stuff is advertised as
containing no ozone depleting CFCs, and being non-flamable.  The brand name
of the stuff I use (for the pathetically brand-conscious) is &quot;PerfectData&quot;
and costs somewhere in the neighborhood of five bucks for a good size can.
Like WD-40, it's probably a good stock to buy--and for the same reason!
It's generally available wherever people with pocket protectors hang out.

On the other hand, air compressors are REALLY NEAT because they allow you to
buy all kinds of accessory tools--like sand blasters, impact wrenches,
cut-off wheels, orbital sanders, air chisels, spot blasters, spark plug
cleaners, paint sprayers, and blow nozzles.  You can also fill your tires in
the safety and privacy of your own driveway (where permitted by law).  

Good luck with your carb rebuild!!
