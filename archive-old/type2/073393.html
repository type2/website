What you should do, if I'm understanding you correctly, is to reuse your
old throttle body with the vacuum tube.  Just remove the two machine screws
holding it to the carb and swap them.  While you have the throttle body
off, check the bottom surface of the carb with a straightedge.  They tend
to warp when people tighten down the carbs excessively, which leads to poor
sealing against the throttle body.

Alternatively you can get the vacuum from the line that eventually goes to
your brake booster.  Simply tap into that line and run it to your vacuum
retard.  This might be the better option if your old throttle bodies are
worn.  If you have the stock crosspipe and elbows, one of the elbows
probably already has a small vacuum line coming from it for (I think) the
emissions equipment.  Put a tee in this line.  If you don't have this line,
you can cut out a section of the crosspipe and install some hose with a
tee.  Don't tap into the brake booster line foreward of the check valve
though (located just forward of the firewall).
