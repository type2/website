&lt;&lt;  the manual says to adjust till you feel a
 &quot;moderate&quot; drag on the gauge, which I did...could what I perceive to be
 moderate drag be  too little drag? &gt;&gt;
One way to take the guess work out of valve adjustments is to get a set of go-
no go feelers gauges.  These have the regular .006 at the end but in a little
further is a step that go's to .008.  If the gauge go's in and stops at the
step, you at least know your with in .001.  If the gauge go's past the step
you know your still to wide.  After you adjust your valves enough you'll start
to get the feel.
   Peace, Love, and make sure your adjusters and lock nuts are in good shape-
this saves time and frustration!!!
