 #2 here is the input shaft:

the bearing is # 7.  VW part number:
mid 69 to the end of 71 is 001 311 125
72 up is 001 311 125A.

 Do you know who sales them? I looked for them on BusDepot
 and cip1_dot_com, neither even showed them as a listed part??


Well, it really would help of you gave the year of your bus or transmission!

If you go to Bus Depot and just enter the part number on the left side, you will find the 1st number listed.
http://www.busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=001311125

The 2nd number does not appear.

This is one of the things I have complained to Ron about, but he does not seem to grasp the problem. His
search system works fine IF you know the part number. It SUCKS if you don't!  He calls the 1st part number a
&quot;Ndl Brg MS&quot; which translates to Needle Bearing Mainshaft. But if you do a search for Needle Bearing, you get
6 items, of which none are what you want. If you do a search for it spelled as ndl brg ms, it is the only one
that comes up. That's nice, but how in the hell do you know he spells like that?!?

To make matters worse, VW calls it  001311125 = N-brg-o-28
and it is a deleted part with no substitute available.

This VW dealer has it: DAVE WALTER INC     AKRON,OH        330-434-8989

      The later, A suffix number, comes up zero. It is NLA available from VW.
