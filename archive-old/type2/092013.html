Subject: Loving my bus

Thanks for the words of encouragement fellow listees!  For anyone who
asked the bumper sticker is from a store called Hot Topic.  I forgot to
mention that I love my bus so much, I got it tattoed on my leg.  It hurt
a lot, but it was worth it.  It only confirms my strangeness with those
I work with.  Beth
