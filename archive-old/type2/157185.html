Subject: RE: [T2] &quot;Essential&quot; on-board tool kit and parts...

I carry this stuff:

For local driving
VW Tire Change Kit
Screwdrivers
Old Cap &amp; Rotor
Points
Timing Light
Tach/Dwell meter
V/Ohm meter
Adjustable Wrench
Vise-grips
Fix-a-Flat
FIRE EXTINGUISHER
Flares
Flashlight
CV Joint tool (NOT allen wrench)
Spare CV Bolts &amp; washers
Oil
Brake Fluid
Duct Tape
Air Cooling Fluid (Just Kidding)

For Long Trips:
All of the above, plus...
Tool Box(wrenches, sockets, tap&amp;die, etc)
Portable Drill &amp; bits
Oil Filter &amp; Oil collector.
Grease/Shop Rags/Hand Cleaner/Penetrating Oil
Soldering iron/Solder/wire
All of my spare parts, including
Starter
Distributer
Wheel bearings
Spark plugs
Misc. FI parts (spare carb in your case)

I'm sure there's more stuff that might be useful on a
long trip.  If you do a nasty mountain climb in the
warmer weather, it might be a good idea to change the
oil and adjust the valves immediately afterwards. I
don't carry a spare head, because I can't drop the 2.0
by the side of the road, but I probably would if I
drove a 1.6.
