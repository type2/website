Subject: Oil Temp Gauge Mounting

------=_NextPart_000_0048_01C131F5.41A58680
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I'm trying not to overheat another engine so I have bought a VDO Oil =
Temperature Gauge for the 72 Weekender.=20

Up to this point I have been able to keep my dash original with no cuts, =
I have a Sunpro tach in the clock position now.

Has any one else wanted to avoid cutting their dash and found the =
&quot;perfect&quot; place to mount it without looking UGLY and having wires to =
exposed?

How about the mounting of the sending unit, it read to tap a hole in =
your oil drain plate, any other suggestions? If I do end up taping the =
oil plate any one have a suggestion for a block plate or something? I =
would hate to break it off, the only concern is on campout where you =
might get into a rut or something, haven't bottomed the engine out yet.

Thanks to all of you that can help and the best of bussin to the rest of =
us :-)

This time next week I hope to be on my way to Picasso Moon, a Full Moon =
Bus Club Camp Out! If you didn't make it last year I would suggest all =
the folks close should come, it is an AWESOME camping spot!


Meredith
