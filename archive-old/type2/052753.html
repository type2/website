Jon:
They are not available new, though the covers probably are from several sources.
The seat itself will have to come from a  salvage yard, or other individual who
sells parts. Location is very important when finding bulky items.
This brings something to mind: I have a friend (also named Jon) who has a 2
person center seat, black,  available from a 73 type 2. It's in his back yard, so
I can't vouch for its present condition. I could go look, though, it's only a
mile away. I imagine it would be free or nearly free. We are located in Cedar
Falls, Iowa (northeast Iowa).
