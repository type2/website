Subject: Re: [T2] quality of interior

I have to totally agree with Robert.

Comparing our 1979 Westy hard top's interior to a BRAND NEW Dutch  
Star or Winnebago Rialta is like night and day.

Our 69's interior is solid, still smells like real wood, and looks  
very classy and refined.

You just don't find that sort of craftsmanship in today's RVs and  
other vehicles of that ilk. Unless you pay top dollar ($1 million)  
for a Prevost Coach or something similar, I just don't see new  
vehicles being built to last.

Planned obsolescence? Sure seems like that is getting worse.

Even my 74 Campmobile's interior seems sort of &quot;cheap&quot; compared to  
the OEM Westy interior in our 69. If I had to do a rest over, I'd go  
with the baltic birch interior instead of the darker wood we now see.

However, the new Eurovan campers I have seen, and even the Eriba  
Puck's interiors are really gorgeous. They seem to have a higher  
design sense of style and use of fabrics and materials.

Just my opinion.
