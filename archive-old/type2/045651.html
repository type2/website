Did you clean the rubbing surfaces with a wire brush?  There are many brands
of brake lube out there (for metal to metal contact points, not the friction
surfaces, nor the retaining pins.)  High temp.  There are also good anti
squeak products out there.  Check to insure the pistons and their retaining
plates are properly positioned and installed.  Check the rubber dust seal
while you are in there.

Keep smiling,
