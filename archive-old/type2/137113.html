Subject: Re: [T2] Dumb Thermostat/Heat Flaps Question

I ran my 245,000 mi never rebuilt engine for 11 years with thermostat
not working and flaps wide open in NJ- finally fixed it after getting
onto this list somewhere around '98.
From that, I don't think it hurts the engine so much as just taking
longer to warm up your heat system in winter.

 I've run my flaps in the full open position for ten years, just locked
