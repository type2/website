&gt; &gt; This stuff is high and getting higher.  I do not know of a way to avoid or

&gt; &gt; Paint guns and computers get less expensive all the time to compensate, I

Think about it.  You expect this stuff to go on smooth and glossy and to
look perfect for 10 years in the sun without oxidizing.  That's a somewhat
higher expectation than you would have of $20/gallon house paint.
Designing a coating that will do that is not a trivial exercise, and they
don't sell nearly as much car paint as they do house paint.

Personally, I think that the manufacturers are holding us hostage by
feeding the desire for a mirror surface on sheet metal.  If cars came with
matte or semi-matte finishes they would be a lot easier to keep looking
new.  I'm thinking about adopting a &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; look on our '69 bug.
Heck, I want body panels molded out of Little Tykes plastic with
color all the way through and &quot;pop it back out&quot; bodywork capability!


&gt; Gillette usta run specials...Buy a coupla packs of blades and they gave you
&gt; the
&gt; razor free...
&gt; Printers are like that too...a coupla cartridges and you've spent the cost of
&gt; the
&gt; printer...Epson, for one that I know, puts a chip in the cartridge that tells
&gt; the
&gt; printer that it's too low on ink to print. Even if you use the refill kit,
&gt; the chip
&gt; won't let the printer print... ;-(

Yeah, that stinks.  Parts intentionally designed to make themselves
non-functional is really predatory engineering.  That's even lower than
the 90% empty cartridges that come with printers these days.

The last printer I bought is a HP Laserjet 4L.  I bought it 12 years ago,
new, for $600, but in the time I've been using it I have replaced the
cartridge once.  It is hooked to its third computer, still works
perfectly, and will probably keep working as long as I want it too.
Unfortunately, it has only a parallel interface, so compatibility will
rear its ugly head soon.  I think that it was the last decent consumer
level printer HP made.
