I had two bus sightings on Saturday.

One was a (I think) mid 70s tan over orange bay window at a gas station
on east bound rt. 50 about a mile before the Bay Bridge at around 7:45
am.  I suspect it was Steve Dolan, but I could be wrong.

The second one was a pretty nice green 21 or 23 window in a Honeycomb
ceral commercial.

Lastly, a while back someone had asked about what hand cleaner people
used.  I haven't seen the results of that poll.  Also looked in the
archives and egroups, but didn't find it in those places either.  Any
place else, or were the results just never posted?   I get a lot from
those polls, specifically two products come to mind directly as a result
of the informal polls - por-15 and kroil - both excellent products I'm
not sure I can do without anymore!
