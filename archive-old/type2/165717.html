Wonderfully simple and the best part is that it has
been working without a problem for two years! Great
solution. -BaH

 Hi Volks,
 
 When I went FI with a 1973 single-outlet tank I cut
 down a spare  
 passenger side fuel rail to make a pair of metal T
 fittings. One of  
 which is in my spares pile, the other has one end
 attached to the  
 tank, one end attached to the fuel filter, and the
 third end attached  
 to the fuel return line.
 
 It has been two years running without issue. All you
 need is a T, not  
 a tank swap.
 
 
 Happy Trails,
