Subject: I wrecked Hoss

After all the Love, Sweat, and Skin I put into getting our 72 Westy
Weekender restored I decided to pass a STOPPED Trash
Truck on the left, and before I knew it he was moving and turning left,
I hit the horn and tried to avoid him, he never looked to
see me or turn and he clips the right rear part of the bus, half way
through the wheel well, IT HURT SO MUCH, I FELT THE PAIN OF MY BABY
HOSS!!!!!!

Of course we only have Liability on the bus and I got the Ticket for
passing on the left, that one I still cant believe.


So I have learned not to pass on the left, buy collision insurance for
something you Love, and to find witnesses on the spot!


Meredith
