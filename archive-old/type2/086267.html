Subject: transmission interchange

My bus i have to double clutch third gear to shift without grinding as the
PO broke his clutch cable and tried to power shift it to the mechanics. It
still drives great but i figured if i can find another transmission i would
grab it. I need to know if they are the same for all bay window busses. I
have a 1977 transporter.
thanks,
Glenn
