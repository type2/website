Subject: [T2] New seals new draft question


&gt; I have replaced the seals in both front doors, the slider, and the pop
top.
&gt; It is now very quiet, but at highway speed I seem to have a blast of cold
air
&gt; coming from the rear of the bus.
&gt;
&gt; Is it possible all this tight sealing would cause cold air to coming in
the
&gt; rear hatch that still has the old seal? Did I create some sort of vaccum
or
&gt; vortex?
&gt;
&gt; Your thoughts would be appreciated.
