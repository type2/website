&gt;&gt;&gt;Pertronix units are great when they're working.  But they create a
whole new
category of headaches when they're not.&lt;&lt;&lt;


I just dont get this thinking and Ive seen it a number of times.
Carry a spare dizzy complete or a set of points/cond and troubleshoot by
swapping the same as you would if there was a faulty set of points or
condenser in there.
In reality its easier because it is either working or not. There is no
adjustment problem to fiddle over.
Personally my preferance would be to carry a spare dizzy with another
pertronix in it. 
The unit is warranteed for 18 months. If it fails within this period you
get it replaced. I just see it as a high failure part. Surely It doesnt
have a high a mtbf  rate as points.

As far as economics go. I calculated that a daily driven (15000mi+/yr)
bus will require approx the same outlay for points/cond as the cost of a
points repl unit over 18 months. Of course thepertonix has gone up a bit
since I last checked.
