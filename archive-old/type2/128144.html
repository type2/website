&gt; I've developed quite an oil leak on my bus ('68 Kombi 1600cc SP), and I'm

&gt; correct this is the crank case ventilation.  The tube also heads downwards, 
&gt; and ends just above the lower tin.  I'd take a picture but the warm air 
&gt; duct that runs to the air cleaner is in the way.  Anyway, this tube drips 
&gt; oil onto the tin, which naturally creates some knarly smoke.  Is this tube 
&gt; supposed to be connected back to the block somewhere?  I don't see any 
&gt; extra parts from the engine pull/installation, but I haven't looked to hard 
&gt; yet.

on mine this penetrates the tin and &quot;harmlessly&quot; allows it to exit
below. there is a &quot;birds beak&quot; kinda thing on the end as well. that
seals when there is no pressure.
