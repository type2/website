&gt; I have a '71 Bus with a sliding door problem I can't figure out.  

Your timing could not be better! :-)  We had a post on this a week or two
ago and it inspired me to go out and use some of the precious electrons
and bits that my new Olympus digital camera came supplied with :-)  The
result was (a) a post on and (b) a series of pictures on &quot;how to maintain
the rear support (RS) of the sliding door&quot;!  Since I can push buttons with
the best, but have been avoiding .html like the plague, I asked for a
volunteer on the list to html'ize the post and pics.

Jarrett Kupcinski volunteered to try to make sense of my scriblings and
just let me know that the page is done!  Timing *is* everything!  Please
go visit:

http://kpcnsk.home.sprynet_dot_com/sliddoor.html 

and let him or I know if this is what you need.  Let me know if it could
be clearer (I already see the typo's and we will correct them :).

The next step is to generate a page on rehabbing the RS itself.  I have
taken the pictures of that but have not yet written up the procedure or
passed it it Jarrett.  The pictures are at:

http://www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/rearhinge/

But there is no text yet :-( Numbered shots are the raw pics and are
rather large.  the named shots are much smaller and are the ones we will
probably use in the page.  Again, comments are welcome (also further
vict... err...volunteers :-)
