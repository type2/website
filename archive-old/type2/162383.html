&gt; Also, to the listers in VA area ... the family (wife, 3 kids) and I are
&gt; planning a Memorial day camping trip to Antietam Battlefield, and I am
&gt; looking for any good advice on camping spots, other things to do in the

well the same camp spot were using for John Browns Buses is first rate.
also you are not far from the C&amp;O canal where there are some camp sites.
state parks with camping
my favorites include
. Greenbriar state park
. Cunningham falls state park
also
. Gambrill state park

couple commercial campgrounds in the Antietam area but I am not familiar
with em, I like the state parks myself.  try Greenbriar, my kids liked it
there best.

also in the area is
. Harpers Ferry
. Sheperdstown
. the first Washington Monument
. Crystal Grottos
. the Ziem winery is near Antietam for the big kids
. the outlets in Martinsburg for the shoppers
. night racing and slots for the adult in Charlestown.
. &quot;rump bump&quot; tubing on the Shenedoah river.
. Gettysburg is not far but far far more touristy and crowded than
Antietam
. maybe one of the largest fleamarkets around on route 340 between Harpers
Ferry and Charles town. if your interested I could give you more detailed
directions, it's at an old drive in movie theater.


lots to do

Bob
