&gt; How can I isolate the bn4 circuit from the radio circuit.  I ear the

&gt; connected on the batery all the time ( circuit number 30) and each one as a
&gt; fuse on it.
&gt;
&gt; My engine as 4 sparkplugs and My radio is very good.  I dont see any special

&gt;
&gt; any suggestions?

Luc,

There are two types of noise, radiated and conducted.

Radiated noise leaves the high voltage wire and the spark plug and enters the
radio through the antenna or through the case as a result of poor shielding.

Conducted noise is riding along the power lines and hitches its ride to the
radio through the 12V line.

Radio Shack or your Friendly Local Electronics Store House (FLESH) have
inductors that are used to eliminate alternator whine and similar conducted
noises from the radio.  You could start by inserting one of these in the power
line of your radio, right at the radio.

If I remember right, the BN4 has a plastic case which covers all of the
electrical stuff attached to the top of the nuclear sausage.  A quick fix
attempt would be to try the following.

Cover the top of the plastic case with aluminum foil.  Wrap it around and cover
as much as you can and see if it makes a difference to the radio.  If that works
you might want to take some steps to cover the inside of the plastic cover with
foil and plastic as described below.

You may need to do both fixes.

Hope this helps

Scott

------------------

Materials:
Aluminum Foil
Plastic wrap
contact cement
sand paper
cleaning fluids

1. Before removing the cover, scribe the perimeter of the cover onto the outside
surface of the heater.
2. Remove the plastic cover &amp; clean the inside and outside of the cover.
3. Tear off a sheet of foil that will be big enough to cover the inside of the
cover and hang out the edges.
4. Fit the foil inside and trim about 1/2 inch outside of the cover.
5. put enough contact cement inside along the top and sides of the cover to hold
the foil, put contact cement in corresponding locations on the foil.
6. Wait a few minutes for the cement to set &amp; push the foil into the cover.
7. Repeat steps 3-6 with the plastic wrap but this time cut the plastic wrap
1/2&quot; before the edge of the cover.
8. You should now have a shielded box.
9. sand away a little of the paint (1 inch) on four sides where the cover hits
the metal tube.
10. Replace the cover.
