Dave,

The Alternator is on the *other* left side of the engine... you know...
the starboard left side!  (sez steve the well known dyslexic :-)

Seriously, I am a bit iffy on left/right to this day... it is on the
passenger's side, as Dave says.  The pulley track is cast into the rear
edge of the magnesium fan (and notched minutely on its forward edge to
give an alleged timing mark) and the pulley on the alternator is indeed 
steel.

                           Dyslexics of the world... UNTIE!
