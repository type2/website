Metallics are tricky to get done right and are best done as a light coat 
in a two thin coat color application with a base coat of about the same 
shade as the metallic.  Have never had a problem with using a correct 
clear coat.  If it crazes and comes off like that it is probable that 
too much hardener was used or it was sprayed on too thick over a too 
thick base.  If using a clear coat then you definately dont want to have 
too thick of a base color coat.  Personally i leave the metalics for the 
pros.

&gt;&gt; Jennifer............. Take some advise from an old guy that has seen
&gt;&gt; a lot. Don't paint your van a metallic color and don't use clear
&gt;&gt; coat on your new paint job. Both are bad ideas. The metallics fade
&gt;&gt; crack, the clear coats turn yellow and craze, sometimes coming off
&gt;&gt; in sheets.
