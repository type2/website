Subject: Fuel Injection transplant

I have a 1974 transporter with an earlier 1.7 litre engine. I presently
have a progressive Weber and I would like to get rid of it (I think most
of you know the reasoning) in favor of the J jettronic fuel injection
system from a later bus. Is there a method to adapt a 2.0 FI system to
my 1.7. I have  a set of 1.7 injectors from a 914 that could be used.
