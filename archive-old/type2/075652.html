Subject: how do you adjust torsion bars

Well it's a long ol job as there's a fair bit of dismantling to do.

You do need a clinometer and you *must* be on level ground.

Oh, and before you even think about starting it, go buy Bentley, the 
description in there is the tops.

When I rebuilt Spooky, I whacked that lot together as per Bentley and it 
came out spot on, both sides equally saggy!!! well it's down by, I guess an 
inch, but thats not so bad.

The angle that the spring plates were set was spot on (21 degrees if I 
remember right) but that does not measure the sag that will become apparent 
as soon as the thing comes down off jacks.

Like I say, I will....one day set it up a degree or so.
