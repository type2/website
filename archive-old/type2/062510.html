&gt; 23-window deluxe...but just one, man.&quot; All this and THE MAN is already
&gt; breathin' down his back! NO INOPERABLE VEHICLES, Bob!

I'm currently in remission.  (I didn't even *go* to BBTA).  As soon as 
everyone who bought one or more of my Busses picks them up (hint, hint), 
I'll be down to two.  The daily driver '81 and the garage queen '64.

Now if anyone has a *really* nice Schwinn Sting-Ray Krate ... (reliving 
my childhood and starting a new addiction). :-)
