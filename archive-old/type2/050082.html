I have used AAA for years but after perusing the latest rules in the
magazine they sent out, I will be looking around for alternatives. What I
can remember was, 1 tow per year, 4 services total per year, no towing if
stranded in snow, and a bunch of other restrictions. I have the &quot;Plus&quot;
service, good for a 100 mile tow so maybe these don't apply to me, but it's
expensive. I have always found them somewhat inflexible on the phone when
calling for help, but the guys that show up to do the service have always
been friendly and helpful and my local guy is great, very flexible.

I would also be interested in hearing about people experience with other
options, besides AAA

PS: They only towed my bus once and that was when somebody forgot to set
the parking brake and it rolled into the woods, bending a tie rod but no
sheetmetal.
