Contact them, not me.

78 Champagne Edition VW bus with sunroof.  Excellent condition, garage
kept till 1.5 years ago.  76,000 original miles.  Asking price $4400.
All service records available.

  [I've seen this bus, and it's gorgeous.  I'd like to have it, but
  it's too nice for me.  I need a winter car, and don't want to watch
  this one rust apart on me!  The interior is beautiful, and it runs
  so quietly I thought it was a waterpumper when I started it up.]

69 VW beetle, very original, excellent condition, 35,000 original
miles.  Haven't seen this one, so won't say any more about it.  Asking
price $4500.

  [Did they cost that much new? ;-) ]

Contact Ed or Jim, who are the second owners of both these vehicles.
(410) 457-4014.  Baltimore, MD area.
