Thanks to Emily Hanlon who pointed out that rotary.type2_dot_com doesn't
work too well for her but www.type2_dot_com works fine.  So amend the URL I
posted previously to:

http://www.type2_dot_com/bartnik/home.htm -- click on &quot;camping&quot;

Also http://www.type2_dot_com/bartnik/images/Cazumel_Beetle1.jpg and
http://www.type2_dot_com/bartnik/images/Cazumel_Beetle2.jpg

For those who go to check out the Beetles, my folks went on a cruise and
in Cazumel they said that Beetles converted as the one above are
plentiful there.
