&gt;Where is the positive - red - plus battery post in your bay window VW.?

If the battery is on the right by the ECU, and the terminals face the engine (left side), the right terminal nearest the taillight is the positive. This is backwards to many &quot;american&quot; batteries and you'll be asking for one with reversed terminals at most shops. VW part stores tend to carry these batteries (prices are not always good) but they always seem to have them. Interstate is the common brand in my experience.

&gt;Q2:  To what, or to where does your battery ground wire connect.  On my '78, 
&gt;since my negative ground post is toward the front of the bus, the ground 
&gt;wire is bolted to the body, just under the ECU brain connector.  I don't 
&gt;know if this is original.

Original.
