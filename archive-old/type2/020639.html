Old:
I really hate to be picky, but I would never call power brakes without
the vacuum hooked up &quot;fine working&quot;. Yes, they will stop, for a strong
person, but brakes is one area where 75% function is not something I'd
tell a stranger he could get by with. It's not that hard to make it
right.
