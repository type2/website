Thanks, all!!  I got my NEW points installed, with the dwell on my NEW 
digital (It cost $15 NEW - Sunpro 7676 model too.  Analog dwell/tach was 
$5.) dwell/tach reading 45.6...

OK.  Every one said to take your magnetic tipped screwdriver and use that to 
set the screw in the points assembly.

Opps, I did not have one!!  (In an emergency, I would normally put some 
masking tape on the tip of my screwdriver - philips or blade- and force the 
screw onto the tip.  The screw will stay on the tip of the 'driver, and I 
usually can get the screw set into the hard-to-get-at hole.)

But I did have a magnet on the tip of my magnetic pickup.  (Any magnet will 
do for this old trick.  Think about the magnet in the any one of your car 
radio speakers.  Even the single speaker, original equipment, under the 
center grill on you dash board.  It's probably still there.)

I simple 'stroked' the tip and the edge of my blade screwdriver with the 
tiny (but strong!!) magnet, and I had a magnetic tipped screwdriver!!

OK, for all you technical experts out there, would it have been better to 
stroke the screwdriver tip only one way, or back and forth?

Barry sends  '78 Westy (Later, I bought a new Bosch points from Olympic at 
$1.71.  Cheap, so why keep an old set of points in the vehicle as a backup.  
At that price,,, Again, thanks all.)
