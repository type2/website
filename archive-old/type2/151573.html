&gt;Has anyone had any experience with the Dakota digital CHT gauge?

Yes, I just installed one about 3 weeks ago. I'm very happy with it.
I believe the gauge is $109. I called and had them make me a custom
length (20ft) sender for $25.

&gt;Also are the Dakota Digital units temperature compensated for cold junction temp.

Yes.

&gt;Also;  what is the best way to get the thermocouple through the engine
&gt;cooling tin???

On my '79, I have a hole with a grommet in the body near where the fuel
rail comes through to cylinder #3. I'll have to see what wiring comes
through that, but that's where I ran my sender wires through (oil
pressure,temp,CHT).
