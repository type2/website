Subject: Re: Steering Coupling Disk
Message-ID: &lt;7jkgno$oiad_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

&gt; Question:  I have search the manuals and the web page looking for warnings or
&gt; lists of dos and donts on replacing the coupling disks, but came up with
&gt; nothing.

I had to use two box end wrenches to get in there and the bolts were pretty rusty. If the disc really is toast then pull the steering box and cut the old disc apart. Now you can use a socket to disassemble the remains and reassemble with new bolts. I was replacing the steering box anyways so it wasn't any extra work. Spray it with a lot of penetrating oil in any case!!!
