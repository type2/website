Subject: Making my road trip more fun

Howdy volks,  I've decided to make my road trip a little more fun by 
offering a little something to a lucky Type 2 listee...
        Here's my plan:   I'm going to be traveling through several states 
over the next couple of weeks.  Just for fun I'm going to offer a prize to 
one lucky listee.  One of you will correctly identify my bus by listing my 
license plate #, and date, time, and location of sighting.  Email me with 
your answer and the 2nd person to correctly identify my bus wins.
Sounds stupid?  Hope it isn't...
      If you are the 2nd to Email me you win a $10 check when I return. 
(Sorry, road trips are spendy)  Or if you choose, and decide to strike up a 
conversation or flag me down on my trip, then you have your choice of $10, 
when I return home, or $10 donated to our beloved Type 2_dot_com, or a sixpack 
of your favorite beer if  your thirst is your number 1 priority.  In the 
event that my road trip goes unnoticed, then whoo hoo, I'll drink the beer 
when I get home out on my deck.  If there isn't a 2nd listee, but only 1, 
then they get their choice of the above. (except for the 6 pack, since I'll 
have to keep rollin' along to see if there is a 2nd listee in sight)
         The states you're liable to spot me in are the following:
Idaho...Montana...Colorado...Wyoming...Utah...Nevada...
California...Oregon...or Washington.  (apologies to all Type 2 listees 
located east of these states, unless you're road tripin' too)
         My bus description is as follows:  Mint condition '77 Yellow Kombi 
with Riviera top.  I considered just not telling what state my plates are 
but then I guess everyone would be Emailing everyone else on the list to get 
the $10, or every yellow bus owner would get pulled over and questioned 
(probably on their way to work ;&lt;)  So....I've got Oregon plates.   I leave 
in the morning, on July 24th and expect to get back home on the 6th of 
August.  I'll be waving at all buses, unless they stop waving back.  Good 
luck and happy summer!
   p.s.  My bus was at the &quot;premier hippie gathering&quot; in Veneta, Or.
                     Kevin  Snow
                     '77 Kombi Riviera (my baby)
                     '72 Riviera camper
                     '78 Beetle convertible
                     '72 GMC pickup
                     '76 Chev pickup
                     '70 Chev pickup 4 x 4
                     '92 Volvo 940
                     '88 Volvo 240
                     '85 Chev Monte Carlo
                     '59 Olds Dynamic 88
                     '48 Plymouth 2 door Special Deluxe
       sorry...I always wondered what these looked like all listed at the 
same time...  Happy bussin'
