Subject: Info for 68 Westy

Just got a 1968 Westfalia and need some info. I need to repaint the poptops
and does anyone have the paint # and/or color and type of paint to use.
Also, some of the wood paneling is a might dodgy, not the headliner, and I
can get panels with 1 piece tops but not the 6-9&quot; wide strips they used.
Last is a bike rack. I don't want to shear my bike off by sticking it on the
roof, and has anyone done something other than the Hollywood type rack. 
Rob
