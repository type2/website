&gt; hello all-
&gt; I was wondering if the AFM's for 77 and 79 are interchangeable?
&gt; i know they have different part #'s. however, it seems as if I recall
&gt; being told that they you can swap them out without any problems.
&gt; is this true?

Depends on whether your is a Calif. version or not.
A 77 is 0 280 200 018.
A 78- Fed 79 is 0 280 200 020.
However VW superceded the 018 to the 020. The 020 will fit 1/76 to 78 and 79
Fed buses. [up to 12/75 used a 6 pin AFM, 0 280 200 012...1/76 and up are 7
pin]
79 Cal buses use a 0 280 200 022 AFM, because of the O2 sensor.
