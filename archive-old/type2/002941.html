Actually as always we've been here.  It is a wash, if you pull all the FI
stuff, and the engine seal, you can just barely get the firewall out without
making a botchery of it using judicious application of many putty knives (if
you don't care it will come out easy enough, and as always remember the 2
lower screws) and then can slide the tank out.  But, it is a hell of a lot
easier with no engine in, but getting a bay T4 out isn't all that easy.  So
who knows.  However the origional poster claimed a 1600 upright in the car
anyway (Euro '77 I guess) so it is a moot point the motor must come out.  I
sort of wonder how hard that is for a n upright without the removeable rear
panel, probably not much better than a T4 removal.
