&gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt; but my battery
&gt; cannot turn the
&gt; engine over fast enough. I turn the key and get a
&gt; clunk from the
&gt; solenoid and a whir rar whir sound from the engine
&gt; compartment. My
&gt; battery reads between 13.86 and 14 volts so it is
&gt; not dead. The engine
&gt; is turning just not fast. &lt;&lt;

Sounds like a grounding issue to me.  Check that the
tranny ground strap is intact and good, check the
negative battery post, and any other ground connections.
