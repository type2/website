In our 71, we camped in the Rochester, NY all winter.  The BN4 would be
used when we were awake, no problems.  When the tailpipe rotted, I used
flexible metal tubing to run the exhaust further out than stock.  I
didn't run it all night, mostly because we rarely had hookups. Better to
have good bedding or an electric blanket if hookups are available.  e
turned it on upon waking to warm up the bus- I installed a bypass switch
so I wouldn't have to get out of bed to start it from the front switch.
