Subject: [T2] heat exchanger conversion

I am thinking of putting my experiences in converting my 78 to the 72-74
style heat system on my webpage.  Instructions along with parts required
and little tid-bits about the process.  What i want to know is if any
one feels that this would be useful or not, it is a fairly straight
forward process to those who have some experience with their buses but i
was thinking it may be useful for the newbies and might prevent some
frustration.
thanks
jamie
