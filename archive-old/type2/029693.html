&gt; Asking price and selling price can be very different. For instance there is
&gt; a 1978 Champagne Edition bus listed for sale on www. traderonlie. It was
&gt; first listed for something like $15000 and the ad made a big to-do about the
&gt; unbelievably low mileage of 120,000. After being on the market for sometime
&gt; the asking price has dropped below $8000. I suspect it will go for much
&gt; less. 

There is only one possible reply... I *still* have a 1978 Champagne
Edition for sale up in Lancaster, PA for only $1000!!!  It too has &quot;only&quot;
135,000 miles :-)  It is a nice restorable bus, honest!  It is a project,
but I don't think that it is too much of a project, just more project than
I need with 3 other buses awaiting my copious &quot;free&quot; time :-)
