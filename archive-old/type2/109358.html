Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Alcohol + the bus

Hey, I was wondering about that, but I thought that it had to a have a
working stove not a toilet. I know that I had a '73 Riviera that had a stove
and DMV made me register it as an RV. Maybe its different here in Oregon. I
have also heard that the rear seat has to be a certain distance from the
driver to be able to drink in RV's.

&gt; actually, if you have a toilet you can drink in the
&gt; back of the bus while motoring down the freeway just
&gt; like a big rv.
