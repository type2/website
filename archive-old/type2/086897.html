&gt; I am currently deciding which engine configuration to get for my 73 bus. I have decided to use AVP as the rebuilder.
&gt; I am currently leaning toward the 1800cc engine,  but don't know how to decide on the hydraulic v. solid lifter question. I have a Weber progressive carb which my engine installer is going to rejet for the new engine and a Mallory distributor. Everything else (trans, clutch) is stock and in good working order.

up it to the 2liter engine, worth the couple bucks

&gt; Any suggestions on the lifter question?

I have hyd and love em on my 78
