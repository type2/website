Subject: Looking for Westfalia Part

I have a 77 Westy. Somehow the PO managed to loose the upperflap to the bed 
upstairs. I have the hinges, I have cut the appropriate size of plywood, but 
I'm looking for the metal piece that reinforces the end of the plywood that 
has snaps for the bedding to attach. As it is, it's too flexible and not 
very stable. I'll pay shipping and a reasonable price.
