Subject: [T2] Q: hog rings and seat recovering

Hey now...

I am recovering the driver's seat in my 1970 bus and I have
a question about how to attach the seat cover to the frame.
The bottom of the cover (seat part, not backrest part) has
a string running all the way around it, which is obviously used
to tighten up  the cover. Should I also use hog rings? I am
afraid of tearing the cover if I just poke them through.
I think I am dealing with a TMI cover, but I am not sure
since it was given to me (chris???). Assuming it is TMI,
do I just poke hog rings above the string?

thanks...
