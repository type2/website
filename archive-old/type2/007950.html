&gt; 	This sounds like a compleat rebuild to me. If the piston was
hammering
&gt; on the crank then the case is going to need aline-boring ( sp?) so
mite
&gt; as well just do the whole thing and have it done with. Oh and I
would at
&gt; least go with 87mm pistons instead of 85.5s they bolt right in and
&gt; increase power, especially in a bus. Good luck and keep us informed.

Nope, not such a good idea in a bus.  The bus engine was designed for
good service at 1600 cc displacement.  The cooling system was designed
to cool a 1600.  If you increase displacement, you will increase
stress throughout the engine and also increase the cooling requirements.

You can get away with this in a bug, since you will only use the
increases power for short periods of acceleration.  In a bus you will
often use the power to climb hills, so you need an engine that will
handle extra stress continuously.

You can do this in a Type 1 engine, but it will cost you!  You need a
better crank, balancing, stronger rods, careful attention to bearings,
etc. to make a reliable big engine.  If you don't do these things you
will still have a faster bus, but only for a short time!

As the old saying goes, &quot;Speed costs money, how fast do you want to
spend?&quot;
