Hello,
I think that these are still available.  A good friend
bought a new one a few years back, and it clamped to
the rear bumper of his VW Rabbit in 2 places.   He
used it to carry luggage and camping gear for the 2
adults and 5 kids that drove thousands of miles in
that little rabbit.  I don't know where to buy one
now, but I suspect that they are still available, and
should just clamp to the bumper.
