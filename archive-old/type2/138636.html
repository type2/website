&gt;How about latex? Granted there's no adhesion, but applied properly it
&gt;would hold its shape for a while. Plus when it starts to deteriorate
&gt;you could just peel it out and apply again.



Or stop in any gas station bathroom and pop a few quarters in a box on the 
wall for a replacement. The flavored kind is only for novelty and should not 
be used in this application. ;-)
