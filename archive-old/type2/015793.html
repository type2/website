&gt;My 73 Westy pop top is making a noise. I think it is in the front end
&gt;because steering changes effect it. I become aware of it at around 35 mph.
&gt;It is a steady hum and is continuous. Gets louder as speed increases.
&gt;Doesn't matter if I shift or put in the clutch. Stops the second I start to
&gt;turn the wheel to the right (but not to the left), but begins again as soon
&gt;as I straighten the wheels. I noticed it first when I went from Tucson to
&gt;Lake Havasu for Busses By the Bridge. Probably happening at lower speeds and
&gt;I just can't hear it. Any ideas, O Wizards of Busaciousness?

Most likely improper alignment manifesting itself as abnormal tire wear.
An alignment and tire rotation will probably reduce or eliminate the noise.
