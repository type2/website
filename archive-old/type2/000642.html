&quot;Is there anybody out there that would know what the original curtains in a
bus would look like, is there a website out there that might have the info?&quot;

Sorry, I don't.  If you find out, please let me know.  My 1971 Westy has no
curtains, nor any curtain hardware (expect over the sliding door).

Thanks.
