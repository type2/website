Subject: brake adjusting stars/fuel line
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Thanks to everyone who had suggestions, I already had
new stars to put in, I just had to get the old ones
out first.  I tried the bolt in the star, worked like
a charm.  BTW, a 1600 engine mount bolt is the perfect
length, size, and thread.

Also, wondered if anyone knew the proper sizes and
lengths of fuel hose for a DP 1600.  In taking apart
and putting back together, I lost the old pieces, and
need to replace them.  I'm replacing everything from
the tank back.  Any info would help.  

Thanks
