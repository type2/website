Late reply;
I checked out the # on the box.  It is 022 906 021S.  It is from a '76
high top camper.  This bus is by the way pretty much complete and is
salvageable.  It has the high fiberglass top with windows.  It is fully
equipped and seems to have most of the parts.  It supposed to have an
engine.  It has a bowen hot water heater.  But I'm afraid it's a non
catalyst.  
This guy also has two 914's with good engines to use.  Place is in
Southern NJ
