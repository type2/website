Hi Sluggo,

Check the clutch release arm on the transmission.  It's underneath the 
center (side-to-side) of the Bus, just behind the driver's side rear wheel.  
You'll probably have to get completely underneath the Bus and work over your 
head.

The clutch cable goes thru the end of the arm, and there's a wingnut on the 
end of the cable that can be tightened.  Be sure to hold the cable to keep 
it from twisting, and put a few turns on the wingnut with pliers or 
Vise-Grips.  Then, check your pedal free-play and clutch release point.  If 
it's still too high, tighten the cable some more.  You'll probably need to 
put some Liquid-Wrench on the threads, since they're exposed to road spray 
and are probably pretty rusty.

If you run out of threads to tighten the cable, your clutch is worn out and 
you need a new one.  Or, your cable has stretched and you need one of those. 
  To avoid excessive wear on your clutch and transmission, don't drive with 
your hand resting on the shifter, and don't &quot;ride&quot; the clutch when engaging 
or disengaging.

Good luck!
