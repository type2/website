Subject: Heater Box Cables
Message-ID: &lt;376DC707.A8EEABB_at_mindspring_dot_com&gt;

At the end of last year just before it went back
into hibernation I had a garage put new heaterboxes
on my 78 Bus.  When I took it out this year
I realized they had cut the previous cables and
never reattached them.  Nice huh?  So I sent
away to Bus Depot and bought two new cables.
Now as I look at the whole picture it seems I
might need some advice on how to do this.

Do I thread these new cables down some
sort of tube.  I looked like that at the back
end.    Will the old cables be useful for
feeding the new ones?  Any hints would be appreciated.

Thanks
