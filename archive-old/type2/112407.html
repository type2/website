&gt;One more thing, should I get the engine worked on before or after the

Once the bus is inside their shop they can just push it from the prep area to the paint booth. You really need to ask the shop what they require.

If you wish to get the engine compartment painted, you should get it to the painter, remove the engine and have it repaired while they prep and paint the body and engine compartment.
