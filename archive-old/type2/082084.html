Subject: '78 Westy Suspension

Hello all,

I'd like to take my bus on a long highway trip and would like suggestions on 
what parts of the front suspension I should change to make the bus feel a 
little more solid at freeway speeds.  I'm considering buying torsion arms w/ 
ball joints already installed (set of 4 from Bus Boys, I believe...), new tie 
rods w/ ends, rebuilt steering box and new steering damper.  Do I need anything 
else?  Would anyone suggest anything else?  I'm at a point where I can spend 
some money and would like to do it right.  What about the 4-holed steering 
coupler?  Any reason to replace that?

Any comments on lowering the bus?  I see specialized parts for this.  I assume 
the busses had so much ground clearance to go offroad for camping, etc.  Would 
lowering the bus help?  How difficult is this?  This bus is entirely original 
(has been in my family since day 1, had nothing done to it.  My uncle owned it 
and put no money into it.)

On a side note, I have most parts assembled for an entire rebuild of the 
original engine, but don't think I'll have the time to do the job before a 
trip.  It'll be my first rebuild, and I still have to find someone to machine 
the heads and crank, check the rods and case, etc.  In my IDEAL world, I could 
find someone -near- Houston to do the work.  Anyone know of someone local 
(meaning anywhere in south Texas)?  Any suggestions on things I can check 
(compression, etc.) that would indicate that my bus would get me home from a 
5000 mile trip before the big rebuild?

You all have already given me lots of great info in my 2 years on the list, and 
it is much appreciated!

there......)
