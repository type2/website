Subject: Re: Cleaning Alternator?

When the alternator on my VW needed cleaning, I disassembled it, and washed it
down with mineral spirits. Home Depot had a can labeled mineral spirits and a can
of paint thinner, which was 100% mineral spirits. The can labeled mineral spirits
was three times the price of the paint thinner. Also while the alternator is
apart have the bearings replaced by an alternator shop - it's cheap and a good
gaurantee.

&gt; Can anyone give me any suggestions on a product to use to clean an
&gt; alternator?  My alternator is covered with oil and grease.  Not just a little
&gt; bit, but lots of oil and grease.  I don't want to risk hurting the windings.
&gt; I remember reading somewhere, could have been Wilson, to use triclorothane
&gt; but could not find a product in the local parts store that contained
&gt; triclorothane.
