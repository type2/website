Subject: '70 front end available
Message-ID: &lt;376D19B8.110CCE87_at_cais_dot_com&gt;

Junk yard (Brandywine Foreign parts - MD) has a
fire damaged/destroyed '70 van.

Front piece looks near perfect; it has a tire
mount on it.  I think they will cut it off for
you.  Front bumper looks good, too, rear bumper
need refinishing (lotta hunked on white paint.)

Inside is all burned.  Engine is there, but major
fire damage.  Front bumper is there, and four
spare wheels.

Front doors are there, but not notable.

Missing is the front axle beam.

They probably don't know that they have it (the
'70).  They just think that they have a picked
over '79...

(Talk to Brian White - like, real nice bushy
haired guy.  Joe is kool, too - I was 'gifted' a
baggy of small parts.  Follow the rules for the
best price - no smoking, no pushing ahead in line,
spend 60 seconds of small talk up front, ask how
their day was, what's happening, etc. )
