Subject: Re: [T2] EGR filter

You can also buy bronze wool ready made at many supermarkets.

I wonder why VW needed a filter?  Many EGR systems go without one!

&gt; Actually, the filter is full of a fine bronze or copper steel wool that
&gt; doesn't rust, but it does cake and get blocked up with carbon- I cut one

&gt; fine wire (armature wire?) and ball it up and stuff a can and make one!
