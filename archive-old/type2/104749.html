Subject: Re: [T2] insulation

&gt;I have a '72 high-top (adventure wagen).  I am wanting to insulate the
&gt;inside top, can someone who has done this give me some ideas of the
&gt;materials to use?

Pink insulation is good.

Foam board for insulating the outside of houses is good when covered in 
vinyl or upholstery for appearance. Very lightweight.

Foam rubber used under upholstery (3/4&quot; thick) or carpet underlayment.

Go to a fabric shop - some specialize in foam and neoprene.

$3 a yard locally approx.
