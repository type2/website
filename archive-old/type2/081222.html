Subject: Re: [T2] FW: Bleeding brakes!

Have you adjusted the rear drums nice and tight (Shoes seat and then back
off a bit so they turn freely).  This affects pedal height more than
anything else.
Are you still seeing air when you bleed or is it nice and bubble-free fluid?
Are you bleeding from the furthest wheel in (relative to the MC)?  If the
answer is yes to all of this, get a new (or rebuilt) MC.

Subject: [T2] FW: Bleeding brakes!


&gt; Hello
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I was wondering if anyone can help me.  I have a 73 westfalia.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have renewed all the brake lines and flexi hoses.  I have bleed the
&gt; &gt; system but can not get any pedal.  If I pump the pedal I get some
presure
&gt; &gt; but then lose it again.  This makes me think it is probably the master
&gt; &gt; cylinder but there was no problem with this before I drained the system.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Does anyone have any ideas what else it could be? or is everything as I
&gt; &gt; thought pointing to the master cylinder?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Cheers
&gt; &gt; Matt
