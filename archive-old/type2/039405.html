&gt; There's a rough-looking stretch splitty out of Phoenix
&gt; (I think) with white primer on it. I believe it had a
&gt; mid-mounted Chevy small block power-plant and *lots*
&gt; of shag carpet inside!!!
&gt;
&gt; It's actually pretty cool. I've seen it at the
&gt; Prescott, Az. Flat Four Fetish show (which occurs
&gt; again, next weekend). It might be there again, so look
&gt; for it at the street-show if you go.

Take lots of pictures, and send them!!
    There's a stretch on the Vanagon screensaver i got from this list, and it
has the camper tops I was talking about.  Could have been subliminal?

    I've also been contemplating how nice it would be if there was some kind
of sunroof in my pop top.  It wouldn't have to open, but it would have to
have a closeable &quot;shade&quot; to keep insolation (incoming solar radiation) out.
The idea is to be able to lay in the bunk and look out at the stars, and have
a sun roof when the top is down.  I've also wondered about a rag top, but
that might be a bit thicker than the 1/4 fiberglass.
      Any one have any ideas?

    Dream, dream dream,
