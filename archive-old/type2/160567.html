Subject: Re: [T2] Friday Topic-horn sound

'Wimpy' gets my vote.  But it can be very disarming when dealing with potential road-rage psychopaths.  I wish mine had the same sound at 135 decibels or more.  I've had run-ins.  Cheers...KR

wondering why they wanted to kill me and trying to figure out how to let 
them know that I was truely sorry for whatever I had done, when I heard the 
familiar sound of a Volkswagen horn.  In the northbound lanes of I-95 was a 
brown vanagon and the driver was waving.  In my haste to acknowledge the 
only vehicle that didn't seem bent on my homicide, I tried to flash my 
lights, hit my horn, open my window, and wave, simultaneously, while 
continuing to steer.  I almost punched myself in the face but managed to get 
a short frantic wave off before he dissapeared.
     The point of this story, or actually the question I ask, is this: what 
is the word for the sound of a Volkswagen horn?  The closest approximation I 
can come up with is 'meeept!'
