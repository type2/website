&gt;Subject: RE: Lowering the Flame suit...

&gt;Anyway, I was wondering if anyone knows what the correct distance should
&gt;be between the rear spring plates and the upper or lower end stops.
&gt;This would allow us to determine whether the rear is sagging or not
&gt;without using a spirit level (which is only any use when the ground is
&gt;also level).
&gt;FYI my spring plates are roughly half way between the stops, I don't
&gt;know whether this constitutes a &quot;saggy butt&quot; or not.  Anyone care to
&gt;chip in?
 
 Dave &amp; the List,

 I just had a look at my '76 Crew Cab that had the rear suspension
 re-set several years ago.It sits basically level or maybe very
 slightly higher in the rear (no more than about 1/2&quot; anyway)

 The distance between the spring plate and the lower stop-end is
 pretty close to 1/2&quot;.

 If yours is sitting halfway between the two stop-ends that sounds
 a little low (IMO) I can carry a considerable load in my truck
 before it lowers to that point.

 Of course,YMMV...
