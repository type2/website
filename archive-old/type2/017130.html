X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Volks,
My sincerest apologies for fowarding that virus to the list. I've got it
cleaned off my system, and have taken steps to insure that it does not happen
again.

If, by any chance, you opened HAPPY99.EXE, you have become infected also. Go
to this page for instructions on how to get rid of it. DO NOT send any e-mails
until you do so. It is very simple to do.

If you live in San Francisco, I offer to personally come to your house and
remove it.
