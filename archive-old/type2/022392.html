&gt; Yup, I'd agree with this. Things get more marginal in a genuinly hot

I still think the stock cooling system is underengineered.  I have no doubt that my engine would melt down in short order if I held it at 79mph for any length of time.  This would require full throttle and nearly 5000rpm in my bus.  I have a new engine compartment seal, functioning thermostat, and all seals in place.  It was also my understanding that redline for a 2-liter bus motor is 4400rpm.  I'm sure it's higher for the Porsche engines.  My engine has never seen 5000rpm, much less 5200 or 5400.  It does just fine at 65mph/3900rpm though.
