&gt; I was wondering if the bar from a 71 would fit, since I have a POS 71 bus, 
&gt; but I seem to remember someone posting about a 71 beam being slightly wider 
&gt; than a 68-70.

You'll have to try it.

&gt;   Will driving with it broken cause any damage to the front end?

Only if the metal parts are jabbing at something.  Otherwise, you will
experience poorer handling but no other problems.

&gt; The metal clamps that go around the bar look like they would be a pain 
&gt; to put back on, any tips?

The clamps are held on by tapered sheet metal clips.  You bend the locking
tab, then tap the clip off with hammer and punch.  I also find channelock
pliers to be useful for this.  Putting it back on is the reverse of
disassembly.  Not a huge task unless things are rusted.  If they are, it
might be easier to cut them off and replace them.  Be sure replacements
are in hand before cutting, though!
