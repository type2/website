&gt; &gt;since I lived in Europe 30 years ago I have always used Michelins, have
&gt; &gt;205/70R14s MXT's on mine now with no complaints

&gt; Wasn't it pointed out once that French Michelins are not the same as US ones produced at the Dunlop plant?

Well, having two michelin tires shed their treads with severe body damage
in both cases, I'm not too enthused about Michelin quality.  Seeing as how
some rave about how good they are there must be some variability in their
construction.
