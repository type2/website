I decided to break open the regulator as recommended,
and sure enough, one of the contacts was soldered shut. 
The chunk of metal that was previously molten was
reached accross appoximately 1/16 inch.  I took my
trusty points file, filed all four contact locations, slapped
it back together and shazam!  it worked.
I'll still procure a Bosch regulator to have on hand as
two of the points were cupped pretty severely.
glad to be cruisin' again
