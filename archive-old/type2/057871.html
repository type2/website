Subject: Re: exhaust manifold studs

Sorry to be late in replying to you, but this is one of those jobs where
the only proper course of action, if you are not a professional machinist,
is to load the engine up and take it to a professional machinist.

Sometimes you can get a broken stud out using any or all of the home
tricks, heat, vise-grips, pounded-on sockets, I've even heard of one or
two folk who have had luck with easy-outs......*BUT*....  if they don't
work, you wind up at the machinist anyway and he will curse your
first-born if he has to deal with a mess you have made for him! 

I sheared a fan off the hub on a T4 engine once and had 3 broken bolts and
a sheared roll pin to deal with.  I pulled that hub, looked at it, and
thought, &quot;I *might* get all 4 of these items out peacefully&quot;.  Then I
thought, &quot;and what if I don't?&quot;  I brought that hub to a machinist near
closing time and he asked when I walked in what I had done to remove them.
I told him &quot;nothing, you get first shot&quot; and he brightened up
considerably. I had that hub back clean in 1/2 hour, but I am sure that if
he had had to deal with a broken-off easy-out, I would have received much
less willing/speedy service.

Broken head studs will be *much* more difficult to remove than those
sheared bolts, and I strongly advise that you give a pro first shot!

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
