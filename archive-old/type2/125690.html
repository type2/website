&gt;I am thinking about buying a puller for this. CIP wants $44.95 US for the
&gt;Bugpack tool. It is more in Canada. Someone mentioned the Hazet tool.
&gt;Any advice about where to find a quality tool for this job and prices? It kind
&gt;of has to be the specialized tool made for this application. 2 or 3 jaw
&gt;pullers won't cut it.

Hazet is #1 in Germany of course but you all those tools like like they are cast the same way...I have no complains from the CIP1 tool (1014 made by Sir Tools). There are a few brands available as well to choose from. I think ZDMAK may have the best price on this tool (and the exchange rate is pretty good for CDN these days right?)
