Subject: What Wires Where?? (COIL)
To: &lt;Type2_at_type2_dot_com&gt;
Mime-Version: 1.0
Message-ID: &lt;72.aa58153.2831a253_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I just replace the coil on my 78 FI 2.0L bus.  But, while doing so I mixed up the wires.  I don't know which wires go on which terminal of the coil, 1 or 15.
Could anyone help, please??  Some addition info, the engine is FI with an electronic egnition.  It also has AC.  Thanks Micheal
