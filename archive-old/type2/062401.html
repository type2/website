Subject: Soupin' up...

So one of the valve seats in my '65 is shot, and some of the other
valve springs got beat up due to my negligence this past summer, and
there's a helicoil in one of the spark plug sockets, and the machinist
who put it in said the metal is fatiguing or something, so all in all
it sounds like its time to replace this cylinder head.  I could do a
valve job, but the helicoil (an emergency job while on the road) would
still be there...

But this has me thinking that maybe this is an opportunity to maybe
get a little more juice out of the thing..  The first thing that comes
to mind is getting dual carbs (and therefore new dual port heads,
right?)  How much of a performance increase can I expect from this?
This would cost a few hundred dollars, so I want to make sure it would
be worth it.  Also, any guesses on the effects on reliability?  I
spend a lot of time goofing around on obscure Forest Service roads and
the like, so it needs to work reliably.  Are there other parts of the
system I would also have to beef up?  I'm no power junkie, but it
might be nice to be a little faster on those uphills.  

Any opinions on mailorder companies that sell heads?  From looking at
VW Trends, I see So Cal Imports, Nopi Custom &amp; Performance, and maybe
some others.  Any good or bad experiences?

Thanks.
