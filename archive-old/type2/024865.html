&lt;&lt; ommended leaving the thermostatically controlled flaps
 out of the engine  &gt;&gt;

well i was originally going to just post this to you...but rewrote it for the
entire post..i am interested to hear some feedback on this.  first never,
never take the thermostat out of the engine....ask yourself why was it there
in the first place??  it not only cools the engine but allows the engine
proper warm-up...( by having no thermostat you keep the engine too cold...not
allowing all parts to warm and expand the way they were designed.)  side note:
gene berg enterprises uses stock thermostats on ALL cars that leave their
shop.....including their drag racers which turn low 12's and better.  if these
dont need extra cooling please forgive me...then why would you??

second....as to the valve seats needing replaced that is open to much
discussion.  but i do have an interesting fact for you.  a service bulletin
from volks of amer.  stated that all head repairs were to be done by heating
the head to 400+ degrees then sub freezing the valve guides and seats to -100
degrees minimum....thus allowing a super tight fit and hold when these two
parts were installed into a head.  hmmmm...i dont know of a single shop in the
entire world that does this.  all that i know off just press in the seats and
guides.  gives you all something to think about.  to my knowledge vwoa
manufactured all their heads new this way also.  ( my 73 van has 225,000+
miles as of this week and no dropped valve seats here..... nor any head work
done....)  regular adjustments can literally do wonders.
