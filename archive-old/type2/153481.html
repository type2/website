Next time you are on I-40, take Rt. 66 ( National Trails Highway) between 
Ludlow and Mountain Springs Road (Essex )and it will bypass the construction 
sites. But be careful. The speed limit is 55 and the CHP have some hiding 
places.

&gt;I made it!

&gt; To make things worse, I-40 in AZ
&gt; had bunches of construction knocking the highway down to one lane in two
&gt; separate places. Bridge work it seems. Grrr... Took over an hour to go 10
&gt; miles. In the brutal heat. Bastages!
