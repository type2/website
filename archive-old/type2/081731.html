From: &quot;Nicholas Palmer&quot; &lt;nicholas_at_slackers_dot_net&gt;
&gt; So I took my bus to Bugformance of Sacramento, and asked them to replace
&gt; the EGR valve, and make it pass SMOG. So I took it into the SMOG check
&gt; station, and it failed by an order of magnitude. They mechanic said he had
&gt; tuned it to where it &quot;runs best&quot;, and that it should pass smog. So I
&gt; dialed the CO mixture screw as lean as it would go, and saw absolutely NO
&gt; change on the retest.
&gt; 
&gt; So my thinking is that they somehow screwed up the AFM. Any other
&gt; suggestions on what might cause the problem, and does anybody on the list
&gt; in the Sacramento area have a sniffer I could use?
 
Does Sacramento area do smog check II on a dyno? Or just a static test?
Is it a gross polluter?
What were the exact figures for HC, CO, and NoX?
