Subject: fuel pump weirdness...

This just keeps getting weirder and weirder.....
 
I've been working on finding the fault in the wiring for a few hours.  The fuel pump is &quot;hot&quot; all the time the battery is connected, not just when the key is in the ignition....
 
When I disconnected the brown (supposed to be red) line from the solenoid than runs current over the transmission and to the engine compartment, the fuel pump finally went &quot;cold&quot;.
 
But of course I need juice in that line to run the motor.  I re-connected it.  I disconnected the ignition coil completely - fuel pump still &quot;hot&quot;.
 
I disconnected the auxillary air regulator, the cold start valve and the thermo-time switch (I thought I might have connected them incorrectly) - fuel pump still &quot;hot&quot;.
 
Any ideas?  What thing in the engine should be &quot;hot&quot; all the time?
 
Thanks for any help you can give me....

Marc
