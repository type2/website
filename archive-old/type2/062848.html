Subject: Split:Hand Brake Pin

Braker Braker:

Any one with a split ever actually remove 211.711.341A from a
bus?  That's &quot;Pin-Hand brake lever from Chassis No. 20-041.712&quot;
for those who don't have the part numbers memorized.

With all the items I've removed and replaced on my '67 Deluxe,
I've never been able to budge mine.  The hand-brake lever is
nearly impossible to move and I'm looking to pull the mechanism
apart so it can be properly cleaned and lubricated.  Those of you
in NEATO already know I can be rather &quot;anal&quot; about these things
and it just bugs me that I can't remove the pin.

If you know the piece, you know the problem (aside from the rust
issue) is that there's no easy way to leverage it.  I have soaked
(literally, with a can-full stuck up there for a week) the thing
in Liquid Wrench.  I have applied heat, a la propane torch.  When
I had the steering gear out I even tried a clamp between the left
frame member and the pin.  I have mangled one end of the pin with
vice grips attempting to turn it (even used a clamp to close the
vice grips for a TIGHT fit), but the metal is so soft it just
chews it up.

I'm ready to drill it out (if I can get a drill up there) and put
one in from a parts bus--if I can get one out of the hulk out
without ruining it.  Anyone with experience with this one?
