Subject: Re: [T2] Sticking door locks

Hiya All,

Been following this thread with some interest.  I've gone through the 
doorlocks on my Bus and reconditioned them.  When I did this the advice I had from 
two local locksmiths was the identical.  Clean the lock tumbler/keyway unit out 
with a good solvent such as brake cleaner and then lubricate with Tri-Flow 
(both specified this by name).

I got brake cleaner in an aerosol can and filled a paper cup with the stuff.  
I dunked the tumbler in the juice and let it set there for an hour.  At that 
point I agitated it with a pair of needlenose.  Amazing what came out of that 
thing!  Got it out and shot brake cleaner into the keyway with the little red 
tube gizmo on the aerosol can.  Let it dry out and lubed it up generously with 
Tri-Flow.

The locks have performed flawlessly since and that has been for the past two 
years.

One word.......I have not seen Tri-Flow used a bike chain lubricant (doesn't 
mean that it can't be used that way - but that use is certainly not what I'd 
associate with the product). I find it easily enough in a variety of local 
stores.  Added bonus - it smells like bananas!
