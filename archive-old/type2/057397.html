   Well, some do, but a lot of cheaper ones don't. And almost all
electric pumps (and I'm not even talking about the FI pumps which are
*really* high pressure) put out far more pressure than the VW mechanical
pump. So you need to get one of those little regulators with the &quot;dial&quot;
on the top to set the pressure down. Ask your FLAPS.
