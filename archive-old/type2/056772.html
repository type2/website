Subject: Re: Windshield wipers

&gt;I started  having a problem with the wipers in my 82' westy today when 
the
&gt;rains came down....It started with the passanger wiper quiting all
&gt;together....now the driver side wiper has quit too....the wiper moter 
is
&gt;still making noise as if it is still working and the blades are trying 
to
&gt;move, but only manage to make spastic little motions......any idea of 
what
&gt;happened here??

Yep, I know exactly what happened.  Your wiper linkage has come apart. 
Have fun pulling the wiper motor!  You might have to pull the dash back 
to get to it.

This happened to me in the '78 Bus I used to have.  The single 10mm nut 
that holds the wiper linkage to the wiper motor unscrewed itself and 
fell off.  This allowed the drive crank for the linkage to pop off of 
the wiper motor.  The motor whirred happily away but the wipers stopped 
moving.  Of course this was at 60 mph in a pouring rain on Interstate 
81!
