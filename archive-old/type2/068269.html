Subject: re: Another Jalousie Window Question

The interior &quot;trim&quot; piece that was between the window frame of the body and
the actual jalousie window(s) on the splittie buses was, a light weight
metal frame that was painted to approximate woodgrain. It was secured to
each window opening by small screws in each corner.
