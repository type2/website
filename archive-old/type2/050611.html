Subject: [T2] Show Stoppers for sale.

Listees,
    I was in the local hobby shop today picking up a pinewood derby car for
my son, and saw the &quot;show stoppers&quot; car set that consists of a vw
transporter, trailer, and vw.  It is a really nice set.  I bought 2 extra
for the list at $22 each including my local tax.  If anyone wants one, pmail
me.
