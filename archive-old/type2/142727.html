Subject: Re: [T2] microbus news

&gt; consider the fact that your Volkswagen Bus is not only polluting the
environment at a significantly higher amount than a typical SUV, but you more
than likely also get worse or similar fuel economy to some of the most massive
SUV's available on the road today.


But the pollution and eco damage done by building a new vehicle is
worth decades of lower emissions. Especially a luxo-barge big SUV.
Driving a bus keeps you ahead of the curve there.

As for the speedos and spandex... Ew. Keep that crap on the other side
of the pond. ;-)
