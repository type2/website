I agree that the compression is not sufficient to hold your bus on a steep 
hill.
You should be sure to turn your wheels and let the bus roll and rest the 
front wheels against the curb.
Facing up hill cut your wheels to the left and facing down hill cut your 
wheels to the right.
This should be done even if you have a working e-brake just in case it fails.
