Subject: How much how fast? (oil)

------=_NextPart_001_0001_01C20E7F.4589F620

How often do you find yourself adding oil?  And how much oil do you find =
yourself adding?
Do most of you use 15-40 or 20-50?  Any preferences in brand?  I know som=
e swear by Lucas.  How much of it do you usually put in when doing an oil=
 change?

I have been using 15-40 chevron and use Lucas with my oil changes.  I hav=
e a 20-30 min. highway commute to work 5 days a week and usually find mys=
elf adding a little oil every other days.

Just curious
Thanks,
Kyle
