&gt;
&gt;I can't find the shift rod REAR nylon bushing.  Got the front one on
&gt;order.

The Bently lists a different nylon bushing for the rear of the shift rod,
but I found that another one like the front one works just fine in the 
same location. In fact, I left the original two bushings on the rod
in the middle of the rod and right at the rear end to help provide
a little extra support and stiffness. Since replacing all of the plastic
parts of the shifting  mechanism, the old bus feels like a new
car!

An aside: The nylon bushing for the very front that goes under the shifter
has a hole in the center that is still too big for the installation. It
was a sloppy fit on my bus when installed. I am making a set of
replacement ones out of Delrin (Hard, slippery plastic) on the lathe
when I get a chance. Ill let you all know how they turn out.
