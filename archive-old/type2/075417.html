I'm going to print out all of the request that I get and give them to the
Vanagon owner, that way I won't be adding anything to your price and
everybody will get the best deal possible.......
If he doesn't want to handle them I will.
You can count on them being shipped from Austin Texas about the same rate
as from Dallas TX 75220 if you want to gestimate your freight go to

------------ Original Message----------------
I'm making a 320 mile trip this Saturday to scavenge 82 Air Cooled
Vanagon parts.
If you're need anything for 80-83 aircooled let me know.
The parts that are already spoken for are:
Tranny, Heater Boxes, Crossover pipe, rear bumper, engine, FI system.
Everything else is there and If I don't have to hold, clean it these
parts will be cheap.
Whatever I don't get: the owner is going to put on E-bay Sunday night.
Speak up now!
