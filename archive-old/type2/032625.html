Subject: Cigarette Lighter Woes

Greetings Gurus -

The power wire for my lighter comes from a headlight switch terminal that's
always hot, and has a normal &quot;flat&quot; electrical connector at the headlight
switch and a round, female connector (similar to a small spark plug wire)
that attaches at a 90 degree angle to the end of the lighter assembly. Stock
or not?

This wire looks like the plastic insulation is cracked and about to expose
bare wire. Should this wire carry an in-line fuse? If so, what rating?

I have traced the stoppage of electricity to the barrel-like looking thing
(capacitor?) on the lighter that the hot wire plugs into. Is this a
replaceable item?

I've looked thru WCM's site, and they have Bug lighters that don't look like
the one in my bus. Should the Bug lighters be a good fit for my bus? I'm not
a fanatic about keeping everything &quot;original&quot;.

Thanks -
