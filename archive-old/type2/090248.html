Subject: Re: [T2] installed bap engine wont run

Brutal. At least you might have tossed a little helpful info along with
the beating.

I would first verify TDC/#1 firing position. Spin it to tdc and check to
see if both valves at #1 have gaps if not spin it 360deg.
Now is the rotor pointing at your #1 plug wire? Are the plug wires in the
right order/right way round? do you have static timing close enough to get
a start? (maybe a little before tdc depends on the dizzy).
Give it another try. You said youre getting fuel. Did you check spark?
If it still doesnt start just verify the valves are set right. Youu might
check compression just to be sure but this is a new rebuild so I hope the
compression is OK. Gas, Spark, Compression and timing in the ballpark
should get something out of it.
   good luck

&gt; Unfortunately, You get what you pay for.  They sell motors so cheap you can
&gt; be assured they won't last.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; just installed our new bap 1600 in our bus. went to start it and it turns
&gt; &gt; over, thre is gas going through the filter but wont start. Had a few
&gt; flames
&gt; &gt; shoot out the exhaust but that is it. When i installed the dist. they said
&gt; &gt; the engine was set at tdc#1, but the rotor was pointing about 180' away
&gt; from
&gt; &gt; the #1 mark which is at about 5-6oclock pointing directly at me should the
&gt; &gt; dist. be turned so the mark at about 12-1oclock, or is the engine not set
&gt; &gt; right. Thanks
