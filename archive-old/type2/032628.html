Mates,

In an effort to keep this short:

I've a 78 block from which I've already removed the RIGHT cylinder head.
Trouble is the left.  I can't get the LEFT head off because the tin shroud
which surrounds the oil cooler is in the way.  The tin won't come-off as I
can't get the bloomin' fan off - though I've removed the big ol' bolt in the
middle per Muir.  It just won't move!  There ARE four (if I remember
correctly) square-headed nuts on the fan, but they reside against the outer
rim of the fan and therefore can't be turned...

Incidentally, if someone in the ethos can tell me how to properly remove the
fan mebbe I'll finally get a crack at removing that damned front fan
housing.  Hopefully several birds with one stone?

TIA

Justin
78 Westy
