&gt;When backing the #2 plug out, there was a bit or resistance, and after being
unable to &gt;get the compression tester threaded, I checked with a flashlight and
saw that that the &gt;threads were basically gone.
&gt;I was real discouraged yesterday. So what should I do?

Check the plugs you took out. There is an off chance that there will be a spark
plug insert
on the plug that went in that hole. If that's the case, cover the outside of the
insert
with loctite, then reinstall the plugs, wait for the loctite to dry, then try
removing that
plug again, this time without the insert.

If there is no insert you may be able to install one. There is a chaser/threader
you can
buy - like an installation kit. It would probably be easier with the motor out.
Worse case
scenario you buy a rebuild head and switch the head - also motor comes out.


&gt;grinds a bit when shifting into reverse) after &gt;driving the new clutch for
about a month, &gt;and when I crawled under to tighten the wingnut, &gt;I found that
it was basically tightened &gt;as far as it could go. Any advice here? New Cable?
&gt;Is it typical to have it loosen up &gt;like that after having a new clutch
installed?

You can place some washers/spacers between the wingnut and the eyehole, But I'd
want to know why it's like that too.



Thanks for any help and encouragement
