Subject: Re: [T2] John Brown's Buses

not gonna steal the thunder but got back from a day at Harper's ferry. my
bus ran like Sh*t up and back but made it. still can't figure out what is
causeing the intermittent problems.

but up at JBB things were great, saw lots of old friends met many who were
just names on a computer screen and some neat new and old buses.  about 25
or so showed up.  rained like a banshee on Friday but the sun was out by
the time I arrived Sat.  got a few photos and yacked, the gang from Canada
was there in all their Canadian glory...not sure who came furtherest but I
only had to come about 50 miles and my bus was not happy about that, no
power but ran smooth and cool...???????

way to go guys
