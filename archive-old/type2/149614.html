Subject: 1600 vs. 1776 : mileage

   I'm sure this has been covered in the past, but I did a search and was 
unable to turn up anything in the archives. Sorry if this is horribly 
redundant...

   I am looking into options for my dear '69 Westy which I had to leave 
behind in Denver while on my way to Wilmington, North Carolina after the 
engine(s) seized (you may have read the saga). While what I'd really love to 
do is put a diesel engine in and run biodiesel, I'm not sure that I'm in a 
position to make that happen (the shop where I plan to have the engine 
rebuilt and installed won't do it -- I'm guessing it's something I'm going 
to have to research and do myself as a major project sometime in the 
future).

   I may have the option of having the engine rebuilt to a 1600 or a 1776. I 
had opted for the 1776 originally for the power, but I'm wondering if the 
gas mileage will be significantly less? If I'm going to have to pay the gas 
company for the extra power I think I'd rather stick with the 1600.

  Anyone know or have any experience with this?

   TIA!

   - Greg Smith
