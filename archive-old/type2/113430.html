&gt;&quot;Should be available at least by special order at most FLAPS. For sure

&gt;I thought so too, but my local large napa said they don't carry anything 
&gt;that big.  I'll try some others - Thanks.

NAPA has a professional tools catalog and they are in there. Your counter 
man just doesn't want to take the time to look them up. I got my set at 
NAPA so I know they do carry them in the warehouse, but not all (few) 
dealers stock them. Napa stores differ. Some will look up and special order 
things for you, some want nothing to do with special orders. It varies from 
store to store and even among the counter people at the same store. Some 
are just drawing wages and some love to encourage and promote all DIY auto 
interests.

Somewhere out there is a NAPA counter man that is a VW nut and knows all 
the few items that NAPA carries that actually do fit right and work well. 
Example: NAPA sells Valvoline &quot;Ford Tractor Lube&quot; which in fact is rated 
GL4 and correct spec for early VW/Porsche transaxles. I would bet less than 
10% of NAPA counter people know this, so if you ask them by spec, they 
can't find it. Or, they advise, &quot;Look here, meets GL4 and GL5 specs, that's 
what you need.&quot; If you use it, cut 80% out of the life of your synchros. 
Likewise, if you ask them for a thread die 18X1.5mm, they can't find it in 
the index. If, however, you ask for axel thread reforming dies, viola, if 
they want to look it up they can, then find the kit, them find the list of 
kit parts and pick the right one, and check the warehouse for stock, order 
it, cash in full please for special orders, be here in 2 days.

I would consider trying an outlying smaller NAPA store. Special orders slow 
things down and a smaller store may be willing to take the time to get the 
sale than a high volume store that tells the counter people, &quot;Never spend 
more than 3 minutes to make a sale!!! Say you ain't got it and try and sell 
them what you do!!!&quot; That's why NAPA's are independent. The franchise 
holder/store owner has latitude with regard to his approach to sales for 
his location. Find a counter man with the right attitude, then pay his 
price without bitchin' cause you will end up with great value if you always 
get the right stuff that fits and works properly, a true concern and 
correction if any issues develop. It's been verified by someone who knows 
and cares.

So, yes, you have the right conclusion. Try a few other counter's, or at 
different times of day. It may be only the late shift at your megastore 
that has a VW nut workin' there. Watch where the employees park and when 
you see an old cherry Beattle or Bus parked there, go in and find out who 
owns it and talk to them.
