Subject: Re: [T2] more carb discussion

&gt;Thanks for the helpful advice!! A listee has a set of OE solex carbs and
&gt;linkage in my price bracket.  I'll rebuild them and hopefully be a happy
&gt;camper (quite literally :) ).  I'm filing the dellorto advice and if I don't
&gt;like the solexes, I can save my money for them.  FI is a scarey thing to me -
&gt;probably irrationally so, but either way, I'm comfortable with carbs.

Not trying to &quot;beat you up&quot; or anything but dual carbs - especially dual 
carbs like Dells and Webers - are as complicated (if not more) and more 
expensive (if not more) than the factory EFI. Aftermarket EFI is more 
expensive granted.

The factory EFI is not a scarey beast once you take a few days to learn it.

It took me two weeks to learn to successfully rebuild, balance, and then 
rejet my 36mm Dell DRLA carbs. Took over a month just to gather the parts.

Nothing simple about those fancy carbs.

FWIW I will use the DRLA carbs on my Type IV powered Beetle and EFI on my 
Corvair powered Westy (when I can get around to switching to EFI from stock 
Corvair carbs).

Oh - and I just noticed the OEM Solex part. Okay - I'd go with stock carbs 
no problem. Never mind! &lt;grin&gt;

Whatever you do - good luck to ya.
