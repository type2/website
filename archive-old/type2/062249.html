     I've heard about this yielding to the right business, sounds damn 
     scary to me..
     
     Anyway, a bunch of us from the UK are going to drive our buses to 
     Norway next summer to collect - big time. My mate went over this year 
     and got sick of seeing old VW's in farmyards in the north. He's got a 
     Norwegian speaking girlfriend so we are sorted there. I'm gonna take 
     the single cab and fill it with doors, etc..
