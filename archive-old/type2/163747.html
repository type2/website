&gt; I have seen 21 windows in absolutely pristine shape going for much more
&gt; than that....some have been advertiesed for over $30,000....and sold.
&gt; 
&gt; When you spend that kind of money, an engine rebuild is the least of your
&gt; worries....pocket change actually.
&gt; 
&gt; On the baywindow side, I have noticed prices have started creeping
&gt; up...especially for single and double cabs.

It's an inverse bell curve...Most cars follow it. Prices drop as the
car depreciates (and ages) 'til it hits that point of not being &quot;old&quot;
but &quot;collectible&quot;; then the prices rise as it gets more and more
&quot;antiquey&quot;... ;-)
BTW, most amateur collectors end up with the cars they would
have bought (if they had the money then) or actually had when
they were 18-24 years old...Serious collectors (like Jay Leno)
just buy eveything else...;-)
