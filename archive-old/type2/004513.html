   Hey There.
Just wondering if one of these coolers will keep beer cold if I put the beer
in cold?:0
Seriously:) I got one last Xmas from my Dad and just bought the power supply
for 120VAC. I plugged it in the other day in the garage in 30 Deg C shade
and was suprised at how cool it felt when I stuck my hand (and head:) in ! I
plan on running it throu the cig liter plug while driving and running it off
ground power at night while camping. This will be off the main starting
battery. Anyone have any comments on how this'll work or similar experience
with Koolatron coolers.

Thanks
