Subject: Re: [T2] VW Trends

Maybe a more general vintage European cars - not just the Ferrari/Jaguar/Rolls Royce/Porsche/BMW crowd. 

Plenty of those mags. 

Do serious looks at ALL European cars - and concetrate on the working man's cars. Fiats, Lancia, Citroen, VW, Rover, MG, Austin, Austin Healey, etc etc. Cars, trucks, motorcycles, Caravan vehicles, commerical vehicles. LOTS of pics.

Maybe something about a rich man's car, something about a working man's car, a commerical vehicle, something 2 wheeled, etc. Ought to appeal to a wide range of readers. Leave the bikini's and other attractions favored by the 17 year old crowd to another magazine. I can see all the boobs and butts in other magazines... 

I'd subscribe real damn quick. They'd better keep it from being condescending towards the common cars or they are junk to me!

Chris
