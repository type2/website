Subject: Re: [T2] Opening Back WIndow?

  I'm assuming you have already considered the rear safari kits out there.  I've thought about that, but I'm not the thrilled with the looks of the frame on a bay.
   
  Now a jalousie type window would be cool.  I've even come across some windows for small rear hatch splitties that had a slider window, similar to those used on some of the Rivieras on the cargo doors.

  Has anybody done this? Replace the window in the back
end with one that opens, I mean. Would anybody be
interested in getting one if it became available?
