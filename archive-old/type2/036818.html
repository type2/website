Subject: Wanted 091 ZF limited slip

Subject line says it, looking for a good used (as in you've run it and
it works, else you've seen it apart and the friction discs are in good
condition) limited slip for an 091 tranny (may be the same diff as in
the 002.)  Will pay on the order of $300-$700 depending on condition.
May be the model ZF5253?

If anyone has anything, including someone in Europe, please email
me with info.

If anyone in Europe knows of any source for the clutch discs for these
things, that would also be appreciated.
