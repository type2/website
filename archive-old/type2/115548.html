Subject: i don't know if this is a good idea

hello everyone.
ok, so a week or so ago I wrote an email saying that my exhaust smelt and my 
pipe to my muffler had dent in it.  Well the smell is gone after a tune up, 
but the muffler is loud and i've lost some power especially on acceleration. 
(not because of the tune up, but because of the muffler) The muffler is an 
aftermarket header. It is really stupid and I only got it because it could 
arrive 4 days sooner and I was in a rush. Any way, a pipe comes off of each 
heat exchanger (They are shaped just like a stock crossover pipe on the 79 
and ups, only there is 2 of them; a seperate one for each exchanger) They 
meet at a really small muffler. Well, I backed into a tall curb and crushed 
one of the pipes. The pipes are about 1 1/2&quot; in diameter. The one I crushed 
is flat so it is 1 1/2&quot; wide by 1/4&quot; tall. The dent is about 8&quot; long.

It is definitely affecting my bus' performance and I don't like the way it 
sounds. I don't have the cash for a new muffler and I don't know how to 
weld. Someone suggested that I cut out the dent and buy a piece of pipe 
slightly larger and use some quick weld and some clamps. Someone else 
suggested I just replace it with a piece of radiator hose or some other hose 
that can withstand the heat temporarily until I can afford to buy a new 
muffler. Is this dangerous in any way? Any thoughts?
