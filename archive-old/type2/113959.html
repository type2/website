If those miles are going to be on a long trip away from home to Scotland, then I wouldn't even consider anything like JBWeld.  Do you want to risk ruining your trip by breaking down in the middle of nowhere when the plug comes loose again?  Unfortunately, a helicoil or timesert is probably the only fix that would be reliable enough to get you through your trip.  If you can't find someone to do it, consider buying a kit and doing it yourself (you may need to delay your trip slightly or pay the extra for overnight shipping).

&gt; I am really hacked off now as I
&gt;have just spent the last three months building new cabinets and welding in
&gt;new metal ready for this trip.

That is unfortunate, but there is nothing you can do about it now except take care of the problem in a way that won't put your trip at risk.  If the plug does come loose again during your trip, you could probably drive a short distance by removing the rocker shaft assembly from that cylinder and running on three cylinders.  This should obviously be a last resort though.

Good luck,
