Subject: Re: [T2] '79 bus engine tin needed - hot running

[...]

Just a little FYI:
The left rear corner on a 79 Cal version engine is one-year-only. It has a
large round hole in it that no other one has....
Unfortunately, I don't have one.

&gt; &gt; My bus is running much hotter than before. It gets up to about 250F
whereas
&gt; &gt; it used to run about 210F with the old engine. I think my cooling flaps
are
&gt; &gt; stuck due to excess friction and a weak spring, but the flaps appear to be
&gt; &gt; stuck in the open position. The wire from the thermostat attaches to a tab
&gt; &gt; on the flaps rod. That tab points up (not forward), can someone confirm
that
&gt; &gt; that is the position for OPEN?
&gt;
&gt; I'm pretty sure that is the correct position, it is design to fail in the
&gt; open position
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I removed the dead A/C from the bus during the rebuild, so now I have a
big
&gt; &gt; hole where the A/C used to be. This is probably the main cause of my hot
&gt;
&gt; I did the same and had the same problem
&gt;
&gt; &gt; engine since the hole is right above the cat converter ('79 CA) bus. Does
&gt; &gt; anyone have this missing piece of engine tin (left rear, upper) that they
&gt; &gt; can sell to me?
&gt;
&gt; two things, there is the piece of tin, I needed one for my bus but got two
&gt; so I can send you the other. the bigger problem is where thy cut the bus
&gt; metal to enlarge that opening, there is supposedly a piece that fits there
&gt; but I have never been able to find one so I fabricated a piece and welded
&gt; it up, took all of one Sat.  I'm not the best weldor.
