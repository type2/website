Subject: re:compressed air substitute

Although I don't clean carburetors every day and I do have an air 
compressor, I have found that the ubiquitous WD-40 with the nozzle pipe 
does an excellent job of cleaning out small passages and jets.  It is 
not a substitute for disassembly and cleaning but it sure is quicker 
than draging out the air compressor just to blow out some holes.
