Subject: Re: Help with push rod tubes

An addendum to the removal of push rod tubes.
Getting oily push rod tubes out can be a real pain.
The walls are thin so one can't use gripping tools.
Clean the outside best you can, rotate the tubes first to release 
seals.  You'll bust knuckles doing this no matter what you do so 
prepare yourself for it.  I finally made a tool to assist in removal.
Take a wooden dowel slightly smaller that the ID of the tube.
Drill a hole lengthwise through the dowel.  Total length at least 6 
inches, 8 would be better, but harder to drill.
about 20 mm (3/4 inch) from one end cut the dowel at a diagonal.
I happen to have some thin sheet &amp; I made 2 oval washers from it 
and placed them in the diagonal cut slot (could use plastic tape 
tho) and assembled the tool.  Insert a long bolt through the assembly 
with the bolt head on the short dowel side.  Insert into tube and 
tighten the bolt.  Tightening the diagonal cut dowel increases the 
effective diameter of the dowel wedging it inside the tube allowing 
mere mortals to easily rotate the tube/tool and thusly pulling it 
out!  Another tool to add to you war chest. Cheap, easy, and it's 
yours.  Wood won't scratch tube.  Undersize dowel may dent tube a 
little.  Crushing with pliers is fatal to tube.
