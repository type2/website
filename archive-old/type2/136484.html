&gt; I also love that busses are relatively rare. I spent a week in Denver

&gt; in various states of disrepair in someone's driveway.

Maybe they're more rare in Denver? Up here in Lethbridge (Alberta, Canada) 
pop. 70,000, there are five busses in my neighborhood alone. I know of at 
least eight more...
