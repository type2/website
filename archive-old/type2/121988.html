Subject: Re: [T2] painting the tin (color other than black)

Hi Mike,

THEORY on the list says black is best.

Personally, I wonder about that. Since the engine compartment is in 
darkness most of the time, how can the colour matter?  Would it make a 
difference if the top was in colour, and the side facing the engine was 
black?

Realisyically I think the colour of the tin is irrelevant. I have never 
seen any empirical evidence to prove otherwise. I have never seen the 
THEORY mentioned above proven to make a recordable difference in 
operating temperatures in the real world. (YMMV) . Sure the factory 
used black, but black is the cheapest colour they can buy, so why 
wouldn't they?  The job of the tin is NOT to radiate heat, it's to 
control the flow of air. Any secondary cooling effect is incidental at 
best, and I would suggest that the affect of colour at this point is 
insignificant. Again, YMMV. Until someone puts a metered engine on a 
stand and runs it with two sets of different coloured but otherwise 
identical tinwork, we'll never know for sure.

The tin on my westfakia's motor is fire engine red, and I'm currently 
assembling an engine for my Dad's 75 westy  with tin painted John Deere 
green. We're using standard tremclad as I don't think that tin usually 
gets any hotter than a couple hundred degrees.

Happy trails,

&gt; I've heard that painting the tin black helps to keep the heat down.  It
&gt; might seem petty, but the black paint that I used is matte black and I
&gt; don't like the finish.	The grey that I have is nice and glossy.
&gt;
&gt; I'm using the rust-o-leum high-temp paint so there isn't much choice 
&gt; as far
&gt; as finish goes.
&gt;
&gt; My question: will there be a noticable difference in temperature if I 
&gt; paint
&gt; my tin grey instead of black on my t4 engine?  I'd rather have it grey
&gt; anyways.. brighten things up a bit.
&gt;
&gt; thanks,
