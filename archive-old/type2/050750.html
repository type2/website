Hi, I've been lurking for 6 mos. saving snippets of the digests for future 
reference and am now ready to start restoring the VW that I've bought.  Am a 
resident of Poteau, OK (SE part near Fort Smith, Ark.)&amp; am a VW newbie but 
lifelong admirer that has always wanted a VW Camper.  I bought a '79 
Westfalia Deluxe that has been driven since '94 back in July for $1200.  
Previous owner said it needed a new transaxle (wouldn't go into 2nd gear) 
and engine was fine (last rebuilt in early 90's).  Van was has had two 
owners and was used extensively in the Sierra's.

I had to complete other projects before I could work on the van and they are 
now done so it's van time.  I cleaned out the rear garage, pushed the van 
in, read chapters 1-4, 7 of Muir, obtained a Bentley, got my stool out and 
looked at the engine and nothing made sense in regard to the engine removal 
instructions.  My ziploc baggies and Sharpie pen are still waiting to be 
used.  I thought I was somewhat smart and could figure some things out, but 
I want to do it right.  Have a patient that has owned some buses and is a 
mechanic to boot so may hire him for a couple of Saturdays with me being the 
sweat equity.  I even thought I would extensively photograph the engine with 
my digital camera &amp; used the photos to put the thing back to together like 
it was.

I will be posting at times to ask for direction but will promise to check 
archives before doing so.  I have enjoyed reading the digests and look 
forward to the day I can drive this yet unnamed (waiting for it to tell me) 
Westie to a gathering.  All advice and offers of assistance appreciated.

Photos of my van can be seen at www_dot_cartogra_dot_com.  My member name is
