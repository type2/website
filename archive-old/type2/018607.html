&gt; Hello,

&gt; I checked the archives and the library to no exact avail.
&gt; the locks (pretty much all) are seized and under the control of some one
&gt; other than me.

I know I read about this on the list. I just searched my own private cache
but can't find it. If I recall correctly the solution lies in finding #1)
the key number [may be in the glovebox], #2) a locksmith and possibly #3)
new lock cylinders.

Before you do any of that, however, make sure you're inserting the key
properly. I kept putting the key in the lock upside down for weeks. Also,
there used to be a nifty graphite compound in a little squeeze bottle that
you could spray into troublesome locks. It worked wonderfully.

If neither of these work, find a good locksmith, you might simply need a new
key.
