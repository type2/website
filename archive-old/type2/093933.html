Subject: Re: [T2] Sparkplugs 1700cc

I found a FLAPS problem with that year.  checked my own store and it 
only gives the 1600 engine.  called another up the street and it also 
only gives the 1600 engine.  went to bosch site and it also only gives 
the 1600 engine.  According to the VW parts list which i cant tell which 
engine is which at the moment it lists w8ac, w7ac and w7cc bosch 
numbers. there were two 1700cc engines and a 1600 engine in that year.  
You have presented me with an interesting start point because spark 
plugs are one of the items to add to my tech site.

&gt; Hey Folks,
&gt;
&gt; What is the correct Bosch sparkplug for a 1700cc?  W8AC or W8ACC?
&gt; What is the tap to use to make the thread of a spark plug hole.  I want 
&gt; to
&gt; clean out my threads.
&gt; When I purchased my '72, two years ago, I ordered a tuneup kit.  It came
&gt; with Plugs, points, rotor etc.  The plugs that can were W8AC.  I did not
&gt; know any better than to assume that these were the right ones.
&gt; Now, replacing these, I got some AC/Delcos from my FLAPS.  These were
&gt; dimensionally different, the threaded part was longer, so I did not use
&gt; them, I instead ordered another tuneup kit from Bus Depot, I figure that
&gt; these guys know.  Well the kit came with W8ACC plugs.  Long, like the AC
&gt; Delcos.  Now I think that my originals were wrong.
&gt; As you can assume, putting these longer plugs in was a test of nerves.
&gt; Basically, I had to retap using the sparkplugs as my tap.  I learned 
&gt; that
&gt; Bosch plugs are better at this than the AC's.  I got 3 in all the way,
&gt; backed them out inspected them and replaced them.  They are fine.  One 
&gt; of
&gt; them did not make it all the way in.  I want to tap them all out.
&gt; Thanks for the help.
