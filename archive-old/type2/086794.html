Subject: Re: [T2] Gas tank pics

Richard,

Looks similar to what was in mine, but yours is still soft looking....mine
was hard as rock.

I found that the &quot;boiling out&quot; at the local radiator shop did a fair job,
but I still used por-15 marine clean for two days on mine.....looked
better and better, but still not what I would call great.

I then used the metal ready and it started looking good enough to put
gasoline in.

I decided *not* to use sealer as I could never get the &quot;bowl&quot; around the
inlet and outlet tubes really really clean....not enough cleaner liquid to
cover it.


Richard, I did find out that lacquer thinner would actually help dissolve
the black stuff and is a lot cheaper than anything else I found.  The only
two problems are how to *not* breathe it and where to put a couple of
gallons of the stuff when you are finished.

I soaked mine for almost 2 weeks in the lacquer thinner for the initial
cleanout.  Every couple of days, rotate it or shake it.

Beware about rolling anything around inside with it though....

It is very explosive!!

The write up is still coming on my whole xperience.

Good luck,dave

&gt; I took these pictures of my rusted out gastank:

&gt; 
&gt; I've managed to get out most of the rust out with a chain rolling around
&gt; inside and some muratic acid and lots of hosing off.
&gt; 
&gt; In the other photos you can see that some of the black sludge that came out
&gt; is actually viscous and runs: I let it sit overnight.  I imagine if there is
&gt; any left it will just run down and block up the tubes at the bottom of the
&gt; tank.
&gt; 
&gt; What's left now is this sludge layer you can see at the bottom.  The acid
&gt; has turned the sludge yellowish from black but it's still hard to scrape.
&gt; I'd appreciate any advice on removing this.
