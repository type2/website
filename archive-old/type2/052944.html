Subject: My mechanic is stumped

Dear Jon,

Oh boy. I had a big mystery like this a year or so after I bought Gus (2L.
AFC fuel injected pancake). Nobody could figure it out. Gus would backfire
and buck and finally lost power to a point where he would barely go 30 mph
in 2nd, 3rd or 4th gear Out of frustration I started poking around in the
engine compartment and found a vacuum hose that was barely touching a
connector it was supposed to be snuggly fastened to. I smooshed the hose (a
smallish 14mm OD fabric covered hose) back on to the plastic &quot;T&quot; connector
which goes to the air cleaner (I'm pretty sure) and Gus fired right up and
zipped around the parking lot.  The mechanic (NOT the redoubtable Dr.
Jimmy-way before Dr. Jimmy) freaked until I showed him the hose I had
reconnected. He said that it was a vacuum hose. I don't know if he was right
but I *always* check that hose when Gus has a loss of power problem and yep,
sure every time that hose is loose (finally put a radiator clamp on it-see
chapter IX entitled  &quot;Huff's Bobby Pin and Duct Tape Mechanical Repair&quot; in
that totally forgettable tome  &quot;Condom Plumbing and other Quick Fixes&quot;)
Check *all* your vacuum connections. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that
that's all that's wrong.

Chris and Gus the &quot;That's okay, Mom, you're not much of a Doc, but you mean
well&quot; Bus
