&gt; 69 double cab DoKa (what it is, not its name)(anyone else know what
&gt; DoKa means?)
Karl:
I figured there were some German speakers out there. I'm interested in
German because : 1. It's my heritage. 2. I have a good friend in
Germany  who is a moderate car nut.(old Corvettes) 3.Learning German
makes it a lot easier to read technical literature about my favorite
subjects.
At http://home.t-online_dot_de/home/t3-auktuell/ (sorry, I have not as yet
figured out how to add links to text) the other day I found the
following DoKa: T3 Bj88 3,21 6-Zylinder Oettinger Attk, Ausstattung:
Serie 140,000km., Motor 50,000km., Getriebe neu v. Oettinger, Preis: VHS
Peter Schumacher, Losheim . I can only assume that VHS stands for Very
High Something. Oh well, to rich for my pocketbook, but a 6-cylinder
Oettinger, that's the engine  they all should have come with. I've never
even been sure they made one!
