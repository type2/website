Subject: Re: diagnosing no brake lights

&gt;hey now,
&gt;
&gt;one of the last things i have to do to get misha the '77 westy roadworthy
&gt;is to get the brake lights working. all other lights work. what's the best
&gt;way to go about diagnosing what's wrong with them?
&gt;
&gt;thanks,
&gt;

My Haynes manual has a section on this.  If you want details eMail me.  But
basically the problem is usually in the sensors  (2 of them on my '71
westy, but other years may have 1 or 3).  These are screwed into the side
of the master cylinder.  They can be checked electrically but a quick check
is to tap them with a wrench while the brakes are on and see if the brake
lights suddenly come on.  If so, replace them, they don't cost much (about
$10 ea.) so you might as well do both at once.  REMEMBER TO BLEED THE BRAKE
SYSTEM AFTERWARDS.
