&gt; Well, this looks like it might be an NLA - BusBoys suggests a boneyard.

&gt; Does anyone happen to have a pic of a heat shield from a type4 bus they could
&gt; send me? I betcha i could fab one of these daddies with a couple pop cans,
&gt; spit and some bailing twine. That's a joke. ;-D

if you find one in any decent shape GRAB IT at almost any price... they
were full of asbestos (or so I'm told) and take a beating, I've been
trying to find one for years....
