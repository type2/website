&gt; Dear Folks:
&gt; An hour ago I (successfully) defended my dissertation based on data from
&gt; this list.  After 7 years, it's now Dr. Henry, thank you.

Congratulations!  In what field is your Ph.D?

&gt; ...Type 2 List is not a &quot;virtual&quot; community, but a
&gt; real place with rules, daily business, and a discernable pattern of behavior
&gt; that can be studied.

Such a nice way of saying &quot;asylum&quot;  :)

&gt; There are a few tweaks to the manuscript (and I'm sure you don9t want to
&gt; read 190 pages anyway) but you can e-mail for the abstract if interested.

Why don't you send the abstract to the webmaster to put on the web site?

George Lyle
