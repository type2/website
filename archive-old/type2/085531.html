The last towing company that moved by bus when it wasn't running did it this
way.  It looks weird but they refused to toe is from the front for fear of
ruining the trans.

When I moved by bus to the backyard of my friend's houses to work on it, we
used a full trailer and it was a pain.  We had trouble clearing the ramps
with the front bumper.  Other trailers may have longer ramps.

Here's some pictures:
