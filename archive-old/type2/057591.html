&gt; Where in MA are you located....??
Springfield

&gt;  	It usually helps to tell that kind of info  &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  	Who did the rebuilds on the tranny and engine...??
A professional rebuilder in Greenfield, MA...it was sent to them by Metrix
Auto in Northampton, MA
&gt;
&gt;  	How extensive were the rebuilds...??
there was a crack in the case so it was replaced with one from I believe a
76
beetle (would that make sense?)  they put new seals, new bearings, new rods,
etc.
&gt;
&gt;  	why were they rebuilt...??
&gt;
&gt;  	Realize that you'll probably never recoup all the money you have put
&gt;  into your Bus (and almost never make a profit...)
&gt;
&gt;  	If the Bus is as good as you describe, $3,000- $3,500 is probably a
&gt;  good asking price...
&gt;
&gt;  	My '73 Westy has been appraised for $4500 with the near perfect Westy
&gt;  side tent....  although I would probably let it go for a bit less
&gt;  without the tent...
&gt;
&gt;  	If you need any help selling it, I do have customers that are looking
&gt;  for clean V-dub Campers...
i'd love help...my biggest problem is that i leave in 4 days for CO, and i
have no clue how i'm gong to work out people looking at it
