Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Hubcap?



&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;I must have missed it. Who ended up w/ the hubcap after
&gt; &gt; &gt;EB this year?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I don't know, but I'd be willing to bet it STILL hasn't made it's way
West
&gt; &gt;of
&gt; &gt;the Mississippi and probably never will :(


But it has been west of the Mississippi a few times.  And for some reason it
seems it just keeps coming back.. Y'all keep it for a while this time.  If
we get it back on the east coast soon, I think we should just keep it.
&lt;joke&gt;  :)

Have a great Friday.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
