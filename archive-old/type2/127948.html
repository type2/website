&gt; I bought a faucet from busboys for a mid 80 style westy. They sent
&gt; me one which is black and has 2 wires leading out. I am putting
&gt; together an interior out of a mid 80s bus into a 72. I have the
&gt; wiring figured out to the pump but this faucet has a T and a C
&gt; marked on top. What does this mean. I figured out that when the
&gt; faucet is turned to T only the water inlet on that side on the
&gt; bottom is open if, turned to C then both open. Yes it has 2 water
&gt; lines on the bottom, why is this. Please help. Thanks Dylan 

I bet T is tank &amp; C is city hook up
when turned to tank only the tank will feed the faucet, but when
hooked to city water it will both fill the tank and also provide water
to the faucet.
