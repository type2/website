Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [BSKA] to turn or not to turn... was: good news, 
  bad news

&gt;&gt;&gt; if the lip isnt too bad, then it isnt as big a problem... true
&gt; or not? and at like $100 each, i cant afford to buy new ones...

Are the splined drums _that_ much more than the composite drums?  Wow!

&gt;&gt;&gt;

No 50.00 per drum new for 68-70. still i dont believe in turning them.
It only marginally increases braking and is really more of a planned
obscelecence tool. Break the glaze with a little sanding, run them till
they wear out naturally, dont let the shoes wear to metal and damage the
drums.
Also I dont like semi metallic pads. The organic ones wear faster but dont
abuse the drums as much.
