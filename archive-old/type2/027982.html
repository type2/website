&gt;&gt; I have a crack at the bottom of my water tank, in the threaded area where
&gt;&gt; the pump motor screws in. Is there a type of glue that can be used to seal
&gt;&gt; this crack effectively?. If not, are there any replacement water tanks on
&gt;&gt; the market either original equipment, or otherwise?
&gt;I have had good luck with JB-weld in sealing ABS water tanks.
&gt;Polyethelyne tanks can be welded by a properly equipped RV service place.
&gt;They can also supply replacements in a wide variety of sizes.

I have also had good experiences using 2-part (clear) epoxy in repairing all sorts of auto liquid containers (windshield washer fluid, radiator reservoirs, etc.).  Really holds up under high temp and non-water liquid situations.
