Subject: [T2] '77 Front Wheel Bearing ?

Hello Everyone,
    Well, I'm sorting through the parts I have from the rusted beam I
pulled off and the parts off the replacement beam, picking the best to go
back on. I bought new seals for the inner bearings. Upon inspecting the
bearings from the donor beam, I found them slightly rusty, but the ones off
the original beam are OK. Once I got the old seals out, I found a circular
spring, and this is what I'm hung up on. I've looked in Bentley and Haynes
and I can't find this spring shown or mentioned anywhere. It's between the
seal and the inner bearing. When putting things back together, does it just
fit in between the two? Can anyone shed any light on this, please?    Jeff
S.
