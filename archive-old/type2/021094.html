1356 lbs is too low.  No wonder you return them for separations
(scary).  I've used Sears Roadhandlers for most of the life of my Westy
(223,000 mi now) (used 205 and 195 series, latter mostly)-and never had
a tire failure blowout.....and I use passenger tires rated to around
1450 lbs- look at the inflation capacity of your tires- most inflate
their rear tires too high, in the Westy I get even wear at 32 lbs, but
you should have a tire rated to 40lbs or better- 40 was the STOCK
designation of the original tires for the bus.  BTW, the one failure I
had last year was a brand new looking tire from a 74 Westy spare tire
well that completely peeled off its tread after about 3 hours on it!

&gt; I'm using Michlin 185-R 14&quot; Tires, sidewall also says 91T M7S which means
&gt; nothing to me. Max load 1356 LBS Per tire.
&gt; They give me 70 MPH at 2,900 RPM, 80 MPH at 3,100 RPM and the speedo is
&gt; right on as far as accuracy goes.
&gt; I've been getting them from Discount Trire Co. and they last about 35,000
&gt; Miles before they begin to separate. It's easy to tell when separation
&gt; starts, you start hearing the tires, they get louder. At this point I go
&gt; in for a free rotation and balance and the employee that's doing the
&gt; rotation reports the failing tire and I get a new set or at least two.
&gt; The fact that I camp in some very rough terrain and drive very rocky
&gt; roads to get there is what causes the separation to occur prematurely.
&gt; 
&gt; Discount tire warrantys a set for me every year for about $40.00 for all
&gt; four, I only purchased the one set about seven years ago. I don't believe
&gt; that I want to go to a heavier tire (more plys). They normally have to
&gt; order the tires because they aren't a popular item.
&gt; 
&gt; I've found the right size for me and the warranty has always provided me
&gt; with new tires at least once every 18 months. So I'm a happy camper.
&gt; 
&gt; I get from 17-20 MPG depending on the wind factors onthe highway. I
&gt; normally slow down when going into a headwind and let everybody pass just
&gt; like they always do anyway. I'm not going to blow a motor to get to the
&gt; lake ten minutes sooner.
