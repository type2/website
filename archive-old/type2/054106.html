Hey all, my name is Brian, and this is my first post. I have been into
VW's for over half my life, (about 15 years), and I am currently working
at The Bus Depot in PA. Next week Dana and I are lucky enough to go on
vacation, we are heading out to Deer Creek IN, to spend 3 days with
Phish, and after Deer Creek, we will be heading back through Columbus
OH, to catch a couple more shows. We drive a 68 baby blue Westy, and we
love her to death, she has treated us well for the past 5 years or so.
You see, we have never driven out that way before, but i know from
working at the Depot that we have lots of customers out that way. I
guess the reason for this post is just incase we run into any sorts of
problems, it would be nice to know if there are any vw shops along the
way, or maybe a kind soul from the list who might live out that way,
could give me a yell, it would be very much appreciated. I dont
anticipate any problems, knock on wood, but you never know. I guess i am
mainly worried about the weekend days when the Depot isnt open, Ron is
such a good guy, I am sure he wouldnt mind helping us out weekdays. Well
thanks so much for your time, anyone else headed out to Deer Creek? How
about a caravan? Thanks again, see you on the road..Brian and Dana.
