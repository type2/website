&gt;    I have a 72 bus with a 74 2/1800 twin carb.  After a week with
&gt;  no exhaust, I replaced it. Now I have no power, it won't go above
&gt;  30 mph. I checked cap, rotor, plug wires, plugs, points, valve
&gt;  clearance.  When It was running the timing was at 20 deg. atdc.
                                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                             Was this at idle? If so
then that is your problem, should be at about 30 deg max advance at
approx 3200rpm

&gt;  compression check says approx. 35 psi each cylinder. I have not
&gt;  done wet test yet.
&gt;    Any hints on what to do?

First thing you need to do is set the timing right.  If you are lucky that
may fix it.  If not you need to remove the heads and check pistons, heads,
valves etc, for breakage/excessive wear.
