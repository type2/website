Subject: [T2] Fuel Lines - where to get 'em

Ok.

After my bath in tomato juice, I started searching the archives concerning
replacing fuel lines.

After getting 512 responses to replacing the lines on a 1972, I've decided
to replace all of them.

What is the best place to buy the good cloth covered stuff that's the right
side?
