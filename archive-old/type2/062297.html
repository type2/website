&gt; Re: curtains for 76 bus
 Have you seen the price of fabric, wow !(and I thought
&gt; VOA
&gt; prices were high, for what you get(BTW: it takes seven yards)).
&gt; My wife likes to sew (She made me a neat SCA costume) so it worked
&gt; out OK. She said to figure at least three hours for cutting and
&gt; fifteen

Wow is right, nothing against your wife, probably a beautiful woman. 
But three hours to cut and fifteen to sew. Have not made my curtains
yet, but last weekend in one night I sewed new seat covers for the westy
parts(fold down seats, and back facing seat) in one night (I'm only 20).
Also got all the fabric for $1.99 yard at a local store where all fabric
is $1.99 yard. Got 8 yards of greyish vinyal stuff for the seats and 8
yards for the curtains with almost the same kind of material just a
different pattern.  Will be doing the curtains soon and all they look
like is about 22&quot; x 6?&quot; wraped a few time to hide ends and add in space
for rods. Did they change later in the years.

BTW: the store is in Rocky Hill Conn.
