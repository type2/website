Subject: westy panelling damage

!Hola!
I am in the process of repairing the interior of my
1973 westy. It has the original wood panels (with
original german warning stickers). Over the years,
some poor window seals have caused a little water
damage, not enough to replace them, but enough to
drive me bananas! I dont want to replace the original
equipment, so I was wondering if anyone knew of a way
for me to repair them without cutting them up or
patching them. They are all still whole pieces, it's
just minor discoloration that is the problem. I
thought about sanding them a little, but would I be
exposing more grain or some particle or chip material?
What in the world is that stain color? Can I get it?
It's kind of a strange pink/beige... I dont know how
to describe it. If anyone is interested or experienced
enough to help me out, you can see pictures of my
water damage at:

To skip all the pomp and circumstance, go straight to
page six. The fourth picture gives a good view of the
entire panel. Also, the sliding door panel has some
discoloration. Any suggestions are appreciated...
                                Thanks,
                                Paul Deatherage
