Subject: Heat!

Okay Listees,

This is a subject that most care about.

Had my bus for 3 yrs now and never had enough heat to keep the
windsheild clear.

Thought all was well but found broken cables (of course in the middle
where I couldn't visible see it).

Flappers geri-rigged until new cables arrive.  Lots of heat now.

Just wanted to tell someone how dense I am and how happy I am.  No more
frostbite!
