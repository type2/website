Subject: Re: SU's

Aircraft conversions of VW engines sometimes use Bing CV carburators with
manifolds that orient the sidedraft carbs correctly, so it can be done.
the problem is in fabricating the manifolds and fitting the whole works
into the engine bay.  I've often thought of installing dual Mikuni
motorcycle carburators in the same way, but the fabrication hassle has
stopped me.

&gt; I don't think the SU's will work. The stock Solex and all replacements I know are downdraft carbs. Your SU's are side draft carb and will not work if you mount them vertically (piston and dashpot oil). In a sandrail you might have enough room to mount them on the side of the engine, but in any other air-cooled VW application?
&gt; 
&gt; If you have an intake for a 1296 or 1500 Spitfire engine, I'll trade them for a set of rebuild Solex (for European spec 2L) or a set of Baby Webers (off a 914).
