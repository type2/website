&gt; mweasner} &gt; Don't know what to tell you. I take that 1 13/16 and a six-foot water pipe
&gt; mweasner} &gt; and *wail* on stuff. I always win. ;) The air socket looks far beefier than
&gt; mweasner} &gt; its chrome brethren, much thicker walls. I can't imagine why a tool
&gt; mweasner} &gt; designed for sharp bursts of torque would break from sustained pressure
&gt; mweasner} &gt; (although I can imagine a problem the other way around, from being
&gt; mweasner} &gt; brittle).
&gt; 
&gt; Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but, isn't the principle behind an air impact wrench
&gt; that it's vibrating the nut off?  As opposed to delivering huge amounts of torque?

of torque that translate into the vibration add up to a huge amount of 
torque delivered overall. I would be curious to know how that figure
could be calculated though...(ultimate torque?)
