&gt;It seems that around 2500 RPM the missing cylinder kicks in, then
&gt;without change in throttle RPM go up to about 3000.

Ok, what this says to me is you can identify which cylinder is cutting out 
by pulling each plug wire independently. There will be no RPM change on the 
bad cylinder. I would test the HT wires for resistance. Then check that 
plug. Then inspect the dizzy cap for a crack.

Know that if it is a single cylinder dropping out, it has to be spark, 
because each carb feeds two cylinders and if it were a carb issue, two 
cylinders would both have the same problem. If you let it idle for a few 
minutes on 3 cylinders, you should surely be able to see which plug is wet 
from not firing.


&gt;Ignition has been ruled out and my compression readings do not seem to
&gt;indicate major cylinder or valve issues. Here are the readings:
&gt;
&gt;Dry     wet
&gt;160     190
&gt;185     225
&gt;155     200
&gt;180     185

You are very high here. Either the motor was built with a very high 
compression ratio or you have a heavy build up of carbon in the combustion 
chambers. I would sure be looking for any carbon fouling of the plugs. What 
weight of oil have you been using??? How black does the oil get before 
changing???
