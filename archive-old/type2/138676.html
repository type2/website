Subject: RE: [T2] Sans head gaskets

&gt;From: Mark Hineline

&gt;When installed heads (2.0 L engine) without head gaskets, is it (a) 
&gt;advisable to grind the cylinders to the heads with valve grinding paste, 
&gt;and (b) necessary to do so?


Mark I would say with out a doubt it is a &quot;precautionary&quot; necessity. Being 
as meticulas as you are don't stop. Buy the $3 tube of valve grinding 
compound and spend the hour to do it. Even if you use the gaskets, the 
mating surfaces will be more true than before. Then check it off on the &quot;I 
Don't Have to Worry About That&quot; list.
