Subject: RE: [T2] Vanagon resetable trip speedometer

There is an excellent Hoover sermon on drilling holes in glass if you or
someone nearby has them. BW

I installed a Vanagon speedo in my bus a few years ago and had the same
dilemma.  I was able to drill the hole in the glass by getting a special bit
at Home Depot made for the purpose.  There were a couple of chips around the
edges of the hole when I was done, but it's not really noticeable.
