Subject: Re: R&amp;R instrument panel on '70 SC

I need to replace some wires to and from my instrument panel of my '70 SC.
I have the RB manual, but as I have often found with the RB manuals they
tell you to do a step and leave out the actual &quot;how to&quot;! I need to remove
the fresh and hot air control levers on the dash in order to pull out the
instrument panel after removing the four screws in the corners. The RB says
&quot;remove the pins&quot; and they just slide out. Well they don't tell you where
they are or how to get them out! Now I have found them, but can't get them
out with breaking them. Can any one help with this? Thanks.
