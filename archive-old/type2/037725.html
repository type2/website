&gt; &gt;  Slide it smoothly forwards. As the door nears the

&gt; &gt; place your hand against the back of the door just in
&gt; &gt; front of the
&gt; &gt; pivot link and help it home. The intention is just
&gt; &gt; to reduce wear
&gt; &gt; on the link unit.
&gt; &gt;  The door actually latches at the back, so that's

&gt; &gt; close it from.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, this is a better method than simply slamming it
&gt; shut. But...the 'proper' way to close it (at least
&gt; according to my '69s owner's manual) is: &quot;To close,
&gt; press the door handle down (which releases the hook)
&gt; &lt;when the door is fully opened and locked in the open
&gt; position&gt; and push the door forward until it latches.
&gt; Then pull the handle up firmly until the sliding door
&gt; is flush with the rear panel.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; This prevents excessive wear from slamming it shut all
&gt; the time. If your handle won't pull up, open the door
&gt; and lift the inside locking lever so that it's level
&gt; and try again...it should work.

This is great advice if you own a 68-73 Bus, but the 74
up
Bus has a different type of handle. You no longer have
the
ability to lift the handle to suck the back of the door
in.
You are forced to 'slam' it to make it shut. 
  The best thing I can suggest to do it to clean and lube
the door real good. This involves pulling the door off
the
track, cleaning all the rollers and tracks, greasing them
and putting it back together. Then use the Bently and
adjust the door. I have had several of these, with the
proper lube and adjustment they work great. I had a 77
that
was smooth as silk. While you have it off the track be
sure
to look at all the springs, rollers, guides, and track
for
wear, and defects. I have had to replace some of these
parts.
  If you need more help just let me know and I will see
what I can do.
