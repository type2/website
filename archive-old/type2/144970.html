Subject: A very nervous 2.0 fi

Hey all.

I was wondering if you might have some suggestions for
me. I have a 2.0 fi engine that runs good.......but it
really shakes and jerks when i get to a steady speed
sort of likes its missing.....but when i down shift
and give it the gas its fine but does have some
jurking and shaking.....only when i get it passed
about 70 does it really run good on
acceleration........but when i want a steady
speed......it gets nervous and jurks and shakes.....
its like it doesnt get a good gas stream at a steady
speed........
any suggestions?
