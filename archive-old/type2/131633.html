&gt;From: CR &lt;standingbearz_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt;

&gt;does anyone have a lead on a synchronizer for synching up dual carbs... 
&gt;they usually run around 20 bucks from what i have heard at the local flaps 
&gt;stores but ever where i check around my area and beyond says whats that ?
&gt;OMG anyways.... if someone could point me in the right direction....?
&gt;i have also heard of people making them and such but being that i dont have 
&gt;an idea what the heck i am doing i would prefer to have a genuine synch 
&gt;tool so that i can get use to how to use it?
