Subject: Electronic module in distributor

I've installed my electronix module into my distributor and have noticed that the point where the collar goes by the pickup on the module is quite different from where the camlobe would have opened the points. Am I correct in assuming that my distributor is going to be turned a similar amount of the difference to create the same timing? Thanks,
 
Courtney
