Subject: Convertible window frame

I know that these lists are not meant for commercial purposes, but someone was
looking for a rear window frame for an early convertible Beetle and we now
have them available.  These frames fit Oct 1952-Early 1958.  These are
identical to the original metal frames and are ready to install.  They run
$225.00 plus shipping and if you've tried to find an original, you know how
hard they are to find and probably more expensive.  Let me know if anyone is
interested.
