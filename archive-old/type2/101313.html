Subject: aluminum case update deluxe LONG

...


ok, i've been mostly posting to VB cuz you folks are mainly T4 
motors, but a good many of you are running non-stock stuff and your 
input is greatly appreciated...


Dave writ:
&gt;
Craig- Diagnosis requires Details !

and
&gt;Let's start with a list of engine components and a description
&gt;of modifications and tolerances. ( Refer to Ray Heath's sig line:)
Dave \X/

so here is what i put INTO the building of the motor:

aluminum type 1 case #1606: bored for machine-in 88mm P/Cs. 
full-flowed, decked, clearanced for 73mm stroke crank by rimco.
further clearanced internally for C/W and distributor drive  by me.
stock SP 311 101 373A heads bored for said 88s; mild porting, 3-angle 
valve job on stock (35.5x32) valves. about 5k on these heads.
valve springs: scat HD; berg .015 shims underneath
spring retainer: HD chromoly-  bugpack?
stock rocker shaft and rockers, with stock washers/shims. shaft 
shimmed .030 out.
used T1 pushrods checked for length and straightness
P/Cs : Mahle machine-in (thick wall) 88mm.
berg wristpin keepers
69mm C/W VW crank by DPS, +10/10
main bearings: kolbenschmidt, germany
rod bearings: kolbenschmidt, germany
rods: 311B style, bored end for end and balanced by g berg.
cam: schneider 248-54F *see below for cam specs.
cam gear: 0
cam bearings: glyco double-thrust, copper faced
lifters: ensmann (sp?) stock vw solid lifters. i put on an extra 'oil 
groove' as per berg.
NOS german timing gear
used german cam gear
oil pump: 26mm berg fullflow w/ relief; pump decked and blueprinted by berg.
crank pulley: 6 lb berg 'achiever' stock dia.
gland nut: berg alloy-steel nut and washer
flywheel: steel brazilian, 8-doweled and dynamically balanced to 
crank and clutch assem.
new VW pushrod tubes ($38 from local shop :P)
used dizzy driveshaft
teflon-coated stainless-steel AN-8 oil lines
mexican FI doghouse fan housing
'tight-fin' T3 oil cooler

whew! i think that's all!!  plus seals, etc. motor cost me 3x what 
the car did originally :P
the idea is to have a long-lasting motor with a BIT more oomph, both 
for freeway use and mebbee a/c down the road. no life-shortening 
hotrod stuff if possible.

now, below are all the measurements that i had tools to make, 
remembered to do, could find the piece of paper i wrote it on, etc.

measurements jump between IN and MM cuz i am using 2 vw manuals 
(w/out guesswork and the bentley), berg, fisher, wilson, muir, monroe 
AND the vw rags... so if what i was reading used inches, that's what 
i measured.  a '?' means i couldn't find a spec.

crank bearing dia- mm  1  54.72     spec	55
&gt;	     2	54.71		55
&gt;	     3	54.71		55
&gt;	     4	39.74		40
&gt;
&gt;Rod	1	54.74		55
&gt;	2	54.72		55
&gt;	3	54.71		55
&gt;	4	54.72		55
&gt;crank weight - lbs	22.5	?
&gt;
&gt;cam journals - in	0.984	         .9837-.9842
&gt;cam end play - in        0.0025	        .0015-.0051
&gt;crank end play  mm    .10                     .07 - .13
&gt;rod side clearance - in all  0.013       .004-.016
&gt;dizzy drive play - in	  0.04	         .020-.050
&gt;bearing pin stickout     3mm	          ?
&gt;oil pump case flange to   cam	1.6075	   ?
&gt;flange to pump		1.5945	?
&gt;
&gt;pistons
&gt;weight - oz1	18.2
&gt;	 2	18.2
&gt;	 3	18.2
&gt;	 4	18.2
&gt;
&gt;spring height             1.517
&gt;retainer to boss	0.7185
&gt;coil bind		0.855
spring pressure - lbs    valve closed         150          117-135

this appears in my notes... what does it mean??  :  lobe to cam - 
	1.5 mm  (.595 in)  i THINK i mean  my cam lobe to lifter 
distance.
&gt;
&gt;head bore        3.81
&gt;spigot	         3.704
&gt;step	         0.24



&gt;cam lift             .355
duration  at .050    220 int  226 ex

so that's all the numbers i can dig outta the notebook now!

the problem, as you all know - well, those that aren't deathly bored 
by now , is a dastardly  CLACKCLACKCLACK on the right side of the 
engine... not rod knock, not piston slap, not broken ring noise - i 
don't THINK it is the sound of the connecting rod bolts hitting the 
case, as i blueprinted the clearances, but maybe at speed ?
anyways, it is metallic and unpleasant - on the road it is just the 
right frequency to give you a headache.
it SEEMS to be once per valve actuation... i think it would be much 
less distinct if it were every engine rpm. i mean, i'm the guy who 
knows what a washer in the cam gears sounds like (cards in your 
bicycle spokes REALLY fast :) ), and this is slower than that. kinduv 
a TANK TANK TANK.
anyways.

i have
swapped pushrods
swapped individual rockers
swapped rocker assemblies from head to head
took out the pushrods on each cylinder one pair at a time to isolate 
the offending jug
took out the pushrods on each VALVE one at a time to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shimmed stands out to .030
shimmed stands out to .045
replaced the valve springs on #1 with stock
took out the wavy washers on the rocker shafts and used berg shims to 
give less than .005&quot; play on each rocker, screw hitting valvestem 
just to the right of center, rocker in line w/ valve at 1/2 lift
took off the valvecover to watch for pushrod flex
also watched for oil splashing from EACH rocker and rod- this ensures 
that there were no clogs in the lifter oil galleys, resulting in 
starved, ovaled lifter bores or seized lifters
put a magnet-on-a-stick in each lifter and pulled it back and forth. 
NO stickiness or binding. ronnie mentioned that maybe one had broken 
(they are ensemann 2-piece lifters), and while that remains a 
possibilty i saw no broken clips lying in the bores
took out the dizzy and reseated it
berg and i blueprinted the oilpump, so it SHOULDN'T be drive noise
put on a brand new 30/31 from ronnie... nothing to do with the noise, 
but B O Y HO W D E E was it nice to have a solid idle, smooth revving 
and no odd hissing noises from a wornout carb :)

possibilities remain that i can think of:
pushrod flexing even tho i can't see it (fast, you know)
john connally suggested rockers moving around - perhaps a new, boltup 
shaft would help
&gt;
&gt;&gt;  It kind of sounds like the top of the lifter bores needed to be decked and
&gt;  &gt; chamfered like you do for after market high lift cams.

was writ, and mebbee, but the bores were SLIGHTLY chamfered at the 
factory, and i decked the lifters on assembly

today i drove around the block a few times. it runs GREAT, but that 
noise will drive you up a wall
in addition, i now heard a sibilant, whispery rustle, like dry leaves 
( a new note) - hm. exhaust leak OR head leak?
if a HEAD leak, it might mean that the clanking noise is possibly a 
piston kissing the head and driving it off its seat on the cylinders.
but how? i added a .060 barrel spacer to get a 7-ish CR, so there 
should be puhlenty of room in there.
ronnie mentioned maybe a valve kissing the piston, and i need to 
check that next - gonna put the valves at like .12!
next, i'm going to put em at .000 (if the noise doesn't go away at 
.12!) and eliminate valve noise and see what it sounds like

then, if i still haven't found the cause of the noise, i am going to 
EAT my bus, one bolt at a time.

so ther it stands; 6 months and 2K later. i lost my job friday, so 
i'm at a bit of a stopping point as far as 'buy chromoly pushrods and 
empi rockers and see what happens' .

i really do want to find a borescope and look inside to rule out 
internal interferences and piston clearance problems BEFORE i tear it 
down, but if i have to i'll tear it down to look.
i'm convinced it is valvetrain related tho, so any extra avenues of 
exploration are welcomed.
