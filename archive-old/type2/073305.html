X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

Dave said  a lot, including:

&gt;1968  .........    Caveats are a number of 4 month only parts for early
&gt;'68s and wiper arms &gt;that are 1968 only.

Is there a list of these &quot;early 68&quot; only parts?  Also, at which chassis #
is the break(s) ?
I don't think I've run into  any of them in ~10 years of bus maintenance.
