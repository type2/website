I have been told that 15 inch rims were discontinued at the end of the 63
model year, but my 64 has them and always has.  Is it possible that they were
just still using them at the beginning of the 64 model year, and if so would
my speedo read correctly?

The 14&quot; rim was from chassis No. 1 219 511 , also on earlier buses with  M215.

The 64 model year began at chassis No.1 144 283.

So - this is one of the non model year changes.   Along with the pull cab door
handles, the elbow engine lid prop (not spring) the early 64s buildt in 63 has
15&quot; rims.  Thanks for getting me to look it up.

also- if this is a later 64- how are you sure they are the original rims.
(Unless you are the original owner, in which case I beg your pardon)  Perhaps
it is an option tohave different size rims.


Also- a note re other numbers I have quoted 
 If I say *through* Chaassis No. XXXX, it does include the last number. 

 - when I say * to* chassis No.XXXXX-  it does not include that last number. 
  If I quote from a parts list- that is the way they say it
ie - to #xxxx1 has Green , 
then from #xxxx2 has Grey, which I read as saying
 #xxxx1 had the earler version, (green)
then #xxxx2 was the first to have the next version of that part. (grey)

However I dont know how relevant the exact change numbers are, though it is
fun to quote them, as I believe they may well be inaccurate.   I have a bus
that is about 27 or so different in VIN from a change, and has the set up the
way the book says it shouldn't.
