Subject: Re: [T2] vacuum equalizing line?????

Yes, if you want to ventilate your pistons with a nice hole in the center of

Vacuum advance requires ported vacuum, NOT MANIFOLD VACUUM. So you need
modified carbs or throttle bodies for a vacuum advance distributor like an
SVDA. We have them modified and ready to ship at
