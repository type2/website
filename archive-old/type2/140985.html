Subject: Tranny Questions

I have a 71 bus that needs a tranny.  My question is will a 76 tranny fit, if
I change the bell housing?  Is that possible?
Does a 76 tranny have different gearing?

I want higher gearing for the highway.  Should I just buy a freeway flyer
tranny?

Thanks for the help!

Richard
