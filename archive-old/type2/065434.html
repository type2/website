&gt;Well, they didn't re-tool just for that. They also re-tooled for those few
&gt;months to produce a one-year-only wider bay-window body, if I remember
&gt;right. I wonder if there was a single-year wide fiberglas top for the
&gt;single-year wide body? Resto-wise, there might be a whole slew of little
&gt;differences in the body and interior because of those extra inches...that's
&gt;assuming the suspension dimensions weren't changed...

I think the &quot;wider 79 body&quot; is referring to the Vanagon-style body, which
started selling in 79 in other parts of the world.  I haven't noticed 79's
being any wider than any other breadloaves.
