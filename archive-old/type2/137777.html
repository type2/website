Subject: Re: [T2] WR1

Hi Mike,

If you've got that in the engine compartment, it should be real easy
to verify it's operation.

When an assistant turns the key, verify 12v arrives at the relay to
verify ignition function.

Also verify relay operation by running a clip lead directly from the
battery to where the ignition wire activates it to ensure relay
function.

Good luck,

John

 I installed a WR1 kit today.
 
 But, it doesn't seem to help.  I need to get underneath and try to manually
 kick the starter over.
 
 I'm bummed.
 
 I did Richard's trick with installing the relay in the engine compartment.
 Thanks for the idea, Richard.
