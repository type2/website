Subject: [T2] '77 Westy Bad fuel pump?

Got a problem with stalling at idle. I can bypass the contacts in the air
flow meter designed to turn off the fuel pump when the engine is not
running, but, the pump doesn't operate every time I do this. Seems to me
that when the contacts in the air flow meter are closed the pump should run
constantly with the key &quot;on&quot; and the engine off. Am I right or am I wrong,
anyone know?
