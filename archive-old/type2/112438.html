Subject: Re: [T2] Engine urban legends.........

&gt; Your gauge is either inaccurate, of the sender is mounted wrong............
&gt; the time it is taking for warm up is very excessive, and 220 is already near
&gt; the breakdown temp for the oil................my busses never get that hot,
&gt; only on the steepest of grades.

Hmmmm... When I'm running 65mph on the interstate and the ambient temperature
is about 90 degrees, my oil temp gauge reads between 220 and 240. I've been
tool that this is OK - and not to worry until it gets above 260.

Do live somewhere where the air temp never gets about 80?
