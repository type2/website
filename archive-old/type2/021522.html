Subject: My bus runs, with questions.....

Hey.  It's the middle of summer and I FINALLY got my bus put together, 
running, and in the garage.  Woo hoo!!

   Ok so I have two questions.  The first one is:  What is the sensor 
that mounts near the back of the flywheel?  What does it do, and what 
happens when it hits the two little studs it's supposed to sense?

   The second question:  My bus now makes a squeaking sound, all the 
time.  It seems to be coming from the clutch area, but I can't be sure.  
It's got a new clutch, and I took the engine apart and put in lots of 
new seals.  Anyone had this problem before, or know what it is?

   Thanks for the help,
