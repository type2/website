Last year, since my Westy was not drivable and
just sitting in my driveway, I covered it with
Christmas lights, including a lighted snowman
behind the windshield on the drivers side. It was
a big hit with the neighbors, who had previously
done nothing but bitch about me having it on my 
property. However, before anyone covers their bus
with lights and hits the road, check local laws
first. I did this years ago, and drove around for
weeks with no problem, then encountered a cop having
a bad day, and got a ticket.  Jeff
