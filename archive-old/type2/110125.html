Subject: Re: [T2] Need Flex Plate Bolt help

My 74 flex plate has three hex headed bolts.

All of them do---

Any FLAPS shoud be able to accomodate you if you need some new ones--
Just make sure they are grade eight bolts. 

Later,

List, I am removing and tearing down the 1800cc engine in my '74 bus
with automatic transmission. The torque converter is mounted to a flex
plate that 
is bolted to the crank with 6? bolts. I don't remember if these are torx
heads or some kind of star pattern bolt head. I would like to find a
source to obtain the tool to remove these when I get to that point and
also a source 
of replacement bolts should that be necessary. Can anyone help? Thanks! 
Jim
