Subject: Things to do with the engine out.  Was Maggie Progress Report: Day 2

Eric,

I am awfully glad that your problem worked out to be as simple as it is. 
In my entire experience (25 years) of working on cars, I have never seen
one of those &quot;D&quot; keys go.  Fall out, yes; into the damned crankcase (Ford
390 V8), yes; fracture, no. As a result I never thought to mention the
possibility.  The worry in my head is that *something* grabbed your fan
hard enough to shatter that key.  Any idea what? (you should answer this
question, if not for me, then for you)  Also check that the keway is
undamaged and tha tthe fan hub is OK.

*I* was afraid you had spun the distributor drive, for which
you need to split the case (and didn't say anything, as you know how
popular Cassandra was :-).  So I am glad it turned out to be so simple.

As long as it is out (and your CC will still stand a buck or two's worth
of charges) there are three seal areas that are real easy and cheap with
the engine on the ground, and near impossible with the engine in.  All the
seals involved will not cost $10.00, so we are talking cheap here.  The
three are the oil cooler gaskets (2 seals _at_ .75 per, same as 1600 cooler
seals); dipstick bellows (1 bellows, seen 'em for $1.99, seen 'em for $5);
and the filler tube to block gasket (~$1).  The first two require removal
of the fan shroud (which is difficult with the engine in, tho {barely}
possible).  The third is *way* easier if you take off the engine bearer
bar. BTW, this also lets you look at the rear engine mounts.

If you have extra dough (yeah, right! :-), the front main, throwout
bearing and the rear seal on the tranny are the next in order of priority. 
I would advise the throwout bearing, whether it needs it or not (see
clutch disc arguement below)  The seals should at least be checked (is it
wet in there? what does the wet smell like?).  Also, check your end play. 
Tho this is seldom a problem in T4 engines, this *is* the time to correct
it.  If you don't replace the throwout bearing, at least grease it. 

Lastly, (flame suit on) I recommend a new clutch disc.  I know that they
last and last, but JC Whitney sells the disc for $30.00 and I regard it as
cheap insurance against doing another pull any time soon.
