Subject: Re: Bug muffler on '71 bus? Need quick yes/no

Thanks for the heaps of help on this muffler question, all. After all
the hints and suggestions and everything, I think I'm just going to bite
the bullet and buy a stock system - it has the tailpipe to the right,
no? The one thing that confuses me now is that, while ordering a bug
muffler was always easy - muffler, tailpipes, installation kit - the
system for the bus seems has:

a) muffler
b) tailpipe
c) damper pipe
d) installation kits for all of the above
e) tailpipe clamp

I need all of these things? Seems like I should just go ahead and get
the headers and the glasspack, then! Ugh - I hate making decisions! :)
