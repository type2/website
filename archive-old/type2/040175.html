Subject: Re: pushrod tubes

you want to remove the pushrod tubes first.   take out
the pushrods and keep them in order, the slide the
pushrod tubes out, if they won't come out by hand, use
 a pair of pliers (very gently) and slide them out one
at a time, they will come straight out, again keeping
them in order.   you can take a thin towel and put
them over the teeth of the pliers be a bit more
careful so you dont dent the tubes (AMHIK)   the head
should them slide off easily for you.  hope it helps
and makes things easier:)

&gt; VW dudes,
&gt; this may sound silly, but i can't get the cylinder
&gt; heads off the 1.8L
&gt; engine i have.  i removed the 8 nuts and the
&gt; heatexchangers etc. The
&gt; head slides forward off the block slightly, and it
&gt; seems the only thing
&gt; holding the head on is the pushrod tubes. The tubes
&gt; seem to move some
&gt; too, but then stop. what do i do here, i don't want
&gt; to come onto it and
&gt; try pulling the head off and damage something. how
&gt; do I remove the
&gt; pushrod tubes?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks for any input i appreciate it :-)
