Subject: Re: [T2] Firewall Question?

Phil,
	Was just looking at the one in my 72 today and it is pop riveted. 
Aluminum Rivets with a fairly large head 10-13 mm dia. Hope this helps - 
Jeff

&gt; My 72 van never had the firewall above the engine when I purchased it. I

&gt; the cargo area? Are they screwed? Pop Rivet? Welded? etc...
