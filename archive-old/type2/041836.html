Subject: My bus is healed!!!!!!

I just want to thank everyone who gave me suggestions when I told you
that my mechanic was stumped and I was about to cry!  I printed out all
the suggestions and took them to Ed, the stumped VW mech who determined
(drum roll, please) that it was the number 3 cylinder temperature
sensor!  My next quest is to get the air conditioning fixed.  The belt
broke and I need to find out what size belt it needs and how hard it is
to put a new one on.  I am debating trying to get my husband and I to
tackle this, but in reality Mr. Ed will probably get the job.  Thanks
again for being of service.  Beth and the '78 Hippychickmobile.
