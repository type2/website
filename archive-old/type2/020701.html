&gt; I have an exhaust leak between the head and the manifold on Bleu. ('77

&gt; the head. However...  Looking at Bentley, it looks like the gaskets are
&gt; different between the earlier motor/exhaust systems and the '77-'78
&gt; system. The gaskets that I received are the ones shown with the early
&gt; system (Bentley Fig. 5-2) and not the one illustrated for the system
&gt; that I have (Bentley Fig. 5-3).

engines. metal/ composition with one big rectangular hole and a round hole on
each end for the stud to fit 79- 83.
