Subject: alternator problems.

well, with the warmer weather (its above freezeing for the first time in
a month) i decided to replace my alternater with the rebuilt one i
bought a while back. Anyway, im haveing problems getting it out, i have
it completely disconnected except for the plug, which seams to be behind
part of the engine tin attatched to the alternator it self which was
hooked up to the fan shroud and looks like it was suposed to blow air
through it to keep it clean. now my problem is how do i get it off so i
can put the new one back on. There's probably some trick that im
missing....
