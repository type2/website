Subject: Small problem with '77 bus having power issues

I searched through the archive but I couldn't exactly find what I was looking
for.  Lately, I've been noticing my bus having occassional power losses.  This
seemed pretty random to me, until the other day when, after being sluggish to
accelerate in first and second, I filled up the gas tank.  After that she was 
like a rocket!  A friend told me it was probably rust in the bottom of my tank.
This sounds pretty reasonable to me, is a tank flush/seal all I need?  Anyone
know roughly (within $100 or so) how much this costs?

TIA
