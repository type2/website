&lt;&lt; inally made time to work on getting the 57 on the road. It's been sitting
 since 88 when it was driven down to one of the so cal shows and back and
 had been parked for an unknown amount of time prior to 88. You can smell the
 varnish when you open the tank. fuel resevrve switch was completely clogged
 and gummed up to the point that I had to remove it to drain the tank.
