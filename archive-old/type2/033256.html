Subject: Re: of benches and buckets

While not wishing to start a large discussion on this, nor cross our revered 
leader of the mighty list.... but if a bench seat bus is built to stop the 
bus from twisting, what is done differently for our bucket busses to stop the 
twisting?  From Nikki's site, I recall that an Adventure Bus could be a 
walk-thru....

so, where did the strength get added???

curiousity compels me to ask

Dave Russell

'71 Riviera and '73 Sunroof....both walk-thrus... but I wouldn't turn down a 
nice bench seat bus... :-)
