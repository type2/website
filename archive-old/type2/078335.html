Subject: Re: [T2] possible purchase of bus -- first post

I can't speak for the availability of buses in New Mexico, having lived in 
Connecticut and Utah alone, but I imagine it must be pretty good, with the 
dry and warmer climate. That said, I paid $4,200 for a hard top, barely 
campable Westy in Connecticut, where buses in good condition are 
comparatively rare. $4,200 seemed (and still seems) a bit steep to me, but I 
never regretted paying perhaps a little too much for a bus in such good 
condition.

$6k also seems a bit pricey, but if it's in the shape your seller claims it 
is, it may very well be worth that much or even more. In the end what 
matters is how much it's worth to you, not how much I or anybody else on 
here would pay for it. I'll be corny:

A cheap bus might run you $1000, or even less.
A bus in great shape might run you $6000.
Making it across the country without having the engine catch on fire? That's 
priceless.

I drove my $4,200 bus from Connecticut to Utah, and this summer I'm driving 
it back. I don't regret a single penny I've put into it yet. You're far 
better off in the long run paying too much for a great bus than paying too 
little and getting stuck on the side of some lonely highway.
