Greetings All,

I'm the driver of an '82 Vanagon with '83 two-toned blue paint. I'm the
original owner. His speedometer, odometer, and gas gauge don't work, but
that's no big deal. There is a leak in the sunroof, which only hits people
riding in the back seat. The brake lights only work if I step on the brakes
very hard. And as winter draws near, I am hoping the clock will start
running again soon, as it did last year. &lt;g&gt; We are in Kodiak, Alaska, and
have no VW dealer -- and we do have exhorbitant shipping rates. At present I
am most concerned about the exhaust system -- the catalytic converter is on
the floor of the front seat ... I can get a new catalytic converter,
silencer, and tail pipe from NAPA, but I also need a Crossover Pipe (not CA
type) -- which NAPA says is a dealer-only part, and which the dealer in
Anchorage says is obsolete. I'm feeling way overwhelmed here, as I haven't
worked on a car since I looked in my Beetle's engine in 1975 and noticed an
unattatched wire. However, I adore my vanagon and want to continue driving
him. My husband threatened with the idea of a new car!!!!!!!!! (He's got his
own car, doesn't have to drive mine.) Not an option, IMO. So I've bought the
Haynes book and subbed on here, hoping I will be able to learn something
about fiddling with my Van's innards.

My dream is to buy up all of the air-cooled vans and Beetles on the island
... But right now I've only got the one.

Love, Lotus (Flower of the North)
