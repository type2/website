&quot;Drying out a Gauge&quot; :

&lt;&lt; aled gauges imploding at
 high altitude.  Like Al said, &quot;I don't think so, Tim!&quot;  Implosion would
 be more likely if the sealed gauge factory was on a high mountain and
 sold to flatlanders.  Shoulda been EXploded not IMploded. &gt;&gt;

You're right of course.  I should have said 'explode'.  (They usually just
crack.)
