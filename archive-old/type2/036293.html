Subject: Free to good Home &quot;79 &quot; Bus

Hi folks,

I have a 79 bus here in NH that I am going to give away. There is no rot on
this bus, just surface. The frame is pristine, the floors are very good.

It needs a tranny. I will throw in a 1700 carburated engine. Front seats are
gone, floor mat is there as is the back seat. Middle seat gone. Beam is
good, no rust. 
Slider is good, works but needs some parts. All panels are present.
Headliner is like new. Dash is very good with all stock gauges. Nose is
undented and rust free. Missing back bumper.


Can be seen at:

If you have something interesting to trade, that would be cool too, but if
not take it away.
