I've seen a home-made way of locking the engine lid that was pretty
ingenious and simple.  The owner of the bus simply drilled a hole thru the
push button on the rear decklid latch.  Thru this hole he would just place a
regular padlock whenever parking the vehicle in a questionable area.  Simple
yet effective.  Just remember to remove teh lock when you are on your way
again as it'll leave a nice pattern on your paint job if you drive with it on.
