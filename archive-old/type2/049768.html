Subject: [T2] more heat stuff

Sorry, my first question was a two-parter and I got excited and hit the &quot;send&quot; button on mail program before I actually asked the second part.  I've read ALOT about propane heat in the archives section on type2_dot_com.  But no one answered these specific questions: 1) Has anyone actually used a small portable propane heater (coleman style) while DRIVING your bus, 2)Did it HELP in MODERATE cold (30-45 degrees), 3)Are you still alive, or have you died from CO poisoning???
Someone please help a brother out, I don't have the $$ to put out a few hundo on new heat exchangers and ducts, and anyway, it doesn't really get THAT cold in Southwest Ohio...
