Subject: engine for 72

We are ready to buy an engine for our 72 bus, we have a 2.0l that could be 
rebuilt and put back in. We have budgeted $3000 for an engine, we need 
something reliable to travel to and from accross america, now the question is 
build this one, buy a turn key from a reputable builder, or buy a brand new 
something watercooled and convert. Or does anyone run on propane with there 
engine. thanks
