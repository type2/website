Subject: Aftermarket Exhaust

Howdy;
    With the last engine rebuild I popped on  a header and a pair of
glass-packs (they called it a &quot;twin quiet-pack) and it works fine except
for one increasingly annoying trick. No matter how I mount the thing the
bottom clamps eventually vibrate loose and leak. The clamps are still
plenty tight but the asbestos grommets wear out until the bottom
fittings slide freely when I pull on the tailpipes. When I first
installed it I bolted the tabs on the mufflers to straps around the
header pipes. When that worked loose I wondered if the whole twin
muffler assembly was better off being free to wander around so I tried
it loose. When that wore out (after about four weeks) I bolted the tabs
on the ends of the mufflers to right angle brackets attached to the
engine mount crossbeam. Four weeks later. Still no good.
    Any suggestions? At this point I'm weighing three options. One;
throw it all away and buy the damned $150 German stock exhaust. This
would also raise my clearance and I could stop worrying about rapping
the exhaust on the curb everytime I back into a parking space. On the
other hand, I hate to throw away an exhaust that SHOULD by-gawd work.
And to spend the money. And I'm REALLY going to be cranked if I do this
and it still comes loose. Two; Try one more arrangement on the existing
arrangement. Wrap the ends of the heater boxes with a few turns of that
heat-setting exhaust tape, press the exhaust fittings over and torque
the hell out of a pair of American-style U-bolt clamps (either with or
without cutting a split in the exhaust flange). Three, just braze the
sanamabiche on and be done with it. When it comes time to replace the
mufflers I can do so at the flange, and when the heater boxes come off
I'll have to chisel those fittings. Hopefully the exhaust will have
lived a full and happy life by then and I can retire it without angst.
I'm probably going to try two, three and one in that order.
    I welcome any feedback on this...
