Subject: Flywheel end play

Hello all,
    Just got the drive plate off my old block and I'm in the process of
putting it on new longblock. The question I have is there some way to
measure the end play without a dial gauge? I got the motor from AVP and
the paperwork sent with it stated that the flywheel end play had been
set. The new block has the shims in place but I don't have a gauge to
check it. It doesn't seem to have any movement at all. Is it possible to
not have enough play with the shims in place? Seems that with shims in
place and old drive plate that it would be to much play instead not
enough.

Thanks for the help!
