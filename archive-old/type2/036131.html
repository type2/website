Mary Beth and I are taking off in a few minutes to go to Luckenbach for 
the weekend.
Gonna camp at Armadillo Sam's campground ; right next to Luckenbach.

Anyone in the area not doing much this weekend, and wanna take a road 
trip, come on out and say hi.
There is a dance at Luckenbach Saturday night, so it might be fun, as 
it usually is.

Weather is supposed to be great !
