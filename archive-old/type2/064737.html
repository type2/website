Subject: Help Vacuum Leak Checking

After changing over my non-CA FI, vacuum hoses, parts, exhaust stuff, 
etc. I still have a vacuum leak.  I think I can tell I still have a leak by 
watching the idle RPM change.  The NEW $150 Idle stabilizer (for a 
box with one computer chip in it !) didn't solve the problem.

I took it to my local very friendly mechanic who hooked it up to his 
machine which read the exhaust CO levels.  Here is his technique:
Let out a puff of propane into the area of suspected vacuum leak.  
Watch the CO meter, if it jumps, the leak is in the area of the puff.

Worked great, and pointed me to 2 leaky areas, but here's the 
question:

Is there a home mechanic equivalent to this vacuum leak check?
Another vacuum leak technique?
A cheap CO meter?
