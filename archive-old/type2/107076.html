Subject: Re: [T2] longblock first start

&gt; I finally am putting the long block I got from aircooled_dot_net tonite.
&gt; It's all in &amp; ready. I'm going through John's procedure for first
&gt; start &amp; break in. I am turning the engine over w/ spark plugs removed
&gt; and the oil pressure sensor removed trying to get oil throughout the
&gt; engine. How long could it take to produce some oil at the oil pressure
&gt; sensor hole? It seems to have already been a while. Thanks for any
&gt; indication on this. I'm trying to get the thing running for work
&gt; monday.

Jason
you can prime the pump by squiring oil in the sender hole.
when I did it I also turned it over by hand backward.
some engines are assembled dry and this will do it.
