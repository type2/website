          No, but I put a non-EGR muffler on my '81 Vanagon, and drilled a hole
into it and then soldered a copper tube just big enough to fit over the rusted
off end of the old EGR part of the muffler that fits onto the EGR filter, into
the hole. I guess it worked, although I don't think there was any &quot;filter&quot; left
in the filter, and I wasn't about to buy a new one. It didn't last terrifically
long.
         I'm all for clean air, but figure that running a vehicle with a small
engine and not buying a new car (every vehicle made creates a major amount of
pollution just in it's manufacture, probably much more than it ever creates in
burning fuel)  makes up for something like not having an EGR.
