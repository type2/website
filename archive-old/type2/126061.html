&lt;&lt; Something is weird here!

Cheers, dave &gt;&gt;

Pop down to the local plumbing supply house and get a few &quot;smoke bombs&quot;.
Find a stretch of road that doesn't have police or neighbors that will call
them. Wire the smoke bombs under the bus and light 'em up. Drive off with
a buddy in a pursuit car to watch from outside the bus. If you've got some
sort of leak that is allowing the exhaust to enter the bus, it &quot;should&quot; also
carry the smoke with it into the bus...We did this with mine a while back just
to see what the air stream was on a bus...The smoke exited from under the
rear of the bus and went straight up the back...Which is also why you 
shouldn't
drive with the rear window hatch open, BTW... 8-(
