Subject: Gas fill elbows COOL FIND

Here is something wev'e been looking for for years and I stumbled
across the solution.  The '72-'79 uses that formed 45 degree angle
in the fill hose, NLA from the dealer and previous solutions have been
akward (straight reinforced or non-reinforced Gates hose etc.)

So I was looking around a bunch of turbocharger sites as I just picked
up a blower (hmmn) and noticed that 45 elbows are available in 2 1/4&quot;
diameter in Buna-N or Silicone (both wonderful for the application) for
about $10 and $25 respectively.  I ordered a Buna-N one for the '77 to
keep things looking right.  I'll tell how it looks when I get it but I'm sure
it will work fine, legs are about 3&quot; on each side.  Now I'm damn well
hoping I'm remembering it is 2 1/4&quot; as its been about 5 years since I've
replaced one but I'm pretty sure, like 55mm or so as I recall.

Go out and get it folks, this is one about every Bus owner needs, even
if they look good on the outside that elbow is nearly always shot.  Search
for turbocharger on the www and you'll find a score of places selling the
stuff, pick one near you.
