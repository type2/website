Hi, all. 
I just wanted to say I'm sorry for the post I made to the list yesterday. Not
only was it in poor taste (I had a hard time keeping the content within the
limits of an &quot;R&quot; rating), but it wasn't necessary to make all of you read it.
Not only that, there wasn't even the obligatory VW content. I hereby promise
that you won't see anything like that from me again. 
Thanks to Jonathan, No Quarter &amp; Ken for stepping in to calm the frey, and to
all the other list members for putting up with it. 
Again, my most sincere apologies.
