Subject: Re: [T2] Bently CD rom

&gt; Is the info that much different than the Bently manual?
 Ive been looking for that second edition Bently also. I think it had a yellow
 cover. Have any of you guys been able to find it?

I have not seen the CD.
The yellow cover 1st and 2nd edition Type 2 manuals were put out by VW,
NOT Bentley. It appears that Bentley used most but not all the info from the yellow books when they printed
their repair manuals.
Once in a long while the yellow books show up on ebay.
VW also put out an earlier manual that covered 68 to 70.
Richard put pics of all the covers here:

I have the 68-70 manual and the 1st edition yellow cover.
