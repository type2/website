&gt; Does anybody make new ones or rebuild these gas heaters? I have seen them on
&gt; Ebay for $400+ dollars. I cannot afford this kind of dough for something
&gt; used and half worn out. Hate to just by junk. I would pay this price for
&gt; something new or rebuild with warrantee.

the best price I know for new is from Wabasto and it is over $800

truckers use em to keep their cabs warm, but there is only one model that
is gas fired air to air (which is what a bus needs)

&gt; FIX THAT GAS HEATER!!  A gas heater is the BEST way to heat a bus, but  you
&gt; need to rebuild your heater, change the fuel lines and put a new exhaust on
&gt; it.  If you need rebuild parts, go to:
