&gt; i need my digests! where are they? i'm *goingthroughwithdrawal* being
without
&gt; power from hurricane fran is bad enough, but not having my digests is death
&gt; itself! no, worse then death! *sniffle* :-)

Your server went apeshit well before the storm. I thought you had
re-subscribed by now.

I've been getting a lot of mail about this lately. If the list stops
coming, it probably won't start again by itself. There are many goblins
and demons upstream from you that can make your mail bounce unbeknownst
to you, and if your mail bounces you get unsubscribed.

If that happens, simply resubscribe yourself. This does not require
intervention from me or the list. If the problem is on our end. I'll let
you know (promise!) but in the vast majority of cases it isn't.
