Subject: getting crushed (was: Valve adjustments)

&gt; I've read too often about folks getting crushed.

Ain't that the truth! Always prepare for the unexpected. In my case, the
concrete floor gave in under the (stock) jack and the jack sunk into the
ground. Fortunately I had just crawled out from under the bus to pick up the
phone.  

Moral of the story: phone calls can save lives. :)

Moral of the story #2: put a piece of lumber under the jack to spread the
weight.
