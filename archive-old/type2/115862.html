&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I have a 1984 Vanagon (1.9 L water-cooled engine, 4 speed manual) &amp; I
&gt;&gt; plan to tow a 1977 VW Camper (high top) from pasadena to Phoenix. Can I
&gt;&gt; do it with my vanagon?

&gt; If you decide to go through with this folly I
&gt; suggest bringing all of your Christmas tree lights along to give
&gt; those vehicles traveling 90 mph (That's almost everyone, right?) a chance to
&gt; see you.

I might suggest a pair of the new LED lights for the tow vehicle, the
magnetic ones just don't show up well in the sunlight, or very far at night.

Richard and Dawn who were the ones towing have done so many times and use
all the safety measures, but sometimes all the safety in the world won't
help.  They have towed MANY busses with their bus, at least two from my bus
farm in Kansas back to Arizona.
