&gt; Absolutely not true. There is no reason that a vehicle produced today cannot
&gt; have any look the design, engineering and marketing departments want it to
&gt; have. It is a bunch of sheet metal and plastic and the reason it looks the
&gt; way it does is based more on marketing than anything else. It does not cost
&gt; more to produce one &quot;look&quot; versus another, within reason.

To look like a bus, the driver's toes have to be within inches of the
front bumper.  Even the best of sheet metal and plastic cannot change the
laws of physics when it comes to crush zones.

(Well, perhaps a huge radar-controlled airbag disguised as a front-mounted
spare tire might do the trick, but it won't be cheap!)   :)
