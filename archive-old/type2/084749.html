Subject: Clutch Installation Question - Help Needed

I ordered a Sachs clutch assembly last year from a %*+#$% vendor,
but never got around to installing it in NewBus.

I started to install same last Sunday.
Upon opening the box I found the clutch (early style using release levers) 
inside,
but there was NO driven plate included with the shipment, even though I 
paid for same!

I ordered and received a Sachs driven plate from Bus Depot just while ago.
Thank you Bus Depot for the fast work.

BIG TIME QUESTION:

The clutch I am removing is the same as the one I am installing, BUT !

I quickly see that the old clutch, as it sits all bolted up,
has the springs holding the release levers pushed outward,
and the resultant position of the release ring stays loaded AWAY from the 
clutch plate.

It is quite difficult to even push the release ring back towards the clutch 
plate.
It looks as though this is the normal at rest position for the clutch 
components.
I would think the release bearing is what pushes this assembly towards the 
clutch plate during gear changing.
To my mind, this seems correct.

The new clutch from the #&amp;^_at_* vendor that I am installing sits at rest
so that the release levers rest inward up against the clutch plate,
and the release ring also rests inward towards the clutch plate.

If I pull the new assembly components away from the clutch plate, they 
springs back upon my releasing them.

One of the two scenarios must be wrong.

What is correct ???????/

Should the release levers and the release ring sit at rest, AWAY from the 
clutch plate?

Or is the normal resting position for these components to sit at rest 
INWARD against the clutch plate?

I can post pictures, if needed.

HELP !
Please
