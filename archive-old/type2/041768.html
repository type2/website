Subject: Re: Tranny Fluid and losing power

&gt;My next question is about tranny fluid&gt;

I just changed the oil in my 71 tranny, and here's today's lesson:  buy a
pump.  The drain plug is on the bottom of the tranny and requires a 17mm
(I'm pretty sure) allen wrench.  They cost more than they should, but if
that's a problem, you can fake an even more expensive allen insert for your
ratchet wrench by buying a bolt with a 17mm head (across the flats, not the
shaft of the bolt), and putting a nut on it (put two on and tighten them
against each other, squash nut style.  That way they don't work loose.)
tight up against the bolt head and cut/grind the balance of the shaft off.
Then chuck the bolt+nuts in your 17mm socket wrench and use that to extract
the transmission oil plugs.

Back to the pump.  Drive around for a while and let the oil warm up.  Then
pull the bottom plug, drain and replug.  The fill plug is not far behind the
front of the tranny case on the left (driver's) side.    You'll need about
3.5 qts (anybody got it exactly?  I forget), and all you do is keep pumping
it in until it starts to flow out the fill hole.  I tried to rig an air
compressor driven closed container system with a hose into the plug hole,
but it failed.  Apparently they lied to me in physics class, or they never
tried to apply it to 90 wt oil.  Somebody on the list did it, and it sounded
great.  I gave up and bought a $3 pump that fits on a qt bottle of oil.  So
I had to pour my 90wt oil into old engine oil bottles I hadn't disposed of
yet, that that was the worst of it.  Messy job without the pump, piece of
mildly oily cake with it.

BE SURE!  to use GL-4 oil, not GL-5 like I did last time.  Unless you like
to practice.

As far as your power loss:  sounds a lot like before I had my tank cleaned.
Are you sure the filter isn't plugged?

&gt;One more thing.  If everything is going good, like I have a blue spark
&gt;from my coil, good spark from the plugs and there in good shape, new
&gt;spark plug wires, new fuel filter, fuel lines are in good shape, new
&gt;rotor, points and condenser, new carb....how could the bus still be
&gt;losing power??  Just driving along and all of a sudden it shakes a
&gt;couple times and no power??
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
