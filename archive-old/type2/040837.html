Subject: distributor advance in 78 too low?

When tuning up the high milage wonder, I noticed that the total advance
is like 36, when I used to remember it would go over 40- what is not
working- is it the centrifugal weights sticking?  Seems to run OK, but
has less poop on the hills.  What's the fix- squirt WD40 in the thing??
