Subject: Re: [T2] Freaky Electrical Problem on '68 Bus

Hi Brett,

I had a problem with things not working sometimes on my previous bus ('73) - turned out to be that the wire from the ignition switch to the fuse box was loose at the switch end.
The wire was fitted with a metal tag which fits into a small metal ring which is then squashed to make the connection, all I needed to do was to sqash the ring down a bit more to make a good contact.

Good luck

&gt; 
&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; My 68 Bus has been having the worst electrical problems. Right now after
&gt; driving for a few minutes I will suddenly lose all power to the motor,
&gt; lights, radio - everything! It became the most noticeable in the past few
&gt; weeks when I would turn on the directional and the indicator lights would
&gt; not come on and sometimes I would also get the dim generator light but this
&gt; would only last for less than a minute then all would be fine again. More
&gt; recently I would get this same problem but now I would have to shock(?) the
&gt; power back on again by turning the headlights on which simultaniously
&gt; results in a quick loss of power to the engine (would almost stall it out)
&gt; but then this (headlight flashing action) gives me my power back again.
&gt; 
&gt; Right now when I go to start the car it will usually start but then it will
&gt; suddenly lose power and stall as if the battery is dead (very very dim dash
&gt; lights). When this happens I can eventually get it started by just playing
&gt; with the headlight and or ignition switch a few times when it will just
&gt; suddenly come back to life as if there was no problem. If this happens while
&gt; I'm driving I can get the power back by using my light switch shocking
&gt; method. When I get the this problem while I'm still in the driveway I jump
&gt; out and start wiggling all the battery connections and starter wiring
&gt; connections (which all seem very solid and clean) but this never fixes the
&gt; problem like fidling with the light or ignition switch does which leads me
&gt; to believe their is a wiring problem somewhere else. I have even removed,
&gt; cleaned and replaced the large red wires connections going to the light
&gt; switch and fuse box and still no change in this problem.
&gt;  Over the last year I have replaced the battery, starter (bad solenoid), the
&gt; positive battery cable connector, and since this problem has been showing up
&gt; I recently upgraded to a new Bosch (internal regulator) alternator (which
&gt; did not fix the problem or change it in any other way).
&gt; 
&gt; Please help I am completely losing my mind over this.
&gt; 
&gt; Brett
