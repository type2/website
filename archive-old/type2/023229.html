Subject: Re: [T2] reverse lights?
Mime-Version: 1.0

So, do I need to take the rock shield off under the bus, or is this 
something I do on the inside?  The light does work at the selector...just a 
bit dim.

I was just wondering how difficult this is going to be.  It seems like 
every step I take to get it inspected, I end up taking a step back, because 
something else happens.

I just hope this is a no-brainer.

Thanks!
Missy:)




&gt;I'm glad you mentioned you have an automatic, because that changes the
&gt;answer.  First, no, the reverse lights have nothing to do with the hazard
&gt;flasher switch.
&gt;
&gt;On an automatic Bus, the reverse lights are controlled via a switch in the
&gt;base of the shifter on the cab floor.  You may have to get in there and
&gt;take a look.  While you're in there you can get the light that lights up
&gt;the gear selector display at night working :-)
&gt;
&gt;On a manual transmission Bus, the switch is actually screwed into the side
&gt;of the transmission and power comes from the ignition coil.  I'm not sure
&gt;if the automatic version is powered via the coil or not (don't have the
&gt;Bentley handy).
