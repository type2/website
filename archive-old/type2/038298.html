Subject: Re: Sit table. Stay!

&gt;I have the table that hinges from the top on the driver's side.
&gt;I don't believe I've ever noticed a method of securing the bottom
&gt;during transport), so that the table doesn't swing out
&gt;during those 1.5G left hand turns.

There should be a metal bracket (like a miniature grab-handle) about 1.5&quot;
long attached to the wall about 2 inches up from the flour with 2 screws.
There should be a corresponding plastic clip attached to the underside of
the table with 2 screws.  The plastic bracket grabs hold of the metal one in
the same fashion that a sunvisor clips into place.  I don't think there are
any sources for these pieces (although dealers sometimes pull rabbits out of
their hats) so your best bet is probably junk yards.  All the Westys should
have had the same setup from 68 - 73.
