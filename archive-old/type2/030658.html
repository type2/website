Hrmph.

Joel emailed me, telling of a &quot;functional wiring diagram&quot; he found.
showed thge ECU 10 being connected to 88b of the double relay, NOT 88a, as
my diagram showed.

I had just come inside from finding this out myself, when I rea that.

Went back out, started to check some things again, (ie: if I was getting
switched hot at 88b, since I still wasnt at 10...though there was
continuity between 88b and 10..anyhow)

No voltage. Hrm.  check the ground I was using by hooking the meter to the
coil.  12.xx  Ok, ground is ok, go back and check 10 again. Its hot.
whoooooa, says I.

So, stick the AFM back in, hook the harness to the ECU, and crank.
vrr...it starts.  But rattles and knocks like a tossed rod! WTF?

Shut it off before I can determine if it was running off of the
cold start injection, as before, or really running.

Let it sit for a second, check the oil.  *grumblegrumble* Little over a
quart low. *sigh*  Add oil.  Note:  this engine, before today, sounded
fine when running on the cold start injection (it would then dioe....).

Started it back up, and it started.  Seemed to run, but rattled and
knocked. Hmmmm.

Touched the throttle, and it died.  Ok.

Cranked it back up, ran to the back, and it died before I got there.
Fetched helper, he started it, and I started to blip the throttle. BOOM! I
jump out of the engine compartment quickly!

I look inside to find vacuumn lines blown all over the place.  It rattled
and knocked during all this too...

Somehow, I'm thinking pperhaps a collapsed lifter?  It's been sitting a
week or so since I last touched it.  Perhaps longer, since I last ran it.

tried a few more times, and it would either start and die, or, if the
throttle was touched, explode.  Latest time blew the AFM off (not clamped
tight), as well as all the other lines.

any ides????

8sigh*
