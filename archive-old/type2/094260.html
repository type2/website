Subject: Better window cranks

I was looking for a particular window crank a couple months back:

http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/.Pictures/Saved/02%2DRightHandle.jpg

It was the OE crank that came with my bus and they are stronger by design
but the weakpoint is still in the knob. I've found a few in good condition
on ebay from 914 owners but I have been unlucky in my junkyard scouring.

The August issue of HotVWs caught my eye with a BugPack ad for Heavy Duty
Stock Window Cranks:

&quot;Crank it, don't break it! Tired of breaking cheap reproduction window
cranks? Don't throw away another dime! Superior quality factory window
cranks are the only way to go.  Fits late model applications&quot;.

For what all the advertising is worth, these surely must last longer than
the flimsy made in Brazil versions that are sold everywhere.  As depicted in
HotVWs, they are identical to the cranks I prefer.

BugPack 24 catalog (page 2 of New Products):

Item #6004  HD STOCK WINDOW CRANK 68 &amp;L, PR.  Country of origin, Taiwan

I'm not sure what the price is yet because my local deal doesn't have that
catalog.  I wish BugPack would sell direct...
