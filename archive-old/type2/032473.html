Hey folks,
We just wrapped up the Event in Ohio.  Weather kinda sucked until Saturday Afternnon, then it was beautiful!  Despite the weather and canoeing being cancelled due to flooded rivers, we still had 18 buses show up out of 30 expected, so, not too bad!  Anyway, goto this site to see some photos ( I also have some Large and XLarge tshirts left over for $10 each, see photos at web page and email me to buy!) Heres the site  http://www.geocities_dot_com/buses_n_boats




Peace, John Baker
