I am sure you have received many replies by now, but just in case...I had
the identical problem and suffered with it for years, buying new starters,
crawling under the van ('77) on hot dirty lots with the kids screaming, wife
thinking I am nuts to drive a VW, etc.

There is a Bosch relay made just for your problem, costing about $8, that
you can install in about 20 minutes.  I have not had a repeat of that
problem since I installed it, and that is with a starter that had been
giving me problems for several years.

I think I bought it from Bus Depot.

Dan
