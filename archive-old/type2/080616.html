well after following a rational path and eliminating the possibilities  it
was apparently the 4 month old Bosch spark plug that failed
  stuck back in the older one and it ran fine.  of course this has been an
intermittent problem so maybe it is just &quot;un-intermittent&quot; at the moment

well will take it for a drive tommorrow.   also need to make two of those
150 mile runs to Harrisburg area Fri &amp; Sat so we'll see how it works

thanks to the several folks that offered suggestions

&gt; volks
&gt; 
&gt;    just want some imput,  last fri my 78 2L FI started having an
&gt; occasional miss.   very sporatic.   Sat I had to drive about 150 miles and
&gt; in the begining it ran fine, but the longer I drove the more often it
&gt; would miss, this is the cyl not fire kind of miss, thought it might be
&gt; fuel filter, but changed it about 3 months ago..????  on the way back was
&gt; running almost entirely on 3 cyl.
&gt; 
&gt;   snowed and rained yesterday, today very little bit better.  went out and
&gt; determined it was #2 cyl not firing.  switched injector wires with #1
&gt; still #2 missing so not power to injectors.  good spark to the plug.  so
&gt; I'm down to thinking .bad plug(fairly new Boschs) . bad injector
&gt; . valves  
&gt; now with valves I would not expect the intermittent nor the total lack of
&gt; noise.  also it will occasionally fire a few times, then stop again.
&gt; 
&gt; am cold and wet came in. supposed to be better day tommorrow and wed.  I'm
&gt; off tommorrow anyway so my plan of attack I guess
&gt; 
&gt; .  compression test
&gt; .  examine plug while it is out.
&gt; .  swap in another injector.
&gt; .  ???
&gt; 
&gt;   suggestions, comments,?
