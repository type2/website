Subject: hard-core tin trivia

Howdy Volks,

	I'm awaiting delivery of my '70 bus (Friday!).  It's missing a
number of tin bits, but it does have Type III &quot;cool-tins&quot; installed.

	From recent correspondence and searching of the archives, the
consensus is that the cool-tins can do a much better job; however, to get
them to fit correctly, a lot of modification (a la Hoover) of the
associated tin pieces must be done.  I haven't got the workspace, time, and
equipment to do this; I will therefore be replacing them with the stock
deflector plates, and I'll be installing all of the correct stock tinware &amp;
the thermostat assembly.

	I've got just about all of the bits that I need, but I'm missing
the left-hand side piece of tin that sits to the rear of #4, attaching
below the main left cylinder bank cover piece.

	The trivia?  I've got two right-hand-side pieces, but they're
different:  one has a ~1-inch ellipse neatly cut in the outboard end, and
the other is solid.  What's the purpose of the hole?  When was it added or
removed, and why?  The catalogs seem to only picture replacement pieces
with the holes.  From searching through pictures in Bentley and &quot;rebuild&quot;
and &quot;hotrod&quot; books, it looks like this hole exposes some of the head's
cooling fins.

	I could imagine that they let extra air flow out, of course, but
that they do so in order to provide extra flow *past* the exhaust port
region of the head.

	Which style do I *want* on my bus?  For symmetry reasons, I'll use
the rhs piece that matches the left one that I acquire, I suppose...  Any
guesses?

Cheers,
-Greg
