Subject: visual cues of rebuild?

list,
I'm getting ready to buy a 77 parts bus with a 2.0 and an auto trans. Its weathered and the FI looks a bit messed with. The owner (who is a big hot rod camaro drivin' guy) tells me he rebuilt it, but i am in the land of rail buggies (eastern ky.) and almost all busses are raped of eng and trans and then usually crushed or rolled into a creek or 'holler' somewhere. For this reason, i question that this guy rebuilt the engine.
Other than refurbing the FI or installing a carb in-situ to hear it run, what might be some visual cues that this engine has been rebuilt?  Scarred bolt heads?  If it was rebuilt, it didn't run long, cause (he says) the trans is out. Are there any seals vw puts on things that would be missing?
Any input appreciated.
