Matt,

You may want to start here:

These are the timming instructions for 009 BOSCH DISTRIBUTOR......

You need to set the timming at 30 degrees before top dead center *BTDC* with
the 009 distributor.  to accomplish this you must 1.  Connect accurate
tachometer or tach/dwell meter to the engine.  2.  Connect stroboscopic
timming light to cylinder # 1.  3.  Run engine at 3200 rpm.  4.  Loosen the
distributor housing and turn it until the 30 degrees Before Top Dead Center
*BTDC*  mark, illuminated by the timming light, aligns with Top Dead Center
*TDC*.  Tighten the distributor in this position.  5.  The static or
iginition timming recommended by VW may or may not be correct after
performing these steps.  DONT CHANGE IT, full advance has been acheived by
the aforementioned procedure and would be corrupted.

Also, since VW cases are not inscribed with timming marks, I recommend
having a  FLARS determine where those marks should be with a degree wheel,
prior to installation.

Hope this helps.......

&gt; Volks,
&gt;
&gt; I have been tuning up a long neglected 1700cc on a 1972 bus with dual
&gt; webers. I am getting a noise like that listed in the title.
&gt; A brief power surge then Pugh, where it kicks gas back up into the carbs.
&gt; I did just do a valve adjustment, but I cheated and used the paint mark on
&gt; the pulley without verifying TDC. Also, there was no paint mark at 180
&gt; Degrees and I eyeballed it. (So much for DM).
&gt;
&gt; When I bought it, I threw on an 009 to get it running as I was having
&gt; problems with the 050 that was on there. Seems to have little power, so I
&gt; ordered the cap, rotor and points for the 050 and will replace as soon as
&gt; they arrive. I also have the original vacuum advance dizzy, but to place
to
&gt; hook up the vacuum to on the new Webers.
&gt;
&gt; Timing is dead on at 5 degrees ATDC. Also restored and installed an old
&gt; exhaust with heater boxes as the old one fell into rusted pieces when I
took
&gt; it out.
&gt;
&gt; I am leaning towards valves first, distributor next.
&gt;
&gt; I have dumped all the old gas, changed the filter and the gas lines. New
&gt; oil, bosch plugs, coil, oil filter, air filters.
&gt;
&gt; Any thoughts.
&gt;
&gt; Matt
