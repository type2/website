&gt; 1-2 hours max. It helps to have some kind of bearing race driver. Bentley
&gt; has instructions for tightening them up correctly.

Sure can!
You might be able to find a socket in your collection that has the correct
dimensions &lt;close is ok&gt;

To remove the race,, I might add...  you can use a cold chizel or punch...
or big screw driver, look for the notch in the hub that lets you get a good
grip on the race... clean out the grease to find it easier.

To install the new race,, I have used a vice to press it in, using a
matching socket with a slightly smaller dia.  or the old race passed over
the grinder enough to make it slightly smaller....
you can tap them in with a hammer,, or use a press,, or squeeze them in with
a vice..  just go easy when starting so they don't start off crooked.

hope that helps
