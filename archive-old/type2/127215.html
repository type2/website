Subject: engine rebuild

The reasons why are it is a convenient time to do
it...plus ive had it out driving after it setting for
god knows HOW long.......and it has no power....so i
though the rings might be bad. It idles good but has
like i say no power and just wanted to take the
opportunity to get it in shape so when i get it back i
can put it in and the van basically be completely
rebuilt..........if that makes sense
