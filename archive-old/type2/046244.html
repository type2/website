&gt; Hey now that is awesome!  With that kind of technology.  You could have some

&gt; see how long it takes to find them.  :-)

Hams do that too!  It's called &quot;transmitter hunting!&quot;

We don't use APRS for this, though.  That would make it far too easy.  We
use directional antennas to locate a lunchbox sized transmitter.  In our
local &quot;beginner level&quot; hunt, the transmitter is hidden somewhere within
the city limits, so it could be as far as 10 miles from the start point.
The transmitter is usually found within an hour or so.  Lotsa fun!
