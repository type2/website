Subject: starting problem

Hello All!

I'm having a starting problem.  My lights are on on the dash board and
headlights are bright as can be. I just get the click sound.

Alright so now the screwdriver trick which always starts it.  Nope. 

So I do the 3rd gear backwards trick to see if its stuck.  Nope. 

Clean all connections to started/solenoid/battery and tighted
all the bolts back up.  Including the two on the starter that hooks onto the 
body.  TrY to start.  No Go.  Just the click.

So then we jump the battery and still no.  just the click.  So obviously its 
the starter motor. 

OK, so then we push start it and it goes.  Drive it around a little shut it
down.  Try to start it again and it starts.  And its been starting ever
since.  Until it gets moody again.

so what is it??
Just a bad part in the starter motor.  It is only a year old.
Solenoid-would've started with the screwdriver
Battery - wouldv'e started with the jump start.
Switch - Would've started with the screwdriver.

-Is there anything else I can check?
-Is the relay hook up just basically the screwdriver trick?
-Has anyone else had to replace a starter this often?(we've replaced   it 
twice in the last 5 years)

I read in the idiots guide that something(pinion?bushing? needs to be
greased could this be it.  maybe its just sticking?

TIA
