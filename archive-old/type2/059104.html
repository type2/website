My friends, 

We have come to the point called &quot;facing reality&quot;.  I just got my
insurance bill for the next 6 month.  This poor beast has been in the
garage awaiting a front axle transplant for 6 months, and I still have not
gotten around to it.  I probably won't within the next 2-3 weeks.. then it
gets cold and I can't til spring.  I've paid another 6 months of insurance
and have gotten no use from it. 

SO....  It's for sale... first $500 takes it.

Facts:

Runs very well,
Tranny is smooth,
leaks oil like a sieve,
needs front axle,
body has one serious ding (left rear air scoop) and the usual rust,
Westy kit is complete and in pretty good shape.


Comes with:
Good used front axle beam,
Good used sliding door (the one that's on there is pretty rusty)

Located in Springfield, VA

It's a project, guys, but a do-able one. If no one wants it, I'll leave it
in the garage over the winter, do the beam replacement in the Spring and
re-advertise at $1000.

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
