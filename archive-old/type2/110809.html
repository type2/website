Subject: gas smell

 I understand that
&gt;the filler elbow at the top of the filler pipe is a
&gt;bear to get to.

****yes it is a booger thats for sure.
 Has anyone successfully done this?
***********yes i finally got to it but only after lowering the engine 
down a bit to get the gas tank cover over the top of the carb.

 
&gt;Thanks in advance,

no problem at all but fair warning this is a pain in the arse but to 
have a gas smell it would be worth checking all lines for fuel.

i was in a burning bus once and it was the cause of dry rotted lines 
though not from the elbow or filler tube.

good luck.

also how full are you filling the tank.
