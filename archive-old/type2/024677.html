&gt; &gt;     So, here's my question.  Do I drive an automatic, or a standard?
&gt; &gt; I'm scared to take my standard on any hills around here,
&gt; because I don't
&gt; &gt; want to stall it and roll backwards into other cars.
&gt; That's like, my
&gt; &gt; worst fear.
&gt;
&gt; What you do is as follows:
&gt; 1 -	Put on the emergency brake (you MUST have a working
&gt; e-brake though!)
&gt; 2 -	Press the clutch-pedal all the way down with your left foot.
&gt; 3 -	Put the car in first gear.
&gt; 4 -	Rev the engine a little bit with your right foot.
&gt; 5 -	Let the clutch come up until you feel the car wants to move,
&gt; 	if necessary give it a little more gas.
&gt; 6 - 	Use your right hand to ease off the e-brake gently,
&gt; 	hold the car in position with the e-brake if needed.
&gt; 7 -	Now at the same time let the clutch come up completely
&gt; 	release the e-brake completely and give it a little more gas.
&gt;

I agree completely with this.  It's what I was taught in driver training,
and rarely need to use it, but when you do need it, you need it.  My wife
was surprised at me when we first drove in San Francisco with the bus and I
kept doing this (even though the e-brake isn't 100%).  San Francisco easily
has the steepest hills I have ever driven on and being comfortable with this
technique makes driving even a heavy bus a walk in the park.  You don't have
to burn the clutch, over-rev the engine, wet your pants or frantically wave
at the people behind you to back up so you won't hit them.

Just my 2 cents.
