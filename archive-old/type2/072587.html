As long as this thread is being tolerated, may I add another question?

The oil temp of my 1776 was reaching 250 on the interstate so I pulled the
engine and began a rebuild. For the first time in years, I paid special
attention to the cooling flaps. I got all four of mine swinging freely and
began to adjust the thermostat.  The total stroke of the thermostat is set
by the height of the opening in the thermostat bracket and I found this to
be about 9mm.  This 9mm push translates into a swing of the flaps of maybe
25% of their total stroke!

Given this, I followed Bentley and the advice of someone on this list and
set the thermostat/rod/bracket adjustment to give full flap opening with
the unexpanded thermostat held against the top of the bracket. I pulled the
thermostat down to the bottom of the brackett and bolted it in place.

Now I have a situation where the flaps are guaranteed to be fully open when
the thermostat expands, but they are no where near fully closed when the
thermostat is contracted.

I am having trouble reconciling this with the presence of rubber nubs on
the flaps which, it seems, should define the flap stroke when these nibs
hit the housing wall.

Can anyone comment?
