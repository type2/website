Hi ya Harm,    The largest tires I've managed under my '71 are 235R14's.  As
for which is most practical depends on many different factors each having
their advantages and disadvantages.  Wider tires increase comfort and better
traction off road and snow but increase fuel consumption and wear on engine
and CV's.  Narrow tires increase fuel efficiency less wear on engine and CV's
also better steering and breaking control in rain and snow, disadvantages a
little nerdy (IMO) and a bit more bumpy...
