Subject: Heater tube through or over the front beam? 

I was looking under my bus today, attempting to
ensure that all heating components are attached.
I notice that the heater tube is sitting
completely on TOP of the front beam-- and looks
smashed.  Doesn't seem right, as I recall it
going THROUGH the beam.  Which way is right?
