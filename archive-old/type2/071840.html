Subject: WELDING needed (Tennessee local)
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

Had an e-mail from a person about the proper panels used to weld up my bus,
but lost the note.

He was in TN, and did nothing but welding. I would like to speak further with
him and see if he would like a project to work on... if you are him... or know
who he is please send this to him or have him write me.
