&gt; Thanks Bob
&gt;                    That's one thing I thought of doing.  recitculating the
&gt; air.  Since I have no heater boxes use air from inside the bus to blow
&gt; through where the air from the heater boxes go.

I have my heater mounted under the front at the same place the A/C
condenser usually is mounted.  an A/C blower is mounted behind the dash
that blows down to under the bus thru the heater and then into the regular
ducts above the front axle.  the duct runs are short and the heater
actually runs too hot and i have to cycle it off and on, the thermostate
is not working correctly it's on my &quot;to do&quot; list
