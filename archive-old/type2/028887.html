Alan,

It sounds to me like you have picked up a stop plate and bracket the proper
bolts are I believe 45mm long shoulder bolts. The trans. or rear suspension
mount proper is a u-shaped channel that fits into your body and two rubber
cylinders are in between. Look under Rear Axle then Securing parts to find
an illustration of these parts. I hope this helps.

Subject: [T2] Front tranny mount


Could someone enlighten me as to the proper front mounting bracket
for my tranny?  It just doesn't look right.  No rubber buffers, no
beefy carrier plate like the one pictured in Bentley...just a thin
U-shaped bracket held on by two 17mm bolts about an inch and a half
long.  I got a carrier plate from the junk yard, along with the
rubber buffers, but I just couldn't get the pieces to fit.  Also the
bolts were about three inches long.  The picture of the carrier plate
in RMMW catalog shows a flat plate, the one I got from the junk yard
and the one pictured in Bentley is U-shaped.  Can anyone help?
