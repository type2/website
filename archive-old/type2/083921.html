&gt;
&gt;Well, my van finally kicked the bucket.  It's most certainly dead.  Pretty 
&gt;disheartened right now, I put a lot of TLC into her.  Because I'm going 
&gt;between Kentucky &amp; New York multiple times a year I really isn't reasonable 
&gt;to rebuild my 82 air-cooled.
&gt;
&gt;With that in mind, I'm looking for an 86 or 87 wolfsburg, weekender edition 
&gt;that has a bad engine but is in otherwise real good shape.  I want to just 
&gt;drop a new engine in it.  I really need to get on this as soon as possible 
&gt;so if anyone knows anything please let me know.  I'm trying not to spend too 
&gt;much money as I'm planning to get an engine from Boston Bob, which I'm very 
&gt;excited about.  I'd really settle for any weekender package but I'd like to 
&gt;avoid the westys.  I live in Frankfort, KY so if anyone knows something 
&gt;close by that would be fantastic.  Thanks a bunch guys.
