Hi Scott,

Thanks for the quick reply. No, you cannot redrill the front rotors from
5x112 to 5x130 because they're not wide enough for a 130mm circle. (And yes,
I'm interested in 944 stuff, provided it also includes the hubs.)

Can you provide me or the list with more reasons for why adapters scare you?

Thanks,

Sami
