Subject: Bus speakers, the continuing saga

I am not in a hurry on this project, I started brain storming when I bought my bus February 10th, 2006.

Here are the latest pictures

Sub in the bus, not hooked up

I am not sure how photobucket works, but if you want to see all of the pictures leading up to this point email me and I will invite you to see my album if you want to and can't

I bought a 1600 watt 4 channel amp earlier this week that I am planning to put in the closet directly above the second battery I am planning to instal this weekend.  By the way that 1600 is more like 600.

I am going to have custom XO's built with the system installed for as flat of a response curve as possible in about 2 weeks, I need to build custom grills to fit the cat-eyes around the drivers, I have to build mounting brackets, wire everything, I am probably 4-6 weeks from finished now.

Thanks,
James in Portland, Oregon
