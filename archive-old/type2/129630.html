Subject: Re: [T2] West Coast Core

Hello Guys  I just sold a bunch of old stuff to these guys  their check 
cleared but they are riding around the east coast now buying old motors .flywheels, 
cranks ,heads, old trannys, etc.  they dont pay very much for this stuff but 
a lot of it was junk anyway , I would be careful buying from them as they only 
do stuff on e Barf and are out of a suite in  Lancaster Cali.   Later and 
have fun  mark Dearing
