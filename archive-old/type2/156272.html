Subject: Re: [T2] Burned wires

check around starter.. make sure nothing is touching metal or grounded out..
  also check to make sure there are no bare places now in all of your wireing harness.. dont take much to melt a little bit off the wire/s in one or more places to make it ground out again...
  good luck and yes post pics so we can see~!~

  I believe that this is what happened however I did not have to disconnect
the battery to make it stop. It looks like the wire just got really hot.
No other wires seem to be affected, just the one heading to the starter so I
am not so sure that its shorted out since it stopped shorting when I turned
the bus off.

I am still waiting for pictures and hopefully I can provide some later
today.
