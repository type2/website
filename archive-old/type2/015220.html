&gt;Sounds like it's a Calif. 66 to 70 engine that had the STP NOX device 
&gt;put on it back in the early 70's... The tube is installed in the smaller 
&gt;exhaust crossover pipe?

That is correct.  It is on the smaller crossover pipe.

What is the STP NOX device?

THere is also a smaller fitting, like a grease fitting, on the same side,
but I think it is on the portion of the intake that goes into the heads.
Seems like it is on the back side (toward the firewall).
