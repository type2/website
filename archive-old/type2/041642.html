Subject: piston ring placement

hello again,
I ordered a new set of piston rings, the 25$ set.
The oil ring is 3 parts not 1, in the instructions
it says to put the middle part of the oil ring positioned so
that the split is by the piston pin. Then it says
put the top part of the oil ring 1 inch to the right of the
split and the bottom one 1 inch to the left.
That makes one of the rings at the bottom of the piston.
Isn't it bad to have a oil ring set up so that the split
is at the bottom of the piston bore?

In the Muir he says something totally different.
Yes I know he's not always right but its the only book that
talks about what position the rings are supposed to be in.

I am confused, what is the right placement of the rings
so I dont burn oil, and compression isnt lost?
Alex,
77 Riviera
