since i have motor out, i am interested in putting in the missing air
flaps and thermostat.  does anyone have or know where to get a good set
of flaps, rods, springs hardware and all?

When I did this, Ken at theBusCo (in Seattle) had flaps, springs,
everything except the t-stat. I don't see them on his site now, but I
just quickly glanced at it (theBusCo_dot_com). T-stat and custom bracket
are available from aircooled_dot_net. Works great. Both companies are a
pleasure to work with if you haven't yet had the opportunity.

unrelated: thanks Hal for offering to help on my engine/tranny pull
this weekend. Hopefully the weather is dry.
