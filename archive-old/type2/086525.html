&gt; &gt; Fill it to a max of 42psi. Start with less as the odds are it will leak.

&gt; &gt; Chances are the mist valve will be bad. You will know if it leaks from
the
&gt; &gt; top of the steering column.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The valve is NLA. You can get the whole switch which includes the mist
&gt; &gt; valve.

&gt; &gt; It is cool to have a working washer system.
&gt;
&gt; You must mean electric.  My air-powered system never worked well even 10
&gt; years ago.  Now it leaks at the steering column and could use an upgrade.
