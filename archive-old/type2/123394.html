Subject: RE: [T2] Cheap buses (was CHEEP BUSES)

Hi Folks,

Since we're all sharing our Bus stories, I figure I'm into my Bus for about 
$7,000.  That's $2,250 for the Bus, $3,000 for a new Jake Raby T4 engine, 
and probably $2,000 for various replacement parts and tools.  However, 
despite all the expense, my Bus has very little rust, and is mechanically 
sound enough to get me across the country and back.

Sure, it's 25 years old and has a lot of quirks, but how many cars can you 
get for $7,000 that have as much capacity, as much capability, and as much 
&quot;cool&quot; ?  Sure, it's not the Free bus or even the $700 Bus, but it's mine 
and I love it.  I think the best value I got for my money was the knowledge 
and confidence to do all my own work on my own vehicle.  There's something 
to be said for driving something that you have an intimate knowledge of.  If 
anything breaks, you can pull over and fix it on the spot.

BTW, if anybody's looking for a straight, dry 1979 Westy, I'd let mine go 
for $3,000 -- as long as I could find another Bus that's as good...  :-D

Happy Friday!
