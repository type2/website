Subject: Re: [T2] Bad Fuel Pump &amp; bad gas/blocked tank  in one trip??

Hi Mike.

The noise and low pressure are signs of starvation; you probably have  
crud-in-tank syndrome.

Check for a kink or blockage in the fuel return line; if the fuel  
can't get back to the tank then the pressure upstream of the FPR will  
be too high.


Otherwise it should be fine. The inlet and outlet on the tank are the  
same size, so the FPR should be the deciding factor if everything  
else is up to spec.


Happy Trails,

&gt; Now I must ask- the fuel pump I think is for a 4 liter truck- could  
&gt; it be overtaxing the pressure regulator in any way? Are the wide  
&gt; swings and noise due to pump starvation?  Tomorrow we can &quot;flush&quot;  
&gt; the tank (blow air up, drain gas) and see if it runs better.
