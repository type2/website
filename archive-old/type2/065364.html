&gt; The sky was blue and beautiful this morning, so I went out and bought two

&gt; got home it was raining, so I'm waiting until I can find a friendly garage
&gt; ... My original thought had been to just squirt the silicone all around the
&gt; sunroof while it was closed, just to stop the leaks. However, after reading
&gt; the card the silicone was packaged with, I realize that was not an
&gt; exceptionally intelligent idea, and that the way it should be done is to
&gt; open the sunroof and squirt the silicone where the old gasket was. What a
&gt; concept ... I looked at the old gasket -- or what is left of it -- and it
&gt; seems to be an empty (used to have foam?? in it???) piece of fabric on the
&gt; car-part-of-the-opening instead of on the sunroof itself. So, what is it
&gt; exactly I am supposed to do? Any help will be appreciated.

HOLD ON A MINUTE! DID YOU SAY   R  T  V SILICONE?

I would not use that as a gasket sealer on anything related to body work 
or sheetmetal. It causes an oxidation process that  will prematurely rust 
whatever it is applied to. Someone put that around the edge of my front 
wind screen on my 69 t2 andit is rusting through. 

My 2 cents
