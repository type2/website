Subject: ragtop in a 77?

i've been wanting to remove the pop-up from my Riviera and replace it  
with something else.  I found some rag-top kits at this website, but  
was wondering if anyone else has done this?
http://www.streetbeatcustoms_dot_com/slidragtopvw-c.html

At least this site has the instructions so you will know what you are  
getting into.

I really don't want to plunk down over $500.00 just to find out that  
won't work. I like the idea of a ragtop, since I won't have a huge  
sheet of plexi to deal with.  I also have the bus in a lot of  
parades, and this will &quot;let the sun in&quot; while I'm driving 5mph.
