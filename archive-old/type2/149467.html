Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Stranded, Ignition switch won't turn all the way

Mark,that sounds like a winner....  But since I don't have a tap, I would 
drill the holes right through the metal and slip two long, skinny bolts 
through the two holes from the bottom side of the steering wheel, with nuts 
on the top side of the steering wheel &amp;  bolts and the two armed puller.

I wanted a system that I could take with me to the junk yards so I could 
save any decent pre-75 steering wheels I found.  At $10 a pop, that is a 
worthwhile endeavor.  I took a 2lb hammer with me twice, and I was not 
successful.  Since I didn't have to worry about buggering up the threads on 
the steering shaft with junk yard buses, I could have a passerby hammer 
away.  And yes, sometimes they do come off quite easily, but usually by 
someone who is stronger and more determined than I am...

&quot;hey guys  I have seen a bunch of these be a PITA  what we do is drill two
holes opposite from each other and tap them then use a regular crows foot 
puller
with two bolts threaded into the holes you drilled and tapped works very 
well
and doesnt bust the plastic  later and have fun  Mark Dearing&quot;
