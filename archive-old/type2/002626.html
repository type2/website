The rocker arms are the same. The difference is between the pairs. Solids
have springs, hydraulics have flat washers, wave washers, and spacers. See
it in your Bentley, section 5 page 32 figure 10-4 shows solid set-up.
Section 5 page 62 figure 17-8 shows the hyd. set-up.
You also need the steel pushrods.
VW shows different valve springs for hydraulics but I have run solid springs
for over 65000 miles with no problem. If the hydraulic springs are
stiffer....then this would cause faster wear of the lifters and lobes.

&gt; When installing hydraulic Lifters and cam in an engine that previously
&gt; had solid lifters, is it necessary to install different springs or
&gt; rockers? Wondering because of the difference in the rocker assemblies
&gt; between the 76 engine I'm Rebuilding and the 78 That will eventually
&gt; will be my spare.
