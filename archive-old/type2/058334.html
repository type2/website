This is not my bus, nor am I in any way affiliated with the seller.  I
found it on the Net and spoke to the buy (Eric) that knows about it.  I am
a Type I engine guy, not a Type IV so I was not terribly interested, bit it
looks like a decent deal to me.  I am looking for a &quot;beater&quot; bus that looks
like crap but is not holy that I can commute in.  It is owned by a hostel
and was used as their all-purpose vehicle.  They are selling it to buy a
truck.

The web page says $1000 OBO, but he said the highest offer was $1300, so
who knows.

I found it odd that Eric said that he has a 1978 Westy and this bus runs a
lot better than his and looks better...Why would he not buy it???  Maybe I
am too paranoid.

I would like to see someone on the list or otherwise just interested in VWs
get the bus because as I said, it seems like a decent bus.  He did mention
that it needs a main seal.

Let me know if you look at it / buy it...
