Hi all--
I've been trying to do research to figure out  my 1975 camper bus.  I received a complete history of previous owners, etc., it was originally sent from Germany to California in 1975, &amp; was converted to a camper by &quot;Country Home Camper Co.&quot; in Oakland, CA.

I can't find any info on this company in the type 2 archives, &amp; am trying to find a manual on the interior equipment, etc.  The top is like a Riviera &quot;Penthouse&quot; &amp; descriptions seem similar to a  Riviera Plan I or II.  It has the weirdest contraption for the bed in back that sort of accordions out over the folded-down rear bench.  (it's made of plywood with orange vinyl covering it.  I haven't seen this interior (particularly the bed) in any pics on the net that I've found.
  It has a sink &amp; cabinet &amp; icebox behind the driver's seat, no jumpseat or stove or anything else.  I'm trying to figure out how to work the sink/pump etc.  Has anyone heard of this conversion &amp; have any info or maint manual on it? 

Thanks!
