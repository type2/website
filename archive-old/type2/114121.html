Subject: Re: [T2] gas smell for me too

&gt;I have a 79 camper and I have become accustomed to the smell of gas when I 
&gt;turn it off after parking...Muir mentions it but none of the suggestions 
&gt;really apply as I have checked them all...is this normal?

If you have carbs you may smell a slight whiff of gas. It can be the gas 
fumes escaping out of the top of the carb. This is one of the causes of 
smog. Imagine if ALL cars and trucks still had carbs...

However you have fuel injection -or you are supposed to. If you smell fuel 
then you have a leak that needs attention. Either your gas cap or the gas 
tank venting system is open to the atmosphere or you have a fuel leak -- 
that is a hose that has failed. I would start with checking the vent system 
and the fuel neck. My vent system had a couple tiny hoses behind the 
firewall that were rotted away. I also had  a torn fuel neck. Be sure to 
see if the vapor canister behind the passenger side taillight is intact and 
connected.

Fix it or risk a fire.

&gt;P.S.- is the EGR warning light supposed to light up with the others upon 
&gt;start-up? Because mine does not.

I'm not sure. It comes on every ?K miles and needs a reset with a pencil 
behind the driver's side kick panel.

&gt;  P.P.S. - I usually have to start the van about four times to get it 
&gt; actually running without dying. This is my first aircooled VW and a 
&gt; fellow enthusist mentioned that it was normal...I just want to make sure 
&gt; I am not looking at a problem here...I have only had it for about a month 
&gt; so am still trying to learn what it is normal and not...any help or 
&gt; comments would be appreciated

If the bus is new to you then I will ask you to replace ALL of the fuel 
lines this weekend. Total cost less than $50. You can do the work yourself 
with the help of a Bentley manual and this list. $50 is much cheaper than a 
new bus or a stay in the hospital. Notice I said YOU can do the work. save 
some money and learn. By design if a fuel line fails then the gas tank will 
drain out onto the ground. If a fire has occurred the fire will continue 
until the gas is gone. If a fire has not started then there is a good 
chance that a draining gas tank spraying gas on the hot engine will cause one.

Muir's book is fine. Use it for entertainment. Use it to locate things like 
the starter and coil. Use it to gain a basic understanding of how an engine 
works. It is certainly worth reading but the Bentley manual is MUCH more 
important to have. I have both and still enjoy the Muir manual. Muir taught 
me not to be afraid to work on my own vehicle and how to tune a single carb 
just right. For fuel injection though (which your bus came with) I prefer 
the Bentley.

These are good vehicles of reasonable design but they are over 20 years old 
and need some attention.

Buy thee a good fire extinguisher too. It will not put out a BIG gas fire 
but you might be lucky with a small gas fire.

Starting: my bus starts and idles fine the first time. Inspect the cold 
start system, EGR valve for leakage, and vacuum leaks all over including 
the injectors. My bus has leaky vacuum problems, leaky EGR valve, leaky 
fuel system, and non-functional cold start system. Once repaired it would 
start and idle like a Honda... &lt;grin&gt;

If you have carbs good luck. Yes they will require alot of babying 'til the 
engine warms up.

Treat this thing as a non-functional antique and inspect everything!!! If 
it is made of rubber replace it (brakes, engine, glass, steering coupler).

good luck!
