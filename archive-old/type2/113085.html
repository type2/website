Subject: Load range C or D?

I'm looking for advice as I'm having trouble deciding which load range
tire to select.  Will a D load provide much more needed stability in
cross winds compared to a C load range?  Obviously either of the two
will be a good upgrade from my currently inadequately rated tires. The
thing is I'm just a bit concerned that the D load will be too harsh
over the road surface. I don't want to be feeling every crack in the
road during my journeys. I'm looking at the Yokohama Y356 series, And
also about 3/4's of my driving is highway. Any comments welcomed.

PS. Please send your thoughts directly to me and not the list if 
possible. I'd like not to start another tire thread.

Thanks!
