Subject: U-Tube for 76-78 Bus

     Hi folks,
     
     At the best of times when I start the Bus most of the neighbours know 
     about it.  Now that I have problems with the U-tube on the exhaust 
     system, the whole city knows about it.
     
     Does anybody have one of these U-Tubes (it has the triangular flanges) 
     they would like to sell to me.  I am not sure if there is a difference 
     between sides, but this on is on the driver's side .
     
     Thanks
