Subject: Re: [T2] where to start turn signal trouble shoot

HAd the same problems (or similar) in my '71 westy.

It was the grounds connection in the engine compartment
near the tail lights.  If I remember correctly, I had
to cut and re-crimp spade connectors back on and then I
screwed in a new spade assembly (pep-boys should have
that) (both sides).  Fixed the whole darn thing in one
shot!
