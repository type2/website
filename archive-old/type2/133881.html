Subject: 71 Bus for Sale

FOR SALE:  I have a 1971 Westfalia for sale.  Its a one family owned bus 
since it was purchased by my now deceased father.  It was driven from California 
and is a California model, though all the smog devices have been eliminated.  
It was banged and repaired and painted while in my father's care. The bus 
interior and exterior is in good condition.  The interior is origonal with curtains 
and sink.  The motor was rebuilt by Caldwell VW service in Reeds Spring, 
Missourie on 6-1-02 and has about 8K on it.  This is a daily driver.  The only 
drawback is the canopy in the pop up.  My father had it parked in his kids 
driveways (five daughters) and the grandchildren poked thier fingers through it.  I 
will deliver her to you if you are within Kansas, Missouri or Nebraska.  
Maximum radius 100 miles (No charge).
