Subject: Re: Hydraulic lifters and oil pressure

Hi list,
Thanks on advice on bleeding the lifters. We will not do this for now
because of the following.

Update on oil pressure :
6psi at 900 rpm
20 psi at 2500 rpm.
Oil temp 200F
30WT oil.
Oil light comes on at idle after a 3 minute freeway drive at 55mph.

Engine builder gave a spec sheet for the engine reporting 35psi at
2500rpm when they bench tested it.

Either something happened to the oiling system between the instant
engine builder made the measurement and now or the engine builder
pulled the 35psi figure out of a hat. What could that be ?
