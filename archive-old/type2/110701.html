&gt; My local yocal flaps guy told me he had two different Bosch points

&gt; with the least expensive seeing that they are both Bosch points?

there was talk on the list quite a while ago about one particular set
of bosch points that held up very well. The rubbing block didn't seem
to want to break or anything. I believe the way to distinguish this
was the wire was a yellow/brown stripe? This might be the pricy
points. If so, I was advised to get the good ones.
