Subject: Brake Reservoir

Doesn't anyone know what kind of plastic the brake reservoirs are made
of? Mine is cracked and I would like to fix it right. Epoxy doesn't
stick well enough for my liking. If it knew the type of plastic I could
find the proper glue to use.

If that fails does anyone know of a substitute upper reservoir for a
'71?  Could be from most any kind of car. I can go search the self-serve
junk yard for one but if anyone has crossed this bridge a pointing in
the right direction would be helpful.
