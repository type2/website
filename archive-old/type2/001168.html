Hey volks, got a new problem:

Now that I have my timing set nicely and everything is running smooth,
something has to happen.  It's just my luck, I've come to accept that. OK so
I'm crusing along the highway and right as I get to about 62 mph the van
starts &quot;bumping.&quot; That's about as well as I can explain it. It seems like it
is dying then not dying in a matter of 1/2 second. Quickly tapping the
brakes would produce a silmilar effect. There is no pattern and the van
won't go past 62 mph now (It did 70 easy before). My only thought is that
maybe it's not shifting to 4th gear but I don't have a tach so I can't
really tell. It's pretty noisy at 60 mph so I can't hear much of anything
coming from back there. Any ideas? Maybe carb. related?(I have a weber
progessive)

TIA
