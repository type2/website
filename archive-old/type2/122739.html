&gt; I have no reason to suspect anything because once she is warm and 
&gt; moving she
&gt; runs great.

I once had a problem where my '76 w/ stock FI would be very difficult 
to start, but once warm, would run great.  If I did get it started, I 
had to be VERY gentle with the accelerator, otherwise it would die.  If 
I was careful, it would warm up, and then run fine.

The problem went away after I fixed an electrical connection problem (+ 
strap on battery not properly connected at solenoid).  I guess the poor 
connection resulted in weak spark?  Anyway, I would suggest making sure 
all of your electrical connects are tight.
