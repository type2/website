Mt. Shasta Snow Trip Update
Mark the calendars, as the second annual Mt. Shasta Snow Trip is fast appro=
aching!  What's the latest?  Well, for the second year in a row, off-road t=
ravel over 7000 foot Hull Mt. Road will again be impossible- I tried it a w=
eek ago and it's NOT passable=
.  Heavy snows this year have the road covered by as much as 4 feet. Perhap=
s an adventure trip for the Summer but even then, only for the bold as the =
road is radically steep and all dirt.  For the uninitiated, this trip is no=
t entirely relaxed.  The mile=
s we're covering to get to Mt. Shasta by 10:30pm like we did last year invo=
lve  BIG TIME DRIVING!  We're slithering through the mountains in the most =
circuitous manner and doing so requires vigilant effort to keep the speed u=
p.  As much fun as it may be=20=
to putter down a remote back road in first gear trying to count how many co=
ws are actually on your side of the fence, we have to maintain our speed.  =
Adhering to this guideline will prevent us from getting in too late.  The t=
rip demands driving skill. fo=
r hours on end.  Chains.  What about chains?  Assuming we need to use them,=
 here's the deal. Like everything else in your bundle of contingency equipm=
ent and supplies, the snow chains are a possible time burner.  Here's Mad M=
ike's brilliant plan:  Mount=20=
up your snow chains on a second set of wheels and when needed, just jack an=
d switch!  My spin on this is that our fine Transporters have clever spring=
 plates that often are quite close to the tire.  Obtain &quot;pizza cutter&quot; tire=
s for the rears so as to keep=
 the chains from rubbing.  Although still a month away, the snow on Shasta =
pretty much guarantees killer snow boarding and skiing!  Cross country skie=
rs and snow shoers also have it good.  All gear can be rented at The Fifth =
Season in downtown Mt. Shasta=
- walking distance from your motel.  By the way, obtain reservations in adv=
ance for the cheap motels.  Check out Mt. Shasta on the Web and pull down t=
he accommodations lists and numbers there.  I forget the name of the place =
we stayed last year,  but 40=20=
bucks a night is normal and cheaper is available.  Well, that's all for now=
.  Send all questions to me and let me know now if you're going or not. Com=
e on! pack that bus full of lunatics, strap the skis to the rack and let's =
go!  Road trip!   Happy plann=
ing!  Brian. kombisutra_at_hotmail_dot_com

  The second annual Ground Hog Day Snow Trip To Mt. Shasta is leaving Guern=
eville Ca. (west of Santa Rosa) Friday, Feb. 1st at 0400 hours on Ground Ho=
g Day weekend for the long, seriously adventurous trip through Northern Cal=
ifornia's best, deepest and d=
arkest back-wood roads. Caravan with us through the woods on this second an=
nual Mt. Shasta Snow Trip for the best bus adventure you've ever been on! D=
river teams farther north on the route will meet up half way, and those nor=
th of Mt Shasta are called up=
on to organize, plan-out and caravan a route as long, adventurous and deman=
ding as this.  Navigate to: &quot;http://www.sonic_dot_net/~mizamook/Shasta1.htm&quot; fo=
r Gene's awesome recount of last year's adventure.  This trip is not for si=
ssies.  Driver teams with end=
urance, good judgment, mechanical ability and sound machinery will be rewar=
ded with an adventure unlike any ever experienced before.  Ever been to a c=
ommunity where the people outnumber the teeth and banjos outnumber the houn=
d dogs?  Well, as an experien=
ce, we'll be passing through several.  We're going so far out into the Mend=
ocino, Trinity, Six Rivers, and Shasta National Forests that people still c=
arry side arms! Can your excellent bus make the trip? Do you have the mecha=
nical savvy if you break down=
 100 miles deep in the Mendocino National Forest? (If not, don't fear. we d=
o) Were you smart enough to have left your original heat exchangers in plac=
e, knowing that being &quot;cool&quot; is not being cold? Have you ever put snow chai=
ns on because passage over a=20=
road would otherwise be impossible? You may get the chance.  This adventure=
 was born from the incredible trek I made across 100 miles of closed, snowe=
d-in Mendocino mountains two years ago.  The great satisfaction felt with m=
y simple six volt single cab,=
 to both keep me warm and slowly power me up an incredibly remote, darkened=
 mountain pass through snow as deep as 20 inches was something I'll never f=
orget. The single cab was the first vehicle able to get through the pass in=
 weeks.  While I don't have t=
ime to elaborate on specifics right now, Genes website explains much of wha=
t to expect.  The actual route may change slightly, but expect an exhilarat=
ing day-long road trip to Shasta leaving the ranch at 0400 hours on Friday =
(I have unlimited camping spa=
ce) to return the easy way down interstate 5 on Sunday morning.  Snow skiin=
g, boarding, shoeing, hiking, ice fishing, train watching, dancing and drin=
king await the teams in Mt Shasta. Saturday night we'll all cook dinner (mo=
re fresh fish too!) and party=
 at the base of the 14,000' mountain, surrounded by snow, moonlight and sol=
itude just like last year (observe the scene in Gene's video clip in the we=
bsite of five adults dining in distinct comfort in the fine 66 Sundial).  I=
'm mailing to all of you as b=
us drivers to both attend, and, more importantly, spread the word far and w=
ide. If you don't have the time to do it this year, please post this invite=
 and pass it on to someone who will, send this thing around!  Like the surv=
ivalist character of our old=20=
busses, we're going, and NO WEATHER WILL STOP THE TRIP.  Grab that map and =
check it out!  Write me with any questions.  Thanks for helping out and hop=
e to have you and the whole insane team come along!  Contact me at kombisut=
ra_at_hotmail_dot_com for more infor=
mation. Happy planning! Brain.
