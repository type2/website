Jeff,

If you are plannng to strip portions of the Bus to bare metal, seal it
up with an acid etch, zinc chromate primer, first----it will lock down
the bare metal, until your ready to finish prime it----

Vari Prime by Dupont is about the best on the market------

Excellent sealer too, on unknown painted surfaces--- 

Later,


Uncle Earl---

Hi list, 
Made a new VW acquisition this weekend, and plan on starting to work on
it right away. 
=A0=A0As I clean up areas of surface rust, what paint should I use on
these now clean and bare areas. 
=A0=A0I plan on having the whole thing painted at a latter date, so I
will be doing final sanding and 
primering with a high build primer and block sanding then, before taking
it to the local MACO for the 
=A0=A0color coat. Am I correct in thinking that primer alone will not
protect it from rusting till then 
=A0=A0and using a good rattle can enamel will protect? 
Thanks 
Jeff.
