Hi John.

Let me see if I understand your engine rebuilding
technique which resulted in decent hot idle oil
pressure (15 to 20 psi).  You do your best to measure
the case bearing seat wear, and then build out to the
case seat with selected bearing sizes.  All of this
probably doesn't end up quite as bad as it sounds,
because it is mostly the main bearing seat that's a
little large due to wear.  It does of course require
putting the case together and taking it apart a few
times to thoroughly identify wear.  Is that about
right?

By the way, I heard from one list member who used
plastigage to meticulously check for proper
clearances, and although he ended up getting quite a
few miles out of his rebuild (over 50K from what I
recall), he still didn't get good hot idle oil
pressure (about the same as mine - 7 psi).  Are there
any other pointers you can think of?  It almost sounds
to me like a rebuilder shouldn't be afraid to get
these bearings fairly snug.  Since there would be more
initial (and dramatic) risk in getting the bearings
too snug versus a little sloppy, i can see why the
average re builder goes for sloppy.
