&gt; The part I don't get is where they get the ground to complete the

&gt; distributor as a ground?  I never really looked at my unit when I  
&gt; installed it so I'm curious if it's grounding through the

Yes. The plastic modules are usually mounted on a metal plate which  
is defacto grounded to the engine through the distributor's advance  
plate and that braided wire inside.
