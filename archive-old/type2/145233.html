Subject: Clutch Cable Problem

So, underneath my '70 Transporter II is this little bit of conduit
that the clutch cable comes out of.  The cable has sawed its way
through the conduit and is starting in on the axel.  Right now I've
got a hose clamp in the way to stop the sawing into the axel.  With
the hose clamp in place I can start the van but 1st gear has little
to no traction.  Without the hose clamp I can't get the engine to
turn over.

Any ideas on how to fix this for under $25.00?

Best of Holiday Greetings to You &amp; Yours,

~JD McLeod
