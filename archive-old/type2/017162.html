Sounds like a vacuum leak.  You didn't say what kind of engine, but
check all the intake manifold and/or tubing for holes.

Good luck

&gt; I found a motor that had not been running for a while.  Cleaned the carb,
&gt; filed and gapped points, changed dist. cap and rotor, plugs, wires and
&gt; adjusted the valves.  When I installed it I got it to run by choking
&gt; it(by putting my hand over the carb).  It ran for a few seconds, say...
&gt; 5-10 secs. and died.
&gt; Even if I try to accelerate it it dies.
&gt; But if when it's going to die, I choke it again... it will run for
&gt; another 5-10 seconds and dies.  In conclusion the only way I can get it
&gt; to try to run is by choking it over and over.
&gt; I checked that the fuel pump is pumping... which it is.
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas on what I might check?
&gt; Could the coil do this?
&gt; Any help is greatly appreciated,
&gt;
&gt; Thank You,
