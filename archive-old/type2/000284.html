I recently stumbled upon a number of large and small posters which advertise
the launch of the 'new' VW beetle _at_ the London motor show 1960.
They are all different and in colour as well as black and white. They detail
the colours available, as well as the swatches for the interior.
In amongst them I found VERY large arial photos of the Volfsburg motorworks,
for advertising purposes, as well as general VW advertising material.
Also....roughly 100 very small VW pins attached to several cards in die cast
aluminium, with the blue back ground.....and small Bosch spark plug pins.
There are also some other bits and pieces......
Does anyone know anyone who knows anything there is to know about this ?
 ( I think )......and if so can they mail me....unfortunately most are too
large to scan and 'donate' to all of you....unless I'm wrong.
 Look forward to hearing from all you historians out there.
