Subject: Working Fridge

Thanks to all the listess who replied to my recent post about the fridge is 
my Riveria. After getting the fridge fired up last night and driving around 
the block a few times to shake up any clogs that might be in the coils it is 
cooling very well. I just checked it again this morning before I came to 
work and is still going strong. Now everything is working properly and I am 
all prepared for my trip to Algonquin Park this weekend.

On a different note I also think that having a name tag of some sort for 
list members is a good idea. Once I get around to finally attending some 
meets I would love to meet some of you folks and put a face to a name.



cheers...
Jeff
