A few people have had to cancel their reservation at BBTT and Blue Rocks is not 
refunding the deposit at this late date.  So if anyone out there wants to come, 
let me know by e-mail by tomorrow (Friday, Oct 15) by 10AM and you can take 
over the spot or check with me at Blue Rocks before you register, and send a 
check to the cancelee.  If you want, I can act as intermediate.
