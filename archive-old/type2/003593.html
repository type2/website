Allen,

You can do it!  The systems operating in a 70s era bus are about as simple
as it gets.

Mechanical ability is not the primary factor in choosing to own an old VW,
SANITY is.  You have to be a bit insane.  Slightly anal, compulsive, and
hugely utopian.  Your going to invest hundreds of hours of your time, your
sweat, your blood, and tons of mental energy, into this THING.  Just so you
can drive a slow, cumbersome, and quirky relic of a bygone era.  It's a
passion, and it's a curse.  It's insanity.

If you do decide to join us on the funny farm, major patience and a bit of
tenacity help a great deal.  Twenty year old vehicles are plagued with two
major enemies. The first and most fearsome is four letter RUST, and the
second is the difficulty of locating quality parts on short notice.  That is
why this list is invaluable.

Invest in quality tools as you need them.  A compressor and impact wrench
help a great deal.  So does a welding torch.  But that's for later, when
your really beyond the blue.

Good luck
Fly low, stay cool
