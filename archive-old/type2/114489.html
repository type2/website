Hey Mike,
factory OEM manifolds, SP and DP and end pieces are available through many of
the advertisers in the VW mags. In fact, you can buy manifolds for just about
any configuration desired. I buy new DP center sections and end pieces
regularly, I just look for who has the best prices that month. CB Performance
and several others also sell performance end castings that &quot;they say&quot; give you
better flow.

Hiya George,

&quot;They don't seem to be
replacable and new manifolds don't seem to be in the offing. &quot;

Perhaps I am misreading this (if so, please disregard), but I take this to
mean that new/replacement manifolds for a 1600 dp are not to be had.  On the
contrary I have purchased (from my FLAPS) three piece replacement intake
manifolds.  IMHO, a big improvement over the stock version for a couple of
reasons.  One, the heat riser tubes are two separate pieces which are
inserted into the cast centerpiece carb platform.  When needed, they can be
removed and cleaned much easier than the stock setup.  And the throat in the
centerpiece is somewhat larger than stock.  Claude's Buggies (the originator
of this design) claimed 4 more horsies from this type manifold.  I couldn't
verify that, but I did replace a 34PICT3 on a stock manifold with a 30/31 on
a 3-piece manifold and noticed no drop in performance at all.  The
centerpiece even has a spot for tapping in a large (or small if you want)
vacuum nipple to allow for the brake booster in the 71.

Mike
