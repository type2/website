Subject: RE: [T2] RE: Michelin Agilis 51/61 Tires- Dis-Information

Hanook and Nanking make both 185r14 and 195r14, load range D. I got 40,000
out of a pair of Nankings when I had a rear seperate, otherwise there was a
good 20,000 miles left on them. I am going to buy 2 more, use two of the
used ones and the third for a spare. $ my cost was $240.00 OTD for 4,
mounted, balanced and fed and disposal.

ronnie

also I don't know if the rules had changed but to get the Michelin Agilis,
you would have to sign a release, as these tire are made exclusivly for the
Eurovans!

Hey Rick!

Bridgestone makes a 185R14 in a load range D in their 603V product.
Seems like a pretty good tire. It's the only product I know of in a D
load range in either size.

Call me if you have any other questions,
