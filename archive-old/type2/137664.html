Subject: Re: [T2] Front bearing question...Thanks to all who responded

Glad to see you are almost finished with that. It's a task I all too
often procrastinate. Wish I knew about the e-clip. I'm always paranoid
about losing one. Maybe a local fastener shop could match your busted
one, or size from measurement of the speedo cable.

 A big thanks to all who responded to my questions two weeks ago
 concerning my front wheel bearing job. Richard's tips about finding the
 right tools made all the difference during installation of the races.
 Thanks also to John Kolak for his answers.

 My final question. Does anyone know what size e-clip goes on the speedo
 cable to keep it from pulling through the hub. Mine was all bent to crap
 and looked like it was the wrong size anyways. Stupid 30 cent part
 keeping me off the road.

 Thanks
