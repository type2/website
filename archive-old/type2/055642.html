Subject: re: bus headliners

Hi everyone,

From my own experience installing headliners in bugs and buses, I feel
that vinyl headliners are easier to work with.  For one, you can heat it
a little and pull it to stretch out the wrinkles.  The other reason is
that you can clean it way easy.  Cloth headliners tend to get very dirty
during installation.  I find myself always washing my hands every ten
minutes or so cause of the glue used, when installing cloth.  Although
when installed properly, cloth headliners look very nice.  Just do not
let anyone run thier hands along it.  I wish someone would make the
tinted green headliners.  My friend met a guy at the Phoenix show that
has reproduced the plaid material that goes in the middle of the door
panels.  You know the green plaid.  He showed me a sample and it looks
exactly the same. Anyone know where to find him?
