Subject: Camper Queries: Water faucet

Hello, one and all, this is my first post, but I have enjoyed the archives
and library very much over the last few weeks.

I recently purchased a 1979 Westy and am trying to fix the various things
that don't work.  My big goal right now is to get the water flowing into
the sink.  I bought a new faucet because the old one had gotten banged and
bent, and the new faucet came with a new switch too.

Today I worked on getting the new faucet and switch installed.  I verified
that one of the wires coming to the switch has juice.  The only problem I
ran into is that I can't seem to figure out how to reattach one of the
hoses to the new faucet.

As you look at it, the hose on the right is gray and is for city water, and
it has a nice screw-on connection.  The other hose (black) is from the
water pump.  It just pushes on the faucet nipple.  It seems a little too
large to
connect snugly to the faucet.  The old faucet seemed to have some bright
red dried &quot;goo&quot; on it.  Any idea what this is?  Some kind of low-pressure
plumbing sealant?

Would appreciate any suggestions on how to get this hose back on.  Once I
have completed this job, I suspect I will still have no water, and will
have to look at the pump itself--do they go bad often?

Best wishes,

   --Stephen
