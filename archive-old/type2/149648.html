Subject: RE: [T2] mo' heat (an additional question from Heat and Lack
  of)

If you are just looking for heat while driving, Make sure all your heater 
box pipes and tubing is in tacked and sealed tight. I had no heat in my bus 
before I replaced the heater boxes and pipes. Now I have great heat in the 
bus, While driving. I have a propane furnace connected for when parked, but 
it eats a lot of propane, recommend gas heater for camping.
