&gt; Hello all,
&gt;      This is alot more than I ever planned to ask the
&gt; list but I don't have alot of options.  My families
&gt; Pontiac GrandAm crapped out this morning and the only
&gt; other car we have is my 78 Bay.  Well, its at the shop
&gt; having the fuse panel rewired.  In short, the mechanic
&gt; says he cant figure out 6 wires related to the FI.  I
&gt; bought him the Bentley manual but he still can't
&gt; figure it out.  That or he hasn't taken the time.  I
&gt; am wondering if there is anyone in the
&gt; Asheville/Hickory, North Carolina area that would be
&gt; able to help me.  Maybe with the wires and possibly a
&gt; ride the the mechanics shop in Hudson, NC.  I have run
&gt; out of options and have no way of transportation, so I
&gt; am trying to do anything that I can think of.  You
&gt; have all helped out greatly in the past and I
&gt; appreciate anything that can be offered.
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely
