Subject: Re: [T2] But My Bus Isn't Worth That Much!!

[...]
I have seen a couple of his engines and the work done on them.  
Excellant work.  However we are talking cadillac/lexus/mercedes vs good 
reliable transport.   Many companies make engines in that category as 
well as some others in the price range/quality of the RAT engines.  And 
as is known to this list there is always the &quot;other list&quot; of engine 
builders that are better used for something other than transport.  
Personal side here from me is that if i need a basic engine i will buy 
it from a reputable supplier that backs their product.  for high end, 
i'll build my own with the assistance of a local machine shop as i have 
done for years.  Then i only have one idiot builder to cuss out.
just my obnoxious opinion

&gt; If you buy any typical Bus, and put it into good and proper order 
&gt; throughout, it will never be worth what you have in it to anyone else. 
&gt; If Raby is actually putting $3500 worth of time, skill and quality 
&gt; parts in his motors, it's damned well worth it. It just is not the same 
&gt; as an assembly line motor.
