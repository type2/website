X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Hello All,
I received a lot of responce to the aircooled buy and sell list. So, I have
created a new list. Its called Aircooled Swapmeet. I have listed the Address
for the main page below. It will give you the rules and instructions on how
to join. If you have a web page that get good traffic, please add this to
your links. I would like to see this list grow. This is not a forum, just
for buying and selling. So go here for more info.
http://www.egroups_dot_com/group/aircooledswapmeet &lt;/group/aircooledswapmeet&gt;
I hope to see you there.
