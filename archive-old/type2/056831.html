One of the best tin, big part degreasers I have found is PEP BOYS white
sidewall cleaner.  It not only dissolves grease, it also will take off paint
if kept moist and left on for awhile.  Use gloves.  It also takes all the oil
out of your skin and your hands will peel if you leave it on very long.  Take
precautions with all chemicals.  The stuff is relatively inexpensive and works
well.  Let it sit for awhile and iff iff the grease is really caked on, brush
it and put on more sidewall cleaner.  Do not let it sit on aluminum for a
loooong time.  A little while doesn't hurt but long exposure will pit the
metal.
