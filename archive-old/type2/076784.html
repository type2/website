Subject: Re: [T2] 009 distributor? Why not?

why didn't VW use it when they sold your van new? The 009 existed then,
right?

The 009 is about 1/2 the cost to make as the stock unit. Why didn't they?

&gt; Mmmm,the usual argument.
&gt; I just had my 2.0litre engine fully rebuilt and had a
&gt; 009 put on it.
&gt; The only problem that I experienced was because of the
&gt; heat build-up on the black rotor button and a quick
&gt; change to a red rotor button stopped this problem.
&gt; I've read all sorts of reasons why you shouldn't put a
&gt; 009 on your bus, even on a 1600 based engine and to
&gt; tell the truth I don't notice the difference.
&gt; Has ANYBODY got a good reason why I shoudln't have it
&gt; there?
&gt; Cheers

&gt; &gt; I've checked the archives on this (try typing in
&gt; &gt; 009, NOTHING comes
&gt; &gt; up). They didn't answer my question. I've been on
&gt; &gt; this list long
&gt; &gt; enough to HEAR that you shouldn't put them on a BUS
&gt; &gt; because the power
&gt; &gt; curve (or something like that) is all wrong, but I
&gt; &gt; have never seen
&gt; &gt; any tests and data on it. Can anyone point me in
&gt; &gt; that direction?
&gt; &gt; The reason I'm asking is because last night I was
&gt; &gt; leafing through a
&gt; &gt; popular VW magazine and saw a 009 on a single cab
&gt; &gt; pickup. I thought
&gt; &gt; to myself &quot;If someone were to spend all that time
&gt; &gt; and money restoring
&gt; &gt; that pickup to perfect condition, why would they put
&gt; &gt; that 009 on it?
&gt; &gt; It doesn't enhance the performance. Don't they know
&gt; &gt; that?&quot;
&gt; &gt; Am I missing something here?
