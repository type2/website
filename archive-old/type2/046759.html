&quot;Steve, I live in SLC and just bought a 78 bus.  I've been doing some of my
own work on it and saw you listed on AIRS.  I've been trying to figure out a
problem but with no success.
Whenever I have the clutch pedal all the way out there is a grinding sound.
The sound gets worse when I accelerate or rev the engine.  When I rev the
engine with the clutch in there's no problem.  I'm thinking I need to grease
something but not sure what.  Any suggestions?  Thanks
Adam&quot;
