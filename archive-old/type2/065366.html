Subject: Starting problems: fuel regulator?

I have posted before describing my starting problem.  My '76 2.0 starts 
slowly in 
the morning, but catches after 10 sec or so.  If it has been started 
recently, it starts right up - even if the engine was running for only 3 
sec. A lot of people proposed the fuel pressure.  I have done a number of 
things and tests:

Switched to 10W40 oil.  No change. (It was 20W50!!!)

Vacuum test: my vacuum/fuel pressure guage is cheap one.  But I plugged 
it to the vacuum line near some wierd emissions cleaner or something, and 
got a steady 18 in Hg.  Sounds good!

Heat sensors: I tried number two, the cylinder head temp.  It gave 2000 
ohms instead of 2500.  Bentley says to replace if it is significantly 
higher or lower than 2500.  Is this significant?  It does sound like it 
could cause my problems.

Then I tried sensor I, inside the air flow detector.  I began with 
termninals 36 and 39, which control the fuel pump.  They worked fine.  On 
my model, you can't test the heat sensor alone, you have to test the 
potentiometer.  6 and 9 should be 100 to 300 ohms, and 7 and 8 should be 
80 to 200 ohms.  Both of these gave complete continuity!  My ohmeter 
could be broken, but I tested against a standard at Radio Shack and it is OK.
This sounds like the whole air detector needs replaced, but I am 
reluctant to spend that kind of money until I am sure.  To me, if the 
potentiomenter was shot, would the engine run at all?  Or could that 
explain my problems?  (By the way, a VW certified mechanic once said my 
seal on the air flow detector was blue, but VW always used red.  He 
concluded someone has opened it up and messed with it, which is a no-no)

Finally, I tested my fuel pressure.  I hooked up my cheap fuel pressure 
guage, and had someone start it (cold).  The fuel pressure quickly rose 
to ~9 psi(within 2 sec) and stayed there.  It took 10 sec for the engine 
to catch.  It ran for 5 sec, and then it was shut off.  The fuel pressure 
decreased to 0 within 5 or 10 sec.  It was started again- it started 
right up and ran for a minute.  Fuel pressure went to 9 psi and stayed there.
Could my pressure regulator be broken, and always be releasing too much 
fuel back to the tank?

Conclusions: vacuum OK.  Temp sensor II is nearly OK.  Fuel pump switch 
in the air detector is OK.  Potentiometer (and temp sensor I?) appears to 
be shot.  Fuel pressure is low, but is not correlated with inability to 
start the engine (pressure went to 9 psi both when it had a hard time, 
and when it easily started), and fuel pressure dropped quickly.
The most likely problems are potentiometer/sensor I, and the fuel 
pressure regulator.  But I fail to see how they could make a cold start 
hard, but a second time starting and engine running work just fine.

Any ideas?  I am stumped.
Thanks!
Jess
