Hi all,

Apologies to the majority of the list as this will probably only
be of interest to Australian listees but...

A fellow band member and Kombi nut friend of mine has the following
for sale (the old story - struggling musician trying to pay the bills)

Pair of 44mm Weber Carbs &amp; linkages.Set up for a 2 litre Type 4 eng.
$350Aus ono.

Nothing wrong with them but he needs the money! I'd get them myself
except that I like getting a constant 26mpg (imperial g's that is)
from my '76 2 litre DC.
Still if fuel economy isn't your thing,and performance is, then email
me privately and I'll put you in touch with him...

Steve O.
Blue Mountains NSW Australia.
'92 Transporter WBX
'76 Transporter Double Cab
'68 Beetle
'58 Fairmont M19 Speeder
'00 Transporter 5cyl Double Cab (work truck)
