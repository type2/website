Subject: low rpm _at_ idle / high rpm _at_ idle

Hey all
I'm having an idle problem.
When I start up my bus cold, the idle is too low and the bus almost
wants to cut out.  Even after short trips, she has low idle rpm.
However, after I drive her around most of the day, she will idle really
high if I stop at a light or a store. (~1500-2000+rpm? I don't have a
gauge, but it sounds like that much)
info:
76 westy
FI intact, all the sensors check out, no vacuum leaks I can detect, new
distributor this summer, timing &amp; dwell correct.
I have adjusted the idle air screw to reduce rpm, but then the idle is
too low cold,  readjust, then the idle is too high hot
ideas??
thanks
michael
