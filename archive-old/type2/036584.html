Subject: Re: three point retractable seatbelts?
Content-Disposition: inline

Were retractable seatbelts ever offered on North American type 2s as an option? My '79 Cal spec Westy does not have them. But my '74 German spec Westy has them and I think every T2 (including T2a)  I have parted out in Germany had them.
Maybe they are available through VW with a Euro spec parts number. Personally, I don't put too much trust in any JC Whitney product.

&gt;    Are JC whitney's three point seatbelts still the best bet for new
&gt; three point retractable seatbelts (in a 70 bus)?  Thank you all for you
&gt; input.
