The best tip I got with the wire was to turn the power and the feed ALL the
way down. Also if you can get a piece of brass (like a door hinge) behind
the well and will reduce the splatter. Dont push the tip to the work let out
the wire about an inch. My welding still looks like crap, but it is much
stronger.

Subject: [VB] welding with a MIG


&gt; I own a 110v Century Flux Core Mig Welding machine.  My question is this.
&gt; Has anyone ever welded with BOTH a fluxcore machine, and a gas (ARGON) MIG
&gt; welder? I can't seem to make anything but popcorn welds with my flux core
&gt; machine, and am thinking about buying a real 220v Gas Mig welder.  Is
there
&gt; that big of a difference in the flux core, and the gas? Or is it just my
&gt; welding skills?
&gt;
&gt; Any input would be greatly appreciated!!
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
