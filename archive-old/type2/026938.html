Hello everyone-
I've got a '77 FI Westy w/o electronic ignition--should I change this?  
Second, and more importantly, it won't start after it's been running great 
since it's tune up.  Anyhow, here are the symptoms:  Completed a 400 mile 
round trip runnin smooth as silk, parked it that night, and the next morning 
it just sits there and cranks but no start.  I can smell gas, so I don't 
think it's the injectors.  I checked for spark coming out of the coil into 
the center of the distributor and found I had a small, yellowish-white spark 
that would only spark if it was about 1/8&quot; away from a ground.  Also, my 
coil gets EXTREMELY hot even when I'm only using the radio.  Could my coil 
be shot?  If so, this would be my second coil within probably 1500 miles.  
What would be causing this if it's the problem?  I haven't checked my plugs 
for spark yet as they're new, but I guess that would tell me if my 
coil/condesor was fine, correct?  Any input in the matter would be greatly 
appreciated!

Thanks,
Chet
