Subject: re: Opinions sought - Cooper and Avon tires

Steve,

I've been running the Cooper Discoverer LT tires as snow
tires on my Vanagon for the last two years with great results.
They have a very aggressive tread and good traction in the muck,
ie. I haven't gotten stuck with them yet. 
Consequently tire noise on dry pavement is noticeable.  
Physically they are tall and skinny.  This contributes to a bit of
extra wander on the road when compared to my wider summer
tires.  Although C rated, they do have a bit more sidewall flex
than I would like, but it really hasn't proven to be a problem even when
fully loaded (the bus, not me!  ;-).
They seem to be long wearing and there haven't been any
belt/separation problems.

For their intended use (snow tires), I'd say a pretty damn good tire 
for $70 per.

Oh yea, I *did* have them mounted with the large raised white
lettering facing outward...  =8^O
