Subject: potential VW content! (SSTONES?)

This should be a personal post but I don't remember if SStones tranlated
from German or Spanish.. In either event I NEED the quick assistance of
a translator. A short papragraph or two to a fellow VW nut who wants to buy
a VW from us. I need to descibe particulars of the sale to them.

Anyone who feels adept at translating VW'eze to Spanish, please post me
privatly.

For you curious NON-Spanish translating folk (like me!) I'll keep you
posted!

thanks in advance

Kevin
