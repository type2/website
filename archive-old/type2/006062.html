Subject: [T2] Seals again


&gt;     I have Genuine VW/AUDI packaged outer scrapers and also inner
scrapers.
&gt; My front door seals are imported from Germany and are made by the same
&gt; company that makes the rear hatch seals. I also have molded windshield
seals
&gt; with or with the groove for the trim.
&gt;    I have not ventured into the later 68-79 type 2 bus market as
&gt; availability on a lot of products was questionable and the pre 68 market
has
&gt; kept me quite busy. In the coming month's we will be expanding our product
&gt; lines to cover the 68-79 year range, this in both OE parts and used. I
have
&gt; parted over 25 buses in the last few years working on building up a full
&gt; inventory of late bus used parts.
&gt;    The only problem that I will have is that I do not personally drive any
&gt; 68 or later buses so I have no way to test products except by customer
&gt; feed-back. Now if it was pre 68 We (type2parts_dot_com) have tested virtually
&gt; every product we sell over the last 4 years.
&gt;    Another new item I will have in the next few weeks are the front floor
&gt; mats for 1968-1972 type 2's of which I was involved having made.
