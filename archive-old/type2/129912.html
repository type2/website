You can still get the stock (well, optional :-) locking gas cap from  
the dealer.  I did not too long ago, from Trans Ocean VW in Pasadena  
while I was in SoCal visiting my in-laws for Christmas.  Part number is  
211-201-551-R.  Be prepared, they charge ~$55 for it.  But it's a  
genuine part.

bimmerparts_dot_com also has a Blau (maker of the original) cap for quite a  
bit less (I wish I'd known about this before I bought mine from the  
dealer :-)

-001&amp;category=E&amp;part=Fuel+Tank+Cap

 From the photo, it looks exactly like the one I got from the dealer,  
for less than half the price.

This cap should fit your '78 California no problem.  My bus is a '76  
California, and it fits just fine.
