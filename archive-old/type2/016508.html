&gt; For those who might be interested there is a chat room for VW fans at
&gt; http://www.vwmagazine_dot_com/chat/

&gt; so far I've only run across aircooled folks.  If you get bored or just feel
&gt; the need to chat with others of the VW persuasion you might consider
&gt; dropping by.  Not many bus folks yet but you could change that.
&gt; 

Uh, you're kidding, right?

I dropped in and came across the biggest shmucks ever to type &quot;vw&quot;. This
is ten times worse than even the watercooled channel on efnet.

Come over to #vw on irc.efnet_dot_net ... there's aircooled people there
that actually drive their busses rather than chopping them up and try to
be bad-assed.

sorry for the ranting... :-)
