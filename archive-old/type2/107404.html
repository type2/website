Subject: RE: [T2] Automatic Choke (was: &quot;Gas in Oil&quot;)

No.  Unless your original fuel injected engine has been downgraded to dual
carbs, then you'd have to ask a carb person.

Hello all,
I was reading a recent thread about one guy's '71 having gas in the oil, and
one responder suggested that maybe his automatic choke was causing the
condition.  Now, I've had gas in the oil before and never have found the
exact cause -- but the automatic choke idea is a new one to me.  I was
curious if this even applies to me -- I have a 79 bus.  Does my late model
even have an automatic choke?
