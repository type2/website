Man, there has got to be a way. What if you took a plate off a bus that you
own here in the states and took it down there, bought a bus and put your
plate on it when nobody was looking? :-) You can tell I have obsessed about
this, eh? Who is going to know? How close does the border patrol check your
vehicle out? I would think that you could get away with it if you were cool
about it. Slip the salesman a 50 spot to look the other way while you screw
that plate on!! ;-)
 I have laid awake nights trying to figure out a way to do this!! But, Alas
I guess we can only dream of doing that...

Scott:
No possible legal way, believe me, many have tried. Beetles are a different
matter, the chassis unbolts, Beetlemex imports chassis with titles and
switch
them in Mexico, thereby bringing back in a vintage, US titled 70's bug with
a
new body and engine.
Type 2's are totally welded, very little likelihood of unwelding the part
with
the number on it and putting it onto a new type 2. They are a LOT more
money,
too, more like $15,000 +.
I'd sure like to get the nose and radiator an heater and put a  water cooled
engine in my 69 double cab.

why
&gt; not the bus?
