Subject: Re: [T2] brazillian cab gaskets

Hi Steve,

My bus is crammed full of Brazilian rubber; door seals, window rubber, air vent seals ... even the tyres are made in Brazil.

So far all of it is holding up well. I live in a city so that includes resistance to air polution.

With particular reference to the cab door seals, they don't leak and there is still (after 3 years) a difference in how card I have to shut the door with or without a window open.

Ask me for 25 year extended report in 22 years time though :-)

Good luck
