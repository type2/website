&gt; No, you shouldn't do that. Amos, I'm sorry, but you cannot rebuild a Type I
&gt; for $300 and have it run for more than a week--much less add dubious
&gt; &quot;performance&quot; mods to drive up the price and shorten the lifespan. I wish
&gt; you could. I wish *I* could. But it's not the case.

i dunno, i think you can get close to that figure but it depends on luck
really...

assuming that:
case needs no machine work
crank needs no machine work
cam and lifters are good
rods are good
(Buy tom wilsons how to rebuild an aircooled engine for how to figure this
out..)

prices

rebuilt heads $150 (local shop here)
pistons and cylinders $90.00 (kustom1 warehouse)
pushrod tube $1.69 x4 =$6.76 (busdepot)
bearing set main $21.95 (busdepot)
bearing set rod $6.75 (busdepot)
engine gasket set $6.49 (busdepot)
oil pump $15.95 (busdepot)
cam bearing set $10.00 (several avail, i picked highest priced set)

Total: $307.90

if you can do headwork yourself this price goes lower, if you need machine
work and additional parts, the price goes higher... but it IS possible to
build a 1600 engine for around $300.

IMHO, attention to detail in assembly and INSPECTING what you have is a
good thing, why replace a part if its still good.  You can easily spend
double or even triple this ammount PLUS on an engine, but you have to
decide if doubling or tripling your expense will double or triple your
service life...  thats up to you to figure out.

i'd personally add a new cam and lifters for another $150 or so, and
rebuilt conrods for $40 or so, but regrinding a crank and line boring a
case just as a matter of course i wouldnt do, learn to inspect properly
(buy precision tools... learn how to use em..) build a fixture to check
for crank runout, or have a reputable shop do it. check and see what size
it is, look and see if its nice and shiny or gouged up... maybe polish it
up a bit and measure it again.  Im no expert, read tom wilsons book!

i built my current engine this way and have put over 40k on it so far,
dunno how much longer i'll get, but i feel i have gotten my money's worth
by far. (even if i dont get much more thats my fault anyway, im not the
best about remebering oil change intervals...)

peas,

Steve

p.s. 40k miles is a tad longer than a week....
