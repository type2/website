&gt; &gt; The lead makes the fuel/air mixture burn slower, which means that power

&gt;             And when they use alcohol to lower the octane? I'm not sure
&gt; I'd agree that lead (or any other octane-booster) slows down the burning
&gt; rate, my understanding is that they increase the flame point, making it
&gt; harder to fire off the load. Don't know whether that translates into
&gt; slower burning or not.
&gt;        I suppose you could tune the low compression engine to better
&gt; utilize high octane fuels --- just by seriously advancing the spark, but

&gt; extra money for high-octane on a regular basis, I'd sure mill those heads.

Harmon:
I think higher octane does burn slower. Street driven cars this is only
a few degrees, but alcohol burning race cars typically light it off
45-50 degrees btdc! That's a lot, but a with a few other tricks like
nitromethane(provides oxygen), 1.2-1.4 blower overdrive, etc., that's
how they get 2000+ hp from 500 cu.in. motors!
