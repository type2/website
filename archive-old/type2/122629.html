Hello All,

I am a first time poster although i have been on the list for months,
i have a twin carb 2 litre '76 bus,
i was mucking around with the accelerator cable at the pedal and beyond,
(accelerator sticking)
i have done this before only this time the motor was not running, when i
kicked the motor over once finished,
the motor reved like you wouldn't believe, i disconnected the accelerator
cable, same thing,
i thought i'd adjust the idle screw to limit the fuel, same thing constantly
reving at about 5500 rpm,

i am a newbie at this although i love my bus dearly,
my local dub shop did me no justice,

any ideas????????????


Pete
