&gt; I thought after I put my engine back in that it wasn't getting fuel. It

&gt; now (I got some wires criss crossed on the coil maybe??). Could somebody 
&gt; direct me to an online diagram of what wires should be coming off the coil, 
&gt; or could you just tell me as there are only a few of them?  If anybody else 
&gt; has any other ideas, please share them with me. Thanks again.
