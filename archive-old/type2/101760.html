Subject: Re: [T2] POR15 Undercoat

Hiya Chris,

The POR15 operation you are contemplating is done quite often on Bugs.  

As far as trapping water goes, I don't think you'll have to worry about that. 
 POR15 won't cure properly over any existing water.  It'll blister.  Besides, 
you should have the bus inside in a heated area before you think about doing 
the POR15 thing.  Usually mentioned in POR15 threads is this advice, make 
sure you follow Restomotive's procedures for prepping and coating to the 
letter.  It's THE way to get a good job done.  And, by the way, although it's 
been mentioned that POR15 will degrade when exposed to UV, it will not lose 
any of it's rust preventing qualities.  It simply loses that black luster and 
turns color.

Also...........POR15 contains isocyanates (sp?).  Can we say, &quot;Really 
dangerous&quot;?  Geez, whatever you do, take all precautions when using this 
stuff.  You want to seal up the bottom of your bus, not plant yourself six 
feet deep.
