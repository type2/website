&gt; I just got through fixing this problem in my 66 panel. Differnet year bus,
&gt; but just about the same fix.
&gt; What I found out was that there was sooo much rust in the pivot area under
&gt; the bus that it did not want to move. I grabbed my propane torch heated up
&gt; the area and then doused it with &quot;Liquid Wrench&quot; or you could use &quot;WD-40&quot;.
&gt; Work outside cause that stuff stinks when it vaporises. Move the pedal a
&gt; whole bunch and squrit more WD-40. Repeat the process till the stuff

DANGER,  WD-40 is explosive in a flame

(new cans are less flamable but it is very recent)
