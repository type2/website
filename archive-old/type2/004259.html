Subject: 74 westy: convert from 1800 to 2000?

I have a 74 westy with a stock 1800 that needs a rebuild and I'm thinking
about upgrading it to a 2 liter.
Any advice from folks who've done this, or know what's involved, would be
appreciated.
I'm thinking the 2000 would give me more lowend torque for the mountains
around here (Seattle).

things like:
* carburetion (dual stock/weber/kadron vs. single weber/other)
* hydraulic lifters (yes or no)
* will i lose some topend performance compared to the 1800?
* know anyone in the Seattle area who does good rebuilds? or anyone I should
avoid?

Cheers,
Victor
