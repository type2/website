&gt;I have a Pittsburgh wrench from Harbor Freight, clicker type, 10-150ft
&gt;lbs, $19.99 part #  00239-1AVH   wouldn't use this if I were running an 
&gt;auto shop as it does not appear
&gt;very durable but in the limited use I give it and always keep it in a
&gt;plastic case and treat it carefully it has served me well for a couple
&gt;years, it might be off by a lb or two but it seems to be reasonably
&gt;accurate by my checking....YMMV

I use the same wrench and it meets all of my VW low torque needs.
