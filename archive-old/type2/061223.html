&gt;Hey Y'all,
&gt;  I have a 70 Bus that the trans went bad in and I swapped the trans for
&gt;an 091 from a later Bus. I don't know what year the trans came out of
&gt;and I want to find out what the ratio is. Is there a way I can find out
&gt;by the # on the side? Anyone know how to tell?

If it is an 091 trans it has a 32 tooth ring and 7 tooth pinion which
equals 4.57 to 1 for the final drive.  Gears 1-3 are approximately the same
as your old tranny and 4th gear is .89 - your old one probably had .82 4th
but I'm not positive of that.
