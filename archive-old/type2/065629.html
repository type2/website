Subject: Re:Split with Hiccups &quot;Q&quot;

Hi Folks
My mate who owns a 67 split window camper has had a problem that 
has kept us puzzled for years now. We would be very grateful for
any ideas.

It concerns a persistent tendency for the rear or the bus to
develop a severe case of hiccups while taking up drive in first
gear. 

Jobs done so far: (in a vain attempt to erradicate problem)

complete transaxle transplant
pair of torsion bar end bushes
transmission strap from Gene Berg
complete brake system renewed (pipes shoes cylinders etc)
new reduction box bearings
new wheel bearings
new clutch
engine runs perfectly (no end float)

Is this all just a sign of old age and wear? can it be sorted?

any advice or comments will gratefully recieved

many thanks in advance

Glynn (62 bus)
