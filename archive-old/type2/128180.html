sounds like a great idea and beats the hell out of clorox and such....
i cant seem to get rid of that smell off my hands even with gloves on for three days after cleaning with it... wished i would have looked this stuff right here up while back... would of saved me some health maybe..naw lol thats already shot
peace great suggestion... first poster of capt PHAB here is a link for all interested or a start to at least look at the product without doing the phone book search which i always find so dreaded... hunh whats that,, i dont know if we got it or not ?... never heard of it...that kind of thing.... gets frustrating.///
peace and love
chris
