Subject: RE: [T2] Starter woes

This is most likely a very common and easy to fix problem. Look on the type2 
home page under Library, look under &quot;S&quot; for &quot;Starter&quot;, and read the Starter 
Relay Installation article.

You could probably use a relay other than the one specified (I think a 
standard Ford starter contactor works). In the meantime, you might be able 
to get it to start when hot by crawling underneath the bus and beating on 
the solenoid with a screwdriver handle or small hammer.

Hello all,
    Here is my problem. I got to my bus last night to head home from work 
and
it won't start. I turn the key and nuthin. Headlights are very bright, 
barely
dim when I turn the key like normal. I don't hear a click or  anything just
nothing.  I got a ride home and when I came in this morning it started right
up. No problems at all.

I haven't gotten under there yet cause I'm at work right now, but when I do
what should I look for? Battery connections are good and I know the battery 
is
in good shape. Starter connections maybe. I didn't touch anything to make it
start up today. Gremlins maybe?? It was pretty cold last night about 20F, 
but
it wasn't much better this morning
