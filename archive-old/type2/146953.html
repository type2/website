Subject: Re: [T2] Wife sez the bus isn't reliable enough to go to
  California!

Don

&gt;. She said
&gt;it's fine for puttering back and to work, but she doesn't trust it for
&gt;anything else.
&gt;  
&gt;
That's why I bought a vanagon air-cool van ... for the adventure !!! ;-)

&gt;I think the triggers were the fact that my less than a year old Kragen
&gt;starter is going out and the bolts that hold the steering column to
&gt;under the dash popped out the other day 
&gt;
This kind of info should be hided at any cost to any wife , it is scary !!

For a long trip , I would definitely take tools , fuel pump, coil , oil  
and  extra gas , portable battery/converter.
Alternator  could  easily be found and change everywhere (assuming you 
brought the tools kit with you).
I also create and print a PDF file of the Bentley manual , it contains 
all the pages which concern my van in case I need to fix it , 20 pages !!!

oh  !!! don't forget the sun screen blocker, you may have to spay many 
in you legs  if you spend  too much  time  under the van fixing  things  
! California  Sun is really strong ! ;-)))
