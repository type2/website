VW friends--

A little less than a year ago, we poured $6,800 into rebuilding/
soundproofing/heat/rust prevention on our 1976 loaf. The lessons we learned
can help you silence/rustproof/heat your Vanagon...FINALLY.. the web page/site
giving you the techniques for a silent, warm, rustfree van is almost finished.

While we sold the bus, many prospective buyers wanted details on how we made
the 1976 loaf so quiet, warm, and well protected from corrosion. I will finish
the site in the next 24-48 and will post the link/location to this group. Lots
of pictures and graphics. Plenty of texual expalantion. Product names and
costs. Just like you asked for. :) 

I know it sounds like marketing, but I've just put alot of work into both the
van, and this site, and hope to reach those who really want this info. Sorry
for the long delay. I hope it helps. Now I must duplicate my efforts on our
new Westy. :)
