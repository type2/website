Dear Raoul and List Folks,

Here's the question,


PANTY HOSE??? What kinda camping are we talking about here?? I've driven my
bus all over the country in the last twelve years, without a single pair of
panty hose.
What am I missing??

Here's the answer:

1. a great strainer for all kinds of fluids
2. very, extra strong kind of tie down
3. handy mask for robbing liquor stores (just don't use the bus for the
getaway!)
4. almost better than long johns for wearing under clothing to stay warm
5. put your soap in the toe so you don't lose it in the shower and can hang
soap up to dry out
6. stretch around coathanger to seine for minnows for fishing

now ask about bobby pins :-)

Chris and Gus the &quot;I don't wear panty hose either...&quot; Bus
