Subject: Mexican bus sighting

While in Yuma AZ this week, I saw one of those Mexican loafs
with a radiator in the front. It had Baja plates. Also noted that an
air scoop had been put on the rear side (looked like an aftermarket
addition). I wonder if this means the watercooled still run hot, or
else this bus had been converted back to an aircooled engine.
