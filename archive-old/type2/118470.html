Subject: Re: [T2] INFO NEEDED: 16&quot; wheels and tires on a 1971 Westy ?

&gt; PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE... all information is needed in reference to
 installing 16&quot; (Mercedes 5X112) on my (1971 Westfalia Bus).... AND what kind
 of tires (sizes) did you use to make this happen ???
What about width, and offsets ??? Can everyone supply me some info on that ??

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mercedes wheels come in a BUNCH of different sizes and styles. But the major choice 1st will be to find a set
for the S class: 140 body, 215 body, 220 body and the ML SUV. These 4 bodies used 14mm wheel bolts. ALL the
rest used 12mm wheel bolts. [except the G-wagen, but it does not use 5 x 112 wheels] All the alloy wheels used
steel inserts for the wheel bolts. No one makes replacement inserts.... If you want to use the ones with 12mm
wheel bolt inserts, then you will need to drill them larger to use a 14mm bolt. Now you are going run into
another problem: all bay buses use 20 lug nuts and pressed-in wheel bolts. [Vanagons used 10 nuts and 10
bolts!] The bay studs are not long enough.
After you get past that hurdle, now you need to find a set of wheels with the closest to VW offset. Because
the S and ML bodies used a lot wider wheel, even if you did find one with an ET near the one you need for the
bus, the wheels will stick out too far and you will probably cut the sidewalls in the back.. The bus ET
[offset] is about 38.
Mercedes are anywhere from 35 to 42. [offset is referred to ET which stands for Einpress Tieffe in German]
Offset is the distance from the center line of the wheel to the bolt face on the backside of the wheel
measured in mm. Let's say you have a bus wheel. It is 5 1/2&quot; wide. [that measurement is always the width from
bead to bead, it does not include the thickness of the metal of the rim x 2!] Divide that by 2 and you have 2
3/4&quot;. So if you went across the back of the wheel with a straight edge and added the thickness of the rim,
let's say 1/4&quot;, you would need to measure from the back face of the wheel center to 3&quot; from the straight edge.
Make sense? 3&quot; is about 77mm so the total would be around 115mm.
You always want the offset to be as close to stock as you can get. The offset is designed to balance the
vehicle weight to the wheel bearings. If you look at any offset, it puts the back half of the wheel inboard.
The inner wheel bearings are usually twice the size of the outers. Less than 38mm offset will move the wheel
out and shift the weight load more to the smaller outer bearing... NOT good for the life of that little
bearing!
Now lets say you found a nice set of 16&quot; MB wheels with 14mm holes. You find them to be 7 1/2&quot; wide. On the
back, they normally always will have the ET. Lets say it says ET 42. The center line will be 3 3/4&quot; [95mm] +
42mm = 137mm.  This means the face of the wheel will be 22mm out further than the bus wheel. 22mm is about
7/8&quot;. Not a lot, correct? Well, it is. The distance between the stock 185R14 tire and wheel and the rear wheel
well lip on a late bay is 1 1/2&quot;. Using a wider wheel with an ET of 42 will use up an inch of that space.
Don't forget, I did not add the 1/4&quot; inch for the thickness of the rim.

Hope all this did not get you totally confused.....
