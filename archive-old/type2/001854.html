Yes you had headrests. 73 and up came with them. Only 73 to 79 bus headrests
will fit. 73-74 or 75 were soft, made of the same material as seat covers,
with a zipper across the bottom. 75 or 76-79 were hard molded headrests.
Either style were the same color as the seat. The soft ones had a problem
with age, the material where the zipper and the vinyl met deteriated and
separated. The hard molded ones last longer but they don't like cold and
movement.....if you pushed on a cold one, it will crack.

I may have a pair to match.

&gt; does anyone know if the original seats for a '75 came
&gt; with headrests? none of my seats do but they look like
&gt; they have holes where they would go. are these
&gt; compatible with other sets of headrests (ie. other vw
&gt; camper's and vanagon's)?just wondering about the
&gt; whiplash factor...
