Subject: sealing around compressor
Date: Tue, 29 May 2001 07:54:40 -0500
	charset=&quot;Windows-1252&quot;

How could I seal my engine compartment around where the compressor for the
AC is in the back left?  I'm taking a honeymoon road trip and have been
getting concerned about cooling, I think a lot of hot air comes up through
there from the exhaust.  I was thinking about using expanding foam that you
can tear out later if needed but the can says it's flammable in the uncured
state.  It doesn't say anything about flammability in the cured state.  Does
anyone know if this stuff is suitable for my application?  Or how else could
I seal it?

btw: I installed some air control flaps over the weekend, they do look to be
pretty essential!

Thanks in advance!!
