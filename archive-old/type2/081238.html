	I just took the hour and half to take a blade and scrape it all
off.  Spray water of windex on it while doing it and should come off
fairly easy.  Good luck.

Subject: [T2] tint removal


After unsuccesfully asking some local shops and hardware stores, I
thought I'd throw this out - does anybody know how to remove the window
tinting on my '71 Westfalia? It looks like that sticky film that is
glued on the inside of the window. How do I get this stuff off? It
doesn't look like the easiest job in the world yet...

Any help would be great! 
Thanks
Dan Curran
