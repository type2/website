Subject: Re: [T2] Re:fwd: Just-auto: VW to build Microbus at Hanover


Great, more people that own VWs that won't wave at me.  I've all but given =
up on 'new' Bug owners.  Anyway, it'll probably cost as much as a =
limousine too. =20

I love it when car manufacturers talk about the 'enthusiast', like we =
amass great sums of money just waiting for them to give us new versions of =
things most of us already have.

But build on VW, it makes for funny conversations in gas stations as =
people try to equate having a water-cooled bug to having an original.  I =
love it when they walk away wondering why I smell like exhaust and my =
right arm is sunburned from hanging it out the window.

This isn't to say that I'm not happy they are building it, just that it =
irritates me when manufacturers try to use 'enthusiasts' love for a =
specific model as a brand of approval for the masses.  I can just picture =
the marketing meetings as they decide how best to exploit our love for a =
model that only concerns them because they equate love with loyalty. =20

Sorry for the rant, but it's early here in Wales, and I miss my Bus in the =
U.S.

&gt; Hi Folks,

&gt; The article says the new bus will have &quot;high functionality with the =

&gt; Now don't get me wrong, I like creature comforts as much as the next guy =

&gt; the reason we like our '71 is the simplicity and practicality.  This new =

compare new beetle with original,  get the idea?
