Subject: RE: bed wood strips

&gt;    Does anyone know of a source for bed wood strips. We need a set to
&gt;complete the 69 single cab. Last set was obtained from Robert Davis
&gt;(awesome) but have lost his e-mail addy and thru the grapevine he no longer
&gt;does them. Any leads appreciated.

there's a feller named chad white, selling some single cab wood slats in
gabriel, california.
check type2_dot_com buy and sell, his post went up only a few days ago. perhaps
they'll be what your looking for.  no price listed   - steve
