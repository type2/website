Subject: Alan Schofield parcel shelves

Hi folks,

I was perusing the Alan Schofield catalog yesterday and noticed a line 
drawing of the under dash parcel tray he offers for the baywindow 
(wraparound) bus (it's S28 in the figure at 
http://www.ahschofield.co_dot_uk/page3.htm ).  It looks as if the two halves 
are shaped differently to allow special features for the driver's side 
(presumably to favor right hand drive).  Can someone who has seen these up 
close offer a description or photo?  I'm curious about the 
fit/function/look.   I assume they are made from fiberglass or light 
plastic?  It's 47UKP (~$75) for the pair.  That's reasonable compared to 
the black rubber/netting type parcel trays that can sell for as much as $150.

While I'm thinking about parcel shelves, I know this thread has come up in 
the past and some folks have made homebrew versions.  If you've made your 
own and wouldn't mind snapping some photos and doing a write-up, I'll 
gladly add it to the Type2 Library.

thanks,

Ron
