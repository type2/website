Hello all,

        Well, next week after I get the muffler, my bus will be on the
road. Yahoo! It's been a long time coming, about 8 months of repairing,
blood, sweat, tears, empty wallet, ect... Thanks for all of the help.
Now, my bus is a standard 71' 1600. It is not a camper. In it, the PO
left a sink with all of the attachments. It has a sticker on the side
that says campmobile on it. Is this a VW sink? If it is and anyone needs
or wants it, it's yours. If I don't get any responses in the next couple
of days, it is going to the dump, so let me know. I would prefer if any
interested party would pick it up, but I don't think any one on the list
lives near Lake Placid, New York. I will ship it off if you pay for
shipping. Any interested parties p-mail me. Also, if it's not VW, p-mail
me so I can dump it.

Thanks,
Nate
71 microbus
