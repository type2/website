&gt; I bought a tester and I'm going to test the compression this weekend.  What

&gt; - warm up engine first
&gt; - remove all plugs

&gt;
&gt; What I don't know is the best way to stop the fuel from flowing while I
&gt; perform the test.

Richard,

Use a remote starter switch to crank the engine, not the key.  With the
key off, there is no power to the ECU or fuel pump, thus neither flow nor
spray.  I got this advice from Karl who is (I hope :) asleep, since it is
4 AM in Fresno!
