Subject: Re: [T2] EGR....optional??

&gt; I talked to a guy who has worked on bugs and transporters for a while and he  told me i could disconnect the
whole Exhaust Gas Recirculation system, starting at the throttle without any negative consequences...he said
it doesn't work that well anyway.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Did he say what it does work for??
He probably does not have a clue!
Besides HC and CO, the 3rd pollutant is NOx. Oxides of nitrogen. NOx is formed when combustion temps exceed
2500 F. NOx contributes to the formation of acid rain.

EGR allows a percentage of inert spent exhaust into the combustion mixture to lower the temperature.
Since the Clean Air Act of 1970 all pollutants have dropped except NOx.

Your guy sure knows what he is talking about!
