Subject: Re: Rod Knock, was Beetle engine in a Bus

&gt;what did your rod knock sound like

Hi Volks

- Knocking noise under load on hills
- In my yard, I ran the throttle by hand,
  held the engine at high RPM and then abruptly brought it back to
  idle. As soon as I backed off I could hear the knock
- Getting the engine to idle properly was impossible
-Often would stall when coming to a stop.

And yes, ...valves were adjusted properly, etc, etc
