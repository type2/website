Subject: Re: [T2] 78 2.0 transplant into a 74 westy

No need to mess with the shift rod. I have a 2L in my 74 and I have used
both transmissions without any mods (I do have a quick shift kit though).
However, I am using a 215 flywheel and the '74 bellhousing. The reason for
this is that my engine was originally built for use with the stock tranny
and I decided later that I wanted the taller 091 gearing. Everything will
bolt right in. Same for the brake booster - only difference between the
earlier and later style is the size of the diaphragm.
However, if your 2L is FI you will need to find a place to mount the fuel
pump and provide for a fuel return.
