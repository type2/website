Subject: Re: [T2] Homeland .... now cold great white north stories

The most impressive thing about it was that the bus ran amazing.
Started easy, and power was outrageously awesome.
How many busses in the states have a block heater?

Yep - until you've experienced 40 below - you have no idea how cold that is 
- you cannot not describe to someone what 40 below is like.

I drove my 60 around Winnipeg a few times when it was 20 below - I'd use a 
hot air popcorn popper under the engine to heat the oil up enough so the bus 
would start - but then - when you live on the prairies - minus 20 is a nice 
winter day.
