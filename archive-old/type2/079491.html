&gt; Start with an oil cooler, as you mentioned. Devise a good way to send oil

&gt; tin.

Then problem that I see with this is that you can very easily OVER cool
your engine...the oil never warms up, which never brings the rest of the
engine up to temp...and of course, you dont get much heat.

You'd have plenty of heat in the summer, of course.  But I know that when
i've driven in the rather cold climates, even extended foot to the floor
drives, the engine just doesnt get all that hot.  Oil temps of ~100
degrees or so were the norm in subfreezing temperatures.

I'm sure someone out there knows the formula to determine how hot the air
would be crossing an oil cooler that was 100 degrees F, if it started out
at, say, 10 degrees F.
