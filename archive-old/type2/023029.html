&gt;Anyone ever hear of a water cooled oil cooler?  I came across this webpage
&gt;http://www.si-inc_dot_com/subaru/modine.htm which describes one that attaches to
&gt;a spin-on oil filter boss on Subaru engines.  Looks like it might work on
&gt;Type 4s with a simple water circulation system.  I'm trying to get more
&gt;info.

Sure, I've heard of them.  In water cooled cars they are a big win. The 
reason they are so great is that the water coolant heats up quickly and is 
then regulated at a set temperature, usually around 190 degrees.  Oil on 
the other hand takes much longer to heat up and is not externally 
regulated.  If you utilize an oil cooler inside the radiator, for example, 
you get a dual benefit.  When the car is cold, the oil is heated up very 
quickly by the radiator water and once the car is warmed up, the oil temp 
is kept from going much above the fixed water temperature.

Unfortunately for us air-cooled owners, there is no way to realize these 
benefits and therefore I don't see any compelling reason to use an 
oil-to-water cooler.  It would add a lot of complexity with no benefit and 
IMO a traditional oil-to-air cooler would be a better choice.

By the way, for those concerned about high oil temperatures, I've had two 
friends recently install oil temperature gauges in their Mustangs (in the 
sump, no less!) who have been road racing with me for years.  They both 
discovered to their horror that during their 20-minute sessions on the 
track their oil was sustaining temps of 250-270 degrees!  The cars have 
held up to these temps for years while being flogged mercilessly on the 
track (we all use synthetic oil).  This is one of the reasons that I am not 
too concerned about seeing what some consider to be high oil temps in my 
bus.  I don't believe that the oil breaks down and fails to lubricate at 
250 or even 270 degrees if there is decent pressure behind it.  That said, 
I still slow down when I get over 240 degrees, just for a margin of 
safety  - YMMV.
