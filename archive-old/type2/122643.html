Subject: Distributor rebuild info

Hey folks...

Next week or so I'm going to be putting a new ACN SVDA + Pertronix into 
my bus.  My plan is to keep my old distributor as-is as a spare for a 
couple of weeks just to make sure everything is cool with the new one.

After the burn-in period, I want to rebuild my old distributor to keep 
as a permanent spare w/ P+C.  I was considering sending it to a 
rebuilder (either as a core, or to have them turn mine around for me), 
but after thinking about it, I think I'd like to take a stab at 
rebuilding it myself.

My distributor is a Bosch # 0 231 181 012 (VW # 022 905 205 AB) DVDA.  
Can anyone point me in the direction of rebuild kits and information on 
the rebuild procedure?

Thanks!
