I replaced the front shift rod bushing and the rear coupling in my 74 
single cab..(old ones worn out), haven't replaced the two rear shift rod 
bushings yet,  Occasionally, when downshifting from 3rd to second, the 
truck sometimes wants to go in reverse!  What could be causing this?  I've 
noticed that you don't have to push the shift lever down into the floor to 
get it in reverse, just pull it hard toward you.  I've also noticed, that 
the stop plate under the shift rod mount has a LOT of wear on the little 
portion of it that protrudes up toward the right front of the truck.  Could 
that be causing it?  I'm getting real frustrated with sloppy shifting.  TX!
