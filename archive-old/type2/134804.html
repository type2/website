Subject: Re: [T2] pressure relief valve

Cut a short piece of tubing (rubber or
plastic) about an inch long and about the same diameter as the ID of the
piston (valve), slit it longitudinally, take a long bolt (e.g., carriage) a 
little
larger than the ID of the tubing; start threading the tubing on the bolt and
then push the bolt with tubing on the end up into the piston. The bolt and
tubing must be sized to fit into the piston so that as the bolt is threaded
in, it expands the tubing tightly against the piston ID allowing it to be
withdrawn.

&gt; Muir says to take that valve out clean it, and re install.  Mine is not 
&gt; coming
&gt; out easily.  Out to buy a tap set.
&gt; Is it that easy, take out clean, and re install?
&gt; Anything else I should be aware of?

Kind Regards,
