&lt;&lt; there are probably others better qualified to answer this,
but it is my understanding that in the later models, the
sender can be replaced without dropping the motor.

however, it does require some cutting/removing of sheet metal
inside the bus in the area above the sender.

I seem to recall a post about a factory service memo about this.
Probably for servicing a sender that had failed under warranty...
