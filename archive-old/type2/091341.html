&gt; don't but there is vacum to the domed side).

Depends on the engine and distributor.  If &quot;the book&quot; you refer to is
Muir's, well, he was writing for early buses.  All the VWs he was
dealing with were vacuum advance only and static is best for them.  As
time passed, things changed and got way more complicated.

Go to Jim Thompson's distributor pages and look at which dist you have.
*Generally* vacuum advance distributors are best timed staticly; vacuum
advance/vacuum retard distributors *MUST* be timed with a timing light
with the engine running; and vacuum/mechanical advance distributors
*should* be timed with a gun (timing light), but static is an acceptable
substitute to get you home to the gun.

If you are stuck on the road without a timing light with a vacuum
advance/retard unit, you may (emergency only) disconnect the vacuum retard
line from the distributor, leave the pipe to the distributor open, plug
the line to the manifold and time to 7.5 BTDC statically.  Watch your
temps as you drive tho... this is NOT &quot;right&quot; it is only to get you home.
