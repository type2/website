&gt;The only 'at rest' voltage drains are the stereo/clock and a faux 
&gt;alarm/blinking LED (a running joke with my friends). These have not been a 
&gt;problem for the last few years.

Randy,
You might be surprised at how much current a clock/radio draws in what we 
have come to think as being &quot;standby&quot;.

My clock/radio is relatively new to the technology,
http://freeweb.pdq_dot_net/perring/newbus2/Radio%20Shack%20Tunes.JPG
and still, if I leave all power to the radio connected up, and just turn 
the on/off switch into the &quot;off&quot; position I am still drawing surprisingly 
high current. It appears the power amp in the radio is Class A design for 
low distortion, and, as a result, draws high current regardless of the 
volume setting via the driver stage power levels. The radio's on/off switch 
evidently does not properly remove power from the circuit most needing 
power removal so as to minimize &quot;off state&quot; power consumption.

My solution is to leave the voltage always connected to the clock and 
station memory bank (very low current draw here), but isolate the actual 
tuner/amp portion via an additional switch. It is the silver pull switch 
shown here in the picture over on the left side of the dash right beside 
the interior lights pull switch.

What I wind up with is clock and station memories always powered and saved, 
and the radio is only receiving power when I pull the silver switch.

A way to find out if you have high &quot;standby/parked state&quot; current draw on 
your battery is to disconnect the main positive battery lead and then put a 
milliameter in series with that main positive battery feeder .
If you show current pull when all things are &quot;at rest&quot;, there is the 
problem to find the source of and resolve.
