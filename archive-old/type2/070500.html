Subject: wooden rear bumpers, beards, mud flaps, dancing bear stickers

&gt;[I couldn't find a rear bumper] SO, I put on a lovely piece of treated 4x4,
which will serve as ample
&gt;protection. It is painted to match the bus, and actually looks nice...
&gt;It was also only a couple bucks...
&gt;
&gt;- -- 
&gt;Poor Richard

I tried that on a bug once, but I made the mistake of wearing a beard (just
returned from 3 weeks in AK).
.....so the cop pulls me over, tells me I don't have mudflaps on my car!!!
cites me for about 6 or 7 vehicular infractions (front bumper not long
enough, rear bumper not long enough, horn doesn't work, emergency brake
doesn't work, no mud flaps, etc., etc., etc.  He tells me, &quot;the bumper has
to be made of THE METAL SUBSTANCE.&quot; ?  I tell him that there is nothing
wrong with the emergency brake, just adjusted it last week (true).  He says
&quot;put it on and keep your foot off the brake pedal.&quot;
He huffs and puffs and shoves on the bug until his face turned red, says
&quot;alright *sshole, gimme that ticket.&quot;  crosses out the bit about no E-brake,
gives me 10 days to fix the other stuff.  

punchline:

I didn't even have any dancing bears, or any other stickers on the car.

second punchline:

Later on I checked the REVISED CODE OF WASHINGTON, and sure enough--you
gotta have mud flaps on your car.  Funny I never see any new mercedes off to
the side getting ticketed for this!
