Subject: RMMW Show in Colorado
Date: Fri, 21 Jul 2000 11:36:04 US/Mountain

Anyone planning on attending the Rocky Mountain Motorworks show in Woodland 
Park, Colorado on August 5?  It's supposed to be a pretty cool show with a big 
turnout.  Anybody know a web page with info for it?

The Colorado VW Bus Club will be having a campout that weekend at Rainbow Falls 
Campgrounds.  I don't remember what the cost is, but it's cheap (like under $10 
I think).  If you're interested, let me know and I'll find out the
details...
