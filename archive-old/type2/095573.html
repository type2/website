--Okay, so nobody with f.i. ever made it far from home huh?

70's era VW f.i. is not exactly brain surgery folks. You think you're gonna &quot;more than likely be a garage tow&quot; just by having f.i. in your car?

If better gas mileage and not having my powerplant freeze up on a cold day is a PITA, I'll take it.

Billy

&gt;I think it would be called PITA factor.. LOL. FI would be a PITA on &gt;the road, in my opinion. That would more than likely be a garage &gt;tow 1,000 miles from home. Jan B
