=====================&gt;
I used to run an old Galaxy V 300 watt tube type xcvr with the solid 
state 12VDC to 600 VDC solid state converter type power supply in my 
'67 bug back during that time frame.

I have run several other radios in various VW cars over the past few 
years with out any trouble to the stock generators.

The newer solid state xcvrs are even better as far as NOT overloading 
the stock generators........... no filaments to keep hot.
My new IC706 runs just perfect in my stock 70 buses.
