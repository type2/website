Subject: Re: [T2] quick easy  temp heat

I use a small space heater , 1500 watts, to preheat my bus when its cold and
it is adequate to warm it up but it is running of my house electricity.  Your
alternator cannot generate the necessary power to heat your bus most small
electric heaters pull out 1200 -1800 watts. watts = volts x amps so 1200 watts
divided by 12 volts equals 100 amps!!!! factory bus alternator is 55 amps. you
could also start a fire trying to pull that much juice through your wiring.  I
think in a do or die situation a small propane heater is a satisfactory
method, there has been much discussion on this topic so im sure if you search
the archives you will find a plethora of information.  also the small
accessory heaters ( i have one, got it as a gift) only get warm and are
useless for any practical heat, might help clear a few square inches of fogged
window though.
good luck

&gt; I drove up there about a month ago and my feet were the worst of all my
&gt; parts, I figured if I could get a little 12v heater to plug into the cigg
&gt; lighter or get an inverter and a little space heater id be all good.
