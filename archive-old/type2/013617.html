&gt;When I got home I decided to disconnect the voltage 
regulator thinking
that this would cause the alternator to operate at 
maximum and recharge
my battery more quickly.  As the engine started to die

after I
disconnected the regulator I reconnected it at which 
point the engine
ran very very slowly for about ten seconds.  I'm sure 
many of you are
laughing by now and saying what an idiot.

Jason,
Is this a fuel injection bus?  If it is, I suspect
that you could have fried the FI computer with too
high of a voltage, by operating with the voltage
regulator disconnected.
