        Depends on the design, materials, where you are buying them from --
for instance, one FLAPS wanted to charge me $65 for a wheel bearing. Do you
think it was any better than the $10 one? Hardly. But some rings, like Total
Seal, might seal better. Biggest problem with re-ringing is the pistons. If
the grooves are worn out too wide, the gas pressure coming through those
slots in the ring grooves won't push the rings outward to make a good seal.
Pistons can be re-grooved in a machine shop to take wider rings, but it
would probably cost more than a new set of pistons. Maybe not.

&gt; Hi y'all,

&gt; I asked this a couple weeks ago, and got no replies. Do $60 rings seal
&gt; better than $25 rings -- make up for, um, imperfections in the ring
&gt; grooves and whatnot? Or do they just last longer?
