Subject: Re: [T2] type IV oil temps

[...]
In my 82 in the thin Colorado altitude I will run 270 in steep long 
climbs, and on one steep climb at 8600 feet hit just under 300.  Head 
temps held just fine at just over 350 for the steep heavy loaded 
climbs.  I noted that at altitudes lower than 5000 my temps on hill 
climbs are lower.

&gt; Hello Volks,
&gt; I get to put my Vanagon to the long distance test with my new rebuild.
&gt; Seattle to Reno and back. I've got a 1981 stock FI with the newly

&gt; oil temp sensor on the sump plate. What is an acceptable daytime, up the
&gt; hill temp reading?
