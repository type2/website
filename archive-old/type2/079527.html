&lt;&lt; I'm sure someone out there knows the formula to determine how hot the air
would be crossing an oil cooler that was 100 degrees F, if it started out
at, say, 10 degrees F.

I found the upright engine to be &quot;fairly&quot; easy to plumb to get extra heat from
the engine: 
Capped off the two tubes on the doghouse.
Installed a three speed heater motor in the wheel well.
Ducted (through a gasketed hole) the blower to the inlet holes in the heat
exchangers.
The blower moter recirculates interior air through the heat exchangers.
The engine fan is only used for engine cooling.

The later engines could use a similar system, with the aux. blower ducted
to recirculate interior air instead of air taken from the engine compartment.
I haven't tried this one so I can't verify results.
