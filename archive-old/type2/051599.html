Subject: [T2] Front Shock Question-'77 Westy

Hey Folks,
    Bought some new KYB shocks today, and having a bit of a problem. When I
removed the old shocks, a spacer stuck on the lower shock mount, which was
easy enough to remove (and I kept). The new shocks aren't as wide at the
bottom mount as the old ones, and therefore can't be tightened down without
some side to side movement. Can the spacer be pounded out of the new ones
(it doesn't seem to want to budge) and the old spacer put in it's place?
Or, did they just sell me the wrong shocks?  TIA, Jeff S.
