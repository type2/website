Subject: Re: [T2] Why won't it bleed?

[...]

&gt;     You may want to check both rear wheels to see if either one is locking
&gt; up. Jack both rear off the ground, when you apply the brakes do they lock
&gt; up? If either one lock up, then the master cylinder is good. If nether one
&gt; locks up then like OldVolks says it a goner, replace, and bleed.

You guys are forgetting about the pressure regulator. I have seen this fail
more often than the master cylinder when no brake fluid comes out the rear
cylinders.
It is mounted up in the frame on the drivers side middle.
Before I condemned the master cylinder, I would check for brake fluid on the
input side of the regulator. Bleed it like you are at the rears, except you
are cracking the line loose. If you get fluid under pressure going in, try
cracking the output line and see if you get fluid under pressure.... more than
likely you won't.
