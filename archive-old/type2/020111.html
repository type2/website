Mike, for the premier Vegetable oil story, go to www.veggievan_dot_org! They
drove over 10k miles basically for free! All over the US. I am trying to
procure a diesel Vanagon and convert over. (Bus Content!)
I have a question for the list.Does anyone have the clutch pedal,
long(complete) shift rod and a Bowden tube and bracket from a donor bus
I cab purchase or trade for?I need the whole clutch pedal assy,
preferably from a '77 loaf. I have a good 009 dist, a 205(not sure what
letter) single vac. bisquit dist, a good(vatted and pressure tested) T-2
stock oil cooler, T-4(_at_) tin up to Vanagon, other misc T-2 parts, lotsa
Vanagon body parts. My parts source for the shifter stuff CRUSHED  all
his vans, stating I didn't get there soon enough. Ha! Negative Busma is
out to get him! Thanks, Volks.

Chris.
