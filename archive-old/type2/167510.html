Subject: exhaust header gaskets

putting on new heads, and something that has always driven me crazy is
keeping those copper gaskets in place (78, 2 liter engine) while the
header was put in place.

what will &quot;REALLY&quot; hold those things in place.  I've seriously considered
a drop of Krazy glue !?!?!

thanks
Bob
