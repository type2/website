Hi folks
TGIF
Literally 100's of bikers are streaming by here all day,,, the ritual
pilgramage of Friday the 13TH to raise hell on the main st of Port Dover
ontario!  About 8000 bikes in total today,, not all have past by here tho!

Besides that, I am investigating putting a little more HP in my Camper,,, I
have read about Subaru 2.2, and Ford Turbo 2.3.  and ford 2.0,  but a fellow
suggested I try a Toyota 1600 Twin CAm engine,,
I used to have a 74 Bus that I put the Capri V6 in with K.E.P. adapters,, I
still have that adapter, but I am leaning towards a 4 cyl this time,,

Ok, so my ears are perked,, and I thought I'd ask the list a question

I would like all opinions on using alternate engines in the 74 style VW
bus,.
Toyota, Mazda miata, Honda, ,,, What do you think is best?
Could you send me info,, or URL's..  please no large files or pics as It
will swamp me!
Thanks!
