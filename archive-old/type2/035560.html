Subject: Re: Hub Cap and Bad Mojo

If this is the cas then I cant wait to get the hub cap! Since my bus wouldn't 
have made it to Okeechobee without using 3 quarts of oil, maybe the cap will 
bring my bus great karma and rid the engine of those nasty  oil burning 
demons!  I can't wait! Where is it?  I know i could make it half way to 
Gainesville and hand it off to Bill.
