Subject: &quot;B&quot; light on dash?

From the archives, Steven H Dolen said :

&quot;On different years of bus there are three different bulb tests that are
applied.  On some years, you press the B and it lights, on some years the
bulb comes on when you start the car and goes off when the car starts
(along with the gen light), and on some years the light comes on when the
parking brake is engaged.&quot;

So, my B light suddenly started coming on, but only when the parking brake 
is engaged.
I guess that means the 'test' part of this light just decided to suddenly 
start working, and
I don't actually have anything to worry about?
