Subject: [T2] Gas Heater Seminar/Forum

Announcing a Gas Heater Seminar/Forum.
Presented by the Kansas City Kombies VW bus club, a local chapter of NEATO.
Units focused on will be the Eberspacher BN/4 and Stewart Warner South Wind
heaters for the VW bus.
We will have copies of the Eberspacher BN/4 and Stewart Warner South Wind
heater manuals available.

When:  February 18th (Sunday) at 2pm.
Where:  To be announced, but within the Kansas City Metropolitan area.

This is a general outline of what we will be covering:
***1.  The history of gas heaters (you won't believe how old these things are).
***2.  Types of gas heaters (we will have a number on display).
A.  Differences between brands and models.
B.  Configurations (placement within vehicle)
C.  Parts compatibility (if you pick up a heater that isn't what you want,
the parts may fit on a model that you do want).
***3.  Theory of Operation. (for ease of viewing, we have a working gas
heater on a stand)
A.  Description of the various parts and their purpose. (one heater has
been disassembled to show the parts, I was going to call it an exploded
view, but decided that may not be the best choice of words)
B.  Heater safety controls.
C.  Controlling the heater and thermostats.
D.  How much fuel the heater will use.
E.  Extra battery (for running heater with engine off) and battery isolator
switch.
***4.  Maintenance, Repair and Rebuilding
A.  Inspection when purchasing.
B.  What to look for, or replace when rebuilding.
C.  Yearly maintenance and inspection.
D.  6 to 12 volt conversion.
***5.  When purchasing a used gas heater, what to look for and how much you
should pay. (or how not to get burned on the deal).
A.  What a &quot;complete&quot; heater package should include (of course we have one
to show you and no it's not for sale!).
B.  Swap meets
C.  Classifieds
D.  Prices
***6.  Sources for rebuilt heaters, parts and service.
A.  Parts for Eberspacher BN/4
B.  Parts for South Wind heaters (I am having trouble with this one)
C.  Sources for rebuilt and ready to install heaters.
D.  Sources for Eberspacher BN/4 mechanics.
E.  Sources for South Wind mechanics (again, I am having trouble finding some)

This seminar/forum will be a pooling of information from a number of people
(we would welcome any information you might have to add).  We do not
profess to know all the answers, but you should come away with a new
perspective about gas heaters.  We want to dispel the image most people
have of gas heaters being dangerous, difficult to install and hard to keep
working.

Having a working gas heater is a wonderful way to lengthen the camping
season and make your winter driving a very enjoyable and warm experience.
