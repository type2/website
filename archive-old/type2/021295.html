Re those red tubes to spray GumOut or Wd40 or Liquid Wrench:
I save those tubes; there are spares in the tool box.  If you keep the
cap of the can, bend the tube into the cap (need the &quot;double&quot; caps that
are the size of the can).   If you lose the tube, clip the ends off a
q-tip, most are hollow plastic tubes.  Drill out the hole in the spray
tip if they are too large.  I extend the plastic tube by slipping the
q-tip over the red tube. You could tape a q-tip tube to the can and slip
the red tube into it for a holder.
     Now here's a trick to direct the spray around corners- wrap solder
around the tube, or that soft hobby wire in art stores.  This you can
bend to hold the tube at any curve.  MB
