Subject: Re: [T2] flywheel

There are several different ways to check endplay.

http://www.google_dot_com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;oe=UTF8&amp;q=vw+flywheel+end+play&amp;spell=1

for some links.

www.nateswaterart_dot_com/vw/end_play/ 
shows how to make one youself as well.

I just use a dial indicator &amp; a magnetic base &amp; attach it to the
flywheel to measure.

&gt; Ok I need to buy a gauge to check the endplay of my crankshaft. I am
&gt; borrowing a car to get it so:
&gt; 
&gt; What is it called? I am going to a FLAPS and I could go to Sears. Anything
&gt; special I need to know?
&gt; 
&gt; Also with the flywheel bolted on and the cooling fan on the hub I can't seem
&gt; to get either to move back and forth at all! Is this maybe because I have
&gt; too many shims or shims that are too thick?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any support! I haven't driven in 3 weeks now and am desperate to
&gt; get this engine in again!

&gt; &gt; &gt; I am trying to install the flywheel on my new rebuilt AVP engine. But I
&gt; am
&gt; &gt; &gt; having some trouble.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; My engine turns fine with the flywheel off. Once I put the flywheel on,
&gt; &gt; &gt; lining up the pin and lightly tightening the 5 bolts, the engine won't
&gt; turn
&gt; &gt; &gt; anymore. Its as if the flywheel is fouling the case. I have not torqued
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; bolts to 80ft lbs yet.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; you need to set your endplay....  it will totally screw up your brand new
&gt; &gt; engine if you don't...job 17.5 pg 65/66 in the Engine Clutch chapter of
&gt; &gt; Bentley explains how to do this better than I ever could
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Bob
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I thought maybe I needes some shims. After researching the archives I
&gt; see
&gt; &gt; &gt; that there should be some shims for crankshaft endplay, and I am not
&gt; sure
&gt; &gt; &gt; what they look like, but on my AVP engine the main seal was already
&gt; &gt; &gt; installed and there seem to be some &quot;rings&quot; there with an o-ring over
&gt; them.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I assume these are the shims and that AVP has already taken care of
&gt; this.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Why won't my engine turn with the flywheel on? Am I missing some shims
&gt; or
&gt; &gt; &gt; something. I have been reading my Bentley but am at a loss.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am reusing the flywheel, the correct 210mm for my 72 Westy and
&gt; although I
&gt; &gt; &gt; haven't gotten that far a new 210 Sachs clutch.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks!!
