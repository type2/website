Subject: Re: [T2] Re: '71 Brake Warning Light

Hiya Jules,

Hmmm.......just a thought......is it possible that the electrical connections 
at the brake light itself might not be correct?  It is pretty easy to get 
them mixed up - one has to really look hard to find the hook-up numbers on that 
light housing.

Mike
