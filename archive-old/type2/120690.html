Subject: Re: [T2] Starting a road trip, need advice

&gt; Also has someone had experience using a spring pcs phone as a
wireless modem?

A co-worker of mine has a Handspring Treo 600 through Sprint. While
passenger-seat riding through the Cascades, en route to Mt. Hood he ran
his laptop through his phone and got directions to their cabin. Was he
in a bus? No, that would have been too perfect. He was able to get a
signal strong enough to Mapquest while driving through the mountains,
though. If you aren't familiar with this particular area, its remote,
and cell coverage is spotty for most carriers, especially once you
enter the Mt. Hood Nat'l Forest.
Good luck, sounds like an interesting project--

&gt; Thanks and any input is welcome. I'm probably going to be updating as
&gt; the
&gt; summer progresses at my bus website. http://anyathebus.tripod_dot_com
