Subject: Re: [T2] 70 westy-front wheel knock

&gt; &gt; True CVs can make an ungodly thump. Good idea to check the boots and
&gt; &gt; maybe regrease them if its been a long time or never.
&gt;
&gt; If it's thumping, the CV needs replacing, not greasing!

well george Ide have to say yes and no to that.
Ive had thumpy cvs that were grooved and obviously bad and got replaced
BUT Ive also had torn boots and scary sounding cvs that were fine upon
inspection and once greased and reused, lasted for, well, a long time as
they are still in use.
