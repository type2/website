Subject: Sticking rpm's

Hi all,
	I know the subject heading sounds weird but I have this problem
that has been hapening lately.  Every once in a while after I have been
driving at 50-60mph for a little while it seems that when I slow down and
come to a stop or put the bus in neutral the engine comes down and stays
at about 2000 rpms for 20-30 seconds before slowly coming all the way back
to idle.  I am not sure what is casing this, is it possible that the
disrtibutor is sticking with the timing advanced from when I was at speed?
Any thoughts would be appreciated.  TIA
