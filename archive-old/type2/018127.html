&gt; I've often heard of doing this but have never understood the theory of

Jack:
It gives the excessive blowby associated with high revs and high loads
another path out in addition to the oil filler tower. Look at any small
block Chevy super mod or stock car and you'll usually see 2 tall oil
fill tubes and breathers on each rocker cover. Relieving the pressure
this way takes some of the pressure off the main seals and makes their
job easier. Total seal rings and other plans to reduce blowby help too.
