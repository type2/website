If I may ask, what is CDI?

Thanks,

&gt; &gt; I just installed a new tiger 581 on my 78 FI westfalia. It works fine
&gt; &gt; but makes a high pitched squeal when the ignition is turned on. To
&gt; &gt; anyone who has one of these installed, is this normal?
&gt; 
&gt; This is normal. Kind of sounds like an old school TV when on.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; ...This module was

&gt; 
&gt; Glad to hear they make one now. I bought one three years ago and it's
&gt; still sitting in a box because I haven't figured out how to overcome the
&gt; technical problems of that crossover to make it work on my '78. WHen
&gt; hooked up, my car won't start. I built the crossover box described in
&gt; their instructions (and kindly reprinted for us on this list by Sami
&gt; Dahklia a few years ago), but it doesn't go. Apparently that works on a
&gt; '76 with it's earlier verson FI, but not on a '78 with air flow
&gt; controlled FI. But the CDI does make that high pitched whine while
&gt; failing to work.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, did your gas mileage or performance improve after installing CDI, as
&gt; claimed by Bob Hoover in his Sermons and by CDI promotional literature?
