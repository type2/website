&gt; Painted or powder coated fan shroud?

Painted. The powdercoater wanted another $125 to setup for a second color
and I didn't want a black shroud. I did get him to sandblast the shroud and
fan for me as part of my engine tin powdercoating. He did that practically
for free.

&gt; BTW, I notice that you didn't have a &quot;plug&quot; for the hole in the center of
&gt; your fan..neither did I...anyone know where to get one?

Nope. That part was disconnected in the 1/79 fiche (and even says NLA in the
3/75 fiche). I guess it popped out and VW decided it was a bad idea to have
bouncing around in there.
