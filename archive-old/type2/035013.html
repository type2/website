Channel 19 is very popular for Truck drivers, but different locations use 
different channels, all of the drivers at my company use 12 when they are in 
this state. The local drivers always use 12. I am assuming that this is the 
same for other comapnies as well. I would rather just have some sort of 
scanner in my Type 2, something that you can get weather info from. Plus, I 
just couldn't have one of those 10-foot antennaes bobbing back and forth as I 
drove..........we should kill this thread....
