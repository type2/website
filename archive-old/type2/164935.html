Subject: Re: [T2] Possible areas of oil leak?

I am in the exact same spot with my '77.

I do not have oil on the tin under the fan pulley, just on the bottom of my motor near the back.

Interested in hearing a list of possible causes.

JM

&gt; I have been having a leak on my 2.0L 77 Westy since I got it, and thought it was 
&gt; the passengers side inner pushrod tube seals where they go into the block. I 
&gt; crawled under last night after removing the rocker arms, and although two of 
&gt; them are weepy, they wouldn't cause the amount of leak I'm seeing after I park 
&gt; and shut it off. On closer inspection, I see it quite wet up around the area of 
&gt; the oil pump/engine backside, but of course it's tough to see what it is for 
&gt; sure up in there.
