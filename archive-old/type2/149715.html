Subject: RE: [T2] bending brake lines

I would probably heat the line in the oven, and then roll a piece of pipe 
across it to unfold the bend.  Go slowly and it'll be just fine.  I have 
used the same technique to bend the lines, too.

i am especially concerned about the long rear line which was
shipped in a long loop.
