4900 lbs?!?  Does your bus really weigh that much?  Mine only weighs 4000
and that's with the highroof, fridge, deep cycle batteries, tools, and
camping gear.  Oh, and really heavy tires (BFG All-Terrain TA).

&gt;I guess the difference between the CR on a carbed 74 1800 bus engine and the
&gt;CR on a (probably fuel injected) 1974-75 914 1800 is directly related to
&gt;combined volume of the dish in a bus piston and the dome on the 914 piston.

Sounds right, although I guess there could be a difference in the
combustion chamber volume too.

&gt;Is 5cc a standard volume for the dish in an 1800 bus piston?

Don't know, but that sounds close.  I measured the dish in a 2-liter bus
piston at 15ccs if that helps.
