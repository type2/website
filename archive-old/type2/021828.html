&gt; Our 1976 2000ccFI motor started loosing power and developed a rough idle. 
&gt; Pulling the #3 wire off the distributor made no difference in the way it ran, 
&gt; and the#4 seemed to make only a little change in the idling. New spark plugs 
&gt; made no difference, but then I replaced the fuel injectors with new ones and 
&gt; now she runs like a charm again!
&gt; All the fuel injectors were originals with 179,000 miles on them...
&gt; The question: Should the other two be replaced? Senior advisor says leave 
&gt; them alone, the engine runs fine as is. Gut feeling says get new ones for the 
&gt; other side too.
&gt; Experienced opinions please?
&gt; Thanks, Bucket
