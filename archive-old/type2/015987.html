&gt;When I bought my '74 1800 bus, with dual PDSIT Solex

&gt;the stock VW vacuume advance distributor in favor of
&gt;the ever popular 009.
&gt;I wish, however to switch back to the stock VW
&gt;distributor, and do not know which vacuume port should
&gt;attach to where.
&gt;I know this is a mostly visual question, but can any
&gt;one help?

The connection on the flat, inside part of the canister is the vacuum
retard - it goes to the port at the base of the left carb (in the throttle
body).  The connection on the outer, sorta-rounded part of the distributor
is the vacuum advance - it goes to the port in the middle of the carb (that
is, halfway between the top and the bottom) on the outer side of the carb.
This port exists on both carbs, and you can hook it to either one, but the
left carb is closer.
