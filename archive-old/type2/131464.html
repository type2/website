Subject: Re: [T2] Ring Removal Tool

Thanks all.

I picked up the Lisle Piston ring Remover at a FLAPS on the way home.  I 
have four domed 1700 pistons from a Porsche 914 that I had cleaned up pretty 
good, but I did not take the rings off.

Tonight, with the new tool, I took all the rings off, and it was fun and 
easy.  My first time.  I did not expect to see so much crud under the oil 
rings.

now that I know, I will take the rings out of my 2000 pistons before I bead 
blast them.

Thanks again for putting me on the right track for the right tool. It makes 
the job into a hobby.

BTW, last month I bought a GearWrench reversible wrench at 10mm size.  It 
just barely fits the adjusting nut on the '72 distributor.  I can put it on 
and loosen or tighten the adjusting nut with a few flicks of the handle, so 
I can move the distributor to time it.  Of course, on the '72, the air 
cleaner body must come off in order to loosen or tighten the distributor 
adjusting nut.  Too bad I can't just flip the collar 180 degrees, bottom to 
top, so the adjusting nut on the '72 is toward the rear [FIF] of the 
distributor

A 'friend' gave me a set of PDSIT 32-34 carbs for the '72.  They were 
visually in sad shape, but the bushings on the throttle are very tight.  And 
they seem to be from a '72, also.  I will swap the throttle plates with my 
installed carbs.

Also, this 'friend' is going to hone my cylinders for me, after I get them 
out.  To reciprocate, I was able to find the vent windows he needed for his 
'81 Rabbit Convertible.

&gt;  it's a very cool not very expensive tool which I have used, but don't 
&gt;have ;)
&gt;  do a search at snapon for  piston ring expander, basically it makes it
&gt;  real easy to remove and install rings, it kinda squezes a handle which
&gt;  expands the rings for you to take them easily off the piston.

&gt;One of the few times that Snap-on is not better :)
&gt;
&gt;This Lisle tool works great and it is cheap!
