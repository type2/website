Subject: Re: [T2] Engine options

&gt; What engine came standard in a 1973 bus delivered to
&gt; the US?  Was it a 1700 FI?  From the information I
&gt; have, it did, but I've been wrong many times before.
&gt; Also, would it matter if it was manual or automatic?
&gt; Just wondering...

1700, 2 carbs.
FI did not arrive until 74, and then it was only on the California 1800
w/auto trans. 75 all states/all trans got FI.
