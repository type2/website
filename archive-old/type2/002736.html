Tim/List,

Where do you connect your CHT gauge?

On your 71 is your CHT gauge connected under the # 3 spark plug or somewhere
else on the head?  Connecting it under the # 3 plug *as the directions
suggest* is such a PITA, and I destroyed one coupler trying to get it to
work that way.

Where would you advise as the best place to connect it?

&gt; &gt;  VDO makes an oil temp sender that takes the place of the plug for the
oil-
&gt; &gt; pressure relief valve that fits on the underside of the case near the
&gt; pulley,
&gt; &gt; on a type 1 motor.  This is a good location because it senses the temp
of
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; oil that's headed to the main bearings.
&gt;
&gt; A few years ago I ran an oil temp sender in the oil pressure relief valve
&gt; location that you suggest.  At the same time I had a thermocouple attached
to
&gt; one of the case bolts.  The readings I got from the two locations were
&gt; identical.  Both in temperature and the time it took to get to that
&gt; temperature.
&gt; If you want to know what your oil temp is the &quot;plug for the oil pressure
&gt; relief valve&quot; location will not tell you.
&gt; If you want to know your oil temp on a type 1 engine use a dip stick
sender.
&gt; I'm not sure what senders are available for the type 4 engine.  If I were
&gt; doing it I'd use the round cover plate at the rear of the engine as my
access
&gt; point and install a sender that extends at least 2 inches into the oil.
The
&gt; issue is that the case runs at least 20 degrees cooler than the oil and
takes
&gt; much longer to heat up.
&gt; If you screw a metal sender into the case and the sender isn't really well
&gt; thermally isolated from the case you will read the case temperature.
Metal
&gt; conducts heat much better than oil.
&gt; The best way to know how hot your engine is getting is a CHT gauge.  On
the
&gt; type 4 engine you can cut off the big circle on the sender and wedge
what's
&gt; left between two fins near the spark plug.  It's not difficult and will
give
&gt; you useful information instead of vague indications.  Vague indications,
&gt; however are better than nothing.  But if your going to the trouble of
&gt; installing a temp gauge, why not install one that gives good information?
