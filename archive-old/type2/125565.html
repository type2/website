Subject: Re: [T2] insulation

I was just at Wesco (major auto-paint store in the area) today, and I was looking at their sound deadening pads. They were fibreglass re-inforced, about 1/8th inch thick, and were supposed to be moldable with heat. I asked the saleman about it, and he said that the BEST stuff to get was Dynamat. It's at www.dynamat_dot_com and it's used by car stereo people, so it must be pretty good. If your just looking for sound proofing.

I do believe that the best places to put that stuff for road noise is right above/around the wheel wells. Also, I read an article YEARS ago, that suggested removing all of your interior body panels,and spraying in that expandable foam stuff (bout five bucks a can at home depot, need about 2 cans per door size area), then replacing your panels. 

Just my two cents
Chris


&lt;&lt;I want to insulate to inside of our bus engine compartment.
