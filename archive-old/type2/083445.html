&gt; Nothing will be more functional than the very high spec stock  tires,
&gt; 185-R14C, Load Range C or D. If the 14 on the side wall isn't immediately
&gt; followed by a big C, (which stands for 'Commercial', ie sidewalls like on a
&gt; Peterbuilt), it's not spec. These are provided in either load range C or
&gt; load range D.

I was under the impression that the &quot;C&quot; suffix was a european designation
for a reinforced commercial tire, while the &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; ratings were
american load ratings that meant pretty much the same thing.  I've never
seen both designations on the same tire (which does not mean that it
doesn't exist!)
