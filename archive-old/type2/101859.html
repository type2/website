Subject: Re: [T2] tire pressure in '71

&gt;No, but if the tire size is the same, then the pressures in the manual or
&gt;on the data plate are far better than the maximums.  In most buses the
&gt;front wheels are more lightly loaded than the rears and need considerably
&gt;less pressure.  Load range D tires are rated for 60PSI, but there's no way
&gt;that you want to run that much on a bus!

Sometimes the tire pressures are labelled on the steering column between the dash and the wheel. These are the max inflation values although that fact is not labelled sometimes.

The Bentley is another good source but there has been some confusion on the list in the past concerning the correct pressure for campers because around 1971 the tires changed from bias ply to radial and the Bentley recommendations diverged: a reinforced tire for campers and a commerical tire for the other body types.

This is what the late model manual says and I think it should apply to all bay window campers:

Given all this, the label on my steering column states the tire pressures for both types of tires like the manual so I think it's ok to pick either, just follow the adhere to the pressures recommendations for each and don't exceed the max inflation values printed on the sidewall.
