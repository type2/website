Hello list-
   I've got a '71 Adventure Camper highroof that needs brake work.  
Unfortunately, the calipers appear to be very rusty and the rotors are too 
thin to turn.  I have a few later model parts buses and was wondering if 
anyone has done a swap from the 71-72 brakes to the 73-79 brakes?  I don't 
want to spend a mint on this, as I'm just putting it on the road to sell, 
but if anyone has experiance with this, could you tell me how far I have to 
go?  Are the spindles the same or do I need to change them also? Thanks
Joe
