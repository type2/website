&gt;I've never been there, but this place looks cool: http://www.busbones_dot_com/

Kevin Murray's shop.  To be fair to those who weren't happy with Kevin a couple of years ago, check the archives (and don't gripe at me, please :).  I've camped 
with Kevin a few times and hung out with him at shows.  Nice, funny, knowledgeable guy.  He's been in the biz for several years.

&gt;There are a couple of VW places in Gainesville. 
&gt;One guys advertises on ep_dot_com or aircooled
&gt;buy&amp;sell all the time, parting or selling busses
&gt;for cheap.  

That's probably David whose-last-name-I-forget at the Bug Junction.  Another pleasant guy.
