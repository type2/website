Yeah, boy, those brakes can last a looooong time, then sit for years. No
wonder they get persnickity about being separated from their bond. I have
an 10 pound hammer made from a 3&quot; diameter bronze propeller shaft from a
BIG ship. I hardly ever use it to pound with. I just set it in the vicinity
for effect, then tap off the drum with a 5 pound hammer. If they know you
mean business, it takes the fight right out of them.

&gt;A great feeling of satisfaction to get the second brake drum off the '72.

&gt;Much (and I do mean MUCH) banking with a 3 lb hammer, and a lot verbal abuse 
&gt;(man, it was the wife yelling about all the noise at 10 PM last night) and 
&gt;it finally came off.
