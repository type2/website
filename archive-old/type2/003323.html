Ok I will quite bugging you folks soon, I hope. The saga over the 72 Westy
continues. Part of my research has been asking folks their opinions on the
72 bus. For the most part it has been spoken of negatively, lack of access
to the engine, bad year for rust, first pancake engine, ect.
So why do I want to talk to 72 owners, because I want to know how you like
your bus? What should I be afraid of? What do you like about it? I know
these might seam like repetitive questions, but I like as many DETAILS as I
can get, and yes I OVERANALYZE everything, made to many mistakes in the
past. In fact we have 5 vehicles right now, 2 being projects, I don't need
another project. :-) We got sucked into this bus by accident, walked past it
for two years, never looked at it cause it wasn't a split and is painted
like a big black and white cow, surface rust everywhere. However when you
open the doors you realize how nice of a westy this bus is, immaculate metal
on the inside, no rust, all westy stuff accounted for, 61,000 original
miles, clean uncraked dash, outside NO wreck areas, straight sheet metal,
dog legs perfect, rockers perfect, corners perfect. Bad engine, unknown
electrical, unknown transmission, gas cap off gas tank, surface rust and
some heavy pit rust, needs new tires.
If you have made it this far, thank you...So does this bus sound like it is
worth $800. to you 72 owners? Will it be worth the estimated $3,000 to
whatever dollars it will take to get it road worthy ? I think we would keep
this westy for quite a while so the money would be considered a long term
investment. Any how, if you want to respond I would appreciate all opinions.
