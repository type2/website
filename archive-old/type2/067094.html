hey now,

if you want GOOD fresh seafood and will be in the tampa bay area, go to st.
petersburg and check out Skipper's Smokehouse. best seafood i've ever had.
went there when i was in tampa for a dead show. hmm, i'd go back just for the
seafood...but they have good local bands there and the best strawberry daquiris
i've had....
