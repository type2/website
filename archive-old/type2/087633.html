Now I'm not going there...

Volks I was serious BTW, on my first bus (dad's old '76) after I had
had it apart for about 5 years, in order to put the dash wiring back
together I bought a '75 for $50 to use as a model for the physical and
electrical reassembly.  Now strictly you don't need it, for instance
when the '70 single cab's fuse box ended up cracked (go figure) and
impossible to find (the 1? year 411 fuse box) I just took it all off and
rewired it on a nice late box (probably the one from that '75 actually.)
A little common sense and the color wiring diagrams scanned on
vintagebus will go a heck of a long way, but having another bus
sitting right there sure does help, and may not be such a bad idea
if you get a ruster and pull the tranny and driveshafts, and anything
else appropriate.  Of course even from that '75 to '76 there were a
number of differences....
