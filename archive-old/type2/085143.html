Subject: Re: [T2]  Rear Swaybar Question

The 1st reference is to the temper, etc., of a home made swaybar as suggested by Jim Arnott.

The 2nd reference is to a broken original VW bus front swaybar, and my attempts to make something useful from the broken pieces.

---------------------------------------

&gt;I'm confused:

&gt;&gt;Interesting idea.  I'm a bit skeptical about the temper or &quot;springiness&quot;
&gt;&gt;of the resulting part.

&gt;and then:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Repeated heatings
&gt;&gt;to bright red hot have had no apparent effect on its original temper.
&gt;&gt;Files hardly leave a mark, and I did much damage to a good quality
&gt;&gt;grinding wheel while trying to tidy up one of the jagged broken ends
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Doesn't these two statements conflict with each other?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Ciao!
