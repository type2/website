Subject: Exhaust system suggestions
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SUN.3.96.990713235105.20341A-100000_at_grex.cyberspace_dot_org&gt;

I'm looking for any suggestions with regards to the exhaust system on my
'75 van.  The pipes are mostly in good shape, but the flanges are all
trash...the ones on the manifold ends of the U-pipes and on the manifolds
themselves are eroded almost back to the edges of the pipes, with only
1/8&quot; or so of sealing surface left.  Needless to say, no matter how much
filing and banging I do, it leaks.  The flanges at the heat exchangers are
slightly better, but only slightly; someone welded new flanges on, at some
point, and holes are starting to burn through the welds.  Oh yeah, the
muffler's rusting out, too.  Obviously the ideal solution would be to
replace everything, but from the looks up it I'd be out upwards of $600.
Any other suggestions?  Local exhaust shops don't seem to want to touch 
it, and I don't blame them.  I'm beginning to envy the complete 'extractor
systems' available for tha 1600 engines...wish someone made something like
that for the Type IV.  I have a gas heater, so I don't even use the heat
exchangers.
