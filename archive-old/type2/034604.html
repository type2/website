Subject: Re: Catalogues and Magazines?

&gt; Can someone recommend some catalogues that cater to just busses and
campers?
&gt;

I recommend getting a free catalog from www.vwcalimports_dot_com. When I got my
bus, I went around to all the VW sites I could find that had bus parts and
ordered their catalogs, this is one of my favorite catalogs I got. It has
tons of stuff and pictures for most everything in it. You can also download
the catalog from their site if you wish.

Although some don't like them, I would also recommend getting a VW catalog
from www.jcwhitney_dot_com. They tend to have some pretty good prices and
selection and pictures for just about everything. They also seem to be
carrying some better brands now, like bugpack.

Many of the places I got catalogs from didn't have full catalogs, just some
of their major items. Some were nothing more than a large price sheet with
no pictures. I find that the pictures help out a lot, for both ordering the
correct part and for comparing old parts. I don't think I have seen a bus
*only* catalog yet. I mean, so many parts fit other models, why limit their
customer base to a single model only?
