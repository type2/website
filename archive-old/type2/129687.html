Subject: RE: [T2] Used Rotor question - steel prices

An individual rotor would cost more to take to the recycler than they would pay you BUT certainly toss it in the recycle bin all the same. 

I was surprised to find out this week that steel prices have surged. In 1998 I scrapped a '74 Westy and minus the drivetrain - it brought less than $20. Comapct sedans are now selling at nearly $100. Apaprently China is buying scrap left and right. They are (I'm told) doing alot of infrastructure projects and of course making everything under the sun right now to sell at Wal-Mart worldwide... &lt;griN!&gt;
