&lt;&lt; I am looking to replace this fan, but I am curious if anyone has used a
 larger fan here (in order to assist with heating the Bus interior and
 cooling the engine)?  Would a larger fan be too much of a strain on the
 electrical
 system?  Is this small electrical fan very effective at all?
 
 Thanks for the help,

My fan works, but I've also been thinking that a bigger fan would work 
better.  Maybe one with two speeds.  
Anybody tried it?
