Subject: Re: Free brae rotors

&gt;I got a set of front brake stuff at the last Bugout.
&gt;Part of the score was a pair of used, never cut front 
&gt;rotors. I was told that they were for '71-72 busses.
&gt;But, they are not. They are the '73-'79 style rotors.
&gt;The offset is just a little off from the ones I need,
&gt;but they dont fit. I even cleaned, trued, and painted
&gt;the pair.

Well, they went quickly. Charlie Ford needs them for the 
mothership.

Is that the same Mothership that George Clinton and the
Funkadelics use?
