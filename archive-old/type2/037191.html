haven't actually done it but sure have played with enough auto trannies.

I don't think there are major problems with switching a newer auto tranny
into an older bus, vice versa yes it would be difficult.

if at all possible get the shifter from the front of the bus, they are
different.

the shift detents are on the shifter in the older tranny's the shift
detents are in the tranny for the newer ones' so you would have to be
carefull that the front shifter isn't holding the transmission part way in
or out of gear.

  the later tranny uses a &quot;Govenor&quot; shifter so you would have to block off
the vacuum line for the vacuum shifter.

the later auto tranny is much more robust and parts are (sort of)still
avaliable


Good luck
