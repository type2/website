Subject: Transaxle Drive Flanges

As I began the replacement of a torn CV joint boot on my 1968 bus, I
noticed some non-rotational play when I wiggled the drive flange.  At
first I thought the differential bearings might be shot but after
checking a blowup diagram, I saw that the flange rides on a splined
shaft which is part of the differential.  Is some play between the
differential shaft and the drive flange normal?  I checked the other
side and it seemed a little tighter but still had some side movement. 
This tranny drives &amp; shifts just fine, doesn't make any howling or
whining noises, but has apparently been leaking for quite a while (I'm
the new owner of the bus).  Will I be able to see or feel the splined
shaft when I remove the CV joint?  Any helpful input will be
appreciated.

Thanks, DC - Manhattan Beach
