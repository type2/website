Subject: [T2] Help with finding an exhaust system

Hi all, first time posting to the list...

I just built a 2270 and am strangely hard pressed to find a good exhaust for
it.  THis is for a 72-74 heater box setup.  Basically, I want a quiet
exhaust that flows -- and I can't believe they don't exist!  I would love to
have something off the shelf since I don't weld and don't want to.  Stingers
are out of the question. 

Does anyone have any leads for a 72-74 exhaust that flows?  Something bolt
on and go...

Thanks,
Steve
