Subject: Fuel tank compatability

Hello All

I recently had someone down at my place pulling stuff of my parts bus to
buy.  He has a 73, mine is a 70.  He was interested in the fuel tank but
I had no idea if it would fit.  None of the catalogs I have list the 73
tank.  And at bus depot they are listed as having different sending
units

Does anyone know what this tank will fit into?

Thanks
Brent
