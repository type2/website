Subject: Re: [T2] Aftermarkey wheels for a Bay

The REAL answer here is a 5-spd tranny.....

This would get the rpm's down on the freeway....just like you wanted....

Collie

&gt; This is true, but my concern is to keep the rpms down for cooling puposes.
&gt; I have a 1904cc in my '71 that was built for torque. I have been
&gt; experimentingt with the rpms and reading the temperature and found that my
&gt; engine runs cooler at 3200 rpms.  I would like to reduce the rpms for
&gt; cruizing on the highway to keep the engine cooler. Currently, the rpms are
&gt; 3750 at 65 mph which IMHO is too high.  I would like to get it down to 3200
&gt; at 65 mph but this will take more that changing tire sizes.
