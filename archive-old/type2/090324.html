Subject: Re: [T2] Electronic ignition and a melted lollipop (fwd)

Beth, Jon, Gregg,

I am rolling!  Very funny!!!  I am glad it has worked out as well as it
did :-)  I hope to see you all at High Country!!!

&gt;   &gt; Ok, my four year old daughter left a lollipop on the front passenger
&gt;   &gt; seat of my 78 bus and it melted into the cloth upholstery.  True, it is
&gt;   &gt; my fault; I should not have given her the lolli, but these seats are new
&gt;   &gt; to me, given to me at Everybus 2002 by some nice guy whose name I
&gt;   &gt; forget, and I want to get this junk off my seat!  Any suggestions?

Beth,

It is *very* easy to get the cover off the seat and soak it.  It also
washes in a machine quite well with no detectable shrinkage  Getting the
sugar out of the foam/horshair may be worse (*don't* soap the horsehair
(if you have any left)), but it is sugar, and thus water soluble.

                           Steve Dolan
