Subject: 71 Kombi for sale in Ralieigh

This is from an Australian that started in Canada, bought a bus and has toured
the entire US.  She is getting ready to travel on without the bus and is
looking to sell.  Following is a description from her.  If you want an more
info please email her at spacecakecookie_at_hotmail_dot_com her name is Rebecca.  Or
you can call her at 919 781 0616.

This is all I know.

1971 Kombi asking $1700, with a 1700 engine that was put in by the previous
owner, we did work on the brakes so she is running like a champ. bench seat in
the back folds out to a bed , a pop up table and some storage cupboards are
the only features to speak of so there is lots of room in the back (ideal for
musicians especially with drums or keyboards...) and there is also a new
radio/cassette deck with an inlet for CD. I think that is a real selling
point, not sure if everyone else does??! it needs a few little things done to
it - for example I bought a new speedo cable but the speedo still doesn't work
so I think I have to replace that nut that connects the cable to the wheel -
small job I thought I would leave for the next VW companion ( I heard it is
politically incorrect here to call yourself an &quot;owner&quot; of a VW!!) and the roof
in the middle of the bus is collapsing slightly! and of course there is a
little rust under the windscreen and over the wheels (just for personality of
course!)
thanks again for your help.
Rebecca
