Subject: Anti-roll/Sway bar mounting

All,

I need to change the anti-roll bar mountings on my bus (rusted through) and
I was wondering if anyone has any hints they would like to share.  Haynes
has about 2 sentences on the subject, I don't have Bentley, there is nothing
in the type2_dot_com library and the archives aren't working properly.
Is it easier with the wheels on the ground or not?  etc...
