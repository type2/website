Hi All,
Hope I do okay here, this is my first question as a &quot;newby&quot;.
I recently purchased my '75 Westy &quot;Sparky&quot; and the brake light on the
dash has been on since day one. Yesterday I took it to a shop to have it
checked out and they found that both of my rear master cylinders were
leaking. So they replaced all the problems BUT that darn light is still
on! Brakes are working okay except for a few squeeks. My service manual
says that it is a serious problem that should be dealt with imediately.
The Brake Tech is stumped. It is going back on Friday for another check.
Any suggestions? Is there a switch that needs to be reset? If so where?
