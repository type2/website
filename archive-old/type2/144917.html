Subject: 1/2 ton of parts for sale (give or take) - CHEAP!

I have a shed full of parts for sale. One low low
price of $300 gets it all. Includes rebuildable 2.0
engine core, most of the parts are still on it.
Complete fuel injection system. Alternators, starters,
engine tin, rubber, two tables (77 rear, unknown year
for the front), childs cot etc. Need to get rid of
ASAP!

1972 transporter with huge sunroof for $1200. Runs OK
but is sucking a valve. Dual carb. Has had all of the
rusted out holes repaired with new steel welded in.
Very little filler. I have pics of all the repairs -
before and after.

Also a 1970 Karmann Ghia w/sunroof. Complete new
interior. New sunroof. Semi-auto. Needs work. Almost
new engine (less than 2000 miles on factory rebuild).
$3000

Call 240.893.8441 if interested.

Peace,
Maui Haui (Mowie Howie)
