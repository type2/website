Subject: Re: TDC &amp; BRAKES

When I first got my bus the passenger side plate was missing, so I &quot;fabricated&quot; one out of one of my dad's garbage can lids.  He was a little upset, but i needed the metal.  It's nice though.  Has a little handle on it, so you can pull yourself out on the creeper.  Real nifty.  I just had to mentally reverse the pattern of the driver's side plate.  It stays in there, and that's all that matters.  I think one of them fell down and dragged home on the way to woodstock, but that's all the problems I've
had.

    Oh, and working on my bus this weekend has given me new respect for the rust that encompasses the lower portion of the great beast.  If there was no rust, I would have nowhere to hook my trouble light.  Woo hoo for rust holes.

&gt; Save those plates! They're impossible to find. I pick them up when I see
&gt; them at junkyards, and I know have a collection of exactly one (besides
&gt; the two Steve got with the 78 exhaust he yanked).
