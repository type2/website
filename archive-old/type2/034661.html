&gt; going again. The only thing left was to pull the tank. My 79 has no
&gt; removable bottom outlet.
&gt; 
&gt; Inside was a piece of newspaper.  It was I imagine getting sucked over the
&gt; outlet and blocking it off but floating free after a while.

What I want to know is why you put newspapers in your fuel???    seriously
how the heck did that get in there?????

&gt; If you start messing around with fuel lines please for God's sake be
&gt; extremely cautious about dripping fuel. There was a guy in our village
&gt; burned to death when working on his camper a couple of years back.

don't think this can be repeated often enough
