&gt;&gt; Bob, even if you don't use head gaskets, you have to compensate by using
&gt;&gt; barrel shims between the cylinders and the case.  The FAQ gives information
&gt;&gt; on this.  Link, anybody??
&gt; 
&gt; been running about 10 years with neither.  I do have them though.

eeek.. well, unless you like running a higher compression ratio, that 
might be why you were dropping seats?  Any particular reason why you 
didn't use them?

&gt; no I haven't and it is #1 causing the problem not #3  which was fine
&gt; before I started, I had a dropped seat on both 3 &amp;4 both intake too. so
&gt; while engine was out and stripped &quot;Why not do both heads&quot; (outsmart self)
&gt; if I cannot get a decent seal with a gasket installed I will reinstall the
&gt; old head.

why not take off the head and cylinders and lap the cylinders into the 
head so you *know* you have a good seal.  While it's a mild pain to get 
the cylinders off, it might make things easier in the long run.

Also, a quick way to see if you have some kind of seal would be the 
prussian blue, or just draw with a sharpie on the cylinder and rotate it 
a small bit and see if it wipes off on the head.

Also, when you have your head off, pour some liquid into the intake and 
also into the exhaust (one at a time, of course) and see if it holds it 
without leaking through the valve.

good luck!
Mike
