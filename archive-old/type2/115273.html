Subject: '80 Vanagon Bumpers - Virginia area

'80 Vanagon Westy has perfect front bumper, and excelent rear bumper. 
Chrome, endcaps and impact strips = (near) perfect.  Rear bumper has minor 
'waves' what looks like someone stood on the top of the bumper.

Anyone know how to take the front bumper off!!!

I had to leave them.  Sad.


The junk yard says $40 each.

(PMail me if you are NOVA for info on where this beauty is!!)

The rest of the story..

I called the PO and the Previous PO.  The '80's name is 'Chuck&quot;.  PO talked 
with me for 20 minutes, and drove to the junk yard on Sunday to load my '78 
up with tons of new parts and tools.  FREE  !!

The list is too much to put here.  Some stuff from Bus Depot (still has 
receipts)  But most amazing, he gave me a Vanagon backing plate.  NEW.  And 
everything on it is NEW!!!  Like the self adjuster, the springs, the 
emergency brake cable, etc.  It sure looks pretty.  But I only got one...

I pulled the Vanagon tires/wheels for $88 plus taxes. Michelin MXT with 
1,000 miles on them.  Also got a mosquito net (Vanagon - I don't need) and a 
one-of-a-kind locking H2O input latch. No, Phil C, not the plug that you 
remove with a key, but the flap itself has a special key to open.


Anyone want the bumpers??  Please, don't clog the list.  PMail me for info / 
directions. Northern Virginia.
