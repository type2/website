&gt;The clutch problem.
&gt;I would first pull out the cable and inspect it just to be sure.
&gt;If you take off the wingnut you can pull it out through the front without
&gt;taking it off the pedal. If its ok just regrease it and push it back in.
&gt;If the cable is bad, thats good. If its good thats not so good as it will
&gt;probably be the throwout arm or the pressure plate and either is going to
&gt;require an engine pull.
If the cable is not the problem, just check the lever on the transmission
the cable attaches to before pulling the engine.
I had this on my bus a while ago, the cable was fine, but there was a hair
line fracture in the lever, so it was slipping on the spline rather than
turning the shaft the throw out bearing sits on. I was very difficult to
see, and I unfortunately pulled the engine to discover this.
