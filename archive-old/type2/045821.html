Subject: Re: [T2] battery to choose?

Peripheral note: The hold-down clamp that bolted down the inner bottom
edge of the battery to the floor of the compartment was gone on mine.
You can get a generic doo-dad at the FLAPS that replaces that piece
perfectly. It's in a package with two small red coated metal pieces that
are specifically made for holding batteries down. You only need one of
the pieces.

Of course, this only applies if your battery compartment floor is
somewhat rust-free. :-)

Also, I noticed that in the Help! section of my FLAPS there is a
&quot;Starter Solenoid Heat Shield&quot; (aka curvy metal plate). Wasn't there a
thread on just such a thing recently?
