This reply to my original post, which found its way over to the virtual
vairs list, says it all, Ed Corson is a corvair master and knows what he is
talking about, if you think corvair parts are hard to find I guess you
didnt read my original post , they are all over and not expensive..some one
mentioned about sealing the engine compartment properly...all I have to say
is if you cant fabricate a seal for this conversion then you have no
buisness doing the conversion, also the reason I went through an engine a
year is because I drive 86 miles a day, 6 days a week to work over a 3,000
foot high moutain range, and it ate V.W. engines alive, with this
conversion it has been reliable for 8 years.

       I am not flaming volkswagons engines, I love my bus but for me this
conversion is awesome.

                              read below.............thanks......Keith

&gt;  &gt;I looked very closely at installing one of these kits, but decided
against
&gt;  &gt;it for several reasons. One of which had to do with sealing the engine
&gt;  &gt;compartment. 
&gt; 
&gt; You can use the original Vair seal or make a custom seal out of
rubberized
&gt; vinyl strips like used in aircraft engine compartments.
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt;Reason number two: Corvair engines are indeed low stressed, but far
from
&gt;  &gt;what the original post would have you believe, they are not common.
Parts
&gt;  &gt;are very expensive, getting more so all the time, and exceedingly rare.

&gt;  &gt;Try finding a fan belt or plugs for your
&gt;  &gt;Volksvair at the local FLAPS. If you thought VWs were a novelty, wait
until
&gt;  &gt;you mention the word &quot;Corvair.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know about the rest of the country but around Southern Calif. and
the
&gt; rest of the Southwest Vair engines are readily available and if you will
&gt; invest 
&gt; in a Calrk's or Underground catalog you will see how available the parts
are 
&gt; and at very inexpensive prices.  As for sparkplugs, if you can find them
for
&gt; your VW engine you have found them for your Vair.  They use the same
plugs.
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt;I plan to drive my rebuilt VW van, complete with its rebuilt VW engine,
as
&gt;  &gt;far as the road will take me. That means into other countries where
they
&gt;  &gt;didn't have no stinkin' Corvairs. Ubiquity is part of the beauty of the
&gt;  &gt;VW--throw a rod in Argentina and you'll find five guys selling them
from
&gt;  &gt;donkey carts on the side of the road.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, you can't drive anything to Argentina from here.  And if you ship
&gt; your Vair powered buss there you will find that it will not throw a rod
or
&gt; anything else if it was properly built in the first place.
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt;Yes, we'd all like to have 110 HP. But I think the days when it was
&gt;  &gt;practical to drop a Vair in a Volks ended about 1982. My two cents.
&gt;  &gt;Bob
&gt; 
&gt; I have built over 20 of these conversions and shipped them to Indonesia
&gt; for installation in VW busses, all after 82, and they have no trouble
with
&gt; them and no trouble finding service parts.  I'll take your two cents and
&gt; here is your change.
