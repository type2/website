Subject: Re: transmission problem: help?

It doesn't sound like a transmission problem.. It sounds like your shift
linkage is just out of adjustment. If you don't want to mess with it
yourself using a manual, a shop should be able to adjust it (and replace
bushings if necessary) for around $50. I had the same problem in my 81
Vanagon.
