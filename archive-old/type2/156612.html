No argument from me.  We have a Scion xB that cost about $15K.  However,
our decision to buy a New Bus from VW will have more to do with its
usefulness as a vehicle than with its resemblence to a nostalgia vehicle.
It will also have a lot to do with VW improving their reputation for
reliability.

I'd kill for a current production Brazilian bus.  However, 95% of current
US buyers would think that that vehicle is crude.  Tastes have changed,
but unfortunately I haven't.
