Subject: Compufire

I just thought I'd post my thoughts so far on the Compu-Fire ignition 
replacement.  I just purchased one from aircooled_dot_net and delivery was 
quick.  I took the day yesterday to install it and it was very 
straighforward.  Take old points and condensor off and install the 
module and magnet disk.  I did have to shorten my rotor by a 1/4 of an 
inch but that was easy with the disk sander.  It runs really nice! 
Definately blows away points.

I chose the compufire module over the pertronix because I've heard about 
problems with the pertronix failing (both on this list and on the 
aircooled_dot_net site) and also because there no gap adjustment or anything 
like that.  Anyways, it seems like a cool upgrade.  I'll letcha know if 
I ever encounter any problems...

later,
Mike
