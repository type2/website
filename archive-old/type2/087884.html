I know we're not supposed to &quot;advertise&quot; eBay items, so I didn't mention =
this one until it was already gone.. The only reason that I'm bringing =
it up is to point out that there are still a few nice, affordable, =
running buses out there. Some newbies had lamented and feared no more =
could be had. Watch eBay.=20

This sure looked like a good one for a fair price. Jan B
