 Steve:
 
 One of us here at Bus Boys had the same problem with his 73 Bug a few
years
 ago.  We finally traced the problem to the alternator (or in your case the
 generator)  It was the original alternator and it still charged the
system,
 but the armature shaft that rode in the bearings had pounded out of round
 (much like a crankshaft in a very high milage engine). Replacing the
 alternator solved the rattle.  This is one thing you might want to look
 into.
 
 Thank you!
