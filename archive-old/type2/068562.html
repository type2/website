&gt;       I currently have a Type 1 engine in my 72 bus.  I have obtained a 
&gt;complete type II engine, but I have know idea of the condition of this engine. 
&gt; I would like to rebuild it, so that I have a known reliable engine.  If any 
&gt;list members have any insight as to where to buy parts, I would like to know.  
&gt;I would like to get a complete kit with all the necessary parts to do this 
&gt;rebuild. 
&gt;       What should I do first?  What should I look for to let me know if the 
&gt;engine can even be rebuild.  So far, all I know is that I can turn the 
&gt;alternator belt, and the crank pulley will turn.  I don't know if this is a 
&gt;1700 or 1800 or whatever.  How can I tell?  It have been modified to that a 
&gt;single carburator.  BTY, I got this engine free, but I really want a bus 
&gt;engine, not a van engine in willie. 
&gt;       Any help and advice would be wonderful.

Hi Stewart,

a little help... First, get the Muir book, &quot;How to Keep Your Volks-
Wagen Alive&quot;.  You can check your engine number by looking at the
stand the alternator/generator sits on.  It faces rear and should
have something like   AE nnn nnn nn  or something on it.  (the 'n's
stand for numbers.  You can write it down and post it to this list,
if nothing else.  Many here have detailed info on when that engine
was built, etc.  

As for rebuilding it, itza BIG job, and I would try to run it
first to get an idea how it is. But if you do it, (Muir and Bentley
books), you'll have a lot of satisfaction and a lot of happy miles !!

Have Fun,

- -John Austin
