Now rotate your engine clockwise from '0 TDC' and that's ATDC.  As in,
anything happening at this time is After you engine has reached TDC -
aka ATDC.

Hopefully THIS will make some sense to anyone who needs the info. 


I agree with Mike

Put a timing light on your engine and watch the mark move.  Mine 
_always_travels counter clockwise (to the left) as the engine is revved.
 
This works for people who agree that flyweights and vacuum cans
cause the spark to advance.  That advance means firing the plug
sooner.  That firing the plug sooner means BEFORE TDC.  

Finally, we all have to agree which is left and which is right.

That might mean we will never come to complete agreement on 
this question.
