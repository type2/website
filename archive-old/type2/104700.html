Subject: Re: [T2] side marker lens

My set is as good as new. They were from Bus Depot about 2 years ago. The 
bus has sat on the car port (sunny side of the house) since then and still 
now fade from the lenses.

One of these days I'll take the lenses out of the box and install them on 
that bus sitting outside... &lt;grin&gt;

Sorry - couldn't help it...

Suggestion: go to a neon or sign shop and ask them to recommend a good 
brand of transparent paint. There is such a thing. Spray or brush the 
inside of your lenses.

I'd test it first in varying coat thicknesses though on a piece of glass to 
see how much it blocks the lighting.

When you find a good brand - please share. I have a lense I want to do for 
my Beetle in about 5 years when I start that project...

Hope this helped.
