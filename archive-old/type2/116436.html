Subject: RE: [VB] RE: [T2] Tailgaters

If possible I move to the shoulder and flip them the peace sign....one of
the top gratifications for me driving my Bus is no matter what, I can't be
in a hurry, nice feeling in today's world. Funny, but look at the people who
zoom past, they all seem angry at the world.
