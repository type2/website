&gt;&gt; You can repair the old injector.  I used a electrical wire cutter to cut
&gt;&gt; off the metal swage ring, then pulled off the old hose.  Just use a clamp
&gt;&gt; when you install the new piece of hose.  Replace all the hoses if they are
&gt;&gt; just as old as the one that is leaking.  Use the OE style clamps if you
&gt;&gt; can.  The regular plumbing style worm clamps often cut into the hose at the
&gt;&gt; base of the worm mechanism, weakening the hose and causing new leaks.


Mike:

The plumber's style clamp has the worm screw housing crimped onto the band
part of the clamp with a short section of the band extending out from the
crimp on the bottom side of the housing (follow me?).  This short section
of band comes in contact with the hose and tends to dig into the hose when
you tighten the clamp.

The OEM style clamps won't do this.  They use a nut and bolt to draw the
band thghtly together in such a way that the band won't dig into the hose.
You can get them at your local VW dealer, but they are quite proud of them
and therefore charge you for that.  IMHO, its worth the extra bucks in
order to reduce the risk of a high pressure fuel leak.

Hope this helps.
