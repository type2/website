Subject: RTV silicone on sunroof

The sky was blue and beautiful this morning, so I went out and bought two
tubes of RTV silicone for the sunroof, as suggested by West. By the time I
got home it was raining, so I'm waiting until I can find a friendly garage
... My original thought had been to just squirt the silicone all around the
sunroof while it was closed, just to stop the leaks. However, after reading
the card the silicone was packaged with, I realize that was not an
exceptionally intelligent idea, and that the way it should be done is to
open the sunroof and squirt the silicone where the old gasket was. What a
concept ... I looked at the old gasket -- or what is left of it -- and it
seems to be an empty (used to have foam?? in it???) piece of fabric on the
car-part-of-the-opening instead of on the sunroof itself. So, what is it
exactly I am supposed to do? Any help will be appreciated.

Love, Lotus (Flower of the North)
