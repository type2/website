Subject: Re: [T2] Help with buying brass drift for wheel bearing race

&gt; Thanks for replying!  I just want to be careful with the hub more than
&gt; with the old races.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't want to score the hub where the new bearing seats.

A perfect use for a brass drift. Pick up a set.

Many Sears items like those Mayhew drifts are a bargain because Sears buys
in such large volume. You'll pay much for them in future when you need them
and can't find them at Sears.

A great tool for installing races is the Lisle 12600:

You can see it in action here. Drifts are nice it's really tricky work
getting the race perfectly true so the hub is exactly where it's supposed to
be.

&gt; Autozone...and they stock inner and outer Timken bearings

Good brand. Made in which country?
