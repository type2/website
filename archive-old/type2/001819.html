Subject: Axle boots
Date: Sun, 3 Sep 2000 18:39:15 -0500

I have an easy question. I'm replacing axle boots on my 1977 bus, the small
end of the boot is fastened by a metal clamp, I've used these in the past
but need reminding how to crimp them? The instructions are confusing and I
don't have any extras to practice with.
