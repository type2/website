Subject: 78 westy ?

hi,  I am reconstructing the heater fan and tubes on a 78 westy.  Are both
tubes from the auxiliary fan the round paper / foil type or is one
side(passenger) a plastic tube thing ?  Picked up the fan for $10 today at a u
pull it yard ....

Thanks!

Going to install the engine tomorrow, have cleaned, painted tin, replace all
seals, hoses, gas lines, installed a oil temp and pressure gauge, painted the
engine compartment white, installed two 12 volt lights with switches in the
engine compartment, removed and replaced the gas tank and all hoses, replaced
the pilot bearing, rear tranmission seal, replaced the battery boxes, so far.
hope to have it back on the road this week!  This list makes it possible!

thanks!
