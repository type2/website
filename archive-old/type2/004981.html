1971 Westy:  Turn signal switch is at best &quot;iffy&quot; as far as staying on when
you switch on the turn signals.  Most of the time it snaps right back after
you let go of it. I took it out of the housing yesterday and inspected it,
but this thing is a serious excercise in mechanical complexity.  I could not
determine what was worn and what might be done to make it work better.
Electrically, the switch works fine.  Any suggestions?
