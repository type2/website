Subject: '79 Heat Exchangers for sale

I have a good used pair of heat exchangers from a 1979 bus.  These are, I
believe, one year only parts.  There is some minor disintigration of the
outer casing where it meets the pipes, but they are in better than average
condition.  I would like $50 for the pair, and they are located in Dallas,
Tx.   I would prefer not to ship them but if someone far away really needs
them I could probably do it.
