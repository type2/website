Subject: Re: [T2] Am I sitting on a bulkhead bomb?

Hi Bill

the early buses didn't have that sheet metal panel between the engine and the
gas tank,, and I have seen some early Bays without it also, I dunno what year it
was installed for sure,

If you have one,, or can get one,, you could put it in,, but Unless someone
comes up with a serious problem with out it,, I don't think it matters,,, ymmv

But on the rag in the fan thing,, First thing I tell people who i see leaving a
oil rag in the engine compartment is the dangers of it getting caught in the
fan, and choking off the air intake, overheating,, etc!

My Rule of Thumb,, DON'T carry the oil rag in the engine compartment!  and if
you do put a screen over the fan intake,,, make it look like a french fry
basket, or a dome, a salad strainer,, not a FLAT screen,, cause the rag will
stick to the screen and cause the same misfortune.

&gt; When redoing my engine I noticed that my bus (1970) did  not have a
&gt; &quot;bulkhead&quot; between the engine compartment and the gas tank compartment like
&gt; is shown in the manuals.
&gt; 
&gt; Should I put a bulkhead in?
&gt; 
&gt; Also, a friend told me that his T2 engine once sucked up a rag from the
&gt; engine compartment.
&gt; 
&gt; Should I install a screen over the fan intake hole on the engine shroud?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
