Subject: ADMIN: Subscribers can post to both lists

Hello all!

This is a reminder that anyone that is subscribed to Type2 can post to
VintageBus and anyone that is subscribed to VintageBus can post to Type2.
This is done as a convenience to subscribers.  If you love your '72 Westy
but have a few questions about that '61 single-cab that's for sale down
the street, or if you have memorized the parts list for your '67 Deluxe
but can't find the carburetor on your friend's '78, then this feature is
for you!  A good way to see replies to your question without subscribing
is to use the Web interfaces at http://www.type2_dot_com/type2reflect/ and
http://www.type2_dot_com/vintagebusreflect/ .

Please note that the lists are moderated by two different sets of people
and the moderation standards are somewhat different.  Before posting to
the &quot;other&quot; list for the first time, take a moment to read the last few
days' worth of messages for that list on the Web interface to get a feel
for the difference.  If you find yourself posting many messages to the
&quot;other&quot; list, subscribing to it is probably a good idea.

Thanks!

Matt Roberds
One of the type2_dot_com admins, but not a moderator for either list
