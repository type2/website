I've used small vice grips, big screw drivers, and impact wrenches to remove
frozen engine tin screws.  What works best for me are Sears Craftsman mini
channel lock pliers.  

The pliers are tiny.  They look as though all you could do with them is pull
loose teeth.  They are much thinner than vice grips so you can get much
closer to perpendicular to the screw head.  They also don't damage the screw
the way vice grips have for me.  There's a channel lock position that's
perfect for engine tin screws.

&gt;&gt;you mean the engine tine screws, right?   use a big screwdriver, or vice
&gt;&gt;grips on the screw to loosen, or vice grips on the big screwdriver while
&gt;&gt;pushing the screwdriver to the screwhead.
&gt;
&gt;One thing I've had to do is use one of those hammer driven impact wrenches
&gt;with a screw driver bit on the end. It'll loosen up just about anything.
