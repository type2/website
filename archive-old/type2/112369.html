Subject: Re: [T2] How do you set up your camp?

Hi Ruth,

I find that containerizing things helps a lot in keeping things 
organized. Big plastic bins with tight-fitting lids are a godsend for 
this. You can also get low-profile bins that will slide under the bus 
when not in use and help keep the campsite uncluttered. I also use a 
custom made pine dish box that keeps a setting for 8 plus cutlery in 
one easy-to-reach location.

A door-mat is very handy, and I use it in the bus when traveling to 
stop the cooler from sliding around on our laminate floor.

With the rear screen in place and the jalousies open we get sufficient 
airflow, but I have thought about making magnetic front-window screens.

The best thing for rain is to bring the Blue Sky with you... I now own 
a HUGE custom 15x20 awning we call the &quot;Blue Sky&quot; that sets up quick 
and it's tall enough to park a bus underneath with the roof up if you 
wanted to. When taken down the poles ride in a carrier mounted on the 
jack posts and the connector brackets half-fill a milk crate.

The other indispensable item in my campsite setup is the westrailer. 
It's a small box trailer with a shortened bus pop-top that has an 
integrated kitchen with 10 square feet of countertop plus about 45 
cubic feet of storage space. This means we only need to keep the 
lunch/beverage cooler in the bus and all the other camping gear can be 
kept in the trailer. The bus stays a lot more organized with the 
westrailer following behind.

But you don't really need a lot of gadgets. Practice will improve your 
judgment on  what *really* needs to come with you on a trip and once 
you set a reasonable limit on your inventory, the rest of it will 
eventually take care of itself.

I couldn't get my own inventory under control, so I built the 
westrailer. Your milage may vary.

Happy trails,

&gt;&gt; What I'd like to hear about are ways you all keep your camper 
&gt;&gt; organized
&gt;&gt; while camping- We're getting good at putting stuff right away, but 
&gt;&gt; there has
&gt;&gt; to be more to keeping things organized.
&gt;&gt; Rain- what do you all do in the rain? We have a mat outside the door, 
&gt;&gt; and we
&gt;&gt; have to take our shoes off to keep the inside clean/dry. Any 
&gt;&gt; suggestions for
&gt;&gt; camping in the rain? PA has had an exceptionally wet summer this year.
