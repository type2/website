Subject: Re: [T2] Door latch interchange question

Chris,

I'm pretty sure most of the latch IS compatible, if nothing else, the
&quot;potmetal&quot; piece in the external handle that engages the latch IS, because I
poached it out of my '72 SC to fix my '75 driver's door ( they break and
it's not a part that you can buy, as far as I know. )

I'm pretty sure that the window winder for all Bays is the same model
number, and therefore should be a worthwhile spare, too.

Regards,

&gt; Are the latch mechanisms the same for an early Bay ('72) and a Late Bay
('78).

&gt; Getting ready to scrap a good early Bay door and want to know if it's
worth
&gt; the trouble to extract the latch.

&gt; How about the window lift?
