Subject: Re: [T2] air/fuel ratios for a 2.0L

Well, when you ran with carbs, what ratios were you looking at on the 
WBO2 meter?  David thinks 12.5:1 is good for WOT, would you agree with 
this number.

I have found that if I have too much decel I get bucking.  Others have 
said that some decel fuel cut also helps out with mpg.

I have a fully adjustable EFI, now I'm just looking for the numbers to 
fill it.  I unfortunately don't have engines to burn up, so I'm looking 
for the numbers from other people that have done the testing.  I would 
venture to guess that there's a good number (such as 12.5:1) that is a 
good compromise between power and heat.

Thanks,
Mike

&gt; Just my input: decel A/F is meaningless. I have tested extensively with a
&gt; $2k wideband on many vehicles, it's not uncommon to go to 70:1 during
&gt; decelleration. Idle, cruise, and power are what matter. I can not give any
&gt; input on these for a T-2, my only experiences are with Carbs or Digifant,
&gt; with the Wideband.

&gt;&gt;If I were you, I would tune for 12.5 at WOT, 14.7 at cruise and
&gt;&gt;decel.  Maybe a bit leaner at decel.  That will give you a pretty good
&gt;&gt;compromise for power, emissions and engine life.
