Subject: Strangely rich running???
Message-ID: &lt;0.255d7a00.253e9a4a_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Something very strange happened to me (my bus) today. Its a 79 2000cc FI 
stock engine.
   I drove home from school; i have about 400 miles on new pistons and rings. 
It has been running great. When i put the engine back in i left off all the 
heater accesories and the rubber/ foam seal that wraps all the way around the 
engine. Today i decided to put this stuff on and check my plugs. The plugs 
looked great, and i only took a few connections apart to put in the 
rubber/foam engine seal. This included the double relay, the big air box, and 
one coil wire. 
    I put it all back together just as it was and tried to start it. I got a 
cough and a bunch of smoke out of the exhaust. It would start with lots of 
effort, but sounded like its gonna die and go to hell and smoke like crazy 
out the rear.  O.k., time to check all air hoses and AFC flap. All good. No 
run. Check firing order. All staright. No Run. Check continuity between (new) 
coil and (new) wires to (new) cap and rotor. Its there. No run. After many 
unsuccessful tries, i took another look at the plugs. Soaked with gas. 
   When it does start, it sounds like the choke is closeing off all air from 
entering, and running with an extreme rich mixture. I dont get it because it 
was running great when i shut it off, and i really didnt do anything to the 
machanics of the engine. I only put the heater ducts together and the blower 
fan hoses on.
    If anybody has any advice regarding a similar experiance that they may 
have encountered, I would greatly appreciate any suggestions.
  I'm gonna get a few things on my system again, and check specifics Thursday 
during my next free hour. Till then, i'm a passenger in my girlfriends 
convertible Rabbit. Atleast i get to stll ride in an old VW.
