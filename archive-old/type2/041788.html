Subject: Good Karma and non aircooled people

Just wanted to pass along alittle story. Hope it's not a big deal since its 
not Friday.

Anyway, Thursday, my mom, brother and brother's girlfriend left Maryland for 
North Carolina to visit my sister for the weekend. I was going to go, but had 
WAY too much to do as I am moving. 
Anyway, my family are all real car nuts, and have been in the car business 
for as long as I can remember. My brother says he respects the old aircooled 
VW's but is really a watercooled guy. He works at a VW tuning shop, my mom 
does financing at a VW dealership. They both constantly hear stories of my 
two old VW's and tales from the list. They also hear about bus people always 
stopping to help other bus people. I must have told them a million times of 
how great the folks on this list are. 
Anyway, on the way to NC, they saw a broken down camper. They were like 
&quot;AWWW&quot; and said, &quot;we can't pass an aircooled bus!&quot;. So they stopped to help. 
I was SSSOOO
proud of them! The bus apparently was overheated, badly. They offered a lift, 
or a phone, as no one could offer mechanical advice. 
I was just so proud of them! Seems the good karma of this list has spilled 
over, and out of the aircooled community. 
You guy's rock!
