Subject: Spain calling

Hi list, 

I've been reading the list for a number of weeks now and have also asked
the occasional question (thanks for the help!!!!). It is a wonderful
resource and I'm glad I stumbled across it. However, it is really painful
to read all the ads for buses in the US. Being in Spain makes these
potential purchases sooooo much more expensive. It really hurts seeing
those prices. How I yearn for a &quot;parts&quot; bus. (I have found it hard to even
buy a timing light here, let alone timing lights with fancy gadgets). So,
my question is this: are there any Spanish/French/Italian/Moroccan listees
out there? I checked the archives and emailed a few people, but they
ignored me. Come on guys, the prices might be four times that in America,
but we gotta pull together.
Rant over
Thanks
Darren
