Subject: 70 westy engine reccomendations


I have a 70 westy with a dual port 1600 in it. Since I have had it I have 
had problems with leaking oil and overheating. I think alot of it has to do 
with the extensive driving I do and lead foot and it being a small engine 
for the weight of the bus. I want to be able to drive long distances with 
reliability and decent gas mileage. Has anyone replaced there engine in 
there westy with great success in these areas. I really dont think my engine 
is worth messing with because its got so many problems most recently being 
the heads and there stripped spark plug holes. Any advice would be greatly 
appreciated and where I can locate
the engine at a reasonable price.

Casey (Woody the 70 Westy)
