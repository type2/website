Subject: Re: [T2] Re: tightening rims/ wheels coming off

Hello List,

In my automotive class, my instructor will not let a
car leave the garage that has had the wheels removed
without the lug nuts being set to 80 ft/lbs torque.
This is especially true with aluminum wheels when
using an impact wrench. The lug nuts will actually
bind against the wheel before the wheel is seated in
place. I have seen this first hand. After using an
impact wrench to put the nuts back on an aluminum
wheel, I torqued it. I turned each nut several more
turns with the torque wrench before I reached 75-80
ft/lbs. I imagine that the same thing could happen to
a power coated wheel. I make a habit to torque each
nut once in a star pattern and then again going in a
circle pattern. It doesn't take hardly any time but it
is time well spent. 

Have a great day!

&gt; about a terrible vibration in the front end...I said
&gt; check the nuts, and
&gt; yes they were loose!  I've since learned to use a
&gt; longer wrench (a
&gt; sliding handle) and to tighten in the sequence that
&gt; follows one drawing
&gt; a star, or going clockwise, to the 2nd lug,  This is
&gt; done in 2 stages,
&gt; one just to get the nut seated in its recess, and
&gt; finally to really sock
&gt; it down.

&gt; &gt; well torque to spec, but one thing that does need
&gt; to be done is to make
&gt; &gt; sure the wheel is seated fully, I have seen many
&gt; that the wheel nut is not
&gt; &gt; fully down into the recess and it is hung up on a
&gt; slight imperfection in
&gt; &gt; the wheel, so after a while the imperfection lets
&gt; go and the lug nut gets
&gt; &gt; loose...
