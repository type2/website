Subject: Re: [T2] Type IV Thermostat Question

on 5/5/04 13:54, Ted Reshetiloff related:

&gt; Since these guys seem to be near impossible to find these days and folks are
&gt; using the type 1 thermostats with some mods I was wondering if anyone could
&gt; give their opinion on how well the conversion has gone.


list,

i was waiting to reply to this question with a tech article that has been in
the works for a while.

it is easy to put a type I t-stat in a type IV.

i wrote an article on how to do it:

h/tstat/t1_tstat_in_t4.tpl

we have the type 1 t-stats in stock.
