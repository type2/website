Subject: Epic Tales:  How my bus got home.

Howdy Volks.  Despite me being a bit cross and PO'd at the moment over 
the latest whacked out crazy topic-run-amok on the 'serv, I've decided 
I'll tell my story about how my 1966 Deluxe was relocated from Bellville, 
KS to Beatrice, NE.

Last October, I went with some friends of mine to Belleville, KS and we 
stopped and saw &quot;Edith&quot; - the gal with the farm who has a field of VW's.
As we were walking around her field, I walked by a 1966 VW bus.  I was in 
awe as this was my first time being this close to a bus.  I looked it 
over, mulled it over and $100 later it was mine.  Well, since winter was 
soon closing in on us, I was a bit reluctant to bring the bus home due to 
obviously weather problems and the big reason:  no place to store it.  

Well since that time, I located a guy who owns a farm and he rents a 
spot in his field for $5.00 a month per vehicle.  What a steal.  So it's 
taken this long to get schedules to jive, find someone to rent a trailer 
from, find a place to store the bus, and all that good stuff.

Yesterday it happened!

As expected, the plug for the trailer lights didn't match mine so I drove 
without lights.  Not a big deal in these parts but if a cop wants a 
reason to pull you over, he's got it.  Since I had to drive to a small town 
about 15 miles from here to pick the trailer up, I had to take the 
highway back into town.  Sure enough, I met a State Patrol on the way 
back and he gave me a good look as I drove by.  After a few blocks, I saw 
a police car whip around at an intersection and come up behind me.  (You 
Moral and Ethics committees can stop right there - don't even think of 
replying to this message!!!)  Great...just what I need.  So I downshifted 
my Suburban (w/automatic tranny) into 2nd and then 1st so that I could 
slow way down without activating any lights.  The squad car went on 
around me and all was clear the rest of the day.

I departed town with my younger brother, sister, and cousin at 9:30 and 
arrived via backroads (otherwise known as the &quot;scenic&quot; route) in 
Belleville, KS at about 12:30.  We mosied our way around town until we 
got to &quot;Edith's&quot; house and sure enough, there the bus still sat on the 
cement blocks (they didn't break).  With a push from my recruits, we 
rolled the bus off the blocks and after jimmying it around a while, got 
it lined up with the trailer.  We ended up unhitching the trailer from 
the Surburban and running a cable and chain to the bus.  Then I towed the 
bus up the ramps onto the trailer with my Suburban.  We anchored her down 
good with my tow chain and come along and a host of other straps.

Departure time:  3:00

We poked along the back roads and little 2 lane farm highways (which were 
filled with semi trucks due to the avoidance tactics required to pass 
the 2 weigh scales on the alternate route) and made it to the pasture at 
~5:00  We got lots of one-finger waves (the friendly kind), smiles, and 
stares.  Heck, in downtown Hubbell, NE there was a stock car parked on a 
trailer with some guys standing around it tying it down.  And this was on 
MAIN street!  Of course, this town is small but it does sport a bank, 
post office, general store, and grocery store.  It just goes to show the 
tolerant attitudes of the little midwest communities.

The biggest problem on the trip was the tendency for the rear end of my 
'burban to slither around.  I was all over the road on curves and had 
a hard enough time on the straight-aways.  It was the simple fact that I 
was carrying a lot of weight and I probably should have slid the bus more 
towards the rear of the trailer.  

So now, my bus sits only about 10 miles from me and when I get one of the 
bugs around here running, the bus will get worked on next.

Thanks for reading...
