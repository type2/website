Subject: Re: Type IV Cases - availability?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Anyone know about the price and availabilty of _new_ Type IV engine cases?

OK I'm going to ask it since no one else has, why the hell would
he want/need a NEW T4 case as the damn aluminum things are practicly
indestructable and damn near infinitely re-useable as VW cases go.
