Subject: Re: [T2] wireing my radio

Okay Amigo:
I think I understand that you are wanting to run your accessories from one
battery, while reserving the other for starting, but want to be able to
charge both with your alternator. The simplest way to do this is to install
a product called a &quot;Battery Isolator&quot; in between the batteries and the alt.
They are available from any 12v supply (marine, RV, home, ect.), and cost
about $50. Just insure that you are using proper size (and quality) wire. 12
gauge is not nearly sufficient to carry the kind of amperage that your alt
will put out into a low battery over any distance.  Try your library for a
book called &quot;The 12 Volt Doctor&quot; for more info on this, and on sizing your
wire, or p-mail me.
Cheers, and Happy Listening!
Matthew
