&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; A NEATO member (Collin) just called me up.  His '71 Bus is on the side of
&gt; the road with low oil pressure (light blinking) and strange sounds from
&gt; the engine.  He is currently in Big Oak Flat, near Modesto, CA.  Can
&gt; anyone recommend a mechanic in this area?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Peter
