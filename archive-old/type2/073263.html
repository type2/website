Subject: Re: [T2] Anti-Seize

&gt;The 'anti seize on spark plug threads' thread has been over for a while, but
&gt;I have a new (to me) wrinkle to add. I was at my bearing supplier today and
&gt;saw &quot;Nuclear Grade&quot; Anti Seize which claimed to be good for temps up to
&gt;2600F. Now I haven't installed my Flux Capacitor yet but when I do, I'm
&gt;wondering if this stuff will hold up to the temps generated by 1.21
&gt;gigawatts of electricity.
&gt;
&gt;Seriously, has anyone tried this type of anti seize on spark plugs? Does it
&gt;work or not?


I missed out on the earlier thread, and I've never heard of this super
stuff you're talking about, but here's my opinion on regular (Permatex, for
example) anti-seize compound.

I use it on everything:  spark plugs, body hardware, exhaust nuts, lug
bolts and nuts, etc, etc.  I just hate breaking off rusted bolts, and
anything which might prevent that is OK w/ me.  And when all threads are
lubed w/ anti-seize, I have a better chance of getting meaningful torque
readings.  I just put a brand new set of factory 16&quot; alloys on my T100
truck, and I sure wanted these megabuck wheels to be properly torqued.
