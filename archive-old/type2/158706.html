Subject: Re: [T2] AC

hello Arnaud Karl is right on this unless you plan on doing a lot of AC 
work, Sometimes the smart thing to do is to let the pros do it for you.

Sometimes yes, sometimes no. I didn't see the original question, but there are usually two things I won't mess with on a car-A/C and an automatic trans (other than fluid/filters). However, years ago I had a Vanagon that had dead A/C when I bought it. I saw those kits at Advanced Auto to convert R12 systems to R134a and figured &quot;What have I got to lose, except about $30.00?&quot;. The kit worked-the A/C started working again, and pretty good too. A year before I paid a garage to convert a Chevy Van from R12 to R134, and paid $450.00 for them to do it. After my experience with the Vanagon, I always wondered if the garage had simply used a kit like I had for $30.00! I posted my results on the Vanagon list, and after that kept getting emails from a guy insisting that it couldn't be that easy-that I had left out some crucial detail in getting my A/C on the Vanagon working again-I didn't. I simply bought the kit and followed the instructions.   YMMV,  Jeff
