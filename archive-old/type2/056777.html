Subject: Safety and Lock Rear Hatch!!!! 

Lock 'em up tight, (the kids that is) then they cant reach those latches,

&gt;...Russell also knows how to insert the ignition key, turn it to start,
release the parking brake, and take the bus in/out of gear.  Ask me how I
know... 

yup, my indicator lever no longer works and wobbles like mad, I swear there
is more play in the gear linkages, I found money in the tape deck (why
won't the &amp;*%$ cassette go in), flat batteries, open windows during rain,
all these joys make a bus the ideal family vehicle. :-)
