Here's a tough part to find, and I need one.

Do you happen to have the Wesfalia sink part for 80 t0 83 .. the little
plastic screw with the holes in it that allows the sink faucet arm to
move up an down.

It's just a shot in the dark.

I've been thinking about geting one for over a year. I guess I'll get
serious when the existing part finally breaks off completely.

Or just turn one out of brass stock when I have eight hours to spare.
