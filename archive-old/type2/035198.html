Subject: Subject: Source for 2L heads?

John Pearson asked:

 &gt;What is a good source for rebuilt 2L heads?

Do a search of the archives at type2_dot_com, running &quot;Mark Stephens&quot; and
&quot;AVP&quot; through the search engine.  There has been more discussion on
this topic than nearly any other.

 &gt;Are new 2L heads available?

No.

 &gt;Are the new Brazilian 1600dp motors any good?

I put one in my bug nine years ago, and in the 30,000 miles or so I've
put on it (no, I *don't* get out much), I've only had two problems with it.
Within the first year, one of the clips on the rocker shaft broke, allowing
an intake valve to be opened when it shouldn't have, it backfiring up through
the carburetor, blowing a hole through the paper air filter.  I pulled over,
made a temporary replacement with bailing wire, and was on my way.
A couple of years later, I was having fuel starvation problems, which I traced
to a heavily worn fuel pump rod which was made out of too soft of steel.
Actually, I'm not certain that came with the engine.  In any case, I'd heartily
recommend new Brazilian 1600dp engines for those not in a position to
build their own (which I did for the bus, and even more heartily recommend
than buying a new engine, that's probably not balanced all that well, nor
having the correct CR for the gas you will be using).
