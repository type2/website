&lt;but tools you get to keep and continue to use and learn with 
 there are those of us who get every tool you can imagine&gt;

And with tools you can employ yourself for cash or favors! 

I bought a nice table saw after struggling with a tiny one that belonged to my grandfather (50 year old Craftsman saw). My bigger saw (newer is inconsequential with GOOD tools alot of times) has helped me make furniture, sandboxes, VW parts, work tables, etc. My welder has helped me fix my bus, build trailers, fix the lawnmower, bicycle, etc.
