Subject: Solar Power For Your Van!

        I erased the message that gave the advice about the solar
panels for the laptop from REALGOODS before I thought about 
replying to the message.
        I've been getting their catalogs for about 6 months 
because I was interested in learning if I could power my log cabin with
solar. (I found out it is way too expensive and complicated) but I 
received information from them at the same time about powering RV's
with a top loaded solar panel.  I'm not sure if it is removable or not
(you wouldn't want to drive around with the thing tilted on top) but 
the cost was under $1,000 for a set up that would run practically anything
you could ever hope to put in your VW Camper.  

Something to consider if you like to camp in way-out places.
