Subject: Japanese buses

I just got back form 2 VW shows in Japan.   WOW!!!!   What a nice country
and what nice VWs!!!
They take care of them, they don't leave here only to get abused there.
Average nice vw is worth $20,000 in Japan.
No primer cars there.
Anybody want to plan a trip there in May?  Big show in Nagoya called Bug
Panic

See you there.
