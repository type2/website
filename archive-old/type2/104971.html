&gt;second question: (and a two part one at that)
&gt;where do you suggest i get keys cut? my bus has one
&gt;key and i am having a hard time finding someone with a
&gt;blank to cut me a new one.....also, is the ignition
&gt;key the same as the door key? or where there 2 back
&gt;then....?

Give Steve Sandlin a call.  He has the R blanks and if you want he can cut you new keys by code.

You can also try the other well known VW locksmith, Garbiel Garcia &lt;vwschlussel_at_cs_dot_com&gt; 209-462-2851.
