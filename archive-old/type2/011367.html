Subject: RE: Westfalia Tent Questions 
Date: Wed, 2 Aug 2000 08:57:12 US/Mountain

&gt;I am still contemplating purchasing a side tent for my Westfalia. 
&gt;For those of you that have these nice options on your Westfalias, are they 
&gt;worth it? Are they something that you would use a lot? Or are they more 
&gt;trouble than they are worth? 

Well, since you're asking for personal opinions...

Pros: Cool original camping accessory.  Many of those without one secretly or 
openly envy those with one.  Great quality/very sturdy (withstood the side 
effects of a hurricane one weekend).  When hooked to the bus, you don't have to 
slide that noissssy door open at 3AM to get out so you can take a wizz.  When 
hooked to the bus, it makes dressing/undressing a LOT easier (especially with 
more than 1 person).  In my opinion, much more asthetically pleasing than all 
the ugly nylon tents out there.

Cons: They've become too well recognized and are worth too much - I'm afraid to 
drive away and leave it unattended at a campsite.  It IS nearly 30 years old 
and if it gets damaged (or pieces lost) it's not easily replaced.  When 
attached to the bus, I find it becomes just a hallway into the bus and it 
limits airflow through the bus.  Takes a LOT longer to set up and take down 
than a new nylon tent.  As compared to new tents, its one heavy muther!

After using it quite a bit from 1991 - 94 I finally went and bought a generic 2-
room nylon tent for $100 or so.  Now I take that one with me to campouts.  When 
camping with no facilities, 1 side gets the port-a-potty and the other side is 
the storeroom.  When I drive away and leave it standing, I don't worry if it 
will be there when I get back.  Doesn't look nearly as cool though.
