&gt; are there any issues i should be aware of trying to
&gt; replace the fire-damaged FI from my 1975 1800cc motor
&gt; with components from a 1978?
&gt; i know the parts numbers are different, but does
&gt; anyone know what the practical differences are?

The ECU is different, the AFM is different, the air plenum is 
different, the throttle body is different, the EGR is different, and of 
course the harness is different.

On the 75, the EGR is electro-vacuum, and the EGR pipe runs to the 
throttle body, vacuum opens up the valve, and when that happens the ECU 
is informed electrically.  On the 78, the EGR is mechanical and the EGR 
pipe runs to the air plenum, the valve is connected to the throttle 
linkage with a rod; I'm not sure exactly how the ECU is notified with 
the later version.

The 75 and 78 throttle bodies use different &quot;wide open&quot; switches.  
Actually, does the 78 even have a &quot;wide open&quot; switch?

The 75 AFM does not have an intake air temperature sensor, but the 78 
does.  75 relies on pre-heated intake air.  75 AFM has a 6-pin 
connector, 78 has a 7-pin connector.

The intake runners are compatible, the injectors are compatible, the 
aux air valve is compatible, the thermo-time switch is compatible, the 
cold start valve is compatible, the fuel pump and pressure regulator 
compatible, the decel valve compatible, double-relay compatible, series 
resistors compatible.

Did I miss anything?

I think if you use all of the &quot;otherwise incompatible&quot; 1978 FI 
components together, you should be fine.  The 75 FI (1.8L) is basically 
identical to the early 76 FI (2.0L), so there should be no problems 
caused by the difference in displacement (that's one of the nice things 
about the L-Jetronic).

Richard Atwell has a great FI parts cross-reference:

I'm sorry that you have to work on repairing fire damage :-(
