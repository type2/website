Subject: Exploding Oil Filters

If I may toss my two cents into the pot on this....

I have had a few filters explode on me, never noted the brand, as the
common thread always seemed to be the time of year and weight of oil
rather than the brand of filter.  The usual time for filters to burst is
on a cold morning right after you start the car with the block full of
your summer heavy weight oil.  Those of you living LA-ward probably don't
have this problem, but it has always given me extra incentive to do that
oil change in the fall.
