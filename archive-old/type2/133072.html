Subject: Re: [T2] rear negative camber

Rob,

I had problem like this on a super beetle...ended up replacing the 
bushings with urethane ones and most of the problem went away.



Not sure that is your problem, you are just going to have to look!

Cheers, dave

&gt; When I got my NC inspection the guy jacked up the bus and wiggled all the

&gt; imagine that is still a lot of work. Assuming my bushings are good, is it
