Subject: RE: [VB] Rev Limiting Rotors

RPM limiter plates became popular in the Super Vee 1200 world and made it to
the 1300-1600 engines for street drag back in the late sixties early
seventies. Don't see them much anymore because of the better balanced parts
available to rev ya up to 6500 safely for short periods of time.For me,
anything above 4400 is a no no on my 67 SC with the 1641 DP stock engine and
my RGB/tranny setup.

dont these only start to work at like 5500 rpm's or something?  you would
have to be deaf not to know that you should let your foot off the pedal at
that point, that is if your poor engine doesnt go first.  as far as i know
they are for porsches and drag racers.  let me know if you find them with a
lower cut off, say 3400 or something.  id be interested in those.

&gt; &gt; I know a while back some one was selling these special rotors...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Are they still available?  If so, who sells them?
&gt; &gt;

&gt; Looks like you can get them with the resistor removed in case you are
&gt; runnning some sort of CDI too.
