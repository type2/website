Subject: 78 stumbles going forward

Well, I got the bus running after fixing the vacuum
leak and it ran well for a couple of days.

I went and filled the gas tank completely and now
there is a severe stumbling. I'm guessing it is
correlate I am able to rev it
to (estimating 3-4K) in neutral and it runs fine.

I am able to reverse and it seems OK. Going forward
it will run ok for a second, almost die, run again, 
etc.

I mentioned this in a previous post.. When I did my 
fuel lines, I found a metal spring (like you would
find in a pen only bigger) in the metal fuel line
which
drops out of the body on the passenger side (i.e. the
tank outlet). My theory is that the tank is filled
with
crud and that spring was pushing up a little into the 
tank and allowing fuel to flow through. I figure when
I filled the tank I dislodged some of the crap.

I know the proper technique would be to measure
fuel pressure while driving.. (not sure where to get
a guage that would fit) or to pull the tank and clean 
it. Since I just pulled my engine I'm thinking I'm
looking for unorthodox suggestions (maybe put another
spring in there like the PO did).. or maybe its not
the
tank and I am missing it and it is something else.

Any suggestions appreciated!

Thanks,
