Subject: 82 Vanagon Heat Exchanger/Exhaust hangers?

Hi All:

I am getting ready to mount the heat exchangers and exhaust to my new
engine for my 82 Vanagon. I am sure that there must be something else
that holds up the rear portion or the heat exchangers and supports some
of the weight of the exhaust. I have looked at the parts disassembly
diagrams on my ETKA, Bentley's and Haynes, but do not see anything like
this. I know that the older buses had something, any idea what the
Vanagons used?

Regards,
