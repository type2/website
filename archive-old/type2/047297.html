Subject: Re: [T2] Kick Panels

[...]

Except for the hole for the windshield washer filler.....they are a mirror
image.

&gt; The front kick panels in my '74 Westy are ripped and seem to be disolving.
&gt; I would like to replace them with a wooden kick panel.  However, I only
have
&gt; the passenger's side kick panel and 1/2 of the driver's side.  Does anyone
&gt; have an old kick panel like something left over from replacing theirs or
&gt; maybe a template I could use to cut one laying around?  I'd appreciate the
&gt; help.
