Subject: Re: [T2] m9 to m8 exhaust studs.

Jack,

The local &quot;Ace hardware&quot; store.  They have a big section of metric nuts 
and bolts and stainless as well.

Cheers, dave

 VW has obsoleted the m9 to m8 exhaust studs for bus heads. Does anyone
 have three squirreled away with which he or she might be willing to
 part? The best I've been able to find locally are hardened m9 studs, but
&gt; they are not a stock item and I will have to buy the minimum -- either
&gt; 100 or 500.
