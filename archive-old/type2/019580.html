References: &lt;39B58BD9.3338B198_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

I believe it's called a check valve, and it keeps a vacuum in the line
when the engine shuts off to give you a little assistance for a few more
brake pumps... i.e. when you stall, you can still stop :)

&gt; What exactly is that plastic bit called that goes in the vacuum line for
&gt; the booster (servo) back near the engine tin? Y'know, the one with the
&gt; little arrow that points at the motor. What does it do? IIRC, Bentley
&gt; tells how to test it, but my Bentley's in the bus at the shop.
