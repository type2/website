Subject: oil light came on!!

So, victory may be short lived.  Please read and offer any suggestions or 
experience. I'll start checking the oil sensor, pressure relief valve and 
thermostat bellows per Muir.

After driving the bus around yesterday afternoon, I decided to take it to 
work today.  Soon as I started up and backed out, the oil light flickered 
on. Stopped, checked the oil - it was just below the lower line on the 
dipstick, so I added about 3/4 qt and went on my way. I noticed the light 
flickering on during turns and starting from a stop. It'd flicker 2 or 3 
times and go off. No leaks under the bus while I was at work. Tonight, onthe 
way home, the light came on a bit more frequently. I stopped, checked the 
oil, checked the bottom - no obvious leaks, no nasty burning smell. On the 
way I thought I may have heard some noises, but idling in the driveway I 
didn't hear or smell anything unusual. The only thing I noticed is that I 
may have slightly overfilled the oil.

Work is only 13 miles away, so maybe the problem is just starting to 
manifest.
The odom says 155,000 and I don't know if it's been rebuilt. It was 
converted from carb back to the stock f.i. several years ago, but that's all 
I know.

Thanks
Mat
'78 bus
