Subject: [T2] Petronix and spark plugs

I'm about to install a Petronix and a CD ignition system on my 1776.  The
instructions say that spark plugs can be opened up quite a bit from the
stock value.

What is the theory behind this?
Is it necessary to do so to run with the Petronix and CD? Or can I leave
the gaps as they are?

Thanks, Jack
