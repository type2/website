Subject: cleaning up old windshields

The '72 has a spiffy new windsheild but the '67 is hurting. The glass has so
many scratches and wear marks from windshield wipers that it hard to see
thru, especially at night when the oncoming headlights seem to flare on the
scratches. I really dont wanna replace the original glass. Are they are
products and or methods that will clean, polish or restore the glass?
