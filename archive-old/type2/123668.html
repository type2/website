&gt;&gt; What is the latest thinking on the best exhaust nut composition?
&gt;&gt; Brass? Stainless Steel? Zink? Or anti-seize?

&gt; Stainless steel if you can get it is great. Silicon bronze is also
&gt; excellent. If you are in the United States and can obtain either of
&gt; these in metric thread (check boating stores) then use them. NEVER
&gt; use brass or zink! Both would corrode in minutes.

When I recently replaced my exhaust earlier this year I used zinc
metric from Home Depot as I couldn't find anything else.

I ran the van until the coating burned off the pipes and repainted
with high heat paint to help keep the corrosion down.

I have no clue as to a temperature rating on the bolts I used but
haven't seen any problems so far.

Should I replace them????  ....before things get too far???
