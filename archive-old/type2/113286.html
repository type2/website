Subject: RE: [T2] Cookin' the hub - it's done, anyone want a bite?

&gt; Note that I did state my assumptions correctly :0)  I'll try cooling it in a
&gt; cooler of ice before hammering next time just to see.

Maybe just set a cold-one out of the fridge on the race for a few minutes
before pounding. Then drink it when you're done!
