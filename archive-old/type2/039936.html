Subject: Re: Name Tags

Our BMW motorcycle club has used tags like those George describes with
much success, and for the same reasons put forth by Jamie &amp; Chris. They're
distinctive, durable, and a really big help for folks (like me!) who
can't remember names!  So, George's Dad gets my vote as imminent supplier
of List Name Tags...
