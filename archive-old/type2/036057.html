&gt;So why are y'all carrying them around by hand? Bone-headed machismo?

on the weekends, the barracks are pretty much dead, so i couldnt find any 
buddies to help. neither thought of nor had a hand cart...im sure there was 
one floating around the barracks but i had no idea where.soooo- i put the 
clutch on my abs, grabbed the middle set of studs on either side, and lifted 
with my legs (hence the leg injury- always lift with legs! better injured 
legs than injured backs!!)
i didnt even really notice anything till a couple days later. right now id 
sell my soul for a heated garage to work in instead of a parking lot...no 
wait, ill sell someone elses soul...someone i dont like :)
