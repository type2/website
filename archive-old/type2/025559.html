The Jester, 69 sends:

&gt; I believe a lot of stations mix regular and super to get mid-grade fuel.

If you have a Sunoco station with the magical seven-grade pump in your area,
check out the fuel storage tanks. They have two--one for regular and one for
high-test--and ration it out in precise mixtures to give you the seven
different octane ratings.

And let's face it, 89 octane isn't much different from 87--just a little dab
of 93 added to a big dose of 87 would do ya.

I know North Carolina takes samples of the gas being sold at each station to
be sure you're getting what's marked on the pump--a hydrometer will tell you
what's what if you know how to read it for that.
