Subject: Re: [T2] Brazilian VW Bus

A nieghbor of mine bought a sweet Mexican beetle off of an immigrant.  They are allowed to bring one Mexican vehicle in with them and are exempt from the regulations.  They can then turn around and sell that vehicle.  I suppose if you found an immigrant that you could trust, you could send them the money and have them buy the bus.  Then flip it to you when it gets here.  Maybe for a profit.   Only way I know of.  Cheers...KR
