&gt; The reason for my visit to this list is to gather information on a 1972
&gt; westy that I might be able to acquire. I haven't talked to the owners yet,
&gt; but someone who was looking at it said the only thing wrong with it was the
&gt; engine. I know I have heard of a bastard engine around this time, which year
&gt; was it and what was the problem?

Not a 'bastard' engine.  First year of the type4 'pancake' engine.  No access
hole over the engine.  Makes maintenance a bit more of chore.  1700 motor is a
reasonably reliable piece.

&gt;
&gt; The bus is in good shape just looking at it on the surface. It is a hard top
&gt; westy with a walk thru seat. It still even has the child cot, and all of the
&gt; interior parts.

Sounds like a score!

&gt;
&gt; The guy that was looking at it said the owners wanted $500.00 for it. Is
&gt; this a fair price for that year bus with a bad motor? Also could someone
&gt; give me an idea on the price of a complete brake job, thetas parts only
&gt; because I can do the job myself. Also what does a Tranny go for for that
&gt; year in case this one is bad?

You can spend a couple of grand on a motor doing it right.  Brakes?  Goto
http://www.busdepot_dot_com and price 'em yourself.  Tranny?  Boneyard, a couple of
hundred.  Rebuilt, around $500.

&gt;
&gt; I know I will need cosmetics on the outside, but the inside is in great
&gt; shape!
&gt; Any other advice on things to look out for or be aware of? Thanks for any
&gt; advice someone could give, because it might be time for my first non split
&gt; bus.

Having owned a '62, a '77 and an '84, I find that I prefer the loaf.  Has the
most 'character'.  I'd rather drive the '77 than the Vanagon even though the
Vanagon is more 'civilized'. However, having Vanagon seats in the '77 has
probably colored my opinions a bit.  Not an easy install, but worth every
minute of the time it took to do it!
