Subject: Free Seat

I have a middle bench seat out of an early bay that I need to get rid of. I
don't know if these are hard to come by or not but this one is free. It's
black and in fair shape, a few holes in the upholstery and the arm rest is a
bit beat up. If there are no takers it's going to the dump.

I'm in north Phoenix.
