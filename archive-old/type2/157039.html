Subject: Another Hitch Q - Front or Back?

Thanks for the hitch help! Jamie's certainly seems the way to go, and he
confirmed he is still making them.
Someone made a great suggestion of a front hitch, given possible rear
clearance issues. We're a family of four, so our Thule carrier sticks out
quite a bit. Can anyone think of any issues (legal, safety, ?) issues for
using a front carrier with 4 bikes?
I like the front idea over the rear for a few reasons - easier engine and rear
hatch access, clearance, but am I bit worried of getting pulled over. Don't
know why, maybe because I've just never seen a front bike carrier...
Thanks for the help and advice!
Tony
