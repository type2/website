Subject: Type IV fan hole
Date: Wed, 14 Mar 2001 19:47:10 -0600
	charset=&quot;Windows-1252&quot;

Any of you type-4-engine Bus folks know what the threaded hole in the top of
the fan housing is??? It's about 1 1/2 inches (I think).  It was pouring out
air until I taped it temporarily 'cause I figured this couldn't be correct.
It was practically feeding warm air into my weirdo oil-bath filter which is
suspended over the intake manifold (Porsche-style I believe), which in my
sub-tropical climate is totally unnecessary.

My Westy also has a mysterious rain leak that I thought was the back hatch
but I can seem to prove it.  It also ends up with water at the bottom of the
hanging clothes closet and has rotted out a rust hold in front of the
hanging clothes door.

Any Ideas?

Thanks,
Wade
