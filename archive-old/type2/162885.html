Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch Pedal Travel Question

Billy &amp; then Mike:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Never understood the &quot;double clutch&quot; concept.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;With double clutching, you help it along.  You press the clutch to 
&gt;take it out of gear (which isn't really needed unless you're really 
&gt;loading them), then you release the clutch and rev the engine, then 
&gt;you press the clutch again and downshift.  This helps synchronize 
&gt;the gears, or at least get them closer.

	Name is properly 'double declutching'  -  I'd not heard this 
degenerate version (the sort of fate that awaits those who unwisely 
depart from the Empire).
	It's done for gear changes in either direction, up or down. 
Either way, the point is to engage the clutch  -  let the pedal UP  - 
in neutral, with the revs right for the gear you're changing INTO.
	It's especially relevant to motors with that quaint component 
long since abandoned by Jap motorcycle designers -  the FLYWHEEL.
	For instance, if you're changing from 1st into 2nd, you begin 
by getting totally off the accelerator.  You then change into 
neutral, including letting the clutch pedal right up.  When the revs 
have dropped to the right speed for the gear you're going into, stomp 
down the clutch pedal again and slip 'er into 2nd.
	This was all required before synchromesh was invented.  Such 
classics as the mighty Fiat 500 (assembled in NZ) had no synchromesh 
well into the 1960s  -  it really is a decadent luxury spurned by 
hard-core petrolheads who continue to double-declutch if only for 
nostalgia.
