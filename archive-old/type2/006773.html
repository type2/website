&gt;What is meant by a &quot;leak down test&quot; ?
&gt;
     &lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt;I am going to do a compression check (dry &amp; wet) ASAP, is this what is
&gt;meant by a &quot;leak down test&quot; ?
&gt;

     Close. They both detect the same problems, the leak down with
greater accuracy. A guage and air hose are plugged into your spark plug
hole, with the cylinder at tdc, and the air is turned on. Once it hits
pressure, the guage will give a percentage of air leaked away, and you
can tell by listening for the escaping air where your leak is. If it
comes from the intake, it's the intake valve, from the exaust it's the
exaust valve, from the oil breather it's the rings. Pretty nifty little
device for checking your engines health, but plenty more expensive than
the compression tester and you need an air compressor for it. It's one of
the tools I'll be getting whenever I get a compressor (yeah, dream on...).

Peace,
