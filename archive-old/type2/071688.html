Subject: T4 oil filler tube needed
X-Diagnostic: Not on the accept list
X-Envelope-To: type2

Volks,
	my oil filler tube is leaking. When I got the bus, the tube 
had been brazed at the curve, and now it's leaking. I don't know the 
history of the bus, and I don't know how or why the tube broke in the 
frist place. All I know is that it's leaking again and I need a new 
one. I haven't fount it anywhere for sale, so I'm hoping that one of 
you volks will have a T4 engine sitting in your basement or back yard 
that you can, out of the goodness of your heart, pull the tube off of 
and send it to me. I'll pay for shipping and any reasonable price you 
want for the tube. Thanks,
Joel
