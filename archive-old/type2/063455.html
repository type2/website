Subject: Re: What's the biggest box you've fit in your split?

About a month ago I fit an 18 cubic foot refrigerator in &quot;the fire truck&quot;.
We put in in the side doors. I had to remove the seats, though. Fit great,
except we scratched the paint on the metal wall behind the passenger seat.
&quot;Don't worry&quot;, I said, &quot;it's covered under warranty&quot;.
