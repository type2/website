Subject: Re fridges- I removed the ammonia one in 78
References: &lt;200104272333.QAA34844_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

I now use either an ice cooler (the rolling narrow one) or a Coleman
thermoelectric which appears to be about 2 cubic feet, less than $100 at
a KMart.  The Coleman insulates very well, they now have (Walmart) a
nonelectric version that touts 5 days of keeping kool with ice.  Removed
the stock ammonia fridge, whose capacity was not worth the heat output
when trying to sleep next to it on summer trips!  We were using ice in
the stock one just to avoid this heat.  Decided we'd rather have the
room to seat another person and go for a portable fridge.  I put in the
triple bedseat from a 74 bus and modified the rear closet (side door
opening cut into it, slot cut acrose the front so the bed seat could
open), see this link:

   Advantage of the portable one is that it can go outside the bus at
night and the Coleman makes a nice seat. It stores behind the passenger
seat; I installed a board with webbing loops there so bungees would keep
the fridge (and potty) in place.  The electric one is good &quot;to keep the
ice longer&quot; if you camp with hookups and drive a lot per day- we still
keep block ice in it or freeze 1/2 gall. milk bottles of water.  Put
cold sodas in, it keeps cold better than getting things cold.  Any
Holiday Inn or other major chain has ice machines you can access!  If
going to the boonies, I'd look into a propane fridge that vents
externally.
