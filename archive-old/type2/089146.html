Howdy Folks-

Who do we like for doing reliable repair/mild performance headwork on
Type 4 heads? 

I have a 1982 Westfalia that in retrospect, I wish I would have stroked,
rather than bored. But nonetheless, it is a 2056 cc with 96mm P/Cs, a
counterweighted crank, a race balance, Pertronix ignition, and basically
stock everything else (except oil coolers/oil pump). 

I have a pair of 2.o 1982 heads that I would like to have cleaned-up and
cc'd to give a little smoother/better performance to this very mild
motor. I'm not looking for race stuff, I have to keep stock fuel
injection for emissions, but can get away with some stuff. Reliability,
mileage, and smoothness (sound) are all considerations. Performance
increase desired, but not at the absolute exchange of those
considerations.

Thoughts on Who, and What to do appreciated.
