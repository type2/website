Of the three buses we have had in North Carolina (1967,1969 and 1972) all
have been titled as station wagons. I had the original title on the 1969 and
it was titled that way when the State of NC origally titled it in july of
1969(built in May) I always figured that the dealerships did this in
conjuction woth VWoA as a means of getting around import taxes on commercial
vehicles.
