&gt; I bought two new 13mm wrenches (12 point and a 6 point count on the boxes)
&gt; just recently from Lowes.
&gt; 
&gt; They are the brand that they sell with their lifetime warranty.
&gt; I think their brand name is &quot;Kobalt&quot;, or some such.

I have some of these.  Kobalt is owned Snap-on and are only available at
Lowe's.  I find these wrenches inexpensive, well made and very comfortable.
Easy to read, nice finish.  My buddy has a lot of Snap-on tools and he
recommended them to me.
