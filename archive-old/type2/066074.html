Subject: CV clunk

Folks,

I hope someone out there in list land can help me. 

I repacked my CVs recently when I replaced the rubber boots. I then did a 
600 mile return trip without any trouble. When I next drove my bus, I 
noticed a clunking noise when I went around a right hand turn. 

We have lots of roundabouts in this town, and because we drive on the 
left of the road, right turns around roundabouts put a lot of weight on 
the left of the vehicle, particularly if you power out of the turn. 
Under these circumstances, I was getting a clunk, usually only one or 
two until the body straightened up.

I thought it was coming from the outer CV so I swapped the drive shaft 
around. The clunk then seemd to reverberate more through the body. I 
deduced from this that the outer CV was the noisy one.

I bought a new CV ($A120) and fitted it to the outer end after wswapping 
the shaft around again. The clunk was worse and I was getting a 
scrapeing (sp?) sound under deceleration, but not all the time, only 
after I powered up to traffic speed (35-40mph).

Last night, I swapped the old CVs. Put back the one I took out 
originally and left it as the inner CV (did it in 45 mins - no grease 
repacking though - I getting good at this). Still get a clunk around corners.

I've ordered another new CV. It arrives tomorrow so I can't do it until 
Friday night. I will then have new CVs at each end t=of the left hand 
drive shaft.

When I originally repacked the old CVs the balls were very shiny, but the 
races had wear marks. No sign of hardfacing deteriorating. I cleaned 
them up with petrol and dried them with a towel. They were left overnight 
before I repacked them. I DIDN&quot;T note which way the drive shaft came out 
so I don't know whether I put them back the way they were, ie inner to 
inner and outer to outer.

I used Muir and Bentley  for guidance.

My question is, if the second new CV doesn't stop the clunk, what could 
the problem be?

I have checked my wheel studs and the main wheel bearing. There is no 
looseness there. Could it be the right hand CVs? 

The sound certainly seems to come from the LHS but there's nothing 
definite about sounds reverberating through a vehicle.

Any advice will be appreciated.

Thanks
