Can anyone recommend a good, bus-friendly, paint and body shop in Southern
California, preferably the Inland Empire?  Time to get some bodywork done on
the '71.

Also, I am selling my 1972 Adventure Camper.  I will be putting a website
together with all the particulars, but the bus can be seen at
www.homestead_dot_com/mvandam/vwcamper.html
for now. I will post again once I have the for sale site up, until then
email me with any questions.
It is located in Upland, CA about 40 miles east of Los Angeles.
I don't have the time, energy, money or motivation to deal with 2 buses,
particularly when one has a Type 1 motor, the other a Type 4.  I would
rather concentrate on restoring the 71.

And now for a little story...a couple of weeks back, I was having a garage
sale at my house when some guy pulls up in a beautiful old split window bus.
I don't know much about the split windows, but this was a nice one.  I
struck up a conversation with the guy, and got all the details about his
bus, and almost passed out.  Turns out it is a 1959 Camper (not sure if it
was a Westy or not, owner didn't know either, he didn't know anything about
buses) that he had just purchased a week ago.  His neighbor was the original
owner, who had spent most of his retirement restoring the bus.  A couple of
months after he finished it, he passed away.  The wife, who hated the bus,
then sold it to this guy for $3500.  This bus was beautiful, looks like it
just rolled off the assembly line.  No rust, perfectly straight, new paint,
new interior, and get this, the original motor with 45,000 original miles.
The guy then goes on about how much he doesn't like the bus, it is too slow,
drives like crap, etc.  Needless to say, I offered to buy it right then and
there.  He said no, so I gave him my name and number and asked him to call
me if he changes his mind.  I am keeping my fingers crossed.  Hopefully he
doesn't take it to Pomona, or it will be on its way to Japan.

Thanks,
