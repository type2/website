I run a 1776 and really wish I had gone for a stroker crank as well.

hello Trey  yes I have ran both engines.  I wouldn't stop at  1641cc go
ahead and do a 1776. I personally prefer single ports as the torque
is  better. don't skimp on heads as they and a good torque cam can make
all  the difference in the world.  Remember also that the bigger the motor
the  hotter it will run later  mark dearing
