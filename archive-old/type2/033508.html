&gt; Can tranny fluid leak into the CV boot? Or is it possible that the CV

In the flange that the CV joint bolts to there is a cup that keeps oil
from coming out into the CV.  This cup can pop out on its own, but usually
pos out when the tranny has too much oil in it.

When mine poped out i took off the inner CV from the tranny, and just
popped the cup back in with a hammer and a socket.  Dont pound too hard or
you'll break/bend it.  you can tell when its fully seated usually...

and check the level of your tranny fluid to make sure its not too high.

peas,

Steve
