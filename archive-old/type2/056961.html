Subject: thermostat missing/other alternatives?

Greetings...

I have recently installed an oil temp gauge in my 71 camper.  Upon driving
it, I have noticed the oil temp reaching 250 deg. while driving on the
highway...  

Yikes!!!

As far as I know, there are no calibrations necessary for an oil temp
gauge, so I presume my oil temp is really that high..  First check is the
thermostat, to see if I'm getting air flowing over my cylinders...

Pull of the right, underside tin to reveal... (drumroll please)...

No Thermostat!!!

Yep, whoever rebuilt the engine before I purchased it forgot this little
nicety.  There is nothing on the stud where the thermostat should be
mounted, and as far as I could tell, no way for the fan flaps to open
(obviously).  

Now I am not able to see the air control flaps when I take off the curved
tin (which makes me wonder if I've got the correct tin), but I was
wondering if it made more sense to install a thermostat, or to fix the air
flaps in the permanently open position?  

I wasn't able to get a good view of the flaps and the manuals (haynes,
bentley, or muir) don't really have a good diagram of the way this cooling
system operates, so I'm not entirely sure what's involved with installing
a thermostat.

The main question, is:  under normal circumstances, do I need to remove
the engine to install a thermostat?

As far as I can tell, the engine hasn't suffered any adverse effects from
this overheating, but it is naive of me to think that I can get away from
this problem for much longer...

Any advice is appreciated...

Thanks...
