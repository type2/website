Subject: Re: [T2] ramva illistrations?

Hi Dave,

Once upon a time I archived that site into a PDF file for future 
reference.

Unfortunately I don't have room on my site to store it permanently, but 
I DO have the bandwidth available to make the 3.2 MB file available for 
those who want to snag a copy in the meanwhile. Get it while the 
gettings good, it won't be there forever.

Adobe Acrobat might not be as universal a format as html, but the 
program does come in handy from time to time, particularly when I need 
it to archive pages for later use offline. Happy trails,

&gt; Sure was a help to be able to point to it when describing parts.
