Subject: Re: [T2] The VW Transporter, remedy for a healthy future?

&gt; &gt; It got me thinking... If more people drove
&gt; Volkswagen transporters, they
&gt; &gt; probably wouldn't be as stressed out. 

My bus has in the past couple days of me finally being
able to drive has made me understand just how fun
driving used to be..

I make up excuses to go somewhere, i just want to
drive the slow-speed transporter. You cant travel at a
moderate 55-60 mph here in california anymore,
regardless of the time people are always in a hurry..
To tell you the truth it is sad, my bus is making me
relax and take it easy..

Just yesterday im driving my wifes town &amp; country van
and im only doing 55-60, and shes like what is wrong
w/ you lets pick up the pace, i say, for what were in
no hurry, but shes worried about all the people
passing and going around us.. I just smile......

peace,
rob
