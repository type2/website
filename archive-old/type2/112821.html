Subject: 75 Engine Cross Member

I purchased a rear cross member for my 75 bus.  I need the cross member
that goes under the engine and the engine mounts bolt into it.  The
cross member I received from motorworks doesn't look right but may be
correct since I don't know what the mount should look like.  Could
someone take a picture of theirs either in or out of their bus??  It
would help me a great deal.  The part number for the cross member I
received is 211 703 475G.  Does anyone know the part number (or can look
it up) for the engine cross member is this the correct part number???
Any help would be wonderful.  I bought this bus with the engine in
pieces and am finishing the previous owners project so I didn't realize
I was missing this part.  Thanks Again.  Mark Fischer.
