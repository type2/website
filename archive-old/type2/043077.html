Subject: Re: racing steering wheel

greetings from brisbane australia.  from my own experience i know that there 
is a sports steering wheel kit available for the kombi from saas, just 
choose your steering wheel and the boss kit, although i would check the 
local regulations in your state, some states only allow the wheel to be a 
certain number of inches smaller than the original.  i have gotten use to 
the normal vw steering wheel since i bought my kombi, to the point where i 
would be inclined to keep it.  adding a few more psi to the front tyres is 
sometimes an easier way to lighten the steering, although we must once again 
be aware of the manufacturers specifications

regarding reversing, you could try one of those fish eye lens thingys for 
the back window, available at most auto shops and they just stick on.  i 
don't have one however, i just keep going till i hear the sound of twisted 
metal

&gt;Anyone replaced the huge steering whell with something smaller
&gt;and more car like? Do you have to do too many turns on a smaller
&gt;wheel. Just a case of changing wheels over or do you have to
&gt;adjust other things as well?
&gt;
&gt;Better to drive?
&gt;
&gt;Any hints for reversing a Kombi, only driven once and finally got my
&gt;own bus. I have been told reversing is hard at first
