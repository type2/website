Hey there,
Usually this is vintagebus material...but there seems to be some
misunderstanding here between the old and &quot;new&quot; buses...

1949/50-1952? -- 25hp
1953-1958 -- 36hp
1959-1963 -- 40hp with optional 1500 engine in '63
1964-1967 had 1500 engines I believe
1968-1971 -- 1600 engine - 71 had a 1600 dual port.  all engines before this
were single port.
then in 72, all he!! broke loose....

I take it you've never driven around an old bus?  If it has the 36hp engine...it
is SLOW.  Although 36hp was not stock for 59 buses. I just put a 40 horse engine
in my 62 and its SLOW...won't top 57mph on straight aways....50 up little
hills... 60 down them. SLOW.  These early buses have transmissions that are
geared really low.  I run the stock/original &quot;small nut&quot; tranny in my 62 (59-63)
and before with my 1500 engine...it would push the bus 75mph if I wanted to go
that fast.  Its like driving a whole different bus.  If you're used to driving
late model buses (72 and on) you're in for a BIG suprise when you hop into this
59.  Don't get me wrong...these things are a hoot to drive... just warning you
;-)

Sounds like a good deal really...

Keep in mind that even if you build a bigger engine....you could go faster...
BUT... you're still turning the same RPMs.  55mph is around 4000 RPMs in my 62.
in my 71... 75mph is around 4000 RPMs I believe....

Just a little informative bit....

&gt; I found a 59 kombi to purchase for 1000.00 bucks.  it runs and is totally
&gt; stock original.  It was found in the Washington State Desert and has been
&gt; parked since 69.  the owner that is selling it to us bought it about 4 years
&gt; ago and has replaced/rebuilt all the brakes,wheel cylindars,  master
&gt; cylindar, fuel pump, fuel tank.  But pretty much it is still in the original
&gt; condition.  He is throwing in a bunch of parts including a clutch plate,
&gt; cables, ect.
&gt;
&gt; the compression is low at 75, 95, 84, 79.  Obviously it needs a rebuild.  I
&gt; believe then engine is a 1200 36HP single port.  The owner stated that the
&gt; parts are hard to find to rebuild that motor and that it might be better to
&gt; put in a 1600.  He just kept saying its a 36 HP motor.  Aren't they all 36
&gt; hp before late 1971??
&gt;
&gt; I'd rather keep it stock and try to rebuild what is already there.  It will
&gt; not be a daily driver and we are gonna restore it and resell it as we have
&gt; too many vw's already and just want a fun winter project.
&gt;
&gt; So are those engine internal engine parts hard to find or does anyone out
&gt; there have one to sell??
&gt;
&gt; Does it sound like and OK deal for 1000.00??  The body of course is surface
&gt; rust but NO HOLES!! :)
&gt;
&gt; Is there any parts on that that are extremely expensive or hard to find that
&gt; I should check for before we buy it?
&gt;
&gt; can't wait to cruise around in such an old bus!
