&gt; The Contraption has a stock BN4 gas heater that puts out good heat but

&gt; I removed the duct with the coiled spring (next to the fuel tank) and heated
&gt; it up with a heat gun to see how it worked.

&gt; I adjusted mine for max control but it's not enough. Anyone ever rebend or
&gt; alter the coil to provide a longer heat run?

move the coil to a different place in the heat duct, such as near the exit
or if you have a recycling heat in the intake duct.
