+AD4-On another note, does any of our British listees happen to know if hitch
+AD4-hiking is legal in London? I have to get from Heathrow Airport to the
+AD4-Gatwick Airport both ways, and I have 5 hours to do it in. And the dang
+AD4-bus costs +ACQ-30.

Hi David, yes you can hitch hike but not many people do these days, so I
don't know how successful it will be. Also what is illegal is the stand on
the slip road (on ramp) of a motorway, so the police might move you on.
People usually manage to get away with this however. You don't want to hitch
via the minor roads as this could take forever.

I have called Heathrow and the bus service number is 0990 747777. The cost
of the bus is 14 UKP single, 18 UKP return, which is a bit less than you've
been quoted.

Enjoy your trip.
