&gt; 1)Okay. I've seen this thread before and I have tried the cheap 12V heaters
&gt; that put out about as much heat as a lightbulb. A nice afgan works better.

&gt; The question I have... is my mom used to have a GM Van.. in the back was a
&gt; 12V floor heater that pumped out mega heat... it actually worked. It was a
&gt; square box about a foot high and two feet long. 

A friend bought a beetle with a 12v floor heat5er that effectively heats 
the car. It is given that this bug has much less volume than a bus. 
However,if it is pointed at the driver it will warm them, and convection 
may bring warm air up to the windshield. Also, the behind the seat 
barrier in a previous thread would hel.This heater puts out lots of heat. 
Regarding battery usage: she hasn't killed it yet, and she used it 
through a Colorado winter last year. However, she also half the time 
forgets she has a fourth gear :), so charging is not a problem, even with 
the megawatt stereo a PO put in. I can find the brand and adress if 
anyone is interested, and get more info on how she uses it  use cycle, 
etc.
