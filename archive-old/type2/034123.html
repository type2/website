Black is the best heat _radiating_ color.  You must also consider the
insulating effect of the layer of paint.  Without some careful
experimentation, you can't really be sure which effect is greater.

However, the great majority of the heat transfer in a VW engine is via
forced convection, which is why we need that big fan and all those fins
on the engine.  Therefore, the whole &quot;What color to paint the engine&quot;
arguement might be moot.
