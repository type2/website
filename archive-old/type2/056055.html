I am pulling out the motor of my 1971 Camper Bus and this whole board thing in
the Muir Book seems a little goofy.  Could I not just throw some chain up and
tighten that down to hold up the tranny?  Is there a better way to do this?
Could I hurt anything under there if I do not have the chain in the right
place?  Why not a jack stand under there?  I do not need to move the bus but
if I did this might be a problem.
