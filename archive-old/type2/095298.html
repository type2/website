Subject: Re: : Re: [T2] Help with crankshaft endplay (it's WAY out)

Actually I've already begun the rebuild, but your reply was the best 
explanation of the situation I've read. I'll post it to the list.
Thanks.

Mick


&gt;You may already know this or have been told this, but in a worn engine, 
&gt;there are two sources of endplay.  The first is movement of the crankshaft 
&gt;w/in the bearings.  This is present in a new engine and  is adjusted w/ the 
&gt;three shims.  The second is movement of the bearings w/in the case--i.e. 
&gt;worn thrust surfaces on the case.  This is the product of wear and cannot 
&gt;be corrected w/ shims.  On a worn engine, you can't tell how much of the 
&gt;endplay is due to which source--thus it is impossible to adjust endplay on 
&gt;a worn motor.  Just use the original shims till it self destructs or, 
&gt;better yet,  repair the motor.  Good luck,

&gt;
&gt;&gt;  Three shims are required to properly center the crankshaft
&gt;&gt;in the main bearing bores. Four shims is out of the range.
&gt;
&gt;So what would happen if I put in five shims ;-)  No, seriously.
&gt;
&gt;I understand the endplay is way out of spec but oil pressure seems good (no
&gt;light at idle, even when hot). Can I squeeze by reducing the endplay to 
&gt;.006
&gt;with five shims? Will I make things worse? If I can stop the leak she'll be
&gt;no worse off than she was. Believe me, I'd rebuild this thing if it were
&gt;mine. I just want to be sure I understand all the options.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Mick
