Hi,

&gt;  Really?  But every Mercedes has an ashtray.  Let's see if I 
&gt; understand:  Smoking and driving is okay, but drinking a soda while
driving 
&gt; isn't?  Excuse me for snickering but the US Yuppies were right on in this 
&gt; case.

I think this is down to market variations. Bear in mind that the distinction
between smoking and soda-drinking is made in the law in some European
countries: this is the case in the UK (you could be prosecuted for trying 
to drive while drinking a Soda) and I expect it's also true in Germany, 
where regulation is generally tighter than here.

 I happen to agree that eating, drinking, shaving, reading newspapers,
putting on makeup etc. are incompatible with UK driving conditions,
however that may not be the case in the US, VW have now adapted their
cars for that market and maybe Dr. Tim should acknowledge that.

Cheers,
	 W.
