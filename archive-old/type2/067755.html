Subject: 043 vs 009 distributor

I've been running an 009 mechanical advance distributor in my '69 camper
for quite awhile now.  Recently, I picked up a vacuum advance distributor
for $5 at the Puyallup VW show and put it in the bus.  It seemed to
advance a little more than the 009 when I chekced it with a timing light.
Does anybody know what is the differences in the advance curves between
these two?  I had been timing the 009 at 0deg. (TDC) statically, does
anybody know how you're supposed to time the 043
distibutor?
