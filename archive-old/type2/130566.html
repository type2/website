Subject: Re: [T2] Head problems again/911 engine?

Hi Chris,

There are newer T4 aftermarket heads from Spain (AMC), and LOTS of 
fresh T1 stuff on the market. I would suggest that milage is the best 
gauge of heat cycles. And as far as heads are concerned, an engine with 
80000 miles is just as likely to fail as one with 160,000 on it. 
Refurbed heads with fresh seats are blowing up after 12000 miles or 
less. They're not all coming from GEX.... there must be another factor 
at play.

Partly driving style, partly fuel; at least as far as I can tell.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; FWIW the Corvair folks are having more dropped seats these days too. 
&gt; Their &quot;experts&quot; claim it is due to the number of heat cycles over the 
&gt; years. However, the newest Corvair (1969) is 10 years or so newer than 
&gt; the newest VW and we're all having the same problems... Hmmmmm....
