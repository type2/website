....or a Scout with an OX Locker, it is celebrating its 30th year with its 
Baywindow sibling this year, I don't know how I ended up owning two 1977 
vehicles, it wasn't on purpose, that is just what I liked, my motorcycle is 
a 1978 Honda CB750F, who knows.

&gt; You don't have to dig it out when you keep a big ol Jeep around. Just flip
&gt; the switch to those Aussie ARBs and keep rollin... Maybe they will make
&gt; airlockers for the 091 soon? Anyone at ARB listening?
