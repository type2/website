&gt; I built an engine for an old hot rod once and wanted it to run loose like 
&gt; a well broke in motor, I asked the machinist to push everything as close 
&gt; to factory tolerance as possible, essentially machining it the same as a 
&gt; worn engine.

&gt; If you do this you need a monster for an oil pump.

I had a automotive machinist tell me to do the same... it didn't sound like 
a good idea to me.. but I wasn't doing the work,, or paying for it.. all I 
was doing was driving the car.. and if he could put me in the money.. Great!

Yup.. many things taught me he was correct after the thought was in my mind!

And I also realized pressure didn't mean anything........ I had loads of oil 
volume to lubricate that engine...

a racing engine and a street engine are 2 different things though.....
