Subject: body work book

A while back, someone posted the name of the &quot;Be all, End all&quot; book to 
learn how to do body work.  I was sure that I saved the email, but of 
course I can't find it now.

Anyone have ideas?  I'm just about to order some books from Amazon, and, 
I'm just about to take my '71 off the road to do said bodywork, so it'd be 
nice to have said book.  :)

happy bussing!
