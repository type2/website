Subject: Using Kads in place of stock Solexes

Agreed the stock linkage is awful, but Scat makes a replacement linkage that
is excellent. I am surprised that there have been problems. If set up
properly with a unisync (use an appropriate size piece of PVC pipe, or juice
can to raise the height above the air cleaner bolt) these carbs provide
trouble free service year round for me. And I live in the frozen north of
Canada yet they start in the mornings in cold, or hot days. I don't
understand this, I've used them on Type1 and Type2 engines.
