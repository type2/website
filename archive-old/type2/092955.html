Subject: Installing window glass

--=====================_510913==_.ALT

There is not much to it. My wife and I installed all of the glass in our 
bus with no disasters. I was sure that the stop chip in out windshield 
would spread when we installed it but to our surprise it has not. Also 
consider springing for a new windshield. They can be had for $150. Supply 
your own seal from one of the VW aftermarket suppliers like West Coast 
Metric. We used all their seals. I have also used JC Whitney seals but they 
began to dry out and fail very quickly.

We also replaced all of flat glass with tinted glass (tint is in the glass 
not a film) from the local glass supplier. It is tempered glass just like 
the OEM VW glass. We used a light grey smoky tint. They had various tints 
and colors available. One other thing. One local shop supplied the big 
glass but could not supply the narrow Jalousie glass - too narrow they 
said. Another glass shop locally supplied it. The tinting matched.

Remove the seals by cutting the seal from the outside. You try to cut 
around the glass. This way you don't hurt the glass or the paint.

To install it you will need some 1/8&quot; string - I prefer a nylon string (not 
ski rope but more like string for drapes). You will also need a lubricant 
like silicone spray or liquid detergent (like you use to wash dishes in the 
sink with). I prefer silicone spray but I am told it will make life 
difficult when you try to repaint. On the other hand I was told that 
something in the soap will promote rust. You decide.

Also we use a plastic knife - the kind you use at a picnic. You'll use this 
on the outside of the bus and the inside to pull any small imperfections 
out of the seal - it the edge rolls under the lip of the metal inside or 
out. Never use a metal screwdriver until your some sort of pro. We still 
use the plastic knife.

Put the seal on the glass. Clean out the window opening. Locate the groove 
that the rubber seal uses to hold on to the bus. I spray silicone spray 
into this groove liberally. Then I put the string into the groove at the 
top. Lay the glass and seal onto a blanket on the floor or the work bench. 
We (my wife and I like to end the job at the bottom of the window) - I 
leave 6&quot; of string out of the groove (or more) to hold on to. Then I wrap 
the string around the window twice ending right beside where the first 
string went into the groove with some overlap. The second wrap gives you 
another chance to catch any portions of the seal that didn't want to &quot;seat&quot; 
right the first time.

Now grab your helper.

Have the helper put the window into the window opening at the top. Use that 
plastic knife to persuade the rubber seal to go over the lip of the window 
opening where it should be when you are done. Do this all the way across 
the top. Now push the window into the opening at the bottom. (Don't push 
really hard yet).

The seal should not come off of the window but it will try. It should just 
try to cram into the window opening.

Pull both string ends at the same time, at the same pace away from the 
window - for example towards the other side of the bus. Occasionally you 
may have to pull in other directions to force the rubber to go the right 
directions. Pull slowly and deliberately. Stop if you have to. You might 
want to add short pieces of wood dowel to the ends of the string to pull 
harder with.

What you are trying to do is pull the rubber lip over the metal lip of the 
window opening. Use whatever angles you feel you need to.

As this process happens the helper needs to push upward and inward. You can 
push so hard that the string is very difficult to pull out - release some 
of your pressure. The corners will be hard and require some maneuvering 
with the string to get the corners to pull right. Add more silicone 
(lubricant) if you like.

The helper will see the rubber pull into the groove between the glass and 
the steel of the bus. Do not hit the glass - steady pressure is the only 
answer here. Do not EVER use steel tools on the window. Do not push on a 
corner. You can cheat a little here but leave that for your 15th window job 
when you get cocky.

If you do not pull both strings together you stand a chance of breaking the 
glass as it and the seal are pulled into the opening. At the end of the 
string pulling (at the middle of the bottom) the force required to pull the 
strings may get harder - but as long as you are making progress you are fine.

When you are done use the plastic knife to pull out on the seal outside the 
bus where the seal doesn't want to seat properly. On the inside pull that 
lip over the edge anywhere it needs it.

On the outside make sure there are no bulges in the seal which might 
indicate a window that isn't sealed properly. Our windshield was like that 
by putting my hand on the inside of the glass and the outside of the glass 
and pushing my hands towards each other I was able to pull the glass 1/8&quot; 
towards the driver's side and it made the corner seat properly. I attribute 
that to the silicone lubricant being so slippery.

Good luck to anyone that finds this useful. It is much easier to do than 
explain in type.
