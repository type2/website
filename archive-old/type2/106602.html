Subject: I need one 1700cc head! (J or Q)

Good day guys,

After polishing 7 (yes, 7!) x  used 1700cc (# 021 101 371 Q &amp; J) heads. 
(I have one in near perfect condition), I cannot salvage/save a second 
one easily. All have crack (S), broken/stripped stud beyond repair 
(drilled  by the PO into the combustion chamber), heavily pitted 
combustion surface (Near valve and plug), or at best, crack IN the 
exhaust valve are area near the guide.

I carefully check and measure my cylinders and pistons, crankshaft /rods 
side play and rods small end, they are all well within specs. So I want 
to use those for this year until I finish my second engine.

So here I am with 1 good repairable head. Cannot buy a new or rebuilt 
one (None available anywhere, only 1.8L)

Any of you guys have one (or 2) 1.7L head in GOOD REBUIDABLE CONDITION 
(no cracks, good stud or at least good stud hole and if possible, good 
valve seat!

J or Q is fine.

Thanks, Ben
