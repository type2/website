Subject: Windshield seal replacement writeup

Or: How I said no to crack, but crack said yes to me.

I purchased the Original VW windshield/screen from the Bus Depot.

In seating the seal around my windshield, although I was being delicate and
supporting the glass, I put a crack in it on the passenger side from top to
bottom.

Being that my bus is a daily driver that gets me and two of my sons to
school/work/university, it had to go back in with the crack on it.
Frustrating.

There were some rust pinholes in the metal at the bottom of the window, and
one hole about 1/2&quot; in diameter, and some chunks of the lip which the seal
seats on broke away while I hit them with the wirewheel on my drill.

Also, I discovered that the front of my bus, below and between the headlights
contains the largest known bondo cache in the western hemispere.  And you know
that lip above the bumper where the main and lower pieces of sheetmetal are
sort of crimped together?  After grinding away all the bondo on it I
discovered it to be held together with some kind of wide-headed phillips
screws at about 10&quot; intervals.

Being the consumate body-man that I am, I promptly mixed up some JB weld and
smeared it all over the windshield holes and the lip that is slowly rotting
away at the bottom, followed by a complete front end repaint with olive drab
rattle can enamel!  I even sanded the old paint first, truly first-rate.

When the paint was pretty set, I installed my new(old) turn signals with more
orange-y, less crack-y plastic, and a N.O.S. motorola anttena which had
packaging that said &quot;Also fits 66 camper&quot;  Cool.

New sunvisors that have been in the box since I bought them on ebay a few
years ago.
Watchout!  They're TMI and don't reach to the original visor clips.  It's
called a tape measure Fokkers!

Also, I did not know to look for the very deep gap in the windshield seal that
wraps around the metal lip on the bus, so it took ten or so attempts just
wrapping the weed-wacker line around the seal in a haphazzard sort of way
before I really looked at the seal and found where the pull-line should go.

Nashville area man seeks 68-79 bus windshield,

Billy
