Subject: '71 Westy interior/exterior questions

When I bought my Westy it came with a full bed in back and the spare tire
mounted to the front end.  Beings how I'm a fanatical purist, the first thing
I did when I bought it was remove the spare tire from the front and put it
back in its rightful place inside the bus over the engine compartment.  

Now my questions...(1) what is the proper dimension for the pad that fits
over the engine compartment?  (2) is it possible to take my wide pad to an
upolstery shop and have them cut it down to proper size?  (3) what is the
proper dimension of the spare tire cover, made out of same (yellow?) material
that fits over the spare tire (shown in the original dealer's brochure I have
for the '71) and finally (4) what secures the spare tire to the side wall?
 is it a strap that fastens through the center of the tire, over the top, and
through the two brackets on the wall?  If so, what does this strap look like?
 can I buy a new one or does a hardware store sell something comparable?

One exterior question...does anyone know of a place that sells new rack bars
for the Westfalia luggage rack?  These are the bars that are riveted onto the
fiberglass luggage rack frame.  Mine have rust on them and I'd like to
replace them.
