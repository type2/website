Actually my 72 has a mechanical fuel pump that I just replaced about 100 miles
ago because of this problem i'm having again now, it went away for a while,
but I guess that may have been a conicidence.  I'm sure there is gas left in
the tank because went I went back later to get the bus, and managed to get it
started, it drove fine all the way home, thats why i'm having trouble
diagnosing it since its such an intermittent problem, but it seems to get
worse when the fuel is lower, making me think it may be at least party due to
crap in the tank.

Thanks,
Shawn
