Subject: RE: [T2] AVP/Bus Depot Engine Problem

&gt; I I purchased an engine from the bus depot and consequently
&gt; AVP who supplies them with the engines. When the distributor
&gt; is set where it's supposed to be the engine won't start.
&gt; only when the distributor is turned way out ( like 180) will it start.
&gt; My mechanic seems to think that the crankshaft wasn't aligned properly.


Erin at AVP says she had thought that Leonard had already spoken directly to
your mechanic about this, but will ask him this evening when she sees him.
The problem is probably a simple one: most likely the distributor drive gear
is inserted wrong. Your mechanic should be able to pull it out and
reposition it rather easily.  Leonard had simply wanted to talk to him to
make sure that he positioned it correctly when he put it back in.
