I always reckoned you could pump the same fuel round and round with a grunt
electric fuel pump and serious filter and maybe end up with a clean tank. Or
at least one that doesnt eat the little filters we drive with.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I have a 1979 Westy with a rusty gas tank. I can go about 100
&gt; miles before I
&gt; have to replace the fuel filter. I cut the filter in half and was
&gt; shocked to
&gt; see all of the rust in there...
&gt; Will the rust eventually flush it self out?
&gt; Is pulling the gas tank the only way to clean it?
&gt; Can I get it out without dropping the engine?
&gt; And does anyone know where I can get a new tank? (If I have to remove the
&gt; tank I'd rather put a new one back.)
