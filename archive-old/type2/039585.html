Subject: Sliding door runner maintenance/lubrication
Content-Disposition: inline

I'm in the process of (hand) painting my bus and last night took off the
sliding door cover to clean it up and paint.  There were only two screws
holding mine on, I know some have three.  It was very difficult to shift.  I
achieved it by spraying lots of WD40 oil into the grooves.  At the same
time, I got a female assistant (essential when performing magic) to hold a 4
inch square by 2 foot piece of wood along the edge of the cover.  I then hit
the wood as hard as possible with a club hammer.  It looked like it was not
going to move and then one end out, and work along to the other.  The cover
is now distorted, but should be able to straighten out.  I'm now going to
clean out the twenty years of old grease, crud and rust.
The question is: What's the best stuff to use to put on the door runner for
lubrication.  I don't want brown streaks re-appearing and I don't want to
remove the cover again.  Would petroleum jelly Vaseline do the trick?  As
it's &quot;clear&quot; perhaps it won't brown as ordinary grease.  Any tips on long
term maintenance/lubrication would be welcome.
