Subject: idles but dies?

Yesterday my daughter was driving our bus (78), it died after she slowed down.
Neither of us could restart it. Had it towed home.  This AM , I tried  it
again, and it started right off.  It ran very &quot;rough &quot; in an idle, and when I
gave it gas, it died.  After several attempts , I got it up the drive way and
after talking with my husband who's off fishing, via phone, I let it run in
the drive for 30 minutes or so.  No problem, until I tried to give it some
gas, then it just dies.  Any advise or ideas?  The fisherman is coming home
tomorrow to take a look at it! Thanks.
