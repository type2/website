Subject: Would you let someone drop/fix their engine in your garage/driveway?

Judging from the flow of posts to the list over the past two years or so, 
there are a lot of people who would like to do their own work or take 
better care of their motors, if only they had a place where they could 
drop their engine and do the work.

Maybe you have this luxury. If so, would you be willing to help a fellow 
type2 listee out? Would you be willing to do it for a fee?

I am going to put together a list of people who are willing and able. If 
this is you, would you send me a p-mail answering the following questions:

What would you charge? For a day? A weekend? A week? (Note that you might 
want some sort of &quot;in kind&quot; payment.)

What do you have? A yard? A driveway? Is the space paved or concrete? Do 
you have a garage?

What sorts of restrictions do you want to place on your generosity? 
(e.g.: don't ask to use tools, or bus has to be gone by Sunday night, or 
work only during daylight, or bring your own porta-potty.)

I will collect all the responses and devise some sort of uniform way to 
display the information on a web page. Meanwhile, I'll try to beg borrow 
or steal web space from Aqua Lung.

And, to be clear, this is an expression of self-interest.
