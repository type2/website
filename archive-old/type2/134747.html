Subject: Re: [T2] Aftermarket Fuse Boxes -70

Scott asked:


 Hello,  Does anyone know of a source of aftermarket fuse boxes for our
buses?  After having 2 used ones for my 70 bus crumble in my hands, I
thought about changing it completely out to a aftermarket 12 point box
either using German type fuses or blade type.  Any suggestions?
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

This tells me you have played with the EARLY 70 fuse boxes that were YELLOW.

Mid 70, VW made them out of the same whitish material that all the later boxes were
made of. [until they made them in black starting with the 73's]
The white nylon? ones do not split or crumble.

411 937 505A is for the 1970 bus. 

411 937 505B is for the 1971 bus. 

411 937 505C is for the 1972 bus.  

BTW, the D is for the 73 411 and the E is for the 74 412

Somewhere around here I do have a nice WHITE 70 fuse box..... they are getting very 
tough to find anymore.
