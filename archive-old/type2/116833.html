Subject: Altimeters...

&quot;&gt; and gauges - i thought i had a lot of gauges! i'll have to get an 
altimeter
&gt;now...

   If you ever get high Scott...one comes in handy when driving in the
Colorado      Rockies or even to the Grand canyon.&quot;

I believe it!  Driving north on 550 one time from Durango to Ouray my 86 GTI 
was really lugging up a hill.  I was wondering what was going on and was 
considering pulling over to do an engine check. Just then I passed a sign 
that read something like &quot;Red Mountain Pass, Elev 11,000 feet.&quot; Man, that's 
an altitude airplanes fly at!  An altimeter (or an oxygen mask) would have 
been useful.  Good thing I wasn't driving the bus...
