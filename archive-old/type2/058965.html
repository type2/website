Listee's and Sean

&gt;Because all the supporters of fuel injection drive Type 4 engined Buses

&gt;that already have it :-)
&gt;I believe Scott Allred has an aftermarket FI system in his '71 Bus.

I have a CB Performance DFI system installed -- like it a lot.  I've
been running it for almost 5 years now. Great performance and I pass
smog checks with no problems.

&gt;This is an idea.  The FI system used on the '75 and later Beetles is
the 
&gt;same as used on our '75 and later Buses, Bosch L-Jetronic.  The system 
&gt;used on the '67 and later Type 3s, though, is Bosch D-Jetronic, which 
&gt;seems to have a reputation for being finicky.  

Interestingly Todd Francis had posted a note in early July about a guy
in Oregon who has an interesting FI setup that he sells. He uses Bosch
parts from Rabbits for his system. If I remember right it is based on
CIS. If you are interested he has a site at  http://www_dot_millerfi_dot_com.
