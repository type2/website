             You might think twice before removing an old CV boot that isn't
cracked. Many of the new ones only last 6 months, then die from ozone, whereas
an old one that is
still good will last a lot longer. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. If you are
going to replace all of them, you have to make sure to get good ones. This
company has the best on the market.
