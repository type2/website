Subject: Re: [T2] wheel/tire size question...success stories?

Understood,

I understand where you're coming from here, and my intention is to keep as 
much stability in the ride as possible, while also giving a new generation 
aesthetic appeal. While making the wheel/tire swap, I plan to take into 
account the load capacity of the wheels and tires as well. I will keep the 
original wheels in case I or anyone else ever wants to return it to stock. 
Rest assured, I will not do anything to my bus that is in bad taste, but I 
guess that's all relative.
I do respect and appreciate the opinions of everyone who has a belief on 
this and all issues. Thank you for your input!

Respectfully,

Dylan Baxter

&gt;This topic often brings out the flames so watch out. IMHO there is nothing
&gt;wrong with stock rims. The problem often is that a PO has put car tires on
&gt;the bus. They dont have the sidewall thickness/ load rating your bus needs,
&gt;so your bus gets swampy. If you put a good set of stock size tires on your
&gt;stock rims and all of your suspension and steering components are in good
&gt;order then you will pretty much max out the cornering and comfort abilities
&gt;of your VW Bus. Now aestheics are another story. If you are into low
&gt;profile tires, chrome, green neon fog under your bus and maybe some
&gt;piss-boy stickers than go for it. No offense intended, I tend to take this
&gt;subject too far...
&gt;When you start changing tire size and rims you may find that your speedo
&gt;may not read correctly, and your ride becomes bumpy. I guess these things
&gt;can be corrected but it always seemed like more work than it was worth. Im
&gt;of the belief that if you want a sports car buy a sports car, if you want a
&gt;bus buy a bus but dont try to put a fifty dollar saddle on a five dollar
&gt;horse as my father used to say. (not to say that a bus is a $5 horse)...
&gt;
&gt;All of this is IMHO...
&gt;
&gt;Good Luck,
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;Hello all,
&gt;I'm new to this list, so I'm not sure if this question will offend any
&gt;purists, but I'll test the waters...
&gt;I'd like to know of any success stories that people have had with putting
&gt;non-VW wheels on their Transporters, Vanagons, etc. I have a '78
&gt;Transporter, and have recently found that some Mercedes and Audi models
&gt;have
&gt;the same lug pattern as my bus. I'd like to put some larger wheels on there
&gt;
&gt;with some low profile tires and would like to know what offsets/sizes have
&gt;been used successfully in the past by any of you.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!
&gt;Dylan Baxter
