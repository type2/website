So best, then, is to install a sender directly into the sump!.

Asunto: Re: [T2] Question about normal running oil temperature

John,

But to ask your question back to you...Where are *you* measuring it?&lt;grin&gt;

Concerns about IR sensor accuracies aside, what about the temperature
at the bottom of the oil filter on a T4...

Mine was 226 after a 50 mile run up the mountains to the Eureka show
in 100 degree weather on a new engine that started out with 4 miles on it.

The temperature(measured with the same IR meter) was a little less on the
bottom of the oil strainer plate...if I remember correctly.

Cheers, dave
