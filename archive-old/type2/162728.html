Subject: Re: [T2] engine slugging on accel

got me scratching my head,
78 2 liter auto tranny

started slowly on the way back from Everybus

. poor acceleration
. poor top speed
. engine runs normally in neutral with no load
. &quot;punch the accel&quot; and it dies, sort of sounds flooded?
. accelerate slow and smooth and it will go
. will climb steep hills, slowly

??????

. put in new fuel filter. (my first thought too)
. has a &quot;new&quot; used AFM with about 3,000 miles
.  very poor gas mileage  (10-14mpg)

thanks
Bob
