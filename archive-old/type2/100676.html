&gt; Plus I think Ron sells them at Bus Depot


Not anymore.  I did stock them for a while, but finally gave up.  It was a
huge hassle just trying to get a decent supply on a timely basis.  Too bad.
I think Ronnie at type2 parts tried his luck with them after I pulled the
plug; maybe he still deals with them.
