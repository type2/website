Subject: Insulation/WarmerBus

 I think VW originally installed fiberglass batts for insulation,
about an inch thick and unfaced (no foil or paper facing on either
side).    Mine were neither  wet nor soggy when I re-did the
interior of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, so I do not see why fiberglass insulation
could not be used in those areas.   There was no insulation at
all in the front doors, probably because water is definately going
to get into those areas and needs to be able to drain out the
bottom.  Mr. Bulley has covered this area thoroughly in his excellent
insulation and heat article.

&gt;The PO of my 67 Standard stuffed fiberglas insulation in every nook and
&gt;cranny. It is a sponge! I am replacing both front doors and both cargo
doors
&gt;because the bottoms are rusted out from this stuff. DO NOT USE IT! Unless
&gt;you can vacuum seal the plastic bags....

I considered using 'Reflextech' but called the manufacturer first and was
told
that they recommend 3/4&quot; air space between the reflextech and metal exterior
to prevent condensation.

&gt;Nick: Prior to spraying foam in the overhead, consider using the
&quot;Reflextech&quot;
&gt;or its competing product sold at many builders supply houses. It's a double
&gt;ayer of bubble wrap clad on both outer surfaces with an aluminum mylar.
&gt;Available in several widths and is attached and butt sealed with alum tape.
