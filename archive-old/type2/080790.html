I've decided to part out the 71 parts shed. It was a recent driver and =
had good brakes and a good trans when parked. has some belt line trim, =
generic looking camper seat/bed, nice front bumper with gaurds, two good =
tires, recovered bench front seats, tan interior panels frnt and rear, =
glass, lots of misc. I would prefer to sell the hard to ship stuff to =
folks who can pick it up. Or if you want the whole thing it has a clear =
title and current tags.  Located in springfield, oregon.=20
