Subject: Re: [T2] identify the canvas



&gt; I found this canvas piece in great condition in a bus. I think it might be
&gt; one of the hammocks. does anyone know for sure?
&gt;
&gt; http://www.geocities_dot_com/yultanman/canvas.jpg
&gt;
&gt; is a link to the picture of the canvas

It is the upper cot canvas for a 68 -72 or a 73 Westy.
68 -72 is the same, 73 is one-year-only.
Send me the total length measurement and the measurement from one end to the
square cut-outs and I will tell you which year it is.
