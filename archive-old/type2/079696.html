Subject: Re: [T2] gas tank/fuel sender clues

Hi Dave,

On the 73 and 79 buses I have worked on, the fuel sender is on the top. I
have seen buses where a PO has cut a 6&quot; square access panel in the rear deck
to access the sender. Not pretty, but it saves a lot of trouble getting the
firewall and hold-down straps undone.

The tank can be removed without dropping the engine. I have done it and it
is easier than most people admit. I guess it depends on whether you prefer
to take the engine out to dismantling the fuel system.

Start by removing everything on top of the motor. If possible, take a lot of
pictures so you will know precisely how to put things back where they were
when you are done. Mark connections with tape and bag and tag any fasteners
you remove. Next remove the screws holding the firewall in place. If the
firewall hasn't been out before it could take a fair bit of force to break
it loose. Wear gloves, as the sharp metal edges can cut you once the thing
finally lets go. Next you will have to remove the fuel tank filler hose,
which is somewhat of a PITA to get loose... and even worse to get back on
again. Be careful not to be too rough with that hose as you don't want to
tear it; they're hard to find. Now remove the hose at the bottom of the tank
and drain whatever fuel remains into a basin or small jug. At this point the
tank should move freely when pushed from side to side, and can be wiggled
out of position and slid out the engine hatch over the top of the naked
motor.

When I pulled the tank to swap it out on the 79 bus with the 73 engine, I
had to remove the mustache bar bolts and drop the rear of the engine about
an inch to fit the tank out. No big deal.

Happy trails,

&gt; Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; I am pulling my engine and gas tank tomorrow.
&gt; 
&gt; 78 t2 std trans
&gt; 
&gt; Does the fuel sender hole face the front or rear of the vehicle.
&gt; 
&gt; If the tank is &quot;square&quot; does the sender come out of the top?
&gt; 
&gt; The point is, if it faces the rear or top, can I get it out with the fuel
&gt; tank still in the car and feel around inside the tank before I have to
&gt; take the whole thing out?...yes, I am lazy...if I can feel around inside
&gt; the tank without having to pull it, then maybe I can figure out what is
&gt; covering the hole to the fuel pump and just take it out.
&gt; 
&gt; On the other hand, if such a thing is possible, and I feel all sort of
&gt; gunk in there, then I won't mind pulling it all anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; I just have visions of pulling everything only to find a pristine looking
&gt; tank with a piece of saran wrap or something similar floating around in
&gt; it.....probably not a chance in hell, but I gotta ask.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers, dave
