&gt; &gt; So, we just bought a new VW to go along with our old.  Some part of me
&gt; &gt; really wants to put cheezy &quot;My other car is a Volkswagen&quot; plate frames
&gt; &gt; on each.  Anybody know of places that make plate frames to order?
&gt;
&gt; The shopping mall! :-)

Actually, I have the equipment to do this sort of thing, inherited from my
father.  Unfortunately, it is not set up and is not likely to be soon.

Look in the phone book under &quot;engraving&quot; and find a place that does
trophies, name badges, architectural signs, etc.  They can order the
frames from their raw material suppliers and engrave them with whatever
you wish.
