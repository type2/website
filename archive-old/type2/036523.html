Subject: Need 68-71 Bus parts

Hello everyone!

I have a problem and I'm turning to the list for help.  My Frankenstein crew 
cab with the Corvair drive train is having troubles.  Here's what I need.  I 
need to find a donor bus from 1968-1971 so I can get the rear fenders (mine 
are cut out) , complete engine compartment sheetmetal, engine with mounts , 
and tranny with axles and mounts.  If I have to I can get by with a later 
year tranny (prefer 75 and later) and any year complete dual port engine.  
Yes, the COrvair drivetrain is coming out!  
I live in tampa, Florida but could travel within a respectable distance to 
get the needed parts.  Can anyone assist me here?
Thanks,

Dave
