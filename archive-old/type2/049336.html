Sounds remarkably like a cylinder full of fuel.  Pull the two plugs on
that side of the engine, remove the little wire from the coil to the
distributor, get your fire extingusher out and crank the engine.  I'll
bet that it'll now turn over and pump a quart of fuel out.  After the
fuel has evaporated, put it all back together and it'll probably
start.  

It sounds like the float needle is stuck on that carb... Might want to
rap it smartly on top of the float chamber with a screwdriver handle.

Good luck, and BE CAREFUL!!!

&gt; So, this morning I got up.  Decided to give it one more try.  Same thing.
&gt; CrrChunk!!!  So, I thought, hmmmm...  I'm going to try to hand turn the
&gt; engine....  I could turn it backwards just fine, but it would not turn
&gt; forwards past a certain point.  I couln't tell exactly where I was in the
&gt; cylindar cycle, but I was not at TDC anything.
&gt; 
&gt; So as I'm looking at this, I notice that there is a large puddle of
&gt; something underneath the engine, that smells remarkably like gasoline. 
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; So after the gas stopped leaking, I went back to look at the engine.  For
&gt; some reason I could get it to turn now, but when I reached that same point,
&gt; I heard a chattering sound, like air/liquid trying to escape.  I backed it
&gt; off and did it again.  Same sound.  In the many hours I've spent turning the
&gt; engine while Landon adjusts and readjusts the valves, I've never heard this
&gt; sound.  It was coming from the left side of the engine, and I'm pretty sure
&gt; from valve/cylindar #3, but I don't know where in the system.
