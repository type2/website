Subject: Re: [T2] cross drilled drums

&lt;&lt; Hey guys, many of the hot rod guys here at work who can't find or afford to
put disks on their rods have the same basic brake problems as we do and
what they are doing is having holes drilled in the drums kinda like cross
drilled disks, you get the idea i think.  anyway, they are reporting much
less fade when comming down hills and in repeated stops so this might be
something us dubbers might look into instead of spending mega bucks on disk
brake systems.
 &gt;&gt;

I'd be a little more than leery about DIY changes to brake components...Cross
drilled rotors are not a DIY project and I tend to think drilling holes on a 
brake
drum might fail into the same catagory...How many holes? How large? What
would the spacing be before the benefits of cooling are undermined by the
weakening of the drum...That said, I did modify Datsun 240 Z rear drums to
fit my Morgan...Sort of a latter day &quot;Alfin&quot; upgrade... :-)
