In my last Westy, I had 6x9's in the doors and hated it.  I can't tell you
how many times I kicked the driver side speaker.  Both speakers eventually
tore / split the thin door panels.

I am thinking of replacing my kickplate with wood and was considering
mounting the speakers, like Dave, near the headlights.  Would that work?

&gt; &gt; Greetings all,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm looking at having a stereo system installed in my '74 Westy.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There doesn't seem to be much to support the radio inside the dash.  I'm
&gt; &gt; almost positive that I'll be putting some 6x9's under the couch, but not
&gt; &gt; sure of where to put speakers in the front.
&gt;
&gt; Well, I bought a Blaupunkt in-dash cd with AM\FM.  It fit nicely, after I
cut
&gt; out about a 1/4 on each side.  It is flush with the front of the dash, and
I
&gt; used none of the mounting hardware.  I think the heater controls help hold
it
&gt; up, but it's mostly held in by the dash itself.  (I am also incredibly
&gt; intrigued by the glove box mount seen in magazines.  The only problem is
that i
&gt; don't know if I want to take my G.B. door off)
&gt;
&gt;     My speakers were set right on top of the dash for ease of
installation, but
&gt; I'll be moving them this year.  People say to put them in the door, but I
don't
&gt; really like that.  It's wet in my doors because I need window seals.  I'm
&gt; thinking I'll build small boxes to put them under the dash near the
headlight
&gt; buckets.  My speakers (6&quot; round) are also Blaupunct.
&gt;
&gt;     Rear speakers are another story.  I don't want to install them
anywhere,
&gt; because I'd have to cut my panels, and I'd lose my wonderful westy storage
&gt; space.  I wonder about mounting them in the top, maybe with hinges so they
&gt; would flip up when the top was up, and attach to the front cross bar, on
either
&gt; side of the canvas window.  I don't know.
&gt;
&gt;     What have other people done with westy sound?
