&gt; &gt; &gt; Somebody was asking for one of these recently. I found two over the
&gt; &gt; &gt; weekend -- people pull the dizzies at the yards and leave the springs
&gt; &gt; &gt; behind. I fish 'em out with my fingernail. And I'm always looking for
&gt; &gt; &gt; more.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I wonder if these springs are specific to certain timing curves?  I
&gt; &gt; would't be surprised if this were true seeing how there are different
&gt; &gt; curves specified in the bentley manual.
