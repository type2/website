Eric:
This is pretty normal in the rust belt, and getting closer in other areas.
Moderate rust could be repaired by welding, but pay special attention to the
mounting area of the third arm (center link). These get rusty and BREAK OFF,
usually during parking/ low speed maneuvering.
The best fix is a new beam from a rust free bus in a junk yard.
The types are:
68-69
70
71-79
70's are like the later ones, except they don't have the booster brackets for
the power brakes. A good welder could add/ remove to make fit.
68-69 are completely different (smaller where the beam mounts to the frame)
Changing beams is a good bit of work.
Write back if you have question, there's good stuff in the archives, but
right now, I believe the archives are not functioning!
Good luck,
Al Brase
