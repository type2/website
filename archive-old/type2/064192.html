Things just weren't the same without you. ;) Let me make sure I have this right:

&gt;I brought back a 25 long block,
&gt;with the heads already removed, but the cylinders are stuck solid.   The
&gt;bottom of the case was corroded from the old oil turning acidic or something,
&gt;and had holes in it, which I enlarged with a hammer.

You dragged an engine all the way back from England. A rusty engine with
holes eaten in it.

(Did you check the thing as luggage or was it carry-on? How did the bomb
squad feel about this?)

Then when you got it back you went after it with a hammer and knocked
*bigger* holes in it.

Some of the things you people do on this list would have a psychologist
wondering whether all your fruit loops were still in the bowl. ;)
