Subject: My first Bus Depot order - part 2

Hello again,
For those who are interested, my first Bus Depot order has arrived.  To =
my surprise
it arrived in 4 days, and I live on the West Coast.  I ordered on  =
Tuesday Nov.27=20
and it arrived on Friday.  I received 19 of the 20 items (I was told on =
the phone=20
when ordering that the last item would go on back order.  Even says on =
the bill,=20
&quot;will be quite awhile.&quot;) and everything appears to be in good condition.
So my first first (yes, first first) hand experience with Bus Depot has =
been very=20
positive.  Easy ordering on the phone, cheap prices, and timely =
shipping.  As=20
for quality of the parts, time will tell, but I haven't heard too many =
complaints=20
there from this list.
Thanks for listening.

-'72 Westy

&gt;I dialed direct, opting not to use the 800 number, since I had some =
questions.
&gt;The on-phone experience was easy and rather pleasant.  I spoke with a =
rather
&gt; nice young (sounding) man named Andy.  Andy took the order and =
verified
&gt;my parts numbers matched his part (so I get what I expect to get.)  He =
then,
&gt; on my request, checked to see what was in the warehouse.  Anything =
that=20
&gt;would delay the shipment, went on back order so I would (will) get =
everything
&gt; else a.s.a.p.  And one item is to be drop shipped direct from the =
supplier. =20
&gt;In all, I ordered 20 items totaling about $426, paid with Visa.
&gt;
&gt;Ordering was easy.  Will it arrive in the &quot;promised&quot; 7-10 days?  We =
shall see.
