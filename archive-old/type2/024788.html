&gt; Where's the &quot;throttle body&quot;? How do I remove and clean it?

Michael,

remove the air filter box and the big S-shaped hose between air filter and
throttle body, then disconnect the accelerator cable. There may or there may
not be a FI microswitch attached under the throttle body. If so, just
disconnect the multiprong connector.

Now, two screws hold the throttle body to the air distributor, one towards
the rear, which is easy to access, and one towards the front (FIF), wedged
between the throttle body and the fire wall. That one is a real PITA to get
to, but with patience and/or a little temper tantrum you'll get it. There's
a rubber seal between the throttle body and the air distribution box that
may need a little bit of attention. Make sure it's well positioned when you
put the throttle body back in, so you don't create vacuum leak there.

You could also check the microswitch and adjust it if necessary. I believe
it controls the EGR (turns it off at idle as well as at full throttle; your
idle problem *could* come from there.)

When cleaning the throttle body, make sure the small vacuum port(s) for the
distributor are clear. (But those can also be cleaned without removing the
throttle body: just blow some solvent and air through the vacuum line.)

Enjoy :)

Sami
