Subject: Re: [T2] Engine to Tranny - 3 bolts?

Perhaps they meant to say held on with 3 studs, as there is 3 studs and 1
bolt. Yes, I'd use all four but have something welded to the starter bolt so
it wont turn or use a 'D' headed bolt, dum dum or whatever. Really helps to
clean the threads on both nut and bolt so they go on like butter until you
can torque it down. Just cuz it may come with 3 or 2 dont make it right,
think of all the other wrong things you find!

&gt; &gt; I also pulled the engine from my '71 bus and I had the Bentley manual

surprised
&gt; &gt; when I read in the Bentley manual that on the '71 bus ONLY 3 BOLTS HOLD
THE
&gt; &gt; ENGINE TO THE TRANSMISSION! The &quot;How to Rebuild. . .&quot; book said that the
&gt; &gt; upper left bolt had to be removed from underneath. This is the same bolt
not
&gt; &gt; referenced by the Bentley manual - apparently the one that is not
needed?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Since the books seem to contradict each other, which one is correct?
Does a
&gt; &gt; stock '71 only need 3 bolts? If so I'd like to leave the upper left off
due
&gt;
&gt; I always had all four in my 71 IIRC and I have always felt like a VW
&gt; engine wasn't held in tight enough for my nervous self. (no never had one
&gt; fall out)  so I would be anal about putting in all four, but the right
&gt; size and yes they are a relatively minor PITA to get in and out.
