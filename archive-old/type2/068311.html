Subject: Re: Plugs &amp; Compression testing

&gt; 
&gt; 1) When changing plugs, I've alway been told it is best to do it on a
&gt;    COLD ENGINE to reduce the risk of stripping the head.  Okay, simple enough
&gt;    to swap plugs on a cold engine...
&gt; 
&gt; 2) When checking cylinder compression, I'm always been told to do it on a WARM
&gt;    ENGINE.  This is obviously correct, since only when the engine is warm will
&gt;    tolerances be correct, etc, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; So you see the source of my confusion.  The two rules are mutually exclusive.
&gt; 
&gt; Does this mean then that it is *preferable* to pull plugs from a cold
&gt; engine, but that I shouldn't particularly worry when removing them from a
&gt; warm one?  Does it mean that the temperature of the motor is in no way
&gt; associated with likelihood of plug stripping?  Have I just been feed a load
&gt; of hooey about when it's best to pull the plugs?

What this means is,

If you remove the plugs from an engine while it is warm and thenput in 
new ones, When the engine cools and shrinks, it will strain the threads 
and maybe cause the spark plugs to seize up. I am pretty sure that the 
case material expands more than the steel for a given amount of heat. I 
would not worry about doing the compression check.IT IS SUPPOSE TO BE 
DONE on  A WARM OR HOT ENGINE. Also , all the spark plugs are supposed to 
be removed from the case when checking compression. I f you have a 
problem with the above, warm the engine, remove all spark plugs, check 
the compression on all four cylinders, wait for the engine to cool down, 
and replace all the spark plugs - there, your done.

Im done - my 2 cents

PS - I invite corrections over why it is bad to replace spark plugs on a 
warm engine -  not sure I have the right answer, but I believe I am close.
