Subject: RE: all of a sudden...

&gt;all of a sudden I have no power. Hills that I could make at 50 to 55 mph 
&gt;in 4th need 3rd gear now at 35mph. My mpg has decreased to around
&gt;13-14 mpg. When I accelerate, there is a sound that resembles an 
&gt;exhaust leak. The exhaust system doesn't appear to be holey (it is 
&gt;only 2 years old). Any ideas on what could be responsible for this 
&gt;drastic change? Any ideas on what to check first?

Could be a lot of different things.  But the loss of power coupled with loud
'exhaust' type sounds most likely indicates a leak in one of the combustion
chambers.  Check to make sure all your spark plug wires are on tight.  Then
check to make sure all your spark plugs are in tight.  Then I'd do a
compression check on all 4 cylinders.  Your troubles could be due to a
burned valve, loose heads, loose spark plug, or a hole in a piston. 

If you were just experiencing loss of power, I'd suspect your points need
adjusting/replacing and/or your timing is off.  Or maybe a carburetor
problem.  And the noise alone would almost certainly be an exhaust leak.
But the 2 combined?

Hope it turns out to be something easy, cheap, and simple!
