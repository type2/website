Subject: flyers

72 Westy raises a question about tranny rebuilders, which
got me thinking. In the VW rags out there, I see trannys
called &quot;freeway flyer&quot;. What's that all about - saving your
motor or saving on gas or both? I see lots of freeway/highway
miles in my future.
I'm thinking my '71 is getting a little tired. I thought I would
stick with a stock rebuilt/new but this FF has me intrigued. 
Anybody out there, my age (49), have experience with these 
aftermarket transmissions?
Say - anything to look out for when changing shocks on a 71' Westy?

Thanks,

Pete
