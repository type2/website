Subject: Help me split the case!!!

 I'm slowly tearing into the junk yard 1981 or 1982 2.0L engine that I
 may or may not end up rebuilding, and it's time to split the case.

 Tom Wilson's book &quot;How to Rebuild Your Volkswagen Air-Cooled Engine&quot;
 says &quot;there are 20 case parting-line fasteners on the Type 4.&quot;

 Here's my count of fasteners so far:
                                                   Cumulative
 ----------------Description---------------------- --Count--
 1 small bolt/nut at lower front of engine
   behind flywheel                                     1
 4 studs/nuts along bottom of engine                   5
 1 long bolt in the middle of left side lifters        6
 1 stud/nut below oil cooler                           7
 2 studs/nuts surrounding oil pump                     9
 2 studs/nuts surrounding rear oil seal               11
 1 long bolt/nut at top rear, below breather          12
 2 small studs/nuts to left of breather               14
 5 bolts/nuts along top of engine                     19
 6 large bolts/nuts surrounding crank bearings        25

 so don't believe everything you read in books!

 Anyway, who ever put the engine together the last time used what
 looks like a &quot;form a gasket&quot; sealer; the case has a red rubbery
 substance exuding from all along the case parting-line, and if feels
 glued together.  My first tentative attempt to part the case ended up
 with no progress; I'd swear there's still a bolt in there somewhere!

 Any secrets/tips/tools/techniques that makes parting a case easy?
 I've dreamed up a &quot;tool&quot; using a coupling nut and a pair of bolts
 that I think I could use to &quot;push apart&quot; the case at the piston
 holes, but maybe someone has already solved this problem!

 TIA.
