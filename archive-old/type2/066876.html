Subject: lock, trans plug

Hiya everybody
    I have a few questions. 
#1 i changed my trans mission fluid and i noticed i do not have a magnetic
drain plug my bus is a 71. In all my beetles i have noticed the magnetic
plug is there a reason why its not in my bus. If there isn't i have a few
and i'll put one in next time i change the fluid. Also it seems to be
leaking from around the parts the cv joint bolts onto is there a seal behind
there. I am pretty sure its not the one in the bellhousing or a lose plug.

#2 we can't find the keys to the 76 westy my dad is working on. I remeber
someone metioning some numbers on the lock that can be used to have a key made?
we also have a 71 bus does any one know if the swicth part will fit in the
76 it is not on the road rite now we put a upright engine in it because we
had a spare and his lack of funds and it was a pretty cheap purchase however
a key is a desirable feature in a bus.

Thanx everyone
Phil Burton
71bus/super beetle
