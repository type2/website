Subject: Vanagon Gas Smell (Leak?)

Oh Oh? Just noticed a few days ago that I was getting a strong odor of 
gas inside the 81 Vanagon. It is especially bad up near the front seat 
area. I noticed the smell also coming through the fresh air vents. It 
also seemed to get worse if I opened the front windows and vent. I did 
the smell test around the vehicle and noticed nothing in the engine 
compartment area. Seems to be coming from the front. I noticed the smell 
from the fuel filter/ fuel pump area.
        I got underneath the van yesterday and took off the 12 or so 
screws holding on the metal panel covering the fuel filter/fuel pump. 
The fuel filter was leaking from the seam very slowly. Yes! No big deal. 
I had an extra filter in the van. I gave it a day to dry out and today 
took it for a test drive.
        Seemed to be better at first but after 5 minutes I was getting 
sick from the smell again. It seemed to get worse after starting the 
engine and driving. Now I notice the smell lingers under the drivers' 
side front wheel well. Perhaps the expansion tanks, hoses or (please no) 
the fuel tank is rusted through. Either tomorrow or this weekend I will 
pull the tank. Haynes has a good description and picture. I also have 
found some help by Jack Reed here:

        If anybody has any ideas or input before I pull the tank please 
respond to me personally or to the type 2 (aircooled group). TIA.
