Folks,

With advance apologies to H. Steve and the other hard working
administrators...I know this is probably a Friday topic, however, it's kind
of time sensitive.  I just got an idea that might work - somehow.

The Harley guys make a toy run every year here in Southern Calif.  Why can't
we do something along the same line?  Buy a toy or two, and we take a drive
somewhere like 50 or 100 miles to deliver - or to have a bbq and hand the
toys over to the Salvation Army, Toys For Tots, Boys and Girls
Clubs...somebody who can distribute them to others.  Opinions?

I know there are a couple of vintage bus clubs here: SOTO and OCTO, and they
might want to get in on the action.  Kind of a &quot;United Busses for Kids.&quot;  I
do know we don't have a LIMBO chapter around - or any club for late model
buses.  I've heard people are interested.  What do we need to do?  Could
this be a good opportunity to start one?  I'm not employed right now, so I
can give a little time toward starting one, but don't really know how much
time is necessary to keep one going.

Maybe Busses at the Boulders is a good place to discuss this.  Let me know
your thoughts.  I think OCTO, Orange County Transporter Organization, could
probably get the word out and get 50 to 75 busses to do a drive.  I don't
know about SOTO.  Even if we could only get 50 or 75 busses total...what an
impact that might have going down the road...and then handing over a bunch
of toys - think how good you'd feel!!  Folks could come from Arizona for the
weekend...Okay, I'm dreaming, now, but big dreams are good, right?

Please let me know what you think.  If you would like to do it.  And, if it
can be pulled off in a month...or, is it too late?  Anxious to hear from
you.  I think a decision will have to be reached within the next 5 or 6 days
for any planning to take place.

And, maybe it's not time for a club, but we can do something for the
Kids...so many will have so little at Christmas.

Thanks,
Phil
