I only get my email at work so I'm coming into this late.  Sorry Steven.
I'm an electronics engineer, I design various bits and pieces for mobile
radio systems, mainly for emergency services and transportation.  My
specialist area has become mobile data and vehicle tracking (using GPS etc).
I mostly work on my bus myself but I don't like jobs involving crawling
around on my back up to my armpits in dirt and grease (ie most jobs really).
You are all great folks on the list and I appreciate you.

I must apologise for the waffle at the bottom of this message, my sys admin
seems to have added it recently, I will see if I can find a way of not
sending it.
