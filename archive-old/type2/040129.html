Subject: Pulley, too much play?

Volks: 
I just replaced the pulley on my new 71 Westy. It seems to have too much 
play. The replaced pulley fits a lot tighter. How much play is acceptable? 
This is the first time that I replace one of this and maybe may standards are 
too high. Any comments will be appreciated.
