Look under the dashboard and remove the white nylon plug that holds the lever onto the mechanism then the levers pull straight. 
But while you've got your head there to see what you are doing then you might as well change the bulbs without removing the dash. 
I found the clips that the 4 screws in dash corners go into are a real $*_at_!! to get back in place - disconnect you battery while putting them back otherwise they may fall onto the light switch and cause a short circuit. 

Good luck

&gt; sorry 'bout that... it just came to me and i couldnt resist... 
&gt; 
&gt; oh mighty and all-knowing list.... 
&gt; how the H**L do i get the vent levers off the dash of my 70 bus so i can 
&gt; remove the dash to change the tiny lightbulbs? do the lever ends slide 
&gt; out or do i have to undo something under the dash first? i was so excited 
&gt; to get these lightbulbs so i might finally be able to see my speedometer 
&gt; at night!!! now i cant get to it... i am bummed. 
&gt; 
&gt; thanks for your help!
