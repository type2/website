Subject: Free Bus gone

As of Saturday at 16:00 local, the free bus in
northern Virginia is now at a junkyard.

The junkyard is Banks in Stafford Virginia.

It is still on the tow truck.  It will not be put
in the yard until Monday.

The junk yard man says the front axle beam is
$225.

I don't know what the chrome bumpers will be
priced at, nor the transmission, fuel pump, etc.

Sorry to all, even myself..

I first saw this '78 bus (not Westy) on Wednesday,
veterans day holiday.  (from a recommendation of a
mailman)  Talked with grumpy old man.  He said it
'goes this weekend'  Tow it out of here for free.

I went back on Friday noon.  Talked with one of
the sons.

I went back at 15:00 Saturday, and grumpy old man
said it was towed on Saturday.  It was
free........  so sad   :-(

For Mike Benthin, et al. the '76 is still at
Merrifield VA, and Tim (the owner) still has not
gotten around to pull this engine for his kit
car!!  I saw him at 11:45 Saturday.  I will check
on the way to church today.  (The rolling hulk is
not free.  Tim makes grumpy old man look like
Santa Claus!!  Still, a nice -not chrome- front
bumper, and 3 of 4 hub caps are decent!!!))
