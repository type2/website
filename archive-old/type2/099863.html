Subject: Re: [T2] Portable propane heater report

I have both the Mr. Heater and the Coleman Powercat.  The only issue with
using these inside the bus is the water that is given off.  My windows fog
up very quickly.  Once I get moving the condensation isn't so bad.  The
Powercat is nice to use up front due to the fan.  It can blow the warmer air
right on you.  The Mr. Heater model is great for the back part of the bus.
It get's nice and toasty after about 15 minutes.  The rated run times are at
the absolute lowest settings and you have to make sure that there is some
fresh air coming into the bus.  I open my vent about 1/4 of the way and it
has worked out great.  I haven't used them while camping yet and I'm not
sure that I want to while I'm sleeping, but they do keep the bus warm and
there is no problem using them while moving.
