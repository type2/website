Subject: Re: [T2] trip from illinois to washington state, upcoming

Oooooooooooo, 80psi in one cylinder brings back bad memories of my Ex-80
Vanagon.  Had the same thing in #1 and it lead to a burnt valve &amp; dropped
seat.  Not fun, happened about 50 miles from home, but I was able to limp
back.  Ever try replacing the right side head (#1 &amp; 2 cylinders) with the
engine still in?  It can be done, but not without a lot of cussing, skinned
knuckles, blood &amp; sweat.

Try the valve adjustment procedure that doktortim outlines to re-check the
compression in the 80psi cylinder.  If it's still 80, pull the head, check
and replace valves (and maybe the seat(s)) as necessary.

&gt; hello all,
&gt; i am a very new vanagon owner (a 1980 campmobile), just about one month,
&gt; and a less-than-novice mechanic. i've been working on making what repairs
&gt; seem necessary and am planning on driving it out west to washington state
&gt; in
&gt; about a week. i am nervous about it having major problems and would like
&gt; advice on what seems really necessary.
&gt; here's what i know:
&gt; * the muffler is weak, old, rusty. the tailpipe fell off and i got a new
&gt; one
&gt; welded on, but not a new muffler.
&gt; * there are major oil leak/burn problems. it is in the shop today to
&gt; determine the level of these problems and what needs done.
&gt; * the engine isn't compressing fully in all cylinders. (80-120-120-120).
&gt; * tires. maybe i need new tires to be able to get over the mountains and
&gt; almost definite snow?
&gt; beyond the known things, any other suggestions/worries? as for the known
&gt; things, any advice? do i need a new muffler? do i need new tires? should i
&gt; get a new engine, or just try and fix the leaks in the current one and
&gt; wait
&gt; it out? (the engine has only 85,000 miles on it, which is part of my
&gt; hesitation to get a new one).
&gt;
&gt; any and all advice would be appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; thank you.
