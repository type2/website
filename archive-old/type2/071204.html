Hello,

Scott Allred was wondering how difficult it would be to replace
the sidecover seals on his '71.  I wouldn't say that it is too
difficult if you have the 8mm triple square socket to get the CV
joint bolts out, a pair of bevel cut snap ring pliers for the ring
that retains the CV flange onto the differential stub axle,  a
puller for the seals that can go around that stub axle, and a
driver for the new seals that will fit over the stub axle snout. 
I'd guess and say that laying on the ground under the Bus
with the proper tools this job would take about 3-4 hours for
both sides.  Considering that Elring brand final drive seals
(German) would be about $5 each and the mechanic wants
$85 per side (or $80 in labor) then that should give you an
idea of how much 'fun' this job would be.
