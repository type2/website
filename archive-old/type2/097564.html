Subject: Re: [T2] A little (heater) relay help!

&gt;      It's Sunday and I'm trying to get my heating system to work.  I can't
&gt; seem to make the blower motor go.  I've got juice flowing back there as far
&gt; as the relay.  The little red wire with the fuse goes into the block that
&gt; plugs onto the relay has power, but the yellow &amp; brown (I think brown) wire
&gt; that goes to the heater blower connector is not lighting up my test light.
&gt; Does this mean the relay is kaput, is there a way to test the relay?

No, it usually means you are missing the 2nd power to it. A normal relay has 4
terminals: 30, 85, 86, and 87. The 73 thru 75 wiring diagram shows M as 30, 31
as 85, A as 86, and J as 87.
A relay has 2 circuits: a coil controlled by 85 and 85 and the main power in
and out [30 and 87]. The red wire should be 30 and the yellow brown is 87.

&gt; Is there something else I should look at?  Is there another wire going into
the relay that should have juice?

Yes, the blue wire [A, which is 86]. This is the coil power. It comes from the
voltage regulator. Are you testing for power with the key on but the engine is
off? If yes, you have to have the engine running to have alt output to
energize this wire. [later buses use key-on B+ for this, they do not require a
running engine]

The brown/white stripe wire going to the switch up front is a ground circuit.
The switch goes to ground to close the relay.
To check this: connect your test light to positive and the brown/white wire.
Move your red lever all the way down and the light should come on.

&gt; Also, is there a source for these relays?

I really don't believe you need one.
