Subject: Nifty pushrod tube remover!
Message-ID: &lt;3755ECDC.F9310B1_at_west_dot_net&gt;

I suppose when I get more experience under my belt and have the balls to
remove &amp; install gland nuts with a chisel like Muir, then I will
fearlessly use the Vice Grips to remove pushrod tubes.

What worked for me was an 8'' nylon webbed strap, about an inch wide. I
looped this over the pushrod tube, gripped it close the the tube with
the Vice Grips and by carefully twisting and pulling I was able to free
the tubes without much trouble.

Reinstallation was much the same, though I found that applying pressure
on the end of the tube with a deep wall socket sped things up
considerably.

YMMV

(Also, I went to the salvage yard and got the pushrod tube springs,
though I can't see what good they could possibly do...the tubes seem
disinclined to go much of anywhere. I also did not try installing the
springs between the head and the rocker arm assembly as did the PO, such
that torquing the rockers leaves impressions of the springs on the head,
but rather followed the photo in Bentley &amp; clipped the springs in the
slots below the rockers. Sure hope they don't sproing loose and cause
some kind of adventure.)
