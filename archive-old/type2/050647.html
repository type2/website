NKG all the way. I have found too many defective Bosch plugs to recommend
them anymore. NGK is a better unit all the way.

Bosch defects include misfires (bad internally) and bad threads (out of the
box), which promptly stripped a friend of mines plug hole on a brand new
$1200 racing HEAD (not plural).

We only sell NGK, they are around $.50more per unit than Bosch, which is
chump change IMO.
