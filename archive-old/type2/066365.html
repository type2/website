&gt;&gt; '68 was just velvet green or white, I believe both were available
&gt;&gt; in either trim.  And when did the red become available?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;I was referring to Westy colors by only Velvet Green and White,
&gt;but as I asked, when did the Red WESTY come about not the
&gt;station wagon model.

The Titian Red Westy was available in 1970 &amp; 1971.
