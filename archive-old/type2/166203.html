Subject: Re: Side window seal

I had the same problem last winter so I did the duct tape test. It turns 
out the leak is from my windshield seal and has nothing to do with the 
door.

&gt; For the second time on a row, I have opened my door to find that water is
&gt; draining out of it! I figure it is because the water that it hitting 
&gt; my side
&gt; roll-down windows is simply dibbling down to the bottom and the 
&gt; running out
&gt; the door when I open it.
