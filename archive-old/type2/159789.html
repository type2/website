Subject: Re: [T2] Help w/ my '78...

Firing order is 1-4-3-2 as engine goes clockwise.
A pop that blows off the hoses suggests a gas ignition while the intake 
valve was still open- ie, you either have a cylinder firing at the wrong 
time or your ignition timing is really off??  Remember that with FI all 
the injectors are firing with each pulse from the coil; the right mix 
sweeps into the cylinder that is opening.
Backfires are Very bad as the flapper in your air flow meter can be 
pushed out of alignment or even break as mine did once after spraying 
starter fluid in air intake!  Much safer to do the latter into the 
airbox AFTER the throttle valve- spray it into a hose attached to the 
airbox.  Did you make sure when valve covers were off that you have the 
wires for each cylinder  in the right spot (to fire) when (clockwise 
rotating) rotor is approaching that wire on the COMPRESSION stroke (ex 
closed and intake valve open and closing as TDC is reached) as someone 
helps you rotate the engine via a 7/8&quot; wrench on the alternator nut?
If doing this with #1, you only need a voltmeter to statically time good 
ballbark area-either check for voltage getting to coil, or just 
continuity across points as they approach closing.

  Just to make sure I'm doing this right, the firing order should now be
  3-2-1-4, correct?

  Also, at one point while turning over the engine I heard a pop, went
  back to check it out and a lot of the vacuum lines were blown off.  In
  fact it blew the part that holds the air filter off the s boot, and it
  was on tight. What might cause that?
