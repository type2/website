&gt; Anyone have an idea on how to calibrate the speedometer. Mine does jerk

2 easy ways to check speedo.

1. find one of the automatic speed traps that have a big sign that tell
you what your speed is,  (the police might even tell you where they have
one)  and drive through it at varying speeds.  remember most eddy current
speedos (like the VW's)  generally have a higher error at higher speeds. 

2.  find one of those measured miles on the road, most every state has
bunches of em. and take a stop watch,  drive through one at a constant
speed and time yourself exactly.   at 60MPH you need 60seconds, at 45 you
need 90 seconds, 30MPH = 120 seconds etc... easy math.


I know for example mine reads 6% high, did it both ways and the error is
consistant.  so at 50 on the speedo I'm only doing 47....pretty close .

also remember if you change tires your speedo will read differently.
bigger tires = slower reading,  smaller tires = faster reading.  mine was
probably reading slower than actual speeds until I put the big 205R70X14
tires on her.


YMMV
