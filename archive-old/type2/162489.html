&gt; Bob,
&gt; Ah...ha   2/3 power, not total loss.....

no not a total loss.

&gt; Time to pull those injectors and send them off to Richard's favorite
&gt; place...?cruizin performance? for a total cleaning?

on my &quot;roundtuit&quot; list but would they be that intermittent??

&gt; Injector going bad?....thought about driving around with
&gt; 1 injector wire disconnected at a time for a little while?
&gt; And I forgot one....

BTDT, no this is not like that.

&gt; How about checking ground and mounting tightness of the ECU?

check
&gt;
&gt; And unplugging it and replugging it in case you have any corrosion on the
&gt; contact pins.

Check, and also all the other plugs from AFC to double relay etc etc.

&gt; You might think about connecting a light bulb or something similar
&gt; around the ign switch to the wire that goes back to to the coil....you
&gt; know alligator clips and just look at it when the power loss
&gt; occurs.....just for fun.

??? just for fun eh??? you have a strange sense of fun.  (but might try it
anyway)

&gt; Yes, it would be really nice if you could have someone looking at the fuel
&gt; pressure when it does it.  That's how I finally found out about my gas
&gt; tank crud when I had a similar problem.

yes, haven't had anyone handy of late who would know what to look for..

thanks

bought a MSD high output coil this afternoon. two questions  should I use
the ballast resistor or not?? it says to use it with points but I have
Pertronix.   and the other is if I use the resistor where do I plug in the
othher stuff connected there before or after the resistor??


wheeee

Bob
