Subject: RE: alternative heat source

&gt;Karl corrected me, the optional gas heater for 78 was the BA6. I don't
&gt;suppose anyone has one of these gems, do you?

I have these on a couple of my busses and they are very complicated, to
keep them safe. This means there are many reasons they won't work. Parts
are very expensive and hard to find. When they do work, they work GREAT!!

It seems more people use the older, simpler heaters rather then the BA6.
I'm not sure what year the bay got them but the aircooled Vanagons had them
too. Does anyone know of a substitute for a flameswitch on a BA6? They seem
so simple but I am afraid to just substitute a thermal switch since I
haven't seen one with a long probe like the flameswitch and I don't know
the temp the microswitch operates at. The testing in the BA6 manual just
says to heat it up to check operation. I've seen some thermal switches over
at meci_dot_com that have short probes, don't know how long they would last in
the exhaust stream tho.
