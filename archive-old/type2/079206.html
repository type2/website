Dave,

I am sorry to say that my experience with the copper nuts was not a happy
one.  I found and bought a box of what were labeled &quot;copper exhaust nuts&quot;
and used a bunch of them over time.  These nuts *looked* like they were
copper and had a slit cut in from the side and were crimped to make them
locking.  When I came back to one of those systems a year or so later, the
nuts were quite rusty and not the joy to remove I expected :-(  When I
took a file to one of the nuts I had in the box, they turned out to be
copper *clad* nuts and once the copper burned off, they rusted like
the steel they were.  VW recommends copper nuts and I would say it was a
good idea, but make sure that they are copper thru and thru!

As I said in my previous post, I have had good luck with stainless nuts
and bolts on the exhaust for my '80 Vanagon.   Metric stainless fittings
are not easy to find, but worth the effort!

If I could find them (so far, no luck), I would say the ultimate in
corrosion resistance in the situation we are dealing with would be
silicon-bronze nuts.  Alas, I have not seen thes in metric thread here in
the states :-(((

&gt; I plan to use the hot wax method to get mine off as espoused by Bill May
&gt; over on the vintagevw list.

Say on! Say on!  What is this hot wax method?  If you have a copy handy,
or can convince Mr. May to do it, please post this.  More information is
better :-)
