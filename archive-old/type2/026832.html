do the 68-73 Westys with the rear luggage rack use a seal for the base? my 
71 never had one, i assumed that was so it could drain as the base sticks up 
off the roof....i see in the latest Hot VWs in an ad that a company sell 
seals for the base (rack to roof) in addition to the poptop to rack...for 68 
to 73 (i guess that was when the rack went to the front)...
