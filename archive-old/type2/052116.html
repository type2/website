Subject: Re: [T2] VWoA locally is full of it, IMHO

&gt;Well, when I inherited my '78 Westy, I immediately went to the local VW
&gt;dealer (Houston) to get some replacement parts and was nearly laughed out of
&gt;there.  Not only did they not have any in stock, they were completely
&gt;uninterested in even trying to help me get any parts.

When I first got my '78 Westy, I ordered a set of pushrod tube o-rings, not 
cheap, but reasonable (didn't want to buy crummy aftermarket stuff that 
would be rotted and leaking in 12 months). The price was maybe $15. A week 
later I went to pick them up and was shocked to find the price had jumped 
to around $40. I got mad, and asked them what rare rubber were those made 
of. I didn't yell or make a scene but I left it be known that the price 
gouging was ridiculous. I went across town and bought them from an 
aftermarket supplier for about $10 a set. They lasted a few years until my 
rebuild.


This is the second time I got 'ripped' by a VW dealer - the last was by an 
Italian VW dealer which successfully sold me the clip that holds the timing 
gear on a Type I engine for about $75 - I needed the part for a friend's 
motor, and my friend eagerly paid for the part. I told them the part could 
be had for penies if they'd be patient.

I've had this happen with so many factory parts counters (any brand) that I 
seldom shop any where but the catalogs.

A friend who works for Chrysler admitted they doubled the price of parts 
before they sold them across their counter...

VW should protect their logos, the aftermarket should rid their parts of 
the VW trademarks, and we can get back to fixing and maintaining our old 
VW's. Porsche did this recently with many Porsche websites.

I think VW wouldn't care on bite if the VW aftermarket went belly up and 
the old VW's went away - maybe more of us would buy new VW's? Not me, I 
can't afford a new VW bus one way or another.

What happened to VW? Once the people's car, they now sell cars that compete 
directly with Audi in price - like building two cars (Olds and Buick) and 
neither can successfully capture the same market?

I like the new busses but my house doesn't cost much more than the new 
Westy. I guess I'll keep driving my old '78 with a few updates.
