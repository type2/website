Subject: Re: [T2] Diesel Engine for later type 2?

There are a bunch of people in Germany who run diesel engines in their
buses. Apparently, the preferred engines are the 1.7 Turbo Diesels out of
late Vanagons or 1.9 TDIs both on 5-speed Vanagon trannies. They get good
milage, great torque and provide for cruising speeds around 90 mph with some
potential left for passing.

There is a guy who makes conversion kits which (as far as I know) contain
little more than the engine supports.

If anyone is seriously interested I can try to find out more.

There is a fellow in Michigan that I have seen a
couple of times at alternative energy shows in
Wisconsin (http://www.the-mrea_dot_org/) who was selling conversions using a
diesel Rabbit engine in a bay window bus, using (supposedly) all VW parts.
I had contact info for him, which I posted here a couple of years ago, and I
suppose I might be able to find his business card again if I remembered to
look when I am home. Check out the MREA link if you are interested in solar
or wind energy--it is worth the trip to the fair for many people--I think
that usually almost all of the states are represented plus all the
continents--last year even someone who had last lived in Antartica.
