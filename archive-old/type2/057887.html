&gt; '71 Loaf.  Both books I have (Muir and Clymer) say to pressurize the
&gt; windshield washer fluid to 40 psi at the local gas station's tire
pump.
&gt; However, the cap I have that goes onto the spout where you fill the
fluid
&gt; doesn't have any sort of nozzle to fit a tire air pump... how is this
&gt; done?  Do I put the air pump onto the nozzle where the washer would
spray
&gt; onto the windshield?

There should be a rubber hose coming off of the top of the washer
bottle (pull off the black plastic cover if it's still there) with a
schrader valve on the end.  Pressurize carefully, as the air volume is
small.  I'd put pretty long odds on if the system is still working and
leak-free.  Usually the hoses are cracked or the valve is shot.  Be
prepared to depressurize the tank if you see a drip from behind the
dash.

Common practice is to put an electric pump in-line between the tank
and the nozzles, bypassing the valve in the windshield wiper switch. 
To control the pump, install a pushbutton next to the windshield wiper
switch.  This method is much more positive and troublefree.  VW is
using this method on current production aircooled vehicles.
