First, let me say that it's nice to be back among the living having been off
the list for a month or so during a move to Florida. Next, let me ask a
question:

While replacing my Pertronix (again) with points, I discovered something I
thought was very strange. I set the points, then checked the dwell angle
with a dwell meter. I thought dwell was supposed to remain constant
throughout the rpm range of a given engine, but this time the dwell went up
and down with engine speed. I asked a VW parts guy about it, but he said
&quot;heck, don't mean nuthin. It's just advancing.&quot;

Which makes no sense. If the dwell angle is the measure of how far and for
how long the points remain open, shouldn't it remain constant? If so, why is
my dwell angle going all over the place?
Bob
