&gt; &gt; &gt; What's everyone using as for battery rating (cranking amps) in there Buses?  I
&gt; &gt; &gt; bought one for the 67 Panel that was 450 CCA but seems weak.  I noticed
&gt; &gt; &gt; Wal-Mart sale a Max something with 1000 CCA. Anyone had luck with this?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The smaller size 42 battery will be around 450 CCA. The larger, standard for
&gt; &gt; a bus, size 41 battery will have a much higher rating: 40-50% more typical.
&gt; 
&gt; IIRC, buses up to my '71, and perhaps beyond, were equipped with the same
&gt; battery as bugs, which is logical considering that the engine and starter
&gt; were the same.  It's common to put a group 24 battery in though, as they
&gt; fit fine, are much easier to find (and probably fresher) and have a bit
&gt; more capacity.
&gt; 
&gt; Just about any battery will spin a VW engine just fine.  Group 24s

I have the twin 950CCA batteries in my bus for three major reasons

.  it is an automatic, you don't push start it!
.  I like to ski and use the bus to get there so I have to crank that baby
up early on bitter cold mornings to get to the slopes on time...plenty of
reserve cranking makes me feel much more secure
.  I can't hike out to get help.
