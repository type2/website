Subject: Do you know your horsepower?

Hi all. Here's an interesting formula I ran across
in one of my old hot rod books:

Peak HP =       vehicle weight x (mph)squared
                -----------------------------
                        10,000 x ET

This is exactly as it reads in the book. I would
imagine the ET stands for the time in a quarter mile
since this book is about Chevy small blocks.

Have fun and don't get caught!
