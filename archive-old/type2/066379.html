Subject: Double Cab Snorkel?

Hi All.

I had the great fortune of meeting list member Bill Abbott this weekend. 
He brought his single cab over, and we poked around each other's busses 
and chatted for quite a while.

During the course of our conversation, Bill pointed out a unique feature 
on my '76 double cab. In the right rear corner of the passenger cab (on 
the exterior) is a small vent that goes down into the interior of the 
cab. It then makes a couple of right hand turns through a plastic part, 
and then the passageway goes through one of the frame rails all the way 
back to the engine compartment.

Now, given that this is allegedly a former West German army vehicle, Bill 
and I surmised that it must be a snorkel for the engine while fording 
through a stream.

Anyone have any ideas on this? Ever seen it on other late model double 
cabs? I'd love to find out more information on this.

Curiosly yours,

Bren

From the attic came an unearthly howl. The whole scene had an eerie, 
surreal quality, like when you're on vacation in another city and 
&quot;Jeopardy&quot; comes on at 7 p.m. instead of 7:30.
