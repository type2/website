Subject: Rear hatch (was [T2] RE: Sliding Door)


You know I always wondered about being able to open the rear hatch from
the inside of my van.  There's a hole at the bottom-center on the inside
of the hatch where it looks like a mechanism for such could exist.  Am I
missing some hardware?

Thanks

Fortunately, no such problem exists with the rear hatch, which can be
unlocked 
from inside regardless of the keyed status. Good for me, bad for
transporting 
curious kiddos in my 71 (which has yet to happen).
