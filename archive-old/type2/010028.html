&gt; I'm very certain that the FI being too lean is not the problem.  I've 
&gt; checked it several times with the O2 sensor (at idle) and the engine
has 
&gt; absolutely never run hot.  I've used the &quot;dipstick&quot; test after long 
&gt; freeway runs (though the car is basically an &quot;around town&quot; car) and
the 
&gt; dipstick hasn't even been warm to the touch, let alone hot.

Considering the source of your engine, I'd bet that that valve had a
lot more than 28,000 miles on it when it failed.  If a part is within
wear limits, by any amount, it will go into the engine.  Most VWs are
resold rather often, so it is seldom that the buyer of the &quot;rebuilt&quot;
engine will drive it far enough for it to fail.  You are obviously an
exception.

Your engine life isn't exactly untypical for a GEX rebuild.
