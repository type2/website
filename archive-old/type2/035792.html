Subject: Timing/Pulley

I am checking the timing on my '71 camper van.  1600 DP 
engine,  34PICT 3 Solex carb, vacuum advance dizzy
 (023 117 036).  The pulley has 2 timing marks.  A v-shaped
notch on the front (fif) of the pulley, and at about 5 deg to the
left of that notch is a round indention on the back of the
pulley.  I am guessing that the v-shaped notch is TDC and the
round indention is 5 deg ATDC.  Bently says the '71 should
be timed at 5 deg ATDC.  Does anyone know if my 
assumptions about the notch and indention are correct?  If
I am correct, then my timing is incorrect.  I would think that 
the round indention (5 deg ATDC?) should line up with the
split in the crank case when the timing light fires.  Right now
the v-notch is about 1 inch to the left of the crank case split
when the timing light fires.  Thanks for any help/advice.
