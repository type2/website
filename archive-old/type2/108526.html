&gt;when i decelerate coming to a stop or if im simply
&gt;idling my bus pops, sounds d-tuned or something, i
&gt;have notice it appears to get worse when its hot.
&gt;can someone shoot me a list of probables??
&gt;the carb has been rebuilt, new fuel lines, points,
&gt;wires, but im not sure if its possible that the head
&gt;is warped, PO says it overheated and then it sat for 7
&gt;years, til i tweaked it to run...
from GGM
take a look at your tailpipes, I'll bet they are full of black soot. It sounds like your
carburetor has too large main fuel jets. When you take your foot off the gas pedal upon
deceleration the vehicle spins the engine and you have lots of unburned fuel going into
the exhaust system and burning (exploding) and popping. If you have nice whitish gray
colored tail pipes, then you have the correct fuel mixture, but you probably have an
exhaust manifold leak near the start of the exhaust manifold. Any exhaust manifold leak
is really dangerous because of the use of engine compartment air for the &quot;fresh&quot; air to
run through the exhaust pipe heat exchangers for passenger compartment heating.
