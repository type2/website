&gt; What about a recently rebuilt AC motor makes it get such lousy MPG
&gt; initially?

until it is fully broken in MPG will be lousy, a lot of friction and it is
honing it self to fully seat bearings etc.

I didn't see over 10 at most when my now averaage MPG bus was breaking in,
it slowly over the first 1,000 miles or so got better and better as it
losened itself up
