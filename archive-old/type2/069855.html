Subject: Should I?  major decision time here ('66)

Okay, here goes.  I've been trying to get my '66 Westy started for a
little while to no avail.  I recently removed the gas tank and had it
cleaned and sealed, put on new fuel lines, new plugs and tune up stuff,
brand new 6v battery, I put the engine back in and wired everything up and
I got nothing but a click.  I'm not getting any dash lights and I've been
going through Muir's troubleshooting steps but haven't been able to get
the red and green light to go on or get the starter spinning.  Any ideas
or tips?  Wait.
        I also have a '71 1600dp which I am planning to put in the '66 in
the near future.  I have the 12v starter, regulator, battery, carb, etc.
Basically I just wanted to get the bus started ASAP.  My question is
whether I should just give up on the 6v stuff (I don't want to waste any
money on a new starter or regulator) and put the 1600 in and convert to
12v right now, or should I play with the current set up some more?
        If I use the 12v starter I think I need a bushing or adapter,
right?  What exactly is this and where can I get one?  Oh yeah, I'm just
curious, is a type III transmission useable in the bus?
Thanks in advance,
- -Erik.
