Subject: 1974 Thing for sale

I promised a fellow today that I would post his Thing on the net.  I
am copying this message to the type2 and vanagon lists as Things are
really busses in disguise [there is flame bait...donning asbestos
underwear;)]...or at least I feel that they have more in coming
[metaphysically] with busses than beetles ;)

Since Larry is not connected to the net yet [we are working on it], I
will accept serious responses to this post and relay them to
Larry...however, I strongly encourage anyone interested to call Larry
directly.

Here's the dirt:

Vehicle:        1974 Type-181 [Thing/Safari]
Mileage:        ~38 000 [original]
Notes:          This car is all original [curtains, top, even rear
                brake shoes, exhaust, heat exchanges, etc.].  The top
                is starting to look a little weathered, but no holes,
                the top-frame is straight, and the curtains are good
                [minimal hazing].
Options:        A BN4 gas heater, and rear [swinging] tyre mount are
                available, but not installed. [Note: I tried to buy
                these, but Larry won't sell them to I until after the
                car is sold...if he still has them then]
Price:          $7 500 (cdn) [Negotiable]
                This is approximately $5 500 (USD)

Contact:        Larry Drakker
                Dieppe, New Brunswick
                Canada
                (506) 857-1808 [This is his work number.]
                Call between 09h00 &amp; 18h00 AST [08h00 &amp; 17h00 EST].

                Tell him that you saw Roy's posting on the 'Net!!!


Once again, I will relay serious offers to Larry.

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!

Roy
