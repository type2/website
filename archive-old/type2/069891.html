I

I think you all might be missing something here... 

What happens when you lean out your fuel mixture? Engine run a little hot?
Coasting down hill with your foot off the gas will cause the engine to run lean.
Sure, the throttle plate is mostly closed, but the carb is running on the idle
circuit. My idle jets are less than half the size of my mains. Got your big toe
in the carb? Running up and down hills, constantly giving a little squirt from
the accelerator pump? Probably running a little richer overall than you would on
a flat run. Lots of gasoline in the combustion chamber brings down head temps.

My van *always* runs hotter on long steep decents than it does on the way up. I
try to coast as much as possible, and have even been known to shut the engine
down periodically. Of course, the '72 does have disc brakes   ;-)

My $.02 (Why is it that computer keyboards don't have a cent symbol?)
