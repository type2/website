Subject: '72 Bus for Sale in South Bend, Indiana

Not mine.

Spotted a light Blue and White Bus for sale yesterday on Auten Road
North of South Bend.  Pulled over in the dark for a look.

It's a '72 Passenger bus with a nice roof rack.  Card on the dash says
it has a '79 2.0 in it.  Looked pretty soild, some rust as far as I
could tell in the dark.  Asking $2000.  Ph:  (574) 271-1215

By the way, the world should know I got my &quot;new&quot; '79 Westy Deluxe
running and on the road for the first time last weekend! Injectors
refurbished by Cruisin Performance, Thanks, Rich.  Was as awsome
experience.  Can't wait to camp in it!
