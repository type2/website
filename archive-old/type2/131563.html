Subject: Re: [T2] Bentley on Automatics

That's where I saw mine last night. Let's not confuse the tranny with the 
final drive now. Most FLAPS that I have gone to or talked to call the final 
drive the transfer case. I had the NAPA guy tell me he listed a front wheel 
drive auto tranny for the '77 Bus. But he had the rear wheel drive one too.

'77 Westy Deluxe, &quot;el Verde&quot;





&gt;From: Access Systems right, I personally have never had to buy a gasket or 
&gt;screen for an
&gt;automatic, they are all cleanable

&gt;the plug for the fill of the final drive should be on the same side as the
&gt;shift linkage and slightly above and to the front of where the half shaft
&gt;comes out....
