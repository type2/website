Volks, 

I hate to step in when it is such a popular subject, but we have a real
load problem on the server at present.  Queued messages are over 100 :-( I
know that, like so many of the Friday topics, it is hard to stop when it
gets going good, especially for the digest volk who miss out because they
don't get the digest 'til the next day, but please respect the friday-only
limits.

Sorry to be the Grinch :-(

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
