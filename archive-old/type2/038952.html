Subject: RE:  Camping stool trash can

while on the topic of trash boxes and cans, i have the box, and need the 
can!---- anyone who has one i'd love to have an original one,  and would 
likely pay a foolish amount for one.  i'm sure i'm just dreaming, but if 
anyone has a spare, or one they dont want/need, email me direct---- thanks
