Subject: hesitation upon acceleration

I'm not sure why, but my 79 seems to hesitate when I press on the gas pedal. 
It doesn't happen everytime. It occurs more frequently when going up hill. I 
feel like I loos power for a second. then its like it suddenly kicks in and 
starts having a lot of power. Then it goes back to no power. This happens in 
like a 10 second time period. I have weak power. Then it feels like no power 
for a second and then awesome power for a couple seconds, and then just weak 
power again. Some times it isn't a problem at all, but sometimes all of a 
sudden I can't even make the speedlimit and I get scared I'm gonna break 
down. Thanks for your advice.
