OK Folks,

Other projects are beckoning. and it is time to part ways with the 
faithful 1968 A-wagen. The price is $3750 and the bus is currently 
located in Greensboro, NC.
There are picks as well as a detailed rundown of what the bus is all about at
http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~macbus/

Thanks
Chris
