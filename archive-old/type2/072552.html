Went to Brys today to pick up some engine tin and was sent away due to company &quot;reorganization&quot;.  Everyone there was hesitant to give me any information as to what was going on or when and if they were planning or reopening soon.  For those of you who dont know, Brys is the king of VW junkyards in the Northwest.  Does anyone local have any idea of what is going on?  I surely hope the reign is not over.
