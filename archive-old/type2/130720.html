Subject: Finally figured it out???

Some of you may have seen my posts over the past month or so explaining 
repeated head problems that I have experienced with my  stock '79 2L 
engine for the past few years.  The original engine in the bus lasted 
to 145k miles before dropping a valve seat, so I rebuilt.  To make a 
long story short, following the rebuild (with all cooling tin, engine 
seals, thermostat etc. in place), I was burning valves at approximately 
6000 miles (this happened twice).  So now, I've just reinstalled the 
engine in the bus with brand new AMC heads and stainless valves.  Last 
night I was installing the distributor cap just prior to trying to 
start it up for the first time and noticed what looked like  metal 
filings on the hall pickup (CA emissions engine, electronic ignition).  
I pulled the distributor out for a closer look and noticed a lot of 
filings inside, so I took it apart.  It turns out that one of the 
springs for the mechanical advance had broken, came loose and was 
rattling around inside the distributor creating the metal filings that 
I saw.  From the groove in the wall of the distributor this appeared to 
have been going on for some time.

I have a spare distributor  with the hall ignition that I will install.

So my theory on why I have been burning valves is that I have had too 
much distributor advance coming from the mechanical advance mechanism 
due to the broken spring.  I also feel that this is likely to have 
caused the dropped valve seat in the original 145K mile engine.  When I 
first installed the rebuilt engine a couple years back I had trouble 
retarding the timing enough to achieve the spec 5 degree ATDC (dual 
vacuum hall effect distributor).

Does this seem feasible???
