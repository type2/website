Subject: seals

All, 

In working with my lights the past few weeks it has come very clear to me that I need to replace my housing seals. It could use it all the way around. I've checked BusDepot, they dont seem to carry them. RMMW is the only vendor who I have found carries em, and I've noticed most of their stuff is pretty pricey.  Anyone know of anyplace else? My local FLAPS closed down a few months ago, and boy do I miss them. 

Thanks!
Melissa
