Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Cooler help

www.ahendorp_dot_com

Sells an aluminum adapter to connect hoses to stock cooler hanging under the bus. I use it on my Type IV powered '65 Beetle (relocated oil cooler to make it all fit in the Beetle). I would maintain the stock cooler, and use an oil-stat to keep the secondary cooler out of the loop on cold days. 

FWIW my '78 Westy NEVER had high oil temps even when towing on hot July days. I think you're wasting potential rebuild money. Why not add instruments to see if you really need an oil cooler. 

My opinion is that alot of catalog companies have made alot of money off of oil cooler kits that were unecessary. 

Just make sure the engine is clean and in good condition, all the tin is there and well sealed.

Chris
