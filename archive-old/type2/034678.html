Subject: RE: Heat Exchangers $

&gt; I'm replacing the heater boxes and I'm seeing different prices. What's the
&gt; deal with these $60 ones? What is the difference between these
&gt; and the $100+ ones? I'm thinking $60 = crap?


I have about 12 pair left of brand new N.O.S. German Volkswagen heat
exchangers for $189.95/PAIR. These are FAR superior to _anything_ made
today. Anyone with a '68-71 bus would be well advised to snap a pair up
while you can, even if you put them in storage 'til you need them.  You will
almost certainly never find this quality again.  See the archives for list
members comments on these heat exchangers if you don't believe me. It is
very unlikely that I will see any more of these when they're gone (at least
not pairs; I will have some left side units remaining, since I got more of
them than rights).

Regarding the Danish ones you asked about, yes, the $60 ones are crap; so
thin that you'd might as well just use J-tubes and save your money.  The
$100 ones are much better (although still not nearly as heavy duty as the
original German ones).
