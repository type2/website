    I really hate to put in my .02 here, but one thing I'd like to point out 
is that with this kind of stranger killing, one of the most common places for 
this to happen according to those that specialize is you guessed it, the 
roadside rest stop. It's kind of the K Mart special for your traveling 
psycho. With the number of you that say you use them, I'd say a watchful eye 
is in order. The thing that really raises the bile in my throat, is the loss 
of freedom and innocence that this kind of crap causes us all. The outrage 
that has been demonstrated here, illustrates that at least some segments of 
society have maintained their decency
