&gt;You are mounting your alternator externally to the tin.  In this scenario,

 From an extraordinarily kind listmember who told me it was from a Porsche 
912 (I think).  A rare piece, but if one could solve the coupler issue 
(like I tried to do a few years ago with... partial success, see 
http://www.type2_dot_com/des/vw/bluto/ac/) the factory air pump pulley assembly 
could be used.

&gt;This has me thinking that I could mount an internally regulated Chevy 105
&gt;amp alternator outside like you did.

Chevy alternator??  NOOOOOOOO!!!!  (just kidding).

&gt;  Then,  I could disconnect the belt
&gt;to the factory alt, or, I could have the second alt run my electronics and
&gt;extra battery, etc.

Yes, either solution should be okay.  I am leaving the factory alternator 
as-is.

There are some more pictures of the finished bracket and installation here:

http://motorheads_dot_net/vw

I painted the bracket with self-etching primer and then two coats of 
industrial grey enamel.  It's not particularly good looking, but it is 
strong and works well.  Due to the small drive pulley diameter, the 
alternator does not charge well at idle, but it's not an issue for me.  It 
starts putting out lots of current just off of idle and the engine spends 
most of its time around 3500rpm anyway.  The factory air pump drive pulley 
is even smaller, but even then I  don't think it would be an issue.
