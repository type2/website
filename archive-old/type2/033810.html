Subject: 1969 bus has a new home

Hi,

The story has ended for me. Our '69 bus that had its butt kicked in a rear
end collision has a new home. Wayne from Petersburg, Va. came down with a
trailer today and hauled it home. He made side trip to AirWerks just North
of Greensboro, NC to pick up some bus metal. I wish Wayne the best of luck
putting the bus back on the raod.
