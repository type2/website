Subject: Re: [T2] RE:'78 Deluxe Westy-$16000- Worth it?


&gt; Part of the charm of owning a bus, for me anyway, is the gritty charm of
&gt; taking it on the road. Another charm is the personalization that finds it=
s
&gt; way into a bus during the process of restoration--the homemade curtains, =
the
&gt; panels, sound system, the mechanical tweaks and fixes, etc.
&gt;=20
&gt; ......
&gt;=20
&gt; If it is to own and drive a classic that will not only hold but probably
&gt; increase its value if properly maintained, and you can afford it, then I
&gt; would say go for it. Better that than a Kia or Hyundai.
&gt;=20
&gt; On the other hand, if part of the attraction of owning a bus is to go
&gt; puttering down the road, vent window open, radio on loud enough to be hea=
rd
&gt; over the engine, beer and sodas chilling in the ice box, and a
&gt; devil-may-care independent attitude making life a pleasure and worth livi=
ng,
&gt; then I say welcome to the other club.

Hi John (et al)

Well I've been both sides of the fence.

Firstly I had a rough '73 which over a number of years I restored; enjoying=
 the work and personalisation involved. Then it died big time - the outer p=
art of rear torsion bar tube
became detached from the chassis - and my bus (minus all removable parts) w=
ent to the scrap yard.

Secondly I have my current bus, a 1998 T2 imported into the UK from Brazil =
(not legal for import to N. America) with a 1600 FI aircooled engine fitted=
.

If you buy a bus to use and enjoy then there is no difference between drivi=
ng and using a 150,000 mile 25 year old bus and a 0 miles bus. Yes the new =
64hp 1600 engine is faster than the old 49hp 1600 engine, but the quality o=
f the bodywork and interior has not changed my outlook on life one little b=
it, nor has it changed where I take the bus.

Is a $16000 westy worth it? In the end thats for the buyer to decide.=20

Over the six years I had my '73 it probably cost that much, to buy restore =
and maintain. The current bus (now with 30,000Km -18,000miles - on the cloc=
k) cost less than =A3600 ($1000USA) to maintain last year and that included=
 having a made to measure one off stainless steel exhaust system fitted.

My experience is that you can buy a tired bus and have your hand in your po=
cket all the time, or a pay a lot more up front and be able to enjoy your b=
us with out wondering when it will next need some work on it. Either way I =
suspect that the cost of ownership per year over a ten year period will wor=
k out the same on my new bus as the cost per year for the six years I had t=
he 'old' bus.

You pays your money, and takes your chance.

Good luck
