&gt;Anyone got a easy, fast, shortcut for a ring compressor 
&gt;aside from buying one 
&gt;

I take a strip of metal (once it was an old clockspring, could be just a 
roll of stuff from the hardware store, needs to be at least half an inch 
thick) and vicegrip it to the top stud, wrap it under the piston and 
pull it tight.  Work the jug on.  You may have to use it a few times per 
piston, if it's not wide enough for all the rings at once.  It's 
basically the same as the compressor shown in the RMMW cat and many 
others, only it's slightly less convenient, but i didn't have to wait a 
week for it to be shipped.....  Oh, little flathead screwdrivers help a 
lot, too.
