Hi all:

Wandered into what seems to be a fairly new website for online ordering 
of parts (www.fastpartsonline) and looked up fuel injection stuff for my 
'81 Vanagon.  What surprised me was that they listed 4 &quot;manufacturers&quot; of 
AFM's in addition to Bosch: AutoTune, Beck Arnley, Borg Warner and 
Carter.  Although the parts were not listed as &quot;reman&quot; I assume they have 
to be.  Don't they?????
