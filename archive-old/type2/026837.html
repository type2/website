Dear Eddie.

I encountered similar problems a while ago, when sorting out the 
installation of a 1971 VW 411LE engine (with Bosch D-Jetronic fuel 
injection), into my 1973 VW 1600 Type 2; which I believe is a very similar 
configuration to the 1975~79 VW 18/2000 Type 2 engine (with Bosch L-Jetronic 
fuel injection).

My solution was to slightly enlarge (by about 10mm) the right-hand 
oval-shaped hole, in the bodywork, immediately to the right of the central 
hole and similarly enlarge the hole in the transaxle support bracket. This 
seems to give satisfactory access to the throttle-body linkage, without any 
strain on the cable shroud.

Having access to e-mail and the Internet, only through the local public 
library, I have no means of posting any pictures on a web site.
However, in exchange for a few light-weight second-hand, USA specification 
1972~79 VW Type 2 spares, I will gladly send you copies of my colour 
photographic prints, by airmail.

Do you have manual or automatic transmission? I have surplus to 
requirements, a spare throttle cable for the USA specification, 1975~79 VW 
18/2000 Type 2, with automatic transmission.

Regards.

Your message read:-

&gt;The bus is a '74 that had stock dual carbs. I'm installing a '75 1800cc in
&gt;this bus, FI and all. Everything is complete except for hooking up the
&gt;accelerator cable. Part of the bus's frame blocks the hole where the cable
&gt;would pass through on the '75. The cable on the '74 passes through the
&gt;front tin towards the left side of the tin. The '75 is a bit right to the
&gt;middle, where the throttle valve is. But, theres the frame in the
&gt;way. There are a few holes about 5 cm from where I want to be but it makes
&gt;the cable scrape against the grommet (mucho resistance). If i drill a hole
&gt;on the tin, there is too much of an angle for the throttle to work
&gt;properly. I'm sure this is a somewhat common problem. I have a new cable.
&gt;What can I do? Drill a hole in the frame? (!) Use a hook and pulley
&gt;system? I'd just like to hear how others have dealt with this and how
&gt;well their solutions have worked.
