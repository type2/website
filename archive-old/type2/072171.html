Subject:  9 years, 1 awning [was Re: [T2] Friday fuel]

grant sez...
&gt;I remember how sore I was when it went up to $1.50.  Now I feel good because
&gt;it's down to $1.50.

isn't that the whole point of the excercise?

obligatory bus biz: passed 1000 miles on my 68 formerly rotting, loaded,
and surrounded by garbage. its a strong survivor. comes at the two year
mark of being on the list. big thanks each and all. the heaviest element on
the cyber periodic table is listeronium.

yesterday i found a 78 riviera that met an untimely demise. appears the
front was caved in while parked. nose emblem to the pedistal caved.
steering wheel oblonged. no blood. scored the perfect awning and hardware:
vw picker folks in the boneyard wouldn't let it go easily. the
i-saw-it-firsters were there. dija ever meet them? they make no sense! they
wanna be like you and me. they wanna pick the part, but they deny
themselves. i slipped the awning off and unscrewed the hardware. everyone
in three check out lines became curious with excitement about the score.
the cash taker lemme know straight up awnings sell new for $500. i told 'em
i can't afford a new one; that i'll just take this one in my hand, if i can
just get out in one piece. not finding a price in the computer, the cashman
asked how much was it worth. i don't know how this came out of my mouth but
&quot;$20-30...&quot; - he had to run that by the manager. i got clearance for
thirty, but i asked him to do $25 for sport. and they take credit cards? at
a boneyard? i may have to forget that part happened. i was pretty psykt
given i had only a screwdriver, small vice grips, and no bread. the 2.0l
engine and tranny are there, complete and sitting ducks. the yard wants
$500 and $250. is that customary? what do folks who partake in this
activity pay for junkyard engines?

finally, i usually don't get into this sort of detail, but the interior is
nearly mint. i didn't pop the scissor top, but if the upholtery is any
indication i'm sure its very desirable by a few northwest listers. it is a
riveria - brown and white plaid. there is a fridge, sink, propane tank, 4
fat knobby cooper tires, slider windows, rear lenses all in very good
shape. lemme know off list if your interested and we'll see how i can help
out. i can't store stuff - the renters around back think 1970 germany puked
up on all four sides of the property one night a few months ago. my concern
is with the windshield gone, this rare interior will be dankity come
november. i'm heading out there in an hour to score the driver door
scraper.  - steve
