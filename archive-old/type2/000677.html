OK, so electrical isn't my strong suit.  The engine is back is, tin's on,
battery trays appear to be doing their job.  But... I have one wire that
shook it's &quot;waterproof&quot; tag when I power washed the engine compartment.  I
don't have a clue as to where it hooks up, hoping I can describe it so you
can tell me.  My Bentley manual omits the &quot;North American&quot; model in the
schematic,  and I'm not sharp enough to figure it out from the archives.

It's a light to medium gray wire with an open spade tip on the right side,
comes out of the small bundle of wires (3 total:  a red on white heavy gauge
wire that terminates at the voltage regulator, a black one that goes to the
generator, and my mystery wire) from the plastic electrical box screwed to
the upper, rear ceiling of the engine compartment.  This bundle of 3 is in a
black plastic sheath that stops about 2/3 of the way forward of the engine
hatch.  There's another, much larger bundle, in the same black sheath, from
the same white box, follow much the same route.  Not that one.  The wire is
just long enough to reach the generator, or somewhere on the right side of
the compartment. Is that enough?  Getting close to gassing up!  Thanks for
the help.
