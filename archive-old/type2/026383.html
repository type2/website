	Kevin,
Try your local VW recycler.  I doubt you're going to find a 'NEW' part.

	Eron Crites

Does anyone know where I can find a straight 72-74 alternator pulley? 
I have used up all my resources, even the local alternator/starter
rebuild shop with their pulley catalog could not help me.  I believe
this should be added to the &quot;List of impossible parts to find for a
VW&quot;.  If you can't help me with finding a pulley do you have any
suggestions on how to take the wobble out of a pulley. One other
thought I have is are there better fan belts that are alittle more
forgiving of the wobble?  The fan belt I have worked well until I bent
the pulley a little.  It's not bent alot but now at higher RPM's it
falls off.  For those of you needing to replace your alternator, be
careful not to bend your pulley when removing it from the old
alternator.

Any help would much be appreciated,

Kevin
