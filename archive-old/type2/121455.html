Subject: RE: [T2] Re: type of engine is this?

&gt;Air or liquid cooled, 21 cc is only enough to turn the alternator...

Folks, there was a ton of sarcasm involved in believing that the engine is
actually a 21cc.  I'm sure she should have said 2.1 L or 2100 cc.  I was
also being sarcastic about the water cooled moped.

I still have no info on the history of the bus.
