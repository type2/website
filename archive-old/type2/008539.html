&gt;FWIW.....
&gt;
&gt;Back in the early '80s, when Mt. St. Helens turned Washington and the
&gt;Northwest into an incredible dustbowl/sandblast box, the airborne dust
&gt;and grit was killing engines in minutes.  No typo or hyperbole, &quot;minutes&quot;
&gt;is correct.

 Good post Fred, even if some of our brethen are calling it a 
story you told your wife . . :-)

 A nylon stocking obviously can be stretched or not for a different
degree of air flow . . oiled , it would stop even more . .

 Can be used as a temp fan belt . . a temp cover for a bad CV Boot.

 In our recent Gulf War, wives were being asked to send pantyhose
to our troopies in the Dirt . . . they make an excellent &quot;gun sock&quot;
 . . you can even shoot thru them . . keeps the grit out of the
action . . for all I know they were using them on their vehicles too.

 It wouldn't hurt to have a pair in the emergency kit . .
