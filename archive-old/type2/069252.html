   have learned a lot the last week, though, such as:
        1) there are several differences from early '63 to late '63, ie: 
     brake shoes, kick panels
- - - - - 
the brakes were changed for the 64 model year, beginning august 63.  However,
a bus built sept 63, is a 64 bus.  The wierd bit is that there was a n option
for the 1500 package in 63, including a 1500 motor instead of the standard
40hp, and bigger brakes that take the same shoes as the 64-67 buses.  The
rear spindles are unique, taking bigger drums, but using the 36mm nut. They
are longer, so a bus using the to 63 brakes would need thinks shim washers
behind the nut (personal experience).

The kicks panels changed when the buses got the flip handle to alter heat
from feet to defrost, instead of the bit you kick sideways.  The later ones
have louvered vents for the feet, which require holes in the kick panels.
 This change was done   on April 14, 1964.  Chanssis no.  1 285 211.  During
the 64 model year.


        2) the '63 bus uses a 36mm rear axle nut, not the 46mm that's on my 
     '66.
- -__----_

The nut size was changed chassis # 1 144 282 was the first with the bigger
nut. - end of July 1963


BTW, are people interested in these numbers and dates of changes?   If so, I
will continue to post them to the list at large.  Let me know (not the list,
for the bandwidth's sake)
