&gt;ok guru's, who can answer my next question.  i have the autotranny bus now
&gt;and am still thinking i want to go with a h2o motor.  is this even
&gt;possible,
&gt;
The short and annoying answer is yes anything is possible with enough 
time/money/innovation.  Because you're doing something that really 
wasn't meant for your bus you'd have to become a guru yourself.  Water 
cooled conversions have been done before and the archives are a good 
source for links, pics and such.  Those who have done them are generally 
more than willing to share their knowlege.

&gt; is the tranny too weak 
&gt;
I suppose it would ultimately depend on the power of the motor.  Folks 
who upgrade their hp big time ultimately need a trans to compensate. 
 This is why people put bus trannsmissions in sandrails, add better 
trans mounts and stuff like that

&gt;next ?  can i have FI with an auto tranny?
&gt;  
&gt;
assuming that you're talking about stock FI that was put in later buses 
that's a much more practicle idea.  The bracket for the aircleaner would 
have to be added and the place for the ECU.  There are several FI buses 
with auto transmissions on the road as we speak.

It's seems clear that your itentions are to give your bus more power and 
frankly I couldn't blame you.  Some things I keep in mind are to always 
keep your bus a bus.  When you change so many things it just makes sense 
to buy a different car or a different year.  With the 73 it seems like 
you should be able to just get a decent type four engine, bigger than 
stock, and some pimp'n carbs... it seems fuel infection has it's 
limitations.  I can definately relate to your situation because I got my 
76 with a blown engine but I basically didn't feel good replacing it 
with anything other than FI for fear of not passing emissions and 
whatever else.

good luck.
