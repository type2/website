Hi. Friend of mine just got this in to his shop, and it's too good to 
part out. It's in Raleigh, NC
1971 High-roof camper
$500/negotiable/best offer- needs to go soon...
complete, but sitting for about 4 years
Engine is seized
body is in above average shape, usual floor/rocker rust, but underside is 
fine 
interior is all there, but dirty/dusty, needs some patching up
needs passenger vent window
no title, but can get mechanic's title papers with no trouble
Basically, this is a good bus that really deserves to live. You can pick 
it up for a few hundred bucks, and either fix it yourself, or have them 
fix it (It is about the only shop I would ever recommend. They do great work)
and have a great bus for travelling.
Don't write me, just call Sean at 919-834-2800, and tell him I sent you.
Please save this bus!!!
