Subject: RE: [T2] Jump start blues!

Mike, thanks for your reply.

&gt; RED DOESN'T GO TO NEGATIVE, RED GOES TO PLUS!!!!!!! 
Beat that in your
&gt; head over and over and over!  And then one more
time!

I hear ya man, but unfortunately - in my bus - the
colors are switched.
Red is the ground, and the hot wire is black....  Like
someone else said,
valuable lesson here, always question the PO's work! 
I didn't....

&gt; Don't hook it up the other way unless you want to
FRY everything.  If
&gt; you have any radio's or other devices, those are
prone to FRY too!!  My
&gt; friend fried his amp by hooking it up backwards..
that was a costly
&gt; mistake.

Well, I already did it, that's why I posted in the
first place.  Not
sure what is fried and what isn't, just that my red
light is on.
  
&gt; I'd first hook your battery up the correct way. 
Hook up the wiring
&gt; harness with all the red cables on it (and a big fat
(probably black)
&gt; one that goes to the starter) to the positive(+)
terminal and the other
&gt; braided one that goes to the chassis to negative
(-).

Everything was hooked up properly before I posted, I
was just wondering
if anyone had any ideas on why the red light was on.
 
&gt; put in the new one, and test out the voltage at
different points in the
&gt; car.  Fuse box is probably a good place.  You should
have 12v on your
&gt; meter.  This is with the key off.

This is helpful, will do.  Thanks!

&gt; Then try and see if the car will start.  If it does,
go and test the
&gt; voltage again and it should be running at around
13.7 volts.  If it is,
&gt; your voltage regulator is still working correctly. 
If it's higher, then
&gt; it's not working.  I don't know the reprocussions of
having a bad
&gt; regulator so be careful..

The car starts fine, it just runs w/ the red light on.

&gt; I don't how else you'd check your regulator, but I'm
sure if I missed
&gt; something that someone else will chime in.

One listee replied in pmail w/ a way to repolarize the
generator, which
I'll try if the voltage doesn't check out.  He
suggested this:

&quot;Polarizing the generator is easy. I believe you jump
the D+ to the DF on the
regulator momentarily only. Check with someone else
before you do it.&quot;

Can anyone verify this?

Peace, Milo

PS.  Thanks to everyone else for the replies as well!
