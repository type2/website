Subject: Re: [T2] Towing Jetta for 100 miles

A big factor for towing will be the price, mostly because if it's too
expensive then it's not worth buying this vehicle for spare parts.  I
suppose that renting just the dolly might be good, but if I need the truck
&amp; dolly then it's probably a wee bit expensive and not worth the price of
the car + towing.

Alternatively the best would be to own some good towing gear for all
present and future needs, but I'm not sure if a buy-it-yourself option will
be available or legal??  For this it seems a visit to Canadian Tire and the
local driving bureau will be necessary.

It will be worthwhile to check u-haul for comparative price shopping as
well because maybe it's not as expensive and I'm expecting.

Also, how come Beetle tow bars are available but not similar gear for other
VWs?

Thanks everyone,
Shawn.
