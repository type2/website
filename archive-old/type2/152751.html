Subject: Re: [T2] Brake drums

A quick check/looksee just now shows that although the inside diameter is
the same, the biggest difference is in the outer groove where the backing
plates mate to it (backing plates for 80-91 Vanagon and 71-79 Buses are
differently shaped [not much, but just enough for a difference]).  In
addition, the groove on the outer lip is larger by a few 16ths of an inch on
the Vanagon drum to account for this difference.  Looking at them side by
side, I would speculate that you *could* use Vanagon drums on the Bus, but
not vise-versa due to the design differences stated above.

FWIW, ATE Drums for both models are now being made in Italy, ATE shifting
all of their production from Germany in the past year or so.  There is
another brand, OMC, but I haven't seen these.

&gt; Does anyone know how the a/c Vanagon rear brake drum differs from the
&gt; 71-79 bus?
