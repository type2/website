Subject: Fwd:  wacking the starter motor..?

Hi,
 
&gt; ... he asked if I had a hammer
&gt; in the car of which I had and gave to him.He then went under the
&gt; van and whacked the starter motor , and asked me to start the
&gt; kombi  and to my surprise it started. 
&gt; ...
&gt; At the first chance I had I bought and replaced the brushes and
&gt; cleaned arond the commutator ...

 It's not the starter motor itself that's playing up but the solenoid
that activates it. this is the smaller cylinder attached to the big
motor part. When it gets hot it's sticking and so there's never
any current getting to the actual motor.

 Try cleaning the solenoid, rather than the motor. You may even be
able to replace just the solenoid, depending on which year bus you
have (after the mid-seventies they don't appear to be available 
seperately).

Cheers,
	W.
