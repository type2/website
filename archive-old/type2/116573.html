Subject: Question about fast idle

Backround I have a '79 westy that has 2L hydro lifter engine and the original stock fuel injection system. She starts and runs great and gets real good gas milege. My question is about when she has driven for a while and gotten up to Operating temp. I stop at a stop light the Idle does not kick down to normal she stays reved up to 2800 RPM I can drag the cluch a little and get it down to the normal 900/1000 RPM but she will slowly climb back up to 2800.  she gives me no problems otherwise. Some one sugested it may be a sensor gone bad has anyone had any experince with this symptom and any ideas on what may be causing it.
