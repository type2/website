&gt; Oh yeah, speaking of oil...I know everyone here uses Castrol, Valvoline or

&gt; checking the SAE service on the oil she may find in the supermarket. I was
&gt; in a supermarket the other day, waiting on my wife, and happened upon the
&gt; automotive section. They had a strange brand of oil sitting there at an
&gt; insane cheap price, so I picked up a bottle and turned it over. &quot;Exceeds API
&gt; Service SA.&quot; I think Oil of Olay exceeds API Service SA.

SA is the non detergent spec, i believe. Looks like you found the ND oil
you were looking for.

Now, the volkswagen type 1 was designed for ND oil, wasnt it... So wouldnt
anything exceeding SA be okay?

I dont think they've changed the lubricating properties of oil as they go
to the newer ratings, just the detergent and multiweight additives?  So
wouldnt anything exceeding SA be fine?

thanks,

Steve
