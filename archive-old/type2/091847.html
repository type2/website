 From a surepower instruction sheet  purchased at pepboys.   Bosch 
alternators fall into group three.  Group three requires a special group 
three isolator that has  a fourth terminal  You then have to pull the 
voltage regulator out of the alternatorand do some soldering,  And then 
run another lead from the alternator to the isolator. This is probably 
why VW didnt use them when they put aux batteries in.  they use an 
isolation relay instead. After looking at that work on the voltage 
regulator i went to the RV store and bought a relay and did as VW did. 
The isolator i bought is sitting in a storage bucket for some future 
other use.

&gt; Hola,
&gt; Anyway, they were using a battery isolated made by purepower or 
&gt; surepower, I forget which. I went to find one of these and it mentions 
&gt; something about Bosch alt and needing a specific kind of one. It of 
&gt; course did not say if it was that one or not. Anyone using a battery 
&gt; isolator, and if so, what band/model? From what I found, I think they 
&gt; sell that pure/surepower one at most auto parts stores, so someone here 
&gt; probably has one.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
