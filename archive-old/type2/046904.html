&gt;If you want a brand new air cooled VW bus, well, that will be a bit
&gt;tougher :-(  They still make them in Brasil, and some countries allow you
&gt;to import them but the US does not.
&gt;

The Busses they make in Mexico that still look like Busses are actually
water-cooled.  Before my computer blew up I had an email brochure of the
current Mexican VW offerings.  Now I have seen pictures of the latest
watercooled Bus, and the roof is now squared off.

We have a 1988 Bus at work that came up here to be scrapped out, but has
been in various use for the past 3 years.  I've been trying like crazy to
get the company to sell it to me.  Looks identical except for the small
radiator in between the headlights.  And the inline 4 cylinder in the back.
