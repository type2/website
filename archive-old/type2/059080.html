Subject: Re: Plug Socket, Dist, Points

Hi,

&gt; I wasn't able to get the distributor off my '79 Type II engine..... Does anyone have any tricks on how I can get this thing out of my motor?

 I bought a ring spanner with a ratchet for this
job- slip it over the nut and ratchet away with the
thing moving through about 10degrees- works
a charm! :-)
 
&gt; What I ended up doing was changing the points while the disty was still installed....I couldn't get the condensor off. Is this a big deal?

 Nope- if it's good you don't need to change it.
It's only recommended because they do fail
after a while and are pretty cheap to replace.
 The trick (if you don't want to pull the dizzy) is
to _rotate_ it until you can get to the bits you
need, and then spin it back to set the timing.

&gt; Now to the plugs:... they dropped on to the block (?) and needed to be fished out from underneath the sheet metal shroud that I can barley get two fingers into.

 I did this on a van I was trying to run a compression
test on before buying it (!) Boy was I embarrassed....
 Got them out with long-nosed pliers.

&gt; Now my qyestion is how the hell I'm supposed to get them back in?!... Did I buy the wrong tool?
 You want one of those spark-plug sockets with
a rubber insert to hold the plug. Mine had lost its
elasticity with age. Bought a new one and all is well again.

Cheers,
              W.
