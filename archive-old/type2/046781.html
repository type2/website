I am in the market for a Westfalia camper. I was wondering what the difference is in horsepower, between a 1982 Vanagon aircooled, and a 1989 Vanagon watercooled. Which one has a better reliability record?? Is the 1982 Vanagon engine exactly the same as the 1979 bus engine?? If it is, then isn't the 1979 bus lighter in weight than the 1982 Vanagon?? I need it to be able to go up hills without a problem. Thanks in advance.....
