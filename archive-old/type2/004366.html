Bad, bad scene there.  Of course all fuel lines themself are replaced as a
matter of course but then it goes to hell.  3.5mm vacuum line is easy enough
to get (get the &quot;diesel&quot; line with yellow stripe, costs more but worth it)
but the bigger lines are tough.  The ones down to and up from the bypass
valve are available but not the nice thin wall stuff it was, most better
places will have German fabric covered to fit though, 12 or 14mm ID I don't
recall which.  The elbow down there is available from most aftermarket
suplliers, BD, whoever.  The rubber T on the other side to the brake servo
and up to decel valve is available but real pricey, $17 from the dealer,
aftermarket didn't have it last I checked, may now.  The real big or
countoured lines is where it goes to hell, particularly the C shaped one
&gt;from decel to the intake S hose is NLA and not duplicated.  The big intake S
hose itself is usually getting cracked and is NLA though the fittings in it
that branch to breather and decel valve and bypass valve are, the steel one
is in fact replaced by an upgraded plastic part.  The breather size hose is
very hard to find period and the correct contoured right angled molded piece
is NLA, american replacement stuff can work but a lot of heater hose is not
up to taking hot oil vapor, some is got to hope, although unsightly I've
wondered if a good quality real Tygon (PVC) tubing might not be a good
choice.  The intake runner tubes are of course available ($12 from BD) and
should be replaced as a matter of course and clamped like Vanagons with
crimp clamps or very sturdy wire ties.  Injector seals must be replaced as
well, Bus Depots are nice molded seals similar to stock not cut tube like
some sell.  As to routing, make sketches or whatever but in point of fact
not much confusion the big stuff fits together generally only one obvious
way and the only possible problem is recalling the correct routing and
hookup for the little 3.5mm stuff which varies depending on year.

This is a real pet peeve issue with me, I think it is about time somebody
starts reproing the S tube (I mean they do the admitedly simpler 1600 and
split tubes, but how hard would this one be) and personally I think even
something for the C tube and breather in like a hard correctly bent
thermoplastic with just short jumpers of fabric covered to hook to the
fittings would be sufficient.  It is very hard now days to get a FI Bus to
pull a good 15&quot;+ vacuum reading at idle for all the small leaks from
unavailable parts.
