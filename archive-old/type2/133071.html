Subject: Re: [T2] rear negative camber

Rob,

Look at Bentley again and look under the bus....visualize what would let
the wheel sit at such an angle.

Look at the bushings that hold the trailing arms in place....wonder about 
what kind of shape the wheel bearings are in.

Wonder what kind of condition that the torsion tube bushings are in.

*All* of these things add up.

If you are going to do the job, just do it once and replace *all* of these 
parts at the same time...most are not too expensive....

Don't ask me how I know this!&lt;grin&gt;

BTW, you are correct, your bus doesn't look like it has saggy butt 
syndrome from your picture.

Cheers, dave
