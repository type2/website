Subject: RE: [T2] alternate fuels

&gt; I just have a question, not a problem.
&gt;=20
&gt; For those who don't want to read the story:
&gt; Is it common or even possible to convert a VW engine to run=20
&gt; on alternate
&gt; fuels? A fellow I met yesterday claims his bus (which he=20
&gt; wants to sell) runs
&gt; on water, alchohol and peroxide!!
[story snipped]

Sounds like this guy's been getting to much CO sucked into the
interior of the vehicle, probably due to the tailpipe arrangement you
described (not being in the slip-stream...)

Not a bad deal for a 78 Westy if it's in good shape rust-wise, but I'd
have to tell him to keep his &quot;fuel conversion&quot; doo-hicky.
