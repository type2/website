Subject: Re: [T2] $235 Oil Pump????

I have one of these pumps on my 75. Works well but don't be thinking it's 
going to give you higher pressure than a stock pump in good condition. Also, 
be very aware that these pumps are NOT going to bolt right in without 
modification! I had to machine off some metal from the piece that mates to 
the cam.

Bus-ted minds want to know

&gt; &gt; You can substitute a CB
&gt; &gt; pump for it though. Check out
&gt; &gt; http://cbperformance_dot_com/catalog.asp?ProductID=195
&gt; &gt; 32 dollars, made for the 914/Type 4
&gt;
&gt; It is there.  Anybody used one?
