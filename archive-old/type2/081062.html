Subject: bus runs good, then bad

72 camper, with new AVP 2000 rebuilt. Most miles on it to and from Everybus,
around 200.

My bus runs good for a while, then will start running poorly. The single
Weber progressive starts the bus cold just fine. Idles good and even starts
out good. After a while though I lose most power, as if I'm not getting
enough gas or something. I can drive it, but its sluggish and backfires. It
won't idle when it does this either. I don't know why but the second time
this happened the rpm's flew up as if the choke was on. I stomped the gas
and it ran fine after that.

Steve Dolan checked and set my dwell and timing at Everybus. When we did a
vacum check the needle jumped all around. Choke is hooked to the constant
power side of the coil.

I ran this very same carb for a year before switching the engines and had no
trouble. The only other thing I changed was swapping my 009 dizzy for a new
rebuilt vacum advance/retard unit. Steve also confirmed I had this on
correctly.

Thanks for any insight!!
Everybus pics coming soon...
