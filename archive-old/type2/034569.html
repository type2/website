Subject: odd clutch problem

Details:   70 w/ a new 1600, good used t/o bearing and pressure plate (less
than 10k on both), 2 year old clutch cable.

Symptom:  when cold, or when just starting, the pressure plate is
contacting the flywheel; resulting in forward motion when the starter kicks
in, or a noticeable drag on engine rpms - noise like
'whooompwhooompwhooomp' too.
As the motor and trans warm up, symptom gets better.
Clutch pedal is 'as tight as i want to see a pedal' according to guru (now
outta town).

What gives? I have had the cable-fraying problem before, which resulted in
sloppier pedal play, but never where you had to have the cable tighter than
a banjo.  Any suggestions?

The cable SHOULD be the correct length (VW flaps sold it to me, looke d it
all up and everything) but that's the only thing that occurs to me. What
should the length be?
