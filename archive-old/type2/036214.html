Subject: RE: Brakes

There's an Australian company that make a rear disk brake kit for Kombi's,
they cost about $750AUD from what I remember and run the standard bolt
pattern etc and are a straight swap and include everything you need to do
the job.  The company is called Volks Engineering and they also do adapter
kits for engines.

I've spoken to them several times and it's basically a one man show, but
he's very knowledgable and easy to talk with, we spent 30mins on the phone
discussing engine conversions even though he knew I'd already done mine and
was just after a price on a tough pressure plate.  Anyway... if anyones
interested I'll track the number down again.  I here that with rear disks
the nose of the Bus tends not to dive as much and it makes a huge
difference, I'm planning on puting them on my V8 Bus when the cash becomes
available.

Cheers

&gt;  What about Porsche 944 brakes? 
&gt;  They are popular with the Super Beetle crowd because they are pretty much
a bolt-on upgrade. Due to the similarity in rear axle design at least the
rear discs might be an option for a bus maybe even the front ones.
&gt;  I have been thinking about this myself but have not done any field
research on it yet. I use my camper to tow car trailers (up to 1.6 tons) and
at times the stock brakes seem to be insufficient for that.

thats not a bad idea...the only draw back i can see (at least trying to
visualize the process in my head) would be that you would need to also use
the porsche wheels to bolt up to the 944 rear disc brake assembly.  or does
a pors. wheel fit the late bays?  having rear discs would be a step in the
right direction.
