Subject: Re: Any advice on cleaning Westy curtains?

To redye the curtains try a local arts supply store and see if they
have an aniline dye the color you want. I remember using this type
of dye in a batik class years ago. It is very strong and it dyed
every type of fabric in the class. I think it would work on the 
curtains as well.
