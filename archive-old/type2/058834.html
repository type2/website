Listees:
I am appealing to the collective wisdom of the list for some answers.  Two
days ago I was driving my '79 (2.0L FI)  down the interstate when it died.  No
weird noises, I just simply quit running.   To make a long story short, after
testing everything I could think of, I found that it had zero compression in
all cylinders.... VERY WEIRD says I to myself since just hours before it had
been running great.  I pulled off the valve covers turned it over and NOTHING
moved!  I have pulled the engine, stripped it and removed the oil pump and
sure enough the cam gear is in a million pieces...
Now the questions:
1) What could possibly have caused this? Has anyone ever seen this happen
before?

2)What will be salvagable in the case?  I have less than 50K miles on a very
thorough and very expensive rebuild.( New german P &amp; C's, Mark Stephens heads,
new cam and lifters, bearings, gaskets etc. )   For obvious reasons I want to
save as many parts as possible.  What really stinks is that this engine has
been very well taken care of (oil changes every 1500 miles etc.) and has been
running absolutely great.

3) Can the oil cooler be cleaned and saved?   Its almost new and I hate to buy
another.

Thanks in advance for your advice
don
