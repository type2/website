Subject: RE: [T2] need used fuel sender

&gt; &gt; ok i just spoke to a guy at RMMW &amp; he said the
&gt; &gt; fuel sending unit for the early bays is NLA.

&gt; 211919051  busdepot 69.00 ??
&gt; maybe it is not in stock? its in the online catalog.


It's in stock. But get it while you can. I imported some from Europe,
since they're no longer available here. But we're down to a handful now,
and don't know yet whether we'll get any more when they're gone.
