Subject: how do you attach your plates?
Mime-Version: 1.0

here in Virginia, we need a front license plate.

so, how does everyone attach this damn thing?  i need it mounted to pass 
inspection.

ps...update front and rear suspension complete (minus the new rear wheel 
bearing that are on backorder.)  now to flush the brakes (new master 
cylinder), bleed them and adjust them.

next week...alignment, mounting/balancing of tires, and the 
infamous....STATE INSPECTION!  wish me luck!
