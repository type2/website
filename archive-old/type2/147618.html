Subject: Chicago VW Resources and 77 Seat Upholstry kit questions

Hello, I used to be active on this list (about 97-01) but have been on a
long hiatus. I've just moved to Chicago and have 2 questions:
 1) Does Chicago have local shops that sell parts or work on air cooled VWs.
I am street parking so I need to hook up shop to get some of the work done
professionally.
 2) The 77 seat cover kit (front seats only) that I'm trying to install is
EXTREMELY hard to work with. I honestly can't see how any human being could
get the bottom part to fit (the seat back was a 30 min job, no problem).
Whereas earlier years use wires and hog rings and hooks, the 77 seats use
plastic strips that have to fit into little pockets around the base of the
seat I had no trouble getting the longer strip into the grove (this accounts
for the front and both sides), but I feel like the vinyl is about 1-3 inches
too short to ever fit into the back part. I've tried all sorts of ways to
compress the springs in the seat, but even when they are bottomed out I'm
still a good 1/2 - 1 inch away from the grove. I spoke with a helpful guy at
TMI who wanted me to be sure the vinyl was warm enough before I started. I
did that, but it didn't seem to help much. At this point, unless someone has
a really helpful suggestion I'm resigned to just paying someone to fix this
-- I'm working in my small apartment and have very little free time to
devote to this, and I'm stuck. Is it possible to mail these seats to someone
and have the kit installed? Is there a different kit that is easier to
install? Any suggestions at all?
