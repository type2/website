Subject: Re: [T2] engine in 70 bus?

Hiya Cha,

The original engine in a 1970 Bus was a 1600 (1584 cc) single port.  This was 
in the upright configuration typical of Beetle engines of the day.  In 1970 
the engine would have been from the &quot;B5&quot; series of engines developing 57 hp 
SAE.  If this engine is a &quot;B5&quot; the bosses in the rear of the case will be drilled 
and tapped for the rear engine support (moustache) bar.

As Jamie advises, the bellhousing will have to switched out an earlier model.

Also, do know that you will have a major problem on your hands in the form of 
appropriate cooling tin.  What you now have (Type 4 tin) will not do the job 
on a Type 1 engine.
