Subject: rat in progress (65 )

what do you need to drive a bus?   stop, go, turn, shift

well,   now it has the shift.   i replaced the metal bracket that holds the
front of the shift rod, that the shifter bolts to with 2 13mm bolts.   it
wasn't too bad to replace, and i had a spare.  i had to remove the front
section of the shift rod to get to it.

and the shifting feels good.  as this bus wont stop, i havent taken it on the
road, but i hope all the gears have the fun in functional.

talking about stopping, i got a friend with a good back to wrestle the front
left drum off.  After a few comments about my wimpiness, he realised that it
WAS d*mn stuck  (ha ha).   He said why dont you adjust the stars.  ha ha ha.
  then wiggling and banging didn't work.  what finally got it off was prying
the drum away from the plate with a big screwdriver, holding that tension
with one foot, while putting another big screwdriver through a lug hole or
the brake adjustment hole and pounding it against the brake shoe ledge.
  this is a really good technique.   only took about an hour or a bit more in
all.

Put on the new brake hose and wheel cylinders.  then i found a decent bleeder
valve and some stars that had all the arms, as these were thrashed by our
attempts to adjust them.   i greased them up well before installed them, and
greased the hole in the cylinder where they go.  wish the DPO had done that.
  back on with the shoes, which were good.   the drum was funky, so i decided
to use another, but the inner wheel bearing had shavings in it, so i need to
look for a good one, or head over to the vw shop for a new one.   this brake
job is more of a hassle than i expected.   i hope the rear drums aren't too
difficult.   the nuts were broke loose last week, and I liberally sprinkled
oil (like holy water, as muir suggests) on the spindle where it meets the
drum then, but i added some liquid wrench today.  

one wheel off and one wheel on, diddle diddle dumpling, my son john

 it needs another name now,  the bus looks happier.  it likes to have usable
gears.  As it's not shiftless anymore,  I don't feel like calling it the rat.
  maybe Jubilee.  i'll think about it.
