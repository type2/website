If I was going to do another camping interior (my first and only was 
a hack job) I would find a Vanagon Westi setup and do the following:
Use the sink/stove/fridge unit only.  Install the water tank in the 
base of the sink side.  IMHO (flames expected) the Vanagon Westi 
interior is the best interior layout, but especially the unit 
described. After that I might install a table from the Vanagon Westi  
but not positive.  Leaving out the rear cabinets leaves room for a 
full width bed in back.

&gt; How hard is it going to be to find a complete Westy interior?  If I can't 
&gt; find a Westy interior, I have been toying with the idea of 
&gt; designing/building my own camping setup.  Good idea, bad idea, anyone 
&gt; have any tips?
