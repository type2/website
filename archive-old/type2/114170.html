Wrong.

A 'B' engine was ORIGINALLY a single port head, dual pressure relief 
case 1600cc engine.  This was a one year only engine in Beetles (1970), 
but was used from '68-'70 in Buses.  The carb was a 30PICT-3, and a 
throttle positioner was the only smog device used.  Stick shift cars 
(maybe auto too) used a single diaphram vacuum advance distributor.  
The oil bath air cleaner and 12v generator were still used.

The pressure relief valves have plugs on the bottom of the engine, left 
case half, which take a large straight blade screwdriver to remove.  
The front one (front of car) is near the flywheel, while the rear one 
is almost directly below the oil pressure sender.

Dual port head engines have aluminum castings at the ends of the intake 
manifold.  Single port head engines have all steel intake manifolds.
