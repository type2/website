Subject: Re: [T2] Attitudes

Hiya All,

In going through the reponses to Tim's original post I found it interesting 
that some folks counseled caution, tact and diplomacy on Tim's part in 
dealing with this particular customer.  As though Tim were going to &quot;unvent&quot; 
on this woman.  As I read these responses I began wondering what I might have 
missed in Tim's original post.  So, I went back and gave it another 
read-through.  It struck me the same as the first time I had read it.

Seems to me from the wording and phrasing indicates that Tim is and intends 
to be every bit the gentleman.  But that he is concerned that some folks out 
there will not accept sound advice simply because of the cost factor 
associated with such advice.  Personally I think it commendable that he will 
&quot; point out a few items to check if it dies, like the 3/4&quot; coolant hose for 
the crankcase breather about to pop off the metric fittings. For the giant 
hole in the tin where the A/C compressor was removed, I'll suggest she cut a 
piece of cardboard and buy some duct tape&quot; or that &quot;Whether I mention any of 
this to her will depend upon how she reacts 
to a few basic mechanical facts&quot; which leaves the proceedings of the meeting 
up to the customer.

Am I misreading Tim's post?  Am I misreading other's responses?

Mike
