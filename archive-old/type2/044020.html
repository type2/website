Subject: [T2] RE: Wisconsin to Florida -- oh well, I tried

&gt;1) VDO oil pressure (not temperature, pressure) gauge suddenly goes off 
&gt;the end of the scale. It had been running at 45 pounds highway (60-65 mph)

That is usually caused by the wire from the &quot;g&quot; post on the sending unit 
grounding out.  I'd check electrical connections before anything else.

&gt;engine backfires and dies. Will not restart for love nor money. 
&gt;Backfires through the carb. Spins fine.

Didn't this just happen to Charlie Ford?  Again, check your electricals first.  
Charlie's points broke and that caused the same symptoms you describe.  My coil 
wire popped off and that caused the same symptoms as well.  

That being said, here's an odd posibility:  Check to make sure the big ground 
strap on the transmission has a good connection to the frame.  Sounds weird, 
but has been the culpret in many a strange problem.

Keep us posted...
