Subject: Re: [T2] West Coast Core

&gt; Hello Guys  I just sold a bunch of old stuff to these guys  their check 
 cleared but they are riding around the east coast now buying old motors .flywheels, 
 cranks ,heads, old trannys, etc.  they dont pay very much for this stuff but 
 a lot of it was junk anyway , I would be careful buying from them as they only 
do stuff on e Barf and are out of a suite in  Lancaster Cali.   Later and 
 have fun  mark Dearing
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

They show up at the VW Classic and the OCTO shows here in southern Calif.
I talked to them once....... what they have is worth big bucks..... they had a sign 
out that they buy type IV head cores..... so I asked &quot;How much are you paying?&quot;
They do not buy heads with cracks, they only buy non-cracked ones and they pay $1
each. Yes, that is NOT a typo, that is ONE dollar each. They sell used 3 bolt 914 2.0 
heads for $250 each. I asked what they paid for those cores....  same BUCK!!! 
I was laughing so hard, I could hardly walk away.
