Subject: [T2] How do you test oil temp senders?

So mine is giving really neat readings like 995 or 7000 deg, etc, then drops
to zero. The digital gauge is ok, it's reading fine, I think it is the
messages it's getting from the sender. Anybody know how these senders send a
message? voltage or resistance??? How do I test it?
Thanks,
Courtney
