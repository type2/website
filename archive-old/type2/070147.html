Subject: RE:Motor Swap Inquiry

This swap will work, a 1600 to pancake. I have not done it yet myself,
and am still debating wether to or not.  I have been collecting info on
this question for a time now and have found many opinions from both
sides of the argument.  All in all it seems the main problem is that you
have to devise some sort of tight fitting engine tin or find old
eruopean tin that was made for this.  This is because heat will be used
to cool the engine not hot air.  Besides this an some minor
modifications to wiring and support brace, it can be done.

I am going to make a faq page dedicated to this on my homepage this
week, so if you or anyone has more questions or answers, send them my
way.
