Subject: FS: 70 CA Westy in Kansas City

Hi All,

There is a very nice white 70 Westy pop-top in my neighborhood for sale.
She's the second owner and brought it with her from California (Santa
Barbara).  Looks like a good deal at $2000.  Motor has 42k on a rebuild.
She knew the original owner for quite a while.  Let me know if you're
interested and I'll get you in touch with the seller.  I can check it out
etc. as needed.  No rust that I can see from a casual glance.  8-)
