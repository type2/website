Okay, in the spirit...

As some of you may recall, when I first started into this business I sold
used parts.  I haven't for years, but I still have the last remnants of
'68-79 used parts inventory filling up a shed outside of my house. Frankly
they're doing me no good.  I've been meaning to put them on eBay for the
last 2 years, and just never get around to it.  Not that the stuff is
particularly rare or valuable - no complete gas heaters or Champaigne
Edition clocks or anything like that - but then again at eBay prices
anything is worth twice what you think it is. :-)

Anyway, if anyone were inclined to rummage through it, they can pretty much
have whatever's there. I have no idea what's left; I think it's been a year
since I even set foot in there.  A couple of seats, some doors, some glass,
seatbelts, misc trim parts, maybe a bumper or two, who knows. Not a windfall
by any means, but probably a few half decent items.  The only thing I'd want
a little money for are the Westfalia interior stuff, and maybe a few of the
Vanagon bits.  The rest is free.  In fact you'd be doing me a favor taking
it off my hands and using it, rather than letting it fossilize in my shed
never to see a bus again.

Please do NOT email me specific requests, as I do not have time to look
through the stuff to see what's there, or ship it for that matter.  But if
you happen to live nearby, or find yourself nearby, shoot me an email first
and you can dig through it yourself and take whatever you want.
