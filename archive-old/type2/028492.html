You can install valve seats yourself with a refrigerator and an oven.  Cool
the seats, heat the heads.  Actually I think the procedure is done with
liquid nitrogen on the seats (contraction) during production.  Once the
temperatures equalize the press fit is quite permanent on properly fitted
parts.  If your cylinder heads run under 300 degrees after warm up, your
motor's not running ;-)

&gt; 'cause the head temps get a damn sight higher then oil temps...if your oil
&gt; hits 400 degrees, it is very very very far beyond being useful in your
&gt; engine...

If your heads hit 400 degrees you have a whole 'nother set of problems; they
heat the valve seats to 350 degrees before they press them in, so 350 should
be enough to help your engine start to press them back out.
