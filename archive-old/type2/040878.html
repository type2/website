Me too.  With a type 1 engine, you can probably get away with buying one of
the small scissor jacks that are usually around $20 at the auto parts
stores.  These also have the advantage that they are small and light, and
therefore can reasonably be carried in your bus at all times.  One of these
jacks and two 2x10x36&quot; boards allowed Nikki and I to get our busses out of
the sand trap from hell in the Mojave desert last year.

I have tried the bottle jacks and don't really care for them, although if I
had had one of the larger ones I might have liked it better.  The main
problem was that it didn't have the lift range necessary to get a wheel off
of the ground.  I had to carry a jackstand and jack the wheel up in stages.
I carry one of the small scissor jacks in the bus with the 2x10 boards to
place under it to take up the slack, and keep a large scissor jack in the
garage for pulling the engine/tranny.

Summary of jacks (in my opinion of course):

Bottle jacks
   Advantages - very small, inexpensive, light, can unscrew the top to take
up slack
   Disadvantages - not much lifting range, tip over easily
   Bus application - Use only if storage space is critical

Small hydraulic scissor jack
   Advantages - relatively small, inexpensive, light.  More range than bottle
   Disadvantages - may have to carry boards to put underneath.
   Bus application - carry under rear seat at all times

Large hydraulic scissor jack
   Advantages - can jack up a wheel in ten seconds, can pull a typeIV engine
                and tranny with it.
   Disadvantages - too large to carry all the time, expensive ($60+).
   Bus application - keep in garage for home repairs.
