Subject: cape cod junkyard

Hi all. I am planning a trip to Cape Cod tomorrow (the wife wants to
shop the outlet stores) I remember a post not too long ago about there
being an air cooled junkyard in Hyannis. I tried the archives but came
up empty. If you have the info on the location or phone number could you
please p-mail me.

Thanks
Jeff and his 70 westy as yet un-named.
