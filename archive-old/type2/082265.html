Hello All  Good to see everybody at EB _at_))_at_ this year what a great collection 
of buses.  On this subject I have seen where you might have to polrize the 
reg. after hooking up the battery wrong. not hard too do just cross the Df 
and D termnals just for a second. I have seen many a bug come in with the 
battery hooked up wrong and the only thing it messed with were thw signals. 
It will also destroy the radio diodes . Later and have fun  Mark Deraing
