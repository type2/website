Subject: Re: [T2] Sewing -

I'm a sort of sewing pro as the musical insrument support I make
involves sewing naugahyde (vinyl cloth) and nylob webbing and velcro.

Re curtain making- cut straight and you'll sew straight!  Iron out all
folds first. I use a board to lay on the fabric and draw cut lines or
hem lines with pencil.
Multiple layers can be pinned, but I like iron on hem tape (acts like a
glue), so you don't get bunches at the end.  If fold/hemming, iron all
the folds- do the far fold first, then tuck in the edge and iron again. 
To sew a straight line, place a piece of masking tape or a marker line
out from the needle that your material edge will follow.  For snaps, use
a sharp nail to poke a hole for the center post- if naugahyde or nylon,
heat the nail in a torch to burn in a hole.

&gt; OK---Here's the solution to sewing a straight line---even on an ole
&gt; treadle machine---
&gt; 
&gt; Go to a store, or singer sewing center, and they have a magnetic plate
&gt; that you can lay along side the foot of the machine, and when you run
&gt; the material through the machine--it keeps it straight going into the
&gt; needle---works good--I used one of these to make my Wal-Mart orange
&gt; curtains---
