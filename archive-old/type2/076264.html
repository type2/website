Subject: Re: [T2] Which meter to buy

Sean,

This is gonna sound funny, but... for auto work I prefer an old analog
radio sha** multimeter.  It was not more than about $12 and does all
things electrical.  I also have used digital and have a very expensive
digital meter...I hate it except that it talks to my pc.

You do need one with a fairly large face(all the better to read with).

You want one with the largest face and highest &quot;ohms/volt&quot; rating.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Well I want to buy a meter (Ohm/ammeter ?) to help troubleshoot problems I
&gt; might have with FI, wiring, instruments, AFM, ECU. Does anyone have any
&gt; preferences/suggestions on which one to get? Please explain why you prefer
&gt; it (sorry, I want the reason why you like it too). This will be for my 1980
&gt; Westy primarily.

&gt; I was looking at some nice units at a new Checker Auto Parts just down the
