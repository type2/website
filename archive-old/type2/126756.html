Subject: Gasoline coming out of tailpipe

I have a problem that I am about at my wits end on.  I have a 1971 bus  with 
a 1600 cc upright engine.  About a month ago I started noticing that  the bus 
seemed to &quot;stumble&quot; while accelerating so I thought either the  accelerator 
pump might have gone bad or the timing was off.  Checked the  timing and noticed 
that it was just to the left of the split in the case  however when I moved 
the carburetor to get the pulley notch to line up with  the case, the engine 
would die so I went back to the original setting.   Bought a kit to rebuild the 
carburetor and when I put it back on the intake and  crank the car, gasoline 
started pouring out of my tailpipe.   Couldn't  figure out how in the world 
this could be happening so I thought maybe I had  done something wrong with the 
carb. rebuild.  Bought a new carb. and  installed it yesterday.  When I first 
crank it up the engine ran really  smooth but within 30 secs. gasoline was 
coming out of tailpipe again and engine  started to run rough due to all of the 
fuel.
 
I have checked the following:
 
1.  timing
2. adjusted valves
3. compression
4. new plugs
5. distributor was replaced about 3 months ago with centrifugal type.
 
Has anyone ever seen this type of problem??  
 
Phil
