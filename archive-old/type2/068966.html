While eating dinner and drowning my sorrows, a truly evil thought came
to mind.  Does this sound anything like simply running out of fuel?
Yeah, it sounds like a silly question.  The gauge reads a little above
the red reserve mark.  If, however, one of the guage's failure modes
is to read high, then that would explain the problem.  It kind of
acted like a seriously fouled fuel filter preventing the carburetor
float tank from filling.  Of course, this guy doesn't have one of
those....

Hoping for a stupid, but easy&amp;cheap solution.
