Saw this on the side of the road today (on the lawn of $250,000+ house)
don't ask me any more cuz I don't have anymore info. 

Churchville Maryland (NE near Aberdeen, right off I-95)
1970 window van.
6 Cyl Corvair engine (claim 110hp)
ser # 2202170125

not a lot of rust BUT it has just gotten a cheap paint job, so who know
what it covers,  white over baby blue, yuck.
  it all seems to be there, bumpers are in the back, middle
seat no rear seat, couldn't see the odometer, no radio, seems to be some
parts on the rear but covered, slight dent in right rear, dash is
pristine, drivers seat well worn, others not bad

the Corvair installation seems to be very professionally done, however
based only on observation it hasn't been run much lately.

No one home so I did not get in or even find out how much they want for
it.

but if you are interested call them at (410) 939-9470

That is all I know

Bob
