I tried to read it carefully but may have missed something (there was a
lot there. I've been incredibly pissed off at a bus, I understand how
that happens =^ ).

It does not follow from the fact your oil light is coming on, that
you're losing pressure. Replace the sensor, those are cheap. Then see.

It does not follow from the fact you're losing pressure (if you are)
that you're losing it because the oil is hot. At highway speeds you
should not lose all pressure due to heat no matter HOW hot the oil
gets, at least until it vaporizes, which is not too likely.

If you're losing pressure at highway speeds, you have a blockage or an
oil pump problem, or a stuck relief valve possibly? I dunno. Time for a
real oil pressure read I think.

Who in the bloody f^H^H^H er, survey sez, you can't fix this with a deep
sump.

A 1600 that has been well and truly overheated, by a true destructoid
such as me getting stuff caught in the fan, will make itself known. It
is underpowered, it makes the Devil's own noise clattering and clanking,
and when you open the deck lid the gas line is boiling and the heat
swirls out in this really tangible way. Is it like that?
