&gt; Ah yes! I have them as well.  Granted, I am only a year into VWs, but from

&gt; Thermodynamic efficiency here people!  But anyhow, yeah plug them all.  

here is the funny thing. By injecting spent exhaust gas (i.e. gases
that will not burn) the combustion chamber actually gets cooler.
Reason is there is less oxygen in there to burn. I know, I know. it
sounds weird. 

&gt; Since you obviously dont have the EGR / Air Pump system anymore, as I dont, 
&gt; those things are no good to you except a new place to let out exahust.  And 
&gt; since you already figured that one out, Id say just plug them and let your 
&gt; muffler take care of the exhaust, thats what you pay it to do.

yes plug all those little buggers, intake &amp; exhaust leaks are bad.
