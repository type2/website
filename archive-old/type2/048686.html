&gt; Rick,
&gt;    I had the same thought, to put lights on my bus.  My plan is to move the 
&gt; spare tire off the nose and cut a piece of 3/4 plywood to go in it's place 
&gt; on the nose mount.  I'll cut the wood to a circular shape, paint it white, 
&gt; and then mount an artifical wreath with lights to the wood.  To power the 
&gt; lights I was going to get a low wattage inverter which would get wired to 
&gt; the battery through a relay which is energized by the headlight switch.
&gt;    Is it legal? I don't know, I guess I'll find out soon enough.

Cops sometimes don't show much christmas spirit if you display red lights
to the front or white lights to the rear.  They don't like blue lights at
all, and green is somewhat iffy.  Flashing lights are also somewhat
suspect.
