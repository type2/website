&gt; I assume this is just in CA? Do you know if it 
&gt;also applies if a later model engine was retrofitted, one that 
&gt;originally came w/ these devices installed? 

Hello, fellow VW fans,

I am currently going through this with a '74 bus I am trying to get up to
California smog standards.  I was told by the 'smog referee' at the state
office that if I could find a '78-'79 engine, the bus would then need the
smog gear for that particular year.  However, I was also told that I could
NOT put an older engine in and use the smog gear for that engine.

PS: Is the Bob Hoover I keep reading about the same Bob Hoover I remember
watching as a kid up at the EAA Flyin, doing spectacular aerobatics in
various planes?
