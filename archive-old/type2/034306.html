Subject: dripping carb revisited

Bad float valve. Valve in Interamerican carb kit (busdepot : Ron isnt 
there a better alternative?) wasnt worth its brass.
I dug up the oldest cruddiest Solex stamped valve and stuck it in and is
fixed. Also replaced the bad section of accel tube that I had to cut out
with 24&quot; of 1/4&quot; american fuel hose and it seems to work fine (woohoo).
