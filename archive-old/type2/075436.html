Dan,

High fuel pressure on the exit end!

Having recently done this, I know that you end up wiggling the fuel pump
around some.  I would probably replace the rubber line from the fuel pump
to the metal line....it may be getting &quot;weak&quot; and leaking.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Greetings List,
&gt; I replaced the fuel filter and it runs fine (for now). Only now fuel drips from the fuel pump (exit end). I thought I had, in my wiggling of the fuel line to get the filter off, loosened the line coming out of the pump, so I tightened that. It still leaks. So my question is this: Is my fuel pump shot or is there a cheaper answer to this problem?
&gt; Thanx in advance
