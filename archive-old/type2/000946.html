If you don't already have them, I would hunt down a doghouse fan and oil
cooler to match.  A full flow oil filter (since the block is already
assembled, you may want to use the CB Performance oil pump with both the in
and out on the cover, but Berg says you can drill the block by using
compressed air to blow out the chips as you drill and tap it, which allows
you to use other covers).  I use a deep sump, but it reduces ground
clearance and I don't think it makes the engine run much cooler. External
oil coolers are controversial.  I don't use one, and don't feel a need for
one. And gauges.  Cylinder head temp for sure, and oil temp and pressure
couldn't hurt.  Other than that, have fun!
&gt;
&gt;I will soon be replacing my 1600 dual port engine with a brand new
longblock
&gt;from Bus Depot for my 70 Camper. I should consider doing to the
&gt;bus as well while putting in the new engine, such as a new oil cooler, etc
&gt;etc. etc. I plan to take the bus on an extended cross-country trip in about
&gt;12 months and want the girl to be as ready as possible. Thanks in advance
&gt;for any suggestions....
