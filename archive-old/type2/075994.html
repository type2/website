Subject: Re: [T2] solid/hydraulic swap?

OEM components are not any different. each cam and lifter set matches to
it's self during break in. I have had more cam failures when using OEM
components than any other (bought directly from the dealer) These days OEM
genuine parts means nothing. The old cams and lifters have no problems if
they stay together as a set..

If you build enough engines you will have a cam failure. We use the WEB CAM
products in some engines with close to 300 PSI of spring tension on some
engines for race apps, they live with that. The stock spring tension barely
will control the valves at 5,600 RPM, it is so light.
 We build over 85 engines in a 13 month period.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Before I started this as a profession I played for years, I can honestly
say
&gt; &gt; that I have built good engine from junk, old parts. For years I never
had
&gt; &gt; cam problems, mismatched lifters and etc were just fine, then all of a
&gt; &gt; sudden it all changed. for 13 months straight we were absolutely plagued
&gt; &gt; with cam failures, from every suplier except web cam.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Try the swap, drive for 100 miles and remove the oil filter, cut it open
and
&gt; &gt; see what you find.if it is magnetic particles, then hold on you are in
for a
&gt; &gt; ride!
&gt;
&gt; My mistake, I guess I never understood YOUR problem.
&gt;
&gt; Your whole 'mismatched hardness' opinion is based on aftermarket CRAP you
buy.
&gt; You put together how many engines in a 13 month period that would not last
more
&gt; than 100 miles using 'mismatched hardness' aftermarket parts?
&gt; I put together 2 engines over 6 years ago that have a combined mileage on
them
&gt; of over 175,000 miles using Original Equipment good used parts that have
matched
&gt; hardness....
&gt; And then you say I must have LUCK??
&gt;
&gt; End of discussion.
