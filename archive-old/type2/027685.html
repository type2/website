Subject: Luggage Rack

Hi All,

I am thinking of removing the rear luggage rack on my 70 westy. I need to
re-attach some of the metal bars and clean them up. I notice that the rear
of the pop top does not seem to come as far back onto the luggage rack as it
seems it should. This may be why the rear latch, inside, does not really
hold the top tight. How is this luggage rack attached to the roof ? Is it
the obvious fasteners that I can see. Will there be any room for adjustment
when I put it back on to get the two tops to line up better?

Any and all help / opinions welcome.

Jeff

P.S. Had a great time at Busses by the Buoy. I may post a trip report
tomorrow.
