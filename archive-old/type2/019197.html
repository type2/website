&gt; I had this problem in my bus too. POINT GAP and TIMING was my solution. 

Rebuilt Dizzy with points meticullously set to 0.016&quot;.  I have a dwell
meter that seems to be on the fritz.  It's only measuring ~10 degrees of
dwell, but the &quot;green&quot;(marked O.K.) ends at 12 degrees.  Timing is dead
on at 5 degrees ATDC with dual vacuum advance dizzy.

&gt;also
&gt; make sure you didn't leave the FI wires disconnected on the left side
&gt; (doh!).

Pretty sure that's not my problem, or maybe it is.
