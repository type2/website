Subject: Petronix testing

Hi all, renoir here.

I have had a Petronix breakerless system for two  years with no problems.
Could this just go out for no reason?
I hear an electronic click, when I rotate the  engine by hand with the 
ignition on but no spark  at the
plug.

How can I test the module?

thank you.
