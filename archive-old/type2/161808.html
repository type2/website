 Today I took mine to a tire shop that I've been using for several  years.
 They installed two tie rods, mounted and balanced my two  new BD Hancooks,
and 
 aligned the front end for $100!  I was going  to do the tie rods but when I
 got under there I found that the cotter  pins were so rusted-on that I was
 going to have to use a torch to get  them off.
   
   The shop got a new alignment machine that had my specs in it.   When I
 showed the guy the Bentley and Richards last couple of posts on  aligning
the 
 steering wheel, he said he didn't need it and knew how to  do it.  I told
him 
 about the camber adjustment.  He brushed  it off.   I went across the
street 
 to eat.  When I got  back he was still trying to get the tie rods off.  Now
using an  air hammer!  I didn't say a word, just left to visit my buddies
 down the street at Lockhart's VW.  I just left the Bentley in the  bus.
When 
 I got back an hour later they had me ready to go.   The boss said the guy
had 
 been cussing me out for an hour.  But  when I saw him he said that I was
right 
 but that he finally figured out  how to set it.  I took it and drove it, no
 problems.  No  pulling either direction and the ride is great, though the
 tires have  much more grip than my old ones.  And the steering wheel is
 centered.  Then I noticed the greasy finger marks on my Bentley  and the
  two articles!
   
   So great advice, guys.  Thanks...KR
