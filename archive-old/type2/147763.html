Subject: Re: [T2] FI or carb

My last type IV bus motor had a single Weber progressive setup. After
driving it for two years, I was determined my next bus would have
stock fuel injection, and it does. I am much, much happier with the
overall setup, and here's why.

First off, the type IV layout requires long intake runners to
accommodate a central single carb. That means that if you want to do
any cold or damp-weather driving, it'll take *forever* for the mixture
to warm up and for the motor to run right. And, again because of
intake runner length, you'll have a helluva time getting the
idle/mixture set up any time the temperature changes. And no matter
what the climate's like, as a rule, you're going to be too rich at
idle and too lean at highway speeds. I was constantly jacking with
that Weber, and I also had to bump the timing up to get any sort of
decent throttle response (a prime recipe for burning a valve or two!).
At peak running ability, the bus would run well on the highway but was
always balky around town. I averaged between 12-15mpg.

You might have better luck with dual carbs, but keep in mind that a
'77 type IV was *designed* to run FI, and the cam and valve
configuration reflect that. Plus, dual carbs mean jacking with
synchronization, leaky throttle shafts, float problems etc. There's a
*reason* nobody makes carbed vehicles anymore!

Also, if you really look at it, the AFC FI system is pretty daggummed
simple. A few sensors, the injectors and related plumbing and the
brainbox, and that's about it. The FI system on my '79 has been stone
reliable; the bus starts instantaneously in hot or cold weather, idles
like it should, runs very smoothly and is returning 20-23 mpg on 87
octane. Don't just take my word for it, but I'd look long and hard at
the pros and cons before I gave up on a gimpy FI system. Make it work!
Good luck-
