Subject: Re: [T2] Re: I have had enough!

Had a Briggs and Stratton powered lawnmower do the same thing a week ago. 
Same problem, same solution. Typical gasoline engine problem.

&gt;Craig,
&gt;   Not long after we bought our 71 bus I had a similar problem
&gt;&quot;.....sputter, spit and backfire under acceleration.....&quot;
&gt;It turned out that the outlet filter screwed into the bottom of the gas 
&gt;tank was clogged.   Pull and replace that filter, flush the tank, and 
&gt;replace the regular gas filter.  That's what fixed the problem for me.
