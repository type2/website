Subject: Re: [T2] New VW...On the road

Rustin,
Congrats on the new purchase!  I hope the bus brings you years of enjoyment
and a better understanding of german engineering!

I would suggest signing up on the AIRS list, invaluable resource on road
trips.  A link can be found on the type2 website.

Good luck,
