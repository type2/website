Subject: e-mail address

I met a couple this weekend at the Mid-South VW show in Memphis, TN that
gave me their e-mail address so I could check on a few bus parts.  Their
last name is Redden, I think, and they are from Kentucky.  Can anyone help
me on this,  he usually buys buses and just takes the engine, cv's etc, to
use on dunebuggys.... The e-mail they gave me will not go through.. would
appreciate any help.
Thanks,
Gail Doles

PS.... the show was great... met a lot of nice people, and saw many great
rides..... one bus was even there from Canada.
