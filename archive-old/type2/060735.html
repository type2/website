Subject: stranded woes are over

Well, the lovely listees saved my bacon again.  I think poor gretel
may have been the victim of sabotage at the gym! THREE hoses were disconnected
(and one of them was not 'very' easy to get back in, how could that thing have
worked loose?) and both the rear clips to the oil filter were undone!

Got everything plugged in correctly and she started up like a kitten.

Now I just gotta fix those valve cover seals and fix the heater and I'm set!

Thanks a ton for your assistance, you guys are the greatest!
