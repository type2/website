    Help, please,,,,,,,
This morning I went out to start her/him up, to no avail.
I tried to crank it over &amp; wound up once or twice then ALL power went out.
Dome light, Radio, etc,,, I got my trusty digital meter out, the battery
seems fine, power going to the starter. Every so often Either I wiggle
something or about every 3/5 minutes the radio &amp; dome light go back on, I
try to crank it again, they go back out. &amp; no turn of the starter. Could it
be the starter???
I dont remember which ones of the bolts I cross to bypass the regulator, &amp;
dont want to fry it trying to remember. ( you know the ones, A wrench across
the two leads produces Sparks &amp; the startter tries to crank!?!) Any-How all
suggestions are appreciated, I called in to work to get it right today, The
apartments I live in are going to pave the section its parked in tommorow,
so Any and All vehicles Will be towed, Just to make it more exciting. So I
need this done like TODAY.
        77 VW Transporter, Automatic, With disabled AC.

PLUS, I am moving in the end of June, SO I have already sold it for $600.00
to a friend &amp; Im sure they would like the thing to be running.

    Albuquerque, NM. is a Mecca for busses, I cant go to work (about a 5
mile trip) w/o seeing two or more busses a day. Different bus a day. Man
that is GREAT!!!

    Thanks for listening to me babble, It seems the www.type2_dot_com page is
down for now. So I have to come here to bug (get-it? bug!) yall _at_ least one
last time, Thanks in advance, &amp; thank you Digest for ALL the help these past
few years!!!!!!!

                Bernie
