Subject: Re: [T2] rebuilt 2.0 oil leak

A random Hoover's writeup:

Oil Seals
Kid comes in the shop wringing his hands, all upset. He's just paid a
lot of money for someone to rebuild the engine in his bug and it's
leaking oil from the front seal. The guy who screwed it up sez it's
not his fault, it must be coming from the rear tranny seal, wants to
sell the kid a rebuilt tranny. And besides, all VW's drip oil; no big
deal. But the kid is sure it's leaking more than it did before it was
overhauled and he's never had his tranny leak and the leaky stuff
doesn't have that thick sulphury smell like tranny lube and his mom is
all upset about the gunk on the driveway. (That last is the real
reason he's here.)

So you drop the engine, pull the old seal, check the end-play ('way
off), clean the oil drain drilling, put in a new shim stack and a new
oil seal. To further the kid's education you show him how the seal has
been ruined; whoever installed it used a hammer.

Hammer = Drips

At least half the drippy oil seals I see are caused by improper
installation of the seal, or by improper engine assembly.

The #1 main bearing oil seal is neoprene or silicone rubber bonded to
a metal ring with a circular coiled spring inside to maintain a
leak-free sliding fit around the center boss of the flywheel. The oil
seal fits into a recess cast into the crankcase; it's a tight fit.
Properly installed, the oil seal ends up slightly below the level of
the casting. Volkswagen shows the seal being pressed into place using
a screw-type fixture, but a skilled mechanic can install one using
repeated light taps from a plastic mallet. An unskilled mechanic will
try to do it with a hammer and while it might look okay, about half
the time the hammer blows cut the silicone rubber where it's molded
over the invisible metal ring inside of the oil seal. Oil quickly
discovers the cuts and you've got a leaker on your hands.

Too Much Sealant = Drips

The improper assembly problem is more subtle but when combined with an
improperly installed oil seal the thing doesn't just leak, it gushes.

Like all of the main bearings, #1 is generously supplied with
pressured oil form the main oil gallery. In normal operation the oil
lubricates the journal and escapes from both sides of the bearing. On
the flywheel-side of the bearing the oil collects between the bearing
and oil seal, flowing back to the sump via a drilling in the left half
of the crankcase. Want to guess what happens if that drilling gets
blocked? (Be careful, it's a trick question.)

If the #1 main bearing oil return is blocked, oil pressure will build
up behind the seal and the thing will eventually leak. That's the
obvious answer. But a blocked oil return port also results in
accelerated wear since the thrust face of the bearing and the
associated shim stack is not being provided with a circulating supply
of oil.

Most often, the oil return passage is blocked by an over zealous
application of sealant when the crankcase halves are joined. Here's
how it happens: The left half of the crankcase is in the fixture,
parting line up, the guy swabs on about four times more sealant than
needed and when he drops the right half of the crankcase into place it
squeezes the sealant out, which flows downhill into the oil return
passage from the #1 main bearing. And that's just on the inside.
Outside, the sealant is oozing all over, including down into the
recess for the oil seal. Being in the 'corner' of the recess, the oil
return passage gets more than its share when it shouldn't have gotten
any at all. (Hint: After closing the crankcase for the last time,
check the oil return drilling to insure it is clear.)

In several cases I've seen engines with sealant deliberately painted
into the oil seal seat, apparently hoping to stave off chronic leaks.
In those cases the oil seal itself was always damaged by hammer blows.
Think about that for a minute. The guy builds an engine, hammers in
the oil seal and sure enough, the puppy leaks like a sieve. So the
next time he globs on a lot of sealant, HAMMERS IN another oil seal
and this time it leaks even worse, convincing him it's impossible to
keep a VW engine from leaking. (And besides, everyone sez VW's leak.
Conventional Wisdom wins again.)

So why do people install oil seals with a hammer? First, because they
see a real mechanic do it successfully and never understand that it
takes considerable skill to do it right. Secondly, they do it because
most of the manuals say it's okay to hammer it in. (And besides, what
could be more basic than a hammer. Everyone knows how to hammer,
there's really no skill involved. Or is there?)

Push or Pull = No Drips

Oil seals are designed to be pressed or pulled into their seats. It's
possible for a skilled mechanic to install them with a plastic mallet,
or even a hammer in the case of some axle seals, but it's also
possible for a skilled surgeon to do an appendectomy with a
pocket-knife; the emphasis is on the skill, not the tool.

Oil seals aren't expensive and they don't look very sophisticated but
there's more to them than meets the eye. If you toss an old one on the
barby and wait for a while you'll be able to examine what's under the
rubber. You'll see that most of them start out as a segmented ring of
thin SHARP steel. Cover that with rubber, tap on it with a hammer and
it cuts the rubber as neatly as a knife.

So press them in. Or pull them. You can make a dandy puller- pressor
for your front brake drums (the seals you'll replace most often) using
nothing more than a length of all-thread, some washers and three nuts.
You can buy a screw-type pressor for the #1 main bearing seal.

Or drive them in, if the seal is small. By distributing the force of
the hammer blows uniformly, a seal driver lets you pop the things into
place with one or two well placed blows of a hammer. If you've a
lathe, making oil seal drivers is a spare- time sorta thing; all are
simple turnings, and aluminum or even hardwood works as well as steel.

But because of their tendency to cock in the bore, large-diameter
seals are best installed with a press or fixture. Rear axle seals are
especially troublesome due to their deeply recessed position in the
seal cover. Because of their proximity to the brakes the wiser course
is to always press-in rear axle seals.

Sermonette

With the exception of the Muir manual, books on maintaining your
Volkswagen assume a certain level of competence. Learning to tap a
seal into place with a plastic mallet isn't difficult; it's one of the
many minor skills acquired during the apprenticeship all mechanics
must endure. It is also one of the minor skills many self-taught
mechanics never bother to master. (Hint: Start with an old seal. And
an old engine case. When you can tap the thing in a dozen times in a
row without damaging either the case or the seal you're probably ready
to try it with a new seal on a good case. Along the way, you will have
learned how to remove the thing as well.) But installing a seal with a
hammer falls into the category of things a skilled mechanic can do
when the proper tools are not available; pressing in the seal is not
only safer, it's usually faster. And a pressed-into-place seal is
cheap insurance against oil leaks.
