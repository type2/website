Joel, thanks for all the neat info! I forgot one thing---Tires!! What are
your recommomendations? I'm on the second set of Bridgestone light truck
tires (603,I think) on my Vanagon, and they're great! I'd like to put
Michelins on this '69,though,but I'd like to hear any
opinions,experiences,etc.
My Isetta is a 300 bubble window coupe (I've changed my sig).

Thanks a million,
