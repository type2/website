&lt;To me, cars are like artwork.... people think I'm ridiculous...&gt;

I can go along with that... Yes, I agree. 
 
&lt;Oh dear...I've got both a Bus and a Bugeye...no one'll ever take me 
seriously... 8-{)&gt;

Move to TN, the land of the anything but a VW... &lt;grin!&gt; It gets worse... 95% of the guys I work with drive 3/4 ton 4wd diesel pickups. Some have plastic bull testicles hanging from the trailer hitch (meaning a REAL boy's toy). I show up in my VW Cabrio convertible with the top down... If it wasn't for an occasional visit at work from my wife and 5 year old son, they might be talking... Oh well, I like driving it!

I was thinking about getting a trailer hitch for the Cabrio to hang a cow bell or plastic bull testicles from... Might not be the same... &lt;grin!&gt;
