Subject: [T2] Squealing brakes

I replaced my rear brakes on my '72 camper in June/July.  The drums were
'new' and turned.  New brake shoes, springs, clips, do hickeys and wheel
cylinders.  They were adjusted and bled by Midas and worked great.  Now, the
ebrake can be pulled 3/4 of the way out before it's stiff and even then
doesn't hold real well, and the brakes screech a terrific din when I brake.
If I brake very softly, I can hear the squeal come and go at intervals.
That means my shoes or drums aren't round anymore right?  More oval or
something?  If I press the brakes harder, they squeal a constant and steady
piercing pitch.  If I really press down, they quiet down somewhat.  I
haven't pulled em off yet as we'll be moving Karen this weekend and week and
she's been driving Russ daily.  I guess I'm just asking for some quick
thoughts or advice about parts &amp; potions I might need etc. before I pull the
drums off.  I've found that once they come off, the parts I need are never
in and Russ ends up stuck for a week minimum on jack stands with no wheels,
etc.

TIA!
