Subject: I found an engine!!!

Hello List,

I just wanted to write and let you know that I have
found an engine. Luckily, I found one locally. THe guy
is suppose to get it running and let me listen to it
before I buy it. Other than asking him to let me do a
compression test, what other things do I need to
inqure about. It is in a vw junk yard so the guy
doesn't know much of the history on it. Thanks again
for everyone's help. Cross your fingers for me!!! ;0)

Have a great day!

David Kelly
