Subject: RE: [T2] door seals

I just installed both doors seals today that I got from Bus Depot.
They went on perfectly and the doors both close like they were new.   I
was really worried, from reading former posts, that the doors would
close hard, but they don't.   I'm really happy with the seals.

Anyone have experience with the German set Ron at Bus Depot sells?  I
know they are also not like the OG stuff, but if they fit better than
what I have I'm okay with spending the $60 per door.
