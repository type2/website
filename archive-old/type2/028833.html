&gt; Is there an easy way to VISUALLY tell the difference between a 78 and
&gt; 79?  I know they have different exhausts, but is it an apparent
&gt; difference?  There is a bus I'm purchasing and it's a 78 and I just want
&gt; to make sure it's not a 79 engine.


&gt; A dead give away is the chassis number the third digit is the
&gt; last digit in the year. i.e. 218 bla bla bla is a 68 or 78. FYI 68 and 69
have only 9
&gt; digits and 70-79 have 10. Be careful with the engine code here as both 78
&gt; and 79 are GE. 78 is GE 0 007 083 thru GE 0 039 331 and 79 is GE 0 039 332
&gt; thru GE 0 058 786. The exhaust on the 75-78 has a triangular flange on the
&gt; rear of the heat exchanger that the exhaust pipes attach to. Good luck



I'll add a couple of comments here. First of all, when checking the engine
code, always look at the top of the block, not on the fan shroud.  The
engine code is stamped on both. But since fan shrouds are interchangeable
between years, all that you can tell if you look at the stamping on the
shroud is the year of the _fan shroud_, not the engine.  More than once I
have seen someone replace their engine with one of a different year, but use
the shroud from their original engine.  The code on the top of the block,
near the oil breather, is the place to look.

Also, looking at the heat exchanger flange will very likely, but not
definately, determine the year of the engine.  If the heat exchanger has a
triangular flange to the exhaust, then it is indeed a '75-78 heat exchanger,
hence a '75-78 engine. But if it has a trapezoidal flange, it could be a '79
heat exchanger (likely), or a '72-74 one (less likely, but possible as they
will fit onto '75-78 heads).
