&gt; Bus.  Any secrets, or straight forward?  Bleeding
&gt; secrets?  Oh Yeah, gonna replace front pads while I am
&gt; at it too. (sat for 6 years)  Secrets for that?

my 78 doesn't like the new versions of &quot;organic&quot; brake pads, stick with
the Bi-Metalic pads...   get a nice drift punch #30 size or there abouts
best thing to get the pins out.

oh, bleed from the furtherest wheel from the brake cyl and work closer,
 also drain a lot of brake fluid out of the resivoir before starting, when
you push the calipers back for the new pads that fluid goes back into the
resevoir
