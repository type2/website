&gt; Everything else being equal, the endplay is probably OK if the engine is
&gt; basically sound to begin with.  Checking the endplay is one of those
things
&gt; you do just to be sure.  It's best done with a dial gauge, but can also be
&gt; done using feeler gauges.
&gt;
&gt; Dial gauge:
&gt; Install the 3 shims, but no oil seal, and torque the flywheel down

Good report, Tom- just a few suggestions:
An existing endplay can be checked as installed for limit without
disassembly.
The preferred repair is to start with two shims, and calculate the third.
A full stack might be too much, and crush the thrust bearing with torque.
An accurate dial indicator can read the full dimension with no shims.
