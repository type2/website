Subject: Engine tune up

Hi,

I read your advice to put nothing on spark plugs when installing them. I was
told to put cupper spray on it to prevent them being stuck in their gap.
Wrong?

And as we leave in two months for a ride of about 15.000 km, how regular do
you advice to tune up the engine, considering that we did not drive much kms
last years?

BTW, it's a 1600.

Tx and Belgian greetings,
Bart
