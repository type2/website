Subject: Thermostat conclusion

I loosened the thermostat cable and the flaps opened right.  Also the 
thermostat did not shrink back down.  I am not sure what size it should
shrink to but the picture in &quot;how to rebuild your air cooled VW&quot; showed it 
much smaller than mine (bently only shows it expanded I believe).  I called
my local Flaps and they can get one  by tomarrow morning for about $15.
That sounds cheap enough.  I should mention that heating and cooling mine with
the stove did nothing to increase/decrease its length.
Good thing I only drove a few miles (at night) with those flaps shut!!!

I hope to pull the two missing piece of tin (the two lower most pieces that
attach to the heat exchangers) off of my parts '73 bus (I hope that has them).

Does anyone know if these parts will fit a '77 bus?
