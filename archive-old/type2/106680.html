I think that condenser is for radio interference suppression???

&gt;Can I reinstall my new alternator with out it?

If that's what it's for, you can leave it off, though you may get 
background noise from the radio without it. If you can read the rating on 
it, you might pick up something similar at Radio Shack, or nab one from a 
salvage yard.
