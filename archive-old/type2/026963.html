According to the law of intermediate metals for thermocouples, your two 
junctions with the copper extension wires, should be at the same 
temperature, in order not to contribute their own nett voltage signal.

Instead of using ordinary copper wire, I have used foil &amp; copper braided, 
low-low, screened, twisted-pairs cable (as used in computer networks and 
telecommunications) to minimise capacitive and inductive signal noise. This 
is coonected at either end using 5-pin audio DIN plugs.

&gt;
&gt;Thermocouples are made from dissimilar metals (2) joined at
&gt;one end. They produce a small unique voltage at a given
&gt;temperature. IF you add regular copper wire into the ckt
&gt;make sure it is the same size for both legs. Splice it in
&gt;so that you are going into your meter with the thermocouple
&gt;wire.
&gt;                      splice      splice
&gt;thermocouple-----------[]---------[]---------------meter
&gt;             thermowire   Cu wire     thermowire
&gt;
&gt;the splice(s) should be in an area where there is no large
&gt;temperature difference between them. This insures that the
&gt;splice error contribution cancels out.
&gt;
&gt;   In Short : A thermocouple produces it's own voltage. It
&gt;is  a thermoelectric voltage produced at the junction of
&gt;two dissimilar metal wires when heated/cooled and is
&gt;interperated by a thermocouple thermometer (guage).
&gt;   Don't add on regular wire at the end. Splice a length
&gt;into the overall length and run thermocouple wire into your
&gt;guage.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;I just purchased and *almost* installed a VDO cylender
&gt;head temp gauge.
&gt; &gt;I am assuming that this gauge isnt nuclear powered and
&gt;will require
&gt; &gt;power.
&gt; &gt;So how does this bubba hook up?
&gt;
&gt;As a matter of fact, it is nuclear powered. Seriously, I
&gt;don't know what
&gt;powers it, but no 12 volt power is required.
&gt;VDO has a website with instructions for all their gauges.
