Subject: Australian VW Nationals

Hi,
I've been posting the pics of the Aussie VW Nationals
held over the Easter Weekend on my homepage &amp; I'm
sorry it's taken a while to put these up but it should
give you guys some idea of the scene here in
Australia.
Some of the thumbnails may not have links but I'm
working on that so check again later if there's
something you really want to see that isn't linked to
the full sized pic yet.

You can see pics of the drag racing at:

Show &amp; Shine Pics can be seen at:
http://www.geocities_dot_com/kombi1976/2002Nationals/ShowNShine/ShowNShine.htm

Check em out!
:-)
Cheers
