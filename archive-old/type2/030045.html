Two ways:

Get a tap that is a bit larger than the ID of the bushing and thread it
into the bushing.  Pull out the tap and bushing together.

Get a metal rod that just fits into the bushing freely.  Fill the bushing
hole with grease, trying to minimize the amount of air in the hole.  Put
the rod in and tap it with a hammer.  Hydraulic pressure will push the
bushing out intact.  This method may not be the best on a VW starting
bushing because the hole isn't truly blind.  You'll put a lot of stress on
the engine mounting flange.

Another idea I haven't tried:
Remove the upper left engine mount bolt (you've already removed the upper
right bolt with the starter).  Remove the nuts from the lower engine mount
bolts.  Support the transmssion on the bell-housing end.  Separate the
engine and transmission by a distance of slightly more than the length of
the bushing.  There may be enough flex in the engine mounts to allow this,
but don't force anything too much!  Tap the bushing out from the front
side and it'll fall into the gap between the engine and transmission.

&gt; Hello again list,
&gt; 
&gt;    I am in the process of replacing my 71 bus starter. The new rebuilt one 
&gt; came with a bushing and said that it must be installed or it will result in 
&gt; a no start. This being said I am trying to get the bushing out and not 
&gt; having any luck. Any Ideas? Does it need to be replaced?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;
