Subject: Westy needs a new home.

I have a 1971 Westfalia camper, tan, missing an engine, that needs a new 
home.  It has been sitting in my backyard for over a year and my wife says it 
has to go and soon.  I already have two other buses sucking my wallet dry so 
I can't afford to rehabilitate this one.  It has all the original stock 
camping gear except for the quarter seat in the back and the interior is 
really clean and in great shape with the exception of the two front seats.  
The exterior is very straight and in great shape with the exception of some 
minor rust spots.  It is a poptop and the top works but canvas needs 
repairing.  As far as I can tell all it needs is an engine and some routine 
maintenance to get it back on the road.  I am asking $500 dollars for it but 
will accept nearly any serious offer at this time.  I will even mail 
extensive photos of all details to any serious buyers.  Don't let this bus 
end up in the junkyard.  It is way too nice for that.
