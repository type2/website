&gt; My Dad's Air-cooled 1982 California-spec Vanagon westy went for it's final
&gt; emissions check (after this it's old enough not to need another), and it
&gt; failed due to high Carbon Monoxide emissions. Here's the score:
&gt;
&gt; HC ppm    Limit 136   Score 84
&gt; CO%                 1.28          1.62
&gt; NOppm               1784         952
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Notice that the HC and NO are better than 30% below the limit, but the CO
%
&gt; is almost 30% over the limit.  When the westy was tested 2 years ago it
&gt; passed with flying colours, so Dad was really surprised when it failed
this
&gt; time around.
&gt;
&gt; When we had the clutch replaced recently, Denmeister noticed that the O2
&gt; sensor was disconnected, so he hooked it back up. Dad seemed to think the
&gt; Bus got a bit more powerful (or perhaps just a bit less hesitant) since.
&gt; Could this have had an impact on the CO reading, or should we be looking
at
&gt; something else. I don't think it's running rich, if it was then the HC
would
&gt; be higher, wouldn't it?

Good news and good news......
1st:  I ordered a new catalytic converter last Monday from Bus Depot to
hopefully fix this same problem on my daughters 77 Westy. I told them I
needed it by Friday and paid extra for 3 day UPS. It came Thursday. Thank
you Bus Depot and UPS!

2nd: Here are the failing tailpipe figure:

              HC max  meas     CO max  meas  NoX max  meas
15mph       201    140               1.3    2.16            1314  1130
25mph       168    121               1.1    2.12            1174    924

Then this morning I put the new cat on. I made NO other changes,
adjustments, etc.

15mph                   170                        1.25
556
25mph                   142                        1.38
103

It passed with no problem. I have no explaination on why the HC went up, but
it was still below the max allowable. This should fix you Vanagon also. $125
well spent.......
