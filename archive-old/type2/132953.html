Subject: RE: [T2] where does this wire go?

Jason-

I have this exact same set of wires, and they were all disconnected when I
bought my bus. I have no idea where they go. My side markers are
connected, and I don't think they have anything to do with that. 

The 2 wires (one ground brown wire and one positive black wire) that power
the side markers *should* come from each respective tail light housing.
Usually from the bottom, but i've seen many variations.


If you ever find out what these wires are for please let me know!

thanks
Eddie Goodwin
