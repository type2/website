Subject: Re: [T2] BRAKE LIGHTS

Hi Darren,

&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; Me, the guy with the 72 van.

What, you're no longer Canadian?? (LOL)

&gt; just wondering if anyone knows any troubleshooting methods for the 
&gt; brake lights?

&gt; if the brakes need bleeding could that effect the brake lights?
AFAIK, No.  If the brakes work the lights work too.

&gt; could it be the booster?
No. Come to think about it, even if the brakes fail the lights still 
work.

&gt; is there a relay switch on the fuse box for the brake lights?
No. The switch is on the master cylinder. There is a fuse on that 
circuit.

&gt; i think the fuse is ok.my belief is that it is the second fuse from the 
&gt; end
&gt; starting to count from the left it is the second last one on the right 
&gt; side?sound correct?

I can't tell from here, I am at the office and have no manual available. 
Check ALL of the fuses, it won't take long.

&gt; any way to test the wires at the booster?

I'd suggest you start at the bulbs, and work forward. Quite often the 
bulbs are blown or the contacts are corroded. The contacts are easy to 
clean with a small scrap of sandpaper. Put a big brick on the brake 
pedal and check for voltage at the bulb housing. Also check to make sure 
there is a good ground from the housing to the body of the bus. If there 
isn't any voltage at the bulb housing THEN move up to test for voltage 
at the master cylinder.

&gt; thanks,
&gt; Darren

Happy trails,
