Subject: Re: [T2] Horrible acceleration

Carbs.

You're going to have look further than that though.

Going to have to do a compression test, did you check the timing with the 
engine running (timing light)?, buy a Bentley manual and run the whole carb 
tuning procedure. Muir's Idiot book will help you put it in layman's terms.

All the pinging and run on are telling you there is a problem. Don't leave 
it like this and drive it much longer or you risk ruining something.
