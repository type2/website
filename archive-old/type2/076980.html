&gt; Hey everybody,
&gt; I have gone crazy looking for parts for my Type2 and Type3.  I decided,
&gt; since I got layed off, that I would work a few days a week at Reborn Parts
&gt; (http://www.rebornparts_dot_com).
&gt; 
&gt; I found a treasure trove of parts that are warehoused.  Besides that there
&gt; are at least 100 T2s in the yard!  If you are looking for parts, these
&gt; guys would be the ones to ask.
&gt; 
&gt; You can call them at 719/633-9966.  Email them at sales_at_rebornparts_dot_com
&gt; 
&gt; Take care and happy VeeDubbing!
