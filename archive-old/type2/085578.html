Subject: Re: [T2] Gas Cap

Not quite the right year for advice but I bought a very nice German gas cap
for my 78 from busdepot.

It was also hard to get off at first: the seal seemed too thickat first. I
found that this variety of gas cap can go ontwo ways: start vertical the
twist 90 degrees clockwise, or start horizontal and turn 90 degrees
clockwise.  You get far more leverage the first way.

&gt; I have to spray a bit of silicone spray on my gas cap to get it off and on
&gt; from time to time.
&gt; 
&gt; Not good if you have an O2 sensor as I think silicone will poison it.
&gt; 
&gt; On my gas cap it is friction between the gasket&amp;cap and gasket&amp;filler neck.
&gt; 
&gt; Silicone makes it slide around easily and all is well.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hey Chris,
&gt;&gt;&gt; I had to put 2 gaskets on my gas cap to make sure it sealed. My filler neck
&gt;&gt;&gt; had worn so much I couldn't get a tight seal. I posted about 2 years ago
&gt;&gt;&gt; when this happened that I actually spun the DC out on a slow left hand turn
&gt;&gt;&gt; where the gas spilled out onto my right rear tire causing a severe loss of
&gt;&gt;&gt; traction. The only fix for me was 2 gaskets on the stock cap.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; we need a compromise I can hardly get my gas cap on and off sometimes when
&gt;&gt; the gas jockey put it on tight it is next to impossible to get off.....
