&gt;Chris, Chuck: 
&gt;I think I'd drain and flush the fuel tank and probably have to take the carb 
apart and clean it out too. Then of course the brakes
&gt;will be totally toast. Every hydraulic cylinder will be rusted. At least 
that's how it is here in the midwest. Sitting is much harder on
&gt;brakes because the accumulated water in the brake fluid never gets boiled 
off! Making a long-time non-runner driveable again is
&gt;a big piece of work. Al Brase 
&gt;69 double cab 


I think I would probably just try to start it with the least amount of work 
possible. plus the brakes come into play until you have 
the engine started. Carb might need a little fuel or quick start sprayed down 
the venturi while holding he cam open. Maybe I'd
pour a little dry gas and some fresh super unleaded in the tank, but I would 
replace the wheel cylinders to get the engine started.
