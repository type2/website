hi all,

this weekend i headed up to wisconsin to hang out with i. hanback from
ripon... the gentleman i had an argument with.

We had a lot of fun, and i got to meet billy knudsen from up there too :)
(well, meet him again... we had run into each other at probably 6 campouts
but never really talked...)

I's new (to him) 63 bus is pretty cool... he is so happy to have it that
it is neat to see, i am very glad that he will enjoy and restore it to a
driver... its a big project but i think he can do it.

We went to a junkyard near his house and got a few good parts, that was a
lot of fun too. ('cept i caught a cold and my hands look like a hamburger
from all the skinned knuckles.)

I learned that the application of heat from a propane torch and kroil to
quench the heat can loose almost ANY stuck bolt.  I will take these two
things with me wherever i go now, what a godsend :)

I also got to use my new impact screwdriver... it didnt really seem to do
much good... whats the trict to one of these things?? do you need a REALLY
big hammer, or do you just have to bang for a long time???

What really amazes me is how this life thing can throw you a curve ball,
what starts out as an acrimonious situation can lead to a good friendship.
I. seems like a very honest and enthusiastic VW owner, i feel really bad
for having dragged him through the mud.  He has turned me on to some other
busses for sale and i think before too long i'll have a splitty that is
worthy of driving :)

I think after a few years of volkswagen ownership i am finally turning
into a mechanic instead of a parts replacement guy.  It amazed me that
issaiah was having a problem with his bus not running right and when he
told me the symptoms i said &quot;choke misadjusted.&quot; and lo and behold, thats
exactly what we found.  I did the same thing recently with a friend that
had vanagon FI problems, its scary really, all i can say is when i first
got into this thing i had no clue and filled the list with silly,  posts.
I would fret over every noise and ask how to fix it.  I have to laugh at
the way i was and it also makes me very tolerant of newcomers... i want to
give them the same tolerance and patience i was shown as a newbie. And now
i can actually contribute and help others, its cool..

On an interesting side note, my bus has been back on the road for exactly
2 years this month, and in that time i have driven 40k miles almost
exactly (turned over to 92k+ this trip, it had 52k on the odo when i got
it going in oct 97..)

i have had a lot of fun racking up those miles and i show no signs of
slowing down... i hope i have many more good bus miles to come...

all in all a great trip and everything just felt right.  

To me, things arent worth arguing over, theyre just inanimate objects that
we will never be able to take with us when we go.... but having good
relationships with people is where its at. I think that IS something you
can take with you and a legacy you can leave behind.

so in summary:  drive your bus, be kind to one another no matter what
happens.

peas,

Steve
