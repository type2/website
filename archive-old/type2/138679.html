Subject: RE: [T2] Tire noise

&gt;From: Richard Atwell

&gt;There is a repetitive noise that's been driving me nuts lately and I seemed
&gt;to have traced it to one of my Continental CR21 tires that I bought 2 years
&gt;ago.

&gt;If I rotate tires, the noise moves with the tire. I'm not sure what to be
&gt;glad of at this point although it's sort of a relief it's not CV or bearing
&gt;noise. Anyway, the tire looks perfectly fine to the eye.

&gt;Has anyone had a similar experience?

&gt;PS. Along with proper tire inflation, keep the front end lubed. It makes
&gt;steering so much easier. I always forget about this.


Wes Brown had a problem like this not long ago. April 1, 2004 he called me 
from the road and said he found the problem and his bus had found a ditch 
and a guard rail. That part was a joke due to the date. We looked at it 
before he left. He thought it might be a ball joint or something similar 
with the suspension. 50 miles down the road from my house he found a buldged 
lump had formed although it was not there before. Keep an eye on it. Maybe 
have it checked for balance. It sounds like it is associated with that 
tire/wheel if the sound moves when they are rotated. Did you get any type of 
warranty with them? Even with depreciation it could help if you have to get 
a new one or get it balanced.

Good Luck,
