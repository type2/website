hey now,

amanda and i had just pulled onto hillsborough street after coming home from
visiting my folks on monday. i noticed a '79 Westy pulled into the entrance
of Meredith College and the driver looking rather distraught. i couldn't turn
so i went down the block and came back to see if he needed help. he did!

poor guy. had a flat tire. and said he didn't have the little hook thingy-ma-
jig to get off the hubcap. i said no problem and took a long screw driver and
popped it off in about 30 seconds. the second problem stumped me. he had his
wheel jack out and we couldn't figure it out. how does it fit in the little
slots. call me stupid. i do all my tuneup stuff now but i couldn't figure out
how to use the stock vw jack. duh. i even took mine out but couldn't figure
it out. so, and i know you aren't supposed to do this, but i got my floor jack,
and put it under his bus.

next we went after them lug nuts. boy, they were hard to get off. and the vw
stock lug wrench don't help. the lug nuts took us and liquid wrench about 45
minutes to get off. i'm adding a cheater bar onto my list of things to carry
round in the van. that would have helped alot!

anyways, we eventually get his tire changed and back on the road. he had a
NICE '79 Westy that was recently painted. it shined. he said he bought it
from the original owner for $3000. i was jealous. interior was perfect.

add this event to the neverending book of learning...
