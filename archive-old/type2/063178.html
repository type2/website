Subject: re:old cases and faying surfaces

&gt;What I fail to understand is where the aluminium oxide comes from.  I 
&gt;always heard that the VW cases were magnesium, not aluminum.  Or are 
&gt;they an alloy of both.  I know they burn like mag.

I'd heard recently that the cases were made of an alloy of the two 
(magnesium &amp; aluminum) that VW called &quot;Elektron&quot;. Must be mostly 
magnesium cause I've seen Bradley's special &quot;wood&quot; that he burns in 
campfires whilst on CCC trips. Bright stuff that wood 'o his!
