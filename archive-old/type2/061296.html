Subject: westy fuel gauge problem

I have an '81 Cal. Westy which has either a bad fuel gauge or a bad tank
sender unit (or bad connections). The reading is very unpredictable; it
does not read full or empty when it should. The voltage stabilizer is
good (10V). The VW manual says to first check the gauge using VW tool
VW1301 at dial setting 55 (full) and 560
(empty). I don't have this tool and don't know what the settings signify
(ohms?), but my gauge will show full when passing about .136Amps and
empty when passing about 0.045Amps, corresponding to about 73ohms_at_10V
and 222ohms_at_10V total series resistance. The gauge itself measures about
52ohms. Can anyone confirm the gauge is OK before I try the sender unit?
Has anyone cut the hole for the sender unit repair and exactly where
does it go?
