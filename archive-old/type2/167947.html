&gt; Hey Everyone,
&gt; Does anyone know where I can get one?  My steering coupler just decided
&gt; to shred itself and it's the 4th tomorrow and I can't drive :( :(
&gt;
&gt; Anyone know where I can find one today?!
&gt;
&gt; THANKS!

   If you can't find one, try the HELP spin rack at your local FLAPS.
I used a Ford replacement coupler (same thickness) and punched
holes in it to match the VW pattern... ;-)
