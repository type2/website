Subject: Re: Michelin MX for Vanagon.

Hi Volks,
          I wrote this as private email to the guy from off-list who asked about Michelins. I thought I'd copy it to the list as well, partly to invite comment and also in case it might be useful to someone here. I've been doing some digging in the archives and so this contains some distilled information therefrom.
 Keep the bouncy bits down...

Hi,
	Saw your post, forwarded to the type2 list by the moderator.

 If you have web acess you might find it worth searching the archives of the various VW bus lists- in particular the vanagon list (www.vanagon_dot_com, logically enough) has a ridiculous amount of information about tyres. There's also a FAQ/tech questions section that recommends tyres, though I think the ones they recommend are the ones you couldn't find.

 The concensus seems to be that the tyres that generally work best for most listees are 185R14C &quot;Light Truck&quot; tyres. That is &quot;LT185R14C&quot; rating. However it all seems to get pretty complicated when you try to buy them, especially since the tyre-jocks think you can get by with regular passenger car tyres. In fact, you often can, if you run the bus light. However if you carry any sort of load, or have a camper you'll likely exceed the maximum weight specifications of said tyres.
You will almost certainly find that you get lots of body-roll on corners and alarming instability in cross-winds and truck &quot;washes&quot;.
 The fact that Michelin seems to be running down production of appropriate tyres seems to be making life more difficult than necessary, too. I have been browsing tyre manufacturers websites and had also noticed that Michelin don't seem to be selling the classic XZX (or whatever) tyre that works well on a vanagon anymore. I suspect that they are being supplied out of old stock at the moment, but that's really just a guess.
 As far as choosing good tyres is concerned my recommendations (and those of other listees) would be to look for:

 (1) an &quot;LT&quot; designation, with &quot;Load range C&quot; or &quot;Load range D&quot;.
 (2) the &quot;C&quot; suffix on the tyre designation- ie 185R14C _not_ 185R14
 (3) A maximum inflation pressure of 50-60psi. not 40psi
 (4) A maximum weight rating of over 1500lbs.

 Although I am talking only about 185R14 sized tyres you should be aware that VW specified 195R14 as a valid alternative, so you can use those, too. It's perfectly possible to go with some other sizes- 195/75R14, for example, or possibly 215/70R14, however you are then diverting sufficiently far from stock that you should make sure you understand the implications of the size, speed and weight ratings, sidewall stiffness and tread design before going ahead- unfortunately you can't trust the tyre-people to do this right as they often don't have the knowledge and experience to know what works well on a bus. The weight ratings of &quot;Passenger car&quot; tyres are different from those of &quot;Light Truck&quot; tyres- hence the preference for the &quot;LT&quot;s
 If you're looking at passenger car tyres then you might find it useful to know that VW specified a load index of 97R to be appropriate for a vanagon. That's a weight rating of 1609lbs at a maximum of 106mph, if memory serves. Most arn't this high- 92 or 94 is more common.
 I can't recommend any particular tyre to you- especially since I'm in the UK so the products will likely be different anyway. I couldn't get the Michelin tyre selector on their web page to come up with anything that seemed appropriate for a bus (just a &quot;rain&quot; tyre) and Goodyear's didn't come up with anything in a 185R14. I think that Kumho do a 185R14C tyre (in both load range C and load range D versions), which is called the &quot;852&quot;: That looks like a good bet, though I've no personal experience. There must be others, though Listees don't seem much impressed by Continentals.
 On my '77 bus at the moment I have two Uniroyals, a &quot;Maxmiler&quot; and an &quot;India&quot; (India is a Goodyear budget brand). All are (LT) 185R14C designation- two 6-ply and two 8-ply rated. The PO had ONE 185R14 passenger tyre on a rear wheel that had a maximum inflation pressure of 40psi and no &quot;load range&quot; rating- Yuk!

 Hope this is some help. If you want to change your new tyres (I'd recommend it) and the dealer gets difficult you could check whether the maximum load of your bus (the maximum Gross vehicle weight), which should be on the plate behind the seats in the cab, exceeds the rating of the tyres they supplied. And/Or whether the specified inflation pressure for full load at the rear wheels (I think it's well over 40psi) exceeds the rating on the tyres. If either of these holds true then I can't see them managing to hold to a claim that they are appropriate. So you should at the very least be able to get credit for them. Just don't let them bullshit you :-).
 I think the GVW of a vanagon is around 6000lbs (2700Kg) so for safety the tyres ought to be rated to take at least a quarter of that.

Good luck, and let us know how you got on!

Cheers,
	W.
