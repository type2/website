Subject: RE: [T2] VPC Air Conditioner for Station Wagon

&gt; I was thinking of installing the York first to see how it 
&gt; should have been when installed by the dealer. Then 
&gt; eventually shifting to a rotary compressor to have a more 
&gt; efficient set up.


Just go right to the Sanden rotary compressor. It's much more modern and
efficient. That's why VW themselves switched to it starting with the
Vanagon. 

We do sell a retrofit kit for replacing the York with a Sanden (although
some fabrication is still required). We also sell new Sanden and York
compressors.
