Hello listmembers,

I know there has been this 'whatsit'? kinda contest thing going on lately, 
and here is one that I do not know the answer to.

There was this thing in the ashtray of my bus when I bought it from the PO. 
It looks like some kind of map light that you stick someplace, I thought 
maybe that wierd hole under the glovebox, but it doesnt fit.
any ideas?

Here are the pictures.
