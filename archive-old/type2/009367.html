One day, while peering into the engine compartment of Michael Wagner's 
1976 Westy, I noticed that he didn't have a decel valve. Nor was there 
any sign that his firewall ever held the bracket for one. 

(Sorry I am telling tales out of school, Michael, but this has been 
bugging me for months).

Could this have been a stock configuration? Does the decel valve make so 
little contribution to smooth deceleration that the valve can be ditched?

In the interest of eliminating points of potential failure ...
