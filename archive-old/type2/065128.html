Subject: Re: The Simpsons and VW's

&gt; 
&gt; Speaking of TV shows containing VW's a few episodes of the Simpson's (my
&gt; favorite show) show VW's (or artists renderings of VWs) usually in very
&gt; stereotypical situations.  The episode that always sticks out in my mind
&gt; is the one where Homer's meets his long lost mother.  At the end she
&gt; leaves on a electric powered bus.  I also believe that in the episode were
&gt; Bart and Lisa go to Camp Krusty they show a Bug.  School ends for the summer,
&gt; all the gets run out excited and a group of them rock/tip over a Bug.
&gt; Just some observations,
&gt; brett
Brett,
I remember that one :) .  Homer and his mom are saying a long goodbye
and a fried-out hippie leans out the window and says &quot;Hurry up man --
I've only got 20 minutes of juice left!&quot;
