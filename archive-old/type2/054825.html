Patrick O. Dolan sends:

&gt; Is there a preferred way to remove them, other than dousing the hell out of
&gt; them with penetrating fluid and putting a visegrip on them?  I don't have
&gt; access to a welder to weld a bolt head or nut of any sort on them.  Am I
&gt; asking for trouble with my visegrip method?

The only problem with using a vise grip to remove a bolt is that you'll ruin
the threads on the bolt. Since this bolt is going straight in the trash the
instant you get it out, I somehow doubt you care about the threads on it.

Douse away.
