&gt; No matter what brand or type of torque wrench you buy, please remember
that
&gt; when you are finished with it for the day, to unwind the micrometer handle
&gt; to relieve the internal spring tension. If you don't relieve the spring
&gt; tension the torque wrench will become uncalibrated that much quicker.
 
It depends on the style. The nice snapon unit Karl mentioned that went from
40-250lbs. doesn't require this action by design.
