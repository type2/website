---SNIP---Thing I hate is the acess to the damn-thing, on a wasserboxer
it is a breeze as you just reach at it from the engine compartment, on
the air cooled that darn rear bolt against the firewall is nightmarish if
rusted (de facto in WV on any 15 year old Van)--SNIP---

Now that you mention it, it IS a pain.  I can't seem to get the support
bracket that goes from the side of the Vanagon trans up to the slave
mounting bracket close enough to get the bolt started.  I did change
trannies, but you wouldn't think this would matter.  Anyone else have
this problem?  If so, any hints? Thanks.
