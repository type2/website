Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Fire Survial

&gt;  The engine seal had caught fire.

	This very important part is needlessly expensive compared 
with Armathane (Armstrong corp of Canada) closed-cell foam crammed in 
all around the gap.  This material is sold as exterior thermal 
insulation for hot-water pipes.
	The cooling system of these vehicles primarily depends on 
maximising the pressure surplus in the engine compartment so that the 
fan can pass the most air per s down past the cooling fins.  The 
gasket around the engine perimeter can develop large holes, degrading 
this precious pressure surplus.  Stopping leaks from that engine 
compartment is essential to good cooling of the engine.  But the 
official gasket is needlessly expensive compared with a yard or so of 
Armathane.



&gt;   I wish I had a head
&gt;temp gauge (should have had one).

	Some aircraft have this instrument in the form of a 
substitute for a spark-plug washer.  I would be very interested to 
acquire one or two of these.
	Oil T is another option.  I slapped an oil thermometer on the 
dipstick of my '57 splittie, and was grateful for it  -  e.g it 
provided the proof that my aluminium strips at the rear of the flush 
intake louvres lowered the cruising T in a big way.  The factory 
quietly copied this idea with the high-level scoop intakes at the end 
of the '60s.  So some good did come of all that stirring at Berkeley 
in the latter half of the '60s   '-).
	 I add that I consider oil P more informative, in general, than oil T.
