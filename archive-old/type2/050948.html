Subject: [T2] door compatability

Hello list.

 I want to thank everyone for their response on the
rust free doors that I inquired about. I have another
annoying question. Are all doors compatable from
1968-1979 on transporters? I heard wispers that some
door hinges will not work with different models. If
so, what doors are compatable with a 1973 transporter?

If I am completely wrong, please excuse me.

Thanks!
David Kelly
