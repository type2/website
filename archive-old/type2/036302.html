&gt; All,
&gt; 
&gt; Geez, and I thought Click-N-Clack were idiots...now we
&gt; get to hear it from the 'touchy-feelies' on NPR, too!
&gt; 
&gt; The difference between my friends listed above and the
&gt; fools who called into the program, is that the callers
&gt; don't know what value is. They buy into the hype on tv
&gt; about how safe and environmentally safe the new
&gt; $30,000.00 Honda Accord is.

its the only way they can sell them, i'll be the first to tell you my
bus polutes like hell, for the size of the engine, probably puts out
just as much as a new jeep V8

&gt; 
&gt; Sure, they don't need much maintenance compared our
&gt; busses (not over the short-haul, anyway)...but what
&gt; about that $30,000.00 + high-end insurance??????!!!!!

working on my bus is well frustrateing at times, but most of the time a
pleasure. espeshaly since i do it at my leasure finaly getting that
alternator back in.....
 
&gt; Also, what happens the very day they make that last
&gt; car-payment??? &quot;Gee, honey, this car's almost *five*
&gt; years old....it's a junker! What say we trade it in on
&gt; a new one??????&quot; The cycle is repeated, again and
&gt; again.

our nabors used to buy a new car every year, never could understand why.
except at the auto show, i was sitting in one of those new mercedies
wagons, the big ones. i love those seats, any chance i could put one in
my bus??

&gt; 
&gt; People get sucked into this
&gt; &quot;newer-is-better-and-if-*it's*-better-then-*I'm*-better&quot;
&gt; brand of consumerism. Hey, I was there once myself; I
&gt; even bought a brand new Hyundai, which truly *is* the
&gt; worst car of the Millenium!

the only new car id consider buying would be a porsche (in my dreams),
and IF i did id pull off all the crap it dosent need, AC, power seats
ect ect.. but then again id rather get a used one.... cheeper and i dont
have to worry about depreciation.... 
 
&gt; Never again. Not for me, anyway.

i dont think ive ever had a new car, except my dad bought a 81 dasher
desiel brand new right of the lot.. was a great car, except it blew the
head gasket alot... and the AC died in a O-zone destroying mushroom
cloud.
 
&gt; Why is it that most people today want the newest,
&gt; fastest, most luxurious car available; but we bus
&gt; owners want the oldest, slowest, least luxurious
&gt; vehicles around????!!! ;-)

I resent that! i find my bus quite comfortable and its actualy faster
then my 88 volvo until about 60.. then the bus starts to max out and the
volvo will slowly accelarate to about 100..


&gt; Is it because we are stupid, or is it because we
&gt; understand what true value is?

maybe value to some people isnt about how they feel but rather how
trendy the viecal they drive, or the clothse they were.. ect ect..
someone said in a post a while back. &quot;i know civilzation is doomed when
we all have to drive a 10 ton urben asult viecal to the corner store to
remain popular&quot; or something along the lines of that..
 
&gt; One last little rant, then I'll get off the
&gt; soap-box... Just after moving here, a well-meaning
&gt; neighbor came by and told me he &quot;knew of a Toyota
&gt; Celica (or some other mid-'80s econobox) with a blown
&gt; head-gasket for $800.00...&quot;. He actually thought I
&gt; just bought my '69 Westy &quot;to get me by&quot;!

&gt; He was quite taken back when I told him that not only
&gt; had I spent months searching for my bus, but it was
&gt; also the best vehicle I'd ever owned. Needless to say,
&gt; that was the one and only time he ever spoke to me,
&gt; even though our kids play together every day!!!!;-)
&gt; 
&gt; I guess it's just as well that these folks keep their
&gt; heads in the sand.....it means more parts for the rest
&gt; of us;-)

&gt; &gt; Did anyone hear this weekends Car Talk on NPR.  The
&gt; &gt; had a show where the
&gt; &gt; audience nominated the 10 worst cars of the
&gt; &gt; millennium.  Guess what was
&gt; &gt; on that list - that's right, our beloved bus.
&gt; &gt; Comments, no handling, no
&gt; &gt; heat, no anything, a death trap in a front end
&gt; &gt; collision but then it
&gt; &gt; would be impossible to go fast enough to hit
&gt; &gt; anything in the front.
&gt; &gt; Other nominees - Chevy Vega and Chevete, Plymouth
&gt; &gt; Valarie, Fiat x 1/9,
&gt; &gt; Renualt Dalphine and Le Car, Cadilac Cimmoron, Ford
&gt; &gt; Expidition, any car
&gt; &gt; from Dihatsu, VW Thing, Ford Pinto, AMC Gremalin.
&gt; &gt; Just thught I lit you
&gt; &gt; guys know (PS I know i have some misspelling here)
