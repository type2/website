Subject: RE: [T2] Walmart Liberator tires

&gt;range C or D tire, so it's basically comparable in that regard.  I don't
&gt;recall off hand exactly what VW's recommended rear tire inflation is
&gt;supposed to be but I believe it's somewhere around 42 psi on a bus and 48 on
&gt;a Vanagon (assuming 185R14 tires)

Ron makes a real good point without relaly making it right there,
cause that is the big assumption of course, quite a few Eurovaners
are running passenger car tires with 95+ load ratings now in bigger
sizes at lower pressures to avoid the bone jarring ride.  Personally
have a set of 96 rated snows on my '93 right now and it handles
wonderfully, but it is a real suspension system, as is the Vanagon.
I've never thought the Vanagon really needs the stiffer sidewall handling
wise, yeah you get a bit more lean without it, but as long as the sidewalls
aren't obviouslly scrubbing the ground (and the will with a crappy tire)
about anything works handling wise.  As far as load goes, get more
contact patch area, can reduce the pressure you run at.

&gt;Myself, I have Hankook (Hancook?) LT tires on my Westy, Korean made I
&gt;believe, which ran me around $60 apiece and are either load range C or D, I
&gt;don't recall (D, I think).  I like the way they handle.  Someone on the
&gt;Vanagon list once complained about his Hankooks wearing out quickly, but my
&gt;first pair lasted quite a while so I bought them again.  That said, I must

This may have been Pat Horrocks, she got about 18k out of a full set
on her Syncro and had them balanced and rotated anally, her set
at least was pure junk.  They wore evenly, and quickly, to nothing.

&gt;admit that when I bought my Vanagon it had passenger car tires on it, and
&gt;while I did replace them with LT tires I didn't rush to the tire store right
&gt;away.  I drove on the passenger car tires for a couple of months until tax
&gt;return time, and lived to tell about it. :-)

I'll say it as I always have I've owned a score of Vanagons and Buses
that came with passenger tires, with some rare exceptions I've never
had trouble.  I've had two of one particular Sears Roadhandler by
Michelin blow out however (sets came on different buses) and I did
take them off promptly on the second van, got tired of it.  But they
were largely so what experiences, if you aren't an idiot and can drive
losing either a front or rear tire, or an entire rear wheel 8-) on a Bus
or Vanagon is a pretty benign experience, you let the van slow and
stop without doing anything rash.  Anyway that all said I'll insert my
standard plug for the Firestone Wilderness AT's (yeah the infamous
recalled tires but not recalled in the 27x8.5R14 I've been running) and
the Firestone Winterfire.  Both have been respectively for the $$ the
best tires I've ever owned, even better than XZX's or LTX's on vans.
As to Mr. Nemo's original Walmart Liberators, I'll warrant that if they
have a 1625lb load rating they will last fabulously and safely, he may
just need to get used to some increased feelings of body roll.  IMHO
anything with over 1525lb slapped on the sidewall will do well enough
on any VW Transporter, as will quite a few without even that.

YMMV.
