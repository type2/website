&gt; Hey open windows are best, just trying to make something out of this old

&gt; Before you have a stroke over this consider the uses - a REALLY mobile TV, 
&gt; uses less space and power than a regular TV.
&gt; 
&gt; Resolution would be crummy but hey it's free and for temporary uses only.

Actually, a 640x480 cheapo LCD monitor has better resolution than NTSC
TVs.  That's why my 34&quot; computer monitor cost 2 grand while a similar TV
could be had for less than half that cost
 
&gt; Yes Wal-mart and their cousins have $100 TV/VCR combos but I'm tinkering 
&gt; here not actually working towards a solution! &lt;grin&gt;

A good thing to do.  Not enough tinkerers around!  Sounds like a good
Junkyard Wars project!
 
&gt; Just poking at you George!

To be expected!  Just so long as the stick isn't too pointy!

BTW, Speaking of Junkyard Wars, guess who showed up on the JW newsgroup?
None other than the legendary Bob Hoover!  He's got a team trying out for
the show.
