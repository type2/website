Subject: alternator problems

Hello,
     I have been in need of some help with my alternator wireing.  I posted
to type 2 since thursday but it has been down, and we just gained access to
the archives today so i was checking for ideas, but really couldnt find what
i was looking for  My
problem...i got a 1600 dp from a bug awhile ago for my 72, it came with an
alternator, but i had a generator on my old engine and it worked so i
figured instead of messing with the wireing again i would put the gene on
the new engine and save the alternator for when the gene breaks....now i put
the alternator in lastweekend with the matching Voltage regulator...it has a
three prong male wireing harness and a male single prong,and also has a
condenser.  all the wires match up from the wireing harness to the VR except
1 its blue instead of black.  I hooked up the battery to the male prong
along with another wire it, and the condenser. every thing seemed ok,
till the next day i had no juice , the battery was dead. The VR has a
yellow, a brown, green, and black there may be a red one there not sure(been
hooking up a trailer hitch on my truck to)....what wires do i need to
connect to the VR and what wires need to go to the male prong...i hope i
explained my situation so you can understand whats going on....im moving in
3 weeks so im trying to get the bus running and im running out of free
weekends before we move
Thanks
Chad
