I have a '78 and I'm running  w/ a Weber. I considered cutting mine out too
in that the air cleaner is now sitting on top of carb.  But anytime you cut
or alter your Bus, It'll be 3 times as difficult to get it back to factory.
You never know if you or  the next owner may want to put the FI back in. I'm
keeping mine attached.
Just my 2 cents.

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; If there is anyone out there in Bus land that has ever removed the air
&gt; cleaner support bracket without tearing it or the bus up to much.  Mine
&gt; seems to be welded at the base and spot welds on the back but no amount of
&gt; drilling or cutting seems to do much gold- the damm thing won't budge. Any
&gt; and all advice will be greatly appreciated. As always, TIA TBear
&gt;
&gt; Don't take life too seriously- you'll never live through it.
