Subject: New VW Campers - SFBA community on orkut_dot_com

First of all, my apologies to folks not in the San Francisco Bay Area, 
but I've encountered several locals on this list, and I wanted to get 
maximum coverage of those folks...

Today I created a new community on orkut_dot_com, called &quot;VW Campers - 
SFBA&quot;, for owners of VW campers who live in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
  I'm hoping that this resource can be used to organize gatherings and 
trips, local parts exchanges, etc.

If you're not familiar with orkut_dot_com, it is &quot;an online community 
website designed for friends&quot; (quoted from the orkut web site) 
affiliated with Google.  Enrollment is not currently &quot;open&quot;; you must 
receive an invitation from someone who is already a member.  If you are 
interested in joining this new &quot;VW Campers - SFBA&quot; community, send me a 
pmail.

Cheers!
