Subject: Re: [T2] pit thoughts

Can speak from experience here. When my dad had his house built up here, he
specifically wanted a pit. Its about five feet deep. Didn't cost anymore to
put in. Think about it, new house they gotta dig the foundation anyway,
whats an extra 5X10 hole in the ground. Ok, little extra work to lay up
forms, but your laying in a basement anyway. Only thing that collects in his
is water, same thing that collects in the basement, but the island is a lot
a glacial slurry anyway and easily fixed with a sump pump. I can see some
limitations on a bus, but easy enough to bring a bus over a pit leaving the
engine hanging over the level surface while you unhook gas lines and heater
boxes. Lost the starter on the astro a day ago, rolled over the pit, had
that sucker out in 5min flat. With a lift though, either have to put it
outside or have an overheight garage, wonder which will cost more to build?
Someplaces outsides not practical, like today when we got 4&quot; of snow, hard
to work with heavy gloves on and the propane heater just can't keep up ; )

&gt; Tony's right about the possible dangers.  Your insurer might take a pretty
&gt; dim idea of it, too, especially if there were a fall accident.  The ones
at
&gt; the oil change places have dedicated exhaust, stairwells (2), and drainage
&gt; (you can suffer a wet floor or worse, depending on your water table, if
you
&gt; don't).
&gt;
&gt; Sure would be nice for oil changes and valve adjustments, though, wouldn't
&gt; it?
