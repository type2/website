Subject: Valve Adjustments
Content-Disposition: inline

&gt;Part of the instructions for the valve adjustment is to chock the tires,
&gt;put the vehicle in neutral, and disengage the parking brake. What does
&gt;this accomplish as re: the valves?
&gt;Nikki

well to set the valves you need to turn the crank by way of a wrench on the crank
pulley nut. If you don't take the van out of gear to do this, you will be using your
wrench like an old crank, trying to start the motor with the wrench, plus it's difficult
to turn the motor with the van in gear. So if the van is out of gear and you are working
on it without chocks, it might roll over you if there is an earthquake or some other reason like a car
parking in front of you hitting you and pushing the bus onto you. The parking brake
should be disengaged because the instructions were probably meant for the vw sedans
as well, such as the 412, which you probably need to jack up a bit to get access, and if
you jack up the back, the parking brakes are no longer effective.   At least thats my guess
for the whole thing.
