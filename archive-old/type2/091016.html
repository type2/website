 All signals are defunct, as is the driver's side brakelight and the horn, and defroster. That is all I know of as of now, not that this is not enough....I have a bentley manual, but the understanding of the diagram I don't completely have. Regarding the PO being a potential madman, I won't argue with...at least wiring wise....I also have the rest of what was mentioned..
I am sure i disconnected something when I removed the tach, no doubt, but for the life of me I can't discover what.
Will I need to remove the dash for this?
again...thanks for any contributions

Do you have a Bentley manual with color coded wiring diagrams for your year 
Bus? $25

Do you have a multi meter? $25

Crimping tool and terminals? $25

Do have the time to interact with the T2 list and learn how your electrical 
system works? 8 to 40 Hrs

By the way the idea that the turn signal relay has something to do with the 
Tach is rather far fetched. When you removed the Tach some wire may have 
been inadvertently disconnected.

The notion that new harness is easier than fixing the old one is only true 
if the wiring is burnt or the PO was a wiring madman.

What year is your bus? List ALL the electrical functions that don't work.
