Subject: Re: Bus Boys VS. Bus Stops Center console prices

&gt;hey now,
&gt;
&gt;i was just browsing through an old (1994) bus stops catalog an saw the
&gt;center consol that i bought from bus boys. i paid $90.00+ for the console.
&gt;bus stop (a division of RMMW) has them for $74.95. now i realize that prices
&gt;may have gone up in 2 years but $20?
&gt;
&gt;and for some reason, which may be of my own imagination, i was under the
&gt;impression that bus boys had these things manufactured for themselves. ie,
&gt;i thought bus boys was the only folks that had them.
&gt;
&gt;
If I'm not mistaken, the Price Club or Price Costco, whatever they call
themselves nowadays, had center consoles for minivans for about $60.00
Looked like it would've fit in a Westy between the front seats.  Also saw a
neat unit at SAMS club that contained a mini TV and VCP, which where
included.  Pretty neat item.       

Just my .02
