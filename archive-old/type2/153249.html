Subject: [T2] Southern England trip report

Hello all,

just came back from my trip to southern England. 3 weeks and 3000 miles
through Germany, Belgium, France and (mostly) England. Bus ran
absolutely great. The only tool (I always have a lot of spare parts and
tools with me... ask me why!) I needed was a screwdriver to open a dozen
of oysters...

Just before the trip I had the carbs (dual solexes on a 2000c) adjusted
and synchronized by an old vw mechanic specialized in beetles and he did
some awsome work. The engine runs very smooth, absolutely no stuttering
at all, has lots of power and oil temps are about 20F cooler (oil temp
is always way below 230F and at highway speeds (70mph) it stays around
195F). It took the mechanic about half an hour to adjust/synchronize
everything and he did not even charge me anything for doing it (just
whishing that I'm going to have a good trip). Nice guy!

Anyway, I did not see any buses at all on the Autobahn in Germany and
neither in Belgium nor France. But when travelling around the southern
coast of England from Dover to Lands End and up to Bristol I saw about
20 of them a day! Most of them were camper vans made by Devon and also
some westys that had a left hand drive (makes me think that most of them
were imported from the continent/Germany). Almost all of them were in
beautiful condition and apparently haven't been welded in the typical
places. Makes me sort of jealous, since the bottom of my bus required a
huge amount of bodywork 3 years ago.

Trip was great, wheather very fine, nice people and a good running
bus... You can't expect any more, can you?

Cheers,

Timo
