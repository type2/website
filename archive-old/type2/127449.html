&gt; Good morning,
&gt; I've been having some serious troubles with engine exhaust
&gt; finding its way into my bus. It seems that any effort i've
&gt; done to fix this problem has had no effect. The big fouler
&gt; of all this though is that the exhaust fumes are not entering
&gt; the bus through the heat ducting or the rear cargo hatch,.
&gt; Here is an explanation of everything i've checked as of now.

Alex drove by yesterday evening to get another pair of eyes on his
handy work. I have to admit this is one strange issue. That body is
sealed tight. If he didn't actually have a sensor backing up his
claims I'd say it was all in his head, but the sensor indicates large
quantities of CO. We took it for a spin, but due to rush hour didn't
get any results so I could smell the exhaust. I kinda think I smelled
it once, but not a lot. He has completely sealed up all sorts of
things in the bus. When he left about all I could contribute was to
continue sealing/taping gaps untill something made a difference. The
other possibility, was to extend the tailpipe temporarily to see if
that helps. He is also going to tape down the riveria poptop at the
rear to see if exhaust is creaping in there.

it was nice to visit w/ a fellow t2er. I have to admit I forgot how
quite those late bays are compared to my 66. :)
