Subject: DEAD BUS*?$_at_! HELP

I will try to keep this short.  When my bus gets hot, as in runs for a while, 
it idles rough and wants to stall out.  Well, yesterday it stalled and died!  
there is no power what so ever.  I just replaced my voltage regulator, and 
had it test at shmucks.  and everything was good.  This is my everyday ride, 
so any help you may give would be VERY appreciated.  I called a couple places 
here localy and they told two diffrent thing and contridicted each other 
telling me the other was wrong. So now i am really confused!!
