Hi,

There seems to be some confusion :( I sold the Westfakia about a 
month ago to Joel Wilson who is in the process of converting it into 
a diesel (just kidding:) The Westfakia was present at the campout but 
I was not driving it. I was in the recently purchased Westfunkia: a 
pastel white 1972 Canadian spec Westfalia conversion.

If you have a sunroof bus you can easily retrofit a 1968 to 1973 
Westy top to it. For that matter I think a 74 to 79 will fit just 
fine but the those years are not sunroof buses. You may have seen a 
post earlier today or so from Richard Palmer about a 1971 high roof 
camper that is toast but has a decent roof. Go get the bus and put 
the roof on yours :)

&gt;How did you do it? Did you custom make the tent and pop-up for a sunroof?
&gt;Wow. It looks GREAT.
