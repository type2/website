&gt; In really hot conditions those hoses might be useful in keeping the heat
&gt; off the fuel lines and tank and keeping it from vapor locking. They were
&gt; put in about the same time as that lovely aluminum insulation pad under
&gt; the  fuel tank (78 or so?).

Could be. I'm sure those savvy VW engineers added this feature for SOME 
reason. I have two questions for the group at large:

1.) What year were these heater air pipes added? What was there on the 
previous year's model?

2.) Just what is a &quot;vapor lock&quot; anyways? I've never heard this term 
defined in any context.
