--part1_139.dbacc63.2a046d8d_boundary

can you use por-15 on a non rusted area? to give it a nice shine, and to 
prevent rust. does it have to go on a rusted surface. because i was thinking 
of putting some on my wheel wells? but wasnt sure if i can use it for a non 
rusted area. well if anybody knows get back to me, thanks see ya
