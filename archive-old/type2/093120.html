Subject: Re: [T2] Leaky Valve Covers

Excessive crankcase pressure - crankcase vent plugged up?

Valve cover lip bent?

Tried to glue the valve cover to the valve cover AND the engine? It is be 
hell to get off but I bet it won't leak... &lt;grin!&gt;


&gt;Anyone have any ideas on a very leaky valve cover? Very Leakey! New gasket,
&gt;attempted to pull down after clip is in place, doesn't appear to be bent,
&gt;gasket is from reputable shop in town, I trust decent quality.
