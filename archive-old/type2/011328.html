it is said:

  &gt; _Real_ TSP is available and is the preferable material.

FWIW, large commercial greenhouses often have a washtub of TSP
in solution for a quick handwashing before touching the plants.
Kills tobacco mosaic virus, inter alia, which is not something
you want spreading in an acre of hothouse tomatoes, say.
