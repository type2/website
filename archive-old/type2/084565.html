Subject: Re: [T2] Temperature Gauge readings - Empirical data


Put a pot of water on the stove. With a thermometer, hold the temp to less=
=20
than 190=B0F. Note how fast the water evaporates. It just evaporates fastest=
=20
at 212=B0 from the boiling. Spill some water on a stone in the noon day sun.=
=20
Evaporates readily at much less than boiling point. If you get the oil temp=
=20
to 180=B0F, the volatiles (gas/water) will be driven off in 10 or 15 minutes=
=20
driving. Commuting less than 10 miles per day will load your oil very fast=
=20
with rich warmup mixture adding gas and condensation of water building up.=
=20
You must go back to the 60's Bentley to find the spec. under these=20
extremely stressful conditions, oil change interval is every 4 to 6 weeks,=
=20
regardless the milage. No matter how you use your T-II, if you maintain it=
=20
by inspection, rather than by time or milage, you will change your oil=20
before it begins to appear, feel or smell bad, ie, dirty to sight, gritty=20
to feel, or smelly of gas. If you see snot in the crankcase breather hose=20
and the oil fill cap, you have the too much short range driving situation.=
=20
It's empirical, this inspection based maintenance. Rules of thumb simply do=
=20
not apply. If you keep notes you can go back through them and determine=20
exactly the maintenance required for exactly the way you use your vehicle,=
=20
depending only on your ability to see, feel and smell, rather than guess=20
and accept that someone said every 3000 miles so that's what I do.

&gt;&gt;But, 212 obviously doesn't mean the water will boil off then, does it?
&gt;&gt;So, I am not sure of the validity of the original point that 212 is needed
&gt;&gt;to boil water out of the lubricating oil.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Or am I missing something?
&gt;
&gt;The oil is not *always* under pressure.  Sometimes it is in the crankcase.
