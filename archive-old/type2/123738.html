Subject: RE: [T2] roof rack for 78

I just hauled a canoe on my '78 bus from Cincinnati to Toledo
(with several additional stops)about 300mi using these:

Seeing the bow of the canoe above my rear view mirror and ropes front and
rear were my only real reminder of my roof bound boat....

Not to mention you cant beet the price!!!

Boat is still on the roof, do you want to see piks before I take it down????

  I've decided to finally get the canoe up off the roof of my van and put
it on a real rack.  now of the brands and models avaliable what gets you
high enough to fit over the hump in the roof without sitting waaaaay above
the roof, I would like it to just barely clear the roof if I can, don't
need tooo much wind turbulence up there.

thanks
Bob
