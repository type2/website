Subject: Re: Tapping rocker

&gt;I have just installed a new 1641 engine into my 71 bus.  The engine was
&gt;rebuilt from the original case using all new internal parts.  I am now
&gt;having an interesting problem with the #3 exhaust valve on the engine.
&gt;
&gt;I noticed that the valves were beginning to make a ticking noise.  Not to
&gt;unusual, I expected to have to adjust the valves shortly after installing
&gt;the engine.  When I got to the #3 exhuast valve, it was the only one that
&gt;was loose. I adjusted the valve and thought that all was fine.  Within 5
&gt;minutes, the valve began to tap again.  I checked the valve and sure enough
&gt;it was loose again.  All of the others were still just fine.  I adjusted the
&gt;valve again and again within 5 minutes of running it began to tap again.
&gt;
&gt;I have done this several times and each time the valve begins to tap again.
&gt;I thought that I was just not getting the adjuster tight and that it was
&gt;working its self loose but each time I would check the adjuster and it had
&gt;not moved and was still plenty tight.  
&gt;
&gt;I called the guy who built the motor for me and he told me that the push
&gt;rods are &quot;three piece&quot; push rods and that the push rod for valve might be
&gt;colapsing or might have a &quot;burr&quot; on the end of the push rod that could be
&gt;causing this problem.  What does this mean?  I thought that push rods were
&gt;solid. 
&gt;
&gt;If anyone out there has any suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it.  I
&gt;had to replace the last engine because of a burnt valve, I sure don't want
&gt;that to happen to this engine also.

  Yes they are three piece construction, at least most.

 There are two hardened ends pressed into an aluminum tube.

 It sounds from your description like the mechanic is on the right track.

 If it were the valve stretching it would be tightening up on you.

 That aluminum tube / hardened ends that we call the push rod has to
be straight. Any bend or bow is displacing the push force partly side 
ways. The more it bows the more of the push is deflected sideways.
 The vicious circle until it finally just collapses.

 If this happens, there will be no exhaust on #3. What kind of bad
things will happen, I don't know but it ought to be worse than a 
burnt valve. Like maybe a hole thru the piston.
 Hey that stuff has to go somewhere, right?

 The best plan is to pull the rocker assembly and then you can pull
the push rod for inspection.

 It should be absolutely straight and the shoulders of the hardened 
end caps should be flush with the cut ends of the tube.
