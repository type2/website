Subject: Re: [T2] How to remove horn button



&gt; Hi!
&gt; 
&gt; Can somebody tell me how to remove the horn button on a 71 bus?

Using a thin blade (like a dull table knife), pry the black inner button out of the silver metal ring.  Don't pry up on the metal ring, as it is 
screwed to the wheel!  To install, set the button in place and gently push the wire ring into the button while pushing the button into place.  
Work your way around and it'll drop into place.

George Lyle
