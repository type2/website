Subject: Re: [T2] Costa Mesa, California

I just spent a week out in Santa Ana and the bugs and buses were in
abundance.
I was not able to get to any shops or specific VW sites due to my schedule.
However, they were quite plentiful. It seemed like there was one on every
other corner.
As for sitings, I was told they were a dime a dozen.
That was true, the guys I was with told me they were sick of hearing &quot;Oh
man, check out that Bus/Bug!&quot;
2 buses of note:
    1 in Santa Ana was very clean with a very large Mercedes emblem on the
front.
    The other I saw was near Newport Beach. It was heading in the opposite
direction so I only got a quick look, but it was awesome. I think it was a
DC with a canvas type cover and drop down sides over the bed.
Enough of my ramblings and back to the 5 other buses and 5 bugs I see
regularly in Wilmington, NC.
Later,
