Subject: Re: [T2] type 4 case


Thanks for your detailed reply!
As long as I have had the engine, it hasnt had
any overheating problems.  Now, the thermostat had
been removed and the engine spent some time
in Minneapolis and South Dakota, which was probably
not too good for it, but thats all I
know (it was my first VW and
I didnt know what to ask about back then).

It has always felt strong and oil
temperatures, when I started measuring them, were
always around 180-190 degrees.  It never caused the
Gene Berg dipstick to turn on even on long hills out
here in the desert in the heat.
I had to pull the heads off for some sparkplug hole
inserts and a stripped exhaust stud, and just
thought I would keep going and check things out.

thanks again

&gt; &gt;I just split the case on my 2.0 l engine yesterday, expecting to
&gt; &gt;find much better news than I got when I split my type 3 case a couple
&gt; &gt;of weeks ago--but like the type 3, I
&gt; &gt;found the parts number from main bearing
&gt; &gt;#2 (?? the one that splits apart..)imprinted in the bore--
&gt; &gt;Does this mean that the case for sure needs align boring or can
&gt; &gt;it just be from oil discoloration?  I am beginning to think that
&gt; &gt;any case I split will look like this.  Also, could someone explain
&gt; &gt;to me what &quot;fretting&quot; actually looks like?  Do you see this on the
&gt; &gt;flat part of the case web or on the edges?  Is there a shop anyone
&gt; &gt;can recommend which will honestly assess what shape my case is in?
&gt; &gt;I don't want to align bore it if I can avoid it.
&gt;
&gt;You see it imprinted on any T4 case over 50k miles.  I doubt seriously
&gt;though they will even catch your fingernail if you scrape it.  Fretting on 
&gt;the
&gt;T4 case is sort of subtle you see it on the faces of the webs and it
&gt;starts where you no longer see the pattern of the grinding marks on
&gt;the faces around the main through bolt holes.  They initially are sort
&gt;of polished away and you will see the grinding marks adjacent in thin
&gt;strips where the other case half doesn't touch.  Then they become a
&gt;dull grey, and then the metal sort of gets rough.  In practicality as far
&gt;as I can tell this coresponds say to 75k, 115k, 150k miles respectively.
&gt;Over that the metal gets rougher and subtly &quot;balled up looking.&quot;  What
&gt;it means, well if you clean the case, put some cam bearings in and
&gt;while plastigaging the cam, go and torque the case down without anything
&gt;in the mains, chances are by about 100-125k you don't strictly meet the
&gt;by the book spec.  On the T4 usually because of out of round.  But it
&gt;won't be bad.  And as there is a lot of tolerance stack up between the
&gt;size of the case, the bearings, the crank, you can have some loss of
&gt;tolerances and still expect good life with good oil pressure.  If the
&gt;case looks to the bad end of what I described and oil pressure was
&gt;poor before tear down without extreme wear on the mains or rods
&gt;on inspection, and you think the pump was OK, or if the thing has over
&gt;200k on it, or if you know it is on its 3rd rebuild consider having it cut.
&gt;$40-$50 at Rimco, work will be superb.  Not so far from you.  Also
&gt;have the main galleys tapped for pipe plugs and the case pressure
&gt;washed.  Peen whatever galleys you don't have tapped with a center
&gt;punch in a circular pattern surrounding the factory aluminum plug but
&gt;you should also replace the small one behind the fan area with a 1/8
&gt;NPT plug.  If you know the thing is only on its 2nd rebuild or under 150k
&gt;miles and it didn't suffer a real hot horrible end you can probably go
&gt;ahead and rebuild it.  The T4 case isn't indestructable but it is pretty
&gt;darn tough.  Align bore T4 bearing sets are getting sort of pricey BTW.
