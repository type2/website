Subject: '72 rebuild sat for 3 yrs...what's it worth?

Howdy,

I'm looking at a motor that had the heads rebuilt 3
yrs back and the guy never came to pick it up.  the
shop has had it since.  they are reputable guys in the
bay area (ca).  figuring they would not have bothered
if the engine was not sound, would anyone like to
estimate a value to the motor sightunseen? and is
sitting for 3 years without oil in it a bad thing?  

Thanks,
Shawn
