No, the fuel filler neck in a '72-'79 bus is accessed through the round hatch
on the right side of the engine compartment where the computer is mounted, it
needs to be pryed off. It is a little difficult to work in there with the
computer still mounted, but I managed to do it just a few weeks ago. It was
not such a hard job.

&gt; The fuel filler neck is accessed by removing
&gt; the cover to the gas tank. IS this correct?
