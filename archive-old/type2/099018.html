&gt;I'd use 20A circuit breakers available at your FLAPS.  They connect with
&gt;spade terminals and should be placed back near the starter end of the
&gt;wires.  Otherwise use 20A AGC fuses in an in-line holder.  Get a well-made
&gt;holder, one that grips the fuse and is not just spring-loaded.  Good ones
&gt;come from Japanese cars and motorcycles or Radio Shack.

If there is one fuse per relay per headlight, why 20A?  A 55W bulb is drawing less than 5A at 12V.

Thanks to everyone.  I absorbed all the info and will collect the parts and plan a weekend project.
