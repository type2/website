&gt;Well, everything I say here is also opinion, but if that's not okay,

Of course.

&gt;I have to believe that, if you're trying to get max flow through the
&gt;head, and if two heads are identical other than I/O valve size, the
&gt;potential for moving air through the head will be greater for the head
&gt;with larger valves.

But what about shrouding?  Larger valves leave less room for the A/F charge 
to go around the valve into the cylinder.  My point is just that cylinder 
head design is very tricky business.  I think too many people assume that 
bigger is always better and fail to realize that there is a point of 
dimishing returns.  Who really knows where that point is?

&gt;That said, I can't testify that all other things
&gt;were equal between these two heads. Of course valve stem size, and
&gt;anything else along the airstream, can affect the speed or ease of the
&gt;flow, which relates to volume passing through. On the other hand,
&gt;because a thing is smaller doesn't necessarily mean it will disturb flow
&gt;less that a larger object that is more aerodynamic.

I agree with you, but I'm not sure what part you're referring to.  Do you 
mean that the larger valve stem is more aerodynamic than the smaller valve 
stem?

&gt;Re the Porche cam, as I recall it was no more significant than a mild
&gt;street performance VW aftermarket cam.

I have heard more than one person now say it is identical to the stock 
1.7/1.8 cam.  I've also heard that the 2.0 cam is very mild.  I wonder how 
a bus 2.0 with the 1.7/1.8 mechanical cam would run?  Anyone have this 
combination?

&gt;And I do remember that one big
&gt;thing with power builders was getting rid of the potential for valve
&gt;&lt;float&gt; at high rpms through use of stiffer valve springs, especially
&gt;with steeper and taller cams. Personally I opted for a moderate increase
&gt;of horsepower with ease of maintenance and good driveability.

That's what I'm after as well.  I don't want to turn more than 5k rpm or 
have a really radical cam that requires stiffer valve springs.  The cam has 
enough problems with premature wear as it is.  Now what I would REALLY like 
is a roller valvetrain conversion - anyone have any ideas?  :)
