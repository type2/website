Ive used doorskins instead of 1/4&quot; plywood with better results.
They are thinner. Like 1/8&quot;. so they bend and mount easier and look better.
They have a finished side comparable to expensive finish grade plywood.
They are even cheaper then plywood.
They are smaller and less bulky to bring home than 4x8 sheets.
And with several coats of polyurethane they look mahvelous.
