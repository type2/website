Subject: RE: [T2] front nose section

&gt; Does any one know who makes front aftermarket nose sections - 
&gt; I expect that some come from Brazil - but how bout Denmark?  
&gt; Anyone know what gage metal VW used on body panels in the 
&gt; past?  How bout today? How bout after market repair panels?  
&gt; I called Bus Depot and they tell me that the sections come 
&gt; from California - what does that mean - made in CA? or ....


Sorry, sounds like a lack of communication. The nose SHIPS from
California. But it's MADE in Brazil. You asked where they came from,
meaning originally, and he apparantly misunderstood the question (duh
:-) and told you where they ship from.  

Klokkerholm/Denmark does sell a nose, and periodically you'll see it
listed at other vendors as being &quot;made in Denmark.&quot; Unfortunately, it's
the same Brazilian nose, just imported and rebranded by Klokkerholm You
pay more because you bought your new bus nose a European vacation,
paying to have it shipped from Brazil to Denmark to the United States.
Save your money and use it for your own European vacation. :-) 

As for the gauge specs, I'm afraid I have no info on that.
