I too installed an oil temp gage and had great difficulty getting the sensor
to seal properly to the sump plate.  I finally ended up fabricating a new
sump plate out of alum and mounted the sensor to this plate - and no more
leaks!  I have found the oil temp to run a max. of 180F in the &quot;winter&quot;
months here in the SF bay area (ambient temps 40F coldest).  It is possible
that the oil temp is really ~130F if the outside temp is in the 30&quot;s and you
have only driven for ~15 min (see what happens in 30 min).  I also installed
a cylinder head temp gage (from a wrecked VW GTI) and get readings of
anything from 80C to 120C depending upon the engine loading (i.e. up or down
hill) while the oil temp gage stays constant _at_ ~180F.  This shows that the
oil cooler is doing it's job.  Good luck with the oil leak (the sump plate
may be warped from the welding process- if so try and get a replacement from
the junk yard).

&gt; Shouldn't the temp rise faster than that?  BTW, I'm at 5400 feet above
&gt; sea level and it was probably 35 degrees F or so outside.  Assuming the
&gt; gauge is calibrated and wired correctly, that leaves the temp sender.  I
&gt; really don't know much about the sender, except it was supposed to be
&gt; the correct one.  I installed the sender in the oil sump plate on my 78
&gt; 2.0L engine.  Actually, I had the FLAPS install the sender, as they had
&gt; to weld the nut onto the inside of the sump plate.  Apparently the weld
&gt; is pretty pourous, as oil leaks out around the sender and spreads onto
&gt; the female connector.  Could this be a problem?
&gt;
&gt; I'd appreciate any comments on my predicament.  Thanks-
