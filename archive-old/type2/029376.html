About the high cost of Q-pads to reduce
high frequency road noise:

Other items that will work really well are:
(All tried on my old '72 bug as a 'fix' for
a nasty muffler leak)
Cheap rubber welcome mats. ($2 each at dollar store)
Closed cell foam sleeping pads. ($10 each for long)
'Yarn' carpet pad. ($1.75 sq yd). Roll with latex house
paint and stick aluminum foil to the paint. Worked
the best but was the hardest to set up. Add $5 for
the cost of the aluminum foil. Only did one side.
I never tried the spray foam, but spraying on a snake
and spreading with a trowel ought to do some good.

For all of the things, make sure that you paint with
regular paint first, then the 'padding' then the
cool patch. Only the first coat of paint will work
to keep the metal rust free, as most of the adhesives
have some kind of acid in them (usually mild) that
may cause rusting if applied to bare metal.

On the same subject, I used exterior latext paint
and painted the backside of all of the cardboard 
door panels and stuff. It cut down on any kind of 
water damage from leaking windows. (I know, fix it right....)

Now is the time to do this kind of work while it is
warm and sunny, not cold and snowy!
