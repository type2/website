Subject: mcodes

Having recently acquired a scanner, I was putzing around with my OCR 
software.  I have a repop of an early parts list, and tried scanning the 
mcodes page, as a lark.  I noticed that there are some codes on my list 
that you don't have.  I'm including the list, although it will need some 
editing.  A lot of these you already have, but with slightly different 
text.  These are from the proverbial horses mouth.  I especially like 
M196, which I actually have...

The photocopy I have is not that great, which is why some editing is 
necessary...
