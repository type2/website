On Monday my beloved bus was terminally damaged on the
way home from a vacation and is now a parts donor. I
can't stand being busless and have begun looking for
another one. I am looking for a driver in good
condition and can travel for the right one. Any year
considered. Please p-mail me with any leads.

TIA,
Seth
