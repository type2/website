Subject: Re: [T2] Stupid Mistake? Follow up found rods upside down!!!!


&gt;While it is a good habit to aquire  ( installing rods with the mark up ),
&gt;i believe your engine's rods would work the way you installed them.
&gt;I can't find the source, but i believe these type 1 rods are concentric
&gt;and work the same either way.

Examine the small pin end of the type 1 rod and you will see
it is offset to locate the pin because rod journal and bore centers
aren't lined up as designed. Hence, there is only one correct
orientation.
