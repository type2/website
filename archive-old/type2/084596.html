&gt;Persona observations, and engine longevity is proof of the pudding, Mr.
&gt;Tim----

I disagree. You have no evidence at all that the snakeoyl had anything to 
do with longevity. You just assume it so so you can think yourself wise for 
spending the money on snakeoyl.

&gt;The &quot;data&quot; plea seems to arise whenever the cat has got your tongue---(
&gt;here I go with the cat thing---)

Most on this list will testify that I am rarely if every tongue tied. Wrong 
again.


&gt;Molecular analysis isn't needed here Tim--just plain common sense and
&gt;pure longevity figure's in this instance are adequate---

Don't need facts so don't need to listen to those with the most facts in 
hand, the engineers who designed and manufactured the vehicle. So good to 
know we have someone on the list to testify his subjective experiences have 
more weight than the factory.


&gt;Throwing data figure's is like pissing in the wind, if an actual real
&gt;world experience, isn't appreciated.

No problem with anyone giving testimony of their experiences and 
conclusions based upon subjective observations. It just can't replace real 
data in a rational sence.


&gt;If you interested in mileage figure's, and zero down time due to lack
&gt;engine failure's, attributed to the use of Marvel Mystery Oil, I have
&gt;plenty----
&gt;
&gt;As I stated in my prior posting, I have been a believer, and user of
&gt;Marvel Mystery Oil for at least 35 year's, and never have had any lifter
&gt;failure, stuck rings, galling or excessive valve stem, or guide failure,
&gt;nor not one pounded out bearing in any engine I have ever owned---

Others who maintain their engines spec with no snakeoyl at all can testify 
to the same great service. This would seem to back up the factory advise as 
at least equivalent to your assumed beliefs.


&gt;And I am a pedal to the metal kind of guy----not a tea totalling, stick
&gt;at 60 mph, mope---- life in the express lane is the way I drive---

I know, you believe you are invincible.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The stuff works for me--and I'm happy I found it many moon's ago--it has
&gt;saved me money, aggravation, and down time.

You believe it works for you, you don't know it works for you. There is a 
big difference that you will never understand unless and until you develop 
rational thought.


&gt;And for that I'm happy, and I will continue appreciating the benefits of
&gt;it's fine lubricating qualities  ----

Sell it to Marvel. They gladly accept unsolicited testamonials.


&gt;This is not in any way shape or form a infomercial, by Ron Popeal,or
&gt;Dion Warwick--it is my own personal findings, using this product, for
&gt;long period of time---with superior results--that all.

This is what you have said repeatedly to convince yourself that facts are 
inferior to belief. This is the tech of claims and testimonials. Repeat 
over and over until someone else believes it and you become validated in 
your own personal reality.


&gt;Please take a moment to read the side of the can of Marvel--it's
&gt;interesting and informative--

Sold you so it must be very convincing.
