Subject: Re: [T2] Goodbye am radio.

Since it's Friday....

There is one RS I won't go into anymore. I went in to buy something, they
didnt have it, so I thought I would go ahead and get some replacement
batteries so I didnt have to make another stop. I'm holding a $5 bill
in my hand. The clerk/jerk/manager asks for my phone number.

Me:  &quot;It's unlisted.&quot;
Her: &quot;Could I have your address?&quot;
Me:  &quot;Why do you need my address for a cash transaction?&quot;
Her: &quot;Our computer system is down and we just need that information for
      receipt purposes in case you need to make a return.&quot;
Me:  &quot;Why do you need my address for a cash transaction?&quot;
Her: &quot;Sir, we just need that information.&quot;
Me:  &quot;Ok. 123 ANY STREET&quot;
Her: &quot;Sir, we need your REAL address.&quot;
Me:  &quot;That IS my real address.&quot;
Her: &quot;No, it's not.&quot;
Me:  &quot;You know, I can get these batteries and Wal-Mart for cheaper and
      THEY don't need to know my address!&quot;
Her: &quot;Well, I suggest you go to Wal-Mart then.&quot;
Me:  &quot;Fine!&quot;

And I left the batteries on the counter and walked out.
The batteries were a LOT cheaper at Wal-Mart too.
Unbelievable that they turned down a CASH sale over an address.

Bus content: I removed my barely working tape deck in my bus.
             I'm going to use the opening for more gauges in
             the future. The next nice radio I install, I will
             mount in my glove box so it is out of sight. I dont
             remember where I was someone do that, but I liked
             the idea. Most theives wont want what they cant see.
