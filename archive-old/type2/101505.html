&gt; My wife and I hope to be arriving in Lake Havasu City this weekend in
our 72 Westy (&quot;Poppy&quot;) after driving from Vancouver to the tip of Baja
Mexico (where we are now) then up to AZ.  After BBB we will be heading
down to mainland Mexico via Tuscon.
&gt;
&gt; The roads in Baja have dirtied/shaken things up a bit and we need some
basic maintenance done (oil change, valves adjusted, filters changed,
suspension checked etc).
&gt;
&gt; Can someone recommend a good shop in AZ to take our bus to on Monday

Well, there's a shop in Havasu called the Old Volks Home...

Give them a call as soon as you get in.  The proprieter might be a wee bit
busy this week :)
