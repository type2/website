Well, I just happened to be reading a big 'Rolling Stones&quot; book on Jerry 
Garcia's life .  I never knew but two songs of the Dead prior to buying my 
'76 Deluxe two years ago, and figured I'd better get a clue being that I 
'fit' the picture of a Dead head.  Anyways, the significance of the number 9, 
is the number of fingers Jerry had, being he lost the tip of his middle 
finger on his hand as a child, while chopping firewood.   There's my guess... 
 

Peace!
