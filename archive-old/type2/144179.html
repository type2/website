Subject: Re: [T2] Westy pop-top ceiling fuzz?

Jeremy -

Here's a fuzz update - you said:

&gt; Do not try to just paint it it will
&gt;  turn into a rough sandpaper like 
&gt; surface that will scrape your elbows 
&gt; and knees trust me I have the scars to prove it.

Sage advice indeed. I tried following Richard Atwell's
advice (thanks for the response, Richard) - wetting
the stuff and scraping it off (tried both water and
solvent), but it remains unblemished (if only they'd
used this stuff to line the battery tray ;-). 

So, since you've painted yours, can you tell me if
this would work:

1) I paint it, and let it dry and harden
2) I sand the now-hardened fibers off, to give a
smooth surface, then repaint?

Did your paint get all the way to the fiber roots? Do
you think it would be feasible to sand them off?  And
more importantly - what kind of paint did you use?
Interior house paint? 

Thanks in advance

M
