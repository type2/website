Subject: FS: Refurbished Type IV Case and Kolbenschmidt OEM Main
  Bearings

I am selling a refurbished air-cooled aluminum VW type IV engine case
that came from an 82 Vanagon. This will fit a 914, type 2 Bus or
Vanagon. This case is suitable for rebuild of a any type IV motor or as
a replacement for a Type I engine. Build a stroker motor and get the
performance of an aluminum case (with bearings) for less than a new full
flow type I case. In addition I am supplying a new set of Kolbenschmidt
main bearings for this case. The bearings are very hard to find and
usually cost $125. To get a similar case from AVP is $275. Total value
is $400.
