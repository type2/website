&gt; It's just like before -- once she's going, she seems to run fine on the open 
&gt; road, but as soon as the speed and the idle drop, she stalls.

&gt; When I got home this evening, I pulled the distributor and here's what I found:
&gt; 
&gt; a) The cap had fine metal shavings in it
&gt; b) The top of the rotor looked pretty funky
&gt; c) When I pulled the distributor out, I heard something fall out of it, but 
&gt; when I dug around on top of the engine I just came up with some charred bits,
&gt;   no metal, nothing like a screw or anything
&gt; d) The points gap was tight and the contact point was icky (a very small point,
&gt;   not as bad as I've seen the points fried before)
&gt; 
&gt; I replaced and regapped the points, cleaned up the contact points on the rotor 
&gt; with an emery board (it still had a black dot in the center), did the same 

probably not your problem but one thing to realize, emery boards use a
metalic grit and should not be used to file electrical components (most
but not all emery boards)

&gt; to the center point inside the cap (which is not stationary but &quot;floats,&quot; which 
&gt; surprised me), put it all back together, and checked the dwell (right on, IN 

have you checked the rotor shaft bearing, if it is loose and wobbles it
could cause some of these problems.

&gt; Mr. Dolan is convinced it's something to do with vacuum, since it was borderline 
&gt; low when he checked it back in Georgia. That stuff is all Greek to me, but 
&gt; I traced all the hoses as best I could, checked the brake booster line, and 
&gt; couldn't find anything loose, unplugged, or cracked. However, I know enough 
&gt; to fear that hissing noise I hear in the engine compartment.

hissing noise is clue, try listening with a hose, or if you have a
stehascope pull off the end and put a small piece of tubing in the tube
and use that as a probe to track down the hiss (or any other sound)

&gt; Oh, and The Spark Plug Wire Test at the distributor indicates that the right 
&gt; side is not pulling its weight, but I do have spark jumping the gap from the 
&gt; wire to the distributor on those two wires. When I pull 3 and 4, the engine 
&gt; falters; not so with 1 and 2.

big clue, problem is on the 1/2 side of the engine.  

. getting spark to plugs?
. valve lash has slipped
. loose or leaky carb
. find that hiss

&gt; Yrgh. Any ideas? I'm supposed to be in L.A. at 8:30 tomorrow morning, and 
&gt; I'll hear no end of grief for being late (I wish I had a dollar for every 

burn the midnight oil, this sounds like one of those &quot;AH HA&quot; problems, 5
hours to find, 5 minutes to fix

good luck, BTDT
