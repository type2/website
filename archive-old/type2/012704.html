Sean:
A fully charged lead-acid battery should be between 13.2V and 13.8V with no load on it.  That's why the charging voltage on most cars is over 14 volts.  If it measures less than 13V with what should be a full charge in it, then it's on its last legs.  Also, make sure your battery charger is good.

&gt;Hey guys,
&gt;Got a battery question for you all.  I have an Interstate deep cycle battery
&gt;that I've been having trouble with, doesn't seem to like to hold a charge.
&gt;
&gt;I filled up the cells w/ water, put it on the battery charger and left it
&gt;until the charge scale went down to 0 amps.  I put a voltmeter on it and
&gt;found a reading of 12.5v.  So far so good.  However, when I use my little
&gt;specific gravity meter (one of those droppers with the four floating balls
&gt;in it), in two cells I get one floating ball (4 is full charge).  So I get
&gt;one floating ball in 2 different cells, however in the other 4 cells, NONE
&gt;of the balls float.
