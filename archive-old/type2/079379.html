Subject: RE: [T2] Ignition switch removal-Ugly Way

[...]

While reading and clearing out old List mail, I finally realized why
there is a hole in the ignition key housing on my 71 opposite the one
for the cable on the right side.  This must be the quick and dirty
way that one of the previous owners of my bus changed the ignition
lock.

Drilled a hole through the housing just behind the lock.  Used
something like an old bicycle wheel spoke to pop the release pin.  No
grinding off the face of the lock.  No major disassembly.  Just an
ugly 1/4 inch hole.

&gt;Dave,
&gt;
&gt;The '68 is not the same as the '71. To remove the 68 is easy. Remove 
&gt;the
&gt;shear pine from the slit and push a pin in wiggle and slide the lock
&gt;cylinder out. If my memory serves me correctly the 71 is a whole 
&gt;different
&gt;ball game in that the pin is not accessible. here is what we do. 
&gt;remove the
&gt;hidden screws in the housing ( deep inside the wholes for mounting 
&gt;the
&gt;housing to the body) Then the trick is to grind or shave the face of 
&gt;the
&gt;lock cylinder off and then the cylinder housing will slid off 
&gt;exposing the
&gt;pin. Remove the now trashed lock cylinder and replace it. ($30-$35). 
&gt;I hope
&gt;this helps. FYI we sell used housings and cylinders for $75.00 (you 
&gt;just
&gt;slide it onto the column and that's that. We also have all the parts
&gt;individually.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Hi list!
&gt;
&gt;I have been attempting to remove an ignition switch from a 71 bus in
&gt;order to use it on a 68.  They appear to be identical - does anybody
&gt;know for sure?
&gt;
&gt;I successfully removed the steering wheel and pulled the entire
&gt;steering column sleeve that has the ignition switch housing, but I
&gt;still can't get the switch itself out.
&gt;
&gt;Does anybody know the trick?
&gt;
&gt;TIA
&gt;
