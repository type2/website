&gt; &gt; Yes, GR17X is for the 69-71 bus and is longer. it takes the concave
backing
&gt; &gt; plate to properly install it so that the fan belt runs in the correct
plane with
&gt; &gt; the crank pulley.
&gt;
&gt; AND it takes a special cast iron generator pulley, they tend to break and
&gt; are unavialable new.

&gt;Y'know, I have this generator in my '71.  Yes, it has the dished backing
&gt;plate.  However, it has a normal-looking stamped pulley, which, AFAIK, is
&gt;stock. I also put a bus generator in my wife's bug, with the correct
backing plate and her
&gt;original bug pulley.  In both cases, the alignment has been just fine and
&gt;I've had no belt problems.

I've had mixed results. I noticed the cast iron pulley on a couple of old
generators but never knew they were integral to the 69-71 setup.Also the
900mm belt is a bit more difficult to find on the east coast at the various
FLAPS. Unwittingly I've used the cheap pulley on the 69-71 generator and
run into problems - but not as serious as using the wrong backing plate.
Using the wrong backing plate has been a definite no-no for me.
I had to change the backing plate on the side of the highway because of it.
The moral of the
story is: spread out a rag and examine all your parts. Ask yourself - does
this go with this? Where did this come from? What size belt does this take?
Study &amp; research and make
lists before mis-assembling  - it's better than being heckled at a rest
stop in the middle of the night with the motor out.
