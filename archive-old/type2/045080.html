Subject: Re: [T2] Flowers For Kristin Laurite

Charlie,


i will gladly contribute to any fund you may have for those flowers. The 
tragedy touched so many of us, it would be nice to participate a bit and you 
don't have to feel like you need to foot the bill for all of us. (Alhough it 
is much appreciated)
Anyway, I'll be glad to contribute toward it. 

Melissa
