&gt; Was said...&quot;I still find it hard to believe that anyone has ever gotten more
&gt; than $10,000 for baywindow (exclusive of singlecabs and doublecabs).&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Now I am probably setting myself up here, but my point or rather my thoughts
&gt; Now I want to keep this fun...I am not looking to get beat up over adding the
&gt; hightop or how ugly it is. Let's just assume it was on the market. What would
&gt; the list say is a price you would expect to see it sell or be listed for?
&gt;
that's easy $5,000.00  all buses are worth 5k  if you pay more you lose
money until it is 5k if you pay less you spend until it reaches 5k

&gt; Once we do mine let's do some others!!

not a chance...my insurance agent might see it and I have an assigned
value policy, mine's worth $8,500!  and I'm sticking to it
