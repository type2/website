&gt; &gt; &gt; Problem with starting after the engine has only
&gt; &gt; been
&gt; &gt; &gt; off for a minute or so.  I remember this being
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I phutzed with this problem for years and finally
&gt; &gt; threw in the towel and
&gt; &gt; put a relay in, have not had any problems since
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am also contemplating going to a breakerless
&gt; &gt; &gt; ignition, something along the lines of a petronix
&gt; &gt; or
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; stock though.  Anybody use a breakerless module
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; would like to comment?  Also, I have perused the
&gt; &gt; 'net
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have a Pertronix in my 78 and have had it for a
&gt; &gt; couple years now, I like
&gt; &gt; it.
