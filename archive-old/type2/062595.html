&gt;Is this perhaps a symptom of the problem that is fixed by bending the needle

&gt;idle and very seldom at that. If it matters, this happens to be an automatic.

&gt;Thanks for any ideas; this is a little disconcerting.

Weston, as I remember there was an extensive discussion of this problem and
its relation to loose and/or dirty contacts in the engine electrical
harness, connections etc., on the Vanagon list before it split and the Type2
list was formed. Check the vanagon_at_lenti message archives at:

My '81 hesitates ever-so-slightly once in a while, but a little cleaning and
straightening of electrical system contacts seems to have reduced it to so
minor a problem that I stopped looking for the cause--I just live with a
split-second cut-out every now-and-then. 

But, it sounds like your problems is more seriously perplexing than mine
was, so I recommend checking the archives, and cleaning and tightening or
straightening any and all contacts in the electrical system, BUT PLEASE, do
it with the battery disconnected so as to protect expensive electrical
components!! (From one who learned the hard way!) Contacts cleaned and
primped, you can go on to search for other problems if the condition
persists with confidence that the &quot;loose contact scourge&quot; is not what's
bugging you. 

Best of luck,
