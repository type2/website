&gt;I'd take another look at the vehicle code in California, especially as it
&gt;relates to the smog emission, registration, &quot;lemon law&quot;. As I understand
&gt;it (and I will double check), the owner (seller) of a vehicle cannot sell
&gt;a vehicle of which he/she has knowledge of a modified or non-working
&gt;exhaust system, or whose smog test was obtained by illegal (immoral and
&gt;unethical, I might add) means. For a vehicle sold in California, my
&gt;understanding is the seller may be held responsible for any post-sale
&gt;repair costs that the buyer incurs to get the vehicle smogged. My
&gt;impression is that this law is to discourage persons from selling cars in
&gt;California that for the most part are not smogable ... especially if the
&gt;seller has this knowledge and does not inform the buyer. If the seller
&gt;fails to ascertain smogability, he is just as guilty as if he knew
&gt;before hand the vehicle wasn't smogable.

        Right. I'm not arguing legality or ethics here, I'm stating
options. LEGALLY, the seller must provide somg. Period. My point is that
many cars are indeed sold every day in CA *without* smog, and the buyer is
the party responsible for smogging it. This is agreed upon and understood
prior to the sale. I suppose in theory someone could be a dick, but in
reality the guy getting the good deal is usually happy with just that. I
was quite happy when I got my bus for $150 from the impound yard, and they
didn't give me a smog. I never even *considered* legal action. The 16 year
old kid-or the 40ish geezer-getting the new bus will likely be happy to
make the score, and deal with smog themselves. People who want a one piece
package generally buy a new Chrysler, not an old bus.

        As for ethics, check some old threads about new car manufacture
pollution vs. old car usage and you'll find how I feel about BS smog laws.

Peace,
