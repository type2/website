&gt; Since I have no electrical part available for now, I'm going to just put
&gt; it back the way it was for now and hot wire it in the engine compartment.

Just unplug the harness from the keyswitch and temporarily wire in a
toggle/pushbutton up front. If there are old bus parts lying about then
scavenge the part of the harness that wires to the keyswitch to make life
easier. Otherwise you have to carefully plug in a few individual spade
connectors to the bus-side of your harness to avoid having to
&quot;clip-and-splice&quot;.

Toggle gives you &quot;on/acc&quot; and pushbutton for &quot;start&quot;. My '69 beetle only
had keys for the doors from the day I got it over 10 years ago. Turn
signals/hazards, ignition, and headlight dimmer are all switches mounted to
a panel under the dash.
