Subject: Re: Whirring noise in back

Hello all, 
Well, I found the source of the noise. It was the fuel pump. Imagine that? 
Now for the real questions
1. should it run with the key in ACC

2. is this original equipment? 
(cant find it in my manual but then again I never heard of a CLYMER shop 
manual)

3.and the $64 question do I need it?

Bear in mind that the engine is '76 2.0L w/a webber 2bbl carburetor (don't 
know how to tell what flavor carb it is)

Any help would be appreciated.

P.S. I almost have the &quot;financial director&quot; convinced I need a Haynes manual
