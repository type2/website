Subject: ADMIN AGAIN:  Re: [T2] virus

Once again,
Your message must be about VW Buses in order for you to post it to the list.

Not only does this prohibit virus warnings but it also prohibits e-mails
about how to configure Outlook Express.

If you have a question about how the list is run, or problems you may be
having with e-mail, or questions about how to set up your e-mail client
software, please feel free to direct those questions to one of the list
administrators.

Here are the contact addresses for the admins.  You may want to save these:

George Lyle:  physicshelp_at_rocketmail_dot_com
David Schwarze:  schwarze_at_mail.ev1_dot_net
Matt Roberds:  mattroberds_at_home_dot_com
Sean Bartnik:  seabar_at_rcn_dot_com

We will be happy to address any questions but please don't send non-Bus
questions to the list, they are off-topic.

Thank you,

Sean Bartnik
Type2 List Administrator
Springfield, MA
