&gt;I wonder if an ordinary Delco alternator would fit in that spot?  I'm not
&gt;familiar with the type IV, but if a Delco alterntor would fit you would
&gt;get plenty of amps, self-cooling, and easy parts availability.

It would need to be a sealed case alternator with a port on the rear for 
air intake and exhausting through the front (of the alternator, not the 
bus).  No fan - the air is supplied by the engine fan via the fan 
housing.  Does the Delco fit this description?

Most alternators that I know of are cooled from the front to the rear, with 
either an external or internal fan.  These types of alternators will not 
work in a type 4 baywindow application, at least not for long.  I sure wish 
it were otherwise but the type 4 application is unusual.
