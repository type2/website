&gt; Cool! I am glad to hear about that. Without catching to much back lash from
&gt; the purists, I have always thought that solid state, digital technology far
&gt; superior than rubbing to sticks together...Glad to hear that the install is
&gt; easy. Where did you purchase yours from?
&gt; 
&gt; Thank You,

I don't know where you are located, if you're on the east coast,
call Ron at Bus Depot:  215 234 8989

But if you're closer to the west, give Ronnie in Lake Havasu AZ. a call
at Old Volks Home: 520 680 7664.

Both guys are on this list and are really nice to deal with and I bet their
prices are very close to the same.
