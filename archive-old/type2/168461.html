Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Popped valve seat picture

Thx Mark, the welding is aluminum to aluminum only to restore the 
shape of the seat area, prior to machinging to accept a new steel 
seat, pressed in place. It had been gouged and pounded when the 
seat popped and wedged itself under the valve.  I'll talk to my 
man about the peening.  
GG

hey GG what we do is press in a larger seat and then grind it to fit the VW  valve. My machinist has been doing these for over 25 years and is very good at it. I really don't like the welding idea much either as you are welding two different metaLS TOGETHER  LATER  MD
