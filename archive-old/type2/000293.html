Can anyone tell me how to duplicate the finish in a 71 Westy? I have the
birch plywood panels all cut and sanded but I can't figure out how to match
the finish on the old panels. The stains I found are either to white or too
yellow. Any help would be appreciated as this is the last thing I have to do
before putting the bus all back together so I can go play. Any help would be
greatly appreciated. TBear

Don't take life too seriously- you'll never live through it.
