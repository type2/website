Subject: Re: [T2] re:Snake oil cooling info???

If you want Aluminum valve covers, just go get them.
If you engine is running so hot that 3 to 5 degrees is important consider
an oil cooler.
The valve covers don't have their own heat source all they can do is
reduce the temperature of the oil that happens to get on them before it
drains back into the oil pan.
I think aluminum valve covers look good, I wouldn't hesitate to throw
$39.95 at a pair. I'd just be buying them for appearance and expecting
nothing from them in return.

&gt; &gt;Any thoughts on this?

&gt; 
&gt; What I remember reading/hearing about the subject of
&gt; shiney aluminum valve covers is that they lead to
&gt; higher oil temperatures as the do not cool the oil
&gt; that splatters into them like the black stock ones do.
&gt;  There is often a problem getting them to fit tightly,
&gt; too, especially if they are held on by studs and nus
&gt; rather than wire bails.  
&gt; Sounds like something I may have read in the Idiot
&gt; Book years ago.
