Hi Mark -

&gt; are you doing both heads? or just one

Just one (RHS - #1 &amp; #2), since I'm under a time
constraint for leaving on vacation

&gt; if I remember correctly the AMC heads dont 
&gt; use the head gasket

hmmm.... how would I find out for sure? The AMC heads

I have on ther did have the head gasket, and the Tom
Wilson book says use the gasket for all Type 4
engines.

If it turns out they do require the gasket, does that
mean no lapping the cyls/heads is necessary? I'd like
to avoid lapping if possible, since i'd have to remove
the cylinders (the motor's still in the van, and I
left the cylinders on for now), which would mean
replacing them again afterwards, and probably breaking
a ring in the process, knowing my luck ;-)

cheers
