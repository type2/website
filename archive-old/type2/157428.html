Subject: Re: [T2] gas theft

Can you picture somebody attempting to syphon fuel
from a bus? That hose must've been mighty long and the
thief mighty patient, especially if it was already
getting low! Did you go looking for your cap? -BaH

&gt; Well, I was perfectly happy with my non-locking
&gt; original gas cap -  until last night.  I went to
&gt; dinner kind of late with a professor  friend of
&gt; mine.  Parked across the lot from the place.  It's 
&gt; just about 1/4 mile from my house.  This morning I
&gt; noticed that  the gas guage didn't work.  Well below
&gt; the empty mark.  The  bus was almost empty anyhow
&gt; but I made it to the gas station where I  noticed
&gt; that my gas cap was missing.  It has been over a
&gt; week  since I filled up and I'm confident I would
&gt; have noticed it.  My  guage reads 1/2 full when it's
&gt; full.  So I always fill up when I  hit the empty
&gt; mark.  Yesterday I was near that mark and planned on
&gt;  filling up today anyhow.  Well, my tank took 14
&gt; gallons!   I've never been able to put more than 12
&gt; in it on the empty mark.
