&gt;Spacer? There wasn't one! Is it paper or metal?

Metal.  It's got five holes, one in the middle, three for the bolts and
one for the locating pin between two of the bolts.  It's round, and
I'd guesstimate it as ~1mm thick.  I'm guesstimating 'cuz mine
is on the bus and I ain't taking it apart!  Someone knows for sure
how thick it is.
