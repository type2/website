Mineral King Valley roads end, (7800') after about 4 hours on the road.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Volks,
&gt; &gt; 2 weeks ago I conquered Old Fort Mountain on I-40 in NC in my 81
&gt; &gt; vanagon............looked for a t-shirt stand at the top and definitely
felt
&gt; &gt; like some sort of gold star should now be worn on my cap!  Took at at 45
MPH
&gt; &gt; in 3rd gear...........7 mile 6 % grade.............
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I thought Saluda grade was bad on I-26 ( about a 3 mile 6 % grade) but
Old
&gt; &gt; Fort puts it to shame!!!
&gt;
&gt; We've got to get you out to the Left Coast where you can climb some real
mountains!  How about US 395 between Bishop and Carson
&gt; City in the Sierras?  Start at Bishop, elevation 4100 feet.  In the next
15 miles, climb to Sherwin Summit (7000).  About 30 miles later you
&gt; get to Deadman Summit (8041).  30 more miles gets you to Conway Summit
(8138) and another 20 to Devil's Gate Summit (7519).  From
&gt; there you drop into Gardnerville at 4700 feet.  Typically, my stock 1600DP
bus (low compression Mexican engine) will maintain 30-35MPH
&gt; on the 6%+ grades on this route.  With the thin air, I doubt that it's
making much more than 30HP.  The scenery is so pretty that the slow
&gt; speeds aren't a bother.
&gt;
&gt; Another route for hill-climbers is from Badwater (280 feet _below_ sea
level) to Emigrant Pass (5318 feet) in Death Valley.  This route is
&gt; about 50 miles and the temperatures can be a tad warm.
&gt;
&gt; I still think that the worst climb I've done is the western approach to
Jerome.  That road is literally carved out of a cliff.
