Subject: Re: Air Cooled Vanagon Won't Start in cold weather

[...]

Did I screw something up (see attached post)? I was cranking 
the starter for WAY too long. I tried the van today, and it 
wouldn't turn over at all... I turned the key and I just got 
a click. Its not the battery... the interior lights are 
bright but just to be sure I hooked it up to my running car 
to no avail.

Not to prejudice your responses but I have one of those WR1 
relay kits and I am wondering if I blew the fuse in it.... 
Has anyone replaced one of these? How do I test it?

Thanks,
Chris

Here in Toronto it is -4C or -10C with the wind chill, I am 
not sure what that is in degrees F but trust me its cold. I 
have been having this problem for a while and today it 
finally gave up. 

I can hear the van turning over but it doesn't &quot;catch&quot;. If I 
keep my foot on the throttle and keek the key turned to 
start the engine almost, but doesn't quite, start. When it 
was slightly warmer the same thing was happening but it 
would eventually start.
