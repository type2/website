Subject: Re: [T2] Dwell Meter and Timing Ligth

&gt; &gt; JFUD4
&gt; &gt; BOSCH 0 231 168 015
&gt; &gt; VW 043 905 205L
&gt;
&gt; This dist is not listed on Jim Thompson's site. but a &quot;111 905 205L&quot; is
&gt; listed and I would guess is the same dist for the US (and bug) market.
&gt; It is listed as being for a 1965 40HP beetle.  The timing for that dist is
&gt; listed as &quot;10deg BTDC Static or _at_ 800-950rpm w/strobe w/vacuum hose

111 905 205L also listed for 1500 Bus 64-65.
