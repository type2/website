Subject: I agree report &quot;bad apples&quot;

I have to agree that reporting bad apples is a good idea. List members are 
always supporting one another and maintaining the hobby. Jerks who are not 
honorable when doing business should be reported to the list. They are no 
different than the bastards stealing parts off your bus in the middle of the 
night. Theives are theives and I think it's best that we identify them for 
one another.

I recently traded some parts with a list member and had a very positive 
experience. (Thanks Dan Evans) We just sent the parts we agreed to send and 
didn't hassle about anything.  It was a nice feeling and I want to be part 
of a group that supports that kind of ethic.

Just my 2 cents.
