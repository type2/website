Subject: timing a hybrid engine...

I've got an updated and remanufactured/rebuilt 1967
engine in my '68 bus that apparently also has had
swapped in a newer vacuum distributor, carb and a
one-notch crankshaft pulley.

According to my distributor no. and the chart in the
Type 2 archives, the DISTRIBUTOR should be timed to
zeroTDC with the vac line plugged.

So far, so good.

But when I checked the timing, it was somewhere before
TDC, because there's no extra notches, I estimate
about 7.5 degrees. The bus ran well and cool.

And when I tuned it up recently, it seemed to run best
at this estimated 7.5.

I'm confused. Is there a way to figure the correct
timing when the book data doesn't make sense?
