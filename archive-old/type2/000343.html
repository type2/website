My addiction got the better of me. I have been driving a '89 Fox while my
'71 Westy has been in the paint shop (a real long story that has gone on for
5 months) and hating every minute of it. Only a bus driver would
understand!!!

Anyway, as VW Bus karma would have it, I was looking in this mornings paper
for a new beetle to buy (if your going to drive a W/C, might as well be
comfortable) when I saw an ad for a '71 bus. OK says I, might as well call.
Went to see it and the father of the boy's bus was there to show it to me.
They had bought the bus two years earlier for the son to drive and he was
tired of it.

I started looking. OK bad dent in front but the front bumper is perfect.
Look in wheel wells- no rust there. Look underneath at the pan- no rust
there. No rust in Ohio- what's up. Open the front door and get the shock of
my life. Front seats-middle seat and back seat all there and the upholstery
is perfect. Not stock but close and a quality job. Look up and the headliner
is new and perfect. Oil pressure, oil temp., voltmeter, and CHT gauges are
there with a tack. Father says they were in when he bought it. Lift up the
front carpeting- no rust there. Lift up the carpeting in the back- no rust
there. I'm dumb-founded. Father couldn't care less.

Open up the engine lid- a oil free engine that looks so clean you could eat
off of it. Oil filter installed. Seals all new and in place. Fuse block for
acc. wiring with a relay for the starter wire. No hot start problems here.

Needs, body work (not rustoration) and a paint job. Tires. A lot of TLC.

If your still reading this is where the story gets going. I quickly reach a
deal as he wants it out of there. Go into the house to do the money thing
and the son says,&quot;Did you show him the folder&quot;. What folder? The son
produces a folder showing pictures of the engine being built and receipts
for over $1,500.00 in parts alone from Larry's off-road. Engine has CW
crank, balanced, balanced rods to race standards, 30mm oil pump, new heads,
etc.etc. Whoo- I'm impressed.

Come home, come down off cloud 9, and call the previous owner and here is a
short story of the 1 hr. conversation. Bus was bought in Fla. by the PPO
(reason for no rust)and brought to Ohio. PPO did interior restoration, all
new brakes, all new ball joints and front end (installed a used steering box
also). Had the engine rebuilt but got taken to the cleaners. The PO rebuilt
the engine using the best parts available. Larry's Off-Road, a quality shop
did the machine work. I'm in 7th. heaven and all is right with the world.

Anyway, thanks for letting me  share this with you as non-bus drivers just
don't understand. Later TBear

Don't take life too seriously- you'll never live through it.
