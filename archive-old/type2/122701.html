&gt; &lt;&lt; Has anyone out there stripped the padding from a Bay dash?

&gt; 
&gt; Doing that &quot;might&quot; cause problems with whatever safety inspection(s) your
&gt; particular state requires...Another problem &quot;might&quot; be with insurance if 
&gt; someone is hurt in the bus...Removing the crash padding is technically
&gt; illegal (as is removing any safety or emissions related equipment...)

The potential safety inspection violation I understand, and doubt would be
an issue with most inspectors.

Crash &quot;padding&quot; would have to be a term used VERY loosely. I have 3 dashes
sitting in storage. None are in perfect condition but one isn't too bad.
All 3, after 30 years, are almost as hard as the metal they cover. They
would provide almost no shock absorption at this point and I don't believe
there is a &quot;new&quot; replacement available.
