John, I saw a sign behind the counter of a small, mom and pop FLAPS once that said:
  
  PRICE    QUALITY    SERVICE
  
              Pick Two
  
  
  Think about it. So true!  Cheers...KR

It is true we (Aircooled.Net) are more expensive on some stuff then other
stores, but we are also cheaper then anyone else on others, but all I hear
is bitching on the list about how someone is too expensive. You can give me
ANY vendor out there, and I can find a product where they are more expensive
then other places. The most common reason for this is because people are
ASSUMING the part is the same part. It may have the same description, and
&quot;fit&quot; the same application (or not LOL), but one may be made in Taiwan while
another is in Brazil, another is in Germany, one in India, and another USA.
So are they the same as being stated as such when comparing prices, or when
bashing a vendor about &quot;how expensive&quot; they are? This is the crap that gets
old, because it's not as simple as it appears to most list readers, they
assume all parts are the same (they are not).
