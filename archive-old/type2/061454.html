I solved an ancient warm up problem with my 80 Westy.  I thought for sure I had some sort of fuel injection problem because it wanted to stall out for the first five minutes after starting.  If it succeeded in stalling, it was real hard to restart almost like it was flooded.

A carefull look in the Bosch Fuel Injection manual (a great manual) revealed the idle air bypass valve.  This valve increases idle speed during the first few minutes after starting, like the fast idle on a choke.  It sure seemed like mine wasn't working.

Now for the tricky part.  This valve is supposed to be open when cold to allow extra metered air to enter the intake.  But how open, is open?  After observing that there was in fact an open hole in this valve when cold, I discovered this hole could be pryed open further with an awl.  I spent a few minutes grimacing about how expensive this part was likely to be at a VW dealer.  Then to my total amazement, I further discovered the valve's adjustable.  By lossening the only nut on its housing, I was able to open the air hole quite a bit further and get the fast idle I needed.  Result, no more stalling after cold starts.
