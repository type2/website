&gt; An engineer who designs everything in the best possible way would work

&gt; as it would raise the cost of the car.

    True -- and I'm not in the least demeaning the abilities of German
enineering. After all, they for a long, long time were the very pinnacle
of high-tech. German optics, cameras, guns -- gads, Walthers, for
example. And even the vW engineers, I'm sure, are very knowledgable.

&gt;
&gt; Yes, VW engineering can be improved upon, but not by stripping off the
&gt; systems that the engineers installed, because every one of these
&gt; systems were essential.  If they weren't, they wouldn't be there!

    Well, useful, maybe, but not necessarily essential. My original
objection was to comments to the effect that removing the flaps, or even
the thermostat would lead to ruination of the engine, and that just
isn't true at all, especially if the owner is faithful at warming it up
a bit before driving off -- something that should be done with all
vehicles, flaps in or no.
    Let's take this a little further. We all know that the auto industry
could easily build us cars that would last us a lifetime -- but of
course, if they did that, they'd go under. If we look at autos up until
the late forties, early fifties, it's clear that they were built &quot;hell
for stout&quot;. Then things changed -- the auto industry very clearly began
a campaign of accelerated &quot;planned obsolescense&quot;. First they were
content to try to make it work with style changes, later it was clearly
making junkier cars. Cars that rusted out quickly, wore out quickly.
     It was about in this same era that VW started really importing into
the US. Now, you sell a car to Joe Lunchbox, the quintessential American
shade-tree mechanic -- and that's who was buying VW, lower class workers
and students and the like. They knew damn well how to take care of a
car, been doing it for years, right? Those old Fords and Chevys, heck,
why take it to the dealer for service? Change the oil every Fall and
Spring, or every 10,000 miles or so, put in new plugs every couple of
years -- no need for anything else, right?
     So maybe those crafty German engineers figured -- hey, no oil
filter. Snicker. Hey, design this thing so the valves burn if you don't
adjust them often. Ever heard a vW called &quot;Hitler's Revenge&quot;? Every
think about how angry a lot of those people were back then about being
defeated? So lets design this thing so it works -- IF the owner takes it
to the dealer all the time. How about some design like that thermostat
cable that always breaks, and the flaps that are *supposed* to stay open
if it fails, but then, of course, if that little spring gets unhooked or
breaks, they flop back closed while you're cruising the highways.
     Well -- that's the kind of stuff I think about when people talk
about &quot;the VW engineers designed it right and ...&quot;  Every worked in a
car factory? I have. I spent a year working in the American Motors plant
in Kenosha, WI as an apprentice electrician. I spent the nights up on a
ladder and crawling around above the assembly lines fixing lights. While
the line was in full operation -- quite an educational experience. Just
an incredible amount of sabatoge going on, pop bottles welded inside
frames, doors, etc. Valve grinding compound in engines and trannys. And
liquor bottle everywhere you looked.
    Now, American Motors is a far cry from a German autoplant. But I
just don't have any illusions about engineers or workers. It's obvious
that a lot of engineering in this world is done not just to save a penny
here and there, but to actually shorten the life of a unit -- otherwise
who would buy more? And workmanship -- well.
    I started buying VW's not too long after working at AM, and one of
the reasons was that I felt the Germans (and Japanese as well) clearly
had a lot more pride and craftsmanship than Americans. And probably
that's still true, but I'll never accept the idea that &quot;the engineers
know better than you&quot;. There are a lot of reasons things get designed or
built the way they do, and not necessarily good ones.
    But I really do like German stuff, just the same. VW's, Walthers,
and my current lust is for a '60 BMW bike.
