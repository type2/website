&gt; Hello list-
&gt;    I've got a '71 Adventure Camper highroof that needs brake work.
&gt; Unfortunately, the calipers appear to be very rusty and the rotors are too
&gt; thin to turn.  I have a few later model parts buses and was wondering if
&gt; anyone has done a swap from the 71-72 brakes to the 73-79 brakes?  I don't
&gt; want to spend a mint on this, as I'm just putting it on the road to sell,
&gt; but if anyone has experiance with this, could you tell me how far I have to
&gt; go?  Are the spindles the same or do I need to change them also? Thanks
&gt; Joe

The calipers are much larger in the 73+ than the 71/72 versions and will not fit
on the spindles.  I believe the rotors are larger also.  A quickie fix for you
might be to go to a junk yard and pull everything from torsion arm out on both
sides and then rebolt onto your bus.  Any way its a LOT of work to do just to
sell.

I have done the above in a manner of speaking.
Took a '69 beam and pulled the torsion arms and drums off.  Went to the junk yard
and for $125 got all four sets of brakes, spindles, hubs, torsion arms etc, etc.
Rebuilt the beam, put the discs on the beam and its all ready to go waiting for me
to put the whole assembly on my '60 DC.


Scott
