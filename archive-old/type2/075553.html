Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Pump for a 78

Doktor Tim,

That was the Bus depot that has listed in their online
catalog rebuilt pumps for ~$127.

I have a farm, and I am not exactly rich as I work for
the state in a University as a computer man.  Oh yeah,
the one car that is fairly new, the outback, I had to
buy as the others I had (the brat, f150, the van) all
would not get me anywhere without breaking down.  The
97 Kings Canyon is a bicycle, Tandem bike.  A person
needs exercise, and therapy sometimes in their
relationships, what better way than this?  Oh yeah, I
did that one on the cheap too, Bought the frame
(wholseale, I worked at a  bike shop part time) and I
scrounged and mooched alot of other parts for it.

I have a farm, yeah that costs money in a mortgage,
but you know, I would rather own something, than pay
rent and never get anything out of it.  I don't live
expensive either, my house is a doulblewide, and my
land I had cheap.  Guess what? $107 k mortgage and I
have a 1700 sg ft house, basement, 45 acres.  Sounds
good, doesn't it?

SO I needed good transportation, that is where the
Outback comes in.  Guess how much I got that for? 
$12500, cheap as the wholseale price on it at the time
was $13200, and the retail was $18100.  I am the
master at making my money work, and it is not because
I have lots of it or mommy and daddy helped me out,
because they didn't and they never had.  Am I mad
about that? No.  But, I sure do know how to make $30k
a year stretch, don't I?  And that is not by spending
$220 plus on fru fru pumps.

Thanks all for the help.

I am not mad at Doktor Tim's post, maybe he can help
me out with some details and less criticism.

Finest Regards,

Mark

Oh Yeah, I paid $350 for the BMW 600 (way old) and
$750 for the 86 F150 4x4, everybody on a farm needs a
farm truck.

&gt; Not even Bosch can rebuild a Bosch FI fuel pump.
&gt; Watch out for that $127
&gt; rebuild by who????? If you want the most money when
&gt; your 60, pay the price
&gt; for a new Bosch pump now. Compromise is great risk
&gt; of pain for your wallet. 
&gt; 
&gt; You wallet just ain't deep enough to carry the
&gt; freight??? Bust ass, get an
&gt; evening part time job. If you ain't got enough
&gt; time/money to make it work
&gt; for sure, how do you justify throwing away money on
&gt; cheap?????? 
&gt; 
&gt; Hit a junkyard, take your chances. Look for a
&gt; possible newer replacement
&gt; pump on a ratty chassis. Sometimes you get lucky.
&gt; The risk is quick failure
&gt; of an old pump that has been inactive for more than
&gt; a year. Might work a
&gt; week, might work for an hour, might not work at all.
&gt; You risk all with
&gt; hopin' and guessin'. You risk nothing with a new
&gt; Bosch pump, if you install
&gt; it correctly, and put in a new filter to insure
&gt; results. 
&gt; 
&gt; Criminy, if you can afford 5 vehicles, two of which
&gt; are less than 4 years
&gt; old,  how is it you can't afford a new pump, how is
&gt; it you can afford to
&gt; throw money at squeeky cheap on the VW so's you can
&gt; make the mortgage
&gt; payments on the newer rides,????
