All you need is a locking tape measure. I use the STANLEY *Leverlock* 
myself.;&gt;)

&gt; Since I recently put new tie rod ends in my bus, it needed to have the
&gt; toe-in set. Yesterday (saturday) I drove around town looking for
&gt; places that were open. I stopped by an auto parts store I'd been to
&gt; several times that had an alignment bay, Western Auto. When I went in,
&gt; I was told that they were booked through the end of the day, but they
&gt; had a bay open at 11:00 sunday. So rather than go look for another
&gt; place, I decided to go ahead and do that. Well, when I went there this
&gt; morning, I was informed the technician couldn't work on my car because
&gt; &quot;he didn't have the tools&quot;. I explained the tools necessary were 2
&gt; 14mm box ends, a wrench to turn the adjustable tie rod, and an
&gt; alignment rig. The counter droid went and got the &quot;general manager&quot;
&gt; who said that &quot;every time we try to align an old bug something
&gt; breaks&quot;. I pointed out the reason I needed an alignment was because I
&gt; had new tie rod ends, and I had thus just undone the clamp bolts and
&gt; put in new tie rod ends, and tightened the clamp bolts, and that I
&gt; knew everything would turn freely and no breakage would occur. Then he
&gt; informed me that &quot;they just don't line well,&quot; and that's why they
&gt; didn't do alignments on VW's, Renaults, or BMWs.
&gt; 
&gt; I wouldn't have minded this so much, except the fact that they took an
&gt; appointment for one day, and made me come back before turning me down,
&gt; on a day where I couldn't get it done anywhere else, and then gave me
&gt; this chickenshit &quot;we don't have the tools&quot; excuse from the &quot;front end
&gt; technician&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; I won't be going back there...
&gt; 
&gt; It's annoying to have to pay someone $40 to adjust toe-in anyway, I
&gt; need to invest in a rig to do it myself.
