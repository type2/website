Subject: Re: [T2] once upon a pre-owned tuna can

To Hal Sullivan:
    
I don't doubt anything you have said.  But as yet, my
T2 has not been restored to the point of
dependability.  It will reach that point.  Perhaps in
2006?  It will also be given a gleaming paint-job that
is so perfect, it will take-out CIA satelites on sunny
days.  But until then, I have not caught-up on the
decade+ of PO abuse, the long list of things which
need fixing.  The Prior Owner could easily have
scrapped this T2 beast before I embarked on it's
resurrection.
   
It is all relative.  Currently, M.P. is in a sorry
state of repair.  But give me time!  :-)  This T2 of
my WILL become dependable, and warm, and in a state of
good repair!
