I blew a piston in my 83 Aircooled, it allowed blow-by past a broken ring
and collapsed ring land.
I  drove my van 250 miles to get home and added a quart of oil about
every 35 miles.
My engine blew oil out of places that I couldn't even name but most of
the oil was coming out of the valve covers even after I stopped and
installed new gaskets and re-loaded the spring binders to be tighter. 
Check your compression, it could have a serious problem but still run.
Clean your engine with motor cleaner, top to bottom  use a brush or
whatever it takes to get it very clean on the top and down under; then
start looking for leaks. Gunk Engine cleaner is pretty good and its
cheap.
Hold your finger over the end of the dipstick tube after removing the
dipstick, if its got preassure you've got a problem.
Glueing your valve cover gaskets to the covers is a very good idea but
you need to install them before the glue dries so you get a nice flat
adhesion and no warbles in the gasket.
Recently I found a leaking oil preasure sender unit that only leaked at
45 PSI and above (it was a new defective part).
If someone has worked on your engine and used silicone sealer, you need
to remove the sealer and get back to the machined surface (little bits of
old silicone sealer left in the lower pushrod tubes will cause leaks).
And finally; one of the screws on the top of my engine that holds the
sheet-metal had been stripped and someone re-tapped the hole and drilled
it all the way through the top of the crankcase. I use a copper washer on
this screw.
Twenty year old engines could have been rebuilt four or fve times and in
that many cars too.
My rule about buying aircooled vehicles of any type is &quot;Take the price of
the car, deduct the price of a rebuilt engine and offer that for the
car&quot;.
I've wrecked out about six vanagons and only found one good head out of
all of those I pulled off.
Thats my war stories so just make it clean and run it at about 2000 RPM
and you leak will appear.

&gt; Hi everybody!
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, I checked the valve covers, and yes Jake I had the passenger 
&gt; side
&gt; upside down!!  Then I noticed something else.  I had bought two sets 
&gt; of
&gt; valve gaskets, one cork from a wholesaler (as a backup) and another
&gt; grayish type material from the dealership.  I installed the dealer 
&gt; ones
&gt; the first time.  I noticed however that the gasket did not fill up 
&gt; the
&gt; entire channel on the cover but at the time I paid no heed to that.
&gt; 
&gt; This time, I had a closer look, and on a lark put in the cork ones.
&gt; They seemed to fit much better and not only filled the channel but 
&gt; had a
&gt; small bulge.  So I seated them and used my rubber mallet to make 
&gt; sure
&gt; that the covers are properly set.
&gt; 
&gt; Hopefully this works.  I do not think that the push rods are 
&gt; leaking,
&gt; but you never know.  There is still a lot of oil running down the 
&gt; rod
&gt; plates, on the exchangers and onto the block itself.  If the covers 
&gt; were
&gt; leaking, would the weeping travel that far?  Or could there be 
&gt; another
&gt; seal or gasket leaking somewhere else?
