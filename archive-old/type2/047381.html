&gt;  I would compare the torque curve of the Honda 1.6 with, say, a VW 2.0
&gt; pancake
&gt; (67 SAE hp_at_4200, 101 lb/ft_at_ 3000) and make sure it is better before
&gt; proceeding,
&gt; otherwise you may find you have a bus that's hard work to keep rolling and
&gt; no
&gt; fun to drive.

You might consider one of the new VW 1.8 turbo engines.  155 lb-ft. of
torque _at_ 1750-4600 rpm.  What that means is you get the max torque of the
engine early (1750 rpm) but the engine is such that that max torque is
available all the way up until 4600 rpm.  Not too shabby!

You also get 150 hp _at_ 5700 rpm, though you have to run premium gas :-)
