&gt;- engine turns 1-3 degrees and goes clunk against something in 
&gt;either direction.  Otherwise it appears that maybe it's not seizing -- 
&gt;this is not the stiffness it had last time around.  Maybe it's not even 
&gt;inside the case.

Might not be, but that sounds very similar to a dowel pin popping out of its 
seat and being
crushed between the main bearing and the main bearing bore.
