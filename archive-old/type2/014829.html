If there is no paperwork, you can call your local pd with the licence or vin 
#, all you can ask is if its stolen, they won't give registered owner info. 
If there is no paperwork, you will have to file a lost pink transfer. Not a 
big problem except it has to be notorized. To really find out make a trip to 
the dmv and start the process, thats where you really find out the info. The 
best to hope for is no vin on file, then your free and clear.
