Subject: lifter pump up noise

Folks,

After just reading a post on the Subaru forum(I have a new one) and 
someone was complaining about a loud knock that lasted about 10 seconds 
when they started their  car up.

Made me think about the fact that both are horizontally opposed engines, 
so has anyone ever gotten to examine a Subaru hydraulic lifter?

Any obvious diffferences between how their hydraulic lifters  are made and 
how ours are made?

So far, my Subaru has never made a lifter sound like my bus...even after 
several days of sitting.

Just wondering, dave
