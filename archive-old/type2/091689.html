Anthony,

I don't now about BGW--but I do know 3M has the wood grain
available---in several shades ---
What in the heck you would do for a border around the wood grain I
haven't a clue---
Maybe some light tan stick on moulding would work---

A Bus, or a Van Woodie would be neat---

Just Thinking---

Later,

Terry

I like it, but not quite to my taste...Anybody familiar with the BGW
Spectre kit to convert a Bug into a Mini-Woodie? OK, anybody know if
such a kit is available for a the Van...I've seen a PT Cruiser with such
a kit (and once upon a time drove and worked on a real Mini
Traveller/Clubman)...Any info out there that can help?-) 
Thanks in advance for any help in this search.
