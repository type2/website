Okay, all kidding about heat aside, if you camping types want an incredible 
experience, consider ANY campground near Canaveral and Cape Kennedy.  They 
launched a shuttle at 6:15 this am, just at dawn, and we can see the launches 
from here in St. Pete, over 140 miles away. It must be AWESOME from the 
campgrounds at the Cape. A fiery orange plume following the rocket, which is 
actually visible from here, turning into silver white as it rises above the 
groundhaze, and turning brilliant silver the higher it goes. We can see the 
solid rocket boosters tumbling as they fall away, reflecting sunlight. So 
there we were, in bare feet, standing in the street, no one else around,after 
scrambling outta bed as the countdown started on the clockradio,  and I'm 
thinking,&quot;this is even better than a night launch, which is pretty amazing.&quot;  
Keep meaning to get over there to camp. Only prob is, they almost never go 
when they say they gonna. Always seems to be a delay or two.  Five minutes 
after going inside, while making coffee, the windows start to rattle, and I'm 
just sure it was the sonic wave from the blast-off.  Infreakingcredible. They 
got a web site at NASA with camp info, I believe.
