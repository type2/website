Subject: Re: [T2] what oil

&gt; Here it seemed to me VW engineers had designed in the thinning property of
&gt; single-weight oil as part of the overall engine design.  Using a multigrade
&gt; oil such as Mobil 1 15-50 or Castrol GTX 10-40 that does not appreciably
&gt; thin at higher temperature then defeats, in theory at least, the purpose of
&gt; the valve and cause the oil and engine to run hotter.

well at least according to Mobil, the synthetics always flow at the lower
number and always lubricate at the higher number and do not change
apparent viscosity as temperatures change.

my experience with synthetics is that there is an ever so slight thinning
as the oil gets above 220degrees based on the combination of readings from
my oil preasure and temp guages
