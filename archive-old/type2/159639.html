Pretty cheap, too!  That would be sweet, especially if you put a pot up 
front to control the speed.. neeeeat-o!

Plus, they look pretty low-profile.  Duroc, I'm totally down to do this 
ASAP as I'm going to be camping up in big bear soon.  I just refurbed my 
entire heater duct system up front and I'd like to do more.

Let me know if you need any help and/or want to collaborate on ideas.  I 
have all next week off so I'm totally down to do this.

Do you know what the stock airflow rate is that the engine and bilge 
blower put out.  Do you think two of these fans would exceed the flow of 
the stock system?

ooh, and they sell them at home depot.  What fan were you looking at? 
And if a different one, how big and what kinda flow?
