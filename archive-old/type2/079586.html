&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   To all of you that have e-mailed me I'm am informing you of major mail
&gt; &gt; problems I am currently having. We have moved my server and all my
&gt; &gt; accounts, including all of my URL's have also been moved. Currently
&gt; &gt; www.type2parts_dot_com is not working properly, but www.oldvolks_dot_com is up
and
&gt; &gt; running. I am recieving e-mails, but have lost quit a few in the last
few
&gt; &gt; days. This is why I may not have replied to you. Also a lot of the mail
to
&gt; &gt; sales_at_oldvolks was also lost. We are working very hard to get all of
these
&gt; &gt; problems corrected and should have all done within the next week.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; thank-you
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ronnie  Old Volks of Az
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ps. if whoever sees this could they forward it to the type2, vintagebus
&gt; &gt; and vintage vw lists.
