&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; Today my wife and I joined the air cooled VW cult.  I currently hold
&gt; membership in both the water cooled ('81 pickup, yay!) and our newest
&gt; addition, a '77 bay bus.
&gt;
&gt;
You'll know you're a real Bus cultist when your wife says,
&quot;Honey, there's a hill up ahead. Let's get lunch now.&quot;
