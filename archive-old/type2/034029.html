I think it's fair to say there's one Charlie (Ford) and one Chuck
(Meanley). Sheesh. No comparison. Chuck, quit throwing out those
gauntlets, I'm liable to pick one up and schmack ya widdit. ;-)

We're up to 13 Davids: 
3 in CO
2 in GA
2 in TX (1 temp. in LV)
1 in AZ
1 in SC
1 in NC
1 at BugJunction
1 in GB (Horrigan? with the Devon)
1 in CA -- I almost bought a bus from

3 Tims (2 on the list and one I worked with in Santa Cruz with a double-cab)

2 Steves, holdin' steady. I guess the two we've got are high-profile,
like Ethridge's bus. It just *seems* like we have a lot of them. :-)
