Subject: Exhaust

I Have a 70 bus with a 1776 engine. I am in need of a new exhaust
system. I currently have a single quiet pak. I am looking to change to a
dual muffler setup with a new manifold also. Anybody have any experience
with this type of system and which one would be best suited for my
engine. Also where can I get one. Thanks

Sharon
