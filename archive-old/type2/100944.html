&gt; &gt; While it &quot;might&quot; have a 914 engine most likely it is just the pancake
&gt; &gt; which shares many of the same design features as the 914 engine. There
&gt; &gt; is most likely an easier way to check, but the way I know is that on

&gt; &gt; Many people try to distinguish the upright engine (i.e. beetles &amp;
&gt; &gt; older busses) and the T4 (or T2) engine which has a fan on the end of
&gt; &gt; the crankshaft, this way.

and just to add to the confusion the T3 engine is a T1/2 engine with the
fan on the end of the crankshaft....
&gt; 
&gt; The easy difference is in the engine case- The 914 dipstick is on top
&gt; next to the breather and the bus-type oil filler location is a closed
&gt; casting.
&gt; The fan housing is also closed at the dipstick and won't work for bus.

well again not so cut and dried the &quot;real&quot; T4 engine in the 411/412 sedans
will also have the closed off end and dipstick on the top...

about the only &quot;Real&quot; way to know for sure is the engine serial number
