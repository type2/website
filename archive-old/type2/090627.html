Subject: Sadness- bus sold

Well, the bus sold.  I watched my 74 westy drive
off with a new captain yesterday.  Actually, two
new captains, Gretchen and Birch, soon to be
newlyweds, both whom I expect to be new members
soon.  

Gretchen and Birch, I would go to www.type2_dot_com,
www.fullmoonbusclub_dot_com, and
http://groups.yahoo_dot_com/group/ohiovalleytribe and
join as a member.  These lists will be very
helpful to you as far as maintaining your bus
(especially type2) and having fun with your bus
(especially fullmoon and our local chapter OVT.)

I sent pics from Everybus with them to get there
interest piqued regarding making some events with
you folks.  They loved Bear's Spacemaker, Spiffy,
the hippy bus with the black lights (I cannot for
the life of me think of his name). 

Britt and Gretchen live in a huge farm in the
most beautiful area of the rural southern West
Virginia mountains.  Sounds like a perfect place
for a future FMBC/Tribe event, right folks?  

I'm busless for only the second time in about two
decades, but it must be done.  Three cars down,
the house to go still.   I'm not going to HCBF
but I may go to Dixie.  In lieu of condolences or
flowers, please send cash to my favorite charity.


=====
Peace and blessings, 
Nemo, the Busless Captain
