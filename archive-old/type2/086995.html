&gt; Troy,
&gt; 	Here is not what I have already done, but what I plan on doing.

sort of like what I have already done

&gt; Since there are several accessories I might like to add later I
&gt; started thinking that the way to do it is to buy an additional fuse
&gt; block. Mount it under the dash &amp; run all accessories off it. I am not
&gt; sure if I will run a larger wire back to the engine or just take off

well I ran a heavy wire to a large fuse then independently fused each item
I ran from this bus wire..put an accessory dual cig lighter block under
the dash (does not mare the dash itself) also run my independent heat
blower and the gas heater, and well I can't remember what all from it.

&gt; one unused terminal on my fuse block. But on my fuse block there was
&gt; one unused fuse/terminal. I used this to connect my CB &amp; Radio. To get
&gt; to the terminals unhook the batter &amp; then unscrew the 2 (i think)
&gt; screws holding the fuse block on the metal. There was one of mine
&gt; which had nothing comming off the top end. I used a spade connector to
&gt; get power +12v off this. &amp; used the existing ground on the frame for
&gt; the ground side of my electronics. Hope this helps.

&gt; &gt; Hello all,
&gt; &gt;             I got a CB radio today.  After EB I knew I should get one.
&gt; &gt; My buddy gave me his old one.  So I am home now, and the electrical
&gt; &gt; genious in me has a question.  How in the world do I hook it up?  A lot
&gt; &gt; of people said the splice a line off the cigarette lighter.  Well, I
&gt; &gt; aint got one a dem darn things!!  I have no electrical experience at all
&gt; &gt; and am not even quite sure what I need.  I do have a package that has
&gt; &gt; connectors and a crimper and stuff.  Any guidance for the mentally
&gt; &gt; challenged?  Thanks
