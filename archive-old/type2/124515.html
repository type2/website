Subject: Bad valve guide

I drove from New Hamshire to clearwater Florida, and about 20 miles short of
my destination the 73 1700 cc engine started dying at idle. had to be towed
last 20 miles.
Next morning i look under valve covers and see a load of metal oppisite
exhaust valve #4.  I do not think i was pushing it too hard.
Next morning it would start and run rough.  Many local mechanics said try and
drive home see how far you get.
My dad drove down at the end of spring break and towed the bus home.
Pulled the engine and head.  cumbustion chamber and valve head looks the same
as #3, yet #4 ex valve has 1/4&quot; side play.
Plan to have head rebuilt.
Change oil pump, oil cooler.
My question is has any one else had this happen and would caused it?
I would like to &quot;convert&quot; the solid lifters to hydraulic while it is out. Is
this just switch lifters and rockers?
Any guidance would be appreciatted.
