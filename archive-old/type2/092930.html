Okay, I'm relaxed now, sorry.  :)

&gt;Again, NOT an attack but related to pressure regulators, if you have a
&gt;regulator that's chrome with the arrow on the dial type, throw it as far
&gt;away from your bus as possible. The only true regulator to use are the
&gt;Holley and Mallory style's, they work very well.

I agree.  I have a Holley and it is a nice piece of hardware.  It's mounted 
on the firewall panel right in the middle with a line going out each side 
to the dual carbs.  Looks like it was made to live there.
