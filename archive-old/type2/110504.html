Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Heat riser repair

&gt; &gt;Good point.  How do the heat riser tubes seal to the center section?
&gt; &gt;Since there is exhaust going through that tube I want to keep in inside!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Aren't they just brazed?  Can't you have it re-braze welded?

No I think not
the riser tubes run through that middle casting which I think is aluminum.
