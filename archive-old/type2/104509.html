Subject: bay area bus campout!

Rush to the Redwoods, on March 28, 29 and 30th.

Amazing campgrounds, even better hikes, and one of the coolest drives along 
the CA coast to get there/back.

ChristopherAW_at_vendio_dot_com if you need any further information.

We have about 20 or so people so far, and all are welcome!
