&gt; Drove her from Sacramento up to Chico beginning just before noon today
&gt; (arrived in Chico at about 2PM), where we filled her up with gas. She
&gt; wouldn't start. Let her cool down for an hour; no luck. Banged on the
&gt; starter with a hammer....no luck. Towed to the local VW dealer....mechanic
&gt; gave the starter one tap with a hammer, with the ignition key in the start
&gt; position (key point?), and she fired right up.

The solution to this problem is the installation of a Bosch WR-1 relay
kit.  Any Volkswagen parts dealer can supply one.

&gt; Normal highway oil temperature is 260 degrees (sensor in the bottom of the
&gt; engine....a temperature gauge is one of the upgrades we had put in her right
&gt; after the purchase). Climbing out of Chico on highway 32, a moderately
&gt; steep, somewhat long grade, at 45-50 mph in 3rd gear....she hit 300 degrees
&gt; quite quickly and a tapping noise (rods?) started coming from the engine
&gt; compartment. Turned around right way and headed back down the hill for
&gt; home....temperature dropped back to 260...climbing to 270 or so at red
&gt; lights.

260 is not a normal temperature.  It is too high.  300 degrees is very
much too high and you are risking engine damage.

The major factors in engine overheating are speed, impeded air flow, and
fuel mixture.  Climbing a hill in third gear 50 is much too fast.
Although the marks on the speedometer tell you it is possible, in real
life it is not.  If you limit the speed in third to 40-45 miles per hour
your engine will be much happier.  On level ground I have found that 60-65
miles per hour is also the engine's limit when air temperatures are above
80 degrees.

The early vanagons also have a design defect in their engine hatch cover.
The early hatches were made of metal and the sound insulation was fibre
pads held in place by wires.  Over time these pads shed and the fibres are
suck through the fan and form a felt pad on top of the oil cooler. This
limits air flow thru the cooler and overheating is the result.  The
immediate treatment is to run a high pressure spray up through the bottom
of the oil cooler.  If this results in significant improvement in oil
temperatures then the more permanent solution of removing the fan shroud
and cleaning the cooler from on top is necessary. In any event you should
look for an engine hatch from a later watercooled vanagon.  The later
covers are plastic and foam.  As a result they are are much lighter and do
not shed.

You hould have your fuel mixture checked by a mechanic. With an exhaust
gas analyzer he can tell if the mixture is correct or lean.  If your
mixture is lean he can suggest corrective actions.

You have probably not done permanent damage to the engine if it sounds
normal after cooling.  I would suggest replacing the oil before going any
further.  If you are running a multi-viscosity oil, you have certainly
damaged its multi-viscosity properties. If you are going to accept 250-260
as a normal operating temperature I would advise you not to run a
multi-viscosty oil but rather a straight-weight SAE40 or 50 weight oil. I
would also suggest that 250-260 is the maximum temperature you should
allow the oil to reach.  If it goes higher I would advise slowing down or
pulling over to allow the engine to cool.

                             OOK!
