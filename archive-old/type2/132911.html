Ahh... sorry, I misread the message as you saying the engine came with
the 009 and you were trying to time that dizzy.

Set your vacuum one to 6deg BTDC with everything hooked up. You can
check total advance (48 deg? Shoot, can't remember..)  but between 5
and 7.5 will be fine. You can tweak as needed when you drive.

My vacuum dizzy had to be set at 7 for best performance. But
variations in manufacture are why you have to play with it to get it
just right.

Engine doesn't matter since it's the advance curve you're changing,
and that's dependant on the dizzy itself.

Enjoy!

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Time the 009 based on TOTAL advance. IIRC you want it at 30 degrees
&gt; total advance with the engine revved up (3500rpm?)
&gt;
&gt; I'm sure someone else on the list has the exact numbers, but setting
&gt; the 009 at idle is just to get the engine running well enough to set
&gt; the total advance.
&gt;
&gt; BTW: The 009 sucks. Just so you know. ;-)
