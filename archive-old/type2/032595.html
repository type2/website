Leo... if your '69 is like my '71 ( and for this question, I think so) that 
push/pull knob (down low, right side?) is for controlling a heat flap under 
the bus to divert heated air towards the rear cargo/passenger area.  In a 
walk-thru, ya can see the vents between the two front seats, facing the rear 
of the bus, at the back of the walk thru.

The control flaps are under the bus, at a &quot;Y&quot; type junction....with a curvey 
section of paper heater hose to divert the warmish air thru those vents, when 
ya pull/push the knob.

Hope this helps
