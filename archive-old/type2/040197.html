Subject: Re: Oil pressure light flickering (similar problem on my '69)

Yeah, I'm having a similar problem on my '69....

I started a new job recently, and have to drive some
highway miles to and from. There are some pretty
decent hills, to boot. After driving the hills at
highway speed (or as close as I can get;-) and coming
to an idle, my oil light comes on, and stays on until
I rev the motor a bit, even though the dipstick checks
out fine. And to further confuse the issue, it only
happens every few days!

I haven't logged/measured my oil consumption lately,
but the last time I did, it was in spec (per owners
manual), of 1-2 quarts every 1,000 miles. I will do
that again, as soon as I need oil. I have a good idea
on this one..._dot_carry 2 qts. of oil, along with a black
felt-tip pen, and when you add the *first* quart of
oil, write your odometer reading on the outside of the
*second* quart. Then replace the *first* quart with a
new one, and repeat the proceedure. That way, you
check your consumption (accurately) every time you add
oil. Each time you need oil, you will see the writing,
and you'll never forget to write it down again (I
tried the notebook method, but I kept forgetting to
write everything down).

The bus is a '69 Westy, 1600sp (120+/-5lbs all
around), with a doghouse cooler installed. I also have
the little 'T' fitting on my oil pressure sending unit
for my VDO oil pressure guage.

The only recent changes (in the last 2 years, anyway)
have been a switch from 10w-30, to 20w-50, and the
fact that I'm driving on the highway (lots of short,
stop and go for the last 2 years....very little
highway).

Any ideas??

&gt; I have a 1980 Vanagon that seems pretty much stock.
&gt; About 70,000 on the 
&gt; odometer and probably original as the rest of the
&gt; bus and camper package 
&gt; looks great. Right after I got it, I changed oil and
&gt; filter (used MANN filter 
&gt; from Bus Depot-it had a Fram from PO). I normally
&gt; use Valvoline SAE 30 but 
&gt; was using Chevron SAE 30 due to FLAPS being out of
&gt; the Valvoline 30. After 
&gt; the change, I drove to town (Ridgecrest, 25 miles
&gt; one way) and didn't notice 
&gt; any problems. I drove back including a killer hill
&gt; in the last mile-almost 
&gt; had to go to 2nd gear at one point. Pulled into my
&gt; place and when engine went 
&gt; to idle the oil light began flickering rapidly.
&gt; After the engine cooled 
&gt; everything normal. Happened on second trip to town a
&gt; few days later. I 
&gt; changed the oil to Valvoline SAE 40 (we are now in
&gt; the 90-100 degree 
&gt; temperature phase of our climate). Seemed OK, until
&gt; drove home again up the 
&gt; &quot;hill&quot; and got oil light flicker. I have brand new
&gt; engine compartment seal in 
&gt; place for both trips. All other cooling system parts
&gt; seem to be there and 
&gt; functional except thermostat doesn't look like it
&gt; changes position. Local VW 
&gt; shop said it fails to &quot;open&quot; for max cooling. Any
&gt; suggestions? I cannot find 
&gt; specific reference to this problem but vaguely
&gt; remember (old age) list 
&gt; mention in last year. Thanks for help.
