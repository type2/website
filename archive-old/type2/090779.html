Bill,

I recommend AGAINST using Ether of any sort inside the engine compartment
of a bus.  Ether is very explosive over a wide range of concentrations.
To make it explosive, all you have to do is mix any appreciable amount
with air in an enclosed space and apply a spark.  The steel box that is
the engine compartment supplies the enclosure on five sides of the box and
your body in the hatchway supplies the enclosure on the sixth.  Guess
which one wil blow out in the event that the ether/air mix finds a source
of ignition? (like a defective spark plug wire?)

For some idea of what a fuel/air explosion is like, here is a write-up
from the Weekly Standard:

Here's how your average fuel-air bomb works: A warhead containing a
canister of aerosol liquid such as ethylene oxide or an explosive powder
is dropped on a target. &quot;A small initial explosive charge bursts this
canister at a predetermined height, allowing the contents to form a
concentrated explosive vapor cloud. This cloud is then ignited by a
second, larger charge, to generate an intense fireball and blast
overpressure. . . . Even if the FAE (fuel-air explosive) fails to detonate
completely, it will generate a widespread burning effect,&quot; says Jane's.
&quot;The temperature can be as high as 3,000 degrees Celsius--more than twice
that generated by a conventional explosive. The blast wave can travel at
approximately 10,000 feet per second.&quot;

Please use WD-40 or something else less flammable for checking vacuum
leaks.
