Subject: Re: [T2] cold start/thermo time debug

Hi Pete,

I would suggest you stick with the FI troubleshooting procedures in the 
Bentley Manual. If you don't have one of these it is the BEST 
investment a poor man can make in their bus. There is also an FI manual 
available at Richard Atwell's site at http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell.

According to the Bosch FI manual, this is what you should do:

1. Check electrical components: Distributor, coil, plugs, wires, dwell 
and timing.

2. Check valves, compression and oil pressure

3. Check all hoses for proper connection and good condition.

4. Check fuel pressure.

5. Check cold start valve &amp; TTS

6. Check Aux Air inlet valve

7. Check Air Flow Meter


The trick is to NOT SKIP stuff just because you &quot;know&quot; it's OK. Verify 
everything in proper order.


Happy trails,

&gt; Hey list...
&gt;   I've been dealing with this problem for quite awhile.  To start my
&gt; 2.0L FI, I have to give it gas and keep the engine revving or it will
&gt; die.  I have to do this the first time I start the bus for 2-5 minutes,
&gt; starting around 2500 - 3000 rpms until it will idle.  Once the engine
&gt; is warm, this problem goes away.  Sounds like either the cold start
&gt; valve or thermo-time switch to me.  Anyone agree with me or have some
&gt; other insight.  Can't afford to blindly replace those parts or pay to
&gt; have the problem diagnosed and fixed.
