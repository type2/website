&lt;&lt; Anyone know what happened to &quot; Muir's sound page&quot;?
I heard about this through the list,but,every link is a dud. I'm trying to 
figure if I
got a &quot;rod&quot; sound,or a &quot;wrist pin&quot;sound. (I think it's the pin).

I 'think' it's gone...I saved the link (and posted it occasionally to other
lists for fun and entertainment value), but it doesn't 'work' anymore...
