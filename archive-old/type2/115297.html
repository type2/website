Subject: RE: [T2] sliding tops

Sorry for the last broken link message

Try this

http://www.street-beat_dot_com/slidragtopvw.html

Look around the site, and you will get a good idea for what they have.


When I called a few years back, they said that theVW pop top  opening hole 
would have to have 'square' corners, not the rounded corners that are there. 
  That was the only mod needed.
