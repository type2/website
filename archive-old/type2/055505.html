Subject: Re: Cold Start Valve Malfunction Question...

Tom,
The #3 cylinder head temp sensor cannot physically operate the cold
start valve.  It just doesn't operate that way.  The head temp. sensor
feeds directly to the ECU.  And the ECU has absolutely nothing to do
with the operation of the cold start valve.  BUT, if the head temp
sensor did come loose, the ECU would see that infinite resistance as
super cold engine, and would go into a full-rich mode, which would drop
your gas mileage and cause all sorts of driveability problems.  That's
what happened to you.  Cold start valve had nothing to do with it
(unless it's leaking.

&gt; 
&gt; I remember having a problem about 6 months ago where the #3 cyl head temp
&gt; sensor wire came loose, and triggered the ColdStart Valve to operate, flooding
&gt; and shutting the motor down.  (replaced sensor).  I unplugged the CSV, and
&gt; Viola, no more problem. (Other than the shaking loosening up my fan and sheet
&gt; metal - if this happens to you, check all your bolts!!) So the problem is
&gt; solved, but I have no CSV now.
&gt; 
&gt; My question- What would cause the CSV to operate at the wrong time,
&gt; sporadically, other than the #3 temp. sensor?  Is this a sign my black box is
&gt; going?  Can they be rebuilt, or do they have to be replaced?  Is there a
&gt; checkout procedure for the black box to see if mine's OK or shot?  

The ECU has nothing to do with the operation of the cold start valve, as
I've said above.  The cold start valve receives 12v when the engine is
cranked, and if the engine is cold enough, it is GROUNDED by the
thermo-time switch, which lives under the air distribution box.  Power
to the CSV is CUT OFF when the starter stops cranking.  The cold start
valve does not and cannot be activated when the engine is running
(assuming non-fubared wiring).  It is possible for the cold start valve
to leak fuel (since it always sees fuel pressure) but then unplugging it
shouldn't make a difference.  

I'm not sure why unplugging your CSV solved the problem.  It shouldn't
have :-) .

Sean

&gt; TIA, Tom
