&gt;I ended up putting baling wire through the pin and doing a twistie number
to it to make sure it stays in place, but does anyone have a solution to
what this lag bolt is all about??

That is a mickey mouse set-up, isn't it?  I managed to get mine to work, but
I'm not happy with it because it leaves the pads loose.  I am thinking of
just putting a bolt all the way through and using a nyloc nut to keep it
tight.


&gt;Also, Grant, what did you mean, &quot;safety wire&quot; the set screw?

If you look at the head of the set screw you will see a hole going through
it.  This is so you can take some stainless steel wire, called safety wire,
run it through the head and around the shaft of the yoke, bring the wire
ends together and twist them tight.  This will keep the set screw from
coming loose on you when you're driving in the desert or other uninhabited
place.

There are safety wire pliers, which are one of mankind's better inventions.
You close the jaws on the wire ends, and slip a locking mechanism into
place, then you pull a little knob on the pliers and they spin, tightening
the wire ends into a neat spiral, which you then trim with the clipper edge
of the plier jaws.  Harbor freight sells them for around $10.  I also found
them very useful in reupholstering my front seats, but that's another story.
