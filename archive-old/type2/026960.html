Hello,
I've been having problems getting my brakes to bleed
good so I adjusted the rear shoes again and they were
still spongy afterward. So far I have bleed the brakes
2 times with a rear brake adjust between the bleeds.
All the brake hoses were just replaced and
the rear shoes are nice and thick at least 1/8 inch.

Since they wouldnt bleed I decided I'd remove
the brake drum and have a look at the works.
This was the first time I removed the drum and
it went pretty well, kind of nice I was thinking
I had to take the axle nut off but didn't.
There wasn't any fluid anywhere so I figured
the wheel cylinders weren't leaking. Just to make
sure I moved one of the rubber covers on the ends
of the wheel cylinder to the side and fluid came out.

I am assuming that its not supposed to be that way???

Well I'am going to try and pick up 2 new wheel
cylinder on thursday and replace them.
Is replacing the wheel cylinder just a straight
replacement or do I have to take the brakes
apart?

Well I made it to Michigan about a week and half ago.
Only had one kind of minor problem on the way ;)
Incase you don't remember I drove from Nashville, tn.
More to come on the trip soon..

thanks in advance for any advice I receive
