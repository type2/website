Dean,
    Hey the same thing happens to me in my bus!! And I even have the OEM
clock in the dash.  Sometimes I find myself tooling down the road turning
down the cd player so I can listen to the motor, birds chirp, or the wind.
Busses rule for this reason.


Time warp ahead Captain,

----- &gt; Is this only happening in my bus? Do I need to call &quot;Unsolved
Mysteries?&quot;
&gt; Just thought I'd ask. =^)
