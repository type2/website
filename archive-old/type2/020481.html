Subject: 68-73 Westy changes - I've got the parts manual
References: &lt;200101252258.OAA47800_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

I have a Westfalia parts manual that covers *every* part of the camper 
conversion from 68 through at least 72 - probably through the end of the 
sunroof-based models.  This thing is in German and covers every single 
screw, washer, and clip, including part numbers, and gives chassis 
numbers and dates for the changes.

Anyone else have one of these?  Bought it maybe 15 years ago at Manassas.

Longer-term listees may remember me handing out a few xeroxes of this a 
couple of years ago.  I can't offer to repeat that, but if I can find my 
spare xeroxed copy or if I get in the mood to do a sh*tload of scanning 
I'll pass it along to Scott for posting.

Meanwhile I'll be happy to look up details on changes as long as I don't 
get buried by requests.  As Raistrick points out, just 'cause the docs 
say a change took place doesn't mean your Westy will adhere to the 
specs.  Let me know what you need to know and tonite after happy hour 
I'll go out to the shop Mac, dial up, and hold forth.
