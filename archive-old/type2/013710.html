Subject: Re: [T2] My bus runs, with questions.....

&gt;   Ok so I have two questions.  The first one is:  What is the sensor 
&gt;that mounts near the back of the flywheel?  What does it do, and what 
&gt;happens when it hits the two little studs it's supposed to sense?

Timing but you'd have to own a late 70's VW computer to use it.  Well it
is just a hall sensor so I've always wondered if you could rig something.
Regardless it isn't important in todays world.  It doesn't actually hit the
little studs just senses the magnetic field they generate in its little coil.

&gt;   The second question:  My bus now makes a squeaking sound, all the 
&gt;time.  It seems to be coming from the clutch area, but I can't be sure.  
&gt;It's got a new clutch, and I took the engine apart and put in lots of 
&gt;new seals.  Anyone had this problem before, or know what it is?

Absolutely anything.  All the time all the time?  Clutch in, clutch out?

John
