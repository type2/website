Subject: '78 FI question

Greetings,

I'm STILL trying to diagnose a problem with my FI.  

My question this time 'round is:

1. Do the fuel injector units receive a CONSTANT voltage or are they
pulsed?  

2.  If they're constant, is it OK to swap the injector plugs between
cylinders?

3.  On the FI plug, should one wire be ground and the other power?
Is it &quot;a bad thing&quot; to have voltage on both wires of the plug?

Thanks!

Mark
