Subject: Re: [T2] Electrical Short 

Rae,

One thing at a time....  &quot;Divide and Conquer&quot;!!!!

So, I would say that the healight problem is more important and may &quot;help&quot;
cure the other problem.

First of all, you still didn't explain what &quot;missfire&quot; means to you.
AND **WHEN** does it happen???

OK, so if the bus keeps running after the ignition is turned off and key 
out(when lights are on), what happens when you turn the lights off...

does the engine stop then?

If it does, then you are feeding +12v to the coil(and maybe some other 
places) from the wrong places.

First, verify from Bentley that you have the correct wires going to 
the hot side of your coil.  How many and where do they come from?

By the numbers then....1976 FI engine in a 72 bus?...right?
This is gonna be a PITA cause the 72 was originally wired
really different than the later models.

3 sets of connectors on the coil.

Hi tension wire to distributor...

2 sets of push on spade lugs(one labeled &quot;1&quot; and one labeled &quot;15&quot;)

The one labeled 15 should have two wires going to it.
	The &quot;green&quot; wire to the points and a white/grey wire that
	goes into the Fuel injection harness over to to the ECU(brain).

The one labeled 1 is the one that gets 12 volts from the ignition switch.
	It should have 3 wires on it.

	1 wire goes to a round fuse connector and provides 12 volts 
		to the backup light switch.

	1 wire goes into a harness that goes to the double relay.

	1 wire goes all the way back to the front of the bus to the 
		fuse that gets 12 volts when you turn the key on.		

Remove any wires on the coil that don't match these and label them for 
later.  Remove the backup switch wire.  So now you should have excatly 
two wires on the #1 connector on the coil.  Start the bus.  Does it start?

If it starts, then turn the lights on and the ignition switch off.
Does it continue to run?  If so, then turn light off, does it quit?
Yes?...waay cool...sort of....means that the connector in front of the bus
is miss- wired .  Go pull the 12 volt wire off of the coil that comes from 
the front of the bus...the engine should die.



Let us know!

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; At this point, what does &quot;random missfire&quot;

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hi Dave,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm now looking at a short as a possible cause because
&gt; I've replaced the points 3 times last month (gaped and
&gt; timed one a week or so), replaced the spark plugs and
&gt; wires 2 times in the last month (just forked out big $
&gt; for Bosch pug wires) and STILL a missfire. I'm pulling
&gt; my hair out. So, I'm down to the wiring as my next
&gt; possible cause. I forgot to mention in my first post
&gt; (did in a reply) that I DO have a serious short
&gt; somewhere in my turn signals and head light wiring. So
&gt; strange fact that when the headlights are on and the
&gt; engine is running, If I turn off the ignition and pull
&gt; the key out my Rudy Bus still keeps going (engine
&gt; still runs)! So if it's causing the missfire I don't
&gt; know. But I gotta stop the 'headlight hotwiring' thing
&gt; that's going on. How very strange! Has anyone ever had
&gt; THIS happen? With headlights on and engine still runs
&gt; without the key??
