Easy there, Tiger. This is an international list about busses. Right or
wrong, there are lots of other forums for you to discuss your political
opinions.
Let's try to stay on topic, shall we?

&gt; &quot;No more old europe pomme frittes for me.
&gt; Im well stocked with FREEDOM FRIES(tm)&quot;
&gt;
&gt; You American imperialistic cowboys are disgusting.  Freedom Fries!  They
aren't french anyway.  We protest places that serve &quot;French&quot; Fries.  They
are no french.
&gt;
&gt; These are also disgusting:

&gt; You cowboys think that if our foreign policy is not driven by oil, we are
cowards or fools.  Our foreign policy is based on enlightened thinking.  We
support only countries that place a high priority on human rights, like
Iraq.  We don't allow our economic concerns, like our contracts with the
Iraqis to produce oil and our longtime contracts to supply planes, tanks,
and missiles to Iraq, to influence our policy.
&gt;
&gt; You think only of oil.  That is why you cowboys support Isreal and anger
the Arab oil producing countries.
