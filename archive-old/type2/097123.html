Subject: Winter in a VW Bus

Hi Folks,
    I offer for your enjoyment the following original poem that a I
wrote a few years ago.  Feel free to use it any way you like as long
as you give me credit for its creation.

Winter in a VW Bus
***************
Not a month before Christmas
and all cross the land,
bus owners are driving
with ice scrapers in hand.

They're scraping without
and they're scraping within,
to see where they're going
and where they've just been.

With a little warm air
that passes for heat,
we lose feeling in our fingers
our ears and our feet

So we put on our hats
our gloves and more sox,
endure the cold weather
in our German icebox.

Winter is long
and it's cold and it's dark,
but these buses we drive
have a place in our heart

Without a complaint
or hardly a care,
we wait for warm weather
summer to bear.
