&gt; &gt;I think the larger tube comes from the charcoal canister on the stock '72
&gt; &gt;engine (Type 4, US spec), but that in later FI buses the fumes from this
&gt; &gt;are reintroduced to the FI system. Is this correct? If not, can you tell
&gt; &gt;me how the larger tube connects into the venting system? I need to know if
&gt; &gt;I should plug it, leave it hanging, or in some way tie it back into the
&gt; &gt;venting system.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks for helping me vent! ;-) Joe
&gt; 
&gt; from what I understand on my '78 engine.
&gt; 
&gt; there's an air hose from the fan housing to the charcoal cannister.
&gt; 
&gt; from the other end (top) of the cannister, a smaller tube connects into
&gt; the evaporation jobbies in the air intake vents which then lead into the
&gt; 2 small 'vent' tubes into the tank.
&gt; 
&gt; this gives a slight positive air pressure in the tank when the engine is
&gt; running.
&gt; 
&gt; as far a I know, there's no fume recirculation going on on an FI engine
&gt; apart from the EGR.
&gt; 
&gt; -if I'm wrong.. please let me down gently; - then I'll go and fix my bus.

I think there should be 2 large hoses hooked to the carbon cannister: 1
in and 1 out! In comes from the fan housing, out goes to the air
cleaner. In operation this air flow sweeps the vapors from the carbon
pellets into the air cleaner where they are mixed with air and swept
into the manifold.
They get into the carbon cannister via the smaller tubing from the tank
vents.
