Subject: Re: [T2] needing a fan for my bus

I picked one up at the local RV store. It didn't, in fact, clamp to anything 
very well so I mounted it to the dash. Also, the ignition switch went out on 
one of the PO's and they put a replacement switch in the hole where the cig 
lighter used to be (I'm assuming, since I can't find a cig lighter but I 
have an ash tray). So I hard-wired the fan which only took about 15-20 
minutes. It's not AC but it's definitely better than nothing. Although, on a 
really hot day it's almost like sitting in front of a blow dryer! =^)

And what is good, Phaedrus,
And what is not good---
Need we ask anyone to tell us these things?
