Subject: Re: [T2] 78 Bay Drum Brake Q?

Find the parking brake adjuster nuts (and equalization bar)
at the forward end of the cables, inside the pedal cover.
There is no particular good reason to have removed that
pin(except that it worked :). You should know how to adjust
the parking brake correctly.
