Subject: CA - Smog II info, looking for source

I'm starting to worry about getting my '76 bus smog legal here in CA. 

When I purchased it earlier this year, I registered it as a 
non-operational vehicle with the hope of getting it up and running as 
funds became available. I haven't fully checked it out yet, but I vaguely 
remember the PO telling me that it had a '79 FI engine in it, rather than 
the original stock '76 FI engine.

I've heard that under Smog II you are required to smog the car with the 
engine that came in your car. In other words, I wouldn't be able to 
switch back to a '76 engine and I would be required to meet the smog laws 
set for a '79 vehicle rather than a '76 vehicle.

What I'd prefer to do is tell the DMV that I purchased the vehicle 
without an engine, and then at my leisure after fixing up the body, just 
put the correct year engine into my bus.

I guess my question is, does anyone know of a complete reference on Smog 
II that will help me to interpret/understand some of the issues that I'll 
face in getting my bus up and running? I don't want to go to a referee 
right away, I just want to know what to expect.

Thanks,

Bren
