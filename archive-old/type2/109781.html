Subject: '73 AIR CONDITION FOR SALE

I removed the entire air conditioning system (overhead style) from my 
73 bay for restoration and do not want to re-install it.  I live in CT 
along the coast and would rather have the better mileage.  It is 
complete with compressor, both condensors, evaporator, and all the 
hoses. I bough the bus as a basket case so cannot say if it works but 
other than the hoses being a littke dry it is certainley servicable.
I would like to get $100 plus shipping costs to offset the money I owe 
my Dad for the restoration.
I live in Ledyard CT about midway between NYC and Boston.  It could be 
shipped in multiple boxes by UPS or I'd crate it for common carrier.
