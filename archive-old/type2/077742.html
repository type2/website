 UH, don't our buses get just about as poor gas mileage as those SUV's?
 Ok, some of these monstrosities get about 8 mpg (I hope I'm exaggerating but 
probably not)
 but that is the extreme.  If we're lucky, we get 20.  Better than 8, but not 
too good.  
 But I don't drive my bus for the gas mileage, I drive it because it has 
style.

It's the manufacturing of the vehicle that probably creates the most 
pollution,
so not creating (blank) numbers of other vehicles since '72 puts it way ahead 
of the game.
