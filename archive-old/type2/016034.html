Subject: Steering box for '70 Westy

X-Envelope-To: type2

I have a 1970 Westy that is in great shape - no rust! Of course the door and
window rubber is old and cracking and the interior is somewhat trashed but
the mechanics and body couldn't be better except for the steering problem. 
Replaced the ball joints and shocks, greased up everywhere there was a
fitting, checked all the linkages and tightened up the steering box (maybe a
little too tight) and I still have some front end floating or wandering once
I get to 40+ mph. Could it be I need a new/rebuilt steering box? I read
somewhere that tight ball joints could cause this kind of problem too or am
I taking the bait? 
Any how if I need a steering box what would you folks recommend as a
trustworthy vendor that sells reliable steering boxes that have been
properly reconditioned/rebuilt with proper and substantial bushings etc. I
have heard stories about some suppliers with poor rebuild and quality
control. Sure would appreciate the collective knowledge and experience from
the group.
Bill
