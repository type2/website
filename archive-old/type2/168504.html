Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Update on 78 FI with Pertronix not starting

Thanks, JT. Good points (pun not intended). I think we will try to keep the
stock wiring, unless I have an ignition switch that is going south. I don't
really want to open up that can of worms.

&gt;  Before you do anything else, give Petronix a call and ask a tech what the
&gt; nominal voltage is to keep from damaging your ignitor.  Whenever I'm working
&gt; with electrical other than ignition, I disconnect the hot wire to the coil,
&gt; you can fry your ignitor if you don't.  I would also recommend that if you
&gt; have a 009 handy to keep it as a spare with points and condensor and
&gt; hold-down bracket allready timed, just pop in and keep going
&gt; If you set up a seperate relay, be sure it's continuous duty, like the
&gt; relay for a Westie aux battery.  IMHO, finding the problem with the stock
&gt; harness is your best and cheapest bet.  When wires fail it is generally at
&gt; the exposed ends, not in the middle of the harness, barring external damage
&gt; from road debris or wrecks.  If you soldered [SIC?] in a section of new wire
&gt; from the wire bundle to the coil in the engine compartment with new ends I
&gt; bet the problem would go away.
&gt;
&gt; Also, don't forget to spin your fuses!
