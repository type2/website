Subject: Torque to spin unbroken engine

It takes ~22ft.lbs (at the hardest spot) on the pulley nut to turn my
1600 engine with new cylinders and pistons. Spark plugs are torqued
all around.

This is before break-in (the engine was never fired so far). I can
hear those rings pushing quite hard on the cylinder walls. Rings
cylinders were generously oiled when installed.

The 20 ft.lbs is without fan belt attached.

22ft.lbs feels like a lot compared to before and I worry that I did
something wrong. Before the pistons/cylinders were installed, the
crankshaft assemblt and rods turned super smooh (of course).

Key turning time or dismantling time ??

Thanks -- Arnaud
