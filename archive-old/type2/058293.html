   You're probably right -- I've got a dial indicator gauge, but what
stopped me from getting one apart before was the VW231/15 tool to take
out the adjusting rings -- tried a makeshift one, but couldn't get it --
and I'd also need at least the VW 381/14 for the retaining ring on the
pinion bearing. Most of the other stuff looks like something could be
rigged. Not that it's be a &quot;professional&quot; job, of course, but &quot;good
enough&quot; as long as the ring and pinion was reasonably close. 
   Anyway, the tool prices I've seen thus far make it pretty
impractical, unless someone was selling used stuff.
