&gt; My question is.. is this a normal occurrence in wet weather? Or do I have a
&gt; big problem to worry about?  I had the brakes done about 4000 miles ago.. so
&gt; I would assume they are in good shape.

Nick:
Not uncommon at all in long term storage. Clutches too, seem to adhere
to the p.plate, rust on, actually.
Also, sometimes the parking brake cables get rusty and fail.(At least
here in rust heaven) Sometimes reaching under and giving the offending
cable a few tugs will coax the inner part loose. (Splitties had grease
zerks on the cables- what a concept!)(Oh, maybe a holdover from
mechanical brakes- used on standard beetles til 51 or so?)
