Subject: Re: [T2] Anyone got a rpm limiting rotor?

&gt; Looking for a 5400 or 5800 rev limiting rotor. Does anyone have one they'd
&gt; like to sell?

These are truely hard to find. As far as I know they are NLA. The trouble
is that it is a part that wears out, so there are even fewer of these than
anything else.

I found one on *-bay some time ago for about $30 bucks. I haven't seen one
lately though. I put it on when my wife drives the bus, as she is not very
good with  a stick yet, but is learning. I am unfortunately for you, not
interested in parting with it.

Good luck finding one. If you find a reliable source, I am sure that many
of us would love to know about it. THough you may want to order yourself a
bunch before telling us. ;)
