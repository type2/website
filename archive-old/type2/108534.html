&quot;...Is there any downside to registering the bus as an antique in PA?  Here
in
Georgia it's mostly just the cost of the plate ($80.00).  There doesn't seem
to be any restrictions to go along with the antique status here....&quot;

Registering a vehicle as an antique or classic here imposes rather severe
limitations on use of the vehicle.  The law reads something like...&quot;limited
to driving to and from parades and shows and the occasional maintenance
drive&quot;.  I think they define maintenance drive as once a week, but they
don't specify how many miles.

I do not have my bus registered as an antique or classic, to avoid any
issues with the local constabulary.
