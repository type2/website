Subject: Back-up Light Wiring

Hey guys,

     I'd like to bounce this off you guys just to make sure I understand this
correctly. There is a REVERSE switch attached to the transmission with TWO
wires coming off of it.

What I'd like to know is, is this reverse switch basically just a regular old
switch? Does that switch complete the circuit between the two wires that come
off of it?

If that's the case, then that would mean that ONE of those wires would need to
connect to a positive source while the other would connect to the &quot;Y&quot; that
goes to the back-up tail-lights.

Am I correct in understanding this?

If I understand that correctly, then would the positive on the COIL be an
acceptable positive source for the back-up wire?


I know that question may seem trivial, but when I get back there and look at
all those wires, it makes my head spin. And replacing all the wiring from
scratch takes a toll on your brain when you've never done it before.


Oh! One other question, I noticed there is a second switch on the
transmission. I had been told that this switch is OPEN when the car is in 4th
gear. What would be the purpose of that switch? Nothing seems to be connected
to it, and I don't see anything about it in the Bentley manual?


Thanks!

Todd
