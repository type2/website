Subject: Re: [T2] bench seat in a bus

&gt; Anyone ever installed a 2/3 1/3 bench seat in a 73 bus replacing the
&gt; front single seats?  Will this work? How much modification would be
&gt; necessary?
&gt; Thanks for any input.

VW did this in non-walkthru bay buses. The drivers seat is the same as a
walk thru. The pass 2/3 is like a split 2/3 but it pivots in the middle. The
split 2/3 is a solid frame. You would need to build a pedestal to support it
in the walk thru section....
