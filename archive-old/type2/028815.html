&gt; After my order didn't arive after 10 days I called and asked if it had
been shipped
&gt; yet. He wouldn't tell me one way or the other if it had or not


The only reason why someone &quot;wouldn't&quot; tell you if your order had shipped
would be if you called the 800 orders-only number instead of customer
service - in which case the person indeed would not tell you, because they
simply wouldn't know!
