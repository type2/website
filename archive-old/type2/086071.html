Subject: NEW engine cases

  My supplier just got in a supply of NEW ALUMINUM engine cases, These are
made by Auto Linia in Brazil.
  For those of you that were at VW Drag Days and/or Pomona you saw these
there. I will do a list special and offer these for $300.00 dollars and
include SHIPPING in the lower 49 states. This will be THIS WEEK only if they
last that long. I have not built an engine using these yet, but am going to
build a stroker this week (as soon as I'm done with the one I'm building
now). The test engine built using this case has performed flawlessly.
  The materials used in this case as supposedly the same as a type 4 case
and should last forever. I will post pics this week


ronnie   just passing it on.

ps. I have sold out of the 62-71 tail light assemblies for $35.00 a pair and
am trying to get more to keep the offer going.
 tanks to all for your support
