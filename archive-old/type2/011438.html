By the way!

I just submitted an E mail titled Flashing Oil Light/ Hesitation/ yikes 
And I then went out to the bus and started it up and pulled the wires off 
one at a time.  I'm running on three cylinders. #4 is out of commision. I 
replaced the plug and the wire with no difference. Is this a stuck valve?
The compression is o.k. at 100 in high altitude on that cylinder same as 
the others. What's the story.

Thanks in advance for any advice!
