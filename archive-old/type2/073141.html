Subject: Single-Vac Type IV Diz into Type I?
Message-Id: &lt;v03110706b3ada1508d77_at_[209.214.192.183]&gt;

So I'm trying to put this single vacuum distributor that Marv Krupps was
nice enough to send me onto the 64 with the 71 powerplant. Currently the
bus has a 009 on it (a CHROME one!).

Steve Dolan took a look at this diz and said it was a Type IV one, so it
probably is. Yeah I know it won't have the three degrees retard in #3.

The problem is that I can't align the distributor right because the vacuum
biscuit runs into the fuel pump and I think it would run into the manifold
too. This bus has an alternator, so different fuel pump than stock, I don't
know if that makes a difference.

Has anybody run into this before? Electric fuel pump? Abandon the distributor?
