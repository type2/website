Subject: Oil plate studs
Message-ID: &lt;2b2e50c6.247c1aad_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Volks... my first post to the list, previous posts have been pmail...

my problem... last night, about a half a block from home, I lost one of the 
small stud bolts that hold the oil plate to the bottom of my 1600 DP.  The 
way I noticed was the shiny sheen on the wet street as I was backing into my 
driveway and the long black streak of oil coming from under the front of my 
bus....no oil light came on, so it hadn't happened but moments before.  
Between getting out of the bus and running back and look, I had lost most of 
my oil.  Went to the local hardware store and got a new 6mm by 23mm stud 
bolt, and correct nylock nut.

My question... how should I install the stud bolt?  Just thread it in and put 
on the nut? Or, somehow (Locktite, JB Weld) coat the stud and let it harden 
into the sump before putting on the nut?  And, any ideas as to why it came 
out in the first place?

Really glad that I have been building good bus Karma.... Lhiannon was very 
kind to have a problem so close to my driveway.... she was lovingly prasied 
for her kindness.

Thanks for any info y'all might offer.
