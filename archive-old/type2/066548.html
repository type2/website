Subject: all about me is the subject!

Sorry about that, everyone.  I am such a dumbie.

I am a 19 year old college sophomore studying Sociology, Education (want 
to eventually start my own Montessori school), and Math.  I have had my 
bus for almost three years- I inherited her, brown and brown, from my 
older sister who had in turn inherited her six years earlier from my 
mom.  When I was in elementary school, I caused the front passenger door 
to fall off (wasn't closed all the way when my mom backed up and it got 
ripped off by the carport support- thank God the carport stayed up!) so 
I know a lot of the history even though I am pretty young.  I have lots 
of pictures up on my web page and encourage y'all to go there (many of 
you already have) and see the different stages of Hildegarde's 
transformation from stock and icky to not stock and very personal and 
expresssive.  So forget all those messages without subjects please!!
