Subject: Tach Solution Found

So I just got off the phone with VDO Tech support. Found the problem with the 
tach I couldn't get to work: Their instructions for setting the DIP switches 
are a &quot;faux pas&quot; as the tech guy put it. Here is how you are supposed to set 
it for 4 cyl. operation. Looking at the back of the tach, with the DIP 
switches in the upper left hand corner. The far left switch needs to be in 
the up position. The middle switch needs to be in the up position. The far 
right switch needs to be in the down position. VDO says that a great many 
tachs went out with the instructions for setting the switches printed 
backwards. It figures. They blamed the people they out-sourced the printing 
to. Sound familiar? Hope this helps.
