&gt; How much of a PITA is it to put a F.I. engine from a
&gt; 79 bus into a 72 bus? How much stuff is associated
&gt; with the FI that would have to be transplanted? How
&gt; easy is it to re-wire the FI engine into the 72 bus?
&gt; Can the FI brain simply be transplanted and connected
&gt; to 12 volts in the 72 bus or is it MUCH more involved
&gt; than that?

tis a bit of work, need to get FI gas tank (or modify the existing tank)
what I have done with the older 1700, 1800 engines is use the FI from a
type IV sedan or wagen, more avaliable, cheaper  (71/72 411 was 1700,
73/74 412 was 1800) these are different types of FI so get all the parts,
it is not interchangable with the 2liter bus FI.
