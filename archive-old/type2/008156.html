Subject: EGR search + Type 34 Karmann found.

Gotta start with the bus content...

I was doing my monthly search for my '78 EGR switch which was unusually 
fast due to the cold and the fact that there have been no new busses for 
ages.

I couldn't decide wether it was good or bad that there were no new busses 
on the yard...maybe it's just that time of year; I know the selection 
will dry up eventually just like the splitties, but not yet! please!

But my most amazing find was this really rare Karmann type 34.  It had 
the year 1960 painted on the side, IMHO it would only make a good parts 
car, but if it's rare enough, it's restorable..(not much rust on it 
anyway.)
 
-it's in Fairfield, CA if anyone's interested.
