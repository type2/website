Subject: Shift rod bushings

Hi All,

According to the Hayes that came with the '77 bus, it's necessary to 
drop the engine/transmission just to change the rear shift rod bushing. 

Is that the only way, or is there a method I can use that doesn't 
involve investing so much time and effort?  

I hate sloppy shifting.

Shad H.
