Subject: bucking engine

Hi

What are the symptoms of driving on a draining/drained battery, versus a 
more severe engine problem? Situation: I've got a '78 transporter with a 
type IV motor - don't know what the cylinder compressions are in it.

I made a 150 mile drive, knowing I have a weak alternator. (The local NAPA 
tested it - although I suppose it could be the voltage regulator as well.) 
About 125 miles into it, the bus started a slight hesitation which quickly 
developed into coughing and sputtering. I did manage to limp home, but I was 
coasting down hills wherever posible. I was driving without lights, radio or 
wipers to save on electricity.

I'd had the battery fully charged, and I know it's a good battery.

I'm trying to prepare myself for what I may have done to the engine, and how 
I'm going to proceed from here.

Thanks
