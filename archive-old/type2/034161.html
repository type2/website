Subject: re lowering engine

Mike Benthin here from daughter's computer:
In my 71 bus, I'd lower the engine and trans together unitil trans rested on 2
stacked concrete blocks.  No need to remove front shift rod- the flex coupling
has enough play to allow the distance I used.  This made it easy to reach upper
bolts of engine; your 72 has no engine access upper hatch either-  But when they
went to mounting up the trans by its own hanger, then it's harder.  FWIW, in my
78, it does clear to pull the engine without touching trans- but be SURE the
engine is parallel to the ground as you pull the jack back- ie, if you lift the
rear (ramps, or pieces of 2 2x6 boards nailed together etc), then lift the front
to match!  All I need to remove is the oil filler pipe.  MB 78 Westy 211,000 mi
on one engine.
