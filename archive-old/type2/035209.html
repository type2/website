Subject: Administrivia, Various Threads

Hello all,

Been a fairly low key admin this week.  I'm not even minding the $4000 Bus
thread, you guys have done pretty good at keeping it to a dull roar and not
turning it into a flame fest so I'm happy.  Keep it cool.

On the Jeep thing, please let that die, I really don't need a VW vs. Jeep
thread starting, everyone on this list knows what is better so you'd all be
preaching to the choir anyway ;-)
