&gt; Has anybody ever gone to Mexico and brought back a bus from Mexico as they
&gt; are still in production down there? I realize that we have Emissions and
&gt; other legalities to worry about but, if it can be done with the beetle, why
&gt; not the bus?

take a late model builders plate to Mexico, buy the bus and get  papers to
Canada, when you get to the border, get transhipment papers to pass
through to Canada..

   register it in Canada, then sell it to some American who happens to
drive it back.._dot_can you say &quot;grey market&quot;

it still would need to be registered as a 78 or even earlier so it won't
need to pass smog testing, because there is probably no way it could

  You will probably still be advised to swap some of the more obvious
things like headlights etc...

  I of course know nothing about this, but I hear the jails in Canada have
better food than Mexico
