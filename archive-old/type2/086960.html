&gt; Hi ya'll,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm hoping to buy an air-cooled VW bus soon. Tired of
&gt; taking the city bus all the time! Can anyone recommend
&gt; the best year to look for, and/or someone to check it
&gt; out and/or do a bit of repair/resto if it needs it. I
&gt; would ideally like to find a power blue one with a
&gt; pop-top in excellent condition. I don't think I'll
&gt; need any of that sink and stove stuff though. It seems
&gt; that that stuff is just more stuff to break down. I
&gt; know this might be a bit much to find, but I'm keeping
&gt; my hopes up.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Terry
