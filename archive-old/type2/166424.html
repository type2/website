I too think this is the best way for non-electronic cars.  You set the advance at the point where it is most critical, especially for air-cooled engines in heavy  vehicles i.e a bus.
    I find my digital timing light to have been a revelation for tuning, especially when I help someone who pulls up with a &quot;random&quot; make and model from the past.  I bought mine, some used off-brand unit, ten years ago and it's the first thing I pull out when someone asks for help.  Usually TDC is marked boldly on a pulley and some info can be found about the vehicle specs.  If no specs, (1) set it to 30 degrees total-at full centrifugal advance rpm with vacuum disconnected from dizzy, i.e. rev the engine until the ignition just stops advancing, (2) reconnect vacuum- adjust the idle rpm to 750 RPM, air bleed to best idle-these two are interrelated. This will get them back to work on Monday and for the next year. 10 minutes, tops  

    Of course, if you have the correct tuning spec, and the vehicle is in stock configuration for that spec, then use it.  jon

Why not just tach it up and set total timing?  If it's hitting 30 at 2500 rpm
then you can set the idle where it's comfortable with it and it shouldn't go
below 7.5.  I only set initial timing static before startup and once it's
running I set total and call it good.

&quot;While there is lead in the air,
there is still hope&quot;.
