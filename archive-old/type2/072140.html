&gt;email all surveys to
&gt;me...rasdave


To all potential surveyors, I ask:  please include the &quot;Back channel&quot;
request, or at least request that surveys (on list ones) begin and end on
Fridays.

Sorry to sound cranky, but I subscribe to this list to get info. on VW
busses, not on the statistical aspects of the western world.... and things
have been a little bit clogged lately....

Thanks for letting me vent.... have a good rolling Friday, everyone!
