Subject: doublecab gasket availability

hi - i am wondering whether a certain 68+ rear cab door gasket is still
available for a doublecab. it is the gasket that lives on the chassis,
across the bottom of the door. this is not ON the door; it is below the
floor and above the rocker. i crosspost this in case the splittie crew
knows whether it is the same on their cargo doors, and can be cut to the
length i need which is 22.5 inches. or perhaps it is the same length in the
pre68 doublecabs.
BIGthanks - steve
