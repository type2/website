i live in dallas, and i use the alternative route method...sticking to the
back roads and side streets, taking the roads less traveled...i have special
'bus routes' for all the places i normally go. i don't use these routes when
driving my my non-bus vehicle. they take longer, but it sure is a lot less
aggravation.

if someone gives me a problem anyway, well, whatever. me and my bus are doing
the best we can. if they want to go faster than i am, they'll just have to go
around.
