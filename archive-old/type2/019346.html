Subject: Cooling a '70 Westfalia

I have a defective auto mechanic gene and could use some help.  I just
bought a '70 Westfalia because it was rust free and the engine was
supposed to have been rebuilt.  I would like to fix the interior and
keep this running for as long as I can (10 years+).  Now I find that
this was the year before the doghouse oil cooler (my usual great
hindsight).  I read conflicting opinions on how to most effectively keep
the engine cool.  What are the thoughts of the experts out there on the
following ideas?
1. adding a full flow oil filter.
2. adding a 1 1/2 qt. oil sump.
3. adding a doghouse oil cooler (is this possible?).
4. ?
Pros or cons on any of these.  Any other ideas?
