Subject: Re: [T2] HELP! I need a 2L long block

I've got a good used 2L for $390 the ad is on type2
and ep_dot_com. Unfortunately you would have to get me the
money within 36 hours so I can cancel the &quot;vanagon
engine&quot; auction elsewhere. The engine is out of an 80
Westy and got 23 mpg, but dripped oil from push rod
tubes.

&gt; Hello list,
&gt; My good friend just blew up his 2L engine in his 76
&gt; Westy.  I am looking to find him a GOOD rebuild or
&gt; an STRONG running used motor.
