Hey Folks,

I am new to the list so please allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Andy and I just purchased a 1976 Westy with the intention of
repairing what I hope to be minor(haha)rust problems. My folks had a 67
campmobile which was our only family vehicle for 11 years. My earliest
memories of childhood revolve around that bus and the blue vinyl interior.
We even had a potty training seat for my younger brother.
I had a 71 bug for about six months in the eighties and I had possession of
(no title) a 67 camper for the better part of a year (also in the eighties).
If I knew then what I know now!!Early nineties found me with a headache in
the form of an 81 bus from Mexico. Many sad breakdowns and title heartaches
later I sold her at huge loss. I guess I can't help myself.
Anyway, I searched the archives and could find no definitive answer for a
few questions.

1.What is the general consensus on sway bars?pros/cons?

2.&quot;                                                      &quot; aftermarket
oilcoolers.

3.is there an easy way to replace the screen in the poptop(the canvas is in
great shape,of course the screen is decayed beyond belief)?


Thanks,
Andy   76 Westy
