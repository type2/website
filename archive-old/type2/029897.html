&gt; [...] While you're lubricating the assembly at the rear take a close look at
&gt; it.  There's a plastic guide piece that introduces slop in the system when

&gt; part is available from WCM for about $10. 

Well, I don't know... I sure do *wish* that the loaf slider block was
available, and if anyone has seen one, let me know!  but at the present
time, I think all that is available is the Vanagon slider block.  

A lot of places advertise that they have the blocks and that they fit
'68-90, but what they have is the vanagon block. It sure does fit '80-90,
but it sure as heck does *not* fit '68-79 :-( The loaf has a straight rail
that the block rides on, the vanagons have a rolled rail.  The cutout in
the loaf slide would be a slot, the cutout in the vanagon block is a
semi-circle. While installing a Vanagon block is better than letting the
carriage flop about in there, it isn't right :-(

As a result, Larry's advice to lube that rail is even more critical.  In
addition, look at the condition of the rail itself.  If the paint is
peeling and the metal is rusty, it is gonna *eat* your worn-but
functional, NLA block alive!
