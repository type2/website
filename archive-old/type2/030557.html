hello all,

the bus fallout last weekend was quite a success! i had meant to write
this last week but life intruded.

We had a few more busses than last year a total of 14 VW &amp; 1 1954 GMC
hippie schoolbus. That thing was great, nothing like bringing your wood
panneled living room with you! Community breakfast was in there sunday AM.
(the breakdown: 1 eurovan, 4 vanagons, 2 baywindows, 7 splitties and the
gmc.)

As with last year it was a relaxed weekend of talking about busses, eating
good food and the ubiquitous trip to wally world on staurday to see the
sights and buy what you forgot ;)

We have electronic pictures and the webpage is in the works... i will post
again when we have the pictures up.

The farthest away atendee was from new mexico.  The newest bus was an EV,
the oldest (vw) bus was mine, but i gave oldest bus to the 54
schoolbus.  Rustiest bus was me, and longest distance went to ED.  We
didnt really have awards though, we were just &quot;givin props to our
peeps&quot; hehe. I think next year i may give out a couple of awards just for
fun :)

take care,

Steve
