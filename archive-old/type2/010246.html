Subject: Generator, the return. . .

	So my generator gave out last week.  So I ordered up
a new one that arrived thursday, took friday off of
work, pulled engine, changed generator, put engine
back, cleaned up and ready to go with plenty of friday
afternoon to enjoy.  Tested everything, looked good
and away I went.  Drove about 10 miles, stopped the
car, and the generator light was blaring at me again. 
So I went and double checked everything and decided
the regulator was shot.  Disconnected the battery and
left it overnight at my friends house.
	Saturday went to retrieve the bus, since it was
parked on the street and had to be moved, I hooked up
the battery, no red light.  So I thought that was an
odd, but pleasant suprise.  Started it up.  Now the
red light is on with the engine running rather than
with the key off.   So, thinking that its just
something screwy I drive home.	
	I retraced everything I had done on friday, and it
still checked out.   So I gave up, confident that it
was a bad regulator.  
	Today I got one, installed it and was ready to ride
off on my merry way.  Started up, RED LIGHT, but this
time as soon as I rev the engine it goes out.  So in a
fit of frustration I drive off to the local VW
mechanics/parts place I get parts from and asked them
to look at it.  Hook it up, generator shot.  Lasted
less than 20 miles, and it was a Volkswagen generator,
straight out of the box.  It was working friday the
first time I started the car, tested it with a meter. 
All was fine.  Next time I stopped it, whack all hell
breaks loose.
	So now, I have to put another one in, at least the
other one was still under warranty. . . :)
	Could there possibly be something that fries a
generator like that, or was just a bad one to begin
with?
