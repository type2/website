Subject: Re: [T2] rapid response to low oil-P

&gt; Remember I mentioned the Gas Guzzler Tax?
&gt;
&gt; CAFE [corporate average fuel economy] figures into each model brought in. Asian cars have never had a problem
&gt; with it. Euro cars have a big problem with it.

Not surprising, since the Euros insist upon importing only their
largest and most expensive models.  Even with their most expensive models
they import few Diesel-engined models that would fix their CAFE averages.
