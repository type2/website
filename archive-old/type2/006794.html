Subject: 71 parts
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

Gentlepersons-
                       Sorting out the remains of a frame-rusted 71 Bus. So 
far,
steering wheel and shaft down to the flex coupling, including ignition lock
and key, complete plastic dash and top steel (surface rusted). More to
come...I'm in Northern NJ (East Orange, near Newark), as a geographic 
reference...Also some 59 TR 3A parts, just in case you're multi-marqued.

Tony in NJ
