Subject: Re: [T2] Popping out of gear

&gt;I took a look at a '73 Westy today, and have a newbie question:
&gt;The engine purrrs like a kitten, but the transmission pops out of gear in 
&gt;1st,
&gt;and grinds going into 3rd. Diagnosis? What is involved in the repair?

I'm sure most of the list will agree that they tranny will need to be 
rebuilt....a cheaper solution would be to find one out of a bus that is 
being parted out.

Good luck.
