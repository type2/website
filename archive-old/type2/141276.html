&gt; I checked the timing, etc. all okay. Oh, couldn't find the correct 
&gt; condenser (scarce as hens' teeth, anymore,) had to retrofit a wells 579 or 
&gt; something but it doesnt mate to the side of the distrib like the correct 
&gt; one.

so,, ass/u/me ing...   you have a 78 with cal efi ,, including the cal 
ignition ... and you installed a suspect condensor......  ah.. yep, that is 
my first guess.
again.. assuming  &lt;yes Mark ,, I know! lol&gt;  you DID ground the condesor ... 
as that makes a big difference.
I spent a lot of time with a fellow ....trying to get his problem figured 
out.... ended up finding out he had used a plastic cable tie to hold the 
condensor to a plug wire.

Can you send more information,, like actual timing instead of .. it is ok...
have you attempted a tune up...

adjust valves.
compression check
new plugs , if required  ,  I am assuming there are no points... so you 
can't adjust dwell on the cal dist &lt;i have no experience here&gt;
adjust timing
check vacuum

Test drive....
maybe it is your coil,, they are notorious for some of those symptoms

Hope that helps!
