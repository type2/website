Subject: push rod tubes

As far as I know  withmy experience with the 83 vanagon...the push rod tubes
will come out without removing the heads....I think you have to remove the
little wire retaining spring clips first.  From underneath, remove the sheet
metal, then grasp the tubes with a vice grip set to just barely hold.. Wiggle
and push toward the head.  They come out pretty easily but at first it may seem
tough... John Jensen in Annapolis...
