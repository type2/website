Subject: Who to rebuild heads?

I'm gonna want to have a set of 1800cc heads rebuilt. I've heard it's 
best to have someone familiar with T4 engines do the heads. I don't 
know.

Can anyone reccommend a place to do this job? What stuff should I 
have done to the heads to prevent valve seat problems I've &quot;heard&quot; 
that T4 engines have? What kind of prices am I looking at?

Any info appreciated. I'm trying to learn as much as possible about 
T4 heads before I spend money.
