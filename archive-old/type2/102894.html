Subject: Re: [T2] More 1968 Minutia

David,

That is an interesting story. I can only imagine the size of the 
balls it takes to be a snotty stuck up bay-window driver at Jerome :)

Most of the high tops that we see around the US are in fact camper 
conversions like you and I have. There were also some Euro 
aftermarket high tops for campers and emergency vehicles. I could be 
wrong but my understanding is that the VW that came from the factory 
as high tops had fiberglass roofs after about 11/67(1968 model year). 
There were two flavors. One had an extended height slider door such 
as the examples below.

I can't tell from the camera angle if the buses below are regular 
height slider doors but the bus on the left has a decent view of the 
bulkhead.

 From the www.type2_dot_com library and the EXCELLENT work of Vincent Molenaar
here are the M codes in question

515	High roof deliv. van with extend. slid. roof		211
516	F -- 211 2065 217				211,214
	F -- 211 2065 217				231,234

If anyone has any definitive info about the material for the VW 
factory high roofs please share it with us.

Thanks
