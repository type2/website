Subject: Re: [T2] bad buyer

Nope, you're not nuts. Well, sorta nuts for selling it ;)

I'm the 5th owner of my bus, it's been through 2 motors, but 2 sets of
P&amp;C, and 2 heads on this block.  The PO documented *everything* he did,
which is good and gives me a solid knowledge of what was done to the bus
(or not done) before I got it.  I'm keeping a book of my own that
details what I've done to it.  Right next to that is a &quot;wish book&quot; of
things I plan to do to it.  ;) 

I can guarantee if you sold the bus to that lady, she'd be calling you
all the time to complain that something is wrong, and she doesn't know
what it is, and you need to fix it because it shouldn't have been wrong
when she bought the bus (despite a $2,900 pricetag).  

She'd be better off in a Toyota. 

Just my $.02
