Subject: Re: [T2] Chicago VW Resources and 77 Seat Upholstry kit
  questions

Abraham,

Yes, they are difficult...you need a friend to help and you need 
everything to be ***very*** warm.  Summertime is actually best for this.

Push, pull, tug, squeeze down on the seat at the front and you will
eventually get there.  Maybe a hair drier on low to help the vinyl stretch 
a little.  Did some on my 78 and they weren'tall vinyl, but non stretching 
cloth....even harder than pure vinyl to get to stretch..

Oh, and some good hand strength helps.

I suppose you could take them to any local upholstery shop to get help if 
you had to.  My local upholstery place was very knowledgeable about TMI 
products.

Let's hope that they didn't send you the wrong thing!...something they 
have been know for in the past...your local upholstery shop will know.

Glad to have you back on the list!

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hello, I used to be active on this list (about 97-01) but have been on a
&gt; long hiatus. I've just moved to Chicago and have 2 questions:

&gt;  2) The 77 seat cover kit (front seats only) that I'm trying to install is
&gt; EXTREMELY hard to work with. I honestly can't see how any human being could
 get the bottom part to fit (the seat back was a 30 min job, no problem).
 Whereas earlier years use wires and hog rings and hooks, the 77 seats use
 plastic strips that have to fit into little pockets around the base of the
 seat I had no trouble getting the longer strip into the grove (this accounts
 for the front and both sides), but I feel like the vinyl is about 1-3 inches
 too short to ever fit into the back part. 


I've tried all sorts of ways to
&gt; compress the springs in the seat, but even when they are bottomed out I'm
&gt; still a good 1/2 - 1 inch away from the grove. I spoke with a helpful guy at
snipped

&gt; -- I'm working in my small apartment and have very little free time to
&gt; devote to this, and I'm stuck. Is it possible to mail these seats to someone
&gt; and have the kit installed? Is there a different kit that is easier to
&gt; install? Any suggestions at all?
