Subject: Re: [VB] lube it or just go at it dry?

&gt; looking into putting together the 36hp motor for the 57, and I've run into
&gt; two different schools of thought. Builder number one(factory trained in
&gt; germany many years ago when 25/36hp was what there was) says to oil the
p's
&gt; and c's when assembling the motor, builder number two(many years
experience
&gt; building stock and race motors, one of the few local builders who's work
has
&gt; a good rep) says that oiling them helps make an oil burner out of your
motor
&gt; and that they are best left dry. Opinions?

Ronnie-
I have built alot of VW motors and have been a diesel mechanic for 21 years.
I have never, ever put a piston in a cylinder dry. Every piston put in a VW
cylinder has been oiled and never once has a motor burned oil. In fact i
have a motor in my garage I built from scraps I had around. Honed the
cylinders, new rings and well oiled piston assy. when I reassembled it. Put
it in a bug and sold it to a friend. Her first bug and ran it for 5 years.
It had an oil leak( after 5 years) so I swapped it out for another I had.
After all was done it was the oil pressure switch leaking. And it never
smoked.  Lube it for life!
