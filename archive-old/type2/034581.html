Subject: Shoephone's bus

I'd just like to say a few things about your Volkswagen.

Who gave you a Volkswagen?  Did anyone ever tell you you're supposed to
change the oil every 700 miles, or whenever it starts to look dirty?
And check it every morning?

    Also, Volkswagens DO NOT go 90 mph.  You'd have to have a really big
hill to get it going that fast, and you wouldn't want to, because you'd
never be able to control it.

    I just hope you have a really good mechanic that knows Volkswagens
to bring it back to life.  If you've any questions, please feel free to
email me.  Don't kill that bus.

thanks,
