Subject: Re: [T2] RE: GEX

Well, as of Tuesday morning, their (gulp) customer service line was still 
being answered. So, i doubt it. Also, i just got a fancy GEX catalog in the 
mail. We can hold our breath, and use our gex warranties as sacrifical 
burnings if the reports are true..

&gt; &gt; A friend of mine told me on Sunday that GEX has gone out of business.  
&gt;If
&gt; &gt; he's right ---- HURRAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
&gt;
&gt;Their site's still up. That doesn't necessarily mean they're still in
&gt;business, though...there are still a few days until the next month's
&gt;installment on the webspace is due.
