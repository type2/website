No rust at the fuel filter?

&gt;  He had eyeballed the tank through the gas sender hole as
&gt; their is a &quot;factory&quot; cutout plate in the body above it, saw no rust)-
&gt; Since I know the injectors were clogged (put in new ones) it may be
&gt; sludge getting into the opening?

If the injectors were sludged there is probably sludge buildup in all the
metal lines from the tank (tank to filter, pump to fuel rail, both fuel
rails).

&gt; Anyone know if the 75 tank had a
&gt; raised line outlet or any kind of strainer?  The tank outlet nipples
&gt; seeem directly welded to the tank bottom; no raised lipo around them.
&gt; The gas line itself looks new.

This is an image I enhanced to show the tank pickup and return line that are
inside the bowl in the tank:

You can't get a good look at those from the sender, you need to view it from
the filler pipe hole.

&gt; I noticed the lines were
&gt; braided, marked in white 7mm ID, and were squishable when squeezed- I
&gt; thought FI hose was reinforced and not squeezable?  I called him, and he
&gt; claimed this braided stuff IS for FI, not carbs, and has been using it
&gt; for 20 years- would you concur?

VW used it at the factory but it's inadequate.

Bus-boys has a good description of the two types of fuel hose available:

http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/bb13374.htm#11

My pictures of the differences between the two:

http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/.Pictures/FuelHose/04-ClothHose2.JPG
http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/.Pictures/FuelHose/06-RegulatorHose.JPG

Both hoses are 25 years old.  The first was went from the 3/4 fuel rail to
the cold start valve.  The second was from the 1/2 rail to the pressure
regulator.  Both removed only once and not re-fitted.

Don't bother with the cloth braided variety.
