I set mine to .008 for many years.  I believe the reason was that the
exhaust valves run hotter and therefore expand more than the intakes.  I
never heard the &quot;loose valve clatter&quot; with them set at .008.

&gt;And honestly, I'm not trying to start a fight here...

I don't think this one will start a fight... will it?  :-/
