Subject: Re: Corner windows from Brasil

Is the any one that can help me.  

I just brought some corner windows that have VW Brasil
written on the ID tag.  Will these fit a German Bus? 
If you know some one that has a Brasilian bus could
you please ask them if they need to get special rubber
seals for them or if they just buy ones for a split
screen.

Thanks for your help

PS

What the world needs now is love, sweet love.  It is
the ONLY thing that there is just to little of!
