Subject: still tuning. still dreaming...

Greetings,
Did a little more fine tuning on the Bus today with good results. My 74 is
equipped with Weber 34ICT carbs and a Bosch 050 dist and I'm kinda nervous
about not being able to go to the book for the specs. I'm hoping someone
with this set-up will take the time to share their experience with me.
Thanks in advance.
