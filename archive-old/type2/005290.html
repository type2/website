Subject: Choke disabled or Hey where did my flat spot go?
Message-ID: &lt;00bc01be971f$91f9cc40$482d8ad1_at_18.41&gt;

Thanks to all that responded to my question regarding disabling the choke on
the Weber 32/36 DFEV. I loosened the 3 flat head screws, turned the whole
enchilada 120dgrs clockwise, checked for proper choke plate positioning and
presto-chango! The result was much reduced idle. I left my tach in the other
bus so I reset the idle by ear. After a few minutes of warm-up and I sped
off to lunch.

I noticed two important results. First, after a few miles of running there
was not the typical increase in rpm that I had been experiencing as of late.
Second, that dreaded flat spot (oh, I have a 009) that I had been plagued
with is greatly diminished.

A special thanks goes out to Sean Bartnik who helped me diagnose the problem
when I mentioned to him that my motor seemed to be running rich!!!!!! There
are no better folk than listfolk:)&gt;
