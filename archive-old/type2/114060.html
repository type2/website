Subject: Re: [T2] R: [T2] propane powered type2's - any further info on
  this?

&gt;GPL and methane cost almost half the same amount of diesel gas which is
&gt;already less expensive than gasoline - basically the car runs on both
&gt;gasoline or gas - you have a switch to go from the one system to the other;
&gt;only limitation is you have to finish one before passing to the other.

And what does gas cost in Italy. About $5 USD a gallon? Seems like that was 
about right when I was living there '91-'94.

A real shocker to put $50 of gas in a VW Rabbit... &lt;grin&gt;
