Subject: Fuel Injectors

Ok, you guys may recall that I have been trying to get
my bus running after I bought it from a guy who let it
sit for five years.  I have used Bentley to
troubleshoot, and I have found three locked up
injectors.  One works and I can see the spray pattern.
 The other, well, they do nothing!

Where can I get some injectors without dropping alot
of dough?  I rememeber in earlier discussions about
some that can be found at autozone; but when I ask the
dudes at autozone, they know nothing.

About cleaning the current injectors.  Is this
possible? any commercial places do it?  What about
rebuilt injectors?  Is this a reasonable alternative?

Thanks for the help in advance!!
