Subject: air tools

Hey Volks,
     I just got my new (to me anyway) air compressor going.  I finally have 
something with decent pressure and CFM.  It's a big SpeedAire from like the 
50's or so, dual stage, 80 gallon tank.
     How do I know how much pressure to run my air tools at?  Is there a 
rule of thumb for the general amount of pressure for each tool (DA, Air 
Ratchet, Impact Wrench, Cut Off Tool, etc.), or do you just run everything 
at full pressure?  This one seems to be maxing out at around 100 PSI, 
although, I think it could do better.  Is there any reason to dial it back 
for some things?
     Most of the tools I have say to oil daily.  What do I oil them with?  
Is there some special air too oil?  How much do I drop in?
     Anything else you can think of to extend the life of the 
tools/compressor that I should know?
