&gt;Anyway, do most of you put snow tires on your busses (if you drive through
&gt;snow that is).
&gt;Just anticipating the winter ahead,

Hi! Yep! We live at 8,600 feet and are driving in the snow already - 
and have been for almost 2 weeks, now!

I have two sets of wheels and tires for Her Majesty - chrome Porsch 
wheels with pretty aggressive mud and snows that are so big I couldn't 
chain them up if I wanted to, and her stock bus wheels (painted 
midnight pearl purple, of course) and they have the same tires (Cooper 
Weather Masters) with studs on all four! She cranks through snow and 
ice and the real plus, with the stubbies, is that she'll STOP!!! 

What a concept! 

But - when she's wearing her stubbies, I liken her to a beauty parlor 
blonde in a two thousand dollar beaded dress wearing ice climbing boots!

:-)

She looks way better in her dress up shoes!!!

Here's to a safe and not-so-slippery winter!
