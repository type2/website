Subject: Vacuum gauge

There has been some talk of using a vacuum guage to diagnose your engine
health.  I have an old vacuum gauge and tried it out before but with only
marginal success.  I attached it at the little nipple on the right side of
my air intake distributer.  I got a reading slightly below what the guage
says is a normal engine (Maybe I have a vacuum leak?).  Tom Wilson's book
states that you have to make sure you are not connecting to a &quot;ported&quot;
hose, but gives no indication of which are OK to use.  
So, to anyone out there who has experiance with these guages, where do
you use them and how exactly do you use them.  
The main points that I would like to know:
1)  Where to hook it up?
2)  Do you run the engine or just starter?
3)  How to interpret the results?
4)  Are all engines the same?  The guage say that certain vacuum is correct
for ALL engines, can this be true that they are all the same?

Thanks for your advice,
My vacuum gauge does me no good if I don't know how to use it,

Please excuse my spelling of gauge/guage, I realized I spelled to two
different ways, but my system does not allow a spell check or any
other corrections one you hit return.  It is sort of outdated!!
