Subject: Re: [T2] longing for warmer weather

&gt;Ontario, Maine, New York, are not Missiouri or North Carolina -  different 
&gt;climates entirely.
 
one of the main reasons I moved from New York  to North Carolina, I  was 
worried about the salt on my VW's 
I never thought it would lead me to opening a VW restoration business so I  
would guess this means there no chance a 12 step program will cure  me.:o)
