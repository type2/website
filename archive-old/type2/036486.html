Subject: Free parts

It is time for spring cleaning.  The following items are on my give-away
list, first come first served:

'72 front bumper brackets, not 100% straight

Wire shelf for ice box in '72 Westy

Air filter assembly for Weber K-297 carburetor (new, never used)

Front VW emblem, white

2 rear tail light assemblies (no lenses) in poor condition, but could be
cleaned up, possibly with new bulb sockets from FLAPS

2 rear side marker light assemblies (no lenses) in poor condition, but
could be cleaned up

Inside rear-view mirror for '72

Spare tire cover, covers half the tire, same yellow vinyl material as '72
Westy seats

2 Monroe shock absorbers for '72 REAR (Monroe #32592 or #32545) used 4K miles

Rear hatch latch (no key)

Engine compartment latch

All of this goes to the land fill soon if nobody is interested.  Anyone
interested, please email me off the list.  I will respond with the address
and number for the local Mail-Boxes-Etc in Marshall, Texas where you will
call to arrange for shipping.  Pay me nothing, I will just drop off the
part(s) and they ship them to you COD, credit card, or whatever you arrange
with them.

Sorry, but I am not willing to pre-pay the packing and shipping since I
have been burned before.  I am asking nothing for the parts.  If you are
not willing to make a phone call to Mail-Boxes-Etc then this deal is not
for you.
