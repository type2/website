&gt;yeah, and all parts tehy sell now are equal quality to the originals.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;  Breakdown cover (AA, RAC, AAA etc.) insures against failure.

&gt;i dunno about you, but i think carrying spares AND properly maintining
&gt;makes the best sense from a financial and convenience perspective.
&gt;
&gt;lets say my ECU on my 82 vnangon goes out in the middle of new mexico.
&gt;

In the many hundreds of vehicles I have serviced in the last 10 years,
I have replaced two Bosch ECU's and perhaps a dozen of other manufacture
like Triumph-Adler (can you say, Digifant???). Bosch technical has said 
that 80% of the ECU cores returned to them checked out nominal. The two I 
replaced were fried by other devices or the auto pilot mind being slower
than the spark when an item of procedure was missed. Ask me how I know. I
paid for that
one. Others have come to me from an ECU replacment at another shop to fix
the problem that the ECU had nothing to do with.

Thank you for the feedback.
