&gt; &gt; hey Guys  You would be surprized how far you can drive on three
&gt; &gt; clylinders,


but if the valve seat is truely dropped he might damage the piston and
connecting rod if he is hitting it at TDC.  would have to be very careful
that the valve seat is &quot;back in the hole&quot; before pulling the pushrod.
maybe it could be finesed but the risk of damage to the whole engine could
be significant if there are any pieces rattling around in there or if
things are stuck out to far.

might be able to check this out on the roadside but unless I could assure
myself that the valve was fully reseated into the &quot;Hole&quot; I'm not sure I
would drive it.

now if when looking at the valves you can be sure that both valve stems
are all the way up, it might be worth trying

I've been both ways and in one case drove quite a distance,. in the other
it was trailered just 12 miles to prevent major damage.
