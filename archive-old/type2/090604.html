&gt; Ok so I just bought a 73 passenger bus from an auto mechanic.  He says it
&gt; needs more exhaust pieces.  The PO didnt want to fix the bus so he left it
&gt; there and dropped off the title, I picked it up for $200.  The only known
&gt; problem is the lack of exhaust(nothing is currently attached to the bus, all
&gt; in the trunk compartment).  It has the heat echangers, muffler, and tail
&gt; pipe...does it need anything else or is does this mechanic just not know
&gt; anything about busses.

Brennan,

The correct answer may be (b) this mechanic just does not know anything
about buses... IF all the bits that are there are in good shape.  What
you describe:
2 heater boxes (left and right)
1 muffler
1 tailpipe
is the complete kit on '73 T4 buses.  Now the possible pitfalls:
 o check flange-pipe joints for rust;
 o check the ends that go to the head.  they should be tight to the heater
   box, flat and square (no sign of exhaust gas leaking);
 o the muffler is *probably* trash (internal rust), but they are available
   new;
 o you will need gaskets:
    4 copper ring gaskets, heater box to head
    2 trapezoidal metal gaskets, heater box to muffler
    1 ring gasket, muffler to tailpipe.
