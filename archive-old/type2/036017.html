Subject: The *good* news from todays bus-toils...

Well, along with my futile attempts at fixing the
brake light/turn signal issue on the '69 Westy (see my
previous posts), I managed to fix my sticking accell
pedal!

I'd had the sticking-pedal problem before. At the
time, I 'fixed' it by replacing the missing
spring-clip on the con-rod that goes from the pedal to
the linkage under the floor pan and lubed it well.
This was a dramatic improvement and lasted for a
*whole* year before sticking again.

This time, I again found the spring-clip missing
(these are the same springs as on the heater control
linkage under the dash). Not having a spare, I once
again pirated one from the heater linkage and
duplicated my previous efforts. This worked for about
2 minutes, then the spring flew off!!!

Sooo. I reattached the spring and watched the linkage
from below while I moved it back and forth. It was
definitely binding somewhere. I then pulled the little
con-rod (between the pedal and lower linkage) off and
inspected it. The wear indicated the pedal was riding
off-center. 

I then added a washer between the pedal and the bend
in the con-rod inside the cab and 3 washers between
the lower linkage and the end of the con-rod (where
the spring-clip goes). Instead of using a spring-clip,
I took 2 pieces of wire and twisted them tightly
around the indentation (where the clip is &quot;supposed&quot;
to hold, but doesn't). Lube...done.

A test drive showed an incredible difference in
acceleration, better idle at stop lights and best
yet...I was able to easily pull a steep hill in 3rd,
when I used to labor in second! My bus has *never* run
like this before!

I will make a diagram of what I did and post it to my
web-site.
