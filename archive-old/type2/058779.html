I finally fixed the date on the subj line.  I am batting zero these 
days....

Quoth David Easterwood, referring to Hillsborough River State Park:

&gt; This is where I was planning, but Joe sent me an email this morning
&gt; about a campground closer to Dade City.  He is checking on that and
&gt; I am sure he will post to the list his findings.

Will do - may be a day or so.  Even at Hills. River SP, 
you're not more than 15-20 minutes from the show.  Whatever spot, I'm 
hoping we can get a bunch of folks to go.  Camping at VW shows is a 
blast.  Buncha freex just wanderin' around behind the little 
animals....

&gt; I will be hosting some people from NC and TN at my place in
&gt; Marietta, GA Thursday night (November 5) and we will be caravanning
&gt; to Tampa early Friday morning.  Maybe we can talk some of the &quot;Bus
&gt; Butts&quot; from St. Louis into coming down with us?
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone wanting to ride down with us is welcome to come to my house
&gt; Thursday night or Friday morning.

I'd like to make a similar offer to those coming in from west/midwest 
locations (will have to confirm with the Mrs.) -- Tallahassee's about 
4-5 hours (at bus speed) from the show locale, and I'm planning to 
head down Friday with whoever will caravan.  If you'd like to 
stopover Thursday nite on your way down, let me know -- I'm five 
minutes from I-10.
