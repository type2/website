&gt;Hi Folks,
&gt;
&gt;I'll start out by saying I'm frustrated.  I've been dealing with exhaust 
&gt;leaks for the last 25,000 miles (since my new rebuild was new), and have 
&gt;suffered yet another setback.  The mechanic who has had my Bus for the 
&gt;last week called yesterday and told me he's going out of business and has 
&gt;no time to fix my Bus before he closes his shop.  So, it looks like I will 
&gt;have to solve my problem myself.

Too cheap to stay in business???? I would start reading the warranty papers 
on that rebuild.

&gt;The last time I pulled my exhaust apart (last summer), I filed the heat 
&gt;exchanger flanges down so the headers would hit the head before the 
&gt;flanges did.

Reduced mass= less heat carrying capacity. Thinner= lower strength, more 
flex. How did the heads get out of spec?? Improper machining should be 
under warranty.

&gt;  I think the engine builder should have taken this precaution, but that's 
&gt; more the fault of the lousy replacement parts manufacturers than anything.

Those were the lowest cost parts you could find, right?? They are indeed 
lousy and wasteful if results is the target.

&gt;   Since I overtorqued the studs trying to get a bad part to fit, the 
&gt; studs have pulled out of the head.

But it was a cheaper way to go than fixing it right, right???? Always prior 
to removing the exhaust nuts, back them off a bit then torque them spec, so 
if they are too weak to hold spec, you don't find that out until 
re-assembly. You know upon teardown the repair or replacement will be needed.

Over torque is a lesson all novices must learn before becoming an 
apprentice. Join the club. Everybody starts by learning from such mistakes. 
The only reason we learn is if we pay the cost of the mistake.

&gt;I checked the archives, and the consensus (from 5-6 posts) seems to be 
&gt;that the drill/tap method is best for longevity.  In addition, there is 
&gt;concern of drilling straight so as to keep the heat exchangers flat &amp; straight.

I have many years experience with aluminum thread problems. Without pulling 
the heads and setting them up properly I couldn't make good usable repairs 
more than 50% of the time. With 3 studs to do, I would not risk it. All the 
time is wasted because they now must be pulled anyway. Trying to get around 
doing the work right risks lots of waste that could be used to found the 
actual cost of solving the issues with purely the correct application of 
specs, no matter how much time/skill/money is involved to get a result that 
needs no more fussing for the long haul.

&gt;Questions:
&gt;
&gt;2. I've never tapped threads into metal, let alone into the part of my car 
&gt;that makes it go.  Which tools and methods are recommended?  What should I 
&gt;avoid so I don't destroy my engine?

Replace the heads with a spec set, or have these repaired by a good VW A/C 
skilled machinist.


&gt;3. If a weld on a heat exchanger flange is broken, can I get it welded, or 
&gt;do I need a new heat exchanger?

New or good used is the easiest and least expensive. Very rare to see 
exhaust re-welds last more than a year or two. If not jigged perfectly, the 
strain will crack them in short order.


&gt;I'm not looking forward to lying on my back and working over my head for 
&gt;hours, but I have little choice.

The choice never varies. Either you do spec work and get insured results or 
you compromise and hope for the best. As you are learning, every compromise 
involves risk and the best results will remain allusive.
