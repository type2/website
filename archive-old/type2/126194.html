Subject: 2.0l with Weber 34 ICT's distributor

I recently helped a friend rebuild the 2.0l engine in
his 78 bus.  He has Weber 34 ICT's and a 009 distributor.

I know the 009 is not a good distributor for the type IV
engine &amp; I have a VW 022-905-205S/Bosch 0231 170 093
vacuum advance distributor which I think came off a fuel
injected 2.0l.

The Webers have a vacuum port on each carb which are
currently plugged with vinyl caps.

My questions are:
#1 - Would this vacuum advance distributor be appropriate?
&amp; if so:
#2 - Should I run the vacuum line from 1 carb or t both?

Dave
