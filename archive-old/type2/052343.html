Subject: Re: [T2] and the spark plug went POP

Check with one of the local motorcycle shops - that's what I had to do the 
last time I had a similar problem (exhaust studs).

They may even do it for you - and right....

Good luck.

&gt;So I'm on Whidbey Island up here in Seattle last Sunday. The engine is
&gt;running terribly rough and so I pull over to find out that the last mechanic
&gt;I brought the van to set the timing at 5 degrees before TDC instead of 5
&gt;after (and my timing scale even has the red dot marking 5 after)... After
&gt;resolving to never ever bring business to that mechanic again we fix it up,
&gt;and head off to the musical sound of a well running vw engine... while
&gt;driving up a hill all of a sudden comes a loud POP from the back and I
&gt;immediately lose power... now I had the radio on so I couldn't hear the
&gt;engine that well and all I could think was thrown rod or dropped valve... I
&gt;kill the engine and coast over to the side... walk around to the back and
&gt;check the heat... engine doesn't feel like it's too hot, but the dipstick
&gt;does feel a bit warm... I try turning over the engine (after disconnecting
&gt;the coil) and it turns over fine with no nasty clanky noises. So I go back
&gt;to check the engine and notice that one of my spark plug wires is hanging
&gt;loose. sure enough there's a plug attached to the end with stripped threads.
&gt;Only the bottom two rings of thread are dark nd stripped though (the bottom
&gt;two by the electrode), the rest of the threads look a bit white and ashy, as
&gt;if THEY WERE NEVER THREADED IN!!!... so this bone-head mechanic that set the
&gt;timing wrong also cross-threaded my plug and didn't get it all the way in...
&gt;Anyway moral of the story is after filing the mush out of the plug and
&gt;trying to reinstall it (with fingers crossed that I could get it into the
&gt;head) I ended up calling AAA for a tow... back to seattle... over the
&gt;ferry... at 9:30 at night...
&gt;
&gt;So the moral of my story? I'll never let a mechanic touch my van again
&gt;unless a spend a lot of time getting to know them and their work...
&gt;
&gt;And a question: Now I've called Time-sert looking for a way to fix the hole
&gt;(and time-serts seem to be the best way to go, according to word on the
&gt;list), and found out that the insert will cost about 3 bucks but the tools
&gt;will cost 94, I wanted to see if anyone in the Seattle area might have the
&gt;toolset and be willing to part with it for a day for 10 bucks, or a beer, or
&gt;come tap the head with me, or at the least give me advice on the best way to
&gt;do the operation...
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!
