I'm outside of Fredericksburg VA and since January I have seen 0 buses on the
road. I have seen 2 vanagons one with out of state plates. It's pretty void
here also.

bus for about 2 months now, I've come to the conclusion&gt; &gt; that there's only
about 1 other bus in this area (Pasco County, Florida)&gt; &gt; that anybody
actually *drives*  I've seen a handful parked in driveways,&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; But I've
only seen 1 other bus on the road.  It's a powder-blue bus with&gt; &gt; a white
top, and seems to be in really good shape.  There's  1 or 2&gt; &gt; &gt; Am I just in
a void of busses?&gt; &gt; no don't think so, I live in Baltimore and there are
maybe 4-5 buses left&gt; on the road here and while their not all on the list, I
know everyone by&gt; sight if not by name......  a new or different one gets a
double take to&gt; see if I recognize someone... and most folks just aren't
driving them&gt; anymore on a daily basis,. was a couple years ago that I stopped
seeing&gt; the last regularly driven splitty I guess the bays are getting to be
&quot;no&gt; longer transport but now toys&quot;    still a few of us iconoclasts around&gt;
that use em for daily drivers, but even I have stopped taking mine on long&gt;
drives much anymore, not because I don't want to but when the bus gets&gt; 18mpg
and my wifes little S*turn gets 34mpg well it becomes economics.&gt; &gt; see you on
