Subject: Public Service Announcement: Steering Linkage Rubber

I've decided to make a Public Service Announcement.

Yesterday I discovered a huge problem with the steering on my bus which came
out of nowhere and was as potentially lethal as a bad fuel line. The bushing
between the steering wheel and the steering reduction box had completely
disintegrated and the steering wheel was rendered useless. Luckily this
happened in my driveway... if it happened on the highway I am sure there
would have been injuries.

For a better view of the disintegrated bits, have a look at:

My 79 transporter is in pretty good shape for its age (We're talking about
an east coast daily driver here), but I will admit that when I got the van
this spring most of the rest of the rubber on it was in bad shape. Tires and
window seals were in very poor condition, although the door seals were all
pretty good (read: replaced within the past 5 years) While the tires and
window seals are immediately obvious, the steering bushing is NOT.

&lt;SOAP BOX MODE&gt;

If you haven't looked at the bushing on your bus lately, you should,
especially if there is any other decayed rubber on your bus.  Just undo the
two screws on the housing at the base of the steering wheel and take a peek.
OK, it's slightly more involved than inspecting a fuel line but it is every
bit as critical to protect yourself and the ones you love.

&lt;/END SOAP BOX MODE&gt;

I talked to my friendly local VW parts dude (that's Karl at E+W motors) and
have sourced out the part I need from VW for $57.00 Cdn. Apparently VW
Canada does still list the bushing, but since there are none in stock on
Canadian soil I will have to wait a few days to get it brought up from the
states.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
