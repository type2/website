Your a cracker, Chris.

This happens sooner or later to anyone who ignores the obvious long enough.
(Ape with stick up = me too) Pull the lid seal out at the top.  Whatever
you do, do not strip the hinge screw heads. Clean the slots well, dig the
paint and crud out of them, then use a good screwdriver. If you do strip
them, that's another post. Might need an impact bit to break them free if
they have been there unmoved since Elvis. Once they move a bit, squirt them
with penetrating oil. Move it a bit more, more lube, till they twist out.
Then pull the lid with the hinges straight out. Now remove the hinge screws
from the lid and remove the hinges.  Use a calipers to determine the size
of the pin. Use a drill bit just a bit smaller than the pin.  Mount them in
a vice. Center punch the pin. Now drill out the pins. Replace the pins with
the biggest cotter pin that will fit. Probably the same size as the rear
hub nut pins.
