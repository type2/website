Subject: Re: [T2] Al Bugs Me Show 

I've got one of the pre-registrations here in front of me, but it is pretty
minimal on info.  It does say the show is from Friday June 21 to Sunday June
23, but says nothing about camping, or camping fees.  Registration is $15
per car (maybe they don't want busses).  This is sponsored by Anheuser-Busch
and will be at their plant.  It is called the Bud Bug Classic 2002.

There is a contact email, maybe you'd better have a talk with him:

albugsme_at_frii_dot_com or 970.493.1300

&gt; I hear there is a vw show in Ft Collins Colorado on the 22nd of this month.
&gt; To be held at the Budweiser brewery.  Does anyone have any info?  How is
&gt; camping with extreme fire warnings in Colorado?  any response is appreciated?
