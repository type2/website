Here's the info on that meet in Southern Oregon at the end of the month. 
It sounds good.

Hi! This is a general map of the area.I'll send a closer map in a 
moment.This
is a casual swap meet and show open to all VW's,all conditions, and 
Porsches.
This is the second event that they have organized. The first one was 
very
successful since the only advertising they did was a flyer at the local 
espresso
bar and word of mouth. Last time they had from 80 to 100 VW'S attend. If 
you want
anymore information about it, you can call (541)479-0786. The entry fee 
is $1.00,
Swap meet spaces are $10.00, and Food Vendor spaces are $15.00.

This is a closer map of the area. The actual meet will be 1 block north 
of the
&quot;X&quot;. I hope you can retrieve these maps OK because this is the first 
time that
I've tried sending them. Please E-mail us back to let us know if you got 
this
allright. Hope to see you there!
