Subject: Re: [T2] Best cheap paint job for 77 Westy . Maaco  etc

Hi Dave,

I took my 73 westy to a local Maaco 5.5 years ago. I was expecting  
that for $400 I would get two years out of it. Today I am still quite  
pleased with the finish they applied, though some rust that was  
unknown to me then has recently started to bubble up. This is not  
unusual in Ontario, and probably would have happened regardless of  
who painted it.

Be aware that Maaco and Earl Schreib are both in business to make  
money painting cars. They attract customers with low prices, and the  
more cars they can paint, the more $$ they take home.  They are  
usually pretty good at painting, but not very attentive to prep work.  
They offer varying grades of paint... I chose the mid-grade for a  
price of $379. (Low-ball was $299, deluxe was $499).

The secret to a good paint-job is in the prepping. But Maaco et al do  
as little prep as possible before they paint, because time prepping  
is time not spent painting. And painting is where their $$$ comes  
from. If *YOU* prep the vehicle before you take it in you will get a  
much better result:

Tips:
- Remove the trim, door-seals and door-handles. They will merely tape  
them off, and the end results will look like it.
- Remove the windows and seals.
- Remove the bumpers, headlights, tail-lights and lenses. Remove the  
bulbs, and tape off the reflectors. if it's removalble, take it off.
- If you're applying primer, ask ahead of time what primers are  
compatible with their paint system.
- If the vehicle has to be towed to the paint-shop, so be it.

Here's my bus prepped and waiting in the Maaco lot:

This will add about 4-8 hours labour to the job, but the end result  
will be well worth it.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
