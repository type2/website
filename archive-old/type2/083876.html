Subject: RE: Re: [T2] bleeding brakes by oneself

I seem to remember a website where someone made one of these out of a garden
sprayer and an extra master cylinder cap fitted with a barbed fitting. One
could probably make one for less than $20. I know that Home Depot sells a
gallon sprayer for $10.

&gt;AIR COOLED VW POWER BLEEDER. Works on most Air Cooled VWs, including Bugs, 
&gt;Buses, and Square Backs and Fast Backs (Adapter 1104).  Price: $44.95

I've just used this device to replace the brake fluid in my three running 
AC VWs.
It's BY FAR the best of the several techniques I've tried.  Worth every
penny.
