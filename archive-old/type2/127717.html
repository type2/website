Subject: RE: [T2] Billet Type 4 lifters

For those who are interested

http://www.shoptalkforums_dot_com/viewtopic.php?p=506458#506458

Some engine shops have lost 20 engines in the last 6 months because of
lifters. I decided to do something about it.

These are NOT overkill for a bus, unless you think that a tear down at less
than 100 miles is acceptable due to a bad lifter.
