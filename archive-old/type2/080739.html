Subject: Transvair for Sale

Looks like I am going to be selling my Transvair kit.  If anybody is
interested let me know.  Engine is overall good, excellent OP, could use
minor head work, some valve difficulty, not sure what kind yet, but not
severe runs great (not apart yet) transmission is good, differential good
but needs a seal or bushing I think, clutch is bad due to oil impregnation I
think.  ( do not have it all apart yet so I am not clear yet on the
specifics.)  Runs good oil pressure. Engine rebuilt 99 by a Corvair place in
FL. Two rebuilt carbs from Clarks just installed.  One guy Emailed with
interest but I lost his Email.  I have already got a newly overhauled engine
so the decision was made for me to go back to VW but I would be interested
in trading for somebody's runout VW guts since I don't yet have a tranny or
the miscellaneous parts.  A good chance to do the conversion since it is all
here that you'd need.  Glen Ward Bridgeport WV
