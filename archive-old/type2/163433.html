Subject: Re: [T2] '78 Westy Low Beam Headlight

In most cases, this is usually caused by bad grounding.  But, there are
other areas to check.

All beams are individually fused, left and right, so I would start checking
there.  If yer running with aluminum fuses (these are real CHEEPIES), get
rid of 'em.  Always use fuses with brass, not aluminum.  Be sure the &quot;tangs&quot;
the fuses go into are CLEAN and free of corrosion.  Yeah, it could
be corrosion at the left and/or right low beam fuse, especially in areas of
the country with high humidity.  Another area of attention should be made at
the headlight connector itself.  Clean the female connections and the male
ones on the beam itself - use die-electric grease to protect the connections
and prevent corrosion.  Trace the Brown (Ground) wire at the beam
connector to where it grounds to the chassis and clean that up too.

Joseph Ames mentions the headlight relay itself, but if that was the case,
it would manifest it on the left and right low beams at the same time.  But,
to be safe, unplug the relay and again - CLEAN the connections.

&gt; One of my low beam headlights does not shine.  The high beams are OK, but
&gt; sometimes the left, and sometimes the right low beam will not shine.
&gt; Always ONE of the two will be dark.  It has switched from the left to the
&gt; right, back to the left and then back to the right low beam headlight
&gt; being
&gt; dark.  No particular reason, just switched to dark on its own.  But
&gt; ALWAYS,
&gt; for more than the past year, ONE of the low beams has been dark.
&gt; When I measure the voltage on the low beam socket when I take the bulb
&gt; out,
&gt; I get a very low (digital measurement) voltage reading.
&gt; What causes just ONE of the low beam lights to get this low voltage, and
&gt; not
&gt; the other; and why does it switch back and forth, always ONE being dark.
&gt; So, right now, I drive with my HIGH BEAMS only, but I am due for a safety
&gt; inspection soon, so I need to get this solved.
&gt; Thanks.
