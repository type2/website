Subject: 6 out of 8 ain't bad?

Hi Volks,

Those who have seen my bus this year have probably heard it long  
before laying eyes on it. The plumber's nightmare cast-iron custom  
exhaust had more than a couple of leaks. Today I decided enough was  
enough and dropped that bad boy in favor of a 74-74 set up. I had  
been saving the 72-74 rig for Colleen's Sunroof Automatic bus but the  
noise from the camper was getting on my nerves, so I'll just have to  
figure something else out for the sunroof.

Surprisingly enough, I only broke one exhaust stud (#1 on the block  
side) taking the old exhaust down. And it was a PITA to remove,  
requiring a lot of heat, paraffin, heat, ice, and 2 hours of vice  
grip action to break it free. I replaced it with a worthy candidate  
from a spare &quot;core&quot; 2L head and set into bolting up the new heat.  
Life was good.

But the good feeling didn't last long... I broke the other &amp;^%$_at__at_!!##  
stud on the #1 cylinder tightening things up. This one is on the head  
side and doesn't have much access to get at it. I am going to have to  
have another run at it tomorrow... I've used up all my energy for  
exhaust work in one day, and I think I need to acquire a fresh set of  
vice grips for this one. Or else borrow a welder.

Note to self: Stockpile some fresh exhaust studs and replace the  
entire set on the sunroof motor before bolting it together. I think  
I'll arrange a group buy with the local Ontario bus owners and get in  
touch with the supplier that Richard Atwell discovered.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
