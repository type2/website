&gt; OK.  Why do you disconnect the battery by removing the ground cable??
&gt; 
&gt; What's so bad about removing the power cable??

Off hand Its ssems more convenient because the neg terminal is closer to
you(should be anyway) also if you accidently short the wrench to the
chassis it wont weld to it. If theres a very technical reason I cant think
of it.
