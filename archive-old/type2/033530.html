never believe anything a manufacturer tells you about how superier their
product is...

why change to a system that once you learn you are unable to use any
other keyboard in the world?  personally im capable of almost 100 wpm on
a qwerty keyboard, and used to hit 60 on a manual typewriter, its not
the keyboard that is the limiting factor its a talent like any other
and takes practice.  this keyboard was not designed
to slow you down it was designed to balance keystrokes between hands...

read the above linked article, (lot of blah blah garbage but its in
there)
