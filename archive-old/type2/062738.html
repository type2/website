Subject: wanna parts bus

Hi all,

I have recently been thinking about buying myself a spare parts bus for my 
1800cc, 1975 carburetted kombi. I am getting a bit sick of spending big bucks 
on silly little items that for some funny reason were either missing or broken 
on my kombi, and my fiancee is not living with me at the moment so I could 
sneak it into the backyard when she is not around :-}

Some of the bits I would be interested in include: Brake disks and drums, 
sliding door, some  interior panels, some spare CV joints, a glovebox, and 
other bits and pieces. I guess I don't really NEED any of these parts 
individually, but they would be nice to have. As for the disks and drums - 
mine work fine, but I know they are too thin and would not stand up to 
rigorous state inspection (possible problem for next year).

I am also (possibly pipe dreaming) entertaining the idea of rebuilding the 
motor out of the spare so that when my engine goes I can simply bolt in the 
new one. I am a realist in some regards, and I know that I would spend months 
trying to rebuild an engine - which is not feasible for a car that I need 
everyday. 

Anyway I am wondering if 2 litre engines would bolt straight into my 1800 van, 
or if I would need to make any modifications. 

I guess if I can widen my search for a spare beyond another 1975 1800 cc 
version I will have more chance of success. I think if the (1700, 1800, and 
2000cc) engines are interchangeable then I would be able to use most other 
parts from kombis between 73 and 77. 

Sorry I have rambled a bit! 
Anyway, I would appreciate any comments about this idea.

Thanks
Ben (75 Kombi)
