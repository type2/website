Subject: Re: New electrical problem?


Errr...did you see this bizarre internal battery problem with your own
eyes, maybe cut the top off the thing? Or did you put a meter on the
battery which the shop undoubtedly saved for you? Oh, they didn't?

Like others I am very suspicious of this. You had symptoms of a
high-resistance starter problem (drive hard, let the bus sit a few minutes
and heat-sink, then try to start it back); chances are you had a corroded
ground connection like the rest of us get twice a year it seems.

The problem is that fixing a ground problem is nearly free, it requires
only a wrench and a wire brush, no consumables. The &quot;remedy&quot; is a new
battery, doubtless with a hefty markup.

You should hang out here and learn to diagnose these things. I wouldn't go
near that shop again, to reward them for teaching me an expensive lesson.

&gt;It turns out that I had something go wrong INTERNALLY in my battery that
&gt;caused it to
&gt;break the circuit.  My VW guy replaced the pos and neg cables and the
&gt;battery, and it
&gt;fired right up.  It was strange, because the Bus has been running and
&gt;starting fine,
&gt;without any indication of a weak or moribund battery.
