&gt; Through the years VWoA has been a source for genuine German parts, to the

&gt; 20 years+ in favor of aftermarket stuff designed to be cheap. If owners who
&gt; bought an early VW because they thought they were made of cheap parts, they
&gt; should reflect on their rationality. The early VW's have such a good
&gt; overall reputation for being ecomomical only when they are comprized of
&gt; real VW specification parts. But they last three times as long as the
&gt; wannabees at twice the cost, typically. Where is true value?

I think that it's a myth that German VW parts are inherently any better
than parts from other parts of the world.  The VW was designed to be built
inexpensively and to function for 100K km or so.  Remember that VW used to
consider it an event when a car exceeded 100K km, to the point where they
would issue a special badge on the occasion.  My VWs with over 1/4 of a
million miles each are an anomoly, and were certainly not intended to last
that long.  There are just many parts that, if you use the standard sizes,
will go way beyond the standard 100K km.

Yes, some non-German parts were crap, but they were made sloppily.  Both
of my VWs are being pushed around by completely American-made engines and
they seem to work just fine.

&gt; Wait till you have to rely upon a Henco en Mexico clutch cross shaft. Then
&gt; judge VWoA for &quot;overpricing&quot; the cost for a real precision piece of high
&gt; metalurgy that not only fuctions properly, but, as intended, does so
&gt; through at least three long life clutches, if they as well are genuine.

I've had two of those &quot;precision&quot; German clutch shafts break.  The
&quot;no-name&quot; replacements were obviously much better engineered than the
original German part, where spot-welding was deemed to be good enough for
the projected life of the car.

&gt; VWoA cannot keep costs within reason if only 10% of the smaller early
&gt; market seek the value of the real deal. They can't run off a few thousand
&gt; proper cross shafts that take 5 years or more to sell to the few.

Funny, the aftermarket seems not to have a problem with this.  I'm sure
that they wouldn't mind selling a few to VW that VW could sell with a 100%
markup.

&gt; Now if at
&gt; least 50% of the early VW croud through the years were buying from the OEM
&gt; source, they would surly still be there for us now that the genuine parts
&gt; are FINALLY worn beyond specification.
&gt; 
&gt; No one here can set up a new production of a true specification cross shaft
&gt; at the last and now no longer avaliable VWoA price. Certainly not for 10%
&gt; or less of the market that demands reality as opposed to the 90% who demand
&gt; the cheapest facade that looks like the real deal.

But wait a minute.  On this very part, there are available superior
aftermarket versions at reasonable prices.  VW does not sell them, but
that is VW's choice.  They have abandoned the market.

OTOH, if VW wants to shut the maker of these
superior parts down simply because their part fits a VW I will be quite
angry.  The manufacturer certainly doesn't have the right to stamp
&quot;Volkswagen&quot; on the part, but they do have the right to fill the demand
that the OEM is ignoring.

I agree that cheap tends to drive out quality, but in this case VW has no
interest in selling aircooled parts (or any parts beyond their warranty
obligations, for that matter). They'd rather sell a new car.
There's a lot more profit in it.  That's business.
