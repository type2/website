&gt; &gt; Now I should probably weld a repair, but I'm not set up to do so.
&gt; &gt; Anyway, this looks like a suitable candidate for a fiberglass repair.

&gt; Not an answer to the exact question, but my '79 bus had AC and the hacked
&gt; part. I fixed it by cutting a piece out of a junkyard bus and carefully
&gt; patching it in. I braised it with my little portable torch. I remember being
&gt; at the junkyard and the guys there could not believe I was borrowing the
&gt; cutting torch and cutting a piece out of the engine bay of a junker, and
&gt; that was going to PAY for it. But it made the repair much easier to have the
&gt; right shaped steel piece.

that sure was easier than the way I did it, I actually fabricated a
duplicate part, had to cut, bend and weld three different pieces of metal
to get the shape, took most of a day. what with cutting, fitting, welding,
grinding to get it to come out.  when I was done looked nice but hacking
from a junkyard bus would have been a lot easier
