Subject: Re: mirror gasket monkey business

Whilst driving one day, I did perchance to notice my driver side mirror start 
to slip out of what was left of the gray gasket once holding it into the 
frame. Missed it by that much. Got the pieces picked up tho, so the next guy 
didn't have to pick them out of his tires. Had a glass company cut me a new 
one, and affixed it with a couple of fat globs of silicone caulk into the 
frame. then used same caulk to create new gasket. Many years later, it's 
still there. but the silicone [or something]  is causing the silver to darken 
in spots. Next time, I'll try something different. Won't know what till I 
need to.  But it worked. that's the thing to remember. It aint stock, it aint 
real pretty, it aint fancy, but it works. And, as my bus is a daily driver, I 
don't have the luxury of waiting weeks on end for parts to come in from 
timbuktu. And god forbid that the vw dealers should have parts for my 76 bus. 
In 12 years of ownership, the only part I've ever found at a dealership when 
I needed it was an electrical box that was part of the FI.
And here's something you might want to try while waiting to gather enough 
money to replace your window rubber- &quot;Liquid electrical tape&quot;. Comes in a 
small can, with a brush in the lid. Black, sticky, dries glossy, From more 
than a few inches away, ya hardly notice it. I painted most of my window 
rubber with it, and it  seals cracks, and stops leaks. When she goes back to 
the shop for another paint job, she'll get new rubber. I promise.
