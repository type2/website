&gt; Hello,
&gt; I would look at the wire attached to the idle cut off valve. On the side of
&gt; the carb. When you turn off the ignition, power is cut at the valve, which
&gt; closes it, This cuts off any excess gas from getting sucked into carb.

&gt; P.S. my wire was loose and caused the run on.

Weird. One day my car wouldn't start at all. Turned out that the idle cutoff
valve wasn't opening. To make the car run again (especially since the VW
parts store was closed at the time), I used a pair of aviation snips to cut
the end of the plunger off. I'm getting no run-on.
