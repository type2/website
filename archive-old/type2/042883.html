&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I just installed a new tiger 581 on my 78 FI westfalia. It works fine 
&gt; but makes a high pitched squeal when the ignition is turned on. To 
&gt; anyone who has one of these installed, is this normal? This module was 
&gt; modified by Universal to accomodate the tach pulse requirements of the 
&gt; Bosch ECU so I have considered that this may be a factor but still have 
&gt; no experience with these units so I am clueless and slightly worried by 
&gt; this noise.
&gt;
