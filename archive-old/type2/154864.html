Subject: RE: [T2] Annual smog checks coming to CA? 

Here in Denver-Metro, we are required to get an idle sniffer test every year
for any vehicle made before 1982. ANY vehicle, even a model T last time I
checked. For classic vehicles over 30 years old you can buy a classic auto
plate for $70 bucks and your test is every 7 years.

The only vehicles that haven't passed emissions in my stable were my 86
Toyota pickup (carb, now deceased) and my 89 Jeep Wrangler (carb, since MPI
injected). None of my VWs have failed and it always makes me feel better
that I adjusted their carbs/FI correctly. It is 10 bucks every year and
takes about 5 minutes. Also if you fail, you get a free retest so you can
get your car fixed.

I think the program's core intention, without the bureaucratic rhetoric and
posturing, is to keep oil blowing, over-rich older cars from belching their
filth all over the place. Any car will run well below limits if tuned
correctly, the emissions test actually helps keep your vehicle in tune
because if it fails, most likely it isn't running correctly in the first
place.

I don't mind handing over my $15 bucks if it helps keep a poorly maintained
&quot;classic&quot; vehicle from poisoning my neighborhood. However, when your vehicle
doesn't pass, it can be frustrating.
