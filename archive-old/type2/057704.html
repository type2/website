Subject: Sump Plate Question

Hey All!
I recently acquired a sump plate from a Porsche 914, and I plan to install
an oil temperature sender into it's existing threaded hole.  However, there
is a
small amount of rust (actually looks more like fresh oxidation rather than
full-on rust) in a handful of spots on the side of the plate that faces up
into the oil sump.  Being one that views my oil as something &quot;pure&quot; that
shouldn't be contaminated with anything other than more oil, I was
wondering if these rusty spots coming in contact with my oil from below can
harm anything.  What do you think -- good to go as is, just steel-wool or
sand the rusty material off, or is further action necessary?  (I would
assume that going as far as treating and painting over the rust -- and then
exposing this concoction to the oil -- would not be the prudent solution.) 

Also, in general, does anyone know where I pick up a new O-ring for that
914 sump plate -- is this something I have to go to Porsche for, or is it
standard enough that I would be able to get it at VW or a FLAPS (and will
they know what I'm talking about)?

Anyway, grateful in advance for your help.
