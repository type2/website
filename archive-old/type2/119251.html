Subject: RE: [T2] westy door panels

&gt; Does anyone know of a source for new replacement front door 
&gt; panels in that pretty green color that was used in late '70's
westy's...
&gt; (sage green exterior) 


Unfortunately TMI pretty much has the market cornered on heat-seamed
finished front door panels, and while we sell their panels, they do not
offer a green that matches the Westy green. 

We do sell unfinished door panels quite inexpensively if you can find
green vinyl to match (or paint them)...

Otherwise your only bet is to try to locate a used set. Any chrome
yellow or sage green '76-79 will have the same color panels.
