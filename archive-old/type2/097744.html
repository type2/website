Subject: RE: [T2] Starting Problem

To answer:

Did the starter &quot;Try&quot; to crank the engine or did the soenoid(sp) not push
the gear far enough out.

Answer:

Basically we heard the gear shoot out and hit, but since it wasn't spinning,
it didn't have momentum to turn the flywheel.  One more thing: somethings we
would short the start to make it spin, however when it stopped spinning, we
could turn the key and make it all work correctly.  Weird
