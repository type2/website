slip it on and use small &quot;zip&quot; ties ( the nylon thingies) it holds it in place
really neatly, and doesn't rip the boot like clamps can......

&gt; Quick Question:  I'm assuming that the little black &quot;dipstick boot&quot; fits
&gt; between the case and the fan housing on my 1978 2.0 rebuilt engine, right?
&gt; Do you need to seal it or put clamps on it to keep oil from blowing out, or
&gt; do you just slip it on?
&gt;
&gt; My previous engine was a 914 engine an had a completely diferent dipstick
&gt; set-up.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks a lot,
