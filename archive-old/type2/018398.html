I think the web site that you're remembering was Riechert:

     http://www.ismi_dot_net/riecherttuning/exhaustT4.htm

Some questionable things about this Type IV exhaust system though.  It
says &quot;fits in most Beetles without modifications&quot;, and &quot;requires a
modified exhaust manifold (heat exchangers) as shown&quot;.  Yet there's no
mention of exhaust port shapes (round vs. rectangular).

But these questions aside, I've been wondering just how easy or
difficult it is to buy stuff mail-order from outside the U.S.  Although
I've posted inquiries on both the List and newsgroups, nobody can tell
me of their direct experience doing so, if any.
