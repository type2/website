I have an OE remote starter button in the engine bay of my '65 Triumph 2000. 
Very useful when taking compression readings...

...well, i gave that advice, because the relay trick doesn't always work, 
and the single wire, believe it or not is MUCH easier than dealing with all 
the wiring in a relay . if the original wiring if fried, it cannot trip the 
relay, cause nothing is coming to it at all.
