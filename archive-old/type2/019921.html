Subject: stud replacement


Sorry all, my girl's not looking for a new guy. ;)  I'm looking for a
bit of advice (and/or prayers) on how to avoid breaking an exhaust stud.

I pulled off my heat exchangers to flush 'em out (no more noxious-fume
buzz), and am getting ready to put 'em back in.  While I was under
there, I was looking at the exhaust studs,
and am wondering what's gonna happen when I put everything back together
and wrench the heat exchangers down snug.  I'd really hate for any of
those studs to snap; if one breaks, what then?  Does the engine have to
come out?  Exactly what does a weak stud look like?  Can unbroken studs
be replaced with minimal effort and the engine in?  I know nothing, so
please feel free to share.  The studs in there now don't look too bad,
enough of thread on each of them.  They're a bit rusty, some more than
others. 

I'm in digest mode, so feel free to p-mail me.

Many thanks
-Roger

Oh yeah, and for anyone chasing down a backfire problem, pull out and
check your
heat exchangers.  I found the welds on one of the flanges had given
(really crappy weld-job -- one tack on each side), and though that
flange was torqued down nice, the pipe from the heat exchanger was free
to slide around.
