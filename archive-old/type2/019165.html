Hmmm, that's kinda hard, but I love a hypothetical.
I'd guess it'd be about a quarter of a star for vehicles with the
solid
steering shaft, up to maybe a whole three quarters of a star for the
collapsible shaft models!!!
A crash test simulates two vehicles hitting head on at about 60 km/h.
It
assumes both vehicles are deformable in some way, that's why they use
a
solid barrier and hit it with a test vehicle going at a lower speed.
Of course if you were to throw a spark into the equation with our
front
mounted tanks the result may be a bit lower ....
I could possibly find some &quot;happy snaps&quot; over at Highway Patrol or the
Crash
Investigation Unit, but they wouldn't be pretty .... ie they take pics
of
the worst prangs with the worst results.

&gt;
&gt;If the Type 1 were to be tested like any of todays modern cars what
&gt;would it's ratings be?  1 star head on collision or what?  Any good
&gt;websites out there besides the one with pictures of a Beetle with an
&gt;airbag crashing into a brick wall?
&gt;TIA
