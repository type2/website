Subject: Re: [T2] EB 02

There is a shopping center just a few miles away from EB. Otherwise 
we are out in the sticks.

After you get off the interstate and are heading down US 421 you come 
to the stop light that you turn right at to get to HST. If you were 
to take a left instead then you would arrive at a shopping center a 
few miles down the road.

&gt;Does anyone know the surrounding area at EB. I just want to know if 
&gt;there are places to shop near by or if I should pack all my 
&gt;perishable stuff for the  ride down from MA. Any help would be 
&gt;appreciated. See you there Woo Hoo.
