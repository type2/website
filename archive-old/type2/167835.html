Subject: quasi-Friday material

	Tenuous bus content  -  may need a smidgen of Friday excuse
	The accusation that our motors are mid-1930s design is heard 
from e.g media celebrity Clive 'Dog &amp; Lemon Guide', but is 
essentially misleading because of coure Porsche &amp; VW improved design 
&amp; construction for 4 decades.  (They then lost the plot, resorting to 
water cooling &amp; other blunders.)
