Subject: Re: [T2] '70 bus drum brakes, pulls to right, plainly just dont
  work right.

&gt;I know its simple to adjust, but are there things that
&gt;should be replaced like spring etc at this age?

If you have the time and are so inclined I would take the drum off 
(especially the front, you get most of your braking power from the front) 
and inspect the shoes for wear. Also make sure there's no grease as that can 
really limit your stopping ablity even when your shoes are good.

Shoes are fairly inexpensive and also they have a hardware kit for the 
springs and stuff. The pulling to the right maybe a sign that you need to 
adjust them, or it could be a collapsed brake hose.

The hardest part is getting the axle nut off. Good luck. Somewhere is an 
article on the web for some tricks to get it off if you don't have an impact 
wrench. I had my mechanic zapp them loose enough for me to get them off with 
a breaker bar.
