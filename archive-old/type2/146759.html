Subject: Electronic Ignition...

So, I'm doing my first tune-up at home.  I go out and buy new 
points/cap/rotor/condenser, come home, pop the top off the distributor, 
and lo and behold, it's an electronic ignition!

Do I need to do anything to maintain this unit except change the cap and 
rotor when they start looking worn?

Anyone know the average lifespan of an electronic ignition?  How about 
just the cap/rotor?  I should probably pick up a spare...
