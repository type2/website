Subject: Re: [T2] Gex Heads

Hi Tony,

In my experience, EVERY bus for sale seems to say either:

	1. Recently rebuilt or new engine.
or
	2. No engine/doesn't run.

They can't *all* be GEX victims, can they?

Hmmmmmmmmmm.

&gt; My
&gt; guess is that an awful lot of GEX motors end up in about to be sold 
&gt; VW's
&gt; so they can be advertised with &quot;rebuilt engine&quot; in the advert...The new
&gt; owner gets to pick up the pieces...
