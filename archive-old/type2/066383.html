Subject: Non-Westfalia pop-tops

Robert Taylor sez:
&gt;If there are any '71 ASI campers out there, they would be my

&gt;
&gt;Gentlefolk, start your encyclopedic memories! Does my 
&gt;dream bus exist?

Surfer Bob-

As a matter of fact, your dream bus does exist. ASI (actually, I thougt
it was AST) used to make an alternative to the Westfalia-brand pop-top
campers. They would by sunroof busses direct from VW, but without the
sunroof itself or any interior behind the cab. Then they would add their
own pop-top, folding bed, and cabinetry.

The ASI pop-tops are definitely more useful than the Westfalia
front-hinged ones. As you pointed out, the ASI tops go straight up,
rather than hinging from one end, and they have a double bed rather than
a single cot. One of their other advantages is that they cover the rear
section of the bus, not the front, allowing  a person to climb into the
upper bed without having to climb on the lower one, and preserving the
stand-up-to-put-on-your-pants headroom.

I don't think the ASI cabinetry is as nice as the Wesfalia versions. I
also think that the ASI tops, for some unidentifiable reason, don't look
as cool as the Westfalia ones. I've considered finding an ASI pop-top in
a junk yard and installing it in place of my Westfalia top, but so far I
can't bring myself to do it.

By the way, I think that ASI is still around. I think I've seen ASI
Vanagons and maybe even some ASI Toyota vans (the earlier ones, not the
Previas).

PS: Book chat: Here's my two cents on a couple books mentioned in
earlier posts: The People's Guide to Mexico, by Carl Franz and published
by Muir, is possible the best travel book ever published. It reads like
a novel, and contains both hilarious travel stories and genuinely useful
information that you'd never find anywhere else. He travels mostly by VW
bus, so there's a lot there for type-2ers.
Also, in the discussion of Grendel and mythology, someone mentioned a
book that tells the Beowulf story from the monster's point of view. It's
called &quot;Grendel&quot; and it's written by John Gardner. It's fantastic.
