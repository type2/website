Subject: Need help with the transmission

Hi! 
 
I'm desperately in need of some help. I have a 1978 Transporter. 
2 days ago I encountered this problem:While on the go, I was unable to 
put it into any gear (speed?), engine running fine, just no 
transmission. After much trying, I found speed &quot;3&quot;, and had to hold it 
in that position till reaching home, and unable to change to any other 
speed. 
(Sorry, if there is any confusion with my wording - I'm hungarian, 
with limited english in automotive topics) 
 
Once at home, I looked over the whole transmission which is visible 
from under. It looks like it didn't move the rod enough to change 
speed. There is no strange noise, or anything, just won't change. 
 
What should be the problem? And how can I repair it? 
Can anybody refer me to some webpage to see how should I uninstall the 
transmission system, and repair it, then put it back again? 
Or I would welcome any help by mail too - am only asking to please use 
regular words for parts and tools, or try to explain it to me, as the 
words used in automotive-repair texts are many times nonexisting ones 
in my dictionary :( 
I did much repair work on my bus, this is not a problem, but need 
words even your wife or mom would understand :) 
Thanks!
