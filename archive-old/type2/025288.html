Just finished this same operation on my '68.  There are PLENTY of other ups
you can do: electronic ignition (Petronix is popular with VW folks, I
installed a Crane system and coil), upgraded carbs (mine are now Weber IDF
40's) full flow remote oil filter (Bosch) and a nifty oil-cooling fan with a
thermostatic switch, new VDO tach and oil pressure guages...that's just the
stuff &quot;under the bonnet&quot;.  I'm still trouble-shooting small elictrical
problems under the dash.  There are SO many wires and it's no small feat to
keep them in order when I'm clutching the back of the driver's seats with my
knees, head resting comfortably on the clutch pedal.  Does anyone knoe if VW
designed the cockpit with this position in mind :).
Good Luck! the project is worth doing and Muir's advise about keeping
everything labeled and in little bags was really helpful for a first timer
like me.  If you don't have the idiot book, get it.  That and a
knowledgeable friend (or friends, like on this list) should make the
difficulties you face surmountable.
BTW is there anyone on the list who KNOWS what the under the dash wire
scheme is supposed to look like?  I mean before the previous owner installed
extras and my bass loving pal hooked up the killer stereo?  Keep us posted
on your progress.
