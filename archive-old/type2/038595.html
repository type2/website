Subject: New Bus Nightmare

For the last few months I've been looking for a bus and I appreciate the many 
helpful comments from many of you. I talked to many people and looked at 
pictures of many campers. I finally decided that I would go the &quot;mint route&quot;, 
given my lack of free time and my severe learning curve due to being new at 
this and no mechanical experience. I was patient, and thought I'd found my 
dream bus. Here's the nightmare. I want some of your opinions because I know 
I'm emotional about this. I purchased a '70 Dormobile from a guy in 
Chatanooga, Tn. It was fully restored. He has two other buses, and portrays 
himself as very experienced with them. He farmed out all body and paint work, 
but rebuilt the engine himself. He said it had 12k miles on total rebuild. He 
gave me the rundown on how he handled the break-in, and he was very careful, 
and changed oil very frequently. I had him make a video of the bus(30 mins.) 
and asked him to film everything good and bad, since he was so far away. I 
got the video and  fell in love. I made an offer of $7600,(asking $8000) he 
accepted with &quot; a few conditions&quot;. In retrospect here's where I think my red  
flag should have gone up.  When asked again about ANYTHING else I need to 
know before I fly one way 350 miles to get it, he tells me about some rust 
&quot;in a few places&quot;, and about &quot;one area&quot; where there wasn't proper prep work 
prior to painting, and its bubbling up some. I should have backed out right 
then. These things weren't shown in the video, which was the purpose of the 
damn thing in the first place! Anyway we arrange to meet and do the deal.
 When we met I ask him again if I was okay driving it 350 miles. He said &quot; 
I've driven it farther than that with no problems. We use it to camp often, I 
wouldn't hesitate to drive it across the country. I know the vehicle, I'm 
experienced, I did everything to spec., and you can trust this bus. He writes 
&quot;as is&quot; on the bill of sale. I ask him about this and he says&quot; you have to 
remember this is a 30 year old vehicle, so things can happen, but if you have 
any problems within a reasonable amount of time I'll work something out with 
you&quot;. The next morning it won't idle worth a damn, but I get through it, even 
though I'm in Atlanta traffic! The following morning I check the oil (fine), 
and excitedly start my journey! Eighty miles into ownership she throws a 
rod!!!
I pay $350 plus gas to get a U-haul and a trailer, and I bring it home to  
Mobile. The next day I trake it to a well-known VW shop an hour away who says 
he pretty sure its a rod, and he will let me know the extent of the damage 
next week. It will be a month before he thinks he can do anything more than 
diagnosis! Here's how I feel. I paid serious money  so I could avoid this 
kind of crap! I feel that 80 miles before a problem such as this is 
ridiculous and he should pay every bit of the truck/trailer rental as well as 
the repair. Of course he holds all of the cards, and I'm at the mercy of his 
conscious, a scary proposition these days, as honor can be as rare as a 
straight, rust free, good running Dormobile! How about some thoughts and 
therapy here! I want to know how you people feel. I also think he is on the 
list, and hopefully he will see this and want to do the right thing. Our 
initial two &quot;post-disaster&quot; conversations have not been extremely 
encouraging, although he hasn't told me to get lost yet!
