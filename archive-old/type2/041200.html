Subject: bus no start...

Hi all,
I have been viewing the list for a month now and have a problem with my Newly 
acquired 1979 bus.
When I bought the bus my bug buddies helped me to get it 
started.........(previous to purchase).....sweet sound...it ran for 30 
minutes....However we had to jump it from the battery to the 
starter.......key switch would not work . Key switch still springs back when 
turned but no start.....although all lights, etc do work...now it will not 
even do that...I purchased and installed a new starter
and battery with no luck......lights work but no start......help...

reliable........
