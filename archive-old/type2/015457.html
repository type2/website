&gt;Ok,
&gt;    This question is going to take some thought, and probably those that
&gt;have changed from FI to carbs will know what to do.
&gt;
&gt;I figure pressure should build up in the fuel line and stop.  Nothing is
&gt;leaking fuel.

Only with the later FI systems do you have this feature. As carburators are
typically designed to use mechanical pumps at much less pressure, the
safety issue of shuting off fuel delivery in the event of an accident does
not exist. Also, it is usless wear on the system to have it running if the
motor is not started. There is no such wear in a mechanical pump.

To set up an electric pump to feed carbs you need either a precisely
calibrated pump or an adjustable pump or a pressure regulator. 3 pounds
should feed your 44's just fine unless you put on a big bore set and/or
extractor, in which case you are so far from stock that you must conduct
your own experiment. With a stock motor and Webers set up with the proper
jets and balanced, they can run very nice even on a cam profile designed
for FI.

Put an switch in the pump circuit. When you want to turn the key on for the
radio or whatever, switch off the pump. Nice anti-theft item as well if you
hide the switch.

Some of the early Mercedes had a pressure relief with fuel return
incorporated in their carburated setups and with mechanical pumps. Check
the wrecking yards for something that might be adapted. Look for the dual
carburated modles of the 60's. Don't forget to nab some big time horns
while your at it.

Nothing like a T-II with Mercedes dual tone horns. Get outta my way, NOW. I
need the momentum!
