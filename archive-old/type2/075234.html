Subject: Re: [T2] Re: T2: Oily To Rise

&lt;&lt; Here's my reasoning: Under operating load conditions the internal engine

temps are going to be relatively constant regardless of the external air

temperature, so if we need to run a heavier oil in the summer to cool and

lubricate our engines, shouldn't we also need that same protection in the

winter? Also, does the alleged wear at startup do more damage than the wear

caused by extended operation with a light weight oil?


Any theories, ideas, two bit opinions?

Racers have a pricey option to the cold start...An external electric oil
pump that brings the oil and pressure up before engaging the starter.
Another &quot;solution&quot; is propane fuel which burns cleaner and doesn't
wash the cylinder walls as gas does. At over 100 octane, even allows 
for higher CR's for more efficency and cleaner exhaust. There was,
and still might be, an at-home refueling system - pretty sure this was
available in Canada for a while.
