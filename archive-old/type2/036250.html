Subject: WTT: one childs cot pole

Hey there volks,

I have one childs cot pole (57 1/4&quot;, 3 sided, fits 74-75) that I
would like to trade for one 2 piece, collapsible, 3 sided, that fits
the 76-79 westies.

Seems I got a mismatched set of poles (don't ask - but I bet that
somewhere, someone has the exact same setup). Storing the long one is
a pain in my 79, because my westy doesn't have the full length bench.

Barring a trade, I'm willing to buy the one collapsible pole. I know
this is a long shot, but you never know, unless you ask.

Thanks in advance,
