Subject: WTB/trade:74 heat exchangers

Subject says it...I'm looking for a pair....muffler too if anyone has
one...also found most of the p-tube cover &amp; front lower tinwork had
deteriorated badly since I was under there last....anyone got any of
this stuff to help an old busser get one back together....

Will buy or trade for a pair of NOS 914 heat exchangers for
1.8.....these are very rare items NOS.....worth $250 ea at least....

Thanks, Den..
