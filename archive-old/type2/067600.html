Subject: I-40 Busses (TN)

I was on a short road trip to see the parents and in-laws this
weekend, and my wife and I saw a few busses, and just wondered
if it was any of y'all....
This was along I-40 between Jackson and Knoxville, Friday 
afternoon and Sunday afternoon.
- -We saw a nice red '69 Westy at a McDonalds in Crossville, 
all decked out for family travel...NC plates.
- -Saw two loaded-down V-gons headed west, both in good shape, 
both westys with bike racks.
- -Saw a _nice_ yellow late '70s micro in Nashville, all 
passengers had on requisite heavy coats and gloves. They didn't
 know what to think of Nissan-driving couple ogling their Bus.
- -Harvest gold hardtop Westy cruising at 55 thru Nashville.  
Older lady driving, alone.
- -One EV spotted in Knoxville, kid hauler.

All in all, the most VW vans I've ever seen in one trans-TN
trip, and I've made quite a few (once a month for almost 5 yrs,
700 miles round trip).

Soon someone else will spot my bus making the Big Trip.
