Subject: Re: [T2] dual dellorto tuning

When tuning carbs, especially the idle mixture screw, there is no &quot;set&quot;
amount of turns.  Ever car is different...  Best way is to maybe go to this
baseline of 1 1/2 turns, get a tach/timing light on it, turn the screw a
quarter turn in, wait maybe 15 seconds, and watch the tach.........the motor
should start to stumble .....that is where you start.  then start turning
the screw out slowly 1/4 turn, pausing, watching tach, until you find the
point where you have the max idle speed.  You will know, for you will have,
say 900 rpms, and then turn out another quarter, and it goes to 880.  Then
switch to the other carb.  Get it set.  If you really want to get it right,
do this a few times.

I am not sure if your carbs have a balance tube between them but if they do,
do not pinch it.  If you want to get really precise, take the linkage off
the carb arms and set the mixture without that on.........also checking that
the distance on the throttle arms and the stop is the same on each carb.

Be sure valves are adjusted first, and timing is on........then tune the
carbs.
