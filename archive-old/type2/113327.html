Subject: Automatic trans for sale

I would like to sell the 73 auto trans and all that is needed to make a bus an 
automatic. I converted my 73 to a 4spd in hopes of better mileage. 
this vacuum controlled auto was used before they started using the jetta trans 
around 76?
I have the different lenght axles needed, the shift cable and console, torque 
converter etc.
need the moeny to pay back dad for all the parts and maybe recover my front 
seats.
would like to get $175, and would consider driving somewhere to meet in CT, MA, 
RI, NH, NY, or NJ since I travel in these araes

couls also ship by truck but that could cost$$$
