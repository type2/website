Subject: Re: [T2]Rear main seal (pics) ???

The black &quot;O&quot; ring(need a new one)goes on the
crankshaft,it seals the back of the fan hub.  The new
small seal, goes back in it's place, tap it in with a
block of wood so as to not damage the case, then put
the &quot;Fan Hub&quot; back in and torque the bolt to 18FP, put
the fan(Timing pully) back on and torque the three
bolts on it to 16FP, did it show signs of leakage
around the hub before you pulled it. From the pictures
I didn't see a lot of oil on the case. Phil
