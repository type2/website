Subject: I went and did it this time

I had heard about this doublecab a couple years ago. 
 Legend of this truck wove it's way around and through the 
local bus community, surfacing like a porpoise, just to 
vanish again as legends do.  No one seemed to know where 
it was but 'everyone' knew 'someone' who had seen it 
recently but 'nobody' could pin it down.  Word was it was 
a bit rough, needing work but no one knew exactly what.

I was over at the local aicooled garage (John does 
waterpumers too but I still like him anyways)and mentioned 
I had been looking for a doublecab for a while.  He said 
he knew where one was and if I was interested we could go 
look at it sometime.

Today was sometime because the tree job I was supposed to 
go do fell through because my ground man disappeared 
yesterday.  He does that sometimes and surfaces again a 
while later.

Of course, you already figured out, I now own the 
legendary doublecab.  It's a 68 in dire need of floors and 
some rocker work and some brakes and an engine (maybe). 
 It still has the welding company stickers on the doors. 
I've got one and a source for more hoods to use for 
donormetal of the german variety so I need to find cargo 
floor and interrior floor sections.

Any of you metalmongers and weld splatterers know of 
doublecab floor sources?  Any and all leads appreciated. 
 Oh yeah pix available shortly at
