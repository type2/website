Subject: RE: VDO tachometer problem

&gt;I put in a VDO tachometer and it works.I got a 74 2L carb.
&gt;The only thing which needs some attention is that the rmp 
&gt;vary a lot when driving at a constant speed. 

Most VDO tachs that I've seen have dip switches on them to select for 4,6, or 8 
cylinder installations.  I remember reading on the list a few months ago that 
someone's brand-new VDO instructions were in error on the switch settings.  So 
you might want to contact VDO and make sure your switches are right.

Is the tach new?  Or if not, did you see it working properly in another car?  
Sometimes tachs go bad.  If you've got access to another tach, that would be 
the easiest way to very that it is functioning correctly or not.  If another 
tach reads the same then you've got a problem in the back or your wires are 
bad.  

Wires:  Make sure you're getting a good solid 12V on your positive wire hooked 
to the tach and that your ground wire hooked to the tach is also a good one.  
You can also check the continuity of your tach's pulse wire (the one running 
from the coil) with an OHM meter.

At the back:  Points have a very big effect on a tach.  Check your dwell with a 
dwell meter and make sure you're in spec.  You might also want to hook up a 
timing light and see how bad your timing is jumping around (due to worn 
distributor or points).

&gt;If I drive around 60mph the tachometer shows around 4000rpm 
&gt;in 4th gear! Is this correct and schould it be like this, or
&gt;is this too high?

That is not correct unless you're running very small tires (like a 185/60/14 or 
worse).  With the correct size tire (or pretty close too it 185/14, 195/70/14, 
195/75/14) your bus should turn about 4000 RPM at about 70 mph.  So if you're 
tires are right, then either the speedo is ready way to low (unlikely) or your 
tach is reading to high (more likely).
