Subject: Re: [T2] 74 Bus --Carburetor problems?

&gt; Stuck or bad float valve. Sunk float. Loose jets. Rebuild and readjust to
fix.

&gt; &gt;noticed a strong gas smell and gas dripping from the
&gt; &gt;carburetor....

Ruptured accelerator pump was the cause of this on my 34 PICT-3.  Like the
Doktor says, rebuild it, which at least in the case of my old-school carb
was incredibly easy, like a one-hour job all in.  Enjoy!
