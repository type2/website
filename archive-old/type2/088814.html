Subject: Sunshine Hill Campout in Bonner Springs , KS

Hi Volks,

Full Moon Bus Club and Sunshine would like to invite you to our next
campout.. Only 11 days away, Sunshine Hill is in Bonner Springs, KS. July
12-14, 2002 http://www.geocities_dot_com/freeskingdom/index1.html There will be
2 ponds to swim in (the biggest one is the swimming pond, near the
campsite), so bring floatation devices to waste the day away.


Sat morning will be the World Famous FMBC Breakfast Burritos &amp; Sat afternoon
we will be doing tie dyes.


Sat evening Sunshine's brother Shane will be cooking out chicken and
Sunshine will make Potato soup for the veggies. Any side dishes would be
appreciated.


Cost for camping is FREE but a Tree or one perennial flower that you get to
plant would be a nice donation. Help Sunshine get some Trees on her land...
:)

If you plan on coming, please bring a donation for the fire side raffle. We
will be giving the prizes away before the case fire Sat nite.


{{Look forward to special *souvenirs* for Sunshine Hill 2000 that will be
given away to everyone that arrives at Sunshine Hill, these are being
personally made by Sunshine herself.}}



For more info please check out the official site at
http://www.geocities_dot_com/freeskingdom/index1.html  There is also a link to
the grocery list for the communal cooking. For more info email Sunshine at
vwbusgirl_at_kc.rr_dot_com  Please help out if coming.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy

Not a location.
