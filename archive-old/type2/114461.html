Jon,

&gt; I just cleaned my oil bath filter.  Wasn't too bad.
&gt;
&gt; After I added 30 weight oil and reassembled it, I sucked air through 
&gt; the
&gt; outlet that leads to the carb. I expected to hear the air being sucked
&gt; through the oil. Like a bubbling sound or something.
&gt;
&gt; Instead, there wasn't really any noise, or resistance to indicate the
&gt; air was being drawn through the oil. Can anyone clue me in to the
&gt; function of the oil bath filter? Should I be hearing anything?

The air cleaner sorta works on a cyclone principle.  The air is brought 
into the chamber of the filter by manifold vacuum (by way of the carb). 
  The heavier particulates &quot;precipitate&quot; out and are trapped in the oil 
reservoir in the bottom of the filter.  The smaller stuff is drawn 
through the filter medium (a loosely woven material that stays soaked 
with oil from sloshing around I guess) where it sticks to all that 
oil-coated stuff.

It doesn't work like a bong.
