Subject: grrrrrrrrrinding 3rd &gt; 2nd gear

2nd time to post about this, sometimes is hard to avoid grinding when 
downshifting from 3rd to 2nd gear.

Adjusted clutch, seems to be correct adjustment.  I can avoid the grinding 
by shifting into nuetral, giving it some good gas, then giving it gas as i 
ease it into 2nd.

Why does this help?

What else can I do?

Thanks in advance,
Daniel
