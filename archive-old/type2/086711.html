Subject: Re: [T2] '73 fuel tank exhaust


I have a '78 and replaced all of these fittings by simply going to Home
Depot and buying the right size plastic T's. I think they were 1/4 &quot; or
maybe 5/15&quot; look where they sell tubing. I also replaced all the little
rubber hose sections with 8mm vacuum line from FLAPS. I added hose clamps
to all of the fittings to be sure nothing would leak. No worries. Problem
solved. Now the T's are not metric and I don't know if they are rated for
gasoline service but none have shown any signs of deterioration in 3
years...

&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt;
&gt; In my '73, the fuel tank exhaust lines reconnect at the top of the engine
&gt; compartment just inside the rear hatch.  They reconnect in a rubber
&gt; T-section piece that then connects to an air filter.  Does anyone know
where
&gt; I can find a replacement T-section?  Mine has rotted away and I can't
seem
&gt; to find another anywhere.  I've tried catalogs and websites with no luck.
&gt; I'm also interested in the other connectors that are a part of the fuel
tank
&gt; exhaust system, but the T-section is what I need the most.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Brian
&gt;
