&gt; &gt; How old does a VW have to be before it does not need converting to US specs

&gt; &gt; bugs (looking for busses) and would like to know the cut-off dates.
&gt; Funny you should ask...
&gt; 
&gt; I was curious and checked out the DMV website, and anything 25 years or
&gt; older is exempt.
&gt; 
&gt; Thus, at this time 1975 model year and older has no hoops to jump through.

The DMV is regulation at the state level, while if you are importing from
abroad you have to deal with the feds (DOT, EPA, BATF etc.)  Your DMV
doesn't even have a chance to say &quot;NO&quot; until the feds get done with you!

PS, the &quot;BATF&quot; above was a joke, unless your bus has some _really_ unusual
equipment!  :)
