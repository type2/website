Subject: Re: [T2] Better gas mileage by attaching a metal garbage can
  lid to  front mounted spare?

The spare in front that produced less wind resistance
in my testing over the years had an insert of
corrugated plastic to keep the tight-fitting vinyl
cover nice and flat in front. A large rounded style
hubcap would probably be even better. -BaH

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Some years ago, a bus owner told me that he had
&gt; attached a metal
&gt; garbage can lid to his front mounted spare, and it
&gt; increased his
&gt; gas mileage.  Has anybody tried this?
&gt; 
&gt; I am guessing that the principle would be similar to
&gt; the bulbous
&gt; submerged part of the bow on (some?) supertankers.
