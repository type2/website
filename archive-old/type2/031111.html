&gt; Ok kids, we're getting close to the next leg, but we have some gaps that, if

&gt; Specifically, we'd like to see some folks in the Richmond, VA area. We need
&gt; to get the baton this direction, and have no drivers currently signed up for
&gt; this area. The driving would likely be this weekend, so you'd need to be
&gt; available.

now if you can find someone in Norfolk or Richmond area the way I sugested
would be the perfect routing.  however the Roanoke to Alexandria/Baltimore
leg would be a bear otherwise.  And I am nursing a weak bearing at the
moment...have the spare in hand just not yet on bus.
