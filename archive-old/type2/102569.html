Subject: Horsepower

Let me get this straight:

The type 1 single port 1600cc engine yeilds 57 Horsepower

The Type 1 dual port 1600cc engine yeilds 60 HP

the Type 4 2000 cc engine yeilds 67 HP

So, they all seem to offer very close HP ratings ..... Am I right? What is
the big advantage of type 4 engines other than Fuel injection and hydraulic
lifters? Especially when it seems the cost of parts is like double that of a
type 1 engine.
