Correction...Make that &quot;Bob's&quot; fix...sorry Bob.

&quot;the cure is to swage the valve seats after instalation

have never (knock on wood etc) had a swaged valve seat drop

&lt;snip&gt;. The diesel
seats and David's idea are a good approach.  However, even if you keep the
seats in thru brute force that doesn't address the cause which is our
common, old enemy...too much heat.

Can you tell us more about your oil cooler fan solution Jake?  I don't know
the setup but it sounds &quot;cool&quot;.  Are sodium valves still available and if so
are they advisable?
