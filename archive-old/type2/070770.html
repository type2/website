Subject: WT Trade: nearly new 009 for Cal ignition stuff
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Listers, I hope I'm not making a boo-boo here. I read the charter and found 
no restrictions on WTS, WTB, or WTT.

I bought a bus with an 009 with just a few hours on it, but want to go to a 
dual vacuum system like Karl described (archives). I'm building this bus up 
for my teenage son, who intends to take a whole-country tour next summer, and 
I want it to be as troublefree as it possibly can be.

I would like to trade this 009 for the following items from a 79 Cal bus or a 
80-83 Cal Vanagon:
heatsink w/ignition module (also from early Rabbit or Audi)
distributor harness from module to dist. to coil 
bosch electronic coil (from a Rabbit)

TIA/CarronRockford TN
Type2 content...it all goes on &quot;China Cat&quot;, the former Grateful Dead &quot;tamale 
bus&quot; :-)
