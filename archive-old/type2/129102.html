Subject: Slider latch gives way '79

Ayup, went to open my slider yesterday, and with the gentlest of clinks,
something gave way inside and now no latch function at all.  '79 westy.

It's not the lock - that seems to be fine.

Anyone know what I need for this repair?  Got the parts?  

Do I disassemble the latch assembly from inside to repair?  I figure I
should wait 'till I have parts before I take it apart???

Thanks!

Teri
