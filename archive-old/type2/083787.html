Subject: Dizzy hold-down clamp stud

Volks,
In the process of installing a &quot;new&quot; dizzy (thanks Karl) the stud that secures
the hold-down clamp to the case has started to pull out.  It is a 1600 DP
engine, AE case.  I would like to know if that stud is in a blind threaded hole,
or a thru hole.  In other words, can I go ahead and get it out and rethread for
a larger stud, or am I going to get shavings into my case if I do?  I have the
engine out now, but it is fully assembled, except for the dizzy, and I would
really, really hate to have to crack case to repair that stud.  Thanks for all
replys.
