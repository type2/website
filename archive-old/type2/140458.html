Subject: front seat discomfort

 I'm sure you're gonna get the responses about Vanagon seats - but, I had my 
seat covers on my 78 removed as the piping was loose in two longish places 
on both.  So ... they removed the covers completely.  Took the seat part of 
the cover and took the seam apart - they put the piping inside new clear 
piping then reassembled the seat cover (the back cover was OK).  They put 
new high tech seat upholstery stuffing on both the seat part and backrest 
part - and reassembled the seats.  They switched driver and passenger as the 
driver seat had more wear on both cover and springs.  My seats are awesome - 
but it did cost about $300.00 Cdn.
