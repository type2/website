Well I hate to admit it, but I also painted mine with rustoleum. I
sandblasted em and then primered em and then I just sprayed them with
rustoleum. They looked good for a while but I have black brake powder from
my front brakes and it adheres nicely to my rustoleum. I have scrubbed them
and can't get all of it off. I suggest a lot of coats and maybe a clear coat
too. They did look really good though.

&gt; &gt; time it is going to be too expensive.  so, i was wondering if any
&gt; &gt; of you out there have painted your rims yourself.  please report on the
&gt; &gt; materials you used as well as long term results. i really dont want the
&gt; &gt; paint to start chipping/flaking 6 months down the road.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; just cleaned mine real good and then painted em with Rustoleum....3 years
&gt; ago and still no problems.  (wrought Iron Black is a great flat black
&gt; color)
