Subject: Emmisions hose goes where?

     This is for a 1979 fuel injected federal bus, basically stock.

     Okay, I'm trying to figure out where one of the emmisions hoses go.  
This clear hose comes from the BOTTOM of the charcoal canister.  The same 
type of clear (used to be anyway) vinyl hose comes from the top of the 
charcoal canister to the air cleaner assembly.  This one goes from the 
bottom of the canister to no-where!

Here is a great pick of the hose that is connected correctly at the top of 
the canister:

And at tha air cleaner on the other end:

     Now imagine the bottom of the charcoal canister has a clear hose 
attached to it just like the top one that goes to the air cleaner in the 
first links.  That clear tube doesn't connect anywhere other than the 
charcoal canister???

    Where is it suppose to go?
