Subject: Bus Depot is Hiring!

Once again, as our summer college help goes back to school, we are in dire
need of more employees.

We have several immediate openings for both full-time (weekdays 11-7) and
part-time (weekdays 11-3 or 4) help. We also could use temporary help until
we secure permanent help.  These are entry-level positions, but with
opportunity for advancement.

We are located in Perkiomenville PA, about an hour or less from
Philadelphia, Allentown, or Reading.

Please email me, or call Dan at 215-234-VWVW if interested.
