Subject: Re: [T2] baseline run  made  ??? is oil way to high??

Just finished a messy job.  After everything looked perfect and no tin 
probs found i pulled the sender.  I pulled another out of the bin and 
put them both and a thermometer in an oil bath and checked the readings 
from the senders.  no problems found there either then i noticed that 
one of the senders had the probe further up.  I installed that one and 
temps dropped 30 degrees.  the one style of sender wasnt picking up oil 
temp.

&gt; Oil temp is way too high around town.  It should be much lower in stop 
&gt; and go traffic than on the freeway (mine averages 30 degrees lower).  
&gt; All I can suggest is to double-check all of your tin for leaks and your 
&gt; fan for blockage.  Make sure your idle is not set too low also - I keep 
&gt; mine around 1000 rpm.

&gt;&gt; oil temp climbed to 270 range heads 320 degree high 290 low
&gt;&gt; used the highway 6 to 25 around east to 6th/225 avg speed 60
&gt;&gt; oil  dropped  to about 240  heads going uphill 370 to 400 flat  level
