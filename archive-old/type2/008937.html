Help!

I went to start my bus this morning, put the key in
the ignition and turned it, but it only went to the
&quot;on&quot; position and wouldn't advance any further. That
was when I realized the key wasn't all the way into
the ignition! I tried to turn the key back &quot;off&quot;, but
it wouldn't turn. Tried to get the key in all the way,
no go.

I've tried to free it up with wd40, but still no joy.
It feels completely frozen. I can see down inside the
switch and at least one of the tumblers is still in
the &quot;off&quot; position.

I have tried to get the ignition switch out to get a
better look, but I can't seem to figure that out
either! Bentley and Muir were no help whatsoever.
Bentley showed some nice photos, but the switch he
shows is different than mine. Mine doesn't have the
little set screw holding it in.

Someone PLEASE tell me I can do this w/out pulling the
steering wheel!!! That's a *serious* PITA!

Also, how does the electrical section of this switch
come off?! If I can get this loose, at least I'll be
able to drive.

Any ideas?
