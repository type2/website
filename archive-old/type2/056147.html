Hello All,
	I was just pondering over some things on my '72 1700 CC bus when
my mind came to the carb. It's the Weber 32/36 Progressive with electronic
choke. I was doing some tuning and noticed that when the engine is
running, I can pull the plug wires off of cylinders 1 &amp; 3 with almost NO
change in idle. Compression on this engine is 120-125 all the way around,
and the heads are not too old (300 miles). The carb and intake are new.
The carb sits square over the engine. My thinking is that the primary
barrel is closer to the 2 &amp; 4 side of the engine, hence they are getting
most of the gas out of the carb. This isn't good, is it? Also, when it
comes winter time (or even summer!), what on earth is to prevent this carb
from icing? I don't have money for dual carbs at this point, but I need
this thing to be reliable. Is there any way to do it with this carb? I'm
returning the engine to a stock exhaust (currently it has an extractor
installed by the PO). I'm hoping this will help significantly. Once I get
the new extractor on, I also have a vacuum advance dizzy to place in
there, and the carb will be re-jetted by a Weber man (been building race
cars all his life, restored engines for the Smithsonian, good guy). What
can I do to make this carb reliable 5 out of 4 seasons a year, and run
well, and get good mileage?


Thanks,
John Tracy
