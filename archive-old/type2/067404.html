&gt;Age:  Well, amazingly not as old as I thought.  I had always figured
&gt;      myself an old fart at 42, but find myself pleasantly in the (well,
&gt;      alright, at the high end of the) middle range of the group. 


Nah, Steve it's Unca' Joel who's the &quot;OF&quot; here. I'm serious. I've sat 
around a campfire with him after he's devoured a plate of beans. Mongo 
ain't got nothing on him. ;-)

Cheers,
