Subject: Re: aftermath of overheated engine

How long do busses last?  My '57 singlecab had hundreds-of-thousands, but
no good measure.  I suspect they never die completely barring accident ):

Well, maybe not -- it kinda depends on where you are...  In eastern California
Nevada, eastern Oregon (you know -- deserts) the metal body lasts forever.
Plastic and rubber parts last weeks.  I suspect that &quot;Cal Look&quot; rubber
started after people saw what those chrome-plastic strips looked like after
a few weeks in mountain-desert sun.  My '86 has such home-grown Cal-Look'ers,
all black except the little bit of metal that joins the ends...  I often
have to get new tires because the sun killed 'em.  Lots of tread left, but the
sides all cracked to hell.  You should see what the steering rubber bits
do!

The ol' singlecab went through a passel o' engines, too.  and a couple of
tranny's, and front-ends...

In the east, where they put salt on the roads (instead of properly using
habaneros) rust eats the body before you wear out the tires.  One season in
New Hampshire and my LandCruiser has holes in it!

But they last forever, depending on how much work you want to do.  I
once drove a rust-eaten MGA from the east to LA, bought a body in a junk yard,
merged the two and sold it (back east again!).  It was perfect.  Is it the
same car?  As which?

You were asking about the engine, really, I think.  I always considered the
typeI engines as being a consumable item on my VWs, like tires.  I think I
went through more engines than tires, though.  Many VW's have been over 500k,
but I don't know how long the record is for an engine.  I was always happy
with about 50k, but most VW folks would cringe at that.  I don't know the
record.  I remember a Beetle that passed a million miles, but that was on
more than ten engines, so it averaged 100k on an engine.  I recall it went
through more than one tranny, many brakes...
