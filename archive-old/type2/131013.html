Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuilt 2.0 FI - worst case scenario

Sorry I cant help with the question, but I do have some advice if you tear
it down again.  Take pictures, a lot of them.  I hope you have a digital
camera, since its so easy to take a bunch of pics.  I took over 200 pics of
my engine during the process of teardown, rebuild.  It turned out that I was
worried about the same thing, that I might have put the cam in one tooth off
by accident.  I went back to my pictures, and saw one of when I was
reassembling the case, and I had specifically taken a pic of the cam/crank
alignment.  That told me right off that it was fine.

Just a suggestion for next time, will help with troubleshooting.  Good luck.
