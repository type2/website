&gt; Check the archives. Hoover actually did work on this a few years
&gt; ago, but felt it was too much of a PITA to be practical. This may have
&gt; changed. I just searched on &quot;veeduber propane&quot; and found one of his
&gt; posts, a few more creative searches should yield more info...

&gt;From what I've heard, Hoover's propane engine has been consigned to the
Backyard of Good Intentions. Try Zamboni. No kidding. (Their website is
http://www.zamboni_dot_com) Zamboni used to build its ice resurfacing machines
with aircooled VW power, and Zambonis don't wear out so parts would have to
still be available.
