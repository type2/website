Subject: Re: [T2] turning a seat in to a cooler (was Buses &amp; the Dead)



&gt;I am interested in turning the single seat in the back into a cooler.  This
is the seat that is in between the closet and table.

I have a 40 quart igloo cooler with a 12v cooling chip in it.  Used about 4
or 5 amps, but it really works.  It would be great for keeping stuff cold
that was already cold when it went in.

Got it for about $50 on ebay.  You can lay it flat and put a cushion on top,
and there's your seat.

I'd probably skip the drain, as it only weighs a couple of pounds.  If you
wanted one, how about the fittings for a toilet inlet?  These come in cheap
kits with all the plastic hardware.  You'd cut off the tall stem.

Regards,

Grant
