&gt;hey jack don't bother on my account I'm going another route it looks, if
&gt;you'd like to see if they still actually are there and post to the list,
&gt;please do.


I stopped by there and inquired about Weber Cams.  There's a white
and red sign on top of a brown quonset hut.  [WEBER CAMS]  The guy
there said that the previous owner (Harry) passed away a couple years
ago and at that time the business became defunct.  The guy said he did
not paint over the sign out of respect.

Sorry, Weber Cams on Superior Avenue is not in business anymore.
