Subject: Fan Squealing revisited- the simple things

Ahhhh.  The simple things.  After playing with the fan
shroud for a few days, re-aligning and tightening
everything down a few dozen times, it occurred to me
that the fan didn't make the noise when I turned it
without the fan belt.  It turned freely.  Also, it
didn't make the noise when the engine was warm.  

I adjusted the belt to what I thought was ok, but a
mechanic friend said it was too tight.  Apparently, I
was pushing it in &quot;like a gorilla&quot; to get my 1/2 inch
of deflection.  He says, &quot;No, use your pinky if you
have to.  It should deflect easily.  Belt's too
tight.&quot;  I also noticed that the belt (Gates?) was
slightly wider than the Conti and wouldn't adjust
properly with only eight shims.  

Put on the Conti and didn't use my gorilla strength
while adjusting it.  No squeal now.  

Happy Bussin'
