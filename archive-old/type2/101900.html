Subject: Re: [T2] Snow tires...was[T2] re: Tire twist

I just bought a set of new Nokian Hakkapeliita C2 snow tires for my bus.  
They're 185/R14, 8 ply C rated tires.  Cost was about $115 Cdn/each.  That's 
about $75 US, I think.

I've yet to try these out on my bus, even though there's lots of snow up 
here in Toronto.  Unfortunately, some kindof FI problem is resulting my fuel 
mixture being too rich... and that's keeping my bus off the road until I fix 
it.  But I had tires just like these on my Subaru before I sold it last 
summer, and they were extraordinarily good.

Availability is slim, but I know for a fact that there's at least 8 of these 
tires in North America right now.
