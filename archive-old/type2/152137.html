&gt; &gt; might have to lower engine an inch or three
&gt; &gt;
&gt; And there is the key to doing it. Just like for removing the engine in a
&gt; late bay. Get a jack under the motor. Remove the two bolts that hold the
&gt; transmission up (they are a pain to reach but ...). Lower the engine as
&gt; much as necessary (but watch the angle, don't want to bend your shift
&gt; coupler).

and I have it even easier since I have an auto tranny shift linkage is a
cable.

&gt; You can get a WHOLE LOT of extra room just by pulling those two bolts and
&gt; never have to unbolt the engine from the tranny.

don't forget the mustache bar
