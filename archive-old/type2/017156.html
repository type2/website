Yeah, Great news

Anyway, if we had email addresses for the local Walnut Police Force and
Prosecutors etc.. we could all email the police and encourage them to take
this bus theft seriously.  Who knows, maybe a cop would actually give up
some of his doughnut time and work a little harder to get arrest more people
involved in Bus theft.

Ya sell your VIN tag - the bus that is stolen could be your own!
