Subject: Westfalia Range Light

I was surprised to learn that VW no longer stocks the
small halogen light used in my 1980 Westfalia.  This 
tiny halogen lights up the whole camper.  When they
did stock this a couple years ago, VW wanted $41 for
the light bulb.  I found an acceptible replacement at
Wall Mart for around $4.  It's a GE Halogen 891.  It
seems good, but is a slight bit less bright.

Anyone have occassion to look for a replacement for
this bulb?  I didn't try boating stores.  I remember
seeing German boat lights with tiny halogens.  In lieu
of the perfect replacement, however, the  GE bulb
seems good.

At some point, probably in the mid to late 80s
Westfalia changed to a flourescent light.  Anyone know
what year they swithced?
