so i'm on this mission to get my new bus up and running and have been 
spending my spare time staring at the engine and books and just looking for 
problems to fix.  i've checked out a bunch of stuff so far, and after 
today's work i have the pleasure of reporting that my bus, which was bought 
without the ability to idle, is idling!!! now, the there are still problems, 
mainly the fact that the idle is rough, doesn't adjust well when the idle 
screw is turned, and she's running hot and smokey!!
so there are still problems, but at least i have an idle to work with.

now, i'm still waiting for the bentley manual so in the meantime i'm using 
chilton's and muir.   from reading the material given, which is sparse for a 
'78 bus, i am led to believe that the EGR valve and deceleration valve need 
checking.  big problem!!! i can't find either in my engine!  supposedly the 
EGR valve should be pretty much on top of #4 cylinder, but all i have there 
is a metal tube coming from the throttle area that disapears into the tin.  
so where are these mysterious components?  i want to see and touch them.

and also, can anyone give me a push in the right direction as far as what my 
problem might be?  basically rough idle, gray/white smoke coming out of the 
exhaust that is very hot....

and finally, (i'm a very curious fellow....), how is the screw in the air 
sensor adjuste, or should it be left alone?  i read about it enriching or 
leaning out the air or something............

thanks in advance.....

mark.
