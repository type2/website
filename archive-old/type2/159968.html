Subject: Re: [T2] Camper Window Help

Problem solved, turns out the seal for the louver
window has two grooves, an obvious one for the louver
frame and the other not-so-obvious for the rear of the
screw-rails.  I only had the main groove seated, the
second one had to be jammed into place 1/4&quot; at a time
with a flathead...rather tedious.  After that the
windows went in, but still a huge PITA...
