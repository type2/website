&gt;i recieved this message from a fellow member of the list......i originally was
&gt;interested in putting a beetle engine in my 72 van..( recently aquired cheap!!
&gt;with no engine).......it seems that this is a factory set up at least in
&gt;europe.  ( a rebuilt beetle engine can run a fraction of the cost of a type iv
&gt;rebuild)

A few years back when I was just starting to collect the late model buses,
I too thought why not put a type 1 engine in a really nice '75 bus.  I too
had heard that in europe, a lot of the late busses ran the upright and even
some vanagons too.  The cost of rebuilding is higher (maybe 1/3 to 1/2 as
much as a modified type 1), so why not save some money and put in a engine
that is easy to remove and work on.

At that time, I had rebuilt a couple hundred type 1 engines and being an
auto/machine shop/welding teacher, the fabrication part didn't bother me.
So welding up a custom rear support bar, fabricating the sheet metal (some
people think it is stock) and rewiring and installing a large oil cooler on
the drivers side of the engine bay, I soon had my  freshly built 1776 in a
very nice original '75.  I even went so far as to locate an early low gear
transaxle and install the late bell housing with the supports on top.  I
wanted the lower gears to help with the lower hp.

But after running the bus a few thousand miles, the 3-4 head started coming
loose.  After 30K it was obvious that the type 1 engine was not going to
stand up to the higher speed and weight of the late model bus.

If I had it to do again, I wouldn't!  I would save the time and money it
cost to install the type 1 and build a reliable type 4 engine.  If you
really start adding it up, it cost about the same to install either engine,
but the type 4 engine will outlast the type 1 at least 3 times as long.  So
which is the better deal?  But if I hadn't had tried it for myself, I
wouldn't have learned an important lesson.
