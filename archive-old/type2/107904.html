Subject: Part Number Gurus Report!

Hello again, Volks.

Checked EKTA, no joy.  Part number 022 129 607.  I purchased what
was advertised (repeatedly!) as a 2.0L air filter box from a
vendor on thesamba_dot_com, and it arrived today.  Much to my
chagrin, it ain't - at least from what I can tell - for a 2.0L
Type IV VW.  Similarities, yes... but even my novice eye noticed
the odd square-in-a-rectangle-with-a-gasket air fitting.

Anyone know what model this part is *really* for?  I'm guessing a
1.7, but I could be wrong - a general search of the part number
showed 1.7L Porsche 914, but the picture was very different.

If you know, drop me a line... I'm ready to ZIP out the old &quot;you
defrauded me&quot; email already.

(P.S.  All you folks that have the 'secret' part number catalog
in your heads and gloveboxes should consider making a valiant,
charitable effort and posting it on the type2_dot_com site.  Imagine
the service done for your brothers and sisters!)

Cheers,
