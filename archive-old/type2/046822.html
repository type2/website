Sure have. My old ' 78 Westy sold for 8200.00 last year. It was 99.9% 
restored, (and I won't even tell you how much money I actually had in it, 
excluding my own labor...) The present ' 78 that I own would go for more than 
that, IF I had a mind to sell it, which I will do only if hell freezes over. 
It is insured for an agreed apon value of 12500.00, and not a week goes by 
when I don't have someone offer me 9000.00+ for it. What a change from 10 
years ago, eh? ( keep in mind that these are East Coast busses...Don't see 
too many of 'em in perfect shape on this side of the Mississippi!)
