I have replaced the sender in my 78 twice without drilling any holes or

YES it is a very tight fit but it is possible and can be done,  check the
archives for some of the tricks

&gt; Willis,
&gt; 
&gt; I have had two Vans (70 and 77) that have had access holes cut above the 
&gt; fuel tank sender by previous owners. The 70 had two pretty ham handed holes. 
&gt; The first was off target.
&gt; 
&gt; I have pulled a gas tank on a 77 Bus and it was no fun but I share your 
&gt; sense of danger in cutting metal above the tank. I would drain it and blow 
&gt; air thu it until all fumes were gone. Also get the location information with 
&gt; out cutting test holes.

&gt; &gt;Hey,
&gt; &gt;has anybody done the replacement without pulling the engine, like the 
&gt; &gt;archives suggest.
&gt; &gt;The guy says to cut a hole in the body to access it and re cover it with a 
&gt; &gt;plastic screw on boat hatch.
&gt; &gt;sounds risky to me, but I'd like to know for sure how much gas I have, the 
&gt; &gt;needle drops to R after I have a half tank or less.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Also does anybody know a good replacement for the rear table leg on 76-79 
&gt; &gt;westys?
&gt; &gt;I'm considering buying a peice of conduit and bending it, but don't know 
&gt; &gt;the diameter or height to bend at.
