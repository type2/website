Subject: NAPA horrors

i asked a NAPA guy if he had 10wt soi can  break in a motor... older 
guy behind the counter YELLED at me for 10 minutes about how NO-ONE 
used it for breakin, they all use whatever the manufacturer says to 
use in daily service, nobody has done that since the 50s, it wasn't 
hardly available anymore, etcetc.
i put my other purchases on the counter with a 'i'll take that as a 
no&quot; and left.

&quot;Why of course the people don't want war. . . . That is understood. But,
after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy 
and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it 
is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliamnent, or a 
communist
dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to 
the  bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell 
them they  are being attacked, and denounce the peacemakers for lack 
of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same 
in any country.&quot;
