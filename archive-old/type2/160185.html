Hi Volks,

Since this conversation seems to involve buses on snow, I can't help  
by hijack this thread in hopes of plugging the True Canadian Winter  
Bus Camp-out. There's just 4 months until the next major Canadian Bus  
Campout... February 17th near Hamlton Ontario.

We bring along a HUGE pile of firewood and then eat like Kings in  
order to stay warm. Pitch the diet for a weekend and relax knowing  
that 3000 calories per day is the break-even point for winter camping.

See this page for more info and pics from past events.

Happy Trails,

&gt; For those who need a good snow and don't have $200 a tire to

&gt; about 10 of the Vredesteins available at $109 each. Exceed all Bus  
&gt; specs of
&gt; course (or I wouldn't sell them), and have an excellent reputation.
