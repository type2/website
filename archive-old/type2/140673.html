Subject: Re: [T2] BusDepot Website Navigation / Finding Parts

Not trying to bash you just a few observations...


&quot;and sometimes better is not better,,,...for many of us who don't like the
 latest and greatest, or have slow connections, or maybe accessing from a
 PDA or cell phone.  fancy is not easier to use.  there really needs to be
 a basic button.  for text only and fast downloading...&quot;

Does anyone actually try to surf real websites from a cellphone? I've never
had any luck with anything other then really basic mostly text sites that
are specifically designed for cellphones.

Do other auto parts stores offer really basic / text only versions of their
websites?

If your stuck on the side of the road with an 3G internet browser cellphone
IMO your probably much better off just having BD's phone number in your
phonebook and calling them! Browsing the net on a phone is an exercise in
frustration. That's what laptop cellphone connection cords are for.

&quot;so 99% of the time I make a long distance phone call to waste Ron's
 employee's time answering my questions and getting the right part.  but at
 least I get the part and I get it fast.  just as long as Ron remembers
 that his business is selling top line VW parts at fair prices I don't care
 what else he does...&quot;

It's called customer service and making a sale, I doubt Ron considers that a
waste of his employees time. That's why he has a phone number after all. ;-)
