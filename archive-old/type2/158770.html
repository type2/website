Subject: Re: [T2] plastic brake hose 76 bus

Hey Chai!
While I don't know what the hose is made of, for these sorts of  
things I always just call an industrial hose supplier and purchase  
suitable hose by the foot.

I don't know where you are geographically but down here in Tucson we  
have a great industrial hose outfit called 'Granberry'.  They've had  
every type of hose I've ever needed.

Were I in your shoes I'd call hose suppliers, tell them you need  
hydraulic oil compatible hose in whatever inside diameter is  
required, and ask if you can purchase short lengths of it.  The  
suppliers I've dealt with in Tucson are always willing to sell me  
short lengths of material.

Of course, if you're out in the backwoods somewhere this technique  
isn't so effective.

Good luck!

Zack
