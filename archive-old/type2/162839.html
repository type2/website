Subject: Re: [T2] gas theft

Zack insisted:

&gt;  you _can_ drive a vehicle
&gt;without a working fuel guage.

	Indeed, Typ-2 VW had no fuel gauge until  ...  when?   My '57 
certainly had none, and in the arithmetical agility of youth I never 
ran out of fuel.
	The many motorcycles I've ridden all lacked fuel gauges. 
Such instruments are a decadent luxury   ;-)
