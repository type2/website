&lt;&lt; Several questions start out like: ...and did a compression check on my
 30,000 mile engine and one was really low, or ...and I dont know why it runs
 so hot.  Now I have also noticed that a high percentage follow up these
 comments by adding:  It never had any problems til now...cruises all day
 long at 80 miles per hour...
     Well, I am not concluding a cause-effect here, but what a correlation!
 Anyone else notice this? I know some hop-ups would make 80 mph all day long
 possible. But I dont get it.  Who else likes those bumper stickers that say
 &quot;my other vw is even slower&quot;?

 Slow em down...OWN that right lane! Your bus will smile! &gt;&gt;

this is a good point......i wonder how many of you have taken the time to look
at ALL the places air can leak on your shrouding.  i put a new pressure plate
last weekend in a friends car.  nad when i was getting started to take the
engine out i could not believe all the little things that he had let slide.
air hoses had holes in them, one of them was not connected, cracked fuel hose,
engine seal in terrible shape ( what part of it was there ), etc. and when we
got the engine out i looked at the dog house cooler area.....to see if the
foam or rubber was there ( the part that goes around the oil cooler itself to
make sure no air blows AROUND it but rather THRU it)
....and of course it also was gone.  but he had cool looking dual 34 webers on
there and a freshly painted header system.  this kind of stuff makes me
scream!!!  but oh well you cant teach em` all...............

* i ended up fixing all the above problems...._dot_come on none of you could in
good faith walk away from that with out fixing it correctly could you????
