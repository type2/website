Subject: Re:Re: Taking a Federal car into CA

George Crawford wrote that the $300 fee for out-of-state vehicles brought 
into California was still operative. The fact is that that fee has been 
ruled out by the court. And if you paid such a fee in the past you have a 
right of getting it back (past 3 years) and a chance if you paid it earlier 
(depending on state legislation). For details on how to apply see
