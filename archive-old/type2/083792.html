&gt; &gt; Seems as though the best location for the sender is in the main oil
&gt; &gt; gallery or in the right rear quadrant of the sump where a dipstick sender
&gt; &gt; would live.  The sump plate does not seem to be such a good place for a
&gt; &gt; sender.
&gt;
&gt; I think the Gene Berg write-up covered all that.  I believe that where
you measure from isn't as critical as one, having an accurate
thermometer; two, determining what temperature indicates critical temp at
the point in the system where you are measuring; and three, ensuring that
your measurement point is valid in all conditions (turns, uphill,
downhill, RPM range, etc.).  Gene determined that the dipstick area
&gt; satisfied those requirements.

As long as you recognize that the maximum temperatures are above the
measured temperatures and adjust your &quot;maximums&quot; to compensate, then just
about any location will do.  The problem occurs when comparing one reading
to another.  A dipstick sender might read 25F higher than a sump sender so
you'd end up comparing apples to oranges.

&gt; If you are building an new engine one alternative is to drill and tap a
hole on the rear of the case opposite of where the hole is where a Type 3
engine dipstick would be.  A Berg Type 3 shorty thermometer can be
screwed in there so you don't have to fool with the tangled wire problem
that you have with the dipstick variety.

I still think that the best place is the main oil gallery.  That is the
oil that in circulation and will affect the bearings.  Circulating oil
will give more rapid readings than sump oil.
