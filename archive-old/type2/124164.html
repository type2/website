Subject: Sliding Door

Does anyone know of a sight that has good pictures of how to put the sliding
door hardware back together?
A broken roller forced me to take mine apart and since I was in there
already.......
I decided to take all the working gizmos out and give them a thorough cleaning
and lube.  Also took the opportunity to do soundproofing / insulation on the
inside of the door.
Now everything is clean and ready to go but a lightning strike to the pc
leaves me unable to get to all the pictures I took (bummer).  I have Bently
but you know how that goes.  So many parts!
Anyone in the Winston-Salem, NC area that's been down this road before want
free beer and a good way to spend the afternoon?  :-)
Also one of the rollers popped off but the two on the bottom seem fixed to
their hardware.  Anyone know if these are meant to be separated?  I don't want
to start prying if they're a pressed fit or something.
Anyway... thanks for the help.
