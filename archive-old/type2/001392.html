I see a new starter in your very near future. Yours sound like it's old and
sticky, a problem compounded by &quot;heat soak&quot; as we say in the trade. On
shutting down after a good run (50 miles is plenty) the heat from the
engine, having no motivation to go away any longer and being obedient to the
laws of thermodynamics and entropy - soaks into everything around it
including your starter.

You can check this by measuring the amperage the starter is using - check it
while cranking cold and then again when hot. My guess is you'll get a
reading noticeably higher when hot. Another possibility is voltage drop down
the length of the switch-to-solenoid wire. A quick test is to try jumpering
&gt;from the positive battery terminal on the solenoid to the switch wire
terminal when the starter is being recalcitrant (with the engine hot). If it
changes its tune and cranks the engine merrily, replace the wire. If it
still doesn't want to spin over, replace the starter. My money is on the
starter.

For grins, if you have more time than money or are cursed with obsessive
thrift  (or a lean pocketbook) you can try taking the starter and solenoid
apart and cleaning them thoroughly. Then install the solenoid plunger 180
degrees from its original position (turned around the long axis of the
plunger). We used to do this as a &quot;cheap&quot; fix for customers who were
strapped for cash... We don't do it anymore - the relatively low price of
rebuilt Bosch starters and the higher labor rate we have to charge makes
this kind of procedure no longer cost effective. Cheers!
