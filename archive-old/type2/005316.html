&gt;Unfortunately, Ansa discontinued the unit, and in the two years since then
&gt;I've been unable to find a comparable quality unit for anywhere even
&gt;remotely near the price.  The closest I could find was the Mexican made
&gt;Pacesetter system, for about the same price, which is similar but
definately
&gt;not as heavy-duty.


FWIW Ron is definitely right on this, the Ansa unit is much superior to the
Pacesetter and equally superior to the S&amp;S system.  All are identical in
shape and function but the ANSA is much heavier steel, in fact my last ANSA
came years ago from Whitless and is still on the Bus I put it on 8 years
back.  (Note that Whitless has not supplied the ANSA in years)
