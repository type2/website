Subject: smoking light switch

Hey gang,

On my way home today I hit a tunnel and turned on my lights, a coupple min. 
later I smelled and then saw some smoke comming out of the area surrounding 
the light switch.  Being daylight i just turned the lights of.  When home I 
took of the cover for the instrument pannel but couldn't see anything wrong. 
  Even tried leaving the lights on for a while and watching to try and find 
the smoke source, but it didn't rear it's ugly head.
Has anybody had this happen before, or know what it might be?

Any help would be great.  I was planning to head out and about this evening 
and lights would be nice.

Thanks
