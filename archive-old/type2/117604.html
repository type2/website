Subject: Re: [T2] A painting accident that turned out good...

John,

Sounds great!  So what effect is the reducer supposed to have on the paint 
and what &quot;bad&quot; will happen because you left it out!

One of the few things on cars I have not done.....paint...but it is
starting to sound more interesting!  I would risk it on my daily driver 
bug just to see what it looks like...

And what brand paint for only $75/gallon??

Cheers, dave

&gt; Last night I pulled off all the masking paper &amp; tape
&gt; and WOW!!  This was a good looking paint job, FAR
&gt; better than anything I have done in the past. Smooth,
&gt; even coverage, and absolutley NO RUNS!! It actually
&gt; looks like a semi-professional paint job!! Leaving out
&gt; the reducer made all the difference! it makes me want
&gt; to strip and re-paint my daily driver 71 westy using
&gt; this same method. 
&gt; Anyway, this is one of those accidental good-karma
&gt; things that sometimes happen, I have a great looking
&gt; paint job. Total cost: Primer $30, Sandpaper $5,
&gt; Automotive paint $75 gallon, new auction paint gun
&gt; $15, masking tape\paper $5, total = $130. 
&gt;
