&gt; Mike,
&gt; 
&gt; you can remove the fire wall to get access to the fuel tank. Note that on
&gt; my '75 there were an additional 2 screws to be accessed from underneath
&gt; the bus; they weren't mentioned in Bentley and I couldn't figure out why
&gt; the firewall wouldn't come out at first...
&gt; 
&gt; With the firewall removed, you can access the vent lines above the tank. 
&gt; At various locations those metal lines are connected to each other by 3
&gt; inch long rubber fuel hoses. You want to replace them all, including those
&gt; in the engine compartment (there's also one hidden behind the spare wheel
&gt; well).
&gt; 
&gt; While the firewall is off, check to see whether the large hose from the
&gt; filler neck to the tank is in good shape. For even better access to this
&gt; part, pry out the black round plate on the right of the engine compartment
&gt; and remove the ECU. With a full tank, rock the van and see if the large
&gt; hose is still dry.

&gt; Hey, wait, I had a trademark on that! ;) My Westy has the chartreuse paint
&gt; job, aka Yosemite Yellow, and my name is Sami, so Yosemite Sam is my CB
&gt; handle.

I had a similar problem with the fuel filler pipe. About 2&quot; in diameter and 3&quot; long (approx). VAG dealers quoted a rediculous price of 600SK (I'm in Sweden) thats about US$90 and I wasn't going to pay that for a piece of pipe!

So down to the car breakers I went and what luck. There was only one bus there, evidently the army buy all the vans and buses for target practise :O When I eventually managed to get the fire wall off to my suprise the pipe was a longer one with a bend in it and no sign of perishing. I had previously looked at other vans which had the same length of pipe as me but alas they were in the same state. My bus is a '77 so was this  bus a '78 and this was a modification?

Anyway I can get three lengths from this one pipe and got it for 20SK, about US$3, and that makes you feel real good!

Best
Ian
'77 Westy
