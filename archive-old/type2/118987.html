Subject: Re: [T2] Friday topic: Dashboard

From: &quot;Mark L. Hineline&quot; &lt;hineline_at_ocotillofield_dot_net&gt;
&gt; If you were going to update the dashboard in a bay, what would you add,
remove, revise?

I recently received a radio plate insert for both a bay and a Vanagon from a
listee.  I'm using both to create repros, and will produce a variant of the
bay plate to hold three 1.5&quot; gauges.  Still trying to figure out how to
modify the plate so that the gauges are angled toward the driver, but I
might produce two versions.  One with angled gauge openings and one with
straight &quot;normal&quot; gauge holes.

I'm not too sure about repro'ing the Vanagon plate.  The snap-fit tabs might
not be all that durable in resin.
