Subject: The joys of bus ownership&lt;f&gt;

Hey there Volks,

***  Warning !! No real technical questions ahead, but since it's
Friday, I figured I could get away with it 8-) Hit the Delete key
now, unless you want to hear me vent. Pmail me with any comments,
suggestions, or off the wall remarks.  ***

As the saying goes, &quot;The old grey mare, she ain't what she used to
be&quot;.

Checked the compression the other day on my bus, and the number three
cyl is down to 80psi. Well, I guess it's time for a rebuild. I did
the test cold, as I forgot that its surposed to be done with the
engine warm until after I had all 4 spark plugs out (oops). [1]

I've known that this motor needed rebuilding since I first got the
bus. I knew she used alot of oil, and that what leaked out of the
pushrod seals, didn't account for the amount of oil that I now have
to put in (don't ask - but I buy oil by the case now). The engine
still idles quite, still sounds good, and although power isn't what
it should be, she still runs strong up to 65. Cruising speed is
55-60, she'll use oil quicker if I drive faster. Still get around
17-18 mpg too. Smokes a little bit at startup, but it's not like
theres a big blue cloud behind the bus when its running down the
road.

I guess I was in denial. I just couldn't bring myself to admit to the
fact that my motor is slowly dying. The compression test showed me
the facts. I keep a logbook of oil and gas comsumption too, so I know
my quart of oil per miles ratio, etc. A rebuild is in my future.

I'm gonna run it all summer (about 5,000 miles for my &quot;weekend
warrior&quot;), and just keep putting oil in it. I'll take it easier on
the bus, no more driving it hard on the highway, take the rural
routes instead of the interstates when I can, just slow down. I'll
check the compression again in 3,000 miles too, just to keep an eye
on Mr. number three cylinder. Get it rebuilt this winter, when I
don't drive it much anyways. They salt the roads up here in New
England, and I bought this bus because it has a good body, hate to
have it rust away. 

See, I've known all along that the motor was weak, just couldn't
admit it. The bus is from out west, and I'd rather do engine work
rather than bodywork, I guess. The engine is the original, with
95,000 miles on it. Has the tell tale sign of oil spots on the rear
of the bus if I don't wash it often enough. Yep, she leaks and burns
oil.

I was gonna fix the pushrod seals, but I don't see much point in it
if I'm gonna rebuild it anyways. I'm not sure if I'll get an AVP
motor, have Boston Bob rebuild my original case, or just do a top end
rebuild myself (I'll do the P&amp;C's, and have Boston Bob or someone
clean up the heads). Probably have the original rebuilt. Should last
at least another 100,000.

Nah, my motor isn't dying, the other cylinders are 90, 100, and 120.
All of them (including #3) come up to 150-160 when I added some oil.
All the spark plugs look good too, brown/grey. So the rings are
tired, so what.  As long as number three doesn't get any worst, I'll
get another 10-20,000 miles out of it. (yeah, right) Somebody get me
another quart of oil !!

Thanks for listening, I feel much better now.....

[1] I have done this several times. Every once and awhile I get
lucky, and actually check the compression on a warm engine.
