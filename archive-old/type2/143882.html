Hello Guys This all depends on the type of plug you are using Some of the 
plugs use to come with a zinc coating on the threads that would bond with the 
heads. some are just steel. On these I would use the antisieze on the threads 
. Bosch and NGK I think have a nickel coating and dont bond as bad. I 
havent seen any reason NOT to use it on any plug and have never in my 25 years of 
professional shop working had a plug seize up due to antiseize later and have
