Subject: shift coupler

I received my new brake hoses from RMMW today along with
a new front shift rod bushing and a rear coupler. I am
looking for any advice before I tackle this. I also received
my new front brake hoses, I really hope that they will fix
my front brake not wanting to release problem. 

A quick word about RMMW. I like them. They have always
been courtious to me. I have always received my parts
with in about 4 days. I have delt with others including
MOFOCO, JCW, and WCM and I like RMMW best. HOwever,
many times there parts are higher priced for the 
same thing that others have. Just my 2 cents
