&gt;Sorry to bother a bunch of you who have no expertise with this, but I

&gt;tonight whether I could do her the favor of disconnecting the air bag on
&gt;her new Saturn.  She is quite concerned about some stories she has heard
&gt;about deaths caused by short people being too close as the air bag
&gt;inflates and being killed by the inflating bag.  I would like to help her,
&gt;but have no idea as to the wiring of theses things.  Do any of y'all have
&gt;any idea where to get a Saturn wiring diagram?  I hate the idea of working
&gt;on what I regard as a loaded gun without even a diagram.

Actually, I think you can just remove the whole airbag.  I know there have
been problems with people _stealing_ airbags...
