Check for local library for books by Harry Pellow. &quot;The ABC's of....Porsche
Engines&quot; or &quot;Secrets of the Inner Circle&quot;. He has very thorough procedures
and calculation formulas which are the same for the VW air cooled engine.
Just plug in your measures for pistons and chambers. Also, Berg's sells a
disc with their own software for this and other VW engine calculations.
They also sell all the tools needed to set up heads and motors and any
shims you might need.
