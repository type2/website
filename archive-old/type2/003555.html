&gt; &gt;When I asked Boston Bob what kind of oil pressure he
&gt; &gt;would guarantee on a T4 rebuild, he sounded like a
&gt; &gt;politician.  Near as I could tell he couln't guarantee
&gt; &gt;anything.  How did Boston Bob get such a good rep?
&gt;
&gt; A whole bunch of people, some with good skill and knowledge, have
testified
&gt; on this forum and others to a quality product from good procedures. The
&gt; valve adjustment procedures for the Wasserboxers are being updated by
&gt; VW/Bentley based upon his research and testing. Are you aware how rare it
&gt; is for any major automotive manufacturer to revise a basic procedure of
&gt; nearly 20 years standing?? And a German manufacturer at that. They would
&gt; not have considered doing so unless he presented his data and information
&gt; in a PROFESSIONAL manor in the lingo of Neandereers (Engineers descendand
&gt; from Apes with BigBonedBrowRidges).
&gt;
&gt; Boston Bob is recognized as expert in motor building because he gets good
&gt; results, day in and day out. He is one of a handful of VW builders that
can
&gt; be trusted to give spec or better products reducing the chance of failure
&gt; to the lowest possible probability.
&gt;
&gt; In my opinion, you can be reassured that the oil pressure your engine
comes
&gt; with will meet or beat VW specifications if Boston Bob or NW ConRod build
&gt; it. Read the warrenty to see what is covered.
&gt;
&gt; If, however, you think you have need of a higher than spec oil pressure
&gt; guarantee then I suggest you check with Bergs. They do custom VW motor
&gt; design of the highest level and have more inhouse research than anyone
&gt; except the factory.
