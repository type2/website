Subject: BusDepot Website Navigation / Finding Parts

&gt;&gt; Busdepot's website still confounds me.  Does everyone know
&gt;&gt; to click on  the &quot;See all Parts&quot; button? I was blowing it on that
&gt;&gt; for sometime,  also, you have to use the back button all the time,
&gt;&gt; I don't like the navigation.

&gt; BD's site has worked well for me. You can't expect someone
&gt; that isn't an amazon_dot_com to have the most pimped out site
&gt; with excellent interface design.  It costs a lot of money in
&gt; programmers, research, and time to have a site that really
&gt; flows.  That might not be BD, but at least he's got the parts
&gt; out there on the internet available for everyone to browse
&gt; through.


The site was admittedly designed on a tight budget.  If only I had just one
percent of what Amazon spends on their site design!  Heck, if I had one
percent of what Amazon spends on their website, I could simply retire! :-)
Whereas most VW parts sites have maybe 5,000 to 10,000 parts, BusDepot_dot_com's
database contains about 190,000 parts. Making such a huge catalog easy to
navigate has not proven easy, especially with a limited graphics design
budget. (Okay, almost no graphics design budget. I did most of it myself,
and I'm no pro.)  Still, it's a work in progress, and I would really
appreciate any feedback on design, navigation, content, errors, etc.. Every
little bit of feedback helps a lot. While we will never have the deep
pockets of Amazon_dot_com unless I win the lottery, it doesn't mean we can't
make improvements.

Unfortunately I think that site's the graphic design does not sufficiently
highlight some of the site's most useful features.  In particular...

1) The &quot;View all of the above parts&quot; button on each page (which makes the
page display every part in all of the categories shown above the button), as
Billy mentioned

2) The context-sensitive &quot;search all of the above parts&quot; box, also located
on each page. This search becomes more specific as you drill down. For
example, if you choose &quot;72-79 bus&quot; in the main drop-down menu, then the
search box on the resulting (white) page searches only within 72-79 Bus
parts. If you go one step further after choosing &quot;72-79 Bus&quot; and choose
&quot;Brakes&quot; on the next page, now the same search box limits its results only
to Brake parts within those years. If you drill down one step further and
click on &quot;Front Brakes,&quot; now the same search box only searches Front Brake
parts within those years. And so on. (By comparison, the search box in the
left yellow menu bar always searches the entire database at once.)

3) The green &quot;i&quot; icons next to some part categories, which take you to
various Info pages (pictures, diagrams, etc.)

Our Help page does have navigation tips at
&lt;http://busdepot_dot_com/help.jsp#FINDPARTS&gt; and search tips at
&lt;http://busdepot_dot_com/help.jsp#SEARCH&gt; . If you read them you'll get a lot
more out of the site, but of course most people don't.

As for navigating backwards, from most pages you can click on the words in
&quot;drilldown&quot; listed at the very top of each page.  (For example, if you are
at  72-79 Bus &gt; Brakes &gt; Front Brakes ... each of these words is actually a
link that takes you back to that particular level of the drilldown.)  But if
you click on a specific part and go to its &quot;details&quot; page, you do have to
use your browser's &quot;back&quot; button to get back into the drilldown again. I am
aware of this idiosyncracy and hope to fix it relatively soon.

I'm quite curious as to how many people have been using the site but never
knew about some of features I've mentioned here. My suspicion is that the
navigation is not as well explained (or perhaps as intuitive) as it should
be.  (Of course it's intuitive to me;  I designed it, so I know exactly how
it works. :-)
