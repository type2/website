Subject: A big (long awaited) thanks!

Hi all

sorry for the delay in getting back to you all, but I've been on holiday
and alas on my return my PC decided it didn't want to know me any more.

So, I would just like to say thanks to all those who helped in my quest
to get my '78 westy back on the road (a little engine trouble!).
Unfortunately my hard drive went down and I do not have any of the old
emails (backup... was'at?), so I can't thank people individually.

However a special thanks to Glen Swanson and David Schwarze who kindly
sent me parts via the post. I &quot;will&quot; get back to you I promise :) (I
have your postal addresses).

Many thanks again and congrats on a great list

Ian
