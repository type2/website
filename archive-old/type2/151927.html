&gt; Hello,   I am heading Sout, down I-95 from Springfield Virginia to spend a
&gt; few weeks by myself in Florida.

have a nice trip
&gt;
&gt; I have the Florida AIRS list, but  I will not have a cell phone on my trip.

why not run by 7-11 or someplace similar and buy one of those limited use
prepaid cell phones... when you run out of minutes you throw it away.

&gt; I am planning to leave Friday midnight (less traffic) and go South until I
&gt; get somewhere interesting.
&gt;
&gt; I will be driving a ''78 Sage Green westy that has seen better days and
&gt; times, with a Virginia license plate    6PAC 2GO   .

that Westy is in great shape,

have a great trip, wish I was going with you.

have you thought of tagging along on the Herbie bus tour, it leaves
northern VA Sunday.
