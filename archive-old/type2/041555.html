Hello there ,

I,m new to the list having just bought a '72 Danbury conversion, in which we 
are off to France in three weeks.

Has anyone heard of a mod. to the engine where an extra spark plug is added 
to each cylinder? I remember reading about this &quot;twin plugging&quot; of 
motorcycle engines especially big twins such as BMW's and Moto Guzzi's years 
ago. The benefits are supposedly increased efficiency in burning the gases 
with improved power coupled with increased M.P.G.

Any thoughts?

Regards  Alister.
