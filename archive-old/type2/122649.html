Subject: Advice on researching ownership history of a Bus

Hey folks...

I've become curious lately about the ownership history of my Bus (no 
reason other than just pure curiosity).  I intend to keep my Bus for a 
very long time, and I am just really interested in knowing how many POs 
have come before me.

My first thought was to check Carfax, but they can only do cars 1981 or 
later.

I'm pretty sure that this Bus has always been a California Bus (it has 
the California emissions package, and has a California Dept. of Housing 
and Community Development RV sticker on it).

Is my best bet going to be to call the DMV, give them the VIN, and ask 
for the title history?

Thanks!
