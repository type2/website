Subject: Using a BA6 with the engine off - how much fuel and battery do they use

I have an Ebersp=E4cher BA6 already installed and running well =

in my van. However, I am thinking about an auxillary heater =

that I can use while winter camping &quot;off grid&quot;.

Am I crazy for buying=
 another heater? I know I can use the =

BA6 without running the engine to pre-heat the van, but what =

about running it all night? How much fuel does it use? What =

would the draw be on my battery?

Thanks,
Chris
