Subject: Re: [T2] Bricks, Vandels, and a Clutch...

Easy fix. Don't worry. Any body shop can fix it. A bit of welding, bit of metal pulling, some filler and paint. Once repaired, try to get behind the welding and ut some paint when the OEM gets burned off. 

I know how you feel. My then 2 week old '99 CR-V (1st new car) got keyed. 

I'm glad I didn't catch the kid - would have probably broken his arm or something - and I'm not a violent person...

Minimum he would have gone to the police station in an arm/head lock and Mommy and Daddy would have paid for the repair in cash on the spot...
