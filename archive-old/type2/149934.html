Subject: Re: [T2] Emily - reintroduction

Thanks all.  Well, of course you know this is what I wanted to hear.  I'm
glad to be back and will make it a priority to do something good to
Hildegarde before the snow flies.  My husband got a tractor recently so
we've been thinking about trying to get the bus out to the acreage where the
tractor lives and buying one of those canopies for them to share.  We go out
to visit the tractor and our daughter loves to play on it, and I think it's
about time she got to enjoy playing around in a bus, too!

My parents bought this bus in 1981, when I was four.  Before that we had a
'72 bus.  They got this one when we moved to Florida because it had air
conditioning!  This is the bus I grew up in.  My mom got a Passat wagon in
'89 I think and my older sisters drove the bus until I got it in '94.  Man,
I'm getting old.  LOL  Anyway, yes, I need to keep her and pass her on.  I
was just feeling like someone else could love her more.  But I know that's
not possible.
