Subject: Re: [T2] Is there an alternative to a BN4?

When Adrian and I threw the engine back in my bus we left the heat ducts
off completely. I have no 'built-in' heat in the bus (other than the warmth
from the engine rising through the back seat). I drove the bus the other
night from Atlanta to Chattanooga in 30 degree weather - about three hours
at bus speeds. The PowerCat did a great job of keeping me warm. Do make
sure you use the fan or the heat just goes straight up. I've used the
PowerCat camping too. It works great. I also use it in the house to heat
the bring the temp up in the room while I do yoga. It doesn't put out
enough heat to warm a large room. I've tried it in a 13x15 room but could
only raise the temp a few degrees.

I am going to invest in a CO detector though because I want to make sure I
wake up every morning when I camp - but the same concern is valid for any
combustible heat source (like the BN4). I'm also a little concerned about
my daughter sleeping in the back on long drives. I'm scared of developing
an exhaust leaks and my not noticing because I'm in the well-venthilated
front of the bus while she snoozes in the back.

&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; The idea of a supplemental heat source, particularly one that can be
&gt;&gt; &gt; used while in camp, is extremely attractive to me. Is there another
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I bought a Coleman PowerCat for $65. It uses those 16oz propane
&gt;&gt; canisters and has a DC fan. It puts out about 3000btu/hr for 8 hours
&gt;&gt; on one $1.80
&gt; can
&gt;&gt; of propane. The fan uses two D size batteries or can be plugged into
&gt;&gt; an adapter and run off the 12v DC in the bus.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; What is most impressive about the PowerCat is the base is large enough
&gt;&gt; to use while driving. I've never had it tip over. It also fits nicely
&gt;&gt; between the front seats in my '74 Campmobile.
