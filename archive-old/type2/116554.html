Subject: RE: [T2] 1600 CC retrofit Gearing 

Is the 76 and later trans different because I hear form lots of folks who
say don't do this the gears will be a real prob
I personally don't cruise to quickly and don't live in an overly warm
climate so I won't over tax the eng that way but I want to make sure I can
get up the normal hills you encounter in  everyday driving.
any ideas on how to deal with the vac brake booster - where to tap in

This probably won't be a problem, because the 75 trans is only geared taller
in the first three gears.  Fourth gear is almost identical to the 69
transaxle.  The only problem might be that it will be a little harder to
start off on a hill, for example, but unless you live in San Francisco and
carry 1,000lbs of sand in your bus every day, you probably won't notice the
difference.
