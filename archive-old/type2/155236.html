&gt; What keeps 'em from swiveling around as you're trying to &quot;snap&quot; 'em in?

Just for fun, I pulled my instrument cluster out and put it back in
tonight.  Heck, I even joined thesamba just so I could post some
pictures of the clips and the cluster.  The way the clips are shaped
and the way they fit on the instrument cluster prevents them from
rotating, at least on my bus.  Maybe there was a change made somewhere
along the line.  As Jack points out, the Haynes manual mentions
rotating them when removing the cluster so they don't fall behind the
dash.  On my bus, there is no way to rotate the clips.  When you
remove the cluster, you have to fish the clips out, but installation
is easy.
