&gt; Just bought a '68 camper and need to have it towed home (approx 45 mi one

&gt;
&gt; The question I have is whether to tow with the back wheels up (recommended
&gt; for beetles) or do the front wheels up?

I will ONLY tow mine with all four wheels on something, either a trailer
or rollback..
  if you _must_ tow it on it's wheels, take off the half shafts and mark
em left/right  wheel/tranny side.  and tow with rear wheels on the ground.
but first check
. wheels on tight
. brakes are free
. air presure in the tires full and even
. hook up some lights on the rear
. put &quot;BUS IN TOW&quot; sign in rear window

not over 45max

Bob
rent a U-haul trailer for peace of mind, or hire a rollback tow truck

All good advice..just towed one 600 miles on it's wheels..shafts out etc.

In this short distance case...you got AAA? Last year we bought a DC 50 miles
away..and our AAA plus towed it to the door. Didn't feel quolty about using
them..as I have paid them annual fees for decades..and had NEVER used them.
