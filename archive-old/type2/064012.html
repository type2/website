&gt;&gt; &gt;Did anyone ever respond to Pat's question about BTU's on these heaters?
&gt;&gt; Yes.  This information is courtesy of Ron Van Ness:

&gt;&gt;      Early model 12v BN4 (71-earlier bus):
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;      Heat variable from 1080-4000 kcal/hour

Harry,

Thanks for the conversion factors but the kcal/hr still doesn't &quot;feel&quot;
right.  If we multiply 4000x0.397 we get 1588 BTUs (or is it BTU/hr?) which
seems AWFULLY low for the max. output of a heater.  Oh well, one of the
mysteries of life.  :-)
