Subject: [T2] Guess what I got to drive

Hi everyone, I thought that since it is Friday, I'd tell you that I got to
drive that Mexican Bus we have at work.  It's an 88 model Kombie, white of
course, with a lovely blue cloth interior.  It is a 4 cylinder inline
watercooled engine with a 4 speed.  And it has air conditioning.

It pretty much drives the same as my 76, but it's a little slower.  Probably
because the mechanics who work on it don't know anything about Mexican VWs.
The transmission needs syncros.

This bus was the crew van in Mexico City for Delta Air Lines, and a couple
years ago was shipped up here to Atlanta to be scrapped out.  A division of
ACS happened to need a vehicle at the time, so it still rides around on the
airport up here.  I've been trying to talk them out of it for a very long
time, but to no avail.

So that was the highlight of my evening.  I hope I get to drive it again
sometime.

Mike
76 Bus
