Subject: fuel pump woes: '66

Hi Volks,

I'm the lucky owner of an ongoing starting problem.

The starting problem manifests itself as an (apparently) flooded
engine.  I no longer think it is the carb's problem, and working
backwards I'm at the fuel pump.  

Looking at a manual, (the orange one) it has a pretty good 
description of the fuel pump, but footnotes the fact that engines
with alternators have the fuel pump body angled at 15degrees and 
that the actuator shaft is 100mm instead of 108mm.  

What they don't say, is how far the shaft is supposed to stick up past 
the intermediate base at its highest point.  They say 13mm for a
normal/generator fuel pump, but give no number for the alternator style
fuel pump.

Should it be:

a) 13mm
b)  5mm
c) none of the above

Now, picking 'c' whenever uncertain got me thru a bunch of electives at school,
but probably won't help me in this situation.

Any help would, as always, be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
...Markus
