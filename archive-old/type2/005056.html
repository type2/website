Popular subject on this list, so I might as well chime in.

'71 Westy with 1600DP dual relief case and stock everything, and about 50K
miles on the engine.  The carb is a Brazilian 34 PICT, new about 20K miles
ago.  Throughout the life of this engine, oil pressure has always been
excellent (no OP light at idle ever).  Just before my last road trip, I
installed a Berg dipstick sender, and during the trip I was getting a
flickering light basically any time I tried to push it past about 55 - 60
mph. Outside air temperature was in the 50s to 70s. Otherwise, the bus ran
fine with no problems.

One thing I found was that the spark plug air seals were kinda tired looking
and not sealing.  I also have heard an intermittent whistling kind of sound,
seems to happen when the engine is cold and the choke is on (suspect vacuum
leak?)

Over the weekend, I tried to check the thermostat adjustment, but I found
that there was no thermostat and no connecting link rod.  So now I wonder if
a) the flaps are in place and b) if present, are they open?  Is there any
way to check these things without pulling a whole lot 'o stuff apart?

I also replaced the spark plug air seals.

To check for vacuum leaks, I did the carb cleaner spray thing in all the
usual places (manifold boots, vacuum advance lines, brake booster line, base
of carb) and no change in idle speed from that. I didn't hear the whistling
sound at all this weekend. Any other things I should do to check for vacuum
leaks?

I have not had a chance to do a test drive, so no report on the results of
replacing the air seals.

I know this question has been asked before, but I'll try again to see if
there is any consensus.  Just how hot is too hot?  The Berg sender is
supposed to go off at 225 to 227 degrees F (just how accurate that thing is
is a matter suspicion to me).

tia.
