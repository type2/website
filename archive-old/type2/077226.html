&gt;the ECU is different but close enough that the average person wouldn't
&gt;know the difference.

Abnormal inquiring minds would like to know what the differences are.

&gt;&gt; The big question is : Could I use my ECU from my automatic bus to run a
&gt;&gt; manual transmission?
&gt;
&gt;yes, BUT!

That's a big BUT, Bob !  There are 4 brains listed for the 79, ( 2 are California ),
and there are indeed separate boxes for Manual and Automatic. It may be fuel-map
related if the engine torque curves are different. Otherwise, they use essentially the
same fuel injection components, with a slight difference in idle speed. Probably works.
