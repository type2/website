Subject: Blown'n fuses

Greetings,

Again 78 with 79 2.0 Liter and mostly '79 electrical

I got the turn signals working. Turns out I had two wires crossed, the ones 
in the rectangle connector by the headlight bucket. Grey goes to grey not 
black, go figure.

I also got the rear sidemarker light working. Loose bulb in crappy 
overpriced repo housing. But good now.

But now I am having issues with #11 fuse/ circut. This is the fuse that 
controls the horn, brake warning light, and brake lights. It is supposed to 
be a 8 amp fuse (white). Every time I step on the brakes the fuse blows. I 
even tried a 16 amp (red) and it blew. Then I had a blue fuse which I don't 
even know what amp and it did not blow but the brake lights still didn't 
work. All that happened is that the brake warning light on the dash dimmed.  
I am stummped again. I checked the wiring diagram and my digital photos of 
the fuse box before the swap and all checks out.

What would cause this? My taillight housings are of the repo flavor, not 
Hela. It just dawned on me that there are two connectors, one for the tail 
light and one for the brake light. Seems like if these were mixed up it 
would only light the other filament in the bulb. Though I am no electrical 
wiz, ovbiously.

Now on to why my gas gauge skyrockets way past full when I turn the key when 
I know there is only 2 gal of gas in the tank.

Many thanks,
Brandt
