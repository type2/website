&gt;Have you ever tried the local NAPA. I usually find great ones there. They

&gt;hand. They cost a little more up front but, compared to buying two boxes of 
&gt;regular nitrile gloves. I have been using them for about three years and 
&gt;have seen the price drop on them from $20 a box to about $14. They are sized 
&gt;and fit very well.

I've found gloves at NAPA, OSH and elsewhere but I don't like the powdered variety which are far more common.
