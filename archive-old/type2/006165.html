Sean, as I've often posted, I love my single Webers...but then we always are
where it isn't cold. By coincidence had to 80 mile round-trip it to
Asheville today to get some boots for the carb on our cheap, beater camper.
Young fellow at flaps had 78 camper, loved our new 71 SC..who wouldn't?, so
we got to talking. Thinking of this recent thread, I asked him about the
icing problem in NC in the winter. (Yes..it gets VERY cold here). He says
after rejetting his Weber, he's never had a single icing incidence..and this
over several years. Whatchathink?

Regards, Marv..who don' need no stinkin' cold.
