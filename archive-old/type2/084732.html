&gt;Now, on my bus, I would not run the K&amp;N.  I don't need the anti-clog

FWIW my experience on the Mustang was good.  I put a K&amp;N filter on the car 
about 5-6 years ago and drove another 100k miles in that time (total of 
210k miles).  Still runs low 13's at 105mph, idles smooth and gets 25mpg on 
the highway.  If I could find a K&amp;N to fit my bus I would use it in a 
heartbeat.  It's true that the K&amp;N filter element is coarse compared to a 
stock paper filter, but it is also oiled.  Different filtering technology 
so direct comparisons of the media are irrelevent.  One last thing to 
consider - buying one K&amp;N and using it for the life of your vehicle keeps a 
lot of dirty paper filters out of the landfills.  Bottom line though - if 
you're serious about your choice of air filter, read all of the information 
available and make up your own mind, and then try not to let it become a 
religious matter.  To each their own.  :-)
