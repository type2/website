Subject: RE: [T2] RE: AC Delco Alternator

AHHH!!! No.... ok, this is how my brain works sometimes. Sometimes when
explaining things, I'll skip steps or assume someone knows what I'm talking
about. And before you bust out with the jokes, I am a programmer, not a
technical writer. 

Anyway. My idea (and I assumed this is what the other guy wanted as well)
was to completely get rid of the original alternator to being with.
Fabricate (by bending, etc) the tinwork so that it can work (and complete a
good seal of air flow) without the alternator in there. 

THEN, fabricate some sort of a bracket that will allow you to bolt the
alternator somewhere else on the engine, probably at a 45 degree angle
looking at the motor horizontally from the rear. 

It's pretty easy to create your own brackets. Lincoln Electric sells a
REALLY nice welder for VERY cheap. You don't need gas, or anything. Comes
with everything you'll need. You can spot-weld, or weld together complete
sheets of 1/8th inch thick steel. 

Either that, or you could snag a bosch A/C compressor bracket from some
other Bus, stick an alternator on there (one way or another). It doesn't
necessarily have to be AC Delco, it could be a ford, or a chysler, what have
you.


One of the things I WAS trying to say is that... there are MANY MANY harsher
conditions that many Delco alternators go through than what a Bosch
alternator in a VW Bus might go through.

I must have missed the post where you described that - and I was reading
pretty closely.  

So rather than replacing the stock alternator, now you're talking about
adding an *additional* alternator inside the engine compartment?  That has a
whole 'nuther set of complications - primarily, how to drive it.  But I
still think it is unnecessary for 99.9% of bus owners.
