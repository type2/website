Subject: Re: [T2] GO ! ! ! (please)

i feel your pain, brother. i am used to driving a beetle, and that this
was slipperier than snot on a doorknob, compared to this bus (my first
bus, a 70 westy, only been driving it for about a month now). i
strategicly plot a course to get on certain highway on ramps here in town
because they are either really long, or go downhill... or i brace myself
to drive on the shoulder for a while til i get up to speed... ok, so that
isnt always the truth... people 'round here drive crazy sometimes and we
have a couple of on ramps on the LEFT side of the highway, so getting OUT
of the left lane when the people flying past in the next lane or 2 are
going mach 3, isnt always easy... or sane... especially with a HUGE
cabinet blocking my view (yes, i know that is what the mirror is for on
the right, but i am still used to being able to see out all my windows).
anyway, i know what you mean... i have hereditary leadfoot. especially
when there is a slow person in front of me... like when i am trying to
USE the entrance ramp to gain speed and the *^%$^%*&amp;^ in front of me
waits til the END of the ramp to figure out where their accelerator pedal
is... i get so frustrated that i end up pushing my bus way harder than i
should, trying to get around them.
