Subject: chains

We get so little snow and ice here that I can't justify a $500 set of  snow tires.  I remember my Dad, God rest his soul, using a set of  chains the few days a year that we get snow. I'm considering buying a  set.  Does anyone have experience with them?  Do they tear up  the tires?  The longest I can remember needing chains was an ice  storm that lasted a week or ten days.  Well, then there was the  blizzard of '93 but that probably won't happen again in my  lifetime.  If I get a bunch of negative responses I may try to  find a good used set of snow tires.  But it may be difficult to  find them for a bus down here in the sunny south.  I am concerned  because even with my beloved Hancooks the bus doesn't seem to have as  much grip as the other vehicles I've driven in the past.  But  maybe I'm just paranoid because of the bad aerodynamics.  Or  absence thereof.  Cheers...KR
