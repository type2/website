Subject: RE: [T2] raising (ground clearance) a 71 type II

Mike,

The September issue of HotVWs has an article about a feller in Cali that did
this to his 69 Westy. Honestly it looks really well done and not over the
top ridiculous. You should drop him a line and ask him how he got around the
challenges. Sandrail guys do it all the time, so it is definitely possible.
You would probably need a higher offset CV joint and a couple other simple
mods.

Or, you could throw it on a Chevy truck frame like all the weirdos do around
here. I just saw a 04 Celica on a 4x4 frame for sale yesterday. I almost
wrecked gaping at it.
