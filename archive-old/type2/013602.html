Subject: Fuel Line Length: Try #2

Hey All -
[Note: I posted this inquiry a week ago with no luck, so I thought give it
another go.]  Say, can anyone tell me what approximate length of fuel line
is needed to do a total line replacement on a 79 bus?  I currently have
about 20 feet of HP fuel line on hand, but need to use about 6 inches for
something else and don't want to come up short.  I've seen various posts
where the claimed amount of line required ranges from 10 feet to 25 feet. 
Thanks for your
help!
