Re West's suggestion of a sock to seal tygon tubing to your vac line to
clean out oil galleys...
A sock to seal your vac?  Great way to suck up the sock and dirty it..(-;
..I use a hunk of duct tape; the tube is also great for cleaning inside
your  computer also.  BTW, the over 200K milage 78 engine (no rebuild) made
it to Everybus (1,000 total miles)...sailing along at 75 mph (and still the
slowest thing on the road!!!)
