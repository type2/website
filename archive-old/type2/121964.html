OK, that's what it looks like...Sears has 'em but mine's Portalign...
This, and a reverse threaded drill, &quot;should&quot; be able to drill out the
stud...&quot;Usually&quot; the bit catches the stud and if you're lucky, the
stud unscrews. Without the stability afforded by the brace, most
times the bit catches off center and tends to snap...Use the smal-
lest bit you can get to start and increase size once you've got a pilot
hole. The less bit projecting from the chuck is also helpful to avoid
any wobble...
