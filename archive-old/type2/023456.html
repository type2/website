Subject: Stuck Brake Adjusters-What Worked
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

First, thanks to all who replied to my post about the stuck adjusters, you 
folks are the best! Several folks suggested getting a 10 X 50 MM bolt, 
removing the slotted bolt that holds the brake shoe, put in the longer bolt 
and crank away 'til it bottoms out then keep cranking and it forces the 
adjuster out. This is what I did and it worked beautifully. They were quite 
rusty so I cleaned them up with some emory cloth, put on a dab of anti-seize, 
and reinstalled them. I still think I've got a vacuum leak to the booster, 
though, and have new rubber grommets to replace the old ones where the line 
changes from metal to the hard plastic. The old grommets were dried out and 
cracked, and one was even smashed inside the tube, and I believe this was the 
one that was leaking.    Thanks again,   Jeff S.
