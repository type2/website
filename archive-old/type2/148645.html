Subject: Friday kind of post

No one should take this personally. What I'm going to say is not 
personal, at least not in the &quot;Godfather&quot; personal kind of way. I'm not 
looking to put a horse's head on anyone's satin sheets.

When I ask a question, I'm looking for an answer from experience. If I 
ask how to do a task, or ask a question about the best source of parts 
or supplies -- in fact, if I ask any question at all -- I'm looking for 
experience. I know how to (a) search the archives, (b) search using 
google, (c) go to the library, (d) search on amazon_dot_com, etc. I never - 
well, I try never to -- bother the list with questions that I can look 
up. (Sometimes I experience a acute cerebral flatulence, and ask about 
something I should know I can look up, but I do try not to).

But that's where experience comes in. There's shelves and acres and 
tons and cubic kilometers of drek out there. Parts that are garbage, 
books (like the Haynes manual for buses) that aren't worth buying, 
tools that are too little or too much to do the job.

It seems to me that this is where the list shines: people who have 
experience sharing what they know with people who aren't sure.

Most people on this list want to help, and what I'm saying is probably 
a little -- maybe a lot -- rude. But I think it's a good guideline to 
keep in mind.

Rant over, flame suit on, 10-4.

Mark
