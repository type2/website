&gt; Ok I figured out where to hook up all the wires except one.  My new unit wants

It probably either powers its internal lighting from the dash lighting
circuit (allowing you to dim the radio's internal lighing at the same time
you dim the dash lights)  OR  It has a fixed dimming of the lights when
the headlights come on.

Try the radio without the wire in question hooked up.  If the internal
lighting comes on you don't need to hook up the wire unless you want
dimming.  If the internal lighting does not come on then you will need to
hook up the wire to the bulb side of the instrument panel dimmer circuit.
