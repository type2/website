Ok, so this time I'll put a subject on.  I'm tired, dirty, and sunburned,
gimme a break!;p

April 11, 99- As of this weekend, the old backbone has finally been shut
down. Unfortunatly, half of the world has STILL not updated their DNS
cache for some stupid reason I can't figure out. So some of you are
sending email, and trying to connect to, the old servers, which no longer
exist.  All of the old names (www.type2_dot_com, type2_dot_com, irc.type2_dot_com,
mail.type2_dot_com, etc, SHOULD point to 208.178.20.188, but some of you are
not (me included, my new ISP is having the same problem), so you cnant
connect, or send mail.

  *sigh* 

The quick cure is going to be for you to send you email to 
type2_at_quantum.digital-galaxy_dot_net or vintagebus, or whatever, instead of 
_at_type2_dot_com....  IRC users do the same, use quantum.digital-galaxy_dot_net, 
instead of irc.type2_dot_com.   I am still working at getting this to work
right, and this will only be short term.  The majority of you are still
recieving email, and should continue too.  A few are not, and I am
sorry, it is due to your ISP's mail server configuration.  Once this
starts working again, you should start recieving mail.

  thanks for you patience....david (just got home..)
