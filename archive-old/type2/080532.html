&gt; &gt; Water injection is used to curb detonation in high-compression race
&gt; engines.
&gt;
&gt; I have been wondering what happened  ese tins.  When I was in my high
&gt; hormone years, say 20 years ago, you couldn't open a hot rod mag without
&gt; seeing half a dozen ads for water injection.  Now they're passe.  I wondered
&gt; if it was due to the availability of efi and computerized ignition.
&gt;
&gt; Always seemed kind of odd to me that one would try to increase the
&gt; volumetric efficiency with a supercharger, only to have to take up half the
&gt; volume with water vapor, but I'm sure the numbers crunch out differently.

Well, all you want is to expand something, and water expands very well if
you have the energy to convert liquid to vapor.  The energy needed will
come from the burning fuel, cooling the combustion and preventing
preignition.

This works fine as long as you don't care how much energy you use, which
is true in race conditions.
