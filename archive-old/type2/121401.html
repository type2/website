&gt;This problem you speak of -- is it particular to older T4 engines?  The 
&gt;fan on my '78 engine is held on by 3 bolts with 1/2&quot; (12.7mm) heads, and 
&gt;is not held on by one big nut.  Since more than one of you has mentioned 
&gt;the fan falling off, should I worry that mine might someday as well?

The three you're seeing are the ones that hold the fan to the hub.  The
&quot;big one&quot; the original poster had a problem with is the one that holds
the hub to the crank.
