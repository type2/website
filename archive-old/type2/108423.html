Subject: Bumper Caps

From: &quot;Richard Atwell&quot; &lt;ratwell_at_mac_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Or some bumper caps!

I poured the first half of the mold last night. :O)

I'm low on RTV, but when I pour the second half, I'll have a mold of your
original caps.  I'll use castings (pulls) from that mold to make a number of
cleaned-up masters for another mold that will be used for production runs.

As soon as I get the first mold finished, I'll send your originals back to
you; then when the second mold is ready, I'll send you some &quot;new&quot; bumper
caps cast from it.

Thanks for the loan of the original caps.

I'm still waiting on the following, if the folks who offered loaners are
still interested:

- Fuse Cover
- Westy Clip
- Radio Plate

I've also got a cool idea for a 3-gauge bracket, but it's going to take some
engineering to get it just right.  The usual gauges are 2 1/16&quot; in diameter,
right?  Anyone remember how deep they go into the hole?

And now I'm looking at a project making fascia and clear buttons for
Empeg/Rio automobile MP3 players... life's interesting. :O)
