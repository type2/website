Subject: Re: [T2] crankshaft pulley nut

You never know. I once took my bus to a shop to have some tires put 
on. I made the mistake of leaving my spare fan belt on the passenger 
seat. The mechanic saw it, took a look at the one on the motor and 
decided it was time for a change. Somehow he stripped the gen. shaft. 
When I arrived at the shop he was busy putting new threads on the 
shaft. When all was said and done I had a shiny new 17mm nut holding 
the pulley on.  Whatever....

As for Muir, keep your salt shaker handy.
