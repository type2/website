Subject: Fuel ventillation system/charcoal canister question.

Hello. When I was a young stupid freshman, I tore all of the fuel vent/charcoal canister tubing out of the engine compartment from the top vents of the gastank in my 1973 bus. This is a carburated engine, so I figured that it wouldn't matter. The bus hasn't had an engine in it since then, but the time may be near. After consulting some people, I decided that I needed that system, so this is what I did: I ran a fuel line from each of the two vent tubes in the top of the gas tank. These fuel lines come together in a T fitting and run to a spare piece of the original I found, through the wall, along the original path and to a remaining piece of original tubing which runs up the left vent wing and back down. At this point, the path ends. Was there a reason VW ran the system through both vent wings? Do I still need to run this vent through the charcoal canister or can I cut it off near the top of the vent wing? What ill effects could this replacement system promote? Where do I go from
 here? Thank you.                                                     -Paul Deatherage
