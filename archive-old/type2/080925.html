Subject: Re: [T2] New shocks need for 74 westy, any suggestions

Bus Depot lists Boges at $24.95 each, front and rear. That's where I bought
mine.

They do ride well.

Cheers

&gt; &gt;DT,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;If you price out Boges, would you get me a price for my '78 Westy?
&gt; &gt;I have Gas Adjusts on the rear and GR2s on the front which has worked
&gt; &gt;well so far  (10k) a little stiffer than stock, especially on the rear...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks,

&gt;
&gt; Boges for 70 through 79 T-II's are $50 each front or rear plus shipping.
If
&gt; someone else wants to take orders and place one order with me for 10 sets,
&gt; I would ship them all to the hero, and give them a 15% discount for their
&gt; trouble. Personal checks will take 2 weeks to clear before shipping. Money
&gt; order or cashier's check will ship immediately. If you want some, say so
&gt; and give me your zip. I will ship either UPS or USPS, your choice. I'll
&gt; gestimate the shipping and get back to you with the bottom line on a pair
&gt; or set of 4. If you are in WA state, add 7.7% sales tax.
&gt;
&gt; I would expect they are available elsewhere here and abouts. My supplier
&gt; has warehouses in a dozen  western states but sells only to independent
&gt; repair shops at wholesale. It just means they are available to jobbers
&gt; anywhere if they want to carry them.
&gt;
&gt; The sad news about T-II's and shocks is too many original Boge's in good
&gt; order have been replaced by wizbang generic stuff designed to be cheap,
&gt; except for the extra expense of big advertising costs necessary to develop
&gt; sales. Think about how may Boge ad's you've seen lately. They put all the
&gt; value in the product so it sells itself without a flashy campaign. Let's
&gt; see, the original Boges on my 72 are now 30 years old, 180k, and function
&gt; nominal. Superior goods.
