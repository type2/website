&gt;Not sure what your price range is, but I do have brand new N.O.S. 
&gt;German carbs for the '72-74 bus for $369.95/pair. This is about half 

Just a quick note on this:  The engine mentioned in the original post is a
2.0.  These carbs that Ron mentions were designed for a 1.7 and they just
don't breathe enough for a 2.0 motor (ask David Schwarze).
