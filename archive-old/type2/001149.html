Subject: Re: Further to Brake Drums, etc...

I'm starting to see a little clearer here... I had my caliper off the
spindle, disconnected from the brake line, sitting on the garage floor and
STILL it was a huge PITA to get the pistons back far enough to accommodate
the new pads.  As the caliper had free access to expel fluid from the
resevoir, it seems that I need some caliper work.

Now, someone indicated that there exists rebuild kits for calipers.  What is
everyone's preferred method: home rebuild of own calipers or purchase
rebuilt units?  Are these rebuild kits available from FLAPS - are they
rather generic - or are they VW-only and available from folks like BusDepot
and BustedBus?   And how much are they, and how long does it take?  T.P.
will note that I put a price on my time :) and will need figures before I
decide either home repair or outright purchase (and exchange).

Lastly, at the risk of beating a dead horse, how exactly would a faulty
caliper cause the &quot;wah-wah&quot; sound?  Could my caliper be hosed and still I
need a rotor?  The idea saddens me.

Thanks for all of your patient guidance,

&gt; Easily is a relative term...ie relatively easily...they don't just slide
back,
&gt; as there is a very tight seal around the outside of the caliper piston
that the
&gt; piston has to move through, and you are pushing back a quantity of brake
fluid
&gt; in the system at the same time...it needs to be relatively tight to keep
the
&gt; fluid in without leaking out past the piston when brakes are applied...I
should
&gt; be more learned with my wording after all these years....LOL
&gt;
&gt; My tool of choice here for returning the piston to the rest position is a
4-5&quot;
&gt; C-clamp, and one of the old pads laid across the top of the piston....with
the
&gt; caliper unbolted from the spindle, and off rotor, I like to see a two
finger and
&gt; thumb turn of the business end of the clamp (the t-handle end you screw
in)...if
&gt; you have to muscle it, or use brute force to move the piston back in, the
&gt; caliper should be rebuilt...and from experience, I NEVER replace one
&gt; caliper...always the pair....otherwise you end up with a pull, and end up
&gt; replacing the second one shortly afterwards anyways...and BTW...$70 ea
isn't a
&gt; bad price for rebuilt if they're done well...try a 914 rear, or GTI rear,
and
&gt; you'll know what sticker shock is...
&gt;
&gt; My rule on hub or drum is....if I'm doing just shoes as a maintenance
routine,
&gt; and I know the star wheels and cylinders are working well, and not
leaking, then
&gt; I just do the drum...cylinders, or removal/free-up of star adjusters gets
the
&gt; hub out of the way.._dot_usually, on a new to me bus...it's the hub off the
first
&gt; time, just to see how much play there is in the bearings, since they don't
get
&gt; greased or serviced for years at a time if ever...
&gt;
&gt; Have fun...

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'll check the rotors against a 10mm wrench this afternoon.  And, I am
sad
&gt; &gt; to report that the pistons DID NOT go back into the caliper easily to
make
&gt; &gt; room for the pads.  In fact, I had to use a screwdriver laid across the
&gt; &gt; piston with as-even-as I could get pressure to force them back in... if
my
&gt; &gt; caliper is hosed, can it be rebuilt?  By whom?  How much?  I'm not keen
on
&gt; &gt; the idea of buying new calipers _at_ $90-ish a pop.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And T.P.: I suspect you are absolutely right when you mentioned recently
&gt; &gt; that removal of the hub makes installing brake shoes and cylinders
easier...
&gt; &gt; while I accomplished it with just the drum removed, it certainly would
have
&gt; &gt; been nice to have the extra room to play with.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Additionally, I did not lubricate (gasp) nor did I do the 25mph
&gt; &gt; go-and-brakes.  With all that bloody noise coming from the wheel, I
wasn't
&gt; &gt; about to start jamming things up!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Cheers

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sounds to me like you have a siezed caliper...did you put fresh pads
on,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and did the pistons go back into the caliper easily when you pressed
&gt; &gt; &gt; them back to make room for the pads to go in?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; As to noise generally, did you clean the calipers well, then apply
&gt; &gt; &gt; lubricant at the points where the pad backing plates rub on the backs
and
&gt; &gt; &gt; sides?? Then break in the new pads with a quick 25mph moderate braking
&gt; &gt; &gt; every 1/4 mile for 2 miles or so??
