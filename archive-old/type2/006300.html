Are you sure that tray is an original part?

I spent several years traveling and camping in an identical '72 Campmobile,
right down to the color, and I don't remember such a tray.  My buddy was the
original owner of the bus, and he bought it off the showroom floor.

I've owned both a '68 and a '70 Campmobile since 1978.  I was/am the 2nd
owner of both, and neither bus has that tray.  I don't believe it shows up
in the Westfalia Campmobile manual, either.

FWIW.....

fridge.  &lt;&lt;
