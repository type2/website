Subject: RE: [T2] Re: There's always more to the story... - Update

&gt;Volvo's home. There's a short somewhere. I had the GWB idling and jumpers
to
the volvo. 13.46 or whatever volts would drop to 11.3 if I turned the
starter on the Volvo. And STICK THERE even after I removed the key until I
pulled one jumper clamp up and then put it back on. Really odd. Something's
shorting and stays shorting until power drops. A relay maybe? Hmm... The OD
relay's been bad for a while... Anybody got one?&lt;

We had a Volvo 480 with a similar infuriating problem .. we tried everything
new alternator, battery etc etc ..

It turned out to be the &quot;Megafuse&quot; which was an 80Amp fuse on the output of
the alternator which had broken down and had high resistance ..
