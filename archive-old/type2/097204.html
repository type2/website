Subject: Re: [T2] Installation of Espar Heater

[...]


&gt; Looked through the archives on this and didn't find anything.  I'm looking
&gt; for someone that is experienced with installing an Espar heater.  I have a
&gt; complete one that came with the last bus that I purchased and would like to
&gt; get it installed.


If it is a BN 4, I have a heater book with all the templates on where to put
the holes in an early bay. It is on-line here:

Lots of info and how to install it and test it.
