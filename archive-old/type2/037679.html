&gt; Okay folks dont laugh.
&gt; I have had this 73 automatic for some time and have taken it MANY miles.
&gt; tranny is...shall we say, &quot;ready to do somthing&quot;. It does sound like the
&gt; engine is kind of at to high an RPM at 50 to 55mph..I dont even know if
&gt; this is &quot;normal&quot;. I need to know what to look and hear for from and
&gt; automatic that could be ready to crash. Does it make sounds that are

you know this tranny and if it &quot;feels&quot; different you are right to check
things,  automatics have a bad habit of giving no warning when they crash,
sometimes though if you look carefull you can see some signs.

change your tranny fluid, check the pan in bright sunlight, any/much metal
filings??
check the tranny filter, any bits of metal or Brake band materiel??

if it is rev'ing but not going check that you have sufficient fluid.
 then it is possible that the problem is

yup, know the look

&gt; I will rebuild if needed but man, I think it will be a hunt for the rite mechanic and parts!

the older vacuum box is very hard to find parts for and not as &quot;strong&quot; as
the newer govenor box, I would consider looking for an older box or
finding a newer box and converting the van to use it, not that big a job.

and the newer one is the same as a rabbit tranny so the parts are
avaliable
