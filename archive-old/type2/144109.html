Subject: Re: [T2] fuel pump troubleshooting on 78 2.0 FI.

The engine was running perfectly prior to dropping it for the 
transmission swap. I disconnected the fuel rail and segments of the 
wiring harness which would prevent the engine from coming out: 
harness-&gt;ECU, double relay, double relay ground, voltage regulator, and 
the alternator-&gt;starter solendoid (if I recall correctly). I'll
determine whether it starts while running the fuel pump directly or not,
as well as whether electricity is getting to the pump during cranking.

I guess I'm not understanding the flow of electicity during starting to
the fuel pump. I'll hit the bentley again and see if I can figure out
what is supposed to be happening. I would have sworn the fuel pump
kicked on with the key in position 2, Run, prior to replacing the
transmission; but, it is entirely possible I'm confusing the Volvo's 
behavior with the bus -- my Volvo is D-Jet.

&gt; and it
&gt; appears the fuel pump should be pumping with the key in both the run and
&gt; start positions.
&gt; 
&gt; This is not true.  The fuel pump should be pumping when the key is in 
&gt; the START position (via the double relay), and it will also run when 
&gt; when the key is in the ON position, but only if the engine is running 
&gt; and the flapper door is moved from its stationary postition.  I don't 
&gt; know how well you understand the AFM, but there's a little switch in 
&gt; there that turns the fuel pump on.  It's a good safety device because if 
&gt; the engine dies, the pump also stops.
&gt; 
&gt; So, probably the next thing I'd do is put a test light up to the fuel 
&gt; pump wires and crank the engine.  If it lights, then you know your fuel 
&gt; pump part of your double relay is working.  You might not be getting 
&gt; power to your ECU which would keep the engine from running as well.  Do 
&gt; you have all the injector wires hooked up correctly?
&gt; 
&gt; One last thing, you mentioned that the pump works if you apply current 
&gt; directly to it.  Does the engine run when you do this?  Just curious if 
&gt; you have all the other FI components hooked up correctly.
