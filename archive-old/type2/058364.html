&gt;Any sugesstions on balancing?  Anything? 

First, the damaged needle's gotta go.  Different tip shape, different
fuel flow; no way to balance fuel at idle.  Second, air flow thru the
carbs is balanced both at idle and at hi speed (~2500 rpm).  The
procedure is pretty straightforward.  If  you'd like, I can dig up the
procedure in my Muir books, and e-mail it to you.  As far as tools go, I
use a Uni-Syn for multiple carb work, but you can get by with a piece of
garden/heater hose.  You'll use the hose to listen to and compare air
flow thru the two carbs.  The intensity of the 'hiss' will guide you. 
Yeah, I know, we're talkin' stone-age here, but trust me, it'll get you
_very_ close.  8-)  Just make sure you place the ends of the hose at
_right_ angles to the air horn AND to your ear.  This will keep your ear
drums from getting sucked outta yer head!! 

&gt;I am about to chuck these things
&gt;and save up for a single progessive Weber.

Let me know!  8-D   Seriously, if you decide to go Weber, talk to the
list FIRST.  The jetting takes some attention to get right; they're not
_perfect_ out of the box.  If you change the jets before you install, I
understand the power increase is impressive.  But box-stock is
disappointing: flat spots, touchy idle, mediocre mileage, etc.  I realize
I'm repeating second-hand info here, so please query the list before
spending $$$$.
