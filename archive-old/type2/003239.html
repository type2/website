Hi All.

Well the Contraption (73 Westy) finally awoke from 5 1/2 months of
hibernation for its first spring run.
    I installed the battery I had removed in the fall and  after several
cranks it fired to life !
The 20 mile drive home was thankfully uneventful.
Today I removed the rear 3 pisces of engine tin to strip and repaint as well
as cleaned around the compartment before installing a new engine seal. The
seal install went quick but was tough under the left side under the gas
heater. (thats another job)
I also replaced the unserviceable thermostat with a new one,changed the oil
and filter too.
Tomorrow ill check the valves and timing and take her for a spin!

Note: The moth balls I put in the bus last fall were completely
disintegrated but man what a smell!

Later
Phil Gowdy
