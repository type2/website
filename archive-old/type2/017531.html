Hello to everyone, especially in the West Midlands of the UK.

Woodman pub, almost opposite Mc Donalds, Halesowen WM at 7.00pm Bank

We did the National VolksWorld Show last w/e some terrific buses and it
was great to drive in the sunshine - who needs heaters? (say that after
June).

2,500 of the UK's VW Vans along with 10,000 VW Van fans were at Vanfest
