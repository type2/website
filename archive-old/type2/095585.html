Subject: Fuel pressure

Our 82 Westy has an interesting phenomenon happening.  History has been jump
in, turn the key and off I go.  Recently it has become jump in for the first
start of the day and crank for up to 20 seconds before the engine wants to
fire.  After that first start it fires right away, as long as it hasn't sat
for more than a couple of hours.  So, I believe my problem to be either the
fuel pump or the pressure regulator allowing a slow loss of pressure over
time. My question is how can I test to fine out which it is? Any help would
be appreciated!

Mark
