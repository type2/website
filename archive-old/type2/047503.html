&gt;I am trying to get a spare engine running, to install in my '72 bus.  I went

&gt;side (cylinders 3 and 4) has two, 17mm bolts, one located very close to the
&gt;upper right intake manifold mounting stud, and the other located near the
&gt;upper left stud.  The bolts interfere with the manifold.  What are these
&gt;bolts for, and can I remove them without causing problems?

Those bolts are an indication that you have a '73 or '74 head on that side.  The bolts are plugging the air injection holes.  You can try a couple of different things:

1.  Remove 17mm bolts and replace with allen-head bolts (risky - holes strip easily)
2.  Use the thick one-piece gaskets (normally used for FI) in place of the metal ones.  This might give you the clearance you need and the Dellorto book tells you to do this anyway.
3.  Grind down the manifolds.

I hope you have the Dellorto-specific 11mm-headed nuts to go with the Dellorto manifolds, or you will find yourself with still more grinding to do.

Also, if the right head doesn't have at least one air-injection hole, then you are running two different year heads on the engine, which is not a great idea since you likely have different combustion chamber shapes, compression ratios, and even valve sizes from side to side, unless someone took great care to prevent it (not likely).  Unless you are confident of the history of this engine, I wouldn't trust it to any long trips.
