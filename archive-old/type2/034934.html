Subject: no output from [new] fuel pump.

Hi, folks.  

Last week I had questions about my fuel-starved bus.  
Started fine, low idle, died when I tried to 
accelerate.  Got tons of advice [thanks, everyone!], 
spent the last week going over the fuel delivery 
system.  

I've drained and sloshed the tank and replaced the fuel 
screen in the tank [which had 30 years of crud in it, 
but I don't think it was enough to be the obvious and 
only source of my problems]; replaced all the fuel 
lines [found and fixed a nasty surprise-waiting-to-
happen]; replaced the Boscar fuel pump with another 
one; rebuilt the carb [Yes, Jaime, I rebuilt it!  I 
swear!]; and put fuel filters inline on both sides of 
the pump, for now, just to be able to see if the fuel's 
flowing.  [Hoover's convinced me; the one between the 
pump and carb will come out when this is all 
straightened out.]

Now there's no gas coming from the pump to the carb.  

I replaced a Boscar [for engine w/alternator] with the 
same, so I didn't check or mess with the push-rod.  
I've been through the manuals and the archives and I 
KNOW that the correct rod length is specified in there 
somewhere, but I can't find it anywhere.  Just for the 
greater good, could someone post that info here?  

I'm going out now to measure the rod, make sure it 
hasn't mushroomed at the bottom, and double check how 
far above the block it's extending at full stroke.  

Anything else I should be looking for?

I'm irritated that this is dragging on so long, but at 
least there's this advantage to being a poor 
diagnostician:  A lot of other parts get replaced on-
time or sooner than they might have otherwise, as a 
result of all the things you checked that WEREN'T the 
problem.  So there's that comfort, I suppose.

thanks
