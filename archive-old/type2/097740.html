Subject: fuel pump

i was wondering if anyone knew how many pounds of pressure a stock 1600dp 
fuel pump put out... do they pump enough fuel to supply my dual 34 solex 
carbs? right now i have an electric fuel pump feeding them but my bus has 
been diesiling.. i think thats what you call it.. it wants to keep running 
when you shut it off, could the electric fuel pump be the cause if its 
pumping to much gas?  thanks  scott 71 vesty
