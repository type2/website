    Depending on where you look.

 &gt;&gt;

Think outside the box...I saw a barn in PA that a couple of local sports
car racers had set up for their &quot;shop&quot;. The &quot;lift&quot; was a 7,500 lb cap-
pacity propane fork lift bought with a blown trans for $100. They set
the fork lift in place and when needed, drove or pushed a vehicle across
the blades, set sliding steel blocks to catch the frame and up she went.
A pair of steel pins through the mast locked the forks. I don't know if
I'd do it, but it worked for them...
Again, check out the local shops...Those electric lifts are around and
somebody is selling one closer than you think.
