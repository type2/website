Subject: RE: Auxillary Battery

&gt; I'd like to set up a second battery in my bus. Can someone give
&gt; me info on the best way to do this without draining both batteries and
ending up
&gt; stranded?



Speaking of this, I will have more of those genuine Hella dual battery relay
kits that were so popular in about 30 days, coming on my next shipment from
Europe.  As before, list member price will be $18.95.  I sold a ton of these
to list members last summer.  They are designed specifically for VW and
similar campers, allowing both batteries to charge when driving and
isolating them when camping.  Instructions included.
