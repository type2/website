&gt; Any danger to that oh-so-expensive diesel injector pump running veggie-oil? 
&gt; I love diesels and plan to buy a diesel if i can find what I want (Passat 
&gt; TDi wagon) next time we need a car. Would love to have the TDI in my Westy... 
&gt; If i ever go watercooled it would be a Subbieroo 6 cylinder or the VW TDI.

   Seems the solution to using veggie is extra filtering and 
pre-heating...Other than
that oil's oil... ;-)
BTW, where does that used veggie oil go if not into someone's tank...I know 
my
mechanic friend has a (shhhh!) illegal, immoral, and probably fattening waste
oil furnace in his shop that's been there for decades (not that he'd ever 
think
of using it... ;-(
