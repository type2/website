Subject: Locking Gas Cap

Does anyone know where I can find a locking gas cap for a California '78 
with catalytic convertor? I've been to several local FLAPS and none carry 
one that will fit. The plugs which lock the cqp in place are all too long 
and won't pass through the opening for the unleaded fill spout. I thought 
about changing the filler neck and elbow but then it won't pass SMOG and, 
besides, I don't want to have to change it back every time I have to have 
her smogged. Any ideas?  TX.
