&gt;&gt;If you're going to Phoenix to check out VW's, whether it's a bus or a
&gt;&gt;camper,
&gt;be sure to check with LeSueur's VW in Tempe.

Yeah! thank you so much, David! When i was in Arizona last fall, i picked
up one of those car classifieds magazines, and i caught their ad. i've
since tossed the magazine, but i've been wanting to get in touch with them.
for my purposes [having exactly 3 days in which to find and buy a bus,
becuase it'll take 4 to do the registration paperwork and a week to get
home], going through a dealer is somewhat preferable. they'll at least take
a credit card, i hope.

anyway, i've been looking around for this info, and i remembered that it
was La-something-or-other. I'm gonna give them a call this week.

thanks again,
