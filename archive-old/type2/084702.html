&gt;&gt;Hi Folks,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I came up with the idea of a &quot;water injection system&quot; which goes=20
&gt;&gt;something like this:
&gt;&gt;It all seems to work (in theory), but I'm sure there are problems with=20
&gt;&gt;localized cooling and different rates of metal expansion and contraction.
&gt;&gt;Anybody care to jump in on this one?

That's an experiment worth running. I suggest an atomizing injector=20
directed at the fan. You absolutely must avoid waiting until the oil temps=
=20
go up, then hit the spray. That could well stress things sorely if the rate=
=20
is too high. If you see a puff of steam in your rear view after hitting the=
=20
button it could be followed by a ca-chunk.

You will have to do some running tests to determine quantities of delivery.=
=20
Some science supply, botany sections, will have small atomizers for water,=
=20
as well as pumps designed for small delivery rates. Select several sizes=20
for experimenting. It sounds to me that if it works out to a gallon or two=
=20
per hour will give a good 10% or more efficiency, knocking 25=B0 out of=
 250=B0,=20
I would surely pursue it if I lived in the hot summer SW US or did a lot of=
=20
summer mountain grades.

Other issues. If you use too high a rate or get any liquid water hanging=20
around the top of the motor, be sure you do something about sealing the=20
dizzy. It seem to me the proper rate will certainly be less than is=20
required to maintain a dry motor. An automatic temp switch could turn in on=
=20
at say 210=B0F so you would maintain a proper warm up cycle.

For initial criteria, it would be problematic to some to keep refilling the=
=20
reservoir, which is something else that needs some thinking out. You could=
=20
just stap down a 5 gallon drum. How about an air pressure driven beer keg.=
=20
If you get the right kind of atomizer, a hand pump could be used like a=20
party tap. I know in home brew catalogs I have seen 5 gallon hand pump=20
pressure keg systems.

Exact same principle could be used in front of the radiator for 'normal'=20
water cooled machines.

This system should not be used to overcome faults in the stock cooling=20
system. That needs to be right regardless. Then if your using the vehicle=20
in extreme temperature conditions, the water spray could be very helpful in=
=20
stretching outside the envelope of normal stresses.
