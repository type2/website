rotate forward &amp; back and listen. Set parking brake and try to rotate each
wheel both ways. Adjust rear brakes. You might have something loose rattling

front brakes, so you might have no action on one rear drum and not notice
driving. But needs fixin' obviously...

Also look for things hanging loose underneath, and check clutch cable
condition and adjustment.
