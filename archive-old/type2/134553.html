Subject: Re: [T2] What is this part??

Fits it the bottom of the head. Included in factory heads and factory 
rebuilds but not in Brazilian heads. I recently removed a set from some old 
SP heads to put into a new set of SP Brazilian heads. The thermo rod passes 
through the  slot. I assume that head cooling is aided by these pieces or 
the factory would not have included them. They are held into the heads by 
&quot;wedging&quot; so it is not surprising to see one fall out if it had been 
transferred from a factory head.

&gt; From a '71 bus with stock 1600 DP upright. I had my hand up in the area 
&gt; around the thermostat and this dropped out. Does anyone recognize it?
