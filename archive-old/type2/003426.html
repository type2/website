Actually, the fridge is 12V only. It runs on the 12V aux battery or the
transformer.  When you connect the cord to 120V AC, the AC power goes thru
the voltage converter under the bench seat/bed and comes out 12V to the
control panel. When you flip the switch on the panel between city power or
battery, it is still 12V, just the source changes.

The clock in the dash was optional.
It was standard on Champagne Editions.
I believe the original 'Deluxe or not' question was asked about a 67
bus......

&gt; I happen to own a Sage Green 1976 Deluxe Westfalia, and mine is very close
to
&gt; stock, as I bought it from the second owner with 76,000 miles on the
&gt; odometer, but I have no VDO clock on my dash.
&gt;
&gt; 'The Peace Bus' features the 110V refrigerator, stove, 12V sink, water
tank
&gt; in the cabinet, childs cot, and front and rear tables, plus of course the
&gt; outside hookups for water and power.
