Subject: [T2] My 'other' old german vehicle nearly faked me out!

Slightly off the VW marque, but it does involve a part similar to that in 
the VW; it's Friday afterall:
My 33 yr-old BMW 1600-2 with 160,000 original miles on the engine gave me a 
scare this week. After driving for about 20 minutes the oil pressure idiot 
light came on, suggesting that it was either low on oil or that the bearings 
had become so loose that they were unable to maintain pressure, or that the 
oil pump had given up, or that the fuel pump (mechanical) was leaking 
internally and diluting out the oil. After eliminating the low oil and gas 
leak theories, I examined the oil pressure sender unit more closely. 
Interestingly, it was oozing ever so slightly around the bakelite seal. The 
leak became a bit larger as the engine got warmer, leading to a faulty low 
pressure &quot;reading&quot;.
Thus the mystery was solved. But until I found it, I was nearly convinced 
that my time had come to pull the engine for a costly re-build. Interesting, 
how when you own an old clunker you are primed for the worst alternatives. I 
wonder how many of us are faked into doing maintenance that isn't quite 
necessary, just because by all odds it is &quot;time&quot; to do it?
With a new 'lease on life', I remain
