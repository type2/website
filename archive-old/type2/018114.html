Subject: RE:  Child's Hammock / Cot
Message-ID: &lt;37462CCD.25EC0810_at_virtual1.rbw_dot_usu_dot_edu&gt;

I've heard from a few helpful individuals already.  Thanks to Mike,
Chris and Chuck for such prompt, helpful replies!

FYI:  The cot i'm referring to is the one that goes over the driver's &amp;
passenger's seats not the one up in the poptop.  Also, the seller is
Richard (mrhanover) in Highland, CA.

I'm starting to think that 50 bones isn't such a bad price so long as
the canvas is in nice shape, so I don't have to go and immediatly spend
$40 on new canvas.  (As much as I'l like to deal with Dawn at PLF (: )

So anyway, I guess now I just need some reassurance that this hammock
will fit in my bus.  Does anyone who has their hammock for a '70 bus
want to measure their poles for me so I can ensure I get the right
merchandise?

Again, Thanks in Advance!

&gt; I found someone selling a child's cot on the web for $50.  Before I
&gt; contacted him, I thought I would ask the list and find out if anyone had
&gt; an extra one that they could sell me or if this guy even has the right
&gt; one for my bus.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a '70 Westy, and the seller says he has a cot for &quot;'68 and
&gt; later.&quot;  Is this right?  Are the cots this interchangable?
