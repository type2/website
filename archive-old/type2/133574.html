&gt; Greg,
&gt;     The first thing to do is check with the airline and see if he'll
&gt; be able to get any kind of toolbox on the airplane.  I work as an
&gt; aircraft mechanic and years ago when the company sent me on a road
&gt; trip I almost had to leave my tools behind because the airline I was
&gt; traveling on wouldn't let me take them on the plane, not even as
&gt; checked baggage.  I appealed to the Captain of the flight, explained
&gt; the situation, and he let my toolbox ride in the cockpit as a
&gt; professional courtesy to me.  In this post 9/11 world I don't know
&gt; what might happen to your Dad's tools or parts

hmmm, under those circumstances it might be worth purchasing a set of
tools when he gets there, take only the odd or expensive tools.   now I
will say that as a wheelchair user I have a tool kit I carry with me to
perform &quot;personal ride repairs&quot; I have flown several times since 9/11 and
have not had problems taking it as checked baggage, but I haven't flown
international with em.

almost might be worth renting a car on way and driving out there and
leaving it

Bob
