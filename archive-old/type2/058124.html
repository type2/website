Subject: under 60K dead trans??

Hi Todd et al.- being a trans expert on the T2 list,b can you comment on this:
   I bought a 75 bus that's in great shape (only rust is in the door step)
and is claimed to have 60K mi (based on owner history -owner died, sat in
garage 10 yrs; wife sold it to nephew, who got it to guy I bought it from-
this last one drove it only  on a commute of 9mi).
Based upon tired driver seat, trans problem (2nd gear locks up) and low
compression, I suspected 160K mi (although a trans should be good by
then!)- however I adjusted the valves (looked like they had never been
touched- and compression came up to 125 lbs all around.  Other signs
suggest a low milage bus (no nicks in nicely peeling undercoating of wheel
wells or frame, tight steering, perfect headliner, rear seats look like
they were NEVER sat in, sliding door track not worn.  Owner claimed the
trans was a &quot;california rebuilt&quot; that developed same problem in 14k? mi-
are we talking a very poor wierd shifting habit or could there be some
other reason for 2nd gear going &quot;twice&quot;!?  (maybe a bad rebuild of same
trans?)  I drove it home, shifts ok on other gears.  It will go into gear
standing still, but dies when clutch is let out (locked).  You can't get it
into 2nd when driving.  I have a spare trans from Ron Salmon yet to be put
in, but wonder if you have any experience on reasons for
this.   Thanks for the input!
