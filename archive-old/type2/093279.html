Subject: Re: [T2] detinting windows?


&gt; &gt;&gt;Can you detint windows?  Has anyone done this?
&gt;
&gt;my wife used to work at a sign shop, and her best remedy is to put a light
&gt;coat of lighter fluid , let it sit, and you will be able to just wipe it
&gt;away, then clean your windows with a good windw cleaner...

The sign shop I worked for used strong citrus sprays. Never thought very 
well of them...

Sign shop or citrus cleaner for removing adhesive.
