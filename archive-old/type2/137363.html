Indeed.  I street-park my Bus on a public street, and often &quot;hog&quot; a 
spot right in front of my building (working at home and knowing the 
street cleaning schedule helps :-)  But other people do the same 
thing...

&gt; Unfortunately the bus just doesn't &quot;blend-in&quot; and will
&gt; not even if it has a fresh paint job, so I'll have to
&gt; play exactly by the rules, but I have as much right
&gt; parking in any permit spot as my neighbours do!!

Yup!
