Subject: Re: [T2] R12 Availability?

I should have mentioned, that hoses that look like they should be replaced, 
should be replaced, and not to mention that drop in refrigerants are not 
going to be as effective as R-12, and will run at higher temps and pressures, 
which will put any old refrigerant hose to the test.  Plus, keep in mind that 
all vehicles use a semi-hermatic air-conditioning system, which means there 
is at least one moving seal that is exposed.  I do know that the conversion 
will work and last if done properly.
