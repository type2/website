Hey all,

I'm looking at the Bently manual for adjusting the valves.  They say
adjust number 1, roll the engine to number 2 and adjust it, roll the
engine to number 3, etc,etc.

My question is, can I roll number 1 to TDC and adjust 1 AND 3 at
the same time then rull up number 2 and adjust 2 and 4 at the same time?

Seems like I SHOULD be able to do this.

Thanks
Mark
