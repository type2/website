Subject: Re: [T2] engine lid bracket

&gt; Does anyone have a ruler they could measure the bracket on the engine lid,
we
&gt; are restoring a 1972 and I put the bracket on it which I thought was from
&gt;
when we pulled it apart but the lid on the open position hits the rear door
&gt; and on closing the arm hits the engine compartment on its way down, please
&gt; help thanks Dylan

&gt;Bracket?  It should be a spring steel piece that looks like a safety pin.
It
&gt;was the same from 64 to 79. From the bolt end on the lid to the clip
holding
&gt;it together on the bottom end, it is 10&quot; long. Only difference that changed
&gt;over the years were the rollers on the body. Early used 2 metal rollers,
late
&gt;bay used a nylon block.

I had a similar problem when I took the spring steel piece from my '71 parts
bus to use in my '77. There is a difference in length of the spring piece
somewhere in those years. I got the correct length one (I now have a '74
parts bus!!!) and solved the problem.
