Yes, all Stewart Warner gas heaters both exhaust to the outside AND use
outside air for combustion.  NO inside air is used during combustion and if
the exhaust pipe is in good shape and the exhaust flanges are in place,
there will be NO exhaust in the cabin.

If you put the heater in the cabin, it will recycle the inside air, like the
furnace does in your house, thus using less energy to heat it.  If you put
the heater in the engine bay, it will use outside air (unless you put
recycling ducts on it) and you will get the same smells you get with the
standard VW heater system.

For camping, you can put a house thermostat on your heater and it will work
like a house furnace, coming on and shutting off to keep your bus at a
constant temperature all night long.  And gas heaters won't put extra
moisture or fumes in the air.


I have been told by someone I respect that all combustion of hydrocarbons
result in moisture being given of, or do you mean that this gas heater
exhausts to atmosphere rather than in side the bus? regards Mel
