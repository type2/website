Subject: 78 single cab

Hello all,

With the recent talk about how rare double cabs and single cabs are, here is
one for sale ... To be exact, it is car that I was offered by a contact in
Germany and that I can have shipped over here.

1978 single cab, 103,000 km total (about 65k miles). Rebuilt engine (I have
to double check, but I believe that this a 1600 DP) with 3,000 km (2k
miles); Westfalia truck bed (made of wood - wider and longer than factory
bed); treasure chest doors on both sides; vent wings in doors; clock;
speedometer with 6-digit odometer; no mechanical problems. The bad: torn
driver's seat (he will throw in a good one), some rust in the usual spaces
(rockers etc.). Doors are good though. $3000 including shipping to
Baltimore.

I have not seen the car yet and I cannot get pictures either - he does not
have a camera and lacks a computer, too. However, I will be in Germany for
two weeks in July when I could check out the car and put it on the ship.
Anyone who seriously interested should p-mail me and we can take it from
there.

Marcus
