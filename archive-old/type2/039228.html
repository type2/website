if the noise is louder when power is off, drifting, or when going around a
turn.  louder one way than the other but practically goes away or much
quieter while under power even hard power then it most likely is the CV
joint,  (hard part is ??Which one??)


&gt; Muir, their doesn't seem to be any unusual play in the driveshaft/cv

won't be, if it is that loose you are already dead on side of road


don't bother repacking them, by the time they  make this much noise it is
pretty hard to get em quiet (but you can frequently drive a LOoooooong
 way with em making noise)  pick up some new ones, they are relatively
inexpensive and keep at least one of the old ones wrapped in plastic in
the bus for emergencies on your trip
