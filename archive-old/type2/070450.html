Subject: Re: Bumpers ideas

&gt; I have always had no trouble finding front bumpers, but rear bumpers are
&gt; another story. I actually have the correct one for my '67, but as I'm running a
&gt; Beetle exhaust, I didn't want to cut the bumper.

Praise the lord that you didn't cut the bumper!!! :)  Bus exhaust is not _that_ much  more I don't know 
why people were so willing back in the old days to sacrifice rear bumpers to save a few $$

straight original bumpers are becoming more of a precious commodity, between people hacking them 
for beetle exhausts and fender benders there are not a lot of staight ones left

interesting someone told me a story about how their bus was _saved_ because they *did not* have a 
rear bumper. The bus was hit reasonable hard in the rear. Their thinking was that if the bumper had 
been on there it wuld have twisted the frame and rendered the bus junk (due to the fact that the 
bumper is bolted right into the ladder frame underneath)

anyone's thoughts on the matter would be apreciated
