Subject: Re: [T2] Rattle Can Epoxy Primer

Hello Terry,
Way back when (2 years or so), when I first bought a can, I called tech 
support.  I just wanted to make sure it was not Lacquer (didn't want it to be 
porous).  The guy said it wasn't.   I think he said urethane. I think they have a 
specific epoxy primer, but it's not meant to be sanded. He also said I could 
leave it on for 6 months (supposed to be 1 month) without any problems (so he 
sold me the snake oil).  I was ordering some Rust Guard (like POR15) so I tacked 
the primer onto my order. I was only doing a small spot so I tried it.  I 
bought 3 cans.  It lasted for a few different spots.

So I give --what is it?
Liquified fiberglass resin?
Maybe epoxy--
It sure doesn't say much for ingredients--other than a bunch of solvents
&amp; the propane to get the product out of the can---
