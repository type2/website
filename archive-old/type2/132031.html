Subject: Re: [T2] Rust Under the Windshield

&gt; We do sell a reasonably priced repair kit made by AH Schofield in
&gt; England that replaces the metal under the windshield. This will have to
&gt; be welded in. It comes in three pieces, and between the three of them,
&gt; replaces your entire lower windshield lip plus a few inches below it (in
&gt; other words, the area that commonly rusts).

I used these metal pieces from Bus Depot in my repair:

The pieces are the right length and height and general shape but you have to
tweak them slightly to duplicate the compound breaks of the original sheet
metal. If you do you will have a perfect fit with your new seal.

What's nice about the kit is you can use one piece or all 3 and considering
the total cost of repair I think it's worthwhile to use new sheet metal than
tear out and old piece of metal from a junkyard bus which is what's commonly
done.
