&gt; &gt;The short answer is that you can just pop the new lifters in with the
&gt; &gt;regular cam, push rods, and rocker arm springs, and it'll work just
&gt; &gt;fine.  Many have had success with this.  But why spring for new lifters
&gt; &gt;if you are not going to use a new cam?  Setting valves is not that big a
&gt; &gt;deal.  Save that $$ for the real problems you *will* have, I'd say.
&gt; 
&gt; IMO hydraulic lifters are a great investment.  Hydraulics keep your valve
&gt; train in perfect adjustment.  You can't do as well by checking the valve
&gt; lash every 3k miles, or 300 miles, or even every 3 miles.  The hydraulics
&gt; do the same thing continually.  What's more, on a type IV, popping the
&gt; valve covers is a PITA.  Changing to hydraulics is one of the best
&gt; modifications I even made to my bus, and I guess every single auto
&gt; manufacturer agrees with me, since all new cars these days have hydraulic
&gt; lifters.  They also all have some other improvements that have shown to be
&gt; worth their cost and complexity, such as fuel injection and electronic
&gt; ignition.  Arguing against such substantial improvements on the basis of
&gt; cost or engine longevity just doesn't make sense.
