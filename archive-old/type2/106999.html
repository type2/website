Subject: Re: [T2] unpadding dash

&lt;&lt; Technically, I think it's illegal to remove any safety device from a 
vehicle,
&gt;probably including dash padding. Might not be a problem for you in your
&gt;Bus, but an insurance co. 'could' refuse to insure such an altered vehicle
&gt;or refuse to pay medical expenses in case of an accident and injury...;-(


You make a good point. I was getting carried away with aesthetics and 
lost sight of the already thin margin of safety that we walk on :)

Thanks

There usta be an urbane legend that Rolls Royce hoods (or bonnets ;-)
were sealed...The safety rules may make that true for all vehicles...
