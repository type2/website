Boy, do I know that one. My '73, middle seat removed, was piled to seat 
cushion height w/ Coke products. They were running a 50 year anniversary 
special (or some such), and Coke prices were the best ever. Living 20 
miles out of town, it seemed like a good time to stock up. It took 3 
trips w/ the flatbed hand trucks, plus a couple shopping carts, to carry 
all that soda out to the van.

Nope, it doesn't sag, but it sure makes you glad you have the extra 
power and disk brakes. :-)
