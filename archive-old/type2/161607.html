Subject: Re: [T2] Gold leafing a bus.

I agree with Don - it will scratch very easily, and in Seattle is may wear 
off sooner than in other regions.

IME: Gold leaf is a PITA to work with sometimes, it's extremely delicate, 
lighter than tissue paper, and it clings to EVERYTHING. For a large surface 
area, it would be expensive to cover, but just for the curiosity and the 
Louis XIV factor - I'd probably like to see something like a gold leaf bus. 
But, I'm an art teacher, and I like the visual irony of it all.

Anyway - isn't the leafing adhesive water-based? That may not help if you're 
leafing the rusted areas. If you used a spray glue instead, the leaf may 
look a little bumpy. If you're still up for it, when gold leaf is applied 
well it stays on well. But, the first time you wash the area, or dust it 
off, it would get really scratched up.
