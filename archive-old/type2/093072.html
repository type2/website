Subject: Re: [T2] heater cables

Rust and gunk I suppose in the tubes. Also if there is a metal fitting on 
the end of the cables it could be hanging on the edge of the tube out back.

Have you considered clipping the wires off in the front and pulling them 
towards the rear?


&gt;      OK.  I am stumped.  I need to change my heater cables.  I have
&gt;everything unhooked both at the heater control boxes &amp; the dash levers.  I
&gt;have the bottom pan off &amp; I am trying to pull the cables out of the tube
&gt;that runs under the bus.  No luck.  I can't pull hard enough to get the
&gt;cables to budge.  There is a little crimp on one fo the tubes but I think it
&gt;is just from where it bends to go to the heater box.  I am about to use a
&gt;come-along to try &amp; free them up.  Any ideas?  Thanks.
