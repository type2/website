Subject: a few things

Hey all,
It was great to meet a few of you guys and gals in MI.  I hope we can do
it again sometime, I had a great time...and I think Stella did too!  I
had no problems the whole trip...except for a leaky valve cover gasket
and my idle cutoff solenoid came a little loose...but that took all of 5
mintues to fix.  I ran cool all the way, 65-70mph most of the
way...sometimes a hair faster or slower.  Stella loved it.  She starts
better now, and runs a bit better.  I wonder why?  Maybe she just needed
to go out and play?  This was the first time in a few years she has been
out of state...and the first time I've taken her out of state....and she
did great...I'm so proud!

anyways....Chris, if you're out there...please email me back?  I'd like
you to send me those pictures from the show :)  Chris Huff that is.  I
lost your email adress already! sorry.

I feel like being nice to Stella's front end after that jaunt.  I'm
thinking of at least repacking the wheel bearings and changing the
grease in the beam.  Anything else i can do to help it out?  I've
already stuck new shocks on and have rebuilt my brake calipers with new
pads and all that jazz.

adios,
Isaiah
