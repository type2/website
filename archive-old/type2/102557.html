Subject: re:Bizarre failing in 75 FI; fuel liny query

Mike- Mines a 75 but not FI, and I found a gauze inside the fuel tank, this 
drops out from below when I removed the nut holding the pipe that the fuel 
hose connects to underneath the tank. Its a tight spot but I did mine with 
the fuel tank out but I don't see any reason why you can't do it from 
underneath once the tank is drained. I give information on the fuel tank 
restoration I did a couple of years ago on my web site at:

&gt; To list- you seem knowledgable on parts----My ex-Porsche mechanic that
&gt; did Nyssa's bus figures over the phone that the 75 likely had fuel
&gt; starvation -its main clue was that after it refused to make it up a hill
&gt; (push clutch in, rev it up, let it out, goes &quot;plup-plup-plup&quot; and has NO
&gt; poop (no acc), I let it sit to wait for my wife to bring a
&gt; chain....after ten min checked it, and it ran OK enough to get home the
&gt; next 2 miles.
