Subject: burning oil

Hey all,
I met a nice couple from my old hometown the other day while at a lake
enjoying the sunset with the 62.  They told me about how they just
bought a nice 70 bus from AZ for their daughter, and are having problems
with it.  The motor is a very recent MoFoCo rebuild (thats the problem
right there) and they have it at a shop right now...but the guy isn't
doing anything (its been sitting for 7 weeks untouched) so they asked me
if I'd like to do some work on it...I accepted.
The motor runs pretty smooth at idle...I haven't driven it or
anything...but when it starts up...all is normal...but after a minute or
so...it starts smoking really bad.  I'm thinking piston rings...but I
could be wrong.  Why would this be happening??  Oil can get in and burn
through a few places.... worn valve guides, and worn piston
rings...correct?  this is a recent rebuild...and he said he was driving
along at 50mph and all the sudden power just dropped and he could only
do 35 or so...and it started smoking real bad.  It only does about 35mph
max now.  I'm thinking he burnt a hole in the piston?  I haven't looked
at it real close yet as its raining pretty bad here... but thats where
I'm at now.
My plan is to find a good rebuilt motor...or have this one rebuilt as
mofoco is 100% pure crap.  I have many cases to prove this if you really
want to know about them.  The most recent being a friends thing
motor...the cam gear came loose caused some major problems.
anyways...don't get me started on mofoco.

Any ideas anyone??
