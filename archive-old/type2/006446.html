Given a functional door seal it should hold cold for 3+ days using a typical
grocery store bag of ice.  That's been our experience over many years with a
'68 and now a '70 Westy, even in summer weather.

There should be a coated wire rack inside to hold the ice.  It goes in the
top of the icebox.

Under the rack should be a plastic drip shelf, with a recessed central area
to hold water and connected at its right front [front is front] to a plastic
drain hose.  The nipple which connects to the hose is a weak point, and
often leaks due to cracks in the plastic around its mounting.  These plastic
shelves become very brittle with age, so handle it gently if you reposition
it, reconnect the drain hose, etc.

With these bits in place and functioning [check the drain hose for blockage]
MOST of the meltwater will go down the drain.  The drip shelf is shallow
enough that it allows some water to spill over the edges during [relatively]
high-G maneuvers.

A simple way to keep the food dry if the drain system is iffy or missing is
to seal the ice in a couple of plastic trash bags, making sure the sealed
openings are on top.

It's definitely worth the effort to make sure meltwater is under control.
The first time you drop your feet in cold water on the floor as you leave
the bunk in the morning you'll curse yourself for being negligent :-)

&gt;&gt;  I have been thinking about the functionality of the Westy icebox unit
in the 68 to 73 campers. Please share you experiences and ideas for
making it work. What works best:dry ice, dry ice, frozen ziplock bags
of ice, use the ice box for dry storage :) ?

BTW, many folks just remove theirs and perhaps for good reason but I
want to make a go of it.  &lt;&lt;
