Subject: Re: [T2] Small Propane Tank

I have read words to this effect here many times:

&gt;There IS NO new rule for Westfalia installed propane cylinders
&gt;the regs clearly say EXEMPT!

And I have read -interpretations- like this:
&quot;The 2001 version of the same code states that horizontal cylinders are
exempt from an overfill protection device (OPD) retrofit as long as the
cylinder was manufactured prior to Oct. 1, 1998. That means that these
cylinders can be legally recertified after 12 years without making
modifications. The tanks mounted to motorhomes (designated as ASME
tanks) are not subject to this regulation.&quot;

And, since the rule itself supposedly applies only to tanks between 4
and 40 pounds, I assume all of this means our 3 lb horizontal tanks are
exempt, but even so there is enough confusion around that I'm sure it
will come down to interpretation on the part of the staff at each
filling station.

Anticipating this situation, I would like to carry the applicable
section of the actual regulation in my glove box. So I'll ask the list
again: 
Does anyone have a copy of the applicable section of the regs that can
be shared with list members? Or even the page or section numbers?

Thanks,
