Subject: Re: [T2] fuel and vaccum lines

Is this little box white? If so, it is probably the
fuel filter although I have not seen one that was
mounted to the fire wall before.

What type of carb is on your 72 bus? Do you have the
stock dual carbs or just a single unit? 

Good Luck!

Have a great day!

&gt; I have a solid rubber

&gt; have a braided type of 
&gt; line, which I thought was the gas line but after
&gt; taking a close look im not 
&gt; sure. The braided line goes through this small box
&gt; that is attached to the 
&gt; chassis and on the box are a bunch of numbers (im
&gt; not sure if they were the 
&gt; part number but it didnt look like it) and it says
&gt; &quot;FLOW&quot; with an arrow.
