Subject: stuck sunroof on 69

scenario: 69 decent shape sunroof is available in the next town over. the
crank on the sunroof turns but not opening the hatch; feels like its not
catching. up front a few inches right (passenger side) of the crank it
appears as if at least one of the cables is binding, perhaps broken/bunged.
i didn't want to force it hard with the headliner being pretty good. any
solutions? what might be a next step?   -steve
