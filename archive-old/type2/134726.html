Subject: Re: [T2] Charging Problem

From: &quot;Casting Fool&quot; &lt;jester_at_cfnson_dot_com&gt;
&gt; I'm hoping that this is the reason for the charging problem and an easy
fix.

I got under the bus a few minutes ago and found that there are four wires
attached to the starter lug, and two attached to the spade connectors.  Of
the four attached to the lug (stud with nut), there's a lead that, from the
gauge, obviously goes to the battery.  Then there are three red wires.  The
smallest is plain red, the next size up in gauge is red, and the largest is
red with a white stripe.

According to the wiring schematic, that's the right number of wires going to
that lug on the starter.

I looked closely at the loose wire in the engine compartment.  It is red all
along it's length.  It's about the same gauge as the red with white stripe
mentioned above.  At some time in the pat, the last 6 inches of wire was
replaced with a red wire of the same gauge as the original.  The connector
on the end of this wire is easily large enough to go on the lug on the
starter.

Here's the kicker.  I just used my digital volt meter to check the loose
wire.  With the engine off, it's at zero volts.  With the engine at idle,
it's at 33 volts.  Rev'ing the engine up (using the carb linkage), and it
drops down to something like 15-19 volts.  What the heck?

I am so very lost...
