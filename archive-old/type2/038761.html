&gt; &gt;  Don't worry, be happy! I'm sure these will be fine. You might like to
&gt; &gt; try and get an opportunity to drive a bus with higher rated tyres in a
&gt; &gt; crosswind, though, you may be surprised at the difference.

yup, for sure, I have Michelin MXT 205/70 tires with a 99S load rating,
the difference is very noticable

&gt; However, if you start to perceive a vibration, be sure to stop and examine
&gt; the tires for a telltale lump or bulge that indicates that the tread is
&gt; about to separate soon.  Michelins seem to do this now and then with nasty
&gt; results to your bodywork.

BTDT, if you feel it STOP and check, then check again
