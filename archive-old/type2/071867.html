I replaced the old crappy messed up pushrod with a new one, and it worked 
even worse, so either the pump decided to die all together or I messed it up 
somehow, but i'm just going to bypass all that crap and go eletric so i don't 
have to worry about it any more.

 Are you sure that you checked your pushrod length? and extension.  If
 it's wrong you can screw up the pump or simply have it not work. 
 Check the Bentley manual for the correct specs for your pump.
 
 I've found that mechanical pumps are far less prone to failure than
 the electric pumps I've tried.
