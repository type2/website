Subject: tdc?  

is top dead center (tdc) the same on all 72-79 type iv's???

my timing scale reads tdc different than where it truly is.  i pulled
a spark plug #1 and felt exactly where tdc was.  for me the notch in
my fan pulley lined perfectly vertical (like on the old upright
motors), yet my scale reads tdc, like 2 inches over to the left.  

if i went with what the scale would read, IF it went that far, tdc
would read at like about 16 atdc!!

any thoughts on this??  normal?  

thanks
zzz
