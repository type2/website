Subject: Mr Whipy's back!

Sorry not to post for a while (not to mention the sorry state of the Events
page -sorry Ken- :(  ).

For those of U that remember we have a factory high-top Camper that was in
for ALOT of work
on a tight buget (so what's new). To refresh the grey cells, last year he
bit off several fingers of
a would be theifs hand, when a sheet of steel slid out the freshly
crow-barred cargo door, gave me
a deep warm sense of justice I can tell U. Well having had several family
members &amp; friends die this
year, the bus has not been the priority I would have wished for (can't
belive Cameron our son was
1 year old last Saturday). Anyway he is now white over orange, with new
interior (baby bits 'n' all!) &amp;
is ready to hit the road, tappets &amp; tuneing to be done this week ready for
trip this Saturday. I took
him out last night for a 20 mile run on the freeway to get some rev's back
in &amp; did a comfy 60-65mph
most of the way. Brand new VW heat exchangers just as useless, but not as
smelly! BA6 however
ROCKS!! That with the LPG heater on meant that the window was down _at_ 65mph _at_
night in the rain!
JK provided the vibes &amp; for 30 mins I was the happiest I have been for
toooooooo long (Long story, not
a happy ending), nice to get back though &amp; put him to bed. Denise knew I was
stoaked &amp; was not suprised
when I woke Cameron (come on it was a good cause-honest!). And so to bed to
dream of open roads
&amp; wonder why 3 people living with 6sq feet of foot space can be so happy
when we feel cramped in
2000sq feet _at_ home? Must be the view!


Happy holidays form the UK
