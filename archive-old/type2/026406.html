Subject: Westy Alternator Cable(was: Conections of my T4 alternator)

Hmmm...guess I'll want one of these eventually so I can install the fridge I got. If anyone has one spare, please keep me in mind.

Thanks! Joe

...
&gt;&gt;There's one black cable
&gt;&gt;left that has a transparent plug too, but it's not conected to the black
&gt;&gt;plug.

Karl replies:
&gt;
&gt;Do you have a Westy?  Or did this alternator harness come from a Westy? That 
&gt;black wire comes from stator output on the back of the alternator. It goes 
&gt;to the aux. relay to charge the aux. battery.
