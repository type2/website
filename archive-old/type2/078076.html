Joe said
&gt; Biggest PITA was that, with no space behind the ring eyes, you're _just_
barely gripping it and the ring tends to pop off at the exact moment it
looks like it will come
&gt; out.  Thus the screwdrivers.
Amen brother..... Just did that last weekend..  The correct tool will take
minutes of time of the installation and cut down the frustration factor. But
if not definitely have a few small screwdrivers to help pry..

Peace brothers,
Snoopy
