Subject: oil temp gauge problem/question

I just installed a VDO oil temp gauge and sump plate sender in my '76
Westy.  I have power/ground to the gauge and to the gauge light -- the
sender is connected to the proper terminal in the back of the gauge.  The
light works when I turn on the headlights; however; the gauge itself does
not appear to be functioning.

The only response that I am getting from the gauge is a slight rise off of
the resting post while the bus is running -- there is never any response
from the gauge reflecting temperature rise (I have taking some trips, which
should be getting the engine to operating temperatures).  Is there any way
to test the gauge itself to determine if there is some internal problem? or
does this perhaps sound like a ground issue with the sump plate sender?
Full disclosure -- I used a little permatex hylomar at the sender/sump
plate interface to assist in sealing.

Thanks for any input.
Chris.
