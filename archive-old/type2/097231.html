Subject: Vacuum questions

Howdy All,
Hope you all had a great Christmas, and New Years.
Just a quick question regarding manifold vacuum. I have just hooked a gauge to
me '77 dual carb. 2L motor. The Engine is getting on a bit in age (not sure
how far this motor has been) but still runs fine. At hot idle it gives a very
steady 18-19&quot; Hg, and judging from the archives this is acceptable. Can I
assume that I have no vacuum leaks?
The reason I ask is the gauge seems unusually quick to plummet down to 0, even
for a very slight acceleration.
Thanks for your help,
Richard,
Brisbane Australia
