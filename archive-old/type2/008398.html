&gt;Last week, someone on one of these two lists made the comment to the
&gt;effect of &quot;New, type IV case, let me know where they are&quot;
&gt;
&gt;You can find them and new heads at
&gt;http://www.ismi_dot_net/riecherttuning/cylinsale.htm  $480 US
&gt;

I am a little confused about his wording in his ad. On the first page 
the $140 heads fit 411/412/2.0. But when you click on 'other heads for 
sale' the $140 heads ONLY fit 1.7. 2.0 heads are $330.
