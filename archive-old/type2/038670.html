Subject: Re: EFI sputtering

Check your fuel filter first. If it's not that, you've most likely got
goonk in your gas tank. Rust, probably. It clogs the outlet in the tank,
you &quot;run out of gas,&quot; then it floats happily away and you can run again
for a while. BTDT....

&gt; Problem with 77 Westy with EFI...
&gt; After driving down the highway for about the 20 minutes my engine starts
&gt; sputtering eventually cuts out. If I wait 10 minutes or so it will run fine,
&gt; but in maybe another 10 minutes it sputters and eventually dies an ugly
&gt; death. It starts subtly with a few misses and gets more and more harsh. Kind
&gt; of like running out of gas.
&gt; 
&gt; The amount of time the engine runs is directly proportional to the amount of
&gt; ride time I get until the sputtering starts. Any ideas?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks! Marvin

&gt; PS My tire guys happily swapped out the light truck tyres he installed for
&gt; some C rated cooper tires, he has not installed them yet, but I appreciate
&gt; all of the advice.
