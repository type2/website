&gt;
&gt;Hello Thom;   My wife and I recently came across your web page and really
&gt;enjoyed it. We appreciate the work you have put into it. We have owned a
&gt;77 bus that we bought back in 1980. It's been an interesting
&gt;relationship of some 230,000 miles.
&gt;
&gt;I'd been having some problem lately with the engine intermittently
&gt;deciding not to run, anywhere from 5 seconds to 5 minutes for no apparent
&gt;reason. Never broken long enough to diagnose. Earlier today I decided to
&gt;try to figure out the location of a new external oil leak and in the course 
&gt;of checking the oil pan screen - rats! - chunks of metal, maybe rod bearing 
&gt;stuff. I don't know a lot about internal engine specifics but its looking 
&gt;like I am going to try to find a shop to diagnose this engine part problem.  
&gt;I was wondering if you have any suggestions on VW, auto or machine shops 
&gt;around the Sacramento region that might be worth checking out (or staying 
&gt;away from)to help me with this problem. Like everyone else I'm worried about 
&gt;getting ripped off.  I expect I'll need to get it into a shop that can tear 
&gt;things down enough to find out what broke and then do a fair job at a fair 
&gt;price on the repairs. I'm really cant get into doing the work myself.
&gt;
&gt;I'd really appreciate any leads you could give me on shops around and 
&gt;about. I'm hoping to get the car in somewhere this week or at least make 
&gt;arrangements. We live up in El Dorado County near Shingle Springs and hope we 
&gt;can find a place that isnt to far away although I'd gladly tow this rig 
&gt;somewhere that's reputable.
&gt;
&gt;Again, keep up the great work with the page. And I'd really appreciate 
&gt;hearing from you if you have the time.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks a bunch
&gt;
