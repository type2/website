Subject: RE: [T2] What year is my bus?

&gt; Did the 72 bus have the access hatch to the engine, the one inside &gt; the bus
that is over the engine?

Someone could have put in the panel.

Are your front turns closer to your front bumper or winshield. If bumper then
its a 72, if not then I would say something's odd, maybe a VIN switch or nose
and hatch panel replacement.

Low front turns plus square tails = 72 bus.
