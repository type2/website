Subject: Mystery Squeek

Can anyone point me to a good reference on diagnosing a front-end squeek on my
76?  It sounds very repititous (wheel related) but stops when I turn the
steering wheel.
Not sure where to start.  Since I don't know the vehichle's history I know I
probably need to repack the bearings at some point, but am more concerned
about the immediate need of adressing this squeek.  Since it stops when I turn
and the wheels are still spinning could that mean it's not wheel related?
Thanks,
Mike
