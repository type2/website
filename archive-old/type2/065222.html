Subject: Help on email...Problem solved!

Wow...thanks for all the quick responses.  The solution was a little too
simple..pointing out my ignorance for Windows related functions.  Simply
'CUT' the text from your word processor and 'PASTE'it into the main body of
your message.  Sounded too easy, but I was doing it 10 minutes after posting
the question!  Lotus Blossom provided the info......

Mark...
