Subject: Re: [T2] It just wont run

Where do i find the Air flow meter?

&gt;&gt;Is the coil wired correctly? Is the white wire on the terminal 1?

I dont know, ill have to check that first.  I didnt disconnect it
however, so id bet that its ok.  it was running prior to my invasion.

&gt;&gt;Have you verified the fuel pump is working?

I have not verified that.  Ill to that tonight when i get home.  I
did however pull the wires off of the fule pump when i removed it to
replace the hoses.  the fule pump is marked with a + and - on the 2
poles, and i put a tester on the 2 wires there were attached to it
and one was hot.  that wire i put on the + terminal of the fuel pump.
