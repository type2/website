&gt; Noticed that when i put the bus in reverse the brake warning light came on!

&gt; Next noticed that selecting left hand signal that the brake warning light
&gt; would flash in unison with the signals!
&gt; Tried right hand signals and it worked fine.

I've had this happen.  It turned out to be a bad ground in the left rear
