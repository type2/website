Subject: Re: [T2] clutch cable replacement?

&gt; Hi! The clutch cable snapped on the 78 westy we have come to enjoy.  I have a
&gt; new cable but was wondering if someone could clue me in to the procedure /
&gt; pitfalls/ other items that are needed to be replaced while I am there? I would
&gt; like to do this right the first time....

- Replace the clevis pin
- Inspect the condition of the bowden tube per bentley

Pitfalls:

- installing the two dirt protective boots that may have rotted off may be
hard. You may have to soften them up.

- the cable has to be partially threaded before you put the first boot on.

- dirt under the car that will collect on the greased cable so cleanup
before you work, use cardboard etc.

-  some cables come with a plastic sheath near the front and some don't. The
sheath is necessary because the cable passes through the frame just before
it enters the long tube and will prevent rubbing against the frame

- when tightening the acorn nut, grip the cable at the pinched end with
pliers and rotate the acorn but only. Most cables have a notch in the end
for a screwdriver but it's awkward to get a hand up there most times.

- I greased the spring under the pedal to eliminate some squeaking
