&gt; &gt; I hope that you are right. I have so far been on two 1500 mile journeys in
&gt; &gt; my 1977 bus, but on Wednesday I am taking my bus from Calgary, Alberta to
&gt; &gt; East Troy,WI for the Other Ones concert.
&gt;
&gt; I drove 3k miles from Canada to where I live now.  It was a 7 day trip
&gt; taking the scenic route along the Pacific coast down to LA and we loved it.
&gt;
&gt; Back then I had the rusty gastank problem but we only had to stop once to
&gt; clean the fuel filter.  I kept the highway speeds below 60 and only passed
&gt; two other vehicles the whole way.  Still, with the horsehair seats
&gt; disintegrated these vehicles are remarkable comfortable for long trips.

The speed issue is the key.  Even a Type 1 engine bus can maintain 70, but
not for very long.  55-60 is a good cruise for a well-maintained type 1
engine, 60-65 for the type IV.
