Subject: 1973 bad engine; 1975 bad body

 Here's the question raised by the suggestion that you put a type 4
engine in a 1972....

Someone please summarize the difficulties involved (the big ones) of putitng
my 1975 T4 (FI 1800 with solid lifters) into a 1973 transporter. I am
considering using my body fix money to do that with the engine from the
wrecked Westy instead of fixing the body and re-painting.

Thanks in advance,
Chuck Harvey
1975 Westy (crunched)
1973 Loaf (needs new door seals, has BN4 heater that quit running (needs
priming, I think)
1979 parts bus... running but just barely.
