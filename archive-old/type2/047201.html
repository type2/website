Subject: [T2] RE: Upper Cot

Hi Volks,
An earlier post said

&quot;The manual for my 73 westy said the weight limit for the upper cot was 
100lbs.&quot;

   I'm sure glad I don't have the westy manual for my 71.  If I don't know 
the weight limit it doesn't apply, right?  Something about ignorance is 
bliss...lol... :)

Everybody have a great weekend!
