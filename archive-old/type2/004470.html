&gt;What is the standard chamber size of a stock 2 litre head?  If the head is
&gt;fly cut.030, how may cc's is it lowered?


This is actually a vague question regarless.  I've been looking recently at
a slew of core heads (about 10) some of which have been cut, some stock,
some 2.0 bus, some 2.0 Vanagon, some AMC with the step, some German.  No
hard and fast rules.  Usually around 50cc in the pocket but it varies from
47 to as much as an honest 55 as cast for the ones I have, even one's that
have had no prior work.  As a rule it seems BTW that the cuts AVP makes to
make up volume for surfacing don't really add that much extra, just bring it
back to stock or a little larger.  Frankly if you care and wan't to be safe
cc them yourself.  I'd note you can make nice discs yourself to do it with
one of those adjustable hole saws and a piece of 1/4&quot; plexiglass but you
should use a drill press.  Then use a big syringe from a farm place if a
buret isn't available.  I find piston pockets to rarely be over 16cc BTW
&gt;from the 3 sets (1 KS German, 1 Mahle German, 1 Mahle Brasil) I've looked
at, 15cc is a good safe guess there.
