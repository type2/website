Subject: BN2 Manual 

Hi folks,

Can anyone tell me anything about the BN2 Gas heater.
Like, what vehicle it was on originally. I have one in
exceptional condition and would like to do all the routine
TLC to make this unit safe.

I am looking for a scanned manual, like the ones for the BN6 that
have been listed recently. I know the library does not have it, as they
are using a picture of mine with no documentation.

Thanks in advance.

Matt
