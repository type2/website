Subject: Re: [T2] Power Inverter in a 74 Westy question for the electronics wizards

I use a 600 power inverter to run the fridge on the 110v.  This is 
because the inverter has a cutout at 10.5 volts on the battery.  I also 
run a standard compact flourescent lamp on that inverter.  for the same  
17 watts that the little over sink lamp does i get the effect of a 60 
watt bulb in the back.  very handy with an extension cord that reaches 
right over the engine bay on my westy.  BTW the fan on mine runs all the 
time.  That how i can tell i left it switched on.

&gt; What you have is a transformer. Somewhat like a battery charger.
&gt; It is easy to take alternating current and make direct current out of

&gt; It is &quot;relatively&quot; difficult to take direct current and convert it to 
&gt; alternating current of the correct frequency and voltage.
&gt; So no, you can't just run power through it backwards and get house 
&gt; current. I wish we could though...
&gt; A transformer is used to take 110v to 12v. It is also used to go from 
&gt; 12 volts to 110 volts BUT it can not change direct current to 
&gt; alternating current.
&gt; To take low voltage direct current and make higher voltage alternating 
&gt; current you need an inverter.
&gt; I saw a low wattage inverter yesterday (maybe 120 watts, 120 volts) at 
&gt; Lowe's for $45 yesterday - that's enoughto run a TV (better to use a 12 
&gt; volt travel TV), laptop, battery charger for a laptop or camcorder, etc.
&gt; Any accessories that you can buy to run directly on 12 volts would 
&gt; better (more efficient) than doing a bunch of conversions which all 
&gt; have their inefficiencies - generally lost as heat.
&gt; I have a 6 year old 600 Watt Inverter from the &quot;Power to Go&quot; Co. Has 
&gt; been very faithful. Never ran hot enough for the internal fan to come 
&gt; on and it has been roughed around a bit.
