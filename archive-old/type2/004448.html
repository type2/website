In reference to the one gallon can on the driver's side battery tray in the
engine compartment, wouldn't this expose it to too much heat and greatly
increase the risk of fire/explosion?  Does anyone else do this or even
thought of this?

&gt; battery tray strapped in . i would imagine this is an excellent location
but i
