Subject: An engine is born

At precisely 7:03 p.m. central standard time, another upright, air-cooled
VW engine entered the world. Labor was difficult, with the proud father
bathed in gasoline and seething with frustration, but the blessed event
erased all bad memories.

Papa is having a beer. Engine is cooling off.
