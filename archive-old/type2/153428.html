Subject: Reversing exhaust manifolds and bending some exhaust pipe

After checking out Greg Potts Harley pipes welded to reversed exhaust
manifolds, I was actually quite impressed by the simplicity. I live by the
KISS principle.
Greg et al, what do you think of some exhaust pipe bent to fit and Y'd
together. These would then allow an aftermarket 40 dollar muffler from a FLAPS
etc. to sit sideways across the rear of the van just as the stock one does.
I'm thinking replacing a 40 dollar muffler 4 times would still beat the cost
of buying one stock muffler for me up here in Canada. If the pipes were
ceramic coated, they'd last forever.
I am NOT interested in having heater boxes, so that argument is null and
void.
Would love to hear any feedback on this idea, pro or con.

Courtney
