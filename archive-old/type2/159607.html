There are several companies supplying these.  Great Plains Aircraft is 
one good supplier.
The Evans  VP-1  is one of the older designs; a simple single seat 
plywood aircraft which uses a 1600 VW.  http://www.evansair_dot_com/  Plans 
are available.   There are several other aircraft: Sonerai, Cygnet, 
Dragonfly, Kitfox, Hummelbird......

&gt; Hi All, 
&gt;
&gt; Wow.  I would expect the thrust bearings in the crank to beat themselves
&gt; into oblivion in short order.  Then again, the T4 is about as tough as
&gt; boiled owl.  
&gt;
&gt; Does the VW engine have any oiling problems under negative gee
&gt; situations?  Are they using fuel injection or carbs?  Anything special
&gt; they're doing to the carbs to prevent icing?  What about compression
&gt; ratio, hp/torque output?  
&gt;
&gt; What fuel is being used, and what's the consumption rate?  What's the
&gt; overhaul schedule?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
&gt;
&gt; Shad H.

&gt;&gt; The January 2007 edition of Air &amp; Space magazine has a great article on home
&gt;&gt; built Tplanes (under$10,000) with VW engines.  One has a 1.9 that can cruise
&gt;&gt; 400 miles at 130 mph.  Cool pics of the engine with the heads and pushrod
&gt;&gt; tubes visible.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The editor of &quot;Contact&quot; magazine is quoted:  &quot;..the VW conversion engine
&gt;&gt; seems to be the best bang for the buck, mostly because it can go direct
&gt;&gt; drive.&quot;  -the propeller is bolted directly to the crankshaft at turns at the
&gt;&gt; engines RPM.
