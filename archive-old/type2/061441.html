Subject: Re: Questions from a beginner

&gt;Ok, after lurking  for a while now, I'm finaly going to take the plunge and
&gt;ask all you knowlegable people some questions.....
&gt;First, how do I find out how many cc's i have on my engine?
&gt;Second, someone told me it was possible to find out exactly what was wrong
&gt;with my engine (it needs a rebuild) by doing something called a &quot;blow down
&gt;test&quot;. Is this true? Could someone explain the process to me (who is just
&gt;learning)?
Welcome aboard Kerry,
The first thing I would recommend to you is to procure the book &quot;How to keep
your VW Alive&quot; by John Muir.  It's not the be all and end all of repair
manuals but it is definitely the one to get first if you are just starting
out.  Bus Depot or Amazon_dot_com have it, or any big book store. It's a
classic.  The stock motor on your 74 should be a 1700 or 1800cc Type 4 motor
with dual Carburetors.  You can tell for sure by the number stamped on the
motor.  The best test for a sick motor is a compression test.  The guage has
a hose with a threaded fitting that screws into the hole the spark plug
screws into.  You do this for each cylinder by removing each plug and
cranking, not starting, the engine with the guage in place.  The Muir book
has all the details.  Keep in touch.
