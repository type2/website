Subject: welding and gas tank

I have a 71 Westy with rust around the rear wheels. A
guy who welds out of his garage nearby has offered to
patch in some new metal for what seems to be a
reasonable fee. He wants the gas tank out to do the
work. I can see his point — fire, gas, kablooey — but
I wonder if this is the standard procedure. I'm not
aching to pull the engine and tank if it's not
necessary. Opinions? Thanks. Tony Schmitz
