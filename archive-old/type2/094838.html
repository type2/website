Subject: GO ! ! ! (please)

Driving to work this morning, I pulled out of the slow lane (right lane =&gt; 
USA) to pass some normal (60 mph) moving traffic.

OK, I got a grip on myself, remembered I was driving a '78 Westy loaded to 
the gills with things I just have to have with me at all times, and pulled 
(snuck) back into the right (right, as in right/left, not right, as in 
right/wrong)lane.

Question:  does the term 'accelerate' have any reason to be part of my 
vocabulary ??

Barry B
'78 Westy
