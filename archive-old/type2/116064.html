Subject: Re: [T2] Help: Looking for a throttle microswitch for a 1977 VW
  Van

on 10/23/03 09:18, TR Gesell related:

&gt; I looked in Bentley, and it agrees that a true 77 has no microswitch, but a
&gt; late 76 might.
&gt; 
&gt; The old &quot;throttle valve switch&quot; was removed after vin# 226 2077 583, but the
&gt; &quot;microswitch&quot; was used for a short while after that, then it went away
&gt; leaving no electrical switch on the throttle assembly.
&gt; 
&gt; My '77 is CA, and is VIN# 237 2092 XXX, which is well past the cutover. My
&gt; ECU P/N :022-906-021AA



it is difficult with any sort of certainly to specify which years had which
components, especially as CA is different than federal, canadian market
different again.

my '79 CA bus has the throttle microswitch. on a bus with an o2 sensor, the
microswitch removes the o2 sensor input from the ECU so the system goes into
open loop, effectively enriching the mixture. i am not sure how the
microswitch functions to enrich the mixture when there is no o2 sensor, but
i believe it works in concert with the afm circuitry.
