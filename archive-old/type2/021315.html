Subject: How to let a canoe ride atop a bus?
Message-ID: &lt;3B294A8B.18877.B1F480_at_localhost&gt;

I'm looking to buy a canoe (about 16' and 60lbs), and I was 
wondering if those of you with experience in these matters could 
suggest how best to attach it to the top of a bus ('71, no pop-top).  
Do I need a rack (if so, what kind), or can I use a simple tie-down 
kit (foam blocks between the gunwales and the roof and lines 
running from the bow and stern to the bumpers).  I'm hoping for a 
benign and stable relationship between the two vehicles, as well as 
the improved gas mileage promised in the type2 archives!

Thanks much - Dan Sherburne
