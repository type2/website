&gt; I have 71 Westy bought 3 months ago, with new tires on it, 2 people have
&gt; told me that they are an accident waiting to happen.

&gt; 185 70R/14
&gt; Ultra Steal Belt A/S Supreme Sport
&gt; Max load range 1155 lbs _at_ 32 psi
&gt; 2 ply steal , 2 ply polyester
&gt; Sidewalls 2 ply polyester
&gt;
&gt; They drive fine, I've been on the interstate driving to Baton Rouge from
&gt; Houston,  over 2,000 miles on them so far.
&gt;
&gt; Any help would be appreciated, a buddy on mine has the Yoko 356's on his 70
&gt; Westy and loves them.
&gt;
&gt; Should I yank them off?

By all means!  Those tires are way too weak.  You may get away with
driving on them for thousands of miles, then have two failures in 100
miles as I did when I played that game.
