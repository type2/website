&gt; I want to buy a 73 VW van.  The two cylinders on the right don't run, or backfire with flame because they say a gasket is blown.  The left two run fine.  Is it really a gasket that is causing the problem, or is it something major?  They also want $450 for it, is it even worth that much?

VW's don't really have gaskets so that isn't it, but if it runs and the
body is in decent shape it is probably worth $450,  offer them 300 settle
for something in between
