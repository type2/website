Subject: Re: [T2] So Cal body/paint shops

I don't know about ISP West, other than they are a BIG ebay seller (1141
feedback).

Convertible World is down the street from me and I have looked at them for
upholsetery.
They did the upholstery and vert top for a Ghia that was a cover a year or two
ago for either HVW or VWT.  The Ghia belongs to Koch.  The same Koch that does
the steering wheel restoration and other VW restoration work, (I think
Sylmar).  Jamie does EXCELLENT upholstery, carpeting, vert tops.  The quality
is beyond reproach.  As for his full on restorations, I cannot comment beyond
what I would call his sewing work.  It's been over a year since I've dropped by
his shop, so he easily could have expanded his area and picked up a paint/body
area in that time.  Finally, when I get the $$$ together and decide to do the
seats in the DC, Jamie will be the one doing the work.

&gt; Hi there,
&gt;
&gt; Anyone have any comments about either Convertible World in Signal Hill,
&gt; California or ISP West in Carson, California?  I am getting estimates from
&gt; each of them to restore my 72 bus.  Paint, some interior, seals, rust etc.
&gt; They both seem OK, but just wanted to know if anyone has prior knowledge or
&gt; experience with either of them.
&gt;
&gt; thanks in advance,
&gt; Rob, 72 blue bus
