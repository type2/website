Everyone,

Well, Christa and I have to sell Daisy, our 1976 westy deluxe.  We really
don't want to do this, but well, life, you know?  We'll be back with
another in a few years hopefully, but now we'll have to live busless for a
bit.  Sigh...

OK, here's the scoop:

It's a 1976 Westy deluxe (with pop-top, propane, stove, DC fridge, etc).
I've got *loads* of spare / extra parts, many of which I've acquired via
the list-saint Karl von Salzen, who I still owe 5 bucks.  Daisy even has a
propex heater installed.

Daisy's body and frame are exceptionally good rust-wise, as I brought her
up from San Diego a year and a half ago and bought her as a solid bus to
work from to do a completely stock (well, minus the propex heater) resto,
since she'd be eligible for collector car plates in a year and a half from
now.  She's stored in winter.  I sadly now have no time and no money, so
I'll have to let her go and try again another day.

Email if you're interested, and I can send a detailed list of extras etc.

Located on Bowen Island (30 minutes from Downtown Vancouver, B.C.).  $5,000
Canadian funds (which translates to $3,420.91 US dollars as of 3:00 PM Sun
June 13, 1999).

(and yes, I'll still pull over for broken-down buses at the side of the
road...)
