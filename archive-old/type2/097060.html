Subject: RE: Heater Questions

Hi Jay,

I used 2&quot; PVC to replace my long ago rusted out main heat tube.  It never
gave me a headache or anything that would make me think that the poly-vinyls
were off-gassing.  I also installed a 3&quot; bilge blower to give a bit more
flow (also made of PVC).  I live in New Hampshire and it gets pretty cold
here (this morning it was 26*F when I got up).  With the PVC tube and the
bilge blower, I have had plenty of heat, and no more foggy windshields to
contend with.  Now if I could only get my rear defroster to work too...

Here is a crappy photo of my setup:

I have also used a couple of 2&quot; aluminum preheater tubes from my FLAPS to go
from the rear vents (Gretta started life as a deluxe station wagen )through
the front of my rear seat bed base.  I will try to add a photo of this to my
site when I get the time.

If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to ask.  Be sure to
get yourself a carbon monoxide detector before putting an untested heater
back in service.  Any small perforations in the system could leak CO into
your heating air.

Another concept that you might want to explore is using a clear plastic
sheet to divide the front cabin area from the rear cargo area when you are
not carrying passengers.  This way you will be heating the equivalent of a
singlecab instead of a vast cabin full of cold air.
