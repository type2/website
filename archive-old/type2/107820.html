Subject: Re: [T2] felt washer?

They've been included in any gasket kit I've have for an air-cooled Vanagon
engine.  Since the late bays ran similar TypeIV engines they're bound to
have them.  Illustration 13.7 of the Vanagon Bentley shows the &quot;felt ring.&quot;

&gt; &gt;I learned that I need a felt washer when replacing the pilot bearing ..
&gt; where
&gt; &gt;can one acquire this fine obscure item?  and where does it go?
&gt;
&gt; It depends on the vehicle year. Later bays don't have the felt washer.
