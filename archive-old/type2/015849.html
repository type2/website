&gt;	Hey, gang. I've got a 1974 with stock 1800, dual solexes that has
&gt;a farting problem. It farts or pops on deceleration, and pulling the
&gt;cables on cylinders 1 and/or 2 doesn't do much, that is, the engine
&gt;doesn't get nearly as mad as when you pull 3 or 4. The compression's okay

I would bet big money that your right carb's idle volume screw (the one in
the throttle plate) is too far in.  Back it out and with any luck, your
idle will smooth out and speed up, and pulling the plug wires will have the
same result on all cylinders.  If that fails, loosen the idle shutoff
solenoid 1/2 turn (without disconnecting the wire) and see what effect it
has on the idle.  If it speeds up, the solenoid is not functioning.  Your
symptoms are classic idle circuit problem symptoms and should not be serious.
