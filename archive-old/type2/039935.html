Subject: JUNKYARDING

I went out Junkyarding yesterday. I found EIGHT busses in one yard
and SIX more in another yard. They are mostly 70’s and earlier. I’m
going to get the bumpers from a ’72 for my bus at $35 bucks a pop.
Is that a good price?

ALSO, there are several Westy interiors there that I was thinking of
getting at least SOME of the cabinet goodies out of. The problem up
here in the Desert is that everything gets sun rot! Summer temps go well
into the 200 degree range inside a junkyard auto.

Well, first things first. I have to put the air seal in my engine compartment,
and see if that solves my heat problem. Then I need a new tire, and remove
the bush bashers.
BTW, Mike, do you still want them? They are for sale if anybody does want them.
