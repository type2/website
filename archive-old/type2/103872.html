Subject: electrical gremlin

list,

i have an gremlin. not the 70's AMC car...


here is the scenario:

my bus will run with the key taken out of the ignition.

bus is running with the lights on. take the key out and the motor keeps
running. The charging light will now glow very very dimly. Turn off the
lights and the engine stops.

Also, the headlights operate in the parking light position, in other words,
all the lights come on in the first position of the switch. If I put the
switch to parking light position with the engine running - no key - it will
keep running. The switch has to be in the off position for the engine to
stop.

The electrical system of my bus, a '79 westy, is in good to excellent shape,
there are no other problems that I know of. The wiring is good, charging
system works perfectly, never any starting problems. I do have a power wire
to the stereo wired from the hot terminal of the ignition key buzzer relay
so I can listen the stereo with the key in the ignition switch (but in the
off position) as per a tip from another listee. My problem did not
immediately occur after I made that working modification, I don't think so
anyhow.  

I have not tried to troubleshoot this problem very much yet, I am looking
for a good method of doing so. I have pulled the headlight relay, which
makes the problem disappear. Then I can drive as normal but have no high
beams.

Electrical problems are not my forte... any tips appreciated.

Scott Lyons
