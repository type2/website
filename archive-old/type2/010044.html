Mark,

My first bus was a '57 23 window deluxe and I had
grand notions of redoing the interior in wood. I
worked as a painter/wood finisher at the time and
thought I could pull it off reasonably. Unfortunately,
the bus was so rusted out that I couldn't get it done.

One bad thing about wood is that it's pretty heavy.
Also, if you leave it outdoors, it needs re-finishing
every few years. This involves lot's of sanding to
remove the old finish before puttting on a new one.
Marine varnish holds up pretty well (nice gloss if
done right), but it's a bear to remove!!

I *love* the wood emblem idea and I can tell you a
super-easy way to make one (at least in theory;-)...
buy a piece of your favorite hard-wood (I would think
3/8&quot; would work) and a decent router and
template-following bit (these bits have a bearing
attached that follows a template without chewing it
up). Use your metal emblem for a template and go to
town! From there, it's just a matter of finish work
and attaching it.  I've done a lot of work like this
and it really is simple...  I think your biggest
problem would be keeping it from being stolen!!!

Please feel free to post this to the list if you
want...I haven't been able to post anything for a
month now....Come Home, Steve!!!
