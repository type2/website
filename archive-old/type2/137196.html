Subject: OK, I'm absolutely lost on what's wrong with my 70 bug. &gt;:-(

I am so frustrated right now I'd like to burn that f***ing thing.  If you've
followed the thread, I have a fine idle but any load put on the engine, like
driving away leads to stumbling, crapping out, and some backfiring through
the carb. I have replaced EVERYTHING back to the regulator, rebuilt the carb
and it is still the same.



Some clues:



The plugs were very sooty, and the center terminal was eroded on two of them
 I replaced them with new plugs, still runs like crap.



I tried to get a voltage reading on the 15 terminal of the coil and my
digital multimeter just flipped out, and wouldn't read anything, then if I
pulled the neg ground off of it, it would give me a flash reading that was
jumping all over but I did see no's like 13 all the way up to 18, with the
probes not even touching the coil 15 terminal???. It's like there is some
kind of electrical field around the coil area??? My regulator was putting
out a somewhat fluctuating 12.5-14 volts so I think that's fairly normal.



In any case, new points, rotor, cap, plugs, coil, rebuilt carb, still runs
like crap. I am almost certain it is electrical, carb is a simple 28pict,
choke opens fine as it warms up.  I am frustrated, and taking this far too
personal right now, because I'd just like to throw something at the car. I
gotta walk away.



Courtney
