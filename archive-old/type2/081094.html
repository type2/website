Ok, ummm..what seal???  Finally got the throttle body off, which was
filthy, but there was no seal at all !!  Now, from what I have heard I
am supposed to have one.  Should this one be considered special for any
reason?  Got a part number for the seal from another list member.  Do I
go with that?  And does it matter what I clean all this with?  Thanks.
Check the pics at www.wicals_dot_com/troy/vw/images/airleak      Images
compressed this time  :-)  The date thing should be fixed now also.
 
Thanks everyone
 
Troy S. Wical
