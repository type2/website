try the archives and the tests I did between dino and synth oil

conditions were as close to the same as possible to make it without
pulling the engine from the bus.

couple hundred miles same roads, same engine, same outside temps etc, next
day etc.

bottom line, my guages showed NO MEASURABLE DIFFERENCE

I ski andd use syth for the cold start ability, all other things being
equal.
