&gt; - You have to replace the engine every 50,000 miles

This depends on driving style but 50-75,000 miles could be a good 
estimate.

How many miles will you log a year?
Is this going to be your daily driver?

If you're only using it occasionally and for vacations, 50,000 miles is 
a LOOONG time...

&gt; - There are 2 .50 cent gaskets that when they go bad, all the oil leaks
&gt; out quickly.

I have not seen this to be true

&gt; - Throttle linkage gets stuck on full easily.

This is not true.  It may happen if you do not have the return spring 
on the carb throttle, but if that spring is in place I haven't had 
problems with it sticking.

&gt; - Fuel line gets cut by firewall. this one I am aware of, I am 
&gt; wondering
&gt; what the best fix is for it, and can it be done with the engine in.

There is a rubber gasket that sits around the fuel line where it passes 
through the firewall.  If this gasket is in place, the firewall WILL 
NEVER cut through the fuel line.  Last I checked it was $2.50-$4 for 
two of these gaskets.

It can be replaced with the engine in the car.

&gt; - The Skid plate under the front end is impossible to put back in 
&gt; place.

I have not had problems putting the skid plate back into place.  The 
bolts tend to shear off though, so you have to be careful and may have 
to drill them out if this happens.  Not a big deal.

&gt; If anyone can help me cover these points so that I can ease my partners
&gt; mind, I would appreciate it. As I am new to the bus arena, I want to 
&gt; make
&gt; sure I have my facts straight.

Understood.

It's an adventure, but a worthwhile one.  You (and your spouse) will 
need patience though.  That is the nature of buses.

cheers,
      tom
