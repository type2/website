So I wrote:
I used to live in SD, and I recall a few VW resto places: 

The VW Factory (or maybe The Bus Factory, or The VW Bus Factory?) in 
El Cajon. I visited their shop once and talked to one of their guys. 
It seemed like a pretty clean place and they seemed to be doing pretty
good work, although they also seemed to be using a lot of Brazilian
parts instead of paying more for the real German stuff. 
I was told that a lot of their buses sell for around $7000.

Brought Back Bugs, in (east) San Diego. I went to these guys to diagnose
a vexing bus problem once, and they kind of pissed me off and wasted my time/
money. They do restore mostly bugs, but buses too. The place was crowded
with VW's in many states of repair, disrepair. They were too busy to
help me much. Their mechanics told me some things that were true and 
other things that seemed off the wall. I've no idea about their prices.
I saw a bug that had been stripped bare, sandblasted, and repainted real nicely.

Koyle Foreign, 2364 Vineyard Ave., Escondido CA 92029
619-743-1796. I dealt with big John (father) and little John (son). This is 
a pretty clean shop that apprears to do good work. Resto is not their main
thing, but they do some and I saw some nice buses there. They do the engine
work and farm out the body work to neighboring shops. A colleague of mine
bought a gorgeously restored old 22 (or however many) window ragtop splittie
for about $10,000, either from these guys or another Escondido business. I 
think there are more resto places in Escondido. 

Scott's VW Paradise, 1031 Grand Ave. San Marcos, CA 92069. 619-744-9140.
This is mostly a repair shop, but they do buy and sell buses, and probably know
all the resto outfits in north (SD) county and beyond. I never did business here
but found Gary  was very helpful when I was gathering info and shopping for a 
bus myself. 
- ---------------------
Sorry I haven't got more phone numbers, but this should be enough to find them 
through information operators. Bottom line, I think the price rnage you
quoted that guy was low, if you are talking about full on restoration. I'm
sure you could probably get a pretty good condition bus ready to drive for
$4000-$5000 though.
