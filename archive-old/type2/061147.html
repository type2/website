Ian:
Yeah, like just about any other rusted, stuck part- get it red hot with
a propane torch and then work it back and forth with a channellocks (a
better tool yet is a Knipex alligator brand -they have 120 degree vees
in the jaws and work much better on round and hex workpieces). All the
caveats apply: have a fire extinguisher nearby, move all fuel lines out
of the way or work your flame from the other direction, shield all
combustibles nearby with sheet metal or one of those heat sheild
thingies for sweating pipes without burning your house down. I really
prefer to set my cars on fire outdoors. My brother once managed to set
his car on fire while in his attached garage- cost the insurance company
$55,000. Having said that I never am lucky enough to have rusty cars
come apart without a torch. MY experience is that after you get the
parts to move with heat, THEN penetrating oil is good for flushing out
the freed up iron oxide particles, but penetrating oil first is totally
wasted.
