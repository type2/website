Subject: RE: Westy Kitchen Rust Holes

Hi Greg,

&lt;Does anyone have any advice on how to fix these holes without taking out
the entire floor and welding a new one in?&gt;

	This repair sounds like it might be a good candidate for the POR15 Floor
Pan &amp; Trunk Resto Kit.  So far I have been totally happy with all of the
products that I have tried from Restomotive.  They make a very high quality
product at a good price.  While you are there, grab some Marine Clean.  I
tried dozens of different cleaning products to get my seats clean (tan
basket weave vinyl) and found that it is hands down the best cleaner for the
bus interior available.  You can get more info here-
