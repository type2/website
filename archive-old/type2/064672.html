I am getting ready to return my old '77 2L head to Mark Stevens to get
my $85 core charge back.  How does one do this, I am shipping ignorant?

Brett,

I forget what the shipping is but it isn't much via ups. Stephens charges
something like $12 for each crack they weld. My $250 core charge for T-iv
heads was dinged only $12 so I believe them to be fair although it was
roughly a month before Courtney &quot;the core girl&quot; got the credit issued. If
you've got only $85 at stake you may want to count your cracks and check with
ups before committing any time, effort and money to their return.
