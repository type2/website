Subject: Re: [T2] Sink Cabinet Removal

&gt; So I want to pull out the sink cabinet in my non-deluxe 78 westy.

Easier said than done. I'm thinking of taking a sawzall to the floor around it.

&gt;I want to confirm that all joints on the water tank are tight and that 
&gt; there is no leaking anywhere - I also want to check/replace my water pump.

You should be able to do both of these things without removing the cabinet.

&gt; So ... I see two bolts behind the driver's seat ... one bolt going into 
&gt; the floor and one bolt going into the ice box - is that it - or are 
&gt; there more?

I am also removing a 78 westy sink cabinet, for access to the floor.
I found two screws on the fridge side screwed into the sink cabinet.
There is also a small plate holding the bottom spare tire cover.
You will have to disengage the city water connection outside
and the gas supply hose if you have propane. and the water tank drain.

The sink drain presents the biggest problem.
It has been suggested there is a rubber gasket plate under the floor
which will make removal easier, but mine is fitted with a close one, and
the fit is such that the drain will not remove without cutting, as
there is a coupling at the end for a threaded cap. In addition, mine
is blocked with an a/c condenser plate with fans.
If it is such that the drain can be cut in the middle so as to not
show for repair, my cabinet has internal baffling which will have to
come out first, and that is blocked by shelving. Get the picture?
(*reassembly is the reverse of removal:).
