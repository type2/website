Subject: [T2]Cleaning the inside roof of a late model 79 camper poptop.

The inside of my poptop on my 79 camper is rather dirty and has a fuzzy 
material on it how can I clean this without removinag all the fuzzy stuff. 
What is a good cleaner for this. Its like the inside of a vanagon roof.

Casey
