Subject: RE: [T2] seemingly rare issue with vacuum assist brakes on '71
  bus

&gt; As I apply brakes, rpm's rise dramatically.  As a guess, from &gt; 900 to 1500
- 2000.

I have seen this on two of my 71s a few days/weeks before the brake servo
would fail, then pushing on the brake will kill the engine. I don't have a
technical explanation of why it does it.

-Daniel
