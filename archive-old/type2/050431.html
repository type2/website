Subject: RE: [T2] Looking for a Frantz oil filter unit

To the best of my knowledge, these things are not being made anymore. At
least the old style that used a roll of toilet paper. I had one of these on
a 1960 Plymouth Valiant, it looked cool, but it was a major PITA. The thing
was MESSY to change and it took up a lot of space. If you want real good
filtration, get an Oberg, or get an external spin on style(if you have a
type 1-2 upright) and use a Fram HP or K&amp;N high performance filter. These
cost more, but are better filters. My old Frantz went in the trash many
years ago. I am sorry I chucked it now, not that I would use it, but it
would look real cool on the shelf and as a conversation peice.

Does anyone have an unused Frantz oil filter on any of thier parts buses?
I'd 
like to give one of these things a try, but don't want to pay retail :-)
