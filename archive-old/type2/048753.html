Subject: [T2] Re: Needed: Rear Bumper Mounting Bolt Sizes

&gt;My early Christmas present this year was a new rear bumper for my little
&gt;'78 Bus to replace the old one that someone backed into. It should go
&gt;nicely with my new paint job, the only problem is, when the body shop
&gt;took off the bumper, they took a mounting bracket and all of the bolts.
&gt;Now it took me a few months to hunt down all these parts again, but I
&gt;still don't know what size bolts to hang this bumper with.
&gt;
&gt;I need the sizes for both the bumper-to-bracket and bracket-to-Bus
&gt;bolts, if someone could get those for me, that'd be great.


The bracket-to-bus bolts are M10x22mm and have wavy washers under 
them. 

The bumper-to-bracket bolts are the blind chrome 8x15mm bolts with 
wavy washers and M8 nuts, the same as on a '70s Bug with square 
bumpers. 113 707 191 C. I think you need four each.

Hope it helps,

Brian
