Subject: [T2] More cool finds!

		Well I have been looking around a little for a new rear side
closet/cabinet for my 71 Westy. I found Ken Madson at the Bus Co. had a few
of them for $50ea. That sounded good to me. But today I dropped by my
favorite U-Pull auto wreakers and saw a Westy sitting in the yard. It had
the cabinet I needed and it is perfect. It was a 69, so it has a little
different hold down, but it will still work just fine. The asking price for
this lovely unit? $8.50+tax. I snagged it before someone else could. 
		The other cool thing was that this 69 Westy had a 74-79
pop-top on it. They had installed it like normal, but cut out the upper roof
section and left the sunroof pocket. That way they could have a flat bed,
real cool. 
		It also had a weird duct that came out at the bottom of the
back seat on the left hand side. It was about 3in in Dia. And had a neat
steel duct with a flexible duct attached that went back to the engine bay.
At first I got real excited thinking there must be a gas heater back there,
but if there was, it is long gone now. I got the little duct anyway, too
cool to leave behind. 
		And while I was standing there looking at that Bus, I
spotted another Bus,72, in the parking lot. I watched as a guy in a flatbed
wreaker pulled up and started to load it up. I yelled to him and found out
that it is headed to the crusher. I ran out and looked it over. He said he
would drop it off at my house for $100 cash. Too bad I had no cash. The body
was rusty, but the interior was a complete 72 Westy day camper(no pop-top).
It had good bumpers and louvered windows, no engine or trans. It needed too
much to be restored, but had tons of great parts. Too bad, my wife would
frown on another Bus in the yard anyway.
		Anyway, I had a good lunch and got some great part to boot.
