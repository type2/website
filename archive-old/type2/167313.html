Subject: Re: [T2] Finally installing Konis and Hankooks, one question

&gt; Listees, it's been a loooong time since I put the KYBs on  
&gt; &quot;Gottdammerung,&quot; my '74 Riviera, and I'm trying to mount the Koni's  
&gt; I got from Ron.
&gt; But I find the mounting ends of the Koni shocks are wider than the  
&gt; KYBs leaving a shorter length of the lower bolt to fasten the nut.

The Konis are the stock width. The KYBs were too short and required  
spacers.

&gt; Problem is that there seems to be a shoulder on the steering  
&gt; knuckle or lower bolt (or it's a spacer put on when the KYBs were  
&gt; mounted and now rusted in place) decreasing the length of the bolt  
&gt; available for the nut. Anyone have recent exposure to this or know  
&gt; if there is a shoulder on that lower bolt?

Try some penetrating fluid and remove it with the appropriate pliers.
