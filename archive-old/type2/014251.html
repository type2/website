Subject: Re: [T2] Those bleedin' brakes!



&gt;...Every time, no matter what we've tried.
&gt; A big bubble or two comes out every time we open-pump-close-release.

I'm no expert, but what I've always done is:

1.  pump the brake pedal a couple of times, then hold it down with light-moderate pressure
2. open the bleeder on the wheel cylinder and allow the fluid to flow.
3. Close the bleeder valve
4. Release the brake pedal
5. Go back to step 1.

Obviously you need two people to do this.  If your wife is the brake-pumper be very nice to her!

If you release the brake pedal while the bleed valve is open (as in pumping the brakes), you will probably pull air into the system.  Not 
much, but enough to annoy you with small bubbles.
