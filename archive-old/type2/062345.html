Subject:Splittie fever...wtb pre '68 Westy

hey now,

okay, after looking over all your web pages and drooling over your splitties...
it's time for me to buy one. i'd like to buy something that needs a little
work yet is structually sound. somewhere in the southeastern US would be great
but not necessary. any help would be appreciated.

thanks,

jonathan '74 RetroWestie (Ru/\/\ba...a nice loaf but she's just not a splittie)
