Subject: Digital oil temp g. and myriad mods of mine-Everybus..

I have posted to the list about my $10 digital thermometer. Jeff Raven,
did you converse with me about this?  The one with the plug in wire on a
bent probe can indeed be straightened; I tried it.  The dual display
with the alarm is cute but larger than mine (about 1&quot; squ), which I
built in with the oil pressure gauge and a digital voltmeter (email me
for pic).
**For those going to Everybus; if my 234,000 mi engine makes it I will
be there to show this and the following to any interested party:
-enlarged glove box.
-triple bed from 74 put into 78 Westy. Speakers built into armrests,
along with separate radio/cd/cassette, vcr, TV, Sega Dreamcast....
-spare tire cover turned into a cabinet door flush with the storage 
cabinet doors.
-shelf for tv added next to storage pod.
-flip up shelf on the sliding door interior.
-potty disguised as stool with padded cover.
-Opaque 2-sided curtains along with behind front seats curtain.
-Homemade spare tire cover and removable front bike rack.
-rear outside shelf for firewood or generator.
-Front cot turned into a solid bed with foam pad. (retired).
-Extra adult bed that runs along storage cabinet.
-Pod on outside rack for storing camping junk.
-ladder for above that hangs on side.
-outside awning from which a day tent can be hung or the stock Westy 
tent.
-extra 12 v inputs, 50 amp converter to run all the 12v stuff on
housepower (and a 200watt inverter).
-more I'm sure I forgot!
