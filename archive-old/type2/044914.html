Same here in Chicago.
We could all FTD the Flowers to the rest stop or
the funeral.
I think FTD or any other cyber flower shop would
deliver it anywhere you want.

I plan on doing just that in a few weeks when I
drive by there.
Also,
Would somebody who might be in the know please
give me the details on
sending some flowers to the funeral?
Either as part of a group, or the info so that I
might send on my own.
