Subject: Re: safety

What I think is that: If you look for great safety and all the rest, the
little family, the good motel, a good bed, always the good temperature in
your car, never strang smell inside your van, and never have trouble with
the machine, I said forget the old buses.

You have to love risk, aventure and you have to be a little bit fool to buy
a bus. If you are not that, just forget it. But if you love that, you are
gonna see that life taste better with a little bit of aventure and with
risk (Est-ce que ca s'ecrit comme ca le risque????)

Westfalia is not a kind of winnebago. A westfalia isn't a vehicule, you
can't compare (comparer in french...) with other vehicule. Westfalia is
more than a vehicule it's a way of life. And folks, like me, who got just
van between '70 and '79 are as true as before'69 are. A split is more the
great life, more adventure, more every thing, more all.

Don't forget that the only important thing in the life is to be and not to
have. For me (you can have a different opinion than me) It happen very
rarely that I make philosophy in english.

Donc, je vais arreter ici de m'etendre ainsi, car je dois emmerder tous le
monde avec mes phrases anglaises construites avec des mots de 3 lettres.

Bye See you later.
