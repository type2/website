&gt; I am trading out my  rivera top on my bus for a hightop...
&gt;   gotta take a trip to do so and want to leave my now pop top behind to
cut down on weight and also the hassle...of having to pull a trailer to tote
back...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   what can i put safely and leak resistant possibly on the top covering
hole/s until i get to destination....?
&gt;
&gt;   i thought about sheet metal screwing a sheet of plywood down but surely
something else is better....the plywood would get soggy if i hit hard
rain.... i cant afford to loose time sitting under a bridge like i used to
do on my motorcycle i use to ride everywhere before married.
&gt;
&gt;    a sheet of plastic and duct tape would look like a balloon....and might
not last torn by the wind or flying debree ..?
&gt;
&gt;   so what would be a good solution to put over the hole in the top?
&gt;
&gt;   ay ideas without hacking up the bus sheet metal screws will be covered
by the hightop later on.
