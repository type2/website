Subject: ouch and now leaky tranny

My reverse lights went out tonight.  I got stuck in a ditch today. Not just 
stuck, but my front passenger side tire was like a foot off the ground. And 
my frame was resting on a rock on the drivers side. It was scary, thought I 
was gonna flip over.  Any way, We managed to pull it and rock it out.  It 
smelled a little like something had been burning up. Ran ok after I got it 
out though. Then I looked under with a flashlight and saw a bunch of tranny 
oil on the heater boxes. Can't really tell where it's coming fom because my 
tranny is pretty dirty. I', gonna try to fix the leak. should I change the 
tranny fluid after.  Someone told me tonight not to change the tranny oil in 
a tranny once it has over 90,000 miles on it because it has too much wear 
already. Any one else ever heard this? The guy said he used to work at a 
garage. I'm supposed to drive from NC to FL in 2 days.

Thanks for any responses,
Kyle
