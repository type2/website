Subject: Artistic Painting and Servo

Thanks for the info about the servo everyone,
    I've been toying around with this for years and I think it's time to do 
it, Libba has a number of holes in her and I want to let some artists go wild 
at a festival I'll be at in a week......Does anyone know where to get DTM 
paint (Direct to metal) that I can mix up and make my own colors? Or is there 
another paint someone may recomend that is brushable? TIA

    The theme will be music and kids since that's what I do for a 
living..children's musician.

        Andy
