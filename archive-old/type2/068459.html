During one of my phone converstions concerning the Hall Control Unit, 
the person at the shop told me of his bus for sale.  He works at a VW 
specialist part/service place and the phone number is there at work.
Here's all I know:

'63 Westfalia camper, needs RR corner panel replaced (has parts), 
minor FR bumper damage, has a little rocker rust.  Currently has no 
motor, but can put a 1600 together, if needed.
call Brett at Victory Auto, 916-481-9300   $1500 with motor but 
willing to sell without
