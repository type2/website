Subject: 79 rebuilt - Engine power?

Hey guys... a little follow-up after 1700miles road test.

I have a few question about my engine performance!

Ok, i posted about that Bus lately:
http://www.benplace_dot_com/79beige.htm

As i'm over my head with Vanagon problems and i didn't have time to 
carefully study my 79 exhaust configuration and engine condition...

Ok, short story: oil temp very good, oil pressure very good, head temp 
OK... i mean, in betweeen 375 and 420 at 65mph, i did get down 50deg 
after the break-in...
power is...ok, but way less than my trusted 1800cc 73 Bus?????  well, i 
have good power but not enough torque!!!! i can easily reach 70-75mph 
but after that!!! hill!!!! forget about them!!!

I'm using a well jetted Single Weber (for now, i have a set of Kadron on 
the table for later...), but i know that carb... and it's NOT the 
problem, distributor is a an SVDA from AC.NET calibrated for the Weber, 
timing is well set.

here is what i wonder about!!!!
-The stock and very restrictive California exhaust system!!! all 
original with the CAT (emptied)
-AMC head (ridge-step NOT removed) WITH the head gasket ring !!!! deck 
hight!!!!
-the VERY different ratio of the late 091 tranny!!! (i'm loosing 300rpm 
in third and 500 in 4th)
-2 turn IN hydro lifter IN...

Engine compression is around 125-130... pretty good!

I wonder if  it's a mix of all those things???

This week i'm having the &quot;step- ridge&quot; of the AMC head remove (i still 
believe in using the head compression O-Ring)

Sadly i didn 't take time to carefully check the deck hight, i will this 
week!

I also have a set of &quot;heater-box&quot; from a Vanagon AC (non California) 
that i have modified for the 79 heating system... i really don't like 
the VERY retrictive 79 exhaust system. could that explain the slight 
overheat at the heads???? or lower power???

Anyway, i will keep you guys up to date with all those mods but i would 
appreciate some feedback from 79 owners....

So if any of you have to comment on the AMC head step! or change by 
removing the California exhaust system i would appreciate your comments!

Best regards, Ben
