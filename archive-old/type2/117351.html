&gt; &gt; Figure out a way to configure it, so that the alternator can be disengaged
&gt; &gt; from its belt, and use the alternator as a fan motor.  Use a timer so that
&gt; &gt; it doesn't kill the battery.  Possible?  EE's?
&gt; 
&gt; And, of course, this could only possibly work for upright engines...a
&gt; type4 engine has the fan attached to the crankshaft. Might as well just
&gt; crank the starter over for a while. :)

hmmmm, now lets think a bit,  a one way clutch on the type4 fan hub, would
turn by the engine when runninng but freewheel when engine is off, then
put motor where A/C compressor normally sits and use the A/C belt to drive
the fan....sounds like more trouble than it's worth....
