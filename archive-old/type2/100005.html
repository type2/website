&gt; I'm willing to put this to a vote, OFFLIST.  If you have an opinion 
&gt; about
&gt; re-allowing ebay postings to the list, please email your option to
&gt; type2-admin_at_type2_dot_com.  DO NOT post these to the list, nor in a reply 
&gt; to
&gt; this thread.

Another possibility might be to perhaps relax the advertising 
restrictions, but split the advertising off to a third list all of its 
own. This would accommodate both the people who want eBay ads, and the 
people who want no ads at all.
