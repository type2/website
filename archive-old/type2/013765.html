&gt; Ken:
&gt;
&gt; I don't think this made it to the list.  Since I think it will illicit 
&gt; some good responses, can you re-send it to the list?

&gt;&gt; I hope somebody proves me wrong but they are just about impossible to 
&gt;&gt; get. A few years ago VW Bus Heaven had had a run of repops made, I 
&gt;&gt; think they were asking $29.99 EACH for them. Dunno if they sold out.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If I needed some I would probably see a machinist about reproducing 
&gt;&gt; them and make it into a list event.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; (Now watch some listee have a pile for 50c each, oh well, it goes that 
&gt;&gt; way. =^)
&gt;&gt;
