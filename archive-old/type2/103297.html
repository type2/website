Subject: R: [T2] Temp Gauge

Yep! I was thinking the same thing... here in Italy my fellow &quot;busers&quot; know
nothing about all this gauges you americans seem to play with!

I'd love, for instance, to have a RPM gauge, an oil temp gauge or similar...
I do not know how they work actually! Or where I could by one (even in the
USA, and have it sent here to Italy).

Is it hard to install all those things? Do they require that I drill holes
in the engine or similar actions? I don't really have the equipment or the
room to pull the engine... is it something that can be done in a parking
lot?

Peace (and sorry if the question is stupid)
