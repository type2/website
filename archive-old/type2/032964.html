Hello all!!!

 Well I bought a 82 Westy today which is going to force me to sell my 73.
This bus is located in Midwest City, Oklahoma, a suburb of Oklahoma City. 

The Good: New paint job last spring
	   1800 w Weber carb
          NO RUST!!!!
          New Rotor, plug wires, Distributer Cap 
          Tires have less than 10k miles on them
          AM/FM/Cassette player
          New upper Cot
          No cracks on the dashboard

The So-So: Interior is in fair shape
           Seats are in good shape, from a 78
           Window seals could stand to be replaced
           Canvas is good, but the side screens are safty pined, zippers
are broke.
					
The Bad:  No heat
          No Heat
          NO HEAT!! missing the billows that goes from the heat exchanger
to the Y                     tube.
          Need right outer tie rod end, I have the new one, too busy to
install it.
          

 This has been a project for me for the past 3 years, but has always been
used for camping. The motor is strong with unknown milage, the bus has 173K. 

Asking $2500  I can arrange for it to be shipped just about anywhere in the
lower 48 states. p-mail me for more info and pics!!!
