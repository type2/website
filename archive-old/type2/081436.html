Had my ball joints replaced  8/2000 from a VW shop in Portland, Oregon.  =
(Jozsi's Import Car Service)  Ball joints were $120.00, labor was =
$180.00 w/ an additional $45.00 for realignment.  Labor time charged was =
4.0 hours for the job.
In my experience was well worth the price for improvement  (and quiet) =
in ride and the peace of not having to tackle it myself.
