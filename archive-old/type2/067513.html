&gt; A Puzzler that listies will KNOW!  If you didn't catch Car Talk this
&gt; morning, they'll have the Puzzler listed over on http://cartalk_dot_com. 
&gt; 
&gt; So, how many of you know *exactly* which three bolts were involved in the
&gt; flaming demise of a Beetle in this week's Puzzler?
&gt; 
&gt; Although they had their normal disparaging remarks on AC VWs, they did give
&gt; the Muir book some credit with enabling their &quot;mechanically challenged&quot;
&gt; friend to some quite extensive work on the Beetle...
&gt; 

I thought that this puzzler was referring to the guy's friends getting
in the back seat of the bug on their way to a beer fest, and since
the bug owner didn't know that it was important to put the plastic
cover over the hot terminal of the battery, which is under the back
seat, that as soon as someone actually sat there (and nobody had
for the last six weeks since he changed the clutch with the aid of
St. Muir's book), the coils of the seat touched the battery and
torched the poor bug.
