Subject: Timing on re-built engines

&gt; I thought I had a 1700 because it was a 73 and had the engine code for a
&gt; 1700.

I've got an ED engine in a '75 Westy. However, the PO says that it has
been rebuilt and is now a 2L. No receipts, so I can't check.

Here's the question. Do I have to determine what the displacement for
the engine is before I set the timing (as the timing for an ED is
different than the timing for the 2L GD engine) or if the engine number
is ED, I use the ED numbers?
