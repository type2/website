Hello all,

            About six months ago I bought a '71 1600 Transporter, and
have been trying to get it on the road since. I've worked out most of
the problems, but the other day something tragic happened. I was letting
it run to get the gunk out of the gas tank with some treatment and
decided to try to fix a problem I was having with the headlights. I
removed the fuse panel, while it was still running, (I know I shouldn't
of), when all of a sudden it stopped running. The ignition with would
work, and everything else for that matter, except the emergency lights.
Also the warning light, gen and oil, no longer turned on when the key
was turned on. Do you think it could be the voltage regulator?
Everything is still plugged in, as far as I can tell.

Thanks,
Nathaniel Neander
