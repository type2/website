Subject: melted alternator wire

I was driving down the highway when my van ('80 vanagon) lost power and
died.  The battery didn't have enough power to start the van.  I charged the
battery and drove home.  I inspected the alternator wiring and belts and
found that the alternator wire going the the starter had melted.  Three
questions:

What could have caused it?

Also what gauge wire is it so I can replace it?

Finally is the supressor condensor necessary?  My alternator doesn't have
one?

Thanks,

Gary
