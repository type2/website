&gt; &gt; I am facing the same thing.  Since August my bus has been the daily
&gt; &gt; driver, though relief is in sight.
&gt;
&gt; And what's wrong with driving your bus every day?  It likes the attention!

yeah, mine has been my daily driver for over 13 years and almost 200,000
miles.  It likes it.

&gt;   I had a rusty leaky mess of an
&gt; &gt; Eberspracher in mine which was quickly removed.  My questions:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Is this technology safe?  Shutoff switches etc.
&gt;
&gt; If properly maintained, it is safe.  Never heard of a bus catching fire
&gt; because of a gas heater.  All failure modes shut the thing down unless
&gt; some idiot bypasses a safety feature.

yup, I've tried more ways than I can think of to blow mine up
(unintentionally) and it just either ignores me or shuts up....
