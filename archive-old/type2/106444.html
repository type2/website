Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Aftermarkey wheels for a Bay

&gt; The VW mechanic's pocket bible (Without Guesswork) from 1970 lists the 185R14 tires for the passenger Busses but still lists a taller bias ply tire for the working class vehicles. When I researched the tire issue I found that the diameters of these 2 tires are significantly different. But the speedos are the same. So, until VW changed the speedos (I have
&gt; no idea what year that might have been), any Bus with 185R14s on it would read wrong. The radial size closest to the original bias tires is a 205/75 14.

205/75/14 is not what  I would call significantly larger than a 185/14
less than 1 1/2 percent difference in rolling radius from what I see.
