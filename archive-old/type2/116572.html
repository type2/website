--Chris,

I'm throwing your reply to the list, as this is getting beyond my experience level and I don't want to steer you wrong.

From: &quot;Christopher Walker&quot; &lt;toph_at_tophu4u_dot_com&gt;
&gt;I put some oil in the #4 cylinder so see if it would &gt;tell me  valves or ring.
&gt;I did it twice.  First time I put approx 4 drops.  &gt;No change.
&gt;Second time apporx 10 drops.  It held about 10 &gt;pounds more.  Still way out of spec though.
&gt;Should I put more oil in the piston and try it again?

Seems like more oil and try again, since you did get a measureable change. I suggest getting that ring nice and juicey and see what happens.

Either way, it's looking like a head/cyl/valve thing one way or another.

&gt;Either way I need to inspect the cylinder (this is &gt;my assumption.)  What I don't want to happen is &gt;chase after valve or piston problem when it may be
&gt;something else.

Yes, but let's see what the other's say first.

&gt;The only thing it could be is the alignment - right?

You mean valve adjustment? Yeah, I guess if you were way off you'd have low readings like that, but the oil in the cylinder tells a tale to me.

Naturally, get more list advice and double check everything before dropping the engine.

Billy
