&gt; &gt;I have good fuel pressure and spark at every plug.  The AFC unit

&gt; 
&gt; Wow. The exact situation that I am in and I have the same question.
&gt; 
&gt; The ECU is not grounding my injectors and they are not firing. I'm 
&gt; laboriously tracing each wire from the ECU plug, almost none of which 
&gt; agree with the circuit diagram given in Bentley.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope someone chimes in with an experience saying what problem was 
&gt; solved when the ECU was replaced.

it is rarely the ECU that causes the problem, the library has the Bosch
Fuel Injection trouble shooting flow chart, follow this.  I can think of a
dozen things that it &quot;might&quot; be none are the ECU....  

when you checked to see if the injectors had power did you see if it was
being &quot;interupted&quot; which is required for them to inject.  also have you
checked the resistor pack??  how about fuel presure, should hold around
30-35psi if I recall.... my manual is out in the garage so I am going from
memory.   also check ALL of the plugs and hoses.  BTW all 4 injectors fire
together every other revolution of the engine.

good luck
