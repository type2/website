Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS rescue---Engine runs fine, but dies when the 
  engine is  under load.

&amp;gt; I'm a bit confused by this. The coil should not see any more load at
&amp;gt; any time, right? There is nothing to give feedback to the coil that
&amp;gt; says &amp;quot;Scotty, I need more spark&amp;quot;. It always does it's job the same
&amp;gt; way. However could a bad coil cause the spark to become very weak when
&amp;gt; hot? If this is the case, would a visual inspection of the spark be
&amp;gt; possible to see a difference?

coil intermittent when hot ive seen more than once.
and both times didnt think of it myself and had to be reminded to check
it.
