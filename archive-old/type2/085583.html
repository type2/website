Subject: FW: [T2] Acceptable speeds

Hi Volks

I have a 79 Westfakia running with a 73 tranny and 74 engine. With my
previous tires (atrociously under-spec 185/75R14 Daytons)  the speedo always
read about 10% faster than my true speed. Recently I upgraded the tires to a
wonderful set of RT735 185/14 Continentals and the speedo now reads
precisely in tune with my GPS. The GPS is alleged to be accurate within
1/10th MPH. 

I got a set of 5 M+S rated continental RT735's from a jobber unloading a
shipment of NATO surplus gear from Germany. These tires are rated for 1710
lbs per wheel. 2 tires were new, two were lightly used and one was still
good enough for a spare. One of the new ones was on a camo-painted wide-5
rims, the other was on a brand new rim. These have made steering a dream and
highway crosswinds are much easier to deal with.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; 
&gt; Another factor is the accuracy of your speedo and we all know that VW
&gt; speedometers tend to be optomistic as they age.
&gt; 
&gt; My 58MPH figure is actual MPH.  It's more like 70 on the speedo.
