Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust Nuts

Hey Jason,

I am wondering where your originals went to? But at any rate these should be 
threaded studs (not a bolt), tapering I believe from 10mm to 8mm and you 
just need regular M8 (8mm) nuts, but I would get the hardened nuts (usually 
black) and not zinc coated, etc as they will rattle off.

A point of note: sometimes the threads in the heads have been tapped to 12mm 
or so and you need to get a special 12 to 8 tapered stud. Check to make sure 
the 10mm studs runs up properly. Locktite is probably a good idea, as many 
times while trying to remove the heat exchangers the whole stud will pull 
out.

Either I am missing your question or you are looking at the wrong item at 
BusDepot as these wouldn't be sold in packs of 100.

Good luck,

Rob Henley
