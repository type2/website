&gt;I had this half-baked notion that my whole world view could be
&gt;encapsulated in one poignant little slogan

&gt;&quot;ONE MORE MUSICIAN FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY.&quot;

Well, I have the same sentiment but I say it a different way:

&quot;OUR SON IS INMATE OF THE MONTH.&quot;

I think it's very musical.
