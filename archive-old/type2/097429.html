Ralph:

I wouldn't think problems in the aux air regulator would have anything to do
with your problem.

The aux air regulator supplies extra metered air to the engine while the
engine is cold, kind of like you were holding the gas pedal down slightly
with your foot.  After things warm up the aux air regulator shuts off.

The test I've always used is, first, when the engine is stone cold, detach
the hose leading to the aux air regulator at the &quot;S&quot; hose end and blow into
the hose; air should pass freely into the air distribution box.  Re-attach
the hose (not having the hose attached results in a massive air leak and
most engines *won't* run this way) and warm up the engine.  Shut the engine
off and repeat the test; this time you shouldn't be able to blow into the
air distribution box.

The more common cause of gas in the oil is a too-rich situation, frequently
caused by leaking fuel injectors.

&gt;
&gt;  I am still getting gas in the oil. While checking the auxillary air
&gt;  controller, bently says to remove cloth hose from the large rubber S hose
&gt;  and check for vaccum after starting the engine. With the hose removed the
&gt;  engine does not want to start, tries but will not run. Is there another
&gt;  problem causing this or am I doing it wrong. Engine runs fine normally.
