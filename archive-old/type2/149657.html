Subject: Made the 72 bumper fit my 71 

I'd like to thank all the people who sent in some great responses.
Also thanks for the offers to buy the bumper.
Fortunatly I made it work.
I've taken 3 pictures you can see at the link.

I had some old front Karmann Ghia bumper brackets laying around and low and 
behold the two holes lined up with the holes in the bumper.
Now all I had to do was drill 2 more holes 1 1/2 inches towards the middle.
By the way the 72 bumper bumper brackets ended up being 1 1/2 inches further 
out on each side.

The first picture is of the right bracket I made.
The second picture is the bumper bracket installed on the home made left 
bracket.
The last picture is of the bumper on the bus.
I noticed it was a little crooked when I took the picture so I put a thick 
washer under the left bracket and straightened it right out.

The muffler you see on it is an Empi muffler I put on about a year ago as I 
was doing the restoration.
The furthest that muffler has been is around the block.
Van has always been garaged during restoration.
Empi mufflers are junk......period.
Save your money and don't buy one.

Thanks Again
Kevin
