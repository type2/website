Subject: Insurance for Busses

J.C. Taylor offers very low rates for insurance. 1-800-345-8290. I am told
you need to send them a picture of your vehicle and it is supposed to be
kept in a garage. I have not yet called them forthe details but several of
my friends have insured through them with good results.
