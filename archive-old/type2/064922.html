&gt; &gt; hey an answer would be great
&gt; &gt; my horn is disconnected and if I connect the horn it comes on at random
&gt; &gt; intervals
&gt; &gt; I have been tempted to do what yoour PO did and rewire the horn withan
&gt; &gt; external button.

&gt; My experiance has been that the wire inside the sterring Column rubs raw
&gt; so all the insulation is worn of the wire ...
&gt; When you make a turn the wire moves inside the stering column and grounds out
&gt; causing the horn to go off.  THats what happened to mine, i just unhooked
&gt; the horn because its a pain in the butt to replace the wire ....
&gt;
And for still another experience (of intermittentant horn honking): keys
swinging beneath the ignition key wore through the paint on the steering
column, eventually grounding the column back through the ignition switch.
It would honk on right turns on the highway, and on the *really* rough dirt
road to the house from the blacktop. Finally noticed the spark one evening.
&quot;Fixed&quot; by placing a (slit) 12 inch long piece of poly pipe around the
steering column. Electrical tape would have worked.

So would switching to something other than a conductive key ring setup.  %^)
