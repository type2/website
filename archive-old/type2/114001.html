&gt;I live in florida and was wondering how do you become a mechanic that works
&gt;on old vws and get paid to do it.

First off, I know this has minimal bus content, but if it gets another 
qualified VW mechanic out there, it will help us all in the long run.

I don't know where in Florida you are, but here are some programs that you 
could check into

That's just a FEW of the community college programs in Florida.
You could
1. Get yourself enrolled into a program that is near your home.
2. Start pounding the streets looking for someone who will let you slave 
while you learn (minimum wage)
3. Talk to your instructors about who is looking for employees.

One of the best things about working in the field while you are studying in 
that same field, is that it always seems like the day after you have a 
lecture, you come across the very problem you discussed in class the day 
before.  &quot;WOW, I know what that is, we just talked about this 
yesterday&quot;.  I get my students telling me that very comment on a regular basis.

The last one came in the week before school was out all excited, he had 
just gone in an taken a test with the local power utility (electrician) and 
scored second in the pool.  Most of the test was on the topics that we had 
just completed covering.

The school will teach you the basics of internal combustion engines, 
transmissions and other systems.  The specifics to air cooled or other 
engines, you can fill in with OJT (on-the-Job-Training).

If you are currently employed and looking for a career change, this is 
still the way to go as most colleges have night programs for working students.

Good Luck
