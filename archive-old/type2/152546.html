Subject: Re: [T2] New brake woes

How many bleeding screws on your calipers ?  Are you always using the
screw that is at the top of the caliper ? The one at the bottom won't
do. If there is only one at the bottom, you've got the wrong caliper.

Otherwise bleed more.

Brake reservoir is still full ? If it goes empty or close while you
(power) bleed the brakes, air can get in and all your efforts are
vain.

I don't know how power bleeder works so can't help with that. Bleeding
the good old fashion way has two advantages
1) it makes you meet your neighbor or makes the kid feel important
2) you know exactly what is going on
