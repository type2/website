Subject: Re: [T2] upgrading to 73+ brakes?

I have done this.  There is a post in the archives where I list this process
in detail.  Please consult that, I am working from memory.

As a result of paying some jackleg to replace my ball joints, I ended up
with this job 1/2 done, without knowing it.  When I realized something was
up, I found out that the rotors were shot so I ordered rotors, never mind
the calipers.  No fit, I then realized that the calipers were not the ones
that I rebuilt.  I ordered '71-'72 calipers, no fit.  Only if I used the
really thin trash rotors would everything work.  I then realized that I must
have '73 steering knuckle and calipers.  I ordered '73+ rotors and
everything fit just fine, except the backing plate.  I replaced them,
rebuilt the calipers, and all was well, and has been 2 years+ now.

The summary to this story is:

1. Beware jackleg mechanics.
2. Replace backing plate
3. Replace steering knuckle
4. Replace calipers.
5. Replace rotor
6. Remember 1. above.

The spindle is the same, as far as I could ascertain as well as the '72
booster.

I am glad now to be upgraded, I hated jerking around our vendors by ordering
the wrong stuff, being frustrated (I always try to be very polite - even
when frustrated), returning things.  I wish that I had been told what was
done.  I stupidly trusted; nunca mas.

Hope that helps!
