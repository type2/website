Hear Ye, Hear Ye!!!  Come one and come all to the first ever Tidewater Type 2
auction page.

All At the Tidewater Type 2 bus camp out called &quot;Bus Fandango&quot; a gentleman
approached me.  He asked if  Tidewater Type II Bus Club ever did charity
events.  I told him we could.  He told me to hold on and came back with two
tool kits.  He asked me to sell them and give the proceeds to charity.

After trying to decide the best way to go about this, I have decided to hold a
silent auction.  The auction will run from Wednesday, July 25th to Wednesday,
August 8th, 2007 and will be held over the internet.  You may bid via e-mail
by responding to the link provided on the page.  -Your bid will be
confidential until at which time the auction has expired.  At that time it
will be announced who the high bidder is along with the bid amount.  Payment
will be expected within five days after the close of the auction at which time
you can pick up the tool set.  There will be two auctions being held
simultaneously.  Simply click on the link button to e-mail your bid.  Please
make sure that your subject line correctly reads the item you are placing the
bid for.

After the auction is held and we determine how much money was raised,
Tidewater Type 2 will divvy up the proceeds between the Type 2 list, Full Moon
Bus club, and a charity that the club votes on once we see how much moolah we
are dealing with.

Happy bidding, and if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call.
The -articles will be available for viewing by calling Ian at 757-469-3527.
