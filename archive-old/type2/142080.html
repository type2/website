Subject: Re: [T2] oh my gosh my locks work!

I've got an engine lock that has the 3-screw type.  I need a lock that
has ONE screw. Oops! I was told it would fit 68-71 (my bus is 69) but
when got it, I found my bus has 1 screw hole, not 3. So, either I've got
the wrong engine door, or something funny is up. Ideas?

&gt; Hi Tim,
&gt; sorry for the delay.  I was looking into the 3 hole thing.  I can't
&gt; find a 3 hole bus or latch anywhere.  Where'd you get it?

&gt; I need a one hole so no go for me...but, I'd like to resolve this
&gt; mystery.  hhmm..... maybe ask the list.  I'm sure Karl knows.

Good question. I bought it off this list a while back. The seller said
it was for my bus year. Bought it without checking 1 vs. 3 holes.
Assumed age was only thing that mattered until it arrived &amp; no go. Ok.
