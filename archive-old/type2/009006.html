You have the typical &quot;wiring loses current carrying capacity&quot; syndrome as c
ontacts get old.....  On my 71 bus years ago I was poor and soldered a long
piece of house wire (12 gauge) to this upper sol. terminal and ran it thru
the engine wall to sit by the battery + terminal (wrapped the end around
the cable so it couldn't touch anything)....To start, I had to turn on the
ign, ran back and touched the battery +....great way to do a one man
compression test also!   Nowadays one uses a starter relay -Any FLAPS has a
starter relay- (for a Ford, I think) -hook up your red wire from the ign
(don't use the fuel pump wire!) to the primary side of the relay, which
must be grounded. (I drilled a hole and mounted it to the body wall that is
also the wall the seatbelts are mounted to).  The secondary side of the
relay (it closes like a switch) gets its own wire from the battery terminal
on the starter and shunts it right to the solenoid when you use the
starter.   Problem solved, unless the contacts in the ign switch are
dropping out.
