&gt; two different ways to different results.  the long screw that is a
&gt; throttle stop is just that, it stops the throttle from over closing. 
&gt; making it close flat or flush, whatever you want to call it.  if it is
&gt; propped open to increase the idle then you are bypassing the idle
&gt; circiut in the carb and making in idle faster by using part of the
&gt; progression circuit.  hope that makes sense.  anyone else with me on
&gt; this on??? 

--&gt;  Let me clarify...the carburators I'm using, Weber 34ICTs, have the
throttle stop as the only method of adjusting idle speed.  Other
carburators allow the throttle to close flush, and bypass air around it
for idling.  I'm wondering what the advantages of this approach are, or if
there are none and it's just a different method?
