Hi William
I did my 1600 75 DP recently and it is straight forward. I can recommend doing
it asap. I had put a grommet where it goes thro’ the bulkhead but noticed when
I replaced the line that the steel pipe had been cut into by the metal. I
replaced the steel line - in fact I got one from a secondhand parts dealer and
that too was damaged, so got one made up new by a specialist pipe firm. I used
the proper VW fuel hose.
I worked in the open. not the garage for obvious reasons. First drain the
petrol- I did this when cold and from the engine bay by disconnecting a line
to the pump and draining to a plastic container- try and do when not much
petrol to drain !!.. it goes w/o saying that you must take ALL precautions
when dealing with petrol .. gloves etc. Make sure the tank is empty. Probably
a good idea to disconnect battery before you start --
Then if you get underneath and follow the line, it goes to the bottom of the
fuel tank and should be fitted with a hose clip. You do not have to remove the
tank on an european type 2/T2. Remove the clip and the hose pulls off. On mine
it was also connected to the underside metal with plastic clips as it fed down
to the metal pipe through the bulkhead and into the engine compartment. I took
all the line out and replaced. I made the Hoover bulkhead fitting from brass
lamp parts and that seems fine- no movement of the pipe now. 
I was told it was best to use  pipe clips rather than jubilee- as these can
cut into the line- the proper clips give a smooth surface to the line. I used
clips on all the connections (although there were none on some, eg. where it
connected to the steel pipe through the bulk head).
I think George said he replaced his line every 2-3 years... so may be a fairly
regular job... but better safe than sorry. Let me know if you want further
info’
