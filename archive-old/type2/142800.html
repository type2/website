Subject: Re: [T2] Aftermath: No power

Found the problem.

The nut had come off the back of the lever for the fast idle cam. That
kicked the choke half closed. Of course that bastage can't be put back
on without disassembling the carb. Grrr...

Take the top off the carb. Get gasket from second rebuild kit. Take
choke housing off. Put choke housing on from other carb. Reassemble.

While I was pulling the balance tube off the whole brass tube popped
out of the carb! Crap! Put it back in with some silicone to seal it.

Since I was geared up for it (grubby clothes) I decided to check the
valves anyway. Exhaust for #1 was a bit tight. I also discovered that
I think I've been adjusting the valves too loosely. I'd been adjusting
until the feeler can just slide through. But I was pushing on the
screw with the screwdriver. Gads. Even Muir's book talks about that!
Readjusted all the valves with the rockers pushed at the rod end with
my 3rd hand (heh).

I never realized just how quiet my bus could be! I thought that valve
noise was normal all this time!

Took the bus for a freeway run. 70mph against a 30-40mph headwind! The
GWB hasn't hit 70 that easily since I left California! Woot!

Time to eat something. Haven't had anything but a piece of cake all day...
