Subject: Poking around behind the Dash
...
Now, the flashers won't flash and the turn signals have no blink.
Headlights work.  They were working fine before.  I checked all fuses
and even started the bus up.  The flashers make a &quot;clunk&quot; sound but
won't flash.
Did I knock off a plug or pull a wire somewhere back there?
Thanks for any info.

Pete,
I would check the fuses, first, the grounds second and make sure that 
they are all hooked up, then go one by one over the connections on the 
back of the dash.

This leads to a question I've always had.  Has anyone make a computer 
type plug for old bay windows dashes, something we can hook up so we 
would only have to undo one bug plug?  It drives me crazy to have to 
pull all the little spade plugs in the back of the dash.
