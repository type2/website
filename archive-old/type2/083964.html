Subject: Re: [T2] horn and brake lights are linked

I've been having problems with my brake lights blowing a fuse periodically
for the last year on my 76 westy.  I've looked and looked.  The PO put in
an under-dash button switch for the horn and re-wired the circuit.  I know
there are some original wires _at_ the horn itself that are loose and
disconnected.  Maybe even some under dash.  I guess that could account for
the periodic blown fuse, (hit a bump, make contact, pow!)  I'll have to
check to see if the wires are hot.  I'll get back to y'all.

&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; To fix the problem, I traced the wiring and found that
&gt; &gt; the 12 volts that feeds the brake light switch on the
&gt; &gt; master cylinder is the same 12 volts that powers the
&gt; &gt; horn.
