&gt;i have resigned myself to at least taking off the head to check the
&gt;wrist pin and rod bearing.

You will have to take off more than the head.  You'll have to remove the
piston and liner also.

&gt;question:  is it worth it to try to take off the head with the engine in
&gt;the van?  i really dont want to get into taking out the engine by
&gt;myself.

Okay, reality check time.  A type IV VW engine is an inanimate bunch of
metal parts weighing about 150 lbs.  You are a highly intelligent,
reasoning human being with tools to assist you.  You probably weigh as much
or more as the engine.  Don't let it intimidate you.  Humans have traveled
to the moon and you can R&amp;R a type IV engine.  &quot;Not wanting do it by
myself&quot; is not a good reason to not drop the engine in my book, unless you
are handicapped in some way.  Now that I've said that, I used to feel the
same way back when I first got my bus, and I discovered that it is possible
to remove the heads, pistons, and cylinders with the engine in the bus.
However, it's hard to keep everything clean, and it's about the same amount
of work either way.  With the engine in the bus, you have to remove ALL of
the tin, the fan housing, fan, carbs, intakes, oil filler neck, alternator,
exhaust, etc..  I would STRONGLY recommend not pulling the pistons out of
the liners.  If you do, it will be hell getting them back in underneath the
bus without breaking a ring.  The other way to do it is to pull the
cylinder off until the pin is just fully exposed and remove the pin.  This
won't be easy either.  On the drivers side, you either have to push the
number three pin forward, or the number 4 pin backward.  The oil cooler
bosses prevent the latter, and the transmission bellhousing gets in your
way on the former.  I ground a small notch in my bellhousing.  Wish I
hadn't.  Should have just pulled the engine.

&gt;if there is a blocked oil passage, can i clean it reliably without
&gt;splitting the case?  of course i  would like to avoid this if at all
&gt;possible.

If there is a blocked passage, you probably can't clear it without
splitting the case, because it's probably in the crank.  Wait, what am I
saying?  If there is metal in the oil, you are going to HAVE to split the
case and clean everything out, or live in fear until your engine dies
again.  Pull the engine, split the case, and do what needs to be done.

&gt;my main concern is preventing this from happening again.  i would hate
&gt;to replace the rod/wrist pin bearing and then do it all over again in
&gt;another 10k miles.

Who wouldn't?  When I installed my engine after rebuilding it myself for
the first time, I took it on a drive down the freeway and within minutes
the oil pressure was down to 25 psi.  I felt this wasn't normal and was
afraid I had screwed up the bearing clearances.  Turns out the cooling
flaps had just stuck shut, but I pulled the engine back out (by myself, get
a decent jack and you can too), split the case, and remeasured the bearings
before I found that out.  Took me an extra day.  Pissed me off at the time,
but doesn't bother me now.  Chalked it up to a learning experience, as
usual.
