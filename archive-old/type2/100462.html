Subject: Re: [T2] so, if I am testing for shorts, what am I doing wrong?

Chris

Good point. I made the same suggestion in a follow up p-mail. I recommended 
measuring the voltage across the bulb. If it is 6 volts or less its safe to 
use his ammeter.

&gt;
&gt;If the bulb is bright, big load, if the bulb doesn't light or is very dim 
&gt;you might be okay testing it with the meter.
