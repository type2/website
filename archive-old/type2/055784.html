I've been looking at various pictures
of early splits on the web, and have noticed
a couple that have no visible turn signals.

I have also seen busses with what appears to
be a turn signal lamp housed within the regular
headlight housing.  One person I talked to got
fed up with not finding parts, so welded holes
up and installed turns within headlights.

Did some early busses have NO separate turn
signals, and only the had contained-within-the headlight
version?  Or are ALL busses with missing turn
signals a customized feature?

Found an early split FS, no text,  just a photo and an
email address.  Photo shows a corner window Deluxe, 
with no turnsignals up front, so dating is difficult,
other than pre '64.  Have sent email, but no reply yet.

if there were no turn signal bits on the front of the bus, odds are that it is
a semaphore bus- barndoor or up to 60 euro version.  

The little bulb in the headlight housing is a driving light- comes on when the
knob is pulled out half way (if it is working correctly- mine doesn't, but
part of my wiring is messed up) .  If they are rigged as turn signals that is
a custom dealie.

another dating hint- if the top cargo door hinge is just above the belt line,
it is mid 61 or later.  If it is halfway between the beltline and the roof, it
is early 61 or earlier.
