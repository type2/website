&gt; I think way too many people see the AIRS list as just something to be used

well really the only reason I carry it, don't want to be a &quot;bother&quot; , that
said since she came by my house on the Interstate I am sure she had my
listing with her.... not that I know squat about carbs, but she could have
called, she didn't but she could have

&gt; the traveling VW driver.

the devil is in the details, if any of us would have guessed she would
have had 50 VW vans around her at the time....

&gt; would really like to entertain this issue and discuss a &quot;host member camping
&gt; list&quot; for even travelers who aren't having problems with their busses.

well considering I have to leave my van barely off the road, doubt if I
could offer any spot other than a lets' work on it for a few hours.  

But.

&gt; Whatta ya say Wade?  Do we make a list of &quot;Campsite Driveways&quot; or simply
&gt; state it more strongly in the FAQ?

how about someone (like myself) who will keep a list of parks, Wal Marts
truck stops and other more or less secure local places where you stand a
good chance of not being molested in their local area??

&gt; Are any of you interested in signing in on that separate site?

no keep it on the main list
&gt; 
&gt; Is it necessary?  

???

&gt; I would like to suggest that we place a dedication to Kristen Laurite on the
&gt; A.I.R.S. site.  She deserves it if anyone does.  We helped her all we could
&gt; and I truly don't see how we could have done anymore.

count, me in for a few bucks for a memorial, or flowers.....maybe the next
person or persons to go by that rest area could put something at her last
spot on this earth.

&gt; I wish I could have been there for her in the end, but some things have to

I think anyone on this list would have driven to ARK immediately if we
even suspected something would happen...

&gt; happen the way they happen.  We learn from the tragedy and try to be
&gt; proactive so they don't happen again.

the key to the whole thing, those who ignore the past are destined to
repeat it..
