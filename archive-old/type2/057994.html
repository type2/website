Hey all. Guess I'll throw my 2 cents into the discussion. BTDC=Before
top dead center, ATDC=After top dead center. Top dead center meaning as
far as the piston can travel on it's upward stroke. BTW everything that
follows is for an upright engine. I have no experience with pancake
engines but this would probably work on one. Also, leave the ignition
off.

OK, pull your distributor cap off and line up everything so that your
number one cylinder is at or near top dead center. Next, pull the spark
plug out of your number one cylinder. Go cut a 6 (or close to it) inch
piece out of the straight part of a coathanger and bend one end into a
loop small enough to go into the spark plug hole. This will keep you
from accidentally poking a hole in one of your piston rings with the
coathanger.

 Insert it into the hole until it won't go any further, don't force it
though. Keep enough pressure on it to keep it in contact with the top of
the cylinder during the whole experiment.

Okay. While hanging onto the coathanger, turn your engine
counterclockwise about an 1/8th to a 1/4 of a turn. Feel the coathanger
go down into the cylinder? Now, turn it back clockwise and the
coathanger should rise out of the spark plug hole. What you are feeling
is the piston moving up inside the barrel towards the cylinder head.
This is BTDC and your pulley notch should be to the left of the split in
the case. When you get to TDC, the piston has gone upwards as far as it
can and now has nowhere to go but down. Your pulley notch should be even
with the middle of the case at this point. Keep turning the crankshaft
clockwise a little bit and the piece of coathanger should sink back into
the spark plug hole. This is ATDC and the pulley notch should be to the
right of the case split.

Jeez, sorry to be so long-winded but this is how my VW guru finally got
me to understand the concept. Hope this helps.
