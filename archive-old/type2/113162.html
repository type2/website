Subject: Re: [T2] disintegrated pilot bearing

It you 'accidentally' destroy most of the race to a point that just
the shell is left. There is hope. I used a small grinding stone 
attached to a drill. Grind the race down till its paper thin, then
tape it with the chisel. Be careful not to get carried away while 
grinding.

Their is also a neat little procedure where you put oil soaked paper
towels into the crankshaft pilot bearing recess. I think you then
use a wooden dowel and tap it into the recess. The paper towels 
expands outward when you hammer on them with the dowel, thus pushing
the bearing out. Check the type2 archives on this, that's where I
first read about it. Good luck.

Alex
