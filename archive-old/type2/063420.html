Subject: engine conversion

Hello

     My dad has decided to just make his own tin to go around the void left
by removing the FI engine. I took out all the fuel injetion componets and
saved them for possible reuse someday and put a voltage regulator in. We
have the engine in now and the westy is now driveable. I know this is a bus
list but i also have a 71 super beelte and around 40-45 mph the steering
wheel starts shaking. I have replace the steering stabilizer, &amp; passenger
side ball joint all which were worn out. I was told by someone that if the
car was out of alignment it could cause this problem and was wondering if
anyone else out there knew anything about it. One last thing is does anyone
know a place the sells a nice selection of replacement panels for the 68 and
later busses my heater tube is gone and some other places are in bad shape.
I love my bus and would like to restore it one day and i would like to have
something left to restore.

Thank YOu
Phil Burton
