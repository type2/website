Subject: Re: [T2] Throttle Positioner sought

&gt;  Sorry to say but a throttle positioner will not work on that carb. I sell those carbs for 150 dollars. They are made in 
&gt;China under licenese from Peirberg. but so far have been very good. I have found that on a 1600 they need a bigger 
&gt;pilot/idle jet as they run a little lean at idle and will have a little hesitation when the choke turns off.

Hi Ronnie,

I do notice some hesitation. Do you sell the jet you recommend for this 
carb for use on a 1600? How much for the larger pilot/idle jet? And do 
we need installation instructions or can this bozo driving this bus 
figure it out for himself?
