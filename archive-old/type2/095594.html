Subject: RE: [T2] Adding Oxygen Sensor.

&gt; One thing you might consider if you're going to the trouble of
&gt; welding in a bung for the O2 sensor is just monitoring its
&gt;  output yourself, in the cab.


Actually there would be a way to add an 02 sensor to a 49-state Vanagon (or
late bus) exhaust without having to weld in a fitting. Since you are
replacing your parts anyway, you could order a watercooled Vanagon cat
converter and a 1.9 liter ('83-85) watercooled Vanagon muffler, in place of
the aircooled ones. These would bolt right up to the stock late bus or
Vanagon crossover pipe and look the same cosmetically, but that cat has a
built in port for an 02 sensor.  In fact I could &quot;custom ship&quot; you an
aircooled Vanagon exhaust system with these substitutions for maybe $10 more
than the price of the stock aircooled system.  If the 02 sensor didn't work
out, you could simply remove it (the cat even comes with a plug to fill the
hole if you're not using an 02 sensor) and you're back to a 49 state setup.

Now, with regard to whether the 49 state ECU would work with an 02 sensor,
that I don't know.  I've never heard of anyone doing it, but that doesn't
mean it can't be done.  (The California setup, of course, does use an 02
sensor, but also a different ECU.)
