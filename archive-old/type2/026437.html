Subject: Glass removal and a new jack.
Date: Thu, 24 Aug 2000 13:18:04 +0100


I've read instructions on getting glass into the windows of a van (1/4'
rope, 2 people etc) but don't recall reading how you get a window OUT in one
piece.

Sitting in my &quot;to do&quot; pile is a new sliding window unit bought from VW
Heritage. It is a quality item (proper VW part from Brazil) with a nice
catch and a good aluminium frame. The man on the phone said it used the
standard window rubber and since mine are less than a year old they should
be all right. All I need to do is fit it, preferably keeping the plain glass
as a spare.

Can anyone suggest a method  of removing the old glass ?

Also, I ordered a new jack from Just Kampers and it arrived last night. It
doesn't look like the one in the catalogue being a sort of scissor jack that
fits the jacking points. It is very effective though with a reasonable size
foot that didn't dig into the soft tarmac on our drive, although a board for
use on mud is a must. Plenty of lift available - I changed the back tyre an
still had 2-3 inches to spare with the tyre clear of the ground by 1/2'.
Claims to be genuine VW but is Brazilian with no VW logos. I suspect it is
the one supplied with new type 2's. I'm pleased with it anyway (no FART's on
why a bottle or trolley jack is better please !) as it will hide in the van
nicely and is easy to use, very little effort required to lift the van.
