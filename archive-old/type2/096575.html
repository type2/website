Subject: Restoration Info/Help(longish)

I am once again thinking about tearing my bus a part and putting it back 
together.  This is going to be a large and complicated project.   I 
want to come up with some sort of plan.  Having never taken this kind of 
project on before so I really don't know where to start.

I already have all the various repair manual and think I can fix or get 
fixed just about anything.  I also have almost all of the original 
documentation for the camper and accessories.  I already do much of my own 
mechanical work for all my cars and motorcycles, even the new ones.

Can you guys suggest a place or have a good road map for beginner 
restoration?

Has any one used this book with 1968+ bus or have an opinion about such 
things.
Vw Beetle &amp; Transporter : Guide to Purchase &amp; D.I.Y. Restoration (Foulis 
Motoring Book) (Reissue ed)

Bus Info
1973 Transporter, Safare Custom Deluxe Camper(High Top) #356, Dual 
Battery, 12/110 Fridge, Propane stove &amp; heater, pdp(?) in dash A/C, 1800 w/Webber 
Progressive.

Engine is still strong and original but needs carb tuning.  I still have 
not found information on which dist to use and how it should be connected 
with this application.  I think I want to keep the Webber.

A/C is not hooked up. Someday I will try it and consider getting it 
working.

Body has an old repaint with the wrong colors.  Some rust in the rocks and 
window, but mostly clean and straight.  Needs batter trays and other 
assorted floor patches.

Camper most of the paneling needs to be redone due to leaking upper 
window seals and poor drainage.  I will also redo the table and counter 
tops as the particle board is starting to shed/expand.  Pluming need to 
be gone through to fix the leaks and replace the tank.  Need to replace 
vinyl floor.  Vernal cushions and covers need to be replaced. Propane stuff 
is in excellent conditions.  Fridge works great.

Electrically sound but needs second battery and the parts to hook it up.

Restoration Goals.
I want a nice mostly correct bus that looks and drives well.  While it 
won't be a daily driver I expect to camp in it, run errands and go to the 
occasional show.

Limits
Time and Money, while not limit less I want to do things right.

Finnally, I am looking for some history on the Company that did the 
conversion.  I already have quite a bit on the campers them selves thanks 
to David and Bluto, but don't know much about the company.

Thanks
Steve
