&gt; &gt;&gt;Is it possible to just order JUST a friction plate,
&gt; &gt;&gt;as opposed to being required to buy an entire clutch assembly?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;or am I being penny foolish ?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Sure it's possible, and I don't think you are being penny foolish.  Others
&gt; &gt;will probably disagree but I don't normally replace parts that aren't broken.

&gt; Bus Depot does not sell JUST the friction plate.
&gt;
&gt; Who does?

Your local FLAPS.  It's a very common part.
