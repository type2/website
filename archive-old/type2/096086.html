&gt; I cant figure out how to get this Accelerator cable to come off me 

it's a real dog.

&gt; Automatic Transmission linkage... Its stuck on there, it looks like a

&gt; that slides on to a post.... but something is holding it on. and I'm

that is exactly what it is.

&gt; not sure
&gt; what it is.  I've sprayed it to death with wd-40, I used to whole 
&gt; can over 
&gt; a period of a week.... I heard that if you are not too careful that you can 
&gt; actually break the linkage and you have to remove the tranny to fix 
&gt; that....... 

yes if you break it you really are &quot;scr*wed&quot; ask me how I know.

ok,  is the cup loose on the post??  can you move it up and down ??

first get it loose if it is not.  

the cup has two spring wires on either side these are what hold it on,
they are inside and can't be seen.

I have used a pair of needle nose pliers that have a taper to the point.
and use them like wedges on either side, you must evenly apply presure to
both sides at the same time

                                   _
                                 / O \
                                 \ | /
                      here-----&gt; __|__ &lt;----- and here
                                

make sure it is real loose before you try it is on REAL tight.


good luck
