&quot;It will either be a stock 1800 engine or a 1900 engine (1800 with 96mm
cylinders - this is what was on my Safare when I bought it).  Type IV style
pancake engine with dual Solex carbs.  If it's an automatic, it might be
fuel injected, but those are pretty rare in that year.&quot;
         

    From what I hear, 1974 had 1700 engines. I have a dual carbed 1700 engine with an automatic tranny. This setup is completely bone stock!!!
