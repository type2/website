Subject: guy looking for vanagon

A guy stopped me on the street today looking for a vanagon in the
southeast. He was trying to spend 2500-3000 clams.
Didnt seem to have a preferance of either interior or engine but when he
heard they made a diesel he was interested. He said he previously owned a
79 which burned up. doh!
Any leads in the southeast please send them to me.
thanks
