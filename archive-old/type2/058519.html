Subject: Trouble starting hot engine
Content-Disposition: inline

Message text written by Pat Steppic
&gt;Anyone else see this?  If so, are there any other trouble spots
I should examine?  One thought I had was that the engine might 
be running a little hot.  One thing I've never been able to 
figure out is how to determine engine temp - I suppose you can 
tell if the thermostat is opening the vents, but how to 
determine that the thermostat is opening at the correct temps?

Hey Pat,
        First of all, I dont see how you can stand not having an oil temp
gauge.  They are a key element to getting miles out of a Vw....especially
an old worn out ones like mine.

        And yea, my '69 did the same thing as yours until I replaced the
hoses and filter.  I had a hard time believing that would fix it, too, but
it did.  Another thing I do is...if I have to stop on a long trip, I put
fresh (cool) gas in it....even if I dont need it...or I just leave it
running.  You'd be surprised what you learn about aircooling if you had a
temp gauge.
