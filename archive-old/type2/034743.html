Subject: my clutch died today.

i have a 72 westy and the other day my clutch gave out, it was slowly
getting progressively worse and right now, the pedle dosent return all
the way, and when its to the floor it feels like its still half engaged.
is the the clutch cable streaching? or did my clutch just die? or is it
new tranny time, shifting has been kinda hard recently..
