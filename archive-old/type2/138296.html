&gt; Not an answer to the exact question, but my '79 bus had AC and the

&gt; being
&gt; at the junkyard and the guys there could not believe I was borrowing 
&gt; the
&gt; cutting torch and cutting a piece out of the engine bay of a junker, 
&gt; and
&gt; that was going to PAY for it. But it made the repair much easier to

Thanks for this, Scott.

More detail. The bus seems to have been rear-ended at some point 
(before I got it) or the PO backed into a stone wall. The steel and the 
very end of the box panel (frame) is crumpled. It's not structurally 
significant, but I can't put the outboard bumper bolt in; there's no 
captured nut. I've done the best I could pulling out the rear corner 
and smoothing it, but some day in the next couple of years I'm going to 
cut out the entire rear corner from the waist down, reconstruct the box 
(from a junkyard piece), and then redo the rear corner in a new panel. 
That will be the best time to permanently replace this hack, with butt 
welds from the same junkyard bus.

The current repair, in other words, is intended to be temporary but not 
as ugly as what's there.

Absurdly, my battery shelf is completely intact.
