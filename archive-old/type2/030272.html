&gt; NO ONE changes points every 3,000 miles. it's not recommended. I think normal
&gt; life is 12-20k miles for a tune-up. And the points will go much longer. I just
&gt; have a guage with a point resistance setting and use that as my guide. 2
&gt; wires, turn on the ignition, read the meter.

What is the resistance spec for points?  I'd assume it's quite low, since
they're supposed to be a switch!

&gt; I think Pertronix is  a &quot;poor answer to a question no one asked&quot;!

I tend to agree.  I get a _lot_ of miles on a set of points and very
seldom need to adjust them.  Perhaps 30K miles on points and 10K between
adjustments.  Once worn in, they are very stable.
