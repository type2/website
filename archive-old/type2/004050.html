I was considering that as well, and with my cargo area minus the rails in
the rear of my 72, i should be able to fit one that could sit low.  However,
I am concerned about how much cutting we're talking about here.  My Westy
has it's share of oddities and bondo from previous lives, but nothing like a
big piece of the roof missing.  How extensive will the cut be?

Another, slightly more cheesy idea that would not require cutting is a tiny
window unit for camping only, that could be used through the rear-facing
pop-top window.  I have also imagined something using the spar tire well
space and the engine compartment.  Any ideas?  I wouldn't bother if it
weren't for the 100*-plus summers with 99% humidity that comes with living
on the Gulf Coast.

Thanks,
Wade
