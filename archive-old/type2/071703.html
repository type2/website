Subject: Re: [T2] Deck Height/CR

Jim

I think you're missing something here.  Compression ratio is the 
ratio of the total cylinder volume uncompressed over the volume at 
TDC or compressed. Look in the list library for more info on 
calibrating this.

If you used the deck height you mentioned on this engine The CR would 
be 5.64:1 w/ .200 and 6.30:1 w/ .125&quot; deck height.  They would run 
but you wouldn't have any power.  The factory specs on this engine 
are 7.3:1 CR.

The Muir quote isn't taking into effect the larger chamber and dished 
pistons on a two litre engine.  With fly cutting of heads, etc, you 
can't just look at deck height.  You must do the math on all the 
ingredients.

I can send you a excel CR &amp; Deck height calculator if your interested.

&gt;
&gt;Your deck height is way low. Muir says no less than .040&quot;, a &quot;high
&gt;performance&quot; engine will have deck height of no less than .060&quot;, and some
&gt;guys are building engines with .250 deck height. I'd set it at no less than
&gt;.125&quot; to get the compression ratio down. (I'm putting .200&quot; on the T4 I'm
&gt;building.)
