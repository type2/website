&gt; Hi,
&gt; I have been discussing mechanical fuel injection conversion for my bus with
&gt; Gary Miller of miller fuel injection [check out his webpage-address at the
&gt; end of this note] and I recieved the following reply regarding his producing
&gt; a kit to fill our application and allowing us to scrounge our own parts.

Pat and others,

My bus is a testiment to CIS mechanical fuel injection.  It's in an upright
converted engine and I'm loving the system.  When I put mine together, I would
have jumped at a chance to pick up the runners from Gary if he had them
available.  Converting a type I bus to CIS has been done and Gary has off the
shelf stuff to do it as well as the type IV powered bus.

One problem that I had with these early fuel injection systems was the abilty of
the system to perform properly around high power RF fields as coming from ham
radio transmitters.  One vehicle I had would slow down or stumble every time I
keyed the mike.  The dealers response was to tell me not to operate the radio
while driving.  I had instances where a trucker driving by with CB antennas and
due to the car's reaction, I am assuming a BIG amplifier which caused problems
with the car.  With the CIS system, no ill effects would be observed in either
of these cases.

Since the mention of outside events on the operation of our vehicles (ie, Y2K
;-})  We all know that our aircooleds with carbs would survive an EMP (nuclear
blast), you can add CIS powered to that list also.  There are no semiconductor
electronics to fry from the pulses.  So all you survivalists out there with EFI
and wonder if your bus will get you around after an EMP event, think about CIS
(ok ok, a little too dramatic, but heck its fun and the end of the 1000's)

Happy New Year to ALL!!!!!

Scott
