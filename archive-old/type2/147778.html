Subject: Re: [T2] Evaluating CV joints...

Hey Daniel-

I've always just used a block of wood and a &quot;BFH&quot; to knock the CVs off the
shafts. Just make sure you're not hitting metal-to-metal, and that you're
putting the force as close to the shaft itself as possible. They should come
off without too much trouble, but maybe someone here has a better
&quot;pressless&quot; method.

As far as inspecting for good vs. bad, clean every bit of grease out of the
joints (only do one at a time, so that you don't get parts mixed up). I
usually just use gasoline, but Saf-T-Clean would be a better choice. I also
find an old toothbrush and about 80psi of compressed air helps here.

Look for pitting of the ball bearings, uneven wear surfaces and excessive
heat damage. Some wear is expected, so use good judgement and go from there.
The &quot;cage&quot; will come apart fairly easily, so make sure you always have at
least one other joint intact so you'll know how it's supposed to go back
together! It can be frustrating, but once you figure it out they're pretty
hard to screw up. Just make sure there's no binding anywhere when you move
it around by hand.

The last time I did this, I put the new boots and the clean joints back on
the shafts BEFORE I repacked them. It made for a much cleaner install! Once
the joints are back on, and with the boots peeled back, pack the crap out
of'em with fresh grease, moving the joint around the center cage until all
of the balls are thoroughly greased, and there's plenty of &quot;reserve&quot; back
behind.

I've never had any problems with this method, but, as I said, others might
have a different approach and YMMV! Good luck-

JJ
