&gt;Aw shucks :-)  I'm just sitting here hoping that David or one of the other

I think it will work too, but I've not tried this particular swap so I 
can't say for sure.  I am fairly certain that the differences in the late 
shortblock vs. the '72 (including hydraulic lifters, smaller valves, more 
displacement) will not cause a significant problem for the carbs.  Some 
have said that the engine will run lean because of the extra displacement - 
I have not found that to be the case.  If it were my bus though, I'd go 
straight to FI unless time or finances prevented it.  You already have a 
'79 parts bus that you can steal the gas tank (with return line) from.
