well it asked about heat without heater boxes

&gt; I have researched these heaters.  I am familiar with how they work as well

one should get familiar with any and all machinery especially that which
they are responsible for maintaining

&gt; especially airplanes.  Remember the guy whose heater caught fire and started
&gt; some good old magnesium parts to burning?  He didn't make it.  As a matter

haven't heard that one, but anyway I have a 78 so no magnesium

&gt; of fact, we don't have a furnace in our house (and no, we don't live in
&gt; Florida) but that's beside the point.  And, I hardly think that being better

????  well mine is hot water heat but I do have heat and a CO monitor
right next to the furnace

&gt; than a Stewart-Warner is saying much.  Greg, the pieces that flow past the
&gt; tank are two ducts made of sheet metal and joined with a couple of sheet
&gt; metal screws. They are not poorly made but they are plenty thin and barely

as I mentioned mine is in the front of the bus and does not run anywhere
near the gas tank or engine

&gt; antique safety switches and such then it is misplaced.  We did in fact get

those antique safety switches all are designed to fail in the
&quot;off&quot; position I have far more trouble keeping em &quot;on&quot; than anything
else.  and I did add two additional safety switches that were brand new.

&gt; CO poisoning from mine.  Luckily there was some other &quot;byproduct of
&gt; combustion&quot; coming through that we could just barely smell, a sort of hot

well a CO monitor like the one in my basement is located in the cab too.

&gt; bitter gasoline smell.  I could also mention the fact that the thing is not
&gt; even designed for proper fresh intake of air which is to be heated.  Driving

again mine recycles the air and the intake is from cab air, combustion air
is drawn in from under the bus

&gt; it this past March was a real snoozer.  The heater was then replaced with
&gt; another as I thought I could be confident in it if it seemed to be working

well the bugger makes me very vigilant but that is my nature

&gt; right.  I'd bet that not 1 in 100 of these heaters in America is properly
&gt; tested. 

so test it, it is not that hard

&gt; I'd also expect that nobody who designed them was figuring on a
&gt; lifespan of 3 or 4 decades.  Glen Ward

heck the whole bus wasn't expected to but how were they designed, maybe to
last forever but who knows

the heaters require proper maintenance, proper use and vigilance but used
carefully they do work and do the job better than anything else out there.
