Subject: Curtain Material

Hi List,
    Two winters ago I made new curtains for our '71 westy.  The material we
chose wasn't heavy enough to keep out light and we didn't double it up or
put on another layer of white as a number of people have.  I figured I could
always add that second layer if need be.  As it turned out we didn't need
that extra layer at all.  In the morning the fabric dims and diffuses the
daylight enough so that it doesn't wake us up.  Since virtually all VW
campouts are family events I was a bit concerned about what might be evident
or visible through the curtains at night with the lights on in the bus.  As
it turns out that fear was unfounded.
    So when picking your fabric choose what you like.  While you are in the
store hold it up and see how the light comes through it or if you can see
through it.  That's what me and my wife, Kathy, did.  As for the amount of
material needed, I have no idea.  Curtains make a great first fabic project
as there isn't anything fancy or unusual to do.  Heck, you can do it without
any sewing involved if you want to, ask me how I know  :-)
