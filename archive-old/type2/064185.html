&gt;Oh yeah... should I be able to move that flywheel thing by hand if the
&gt;plugs are out cause I haven't been able to get it to budge.

If the water came in to the closed case, it really only has one route
in--through the intakes. Let me guess, the throat(s) of the carb(s) were
open to the weather?

If water came in through the intakes, it pooled in the combustion chambers,
leaked past the rings and made its way slowly into the sump where it buried
itself underneath your oil.

Underneath the oil it can't hurt much, it's sealed in there. It's the
pooling in the cylinders that'll get ya. You may be in for rings corroded
fast to the cylinders (this is why you can't turn the crank and it makes it
a size nine bitch to get the cylinders off) and maybe for serious head
deterioration. Aluminum doesn't rust, but that doesn't mean it doesn't
corrode. It corrodes. It can corrode very muchly.

Don't ask me how I know this. ;) It looks awfully ugly but once you're over
the shock you may well find that the water didn't ruin anything you weren't
going to replace anyway. You needed new heads and cylinders and jugs or you
wouldn't be rebuilding. Your crank will probably be re-grindable. The case
will be alright. Try to keep your wits about you. ;)
