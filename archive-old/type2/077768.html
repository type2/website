Subject: running engine with no seal.   Part2

hello,

thanks to courtney and jim for there expedient
responses! now, second question. what does this
overheating do to the engine. what parts or systems
may be bad if someone had been running a bus with no
seal. 

reason i ask is because i am thinking of buying a type
IV 1979 engine. it has been recently rebuilt but
apparently the dude has been running it with the
engine seal.  thanks again!

Matty
