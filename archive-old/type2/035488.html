Subject: Late Westy front table

Sean's Westfalia owner's guide (for a '78) shows a storage box that sits 
in the walk-through, and a front table. I think I found one of these 
front tables, once, in a junkyard, but I couldn't figure it out. There 
does not seem to be any place on the dash to which it attaches. How did 
it work?

TIA
