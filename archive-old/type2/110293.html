&gt; I guess I'd better re-inspect S9 to make sure it isn't popped.

&gt; Is S9 supposed to be an 8-amp or 16-amp fuse?  Bentley doesn't say.  
&gt; Page 4-5 has a sketch that suggests S9 is 16-amp, but then says that 
&gt; the slots that take a 16-amp fuses &quot;varies among model years&quot;.  It 
&gt; then refers me to the vehicle's owner's manual, which I don't have.

Err, of course the fuse doesn't matter ... since the ignition switch is 
tapped on the upstream side of the fuse.

In any case... I went out and checked both sides of S8 and S9 with the 
VOM ... no voltage.

Now I'm beginning to wonder if something truly scary like &quot;nut came 
loose and fell off leaving + from battery dangling around underneath 
the bus&quot; has happened.  Or maybe something equally annoying, but a lot 
less scary, like &quot;wire that connects ignition switch to terminal 30 on 
solenoid is dangling around underneath the bus&quot;.  (Either way I'm going 
to have to push the damned thing away from the curb to look, grumble.)

Geez, and the loose wire theory might explain the initial &quot;when revved&quot; 
behavior, too.
