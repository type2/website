Subject: Re: getting rid of points

I could recuse myself from this discussion, but I'll just say up front that 
I sell Hot-Spark electronic ignition conversion kits. But I'll try to be 
objective here.

When using &quot;electronic ignition&quot; or points replacement conversions, dwell 
angle and timing don't deteriorate, so the engine always has that &quot;fresh 
tune up&quot; feel to it - ignition-wise, anyway.

With air-cooled VWs, ideal dwell angle with a new set of points is about 49 
or 50 degrees. Dwell angle with some of the solid state points replacement 
modules or &quot;electronic ignition&quot; units ranges from 52 to 60 degrees or more. 
The extra dwell time before the coil fires allows the coil to build up a 
bigger charge, resulting in a hotter spark at the plugs.

I installed a Pertronix unit in my bus in 1995 or so. It still worked 
perfectly when I removed it to test a Hot-Spark ignition module about a year 
ago. I'm still running the Hot-Spark unit. Electronic ignition provides 
quicker starts, smoother idling, better gas mileage and a bit more power 
than breaker points ignition. With electronic ignition, dwell and timing 
don't drift and deteriorate.

I've heard VW purists say that points work perfectly well; it's no problem 
to keep them adjusted, etc. I say fine, if you like adjusting points and 
timing, well, there are worse hobbies to have, I guess. Some also say that 
electronic ignitions are not reliable; they fail, leaving you walking. 
Almost always the problem is that electronic ignition units burn up because 
the installer hooked them up backwards, i.e., reversed the polarity. I've 
installed Compu-Fire, Pertronix and Hot-Spark. All three have been very 
reliable. We did have a problem with the Compu-Fire &quot;distributorless&quot; 
system - The coil-pack (four coils on one board) had a high failure rate. 
But the Compu-Fire Hall sensor/triggering unit was very reliable.

You can always keep a set of points and a condenser in the glove box if it 
makes you feel better.

Compufire and Pertronix ignition kits for VW cost about $60-70; the 
Hot-Spark electronic ignition conversion kit for VW costs about $40. They're 
all available in versions for stock vacuum-advance dizzies or in a version 
for 009 or 050 centrifugal-advance distributors.

I read yesterday in some FAQ

 &quot;So you've bought a CDI or Pertronix or upgraded your ignition system
 and this has increased your mileage.&quot;
&gt; the same article says it could go from 16 to 26 mpg!
&gt;
&gt; I'd be happy to increase it a few mpg!  does installing an electronic
&gt; system really help and if so, which is recommended?  And the cost
&gt; woudl be about $180. (I thought it would be about $100) Also, do I
&gt; need to get replace my distributor, the lobes have worn down.
&gt;
 Thanks

John K
