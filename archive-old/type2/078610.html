Subject: rocker arms??

hello all,

thank you very much to all who supplied feedback to
all three of my previous questions.

how often do rocker arms go &quot;bad&quot;? is this a pretty
sturdy element of the head, or should it be replaced?
how would i know if the ones on the engine currently
are still good for re use? if there bad, anyone have
any advice or cautions as to brands? thanks in
advance!!!

Matty
