&gt; Hey all.
&gt; I have a question concerning the calipers on my 71 bus.  I have taken the
&gt; front wheels off, as well as the calipers.  For one, the bleeder valves
&gt; are both broken off, and I'm talking flush.  What should I do?  The
&gt; calipers look in hard shape.  Should I rebuild these, or just get &quot;new&quot;
&gt; ones?  Are there kits out there that I can do a complete rebuild, and if
&gt; so, where can I get it?

Any good brake supply house should be able to supply you with rebuild
parts.  Consider, though, the hassle in getting the bleed screws out.  You
might be better off just getting rebuilt calipers.

&gt; Also, I have decided to heed the Muir's book's advice, and have a
&gt; mechanic do the ball joints, since I don't have the tools for this.  Is
&gt; this a wise choice?  Has anyone out there ever done the ball joints?

I did it this way and wasn't happy with the way the mechanic cut corners.
Instead of taking off the backing plates (3 little bolts) he just bent
them out of the way and then bent them back,  If I had it to do again, I'd
take the trailing arms out myself and take the bare arms to the shop to
have the new ball joints pressed in.
