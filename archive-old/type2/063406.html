hiyadavid,

every vw person i've talked to about oil filters strongly suggests
you stay away from Fram oil filters. i don't know anyone *personally*
that has had one explode, but i've heard it on the list before and today
someone posted something about one exploding. i use bosh oil filters.
i believe they have a release valve or something that keeps that from
happening. and generally i trust bosch stuff more then others. i've
just heard too much bad stuff about Fram filters to tempt fate.
