&lt;&lt; Think driving an electric vehicle is clean??? The power plant that burns

fuel to produce the electricity to charge that car's battery pack puts out

more pollutants than a car the same size as the electric running a gasoline

engine. It all depends on where you want your pollutants.

 &gt;&gt;

From the &quot;can't win files&quot;...Wind generated electricity (14% of Norway's
power, BTW), touted by some environmentalists as a partial answer to
pollution/green house gases has run into objections by others...The fans
are not user friendly to some birds and noise pollution has also been
mentioned...The NIMBY groups have also raised objections to a few sites,
claiming that the wind farms obstructed their views of, at least in one
case, the seaside...
So, drive the Bus, or take the bus...You can't win; you can't break even,
and you can't quit... ;-(
