Subject: Re: [T2] pair of wiper arms 68

You can mount 69-79 wiper arms just by changing the wiper shafts that come
through the cowl. See:

http://www.airheadparts_dot_com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&amp;ProdID=4880

The only other thing you would need are the cap nuts that would hold the
later wiper arms on.  See:

http://www.airheadparts_dot_com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&amp;ProdID=4213

Both are made by VWG and sold thru Airhead Parts.

&gt; No. Only '68 wiper arms will fit in a 1968 Bus.
&gt; By the way: is it possible to change them for a later model wiper arms? If
&gt; so,
&gt; what do i need to do?
&gt; Thanks.
