Subject: Brake Fluid Reservoir '71
Mime-Version: 1.0


I have a '71 with the brake fluid reservoir mounted behind the driver's
seat and it is separate from the master cylinder/booster which of course is
under the bus.  The problem is that the reservoir itself is leaking either
at the seam in the plastic or at the rubber gasket so that it is completely
empty overnight and the fluid is in a nice puddle on the seat base.

	Has anyone replaced this with another type of reservoir like a Ford or
Chevy etc. since I believe the OEM one is no longer available?
