Subject: Re: [T2] Canvas cleaning, Cot location.

the cot is supposed to be stored on the top of the
cabinet, it would have originally had a small leather
pouch that fit over the end of the cot that stuck out.
 i leave mine in the garage unless im going camping
and plan to use it, but id like to hear where others
conveniently stash theres if not above the cabinet?

&gt; I finally got a child's cot for Itch. Yippie! Two
&gt; questions.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) What should I use to clean the canvas? The
&gt; wifee-poo doesn't think the
&gt; washing machine is good. Steam clean? Water &amp; soap &amp;
&gt; scrub?
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Where does one store this thing in the bus? It's
&gt; too long for the top of
&gt; the cabinet.
