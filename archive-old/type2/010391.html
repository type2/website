Howdy folks,

Well, I did not get as far as I would have liked.  I was planning on working
all weekend to swap some engine, but woke up Saturday morning with a cold,
and by Saturday night I was feeling pretty awful.  So I was only able to get
the bad engine out.  I stripped the exhaust and needed pieces off for
cleaning or repair.  

This engine seems pretty complete, in terms of little knick-knacks here and
there.  I am seeing little parts that I have never seen before, but
obviuosly belong there, so I'll be swapping them over to the good engine
whenever I finish the job.

I found a little bracket that attaches the left heat exchanger (inner most
upper bolt) to the fan housing.

How the hoses and tubes all work on the original smog air injector thang,
and how they plumb into the carbs and such.  I've got all those pieces boxed
and bagged off to the side.

And two listees even stopped by Saturday afternoon!  Unfortunately I was out
picking up some exhaust gaskets.  Sorry Bill and Mike.  And on the way home
the starter in the white bus stopped working.  Not the best of days.

Oh well, in another couple of weeks I'll get another chance to get the good
engine, in the nice bus (with a working starter).  Gotta love.

take care,
        brandy
