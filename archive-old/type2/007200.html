Subject: Where's my engine number?

I bought a 71 Deluxe 6 weeks ago and I just got around to checking the
engine number on what I believed was the original engine. It's a dual port
1600 but under the generator pedestal is NOTHING. There is no hint of a
number anywhere. I have yet to remove anything from the engine yet as my
wife won't let me work on it until my other projects are done, you know the
non-hobby projects. . . at least she let me buy it!

But where is my engine number do I have a Mexican or Brazilian engine case
perhaps? The only hint of lettering I can see is an 'M' stamped right behind
the crankshaft pully.
