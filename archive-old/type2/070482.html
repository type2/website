Subject: Need Advice: Replacing swing lever center pivot pin/bushing, etc. '79 bus

All,

Anybody have experience and useful suggestions or possible pitfalls 
regarding replacing the swing lever center pivot pin and bushing?  
How about adjusting/replacing the steering box?  I  have these parts 
and thought I'd at least replace the pivot pin and bushing tommorrow 
(Saturday).

Maybe I should mention that the ball joints and tie rods have just 
been replaced.  The steering still has a bit of slop and is hard to 
keep from weaving like I'm DWI at 50+ mph.

TIA

Roy
