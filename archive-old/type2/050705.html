Subject: [T2] many thanks

volks,

over the last few weeks, i have asked many a question and i have received 
wonderful replies, suggestions and leads.  i just wanted to extend my 
gratitude!

now, i checked out this place...some of you may be familiar with, parts 
place, inc.  a friend of mine that races vw's recommended them for parts 
(and for recycled parts.)  their web site is still under construction so 
the best way to communicate, is to call.  248.373.2300 (Michigan)

anyway, i originally called them, because their catalogue says: we have 
many camper parts.._dot_call for info.  well, much to my dismay, a 
junkyard...the name wasn't disclosed.._dot_came in and purchased all of their 
camper interior inventory.  all they had left was a poptop or two.  i was 
assured that they frequently get campers in and to &quot;keep calling and 
bugging them.&quot;

so, here's a question/statement:  if anyone knows of where i could get 
ahold of a icebox(or fridge)/stove cabinet unit for a 1975 (behind 
passenger)...they would remain forever in my heart.  i don't necessarily 
need the fridge or icebox, but i wouldn't complain if it was included.  i 
just know that the cabinet would be a good start.  i had a line on one, but 
didn't realize that i WAS for my model year.  unfortunately i passed on it, 
and it was sold.  ah, you win some, you lose some!

anyway, happy friday....and i'm proud to say that my vw is powered by 
TYPE2.COM.
