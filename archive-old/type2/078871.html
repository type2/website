Subject: Thermostat stuff...

I was reading the posts about the thermostat. I checked out John Connolly's 
sight, and what exactly is this for? Where should I look for it? How do I 
know if mine is bad? More than likely (It's a VW right?) mine needs 
replaced. Just checking as I'm always trying to learn about the bus.
