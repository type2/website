Real quick one here:
NOTE: Pmail ME, or Steve will have steam shooting out of his ears!
Ill get back to yall later in the week.

What is the *strangest* thing you have carried in your Type2?

Ill start it off by saying: 1 Dog, 1 Cat and 4 Geese! No crates!
(Thank the Gods I had a bench seat! Dog on front floor,
Geese in the back, cat on the dashboard, usually in front of me.)
