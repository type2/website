Subject: Dead on the Water, Camping AC set up.

Ok I've been doing a lot of thinking and here is an idea I have, which
will be tested this weekend.
No velcro--nor zippers, no putting a dent into the door with the
Stantowski, hang on the door, and luggage rack &quot;who stole the Kheska&quot; AC
unit---
My plan is such----
5000 BTU unit on the luggage rack, with a piece of 3&quot; foam under it to
eliminate the harmonic vibration of the unit----
Now I take a 8&quot; flexible duct ( much like dryer duct only bigger) and
attach it to a piece of masonite, or 1/16th plywood and attach it to the
output side other AC unit-----
Now I run it to the screen / window of the upper bunk, with another
piece of masonite, or plywood, with the correct circumference hole.
I just lay the plywood up against the inside of the pop top--and crank
the AC unit on----no denting of the door, no appendigy hanging out the
window, and this thing will be direct drive into the Van via the pop
top.
No pins, no pads, no Rube Goldberg brackets hanging off the top of the
luggage rack----the run of the duct will be no more than 8--to-- ten
inches--so not much BTU loss.
And if you want more BTU's inside, hang a clamp on fan to the interior
horizontal bracket for the pop top brace right behind the screen opening
to power feed the AC into the Van----

The condensation will run out and down the drain holes of the pop top.

Trial run this week end---
This sounds much too simple to be true.

Stosh-----meet the Hungarian mad man----my wheels have been spinning on
this unit for some time---and I think this is a unique,and relatively
simple solution---


Later,

Mr. Gary Indiana
