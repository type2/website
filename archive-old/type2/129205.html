Subject: Re: [T2] Hidden Danger in Low Mileage Tires

 &gt; The Brand isn't significant in this issue...

But suitability is.  The tires were Dunlop/Hercules YP-821s (as recommended in the tire faq in 1997) - passenger car tires that shouldn't have been used in the first place and was probably what was more responsible for the failure than age.
