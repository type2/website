Subject: Re: Starter Problems ????

Because the wire run from the engine to the ignition switch and back to the
starter is so long, there isn't much current left to activate the solenoid,
once things start getting old.

Common practice with buses is to install a relay between the ignition switch
and the solenoid, with a fused direct lead from the battery through the relay
to the solenoid.

A Hella lighting solenoid works great.
