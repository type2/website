&gt;Alrighty, I have all new seals for my doors (including complete front door 
&gt;seals.)  I perused through the archives and didn't find much on the best 
&gt;method of installation.
&gt;
&gt;So, can someone direct me to a good resource for installing all of my door 
&gt;seals?  
&gt;Also, where is a good source to find Dynamat (or cheaper equivalent) door 
&gt;plastic?  

Melissa:

Try JCWhitney for generic Dynamat.  I bought 2 rolls and it works well.  Here's the link:       http://www.jcwhitney_dot_com/catsubpic.jhtml?CATID=3033

Also, check the type2_dot_com archives for an article written by Bulley concerning sound-proofing your bus.  He makes some good suggestions on vapor barriers, as well as sound and heat insulating that will help.
