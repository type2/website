Subject: Friday topic: High Country Literature

High Country Bus Festival in Boone, NC is coming up in a few weeks. If you are
coming I have a request:

I will be bringing my laptop and scanner to the campout and I would like to
scan any VW brochures, pamphlets, ads, any sort of Baywindow bus literature
you may have for my website so that the entire VW community may enjoy them.
Here are some of the things I already have if you are interested:

http://www.baywindowbus_dot_com/magazineads.htm

Here is a pic of me and my bus so you can find me:

Or if you have any literature already scanned that you can email me directly
that would be much appreciated!! Feel free to add a link to this site from
your site if you wish.

Thanks,

Rob Henley
