Subject: Re: [T2] 6V starter needed

See you have the standard geocities prob when i tried to check your site 
for a local.  Where are you located?  I can check my old bug stuff in 
the shed and see if i still have one.  I am assuming that all 6v were 
the type 1 type tranny using the same bushed starter.
