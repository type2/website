Subject: Re: [T2] oil pressure

The attitude of your bus makes a big difference. Mine,
even when it looked level, could read full and be a
quart low. I went so far as to use a level on the door
threshold to try to keep track of what is level
according to the oil sump. In any case, when that
light comes on, it means the pressure is below 6psi so
revving the motor is not a good idea! The oil pickup
is pretty much centrally located in the sump. Level
attitude will help. Revving causes what is called
&quot;windage&quot; which actually causes the oil level in the
sump to be blown by the wind off the crankshaft
rotating, causing a low spot in the middle. I added
baffles to my oil pickup and a 914 windage tray to
make sure there was always oil available at high rpms
and in hard cornering.

I had a situation where a shop (I do all my own now!)
had not installed the proper o-ring where the oil
pickup tube joins the case. Whenever I allowed the oil
level to get down a bit or in hard cornering, the pump
would draw air through that opening and I had to take
the oil pressure sender off and use a turkey baster to
pump oil into the oil line to prime the pump! It
worked, but what a PITA! Carry extra oil always with a
T4 motor especially. -BaH

&gt; Well, I had a chance to play a gig last night up on
&gt; Lookout Mountain,  one of my favorite drives.  The
&gt; Bopmobile is leaking about a quart  of oil every
&gt; three weeks.  I checked it a couple of days ago and 
&gt; it wasn't quite a quart low so I didn't fill it up. 
&gt; I meant to  fill it yesterday afternoon but forgot
&gt; all about it until I started up  the mountain.  I
&gt; also forgot my 5 gallon jug of Castrol.  As  I
&gt; started up the mountain I was able to maintain 30
&gt; MPH in third.   But the oil pressure light kept
&gt; flashing on and off.  As the grade  got steeper, I
&gt; would shift into second.  It occasionally flashed 
&gt; even with the engine revved in second.  So now I'm
&gt; thinking I've  leaked more oil than I thought.  When
&gt; I got to the top of the  mountain I found a 7-11 and
&gt; bought a $4.16 quart of Castrol (must've  been the
&gt; good stuff).  I poured it in and checked the oil.  
&gt; Exactly on the full line.  Played the gig at
&gt; Covenant College,  which used to be a hotel where Al
&gt; Capone and other
&gt;  gangsters liked to  hang out and gamble.  Going
&gt; back down the mountain I never saw the  light.  So
&gt; one quart makes a big difference in oil pressure.  
&gt; I've always heard that it's better on an engine to
&gt; run it a quart low  than to overfill it.  Evidently
&gt; that's not the case in Type  2's.  Thoughts?  
&gt; Cheers...KR
