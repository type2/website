Subject: 79 Westy finally started

All,

Thanks to all that responded to my plea for help.  I spent the weekend 
trying to start the 79 Westy.  Unfortunately with all of the suggestions 
in mind, none of them resolved the problem of not starting.  I took it to 
Motormania, here in Austin, purely out of frustration.  Fortunately I do 
trust Roger there to do a good job, as we know each other, and he does 
business with my wife's store.  Needless to say when I took it to him the 
battery was flat.  He said he put it on a charger for the entire morning, 
and when he hooked it up he adjusted the timing (as I had the dist. out 
to change the condenser), replaced the points, and started it.  He said 
he took it out for a drive, turning it off, and on trying to repeat the 
no start problem, but it did not reoccur.  I then asked him to check the 
charging circuit,as Bentley, and someone on the list I believe (though in 
an unrelated post) made mention of the battery being able to supply 
enough juice to turn the starter, but not provide enough spark to start 
the engine.  When I pick it up tomorrow I will ask him of the results fo 
the search.

to recap what I had done:

Plug wires - 2.5 months ago
Plugs - 4 days ago
Cap, rotor, points, 2.5 months ago
Condenser - 3 days ago

The consensus reached my a co-worker and I, was that a combination of the 
points, and a weakened battery (how I have yet to discover) caused the no 
start problem. Though I thought the points would last longer than 2.5 - 3 
months.

Hopefully this will not happen again. If it does though, I know have a 
better idea of what to check.

Thanks,

David
