Hi Gary,

The end was in no way catastrophic. I was getting the bus ready to smog 
it, had adjusted the valves, ran the engine for a few minutes, shut it 
off, went into the house for something, came back out and tried to 
start it again. The starter just spun like a madman. By then, of 
course, the cam was likely attached by one or two remaining rivets, and 
then none.

I really doubt that stuck lifters or sticking valves caused this, 
because I went on adjusting valves frequently as this (undiagnosed) 
problem seemed to get worse (the noise, that is). Of course, I know now 
that I was wasting my time. It was impossible to adjust the valves 
_correctly_ for obvious reasons. But all the valves moved properly with 
a turn of the alternator bolt.

Low oil pressure is possible, of course; I hadn't yet finished hooking 
up my oil pressure gauge when this happen. But there's no sign of 
damage to the cam's journals or to the bearings. Oil pump turned freely 
when I removed it.

See Paul's post about this being relatively common in high-mileage 
engines. Also, my reply to VWBrain (Mark Dearing), in which I speculate 
that this was initiated by incorrect flywheel endplay, and then just 
got worse over time.

Mark
