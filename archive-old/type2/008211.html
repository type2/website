Subject: Re: road trip in 71 firebus from MO to TX

&gt;anyhow, i am taking my 71 from St. Louis, MO down to Ft. Worth texas
&gt;sometime this week, and staying through the weekend.  After being in 
Ft.
&gt;Worth a few days i may decide to head about the area down to galveston 
or
&gt;perhaps to ?  sort of an indeterminate non-plan type plan.  I havent 
even
&gt;decided wether to go through OK or AR to get there yet... but i have 
the
&gt;bus tuned up and ready to go (or at least as ready as one can get one 
of
&gt;these cranky old beasts.)
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, i thought i'd post to the list to see if anyone was interested 
in
&gt;perhaps meeting or had some good tips for places to go/things to see 
etc.

Hey Stephen,

I live in Springfield, MO and regularly travel to Dallas. I usually go 
through OK via I-44 to Big Cabin and south on HWY 69 down through 
Muskogee, Atoka, Durant, etc.  If you're looking for a scenic drive this 
is not the way to go, but it is by far the quickest. The most 
interesting things along the way would probably be Bass Pro Shop in 
Springfield and the antique malls in Muskogee, OK. Conley Motors in 
Muskogee is also worth stopping at because he has several old VW's in 
stock for driving or rebuilding.  He has Ghias, busses, campers, and 
beetles. He even had a nice split window single cab there around 
Christmas.  I usually spend an hour or so there just perusing through 
the inventory.  The lot is on the east side of HWY 69 just as you get 
into Muskogee.

If you have plenty of time, then I would suggest going through the 
western part of Arkansas.  A nice scenic trip is HWY 7 south of 
Harrison, AR which is on HWY 65 south of Springfield.  This goes all the 
way through Hot Springs, AR which should start the horse racing season 
any day now if it hasn't already.  This is the most scenic trip, even 
though the trees will not have any leaves this time of the year.  HWY 71 
south of Joplin, MO down through Fayettville, AR and onto Texarkana, 
AR/TX is also somewhat scenic without adding all the time consuming 
hills and curves of HWY 7.  There's a new interstate that just opened 
from Fayettville, AR to Fort Smith, AR that is suprisingly scenic and 
has one of the only mid-west tunnels I am aware of.  The tunnel goes 
through a mountain and is about 1/4 mile long.  

If you need more specific directions then e-mail me and I can help you 
out.  If you don't have any specific place to go in Texas, then you 
can't go wrong with San Antonio.  Galveston kinda stinks this time of 
the year.  Have a good trip wherever the road leads you.
