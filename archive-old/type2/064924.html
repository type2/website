&gt;With the Singlecab, I don't want to reach the point of saturation
&gt;where I can't sell it for what I have into it.

Then bail. Fold. Get out while you still can. Seriously, you do not do a
full resto on a car with limited collector appeal and expect to break even
or even close to even. You can get an excellent bus that somebody *else*
took a bath on for a third of what you're going to dump into that money pit
of yours.
