Subject: RE: vw theft prevention

I was thinking about my friends headphones kill switch last night and the
following occurred to 
me. Use the cigarette lighter as your kill switch. Put a small pushbutton
switch in the back of the 
lighter socket hooked in series with the ignition. Set it up so when the
lighter is in its
normal position, the van won't run, but when you push the lighter into the
heatup position, it
depresses the pushbutton allowing the car to start. Because the lighter will
no longer get hot
it won't pop back out by itself. When you stop, just pull the lighter back
out to its normal
off position.
If you are subtle with your wiring mods this would be hard to 
figure out with a quick look under the dash. I mean what thief trying to
hotwire a car is 
going to study the cigarette lighter? Similarly if you are stealing a car
and it won't start, 
who would think of pushing the cigarette lighter in?!
