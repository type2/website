&gt; I don't know the size of ring you are speaking about, but I got a BIG
&gt; set of snap ring pliers from Sears for like $15.  They are MUCH heavier
&gt; than the removable tip things.  About the size of tin snips.  I bought
&gt; them for removing the snap ring on an upright crankshaft.

Shawn,

Internal or external?  Sears sells a *beautiful* pair of large *external*
snap ring pliers...  I have 'em, I love 'em, I used mine an hour or so ago
to take the ring off the CV's.  Alas, I have never seen an equivalent for
*internal* snap rings.  If you have, *PLEASE* let me know!!!  Especially
post the Sears part/tool number!!!!

The ring I am removing, BTW, is ~72mm or near to 3&quot; in diameter.  A BIG
murphy.
