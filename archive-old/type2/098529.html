Hmmm, the Taiwan &quot;alternator conversion kit&quot; tin has this hole. but the
two genuine German alternator backing plates I have do not.  The doghouse
tin has a hole for the plug wire holder on either side of the backing
plate tin and it doesn't really need a holder in the middle of the backing
plate as well.  If this hole isn't used for a plug wire holder it should
certainly be closed up securely, as it causes a leak of the alternator
cooling air.
