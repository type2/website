One question:

Does your engine still have the thermostat/flaps installed?

If I understand this correctly, the purpose of these flaps is to bring 
the engine up to operating temps in an expedient manner, and then once 
there, maintain them regardless of the ambient temperature/idling 
speed.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but those with this configuration still a part 
of their engine probably do not have a problem with this issue.
