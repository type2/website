Subject: Re: [T2] wanted - 75 FI cyl. head

you betcha its a PITA. i've changed it a few times in this here mismatched
head, and its a KILLER's killer. drove me ape sh!t everytime. panicking
just thinking about it.
that's why i need the LEFT SIDE.

&gt;You need to specify left or right. Big difference in the left head on a 75
&gt;1800 FI. The EFI temp sensor is not next to the #3 intake. It sits above the
&gt;#3 intake port at a 45 degree angle below the spark plug. A major PITA to
&gt;replace.
&gt;You can use a left head on the right but no way no how can you use a right
&gt;head on the left.
&gt;On a 2.0L head you could drill and tap a right head to go on the left. But on
&gt;a 1.8, the head is cast with a boss for the hole.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; anybody want to trade/sell one of their 371H (or S) cyllinder heads for
&gt;&gt; fuel injection? - steve
