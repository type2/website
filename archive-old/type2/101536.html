Subject: Selling 75-78 crossover tube!

I have the exhaust unit removed from my 76 bus, and i swapped to 72-74 style
exhaust, so do not need this anymore.

Please note, this unit is in perfect shape, no holes, etc, and is the vw
piece, not aftermarket............
pmail and i can send you a link to it.
