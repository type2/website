Hi John,

&gt; if you have ever raced, you would know that increasing the engine

Sure for racing, the same as mechanical only advance is fine for racing.
All on or all off.  Drive the same race car on the street and load up the
plugs.  Ever notice the racers blipping their throttles to keep the cold
race plugs cleaned off?

When you buy the performance Carter or Holley, it comes set up with jetting
5 to 10 sizes too big for a street engine, depending on the engine of
course. They have to usually be jetted down quite a bit.

For racing, I shoot for maximum power, an air fuel ratio of 12.6:1.  Big
Jets. Most racer don't run power valves.

An O2 sensor equipped car is tuned for the stoichiometric ideal of 14.7:1.

The VWs for the street at cruise, not wide open throttle, run okay at 14:1
but I prefer richer for cooling.

Watch the mixture with an accurate guage.  My 1974 1800's carbs were stock
with the 130 main jets.  I put in the 1979 2.0L engine I had and, as I did
not have the complete FI system, used the Carbs directly from the 1800.  My
emissions analyzer indicated an enrichment of the mixture.  Same jets, same
venturi size, larger displacement = richer running engine.  (Engine not worn
out or blowing oil.)

&gt; Theory gives way to experience this time.
&gt; I'm not trying to come across as arrogant, but you have to fatten up the
&gt; main jets if the displacement is increased.

My experience proves the theory.  If the published theory that I paraphrase
in my explanations is wrong in your experience, how can it be true in mine?
