&gt; Volks,

&gt; I just had my rear end raised last week on my 71.  Got sick of not
being
&gt; able
&gt; to see anything other than pavement out the back window.  It had
never been
&gt; done
&gt; before so the mechanic moved it 1 notch.  Now the bus looks
perfectly level
&gt; and I can brace for rear impact with confidence. :)  He told me that
if we
&gt; had done 2 notches it may have hit on the upper portion of the arm
(total
&gt; cost out the door - $113.00).
&gt; 
&gt; I got to watch (I don't experiment with repairs on this bus) and
learned
&gt; allot about the rear suspension.

If he just moved it one notch on the outer spline it is very likely
set too high now.  One notch is 8 degrees and you're trying to hit a
window of less than one degree of correct angle.  It's very unlikely
that it has sagged that much!

If the bus is correctly set, then you should not be able to see the
horizon out of the back window with the inside mirror.  The horizon
will be above the upper edge of the window.

I made this same mistake when I got my bus and didn't figure it out
until I tore the CV boots and damaged one of my CV joints.  They
aren't made to operate at the large angles imposed by a &quot;jacked up&quot;
bus.  The handling, ride, and tire wear were also made worse by being
too tall.
