Hey all,
finally getting around to replacing my flywheel seal after using 11 qts to
and from Everybus.  It has been parked since I returned.  We (me and my
mechanic friend Derek) dropped the engine from the SnoopyBus (73 1800) last
night.  No problems on removal.  The flywheel seal was one year old and hard
as a rock.  Any way we spent a half hour looking for a plate or something to
install the new seal as I did not have the proper tool.  After we found
something that would work we lubed up the seal and pressed it to the opening
to set it and it went right in by hand!!!  Derek says he has never seen this
happen before and it worries him.  It did not pull back out by hand.  Should
I be worried?

On another note anyone else having problems with flywheel seals going bad?
This will be my third in as many years. And no I do not overfill my oil...
