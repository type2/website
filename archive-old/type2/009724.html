&gt; &gt;&gt; I'd agree that in really cold weather, the flaps might not always
be
&gt; &gt;&gt; fully open. But I see absolutely no difference in head temp from
the
&gt; &gt;hottest
&gt; &gt;&gt; day to the coldest day, once the engine is warmed up, with flaps in
&gt; &gt;place
&gt; &gt;&gt; but no thermostat.

&gt; &gt;I find this result surprising!
&gt; 
&gt; I do too, and it would surprise me if it worked that way with a
thermostat
&gt; as well. The (limited) experiments we did with VW thermostats argued
that
&gt; they depend for their opening on the boiling point of some sort of
alcohol
&gt; which is inside the bellows, and open/closed is pretty much a binary
state
&gt; with the thermostat. It cannot be made to sustain a half open state,
&gt; although in cold ambient temperatures it might cycle open and
closed--which
&gt; ought to cause swings in the head temp.

Well, alcohol still has a vapor pressure.  If the vapor pressure of
the alcohol at a particular temperature is less than the pressure of
the &quot;failsafe&quot; spring pressure divided by the thermostat area, then
the thermostat will remain closed.  If the pressure is the same, then
the thermostat opens.

Note that it takes a certain amount of energy to boil the alcohol into
vapor at constant temperature.  This is called the latent heat of
vaporization.  If the temperature of the thermostat is raised to the
boiling temperature and no additional heat is put in, the thermostat
will not open.  A bit more heat will open it up.  The same applies to
closing.  The thermostat will not close until a certain amount of heat
is removed from the open thermostat.

The heat of vaporization provides a hysteresis loop that should allow
for intermediate positions of the thermostat.  Since heat only flows
&gt;from hot things to cooler things, the opening outlet temperature has
to be a few degrees higher than the closing air outlet temperature. 
If the air runs a bit warm, the thermostat opens a bit.  If the air
cools off a bit then the thermostat closes a bit.
