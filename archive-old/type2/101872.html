Subject: Re: [T2] idle air screw

if you are worried about the emmisions test you should should be more 
concerned with the mixture screw ,that is on the ir box.  that adjusts tha 
amount of air that bypasses the the flap inside the box.  but i would not 
reccomend adjusting that screw, you need an exhuast gas anylizer to do it 
properly, but if you must know.  clockwise richens the mixture, counter 
clockwise leans it.  dont get this confused with the idle screw..
