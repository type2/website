&gt; Hello Everybody:
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone out there ever lowered the suspension on a bus??  I'm not talking about slamming it on the ground, but more like a 2 inch drop, especially for the front end.  I do a lot of mountain (OK, really a big hill) driving, with lots of windy twists.  Lowering the center of gravity would make it handle better.  I know the best way to lower almost any suspension is to either get lowered springs or dropped spindles, but nobody makes dropped spindles for a late bus.  Twisting the torsion leaves would work, but would make the ride a little harsh.  Anybody have any suggestions??

IMO, buses were never made to compete in canyon races!  I doubt that a 2
inch lowering would make a lot of difference in the handling.  You might
try stiffer shocks and larger sway bars, which would be much better for
handling, but still wouldn't result in an autocrosser.
