Subject: The '77 westy FI 1/2tank/full tank, I found something need help!!!

Hi all,
I won't repeat the history of the problem again, as I ahve posted it
several times. I found something tonight and can not figure out what it
is. Looking toward the front of the vehicle from the top down in the
engine compartment, on the left side of the intake air distributor
almost directly underneath the air pipe to number 3, is a little
&quot;thingy&quot; with two prongs to attach wires to (not the ground wires, which
are connected directly to the engine, this is just to the left of those)
there are no wires attached to this little thing, nor do I see any wires
that should be attached. Anyone know what this this is, it goes down
into the engine and is secured by a large (like 22mm) nut. It seems to
be some sort of sensor, but it is not sensor #2 which is over next to
the injector for #3. 

Also, I have been trying to make sure that my hoses are all correctly
attached, and noticed that the hose that runs from the evaporation gas
tank tubes that come together just behind the fan for the interior
heater lead down and connected to several &quot;T&quot; connectors, that are
connecting to the red hose from the de-accel unit and run into the air
intake distrib, I believe this tube should run to the charcoal tank????
And the tube that runs from the charcoal tank is shown in the manual as
terminating to the left side of the fan housing, mine is capped off on
the charcoal canister, with only the one tube feading into the air
cleaner still in place. I can not figure out where the tube from the
charcoal canister is suppose to attach to the fan housing.
Thanks,
scoob
