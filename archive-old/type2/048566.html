Subject: [T2] Cream colored substance in oil?

I went out this morning and checked my oil before I left for the day, it was 
about 25 degrees, I was a little low, so I opened the filler lid on my 74 
and there was a cream colored substance that smelled like gas! My dipstick 
had normal oil on it, and didn't smell like gas, so I topped it off and it 
ran just fine. Has anyone ever had this happen before? what is it? I just 
had my engine rebuilt about 5,000 miles ago, so i hope there is nothing 
wrong with it. Anyways, it appears to just be on the underside of the filler 
lid, I am runing 10w40 Any thoughts would be helpful.

Another question I had was about something on the list I read a few days 
ago, I believe someoe said not to run 10w anything if you want your engine 
to last. My mechanic told me to use 20w50 in the summer and 10w40 in the 
winter, I haven't had any problems yet, is there something he and I don't 
know?
