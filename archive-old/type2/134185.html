Subject: Best wire size

Hi Volks- I am running a separate circuit for my accessories and need to
know the best size and type of wire to run from the back of the bus forward.
The last wire I used turned out to be REALLY cheap wire, was very stiff, and
very hard to run to the front. Can anyone suggest a more flexible type of
wire and gauge? TIA Ted
