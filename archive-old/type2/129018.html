Subject: 71 Transporter need a good home - Pictures Up Now

I posted some pictures, Front &amp; Rear views.

&lt;http://f1.pg.photos.yahoo_dot_com/ph/tberk_at_sbcglobal_dot_net/album?.tok=ph0GN8AB.9k18I2u&amp;.dir=/a901&amp;.src=ph&gt;


You'll see nothing major; rear corner has a ding and replacement cover 
of the taillight.

The assembly is still there, it's just the lens that is broken.
btw- it needs a motor rebuild.


Any who, it's currently located between San Francisco and San Jose in 
California. Looking to find it a good home.
