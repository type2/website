Volks,
I am a member on the vanagon list, and recently we did a group purchase with
Gene Berg Ent. for a quick shift kit, and since 40 of us or so ordered, got
about a 40% discount.

I am wondering if anyone out there would be interested in getting a genuine
Berg shifter for their bus.  It is supposed to reduce throw 40% or so, and
have a stiffer feel.  I have seen them in buses, and the owner's swear by
them.  If anyone is interested, pmail me, and I can work out all the details
once I have a number to give Berg............They list in the catalog (Cash
Price) for $161 just so everyone knows ..............we could see what sort
of savings we could get and decide from there.  The last time this was set
up people called Berg direct and mentioned the group purchase, and were
handled with discount thru them.  This seems to work best.
