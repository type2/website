&gt; Question for you all --
&gt; 
&gt; I've been slowly disassembling a 2 liter engine in my spare time, and right
&gt; now I'm working on the crank.  Last night I pulled the fan hub, removed the
&gt; circlip, and the brass gear just pulled right off with my hands.  The spacer
&gt; came off easy, but I couldn't budge the last large gear.  My question is this
&gt; ---  since I don't really want to take it to a shop to have it hydraulically
&gt; pressed off, what are my options as far as gear pullers go?  Can I just buy a
&gt; three-arm rig from Sears?  Will the VW gear puller work (the one that's
&gt; usually about $50)?  What else is there that would work.
&gt; 
&gt; And secondly,  should the brass distributor gear pull off so easily?  Bentley
&gt; says it's an .004 interference fit.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the info,
&gt; 
&gt; Charles

Charles,

The vw crank gear puller you often see will not work. It will only work on a
type 1 crank gear.

The cam gears are really on there tight, and with the steel of both the
crank and the gear being so hard, they can be difficult to remove. You need
a very substantial puller to get it off, I really doubt a sears 3-jaw deal
will work, mostly because the jaw ends don't have enough of a projection to
get into the small space below the gear. Even if you have a good puller, you
might try putting the whole assembly in the freezer for a spell and then
carefully torch heating only the gear. The type of gear pullers that have
straight arms that slide across the top bar will work. Kukko is one brand,
hazet also make them.  They are not cheap...

The brass gear is normally a press fit, you are correct.
