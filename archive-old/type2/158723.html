Subject: Re: [T2] Alloy rims and drum screws

The average Bus owner usually has a heck of a time getting the drum's
off when it's time to change the brakes---



True, now that they are 27 years old+. However, I'm sure back in 1975 the drums on my '75 Westy came off pretty easily. Actually my statement was based on what I was told by a tire shop years ago. American made cars (at least Chevys, anyway) have a flat speed nut on the rear drums, and if you put custom wheels on you must remove it otherwise the custom wheel will be out of balance-I know this from experience. The tire shop told me the only purpose for these speed nuts was to keep the drom from falling off when changing a tire. VW just did it a little differently.    Jeff
