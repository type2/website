&gt; So, assuming the engine is supported in place, 

Bad assumption. Tho it varies in different years, *at best* the drivetrain
is supported at three points: the front of the transmission, the rear of
the transmission, and the rear of the engine.  Some years (68-71) do not
have the rear transmission hangers, so if you take only the engine out
then you must support the transmission.  No year has supports for the
front of the engine, only the rear.

&gt; is it possible (or instead
&gt; maniacal) to remove the tranny without engine removal. 

Even if you could rig some support for the engine, I do not believe it is
possible to remove the trans.  The power train unit (engine/trans) must
move to the rear by 2-3 inches before you can lower the nose of the trans
past the rear torsion bar housing, then the trans must move forward ~6&quot; to
get the input shaft out of the clutch.

Basically, a bad idea all the way around.  I tend to remove the power
train as a unit in preference to engine-only even when only the engine
needs to come out, as I find it easier than removing the engine alone.
