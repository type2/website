Subject: dashboards

Hey Listees, does anyone know if the &quot;skin&quot; or &quot;face&quot; of the dashboard is 
replaceable on a bay?  If so, how difficult?  Mine has a big gash between 
the radio hole and the glove box hole.  I've tried to figure out how to 
repair it but was wondering if the entire black skin could be 
replaced.  TIA,  gt
