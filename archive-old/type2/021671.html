Make sure that &quot;U&quot; shaped joint at the rear of the door is lubed nicely,
but don't use too much or it'll drip down the door and leave streaks on
your paint when it rains..  That should help alot.  Also make sure that
all the door stops are adjusted correctly otherwise they'll just bounce
the lock back out.  I think the bentley shows how to adjust that.

As far as closing from the inside, that's what the second handle at the
rear of the door is for (if your bus has it).  You slide the door until
it's almost all the way shut, and then you can just hold on to the back
handle and pull the back of the door in while sliding it closed.  Now,
showing a non-bus passenger to do this is another story :)

later,
Mike

&gt; Greetings Listerinos,
&gt; 
&gt; 70 Bus here.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm having a little trouble (I think) with my sliding door.  When I close the
&gt; door (from the outside) I need to push (slightly) against the rear of the
&gt; panel to seat the door as I move the handle up to lock it in place.  Of
&gt; course, that little shove one has to give the door makes the door impossible
&gt; to close and lock from the inside of the vehicle.  That's not right, is it?
&gt; 
&gt; So.........a couple of questions.  Just what is the &quot;action&quot; supposed to be
&gt; like when the slider closes?  And, assuming mine is a bit stiff, what is the
&gt; most likely culprit?  I'll get my Bentley out and go through it, but I value
&gt; the voice of experience first.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
&gt; 
&gt; Mike
