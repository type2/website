another conversion? -----Original Message-----

I was looking at these pix of listmember Mike's &quot;Itch,&quot; a '69 CA Westy:
http://home.earthlink_dot_net/~visket/Itch/
My '68 CA Westy has a different shape lid.  Mine is smooth with no step half
way up the side and no ribs.  Do I have an odd-ball?  Is Itch's top a
replacement?  Did Westfalia change the lid in '69?  Inquiring minds want to
know.
