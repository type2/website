Subject: Re: Moisture in my Oil

Thanks to all who replied.

I would like to know if the water in my oil is 
ruining my engine and if I should discard 
that oil PRONTO.

There is no way I am going to keep the 
temps down in the Sub Arctic until spring.

BTW had a lady back right into my front 
bumper today, smashed her bumper on her 
subaru, scrapped some dead bugs and paint 
off mine. Hmmm.

Cheers,
