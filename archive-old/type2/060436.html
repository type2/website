&gt; I actually had a set of Michelin X Radials on my '70 Type 2 for over
12 years

Nope, they were purchased new from Big O Tires, a tire chain of
reasonably good reputation.

One was put into service on the rear of a 1/2 ton chevy van, and the
other was used on a utility trailer.  Neither was ever close to being
overloaded, and they were driven primarily in northern Nevada where
the temps don't go over 90 in the summer.  The only thing odd about
their usage was that they were on vehicles that would occasionally sit
for a few weeks at a time without being used.  Perhaps this is a factor.
