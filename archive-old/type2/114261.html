Subject: RE: [T2] Installing Bus Depot Mudflaps on a 78.

&gt;Has anyone installed mudflaps and can they give me some advice? I bought a 
&gt;set of mudflaps (apparently the last set) from Bus Depot. They came with a 
&gt;photo copied directions page that is barely legible. I can't figure out how

&gt;they fit, the mounting bracket seems too long and they really don't seem 
&gt;like they'll fit. Bus Depot was of no help. Thanks, Jeff

I had the same experience with trying to get help from the guys at Bus
Depot.  They just told me to follow the directions.  I called three times
(never spoke to Ron) and every time I was told to follow the directions.
They aren't very good and I haven't figured out how to load these on a bay.
