When we had our carbs rebuilt during
an engine rebuild,we had trouble with
too much gas,the wrench could'nt get
it to run so he drilled out the jets,we
found out later that the acclerator dump
tube was missing,so we had double the
trouble,look down the throats of each
carb and look for a brass tube squirting
gas,hard to belive,but true.

&quot;Is it because light travels faster than sound that some people appear
bright until they speak?&quot;
