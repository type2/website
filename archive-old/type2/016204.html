Hey Mike,

As far as I know Johh was correct the green deluxe years.  According to your
description, you definitely had the deluxe model.  I have a 76 green deluxe
with a 78 engine.  The only significant changes/improvements from 76-79 that
I'm aware of are:

1.	Hydraulic lifters in 78 which do not require adjusting. You can do a
hydraulic lifter conversion, but it costs about 	$250 in parts and
requires a complete tear down of the engine.  A good idea at rebuild time,
but not worth the 	effort or cost to do the conversion by itself.  

2.	The heads changed in 79 to Vanagon heads, but I don't have an
educated opinion on whether they are better or not.  

3.	I think electronic ignition was available on 79 California spec
busses.  You can add a Pertronix electronic ignition to 	any bus for
about $65 which is what I have and it works great.  Eliminates points and
all the adjustments that go with 	them.    

4.	One very small change I made was changing my steering wheel from a
76 to a 78.  The 76 was the skinny hard plastic type 	and the 78 has the
fat padded rubber vinyl type.  It feels much better and takes all of 5
minutes to switch. I don't 	know what year the wheel changed or if they
changed several times.  I just know my 76 and the 78 were different and the
78 is better.  

5.	The seat rail tracks changed in 77 or 78.  I think they made them
wider so you can switch to Vanagon seats without 	modifications.  I
wish I could do this, but the 76 would require additional work.

6.	All 76-79 were fuel injected, but the system in 1976 had a switch on
the trottle body for full rich.  The switch was 	eliminated in 77?
and the task was taken over by the ECU.  This makes some FI parts
non-interchangable (ECU, wiring 	harness).

7.	I think there were significant changes in the exaust system in 1978,
but I do not know the details.  If you live in CA 	it is probably worth
your while to research this.  I have a 4 tip Empi which I like, but I'm not
certain if you could 	use it in CA.  

Well that's all I can think of right now.  Search the net for your new bus.
I bought a 77 green deluxe about a month ago for $50.  The owner passed away
a couple of years ago and his son in another state just wanted to get rid of
it.  I'll fix it up and sell it, but it won't be any time soon.  Good luck
and take care.

&gt;Ok, I guess I got carried away with the &quot;deluxe&quot; model.  Here are the
&gt;features that I had in my old one:

&gt;Green, 2000 engine FI, Manual tranny, Stove (2 propane burners w/tank
&gt;under sliding door), Sink w/pump, Fridge (AC &amp; Battery), westfalia
&gt;camper model that sleeps two on top and two on the bottom, table in
&gt;back, little table for up front that stood on one pole, hammock in the
&gt;front, umm.. can't think of anything else right now..

&gt;I thought the difference between the deluxe and the standard was the
&gt;icebox or the fridge, but I guess I was mistaken; my bad ;)

&gt;But yeah, I'm thinking anything up to 79.  Were there any major
&gt;changes/improvements on the later models ~79?  I've only had 76s...  I
&gt;wouldn't mind having electronic ignition if it was offered stock on
&gt;later models...
