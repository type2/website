Subject: How do I get the #&amp;(*&amp;!$# distributor gear on the crank?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.OSF.3.91.990224171502.14208A-100000_at_Sherlock.SIMS.Berkeley.EDU&gt;

Hi all:

I've been trying to get the brass distributor gear on my 2 crankshafts,
(rebuiling a couple of 2.0l air-cooled engines) and haven't succeded yet.

I first tried heating the gears in oil, the second time I tried boiling
water.  But in both cases I wasn't able to slip the gear on the crank;
they &quot;froze&quot; to the crank almost immediately after they touched the
crank and I had to get out my torch and heat them up to pull them off.

Has anybody done this before, and can give me some hints as to how it's 
done?

TIA.
