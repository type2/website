Subject: Re: [T2] CD Player Recommendations

i recently added a JVC cd player to my 71, although it was close to the right 
dimensions i did have to cut the opening in my dash a bit.  I used a jig saw 
with a metal blade, and it cut like butter, easier than i expected.. if you 
go this route i would recomend putting masking tape on your dash first so the 
saw legs dont scratch your dash.. thats my 2 cents.. hope you get your 
tunes.. peace 
scott-- 71 vesty.
