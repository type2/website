Subject: Spark Plugs!!

Trying to get my spark plugs out...as all can tell I am doing my first tune 
up and don't know sh** from applebutter...am I doing something wrong...I have 
the extension and the sparkplug adapter...it just is not going down there 
very easily...so I went on to pulling my distributor and replaced my points 
and condensors...any help on the spark plugs would be great...Thanks...Adam

**Saw a Green Splitty from Massachusetts today....didn't get a chance to say 
hello..but they had that beauty packed to the brim..._dot_can't wait to hit the 
road in August...
