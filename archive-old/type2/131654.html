Subject: West Coast Core

I am looking for a new set of Pistons and Cyllinders 1700, Type IV. These 
guys seem to have the best price for them that I found. $239.95 + Shipping. 
They are said to be Mahle or aa. I have also emailed someone on the samba 
who has a set of Cofaps for $200 + Shipping. Both deals &quot;sound&quot; good but I 
just wanted to see what experiences you all might have had.

Questions are:

Who is aa?
Has anyone out there had any experience with West Coast Core?
Generally how do Cofap P/Cs stand up to Mahle?
What about Mahle to aa?
