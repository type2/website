Re using concrete block as &quot;jackstand&quot;

&gt; Mike, I respectfully disagree... and this is important.
&gt; Do not use anything that used to be sand and gravel or clay to do
&gt; anything but support the roof over your head. 
&gt; Concrete blocks will work until they fail without warning. It ain't *if*, it's *when*. Most of all laid flat. Concrete blocks are engineered to take static compressive loads with the holes in them oriented vertically.
OK, I agree, Jim, but by &quot;flat&quot; I mean use them with the THREE (not 2)
holes vertical (as they are laid in a wall), and don't doubt they can
take the vertical load if one has wood above the holes to spread the
contact point over the block.  Also, the blocks left over from building
our house were cap blocks, which are solid on one face and have the
holes opposite. Side to side rocking with this is nil compared to
jackstands.  I don't intentional apply side loads once they are in
place.  I still leave the jack in place for the side I'm working on. 
Now I have jackstands, and will use a block as insurance if I gotta move
the jack.
