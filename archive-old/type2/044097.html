Subject: Re: [T2] Shipping a Trans

Have you removed the convertor and whatever mounts may be on the tranny to 
consider shipping them separately?

Check around to some of the other trucking services. RPS comes to mind. 
They will have different rates and different weight limits.

Let us know what you do.

&gt;Hello All,
&gt;   I am needing some help. I found an automatic trans for another listee and
&gt;I need to ship it to him. The problem is that the trans and converter weigh
&gt;175lbs with no box or wrapping, just bare trans. I know this has been
&gt;discused before, but I don't really remember qhat was said. I searched the
&gt;library (type2_dot_com) and the archives but I did not find much. It will be
&gt;going from Tacoma Wa. to Colorado. I need sugestions. UPS has a limit of
&gt;150lbs, US post office is around the same. Anyone going to Colorado? I think
&gt;money saved is more important than time. Please help.
