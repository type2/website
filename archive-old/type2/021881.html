Subject: re:leaking gas (yes i know its bad)

In behind the firewall are two tubes that are part of the fuel vapour
recovery system....each has a 3&quot; piece of 1/4&quot; connecting tubing(fuel
line) attaching them to the elbows on the tank.

Every bus I've seen over the last few years has needed to have these
short pieces of fuel line replaced..they have dried right out, and will
almost crumble when you go to take them off.

I save the two rubber connector lines and clips from the see through
aftermarket fuel filters that I use...they're 1/4&quot;, and fix the problem
nicely for the next 25 years.

Just my $.02...

Den.
