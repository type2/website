&gt;Does anyone have a picture of the top of their distributor?
&gt;  I have a broken ground wire and I need to see if it is repairable.
&gt;
You don't really need to look at a picture. You do need a ground wire
between the points's plate and the distributor body. If you don't have the
wire, you can still get your engine to run, although it will run poorly and
you will do damage to the distributor. The points must have very good (zero
ohms) electrical continuity with ground. If you don't have the wire, the
electricity has to flow through greasy bearings or bushings. The original
wire was an un-insulated, very flexible, braided wire that was spot welded
to the plate and to the distributor body. If you don't have a spot welder
; ). Then just make a replacement . Find a nice small inslulated wire, about
the same gauge as the braided wire, and strip the ends, before you pull the
cut insulation all the way off, twist the insulation to really make a nice
tight wind. Put a loop in the middle of the wire by wrapping it around a #1
phillips screwdirver. (this loop makes a nice flexible
get-longer-get-shorter bend) put one end under the points themselfs between
the points and the distributor plate. Put the other end on any convienent
screw on the distributor body. Think about how this wire has to fit. Stick
the rotor on and make sure you have lots of clearance from the spinning
rotor, move the points's plate back and forth and make sure the wire is not
stopping its rotation. I have repaired lots of distributors this way with no
problems. Usually the added wire lasts the life of the engine.
