Subject: Durham, NC AIRS update

Thanks to all the moral support and advice from NC
local and other type2 listees.  the '73 Penthouse
camper is doing much better now awakening from its 3
year slumber.  I spent yesterday morning replacing
front brake hoses which fixed the brake lockup problem.
 Then I drove to Raleigh (successfully!) and spent a
few hour$ over at Transporterwerks, Gary and Sean put
the bus on a lift and looked over it for me (Since I
don't know T4 buses) and diagnosed general condition,
good for peace of mind.  I bought from them a pair of
nearly-new 185R14C tires to replace the old dry-rotted
Michelins, and they ride a lot better too.

The Dead show was fantastic last night, Branford
Marsalis sat in.  Today we are headed for Charlotte,
and Atlanta after that.

I just wanted to give y'all the update, I am grateful
for all of the AIRS response, it is nice to know who is
out there, even though I didn't end up needing to
borrow tools, I am glad that assistance was available.

Sarah's bus is still for sale on thesamba, and its
mechanical condition is improving every day and the 2L
runs GREAT and cool.  Asking price dropped to $2k and
will take offers.

thanks,
Will A.
