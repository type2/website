&gt;Thanks, Joe, but it was a responce relating to vehicles which have been
&gt;sitting for several years and came out generic for all types. Obviously if
&gt;you have a cable clutch there is no need to address this other than
&gt;inspection for fraying, lubrication and adjustment. 

Don't push the clutch in too vigorously the first time, and don't yank on
the handbrake.  I've seen both broken because they were frozen in the sheath.
