Subject: I have a running  bus!

Hey all! I am so excited. I spent the evening helping my friend install my 
newly rebuilt engine. It runs great! Tomorrow or Saturday we'll run it a bit 
and adjust the valves. Did I mention that I'm so excited??!!
I do need  lots of new bulbs for the dash, and a new master cylinder. I also 
have some lights issues, but I'm feeling like that's not a big issue, I hope. 
Anyway, just needed to share my excitement with people who can relate!
