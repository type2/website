Timing light essential
Fuel pressure before FI touble shoot.
The fuel pump relay runs off the ignition side of the starter so I would
look there first .
You have spark but Maybe you dont have fuel.
Put your hand on the pump while someone else turns stater , you should feel
it runing.
Good luck
Brian

&gt; Volks:
&gt;
&gt; I got a call last nite from a couple of bussers having trouble with
&gt; their 81 Vanagon.  Neither knows much about VW or autos for that matter.
&gt;
&gt; Symptoms:  Wouldn't start.  May have burned up the starter trying.
&gt; Starter has been replaced.  Then, while driving noticed a loss of power.
&gt; Backed off the accelerator and it regained power.  They had a non-VW
&gt; mechanic &quot;adjust&quot; the timing.  Ran well, then sputtering/losing power
&gt; again.  Now it won't start. Starter working intermittently.
&gt;
&gt; I'm trying to talk them thru as much as possible before I drive 2
&gt; hours.
&gt;
&gt; So Far:
&gt;
&gt; Battery o.k.  Starter works most of the time.
&gt; It has spark.
&gt; I've got them trying to adjust the timing (without a timing lite).
&gt; Fuel Filters o.k.
&gt;
&gt; I don't know much about the Type IV.  Is there anything they should
&gt; immediately check before trying to troubleshoot the FI system?
&gt;
&gt; Please respond B/C.  I'm on Digest Mode.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
