Subject: Ign, switch &amp; alignment clues

     Lea's '63 single cab has been acting up.  Weeks ago I had to rewire 
     the entire system involving lights (headlight, tailight, turn signal, 
     4-way flasher, brakelight) horn, and wipers.  When I was done 
     everything worked!  Last week I borrowed her bus for a day and noticed 
     that using anything above made the entire system go about 1/2 power.  
     I am NOT knowledgable about electrical stuff but I figured it was a 
     short of some sort.  I started looking for a ground problem but found 
     none.  While checking systems with the key in the accessory position I 
     noticed the key was warm, hmm.  I reached behind the ignition switch 
     to see if anything else was warm and burned the crap out of my finger 
     on one wire.  Fortunately there was a switch from my '66 laying in the 
     shop.  yep, that was it, a bum switch.  All systems are go now.
     
     The next event involved taking the '63 in to a &quot;professional&quot; mechanic 
     for an alignment.  When they were done, it tracked very nicely and the 
     steering wheel was straight!  The problem occurred that night when we 
     went out to dinner and found out in the parking lot at the restaurant 
     that the left turning radius was severely decreased.  You could turn 
     on a dime to the right but hardly anything to the left.  Apparently 
     that's how the wheel got straightened out.  Took it back yesterday and 
     waited for it while they gave us back the proper turning ability and 
     I'll live with a crooked steering wheel until I can take it off and 
     hopefully move it up top.  With the new tires, swing lever pin and 
     tierod ends it sure handles nice.
     
     Nothing earth shattering but it may help someone.  
     Ray
