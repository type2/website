Hi Volks!

&gt; Many of you may not be aware, but in North America you have a better chance
&gt; of finding a split window Single or Double Cab then finding a 72-79 SC or
&gt; DC. The 72-79 pick-ups were never brought into North America, due to
&gt; regulatory reasons. So where is the best place to search for one? Mexico,
&gt; UK, etc...

Germany, probably.  They are getting rarer here too, but if you're
willing to pay a good price, I'd say you stand a pretty good chance
of finding one.  I think they're still under-valued here.  And unlike
other European countries, there are quite a few former public service
pickups around here (military, red cross, fire department, etc.), 
which tend to be in better condition than your average building site
pickup truck (which is what they used to be here).

They're still rarer than panel vans or Kombis by at least an order
of magniture, though.

Note however that through '79, German pickups all had the 1600 cc, 
50 bhp Type 1 engine.  Type-4-engined pickups were available abroad
(like e.g. the Netherlands), but never in Germany.

Airhowlingly yours, 
   Erik.
