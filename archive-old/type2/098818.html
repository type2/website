Subject: Re:  Friday xmas report

&gt;Oh the horror, the horror. My mom gave my 4.5
year old son one of those Barbie VW microbusses, 
at least it's blue and not one of the pink
ones...

What the heck is wrong with one of those busses? 

I got one and it was the highlight of my
Christmas gifts.  

Peel the Barbie stickers off, remove the middle
seats (you'll need a blade or screwdriver) and
get to working on a camper interior (posterboard
and felt?).   No Barbies will be around it of
course.  If I get real ambitious,  I may paint
mine like Snoopybus or Robbie Henley's bus or
perhaps put a poptop on it.

Those things are fairly tough.  My 15 mo old has
been riding on top of it.  

I'm also getting far more used to the New Bus
styling.  Didn't like it at first, and I'd still
prefer round headlights, but I do kinda like this
thing now.
