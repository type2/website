Jeff-
use more heat ( dull red plus )
then reassemble with silver
anti-sieze (and then go back and do the
other side.) also good for the small bolts
that attach the drum to the hub.

Subject: [T2] Stuck Rear Brake Adjuster


Hey Folks,
   &lt;Sigh&gt; Is nothing easy? I've encountered this on every VW I've ever owned,
but always managed to break them free. Heeding the advice I got over the
weekend to adjust my rear brakes, I did the right rear and all went well.
Left side, no go. The star adjusters appear to have become one with the piece
they fit into. I have tried: Liquid Wrench, heat, and vice grips-they still
won't budge. It also appears to have been this way for some time, as the
shoes on this side show almost no wear, as they are turned almost all the way
in. Any suggestions on how to get these $#_at_&amp;!  things unstuck? TIA,      Jeff
S.
