Subject: RE: [T2] Westy need seatbelts in NJ? 

Rogelio said:

&gt;&gt;is not illegal since it is older than 25 years
&gt;&gt;and according to federal law it doesn't have to meet EPA nor DOT 
&gt;&gt;regulations...


Rogelio, thanks for the update on everything.  I attempted a bit of humor, 
and guess I failed.

Since it took our state, Virginia, FOREVER to exempt vehicles over 25 years 
just from emissions, I am surprised that federal law says the over 25 
vehicle does not have to meet DOT regulations.   or is that a 'real special' 
blend we are smoking...  &lt;&lt;--  humor, really...

Barry in Virginia with no more Virginia emissions but Virginia safety 
inspection if I want a daily driver on the road here.  (Like me, my VWs are 
over 25; like me, my VWs occasionally leak; like me, my VWs like to have 
their oil changed)
