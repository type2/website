Subject: Trade '79 for '78 (Westies)

Hello all!
I'm pondering trading my '79 Westy for a '78 Westy.
I need some feedback from other VWers.
Here are the differences:
Exterior:My '79 has a dark brown, partially rusted exterior +2 dents
         The '78 has a minimal amount of surface rust
Interior:'79-more int. lights, bigger stand-up fridge, coleman 
cabinet-mount heater, aux. batt., door-mount stove
         '78-side mount smaller fridge, no aux. batt., built-in stove
Tranny:'79-Manual
        '78-Auto(this is a plus because my wife doesn't like to drive 
stick, at least not a car stick)
Engine:This is the most confusing catagory.  Why, you ask?  If they both 
have 2.0lt FI engines, why the confusion?  I'll tell you why.
my '79 has a standard 2.0 FI, but the '78 has a 2.0 which the current 
owner had fitted with a carb.  The eng. compartment of the '78 is so 
clean you could eat off of it, the engine sparkles and the carb LOOKS
great, but you never know...
Anyway, anybody have any helpful info?  Anybody done FI to carb. 
transformations??
Ernie
'79 Westy(maybe not for long)
