&gt; I had the same experience with trying to get help from the guys at Bus
&gt; Depot.  They just told me to follow the directions.  I called three times
&gt; (never spoke to Ron) and every time I was told to follow the directions.
&gt; They aren't very good and I haven't figured out how to load these on a bay.

What do the flaps and brackets look like? I suspect the flaps have a
familiar look but the brackets we added after the mudflaps were obtained.

I have some photos of the stock brackets. It's a two piece system. Do they
match?
