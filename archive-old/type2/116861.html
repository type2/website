Subject: Re: [T2] DIY Paint

&gt;How many cans of spray did it take to do the white?

Alot. It was probably about 100 or more worth or primer and paint, and i 
used the cheap stuff. Looking back, it would have been better to use a 
better quality paint but you have to pay for it.

What the other guy said of 40 cans sounds a little high, but it was 
definately in that neighbor hood. Also, looking back i should have used 
rustolem and a brush like i did the blue, the blue is shinyer and looks alot 
better than the white.
