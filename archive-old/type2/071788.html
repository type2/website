Subject: Auto trans with 1600cc motor ?
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Has anyone used a bus auto trans with a 1600cc motor

In the USA they only were offered with type 4 motors

were they offered with 1600cc upright motors in Europe

which flex plate would you have to use on the 1600cc motor  ? type 3 ?

thanks for your help.......
