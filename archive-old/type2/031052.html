&gt; The &quot;slowly, slowly&quot; part got significanly accelerated when, about a week

&gt; 
&gt; The GEX surprise is...  I emailed the President of GEX about my engine's 
&gt; self-destruct after only 28,000 well-cared for miles and he agreed to 
&gt; replace the destroyed parts and/or take the engine back for repair!!!!!  
&gt; I haven't done anything about this yet since I've been busy, and I'm not 
&gt; yet sure what I'll do, but after all the GEX-bashing that's gone on I was 
&gt; surprised, to say the least, at GEX's response.

this is more or less the standard response, you send them the engine or
parts (usually at your expense) they tell you it will cost you $XX to get
it back because you did XXXXX (usually allowed to overheat) and they say
that the part you sent is not what you say you sent.

The only way I beat them in court was because I still had the defective
part and affidavits from mechanics who swore that they were defective, and
not what was advertised

&gt; I'll let you know how this all works out.

I do hope you prove me wrong though
