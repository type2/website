Subject: Re: Corvair engine installation

Hi;

Two things, I recently posted an add I saw for a bus with a corvair
engine in it in the Deleware Maryland area which would be a good deal
for anyone who wanted to go that root.  If anyone wants to get that add
again please e-mail.
2: We have working factory air in our '78.  It works great, better then
the heat.

&gt; corvair engine in thier bus.  I would love to have one in mine and have
&gt; heard nothing but good things about this type of installation.  If
&gt; anyone can lead me to a good webpage or person to talk to i would be
&gt; very grateful.  Thank you
