Vincent,

Here is some data

1972 bus 083257 built in December 1971 odometer is located in the upper
portion of the speedo.
1969 bus 191625 built spring 1969 odometer is located in the upper portion
of the speedo.

I noticed by looking at your webpage that you are European. Is your
speedometer in Kilometers of miles per hour? That may be the difference.

I also wanted to ask you about the bus on your webpage that is white over
green. It has turnsignal lenses that appear to be from a split screen bus.
Is this a custom item or a Euro spec?
