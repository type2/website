Subject: Re: Type 2 Karma/Holiday Spirit---free bumpers

    HoHoHo:  I finally got the right bumpers for my '77, and have a pair of 
dee-luxe chrome ones up for grabs.  These are in average condition, with a 
slight tweak in the rear.  Only caveat:  I robbed the rubber pieces from 
them, which reveals some rusty spots in the grooves.  Free if anybody wants 
'em, and please don't make me ship them.  I'm in SoCal.

P.S.  If there are any secret Santas out there, I need a straight passenger 
side rear bumper bracket---will gladly pay. 

Best to all, Matt Q.  Laguna Beach
