&gt; Mahle cylinders aren't real good quality, the top fins often break off.

I thought Mahle was the best you can get currently, especially 2l stock

&gt; Just a piece here and there and it isn't enough to make any major
&gt; difference in dissipating heat.

yeah that is fact, you might want to clean up the edges and &quot;Relieve&quot; them
so the chip or crack doesn't spread and to take off the rough edges so you
don't cut yourself on em 

&gt; Run the cylinders: a new set of four is only 224$. If you;ve got genuine

where you find em at that price, the best price I could find for Mahle
couple years ago was $350

&gt; VW that is a $460.00 set.
