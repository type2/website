As I am painting the bus, I am going to do the inside also. If you look at
the breakfast picture on my web page, then you will see why!

Although well made the conversion was obviously a &quot;one-off&quot; or at least not
a mainstream conversion. The windows are smaller than usual &amp; are double
glazed, great for warmth (&amp; cooling) but don't let much light in. This is
made worse as the cabinets are made from 1/2&quot; Plywood that has been
varnished/stained to a dark mahogany.

Any ideas for chip/water resistant paint? Or should I use a Vaneer?
On my Mini's dash I used &quot;stoneflec&quot; by &quot;plasticoat&quot;. any experience with
interiors would be greatly appreciated. I have seen gloss oil paint used &amp;
even wall-paper! The finished article was very naff. HELP!
