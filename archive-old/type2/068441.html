Subject: Re: Is &quot;Lucas&quot; an American expression?

Over here on this side of the &quot;pond&quot;, Lucas received a bad reputation 
especially during the late 60s early 70s when the British car industry was 
consolodated into British Leyland. Electrical components were the bane of 
all British cars, causing MGs,Triumphs, Jags, etc. to spend (or seem to 
spend) more time in the shop than in the owner's hands.

There were a bunch of bumper stickers floating around in the US at that time 
(in fact one can still get them at British car shows):

LUCAS - Lord of Darkness

The English drink warm beer because LUCAS makes their refrigerators

LUCAS - The inventer of the three way switch - OFF - FLICKER - DIM
