Subject: Re: [T2] alternator wire identification

&gt; I have a 78 westy and I am trying to identify a wire

&gt;
&gt; There is a bundle of 4 wires that heads to the voltage
&gt; regulator.  Three of the wires go to the regulator, but
&gt; one of them is loose with a connector on the end.  Does
&gt; anyone know what this wire is for?  I thought it was for
&gt; the aux battery relay, but it doesn't seem correct because
&gt; it always has +12v, even when the car is not on.


sounds like the alt light on the daash, should go to a connector that
comes thru the firewall right below the voltage regulator
