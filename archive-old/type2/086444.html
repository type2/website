I think I am going to be moving to North Carolina soon.  Before I make th=
e journey from CA I want to replace the non-stock muffler on my non-CA 79=
 that is causing it to leak.  I would need the crossover pipe, cat, muffl=
er, gaskets, etc.  A very expensive project.  I am tempted to just buy a =
muffler from an earlier year and bolt it directly to the heat exchangers.=
  This will eliminate a lot of expensive parts.
Would I be getting myself into trouble by doing this? I know in CA it cou=
ld not legally pass smog like this.  (even though this is the setup I cur=
rently have (but the muffler is from midas or some place that doesn't kno=
w anything about vws) and the bus passed smog)  Is any one familiar with =
emissions laws else where in the country?  I am specifically interested i=
n North Carolina, but I never know where I might end up.
Thanks,
Kyle    =20
