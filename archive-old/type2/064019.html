    &gt;Between Arizona and Louisiana there is nothing to see [except] Grand
    &gt;Canyon...next stop
    &gt;New Orleans..
    
    Oh, quit. There is, too.
    

great list.

add Chaco or Mesa Verde, Arches National Monument and 
Dead Horse Mesa (State Park) and there certainly is
a good bunch.

for an adrenalin thrill, sleep on the floor of the 
river in Moab but watch for flashfloods!...
