Subject: Re: Northern engine stand

I purchased a stand at a garage sale that is probably similar to the one you
bought.  There are a lot of knock offs out there that seem to be subtle
variations on the same theme.  If you go to buy one new, they usually tell
you somewhere in the fine print that they do not fit VW.  Don't despair.  If
you have a grinder, you can make it work.  I think I had to relocate some of
the holes on the flat portion of the adjustable tangs, and grind away enough
of the tubes to clear the flywheel.  Works just fine now.  I love being able
to work on the engine at hip height, and the freedom of being able to roll
it to where ever I need to in the shop.  The stand itself also disassembles
quickly for compact storage.

The difficulty I'm having is getting the engine on and off of the stand.  My
floor jack doesn't lift high enough to reach the stand, and extra bodies for
lifting are hard to come by at the hours I keep.  I do have a chain hoist,
but I haven't figured out a good way of rigging a cable onto the engine that
doesn't involve a lot of gymnastics I would like to avoid.

Ideas anyone?
