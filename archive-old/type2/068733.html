&gt;Many of us guys learned to drive when our hormones were raging.  I remember
&gt;learning to drive with one hand (hold the wheel with my knee while I 
shift!)
&gt;but the other one wasn't for the horn unless I was alone in the car.

&gt;(bet this gets some flames!)

&gt;where was she sitting? between you and the drivers door?
&gt;either that or you must be really &quot;limber&quot;!

When I learned this, I handled the wheel, with the left hand, and the pedals 
with my feet. Other hand checked the oil.
She handled both sticks;-)
Takes a while to learn to shift together, especially double clutching
downshifts.
