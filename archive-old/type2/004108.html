&gt; By the way, The stuff in the bags labeled with the brand name &quot;TSP&quot; isn't
&gt; really tri-sodium-phosphate!  It's some substitute cleaning agent that
&gt; doesn't contain phosphates.  Phosphates are an ecological bogeyman because
&gt; they are a terrific fertilizer and tend to promote plant growth in
&gt; waterways that have sewage dumped into them, so don't do that.
&gt;
&gt; _Real_ TSP is available and is the preferable material.  It is usually
&gt; found in white bags right next to the brand name ersatz &quot;TSP&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; Dispose of the cleaning solution by allowing it to sit and cool, then skim
&gt; the oil from the surface.  The remaining liquid can be poured on your
&gt; lawn, which will love it.  Be sure to spread it around over a large areas
&gt; so the grass won't OD on the fertilizer!
&gt;
&gt; If you have bare metal parts, don't forget to primer them before you paint
&gt; them!  Unless it's special stuff, the finish paint will not stick well to
&gt; the bare metal
