Subject: Re: [T2] '76 FI engine?

I apologize for my incorrect posting.  I had my 1776 that I just got
finished recently in my mind.  My screw up.

And believe it or not a few listees that will go nameless had to pmail with
the rudest most cussing out for this mistake..................

I feel that my posts and help I give are generally helpful.  It is a shame
that a few faceless cowards resort to using the internet to talk to another
listee in  a manner that they would not do face to face, or, trust me, they
would be spitting teeth.

&gt;
&gt; HUH???
&gt;
&gt; Apparently I've been doing the impossible all these years...  And has
&gt; anyone EVER seen a T4 hydraulic (or solid for that matter) lifter that
&gt; was mushroomed anywhere.  Now this informations is pretty much
&gt; true for a type 1 engine, though I'd still be amazed about a hydraulic
&gt; type 4 retrofit lifter (which is what my local guy installs) mushroomed
&gt; that far, maybe those crappy slip in T1 lifters.
&gt;
&gt; We aren't talking apples and oranges here volks the topic of this is the
&gt; '76 TYPE 4 engine.  You can pull any T4 lifter at any time you darn well
&gt; please boys and girls after merely pulling the pushrod tubes.  You can
&gt; even do it on waterboxers but unless you buy expensive collapsible
&gt; tubes you can't replace those without pulling the head.  Anyway I don't
&gt; want anyone getting confused here with incorrect information.  You can
&gt; in fact retrofit hydraulics ON TOP of the ole solid lifter cam though some
&gt; will warn of this, many have done it and are happy enough with the
results.
&gt; You need to secure all of the hydraulic valve train including pushrods,
&gt; solid rocker spacers, etc. in order to do so.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway for informative hints on the T4 valvetrain please reference
