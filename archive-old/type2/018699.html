Just went through the same thing myself. The brake servo draws its vacuum off
of the #1 &amp; #3 cylinders. There should be two &quot;pipes&quot; coming from the intake
manifold, each with an L-shaped rubber bootie. Check those. The booties connect
to a pipe arrangement that exits through the foreward bulkhead, check the hose
connection on the other side of the bulkhead. That's where my problem was (hose
disconnected) and as far as I can help you.

Good luck.
