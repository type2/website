	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

&gt;At the base of the steering column is a (was a) hard plastic
(Bakelite?)
&gt;that holds (held) the base of the column steady. Does any one
have one
&gt;or know where to locate a replacement?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,

funny, I just found a crusty one on my 77 yesterday.
I am glad that I checked it, it could have been a disaster.

List, do you think I could replace it with plywood for a temp
fix, or should it flex?
If yours was hard, maybe I could use plywood.
Mine seemed to be rubbery, or at least at one time, maybe 20
years ago. : )

Peace,
