Subject: Re: [T2] turn signal/dimmer switch

Must be something in the air...while making a sharp turn, shifting gears, 
and using the blinker, I (being 6'3&quot;) hit the blinker arm with my left knee 
and broke the arm off.

Dumb luck, or has anyone else ever done anything like that?

&gt; &gt;Does anyone out there have a turn signal/high beam
&gt;switch for a 1972 westie.
&gt;
&gt;Hello Kurt
&gt;
&gt;If I'm not mistaken this is another One year only part for our 72 busses, I
&gt;believe 71 had a different setup and 73 went to a new model.
&gt;
&gt;I believe you can use a 71 you just have to wire it a bit different, not
&gt;sure how though since I've not done it.
&gt;
&gt;I still want to make a list of all the one year only parts for a 72, also
&gt;all of the last year changes and first year changes, I believe it has to be
&gt;more than any other model, of course this is probably a Friday subject!
&gt;
&gt;Good luck!
&gt;
&gt;Meredith
