&lt;&lt; Anyone out there have any exp. fitting dual webers to1600tp engine?-any 
help gratefully accepted-Martin &gt;&gt;

I ran a pair of 40 IDF's on a 1600 and was quite satisfied with their 
performance. They aren't as reliable or &quot;drivable&quot; as fuel injection but they 
were OK.

Both the Haynes and HPBooks Weber manuals list them as the appropriate 
conversion kit for the 1600, though I believe the folks at aircooled_dot_net feel 
that the 40 IDF is a bit small for the 1600 with 28mm venturis.

These two manuals suggest starting with a 50 idle, 115 main, and 200 air 
correction jets.

Aircooled_dot_net recommended 55 idle, 115 main and 200 air correction jets.

My notes indicate the local shop set me up with 55 idle, 115 main, and 180 
air correction jets.  I kept the 28mm venturis.

Run them with a dual advance distributor for best performance and fuel 
economy; correct float settings are_critical_to their smooth operation.  
Resist the temptation to install a whiz-bang, &quot;performance&quot;, electric fuel 
pump.  They typically put out enough pressure to unseat the float valves 
which requires installation of a pressure regulator.  You also have to wire 
in a pump relay so that you don't become a torch if someone ever collides 
with you.  Tap one of the manifolds with a suitable diameter fitting for the 
brake booster.

They do a take a while too warm up, cold starts are rough; they are loud; the 
quality of linkages varies significantly.  My personal preference is fuel 
injection over the webers, check out:

The 40 IDF's currently on my ghia will be replaced with it when I have some 
time this summer for the conversion.
