&gt;I have replaced all the gaskets hoses on air distributor and still have vacuum
&gt;around 15.2 inHg. I suspect the gasket between the runners and the cylinder
&gt;head. I will check with carburetor cleaner before I go through your whole
&gt;exercise.

Maybe it's not tightened up right?

&gt;This is the gasket between the runner tubes and the cylinder head? What I have
&gt;been referring to as the intake manifold gasket. My new gaskets are some sort
&gt;of plastic/bakelite material with graphite coated paper on the outside.

This is what mine looked like:

Old vs. new:

&gt;I am assuming the mallet was to get the runner tubes into the rubber hoses
&gt;(boots). When I put them on the first time, I had to remove the air
&gt;distributor. It was really tuff putting then on by hand.

The mallet is for the seating everything against the head.

Getting the intake runners into new boots and seating the gasket is sometimes a lot of work, twisting, seating etc. You have to put them on the plenum and push the intake runners in to get them started then use a twisting action to completely seat them.  It shouldn't be easy if you are expecting to raise your vacuum level.

&gt;My injectors have new gaskets and new hoses, but I think I will remove them
&gt;just to get them out of the way.

This is how much stuff I left connected getting the runner into place:
