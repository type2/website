Subject: Re: [T2] 120V GFI in 71 Westy?

  A campsite should have a 15 amp curcuit breaker at the box anyway, so
you should be protected against overload.  If  you are using a 30 amp
adaptor to your 110 wire, (I use it if other outlets are taken),  then
you should have your own 15 amp breaker.  Yes, most power strips have a
built in curcuit breaker- I use one, laying it on the floor in front of
the rear bedseat.  Try to find one with a flush laying plug.  Regarding
replacing your stock breaker, I bet it's one you can find at Home depot
if you take the outlet box apart and see its shape.  As for ground fault
protection, you can buy plug in adaptors that convert a double plug to
one with the GFI included; plug it into the campground box first.  These
tend to trip if there is a power failure. Not sure a GFI outlet will fit
into the box in the Westy; they are fairly bulky.

&gt; I've looked through the archives, and the concensus seems to be that the little button next to the 120V outlet is a circuit breaker.  Unfortunately the button on mine has long since broken off making resetting a little difficult.  My question is: Can I simply install a GFI outlet instead, and just exclude the breaker altogether?  If not, does anyone know of a source for a replacement breaker?
