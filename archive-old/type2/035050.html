Hey Y'all
Progress on the Dormobile (update)
I took all the clearance out of the Oil pump last night - A Tombstone
(flat granite) 600 grit wet/dry water and a really boring movie.  The
face side of the pump is so shiny you can comb your teeth in it.  Should
be 0 clearance + the gasket thickness.  Today was install the alternator
to the cleaned out and painter fan shroud.  I had boiled the shroud in
TSP in a plastic garbage barrel.  Worked the nuts for degreasing!  The
fan shroud is now the same color gray as my 76 BMW R75/6 because that's
what color paint I had.  Got the halfmoons today so I'll be finishing
the CV joint project.  The engine bits are at the balancers.  The whole
rotating assembly gets balanced,  Flywheel loses 5 lbs.  Rods get
rebuilt, long and short pistons get matched with short and long rods.
Next week is size out bearings, tap for full flow oil filter, and begin
reassembly. I get to mount the freshly rebuilt carb on the smoothed out
intake tract.   Damn I was thinking this part would never get here.

Yeah I know it looks like the recipe for a massive &quot;why won't my bus go&quot;
post huh?

Dave
