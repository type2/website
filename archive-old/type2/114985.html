Subject: Re: [T2] Brake cylinder pistons

Seems like a typical bill.

&gt; After he got home, he pulled the
&gt; drum and saw that the cylinders were still rusty and greasy. He contacted
&gt; the owner, Gary, and was told that the wheel cylinders are no longer
&gt; available, but that he replaced the pistons. Gary does not seemed inclined
&gt; to refund all or any portion of the money.

More like the other way around: the pistons are unavailable but the complete
unit still is. You have to wonder where he got those parts from if he's even
telling the truth. Sounds like he was too lazy to bleed the system or forgot
and lied.

In curious to know how much each piston cost?

&gt;   This sounds like BS to me, but I wanted to know if anyone has heard of
&gt; just replacing the pistons in the wheel cylinders.

It's possible but generally (and the list mechanics can correct me), small
parts like that easier to replace than rebuild. Also, when parts fail, the
part vendor is liable and pays for the labor to replace it. This is why
shops usually don't accept customer supplied parts: it just ruins the
already shaky bond of trust between the shop and the customer who forked
over $300 the first time.

Does he offer a brake shoe relining service?
