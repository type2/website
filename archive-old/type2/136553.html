Well lets look at this monster. Yours is a FI bus which needs a few
things to run like the champ it really is. A solid vacuum system with
no leaks, good solid electrical connections and a solid fuel delivery
system. It could be an ignition issue, but I would shy away from that
being the cause until the fuel system has been completely checked,
besides diagnosing a intermittent problem in the ignition system sucks
:)

When was the last time the fuel pump filter was changed? You might
have an issue with something plugging the pump that caused that severe
engine dip/surge. The very best way to completely diagnose the FI
system is to go get the few tools you need to check the system, then
follow every step in the Bentley FI section to a tee, something will
not check out.

BTW, my guess is you still have a vacuum leak of some sort, what is
the vacuum reading on the engine at idle?
