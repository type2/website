&gt; &gt; Why would anyone want to mount thier bike on the front anyway .. why
not 
&gt; &gt; just mount it on the rear?

OK Guys, my turn on front mount bike racks.. My biggest gripe with a rear
mount bike rack is that ya can't open the back hatch with the rack full of
bicycles!  And you need to get into the rear cubbies every time you need a
quart of oil or some such..

Anyway, the link below leads to a bumper mount bike carriers that I intend
to use on my '81 Vanagon Camper, that is after the engine rebuilt.  This
particular bike rack clamps onto the bumper and comes in two versions.  In
the first version, the support posts extend straight up from the front edge
of the bumper, the second version has an offset to allow clearance for a
spare tire.  The link below goes directly to a manufacturer's catalog and
you will have to manually go to pages 4 and 5 for the products in question.


JC Whitney used to list them, but I haven't seen them recently.  A Google
search for the model numbers brought up a number of sites that sell these
racks, so you shouldn't be a problem in finding them.

Manufacturer:  ACAR Industries, Inc.
Model Number:
31-8       Mounts on a &quot;C&quot; channel bumper, has no offset,  
31-8V-3  Mounts on a &quot;C&quot; channel bumper, has offset for spare tire.
