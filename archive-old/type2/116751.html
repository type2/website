Subject: RE: [T2] ball joint booty

While new boots are available, installing them involves disassembly of the
joint.

Here is an option that may be suitable provided your ball joint(s) is/are
not excessively worn.  Thanks to listee J. Delecki for the idea.

I removed the hex shaped plastic plugs on top of the ball joints and
replaced them with zerk (grease) fittings as per the procedure in Bentley.
I then injected (using my grease gun) lots of grease to flush out as much
crud as possible from the joint.  After cleaning the dirty grease off, I
wrapped the joint with a strip of rubber cut from an inner tube, overlapped
the ends and glued them together with Pliobond (super strong contact
cement).  I injected some more grease after completing the wrapping process,
and declared victory.  This seems to be holding up very well so far, and the
front end is noticably quieter when going over bumps.

Of course, if your joints are excessively worn, replacement is the only safe
option.

Can you replave the ball joint rubber boot without going through that crazy
process that Mike Gensler lists on the type2 library?

I think the front right ball joint is making noise, and when I checked, the
boot is all torn and missing any grease. Is that a sign I need to replace it
completely, or can I somehow repack it with grease and slap a new boot on
there somehow?

thanks!
