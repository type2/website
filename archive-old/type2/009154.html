sorry, missed a bit of info.  its a 71, stock everything, i think.    1600cc 
single port, there is a wire missing on the right side of the carb at the 
top.  looks like it has something to do with the idling.  but not sure.  bye 
the way thanks a lot for all the quick responses.  i am going to put on a 
different carb in the morning and see if that makes any difference.  along 
with checking compression if i can find the tools.  also sometimes when im 
driving i can only get it to 45 tops.  which wouldnt be so bad i guess but 
the usual top speed was 75 to 80.  not that i should or will be going quite 
so fast in a bus, just had to test it out.  but after about half an hour of 
driving it goes back up and i drive at about 60 with a bit more room to go 
on the gas.  ok thanks again.  one way or the other i am getting home with 
the bus.                   -doug
