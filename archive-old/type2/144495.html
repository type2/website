Hello VW World!
 
Not that I'm a big contributor (only when asking a question or am able to lend help), but thought I would serve notice that I am taking off on a 2+ week vacation out West, from Kansas City.
 
I mention this only because I will be driving (and camping, naturally) in my '74 Westfalia Weekender. I've made several shorter trips through this summer, but I will be putting on more than 2600 miles of 60-65 mph driving.
 
I have a full set of instruments (oil pressure, oil temp &amp; CHT gauges) to help me spot trouble before it arrives. I will be online at points (WIFI card) and will have access to the AIRS list (which I am on).
 
I don't anticipate any trouble, but if any of you cross-country bussers have any helpful hints or insight, it would be greatly appreciated!
