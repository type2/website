&gt;Recently installed combination oil pressure/idiot light sending unit  in
&gt;place of the original oil pressure switch.  Noticed a slight leak,  removed
&gt;it,  and used some Teflon tape on the threads, then  reinstalled.  Very
&gt;frustrating! Still leaking!   I have 0 tolerance for leaks or rattles in/on
&gt;a bus.
&gt;
&gt;Read in the archives where Sean used some *Permatex* blue silicone on the
&gt;threads, and stopped the leak.  I am thinking of trying that, but,  was
&gt;wondering if it would be better to use a little *Fast Weld* epoxy putty on
&gt;the threads 


This reminds me of my leaking oilline fittings. I had leakage along the threads, 
used Permatex/Loctite 3H, the brown stuff, leaked. Then cleaned up and 
tried RTV sealant, leaked. Then my collegue (work at Porsche dealer) 
suggested using the green loctite, studlock, worked right away, no more leaks. 
The threads must be absolutely clean and free of oil.

Hope it helps,

Brian.
