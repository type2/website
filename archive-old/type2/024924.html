Regarding the painting of mufflers:

    I have had no problem with the paint burning off the muffler on my '65
split. It is a single quiet pack made by Empi and I haven't done anything with
the paint, the original paint is doing fine. However I have a set of headers
that the muffler has been attached to and the paint has burned off that, but
it's under the car and hidden so it's no big deal. So I suggest getting a header
system. The muffler and header together cost me only 85 bones.

Hi Michael, all,

&gt; I am soon to embark on installing a new (stock) muffler on my 1600Dp bus
&gt; engine (for 65' westy) are there any tricks or thingsthat I should watch
&gt; out for? Or is the install pretty starightforward and self evident?

I did this recently on my '66 and it was fairly straight forward.  The only
problem I had was getting the short fresh air tubes that stick up into the
engine compartment to fit into the little air-transfer bubbles on each side
of the muffler.  These are metal eggs about 5-6 inches in diameter that
send the engine-blower air down to the heater boxes.  I had to sand/file
the short tubes until they fit in the holes in the &quot;eggs&quot;.  This was probably
just a fit-n-finish problem, you may have no such problem.  (My muffler
is made by Leistritz.)

I also second all the items Thom mentioned although I didn't get the copper
nuts myself and I'll probably pay for that later :-( .
 
&gt; Also has anyone had any luck painting a muffler w/ grey paint that actually
&gt; stays on for any length of time. I suppose I good get the muffler powder
&gt; coated or something but that would cost more than a new muffler costs. Do
&gt; most people just give up and let the muffler rust?

This seems like a no-win situation to me.  You can have the muffler
powder-coated with &quot;high temperature silicon&quot; but you will probably pay
over $100 US to have this done.  Good German mufflers only cost about $60 US
and cheap ones only about $38 US so you could buy about two extra mufflers
for the cost of the powder-coating.  (Of course you have to factor in
installation labor costs...)

I had my heat-exchangers silicon powder coated and after 800 miles they
look like I just put 'em on.  My muffler, which I didn't powder-coat is
already showing loss-of-paint/rust around where the tail-pipe exits the
muffler.  This is Tucson, AZ so I expect the muffler will look rusty
but still last a long time.  I'm gonna powder-coat my next one.

Cheers,

 -Dyer
