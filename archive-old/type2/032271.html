Subject: Tools Power v. Air
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.4.10.10011011618270.25420-100000_at_comp.uark_dot_edu&gt;

Today I removed the {shredded rotten mildewy} canvas from the top of my 73
Westy that I just pulled out of storage.  High on the priority list of
things to do are fix the oil cooler seals and make the front brakes work -
but I couldn't resist doing something that wouldn't make me dirty this
afternoon before work.

As I'm about to step back into the VeeDubbin thing with full force, and as
I just bought a house with a {alas...one car} garage, I'm going to be
needing some cool tools to use.  I've considered buying an air compressor,
but I wonder if power tools would be a better choice.  It seems to me that
apart from blowing things (which you're not supposed to do), painting
things and airing things up, there's not much you can do with a compressor
that you can't with 120vac.  The compressor would take up real estate, and
you'd still have to pay high dollar for quality tools.

Do compressor tools work that much better than electric tools?
