I also have a 2k engine bolted to a 73 tranny with no problems.  There is
no difference at all in the engine, AFAIK.
&gt;
&gt;When I put a two liter in my '74, I was all ready to have to swap input
&gt;shafts and bellhousing etc., which my searching of the archive had
&gt;convinced me was necessary, but it went in without a hitch as it was.
&gt;Perhaps some listee has an extra of each style transmission that could
&gt;be set side-by-side on the garage floor and measured, hmm?

I do.  I already know that the bellhousing on the 091 tranny is about 1/2&quot;
bigger (deeper, whatever).  Unfortunately the 002 bellhousing is on the bus
at the moment, so I only have the two bare trannies to compare.  I just
measured them and the input shaft protrudes just under 5.5 inches from the
bellhousing/tranny mating surface on the 002 trans.  On the 091 the same
measurement is just under 6&quot;.  I would therefore conclude that with the
associated year bellhousing attached, the 002 and 091 transaxles are pretty
much  the same with respect to input shaft length, and are thus
interchangeable as far as bolting to the engine is concerned.  However, the
091 trans being 1/2&quot; longer than the 002, and the 091 bellhousing also
being 1/2&quot; longer than the 002 means that the whole 091 assembly is a good
inch longer than the 002.  This will possibly cause mounting problems, so
be careful.

&gt;Perhaps some apparent length of transmission problems could be the
&gt;consequence of year-to-year differences in the block of metal that bolts
&gt;to the frame, holding the two prongs on the nose cone to the frame.

Not sure about that one.  It would be nice if that were the difference
since it would be such an easy swap, but then you also have to worry about
the length of the shift rod.

&gt;On
&gt;some of them, at least, the holes are closer to one side than another
&gt;(also, some have indentations for the prongs, but this shouldn't show up
&gt;as a length problem).  So it could be just a matter of turning this
&gt;piece around 180 degrees.
&gt;
&gt;I was happy that I hit no snags in my transmission swap; but am curious
&gt;about what problems others had.

A while back I put the 091 trans in my bus with the 002 bellhousing
attached.  According to my measurements above, this would mean the input
shaft was sticking 1/2&quot; farther into the engine than it should have, but it
didn't seem to hurt anything.  I drove it that way for several thousand
miles.  H. Steve Dolan also has some experience with this stuff - I'd check
the archives.
