Subject: does anyone want

I am never going to put the middle bench
seat back in my '78, so I ask if anyone 
wants it.  This is the brown color, as in
for a two-tone bus of yellow-beige above
and brown below.  The seat is dirty, but
that is all.  I probably have the floor
brackets.

It's unwieldy to ship, of course, so perhaps
someone in New England (I'm in Boston) though
if you want to pay the shipping...
