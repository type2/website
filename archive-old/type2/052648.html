Subject: [T2] Copyright Theora

&gt; Based on what you said, I don't see how the archives itself is not a
&gt; republishing of the messages.  The way I see it is that when I post a
&gt; message, it is published to every subscriber.  If they retrieve it again via
&gt; the archives, they are having that message republished to them.

There is no case law on searchable list archives to my (limited) knowledge.

I'm comfortable with an archive that people can run searches into, in the
conventional internet sense of &quot;searches&quot;. Possibly even that will be held
to violate copyright law eventually, as intellectual property law becomes
increasingly surreal, but we can say these things about it at least:

--you knew about it when you subscribed

--it does not contradict any established intellectual copyright precedent

--not one single person, out of thousands of subscribers, has ever objected
to it even once

--thousands, possibly millions of internet fora do the same thing, and have
for a long time.

Given the awesome utility value of a searchable archive to the bus
community, then, I'm willing to take the small risk of serving it (I'm not
the only voice and if another admin objects, this can change).

A CD, though, clearly constitutes publishing, and we aren't going to do
that.
