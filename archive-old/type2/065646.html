Subject: leaky carb: Solex 34 PICT-3

I've got a '71 pop-top in which I'd like to put an original German Solex
34 PICT-3 carbuerator. The carb is not perfect, however, in that the
throttle shaft is loose where it goes throught the body of the carb on
one side. It tends to leak a little gas.

I'm told that this is a common problem with old 34 PICT-3s.

I know of one company, the Carberator Refactory in Richmond, Califonia,
that repairs these carbs by enlarging the whole the shaft runs through
and pressing in a bronze bushing. The shaft then runs through the
bushing, which is drilled to fit perfectly. I don't have the money to
buy a rebuilt carb from them, but I was thinking of having the bushing
put in by a local (Seattle) machine shop, then rebuilding the carb
myself.

Has anyone ever done this? The machine shop I spoke to said that I would
have to come up with the bushing myself, then they would figure out what
it would take to put it together.
