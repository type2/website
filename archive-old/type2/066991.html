Subject: Stainless Steel Exhaust/Muffler boxes

A couple of people have asked for more info...

Usual disclaimers of no commercial interest in this...

Prices are exclusive of VAT (UK sales tax - not payable for an export order) and
exclusive of shipping.

For a 1.6 (type 1 engine)
       Stainless Steel Power-Tourque Exhaust (Muffler)  
       cost 100 UK pounds (approx. $150 US)

For a 1.7 to 2.0 (type 4 engine)
       Stainless Steel Power-Tourque Exhaust (Muffler)  
       cost 160 UK pounds (approx. $240 US)

The tubing is slighlty larger than standard giving a claimed power increase of
2 or 3 HP for the 1.6 or 5 to 6 HP for the type 4 engine.

This is a replacement for the MUFFLER and tail-pipe only. (in 'Brit speak' 
this is the exhaust box - I'm sorry for missleading those who thought I ment 
heat exchangers but we invented this language:-)). I'm not sure how you would 
fit a catalytic converter into the system if you require it...I assume you 
would have to cut and weld the tail pipe which (larger diameter appart) are 
standard looking.

P.S.
When I just rung them for the price of the type 4 box they said they had none 
in stock and were waiting for them to be made. In this position 6 months ago I
had to wait 3 months for the type 1 boxes to be instock:-(
