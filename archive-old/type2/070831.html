Kids,

  Thinkin' to replace Ramona's fuel pump since I have noticed a lack of power
(getting worse), and the other day saw a think layer of gas covering the
right, top side of the pump cover.
  Called our little Small Car World, and Jim there said he had one for like
$15! Why does that sound so cheap to me?? I was expecting twice that, although
I have never replaced this part before...
  Oh! Also, this looks like a very easy job, but any pointers from the
Experienced would, as usual, be much appreciated!
Thanks!
