RE:     Copy of: That damn stool  8&lt;)

I know I'm beating this to DEATH but the reason that I, and just about everybody
else who's into VW's that I know, call it a stool and not a jumpseat, is that if
we called the stool a jumpseat, then what would we call the jumpseat?  8&lt;) 

Anyway you're Idea about putting the '76-'79 overhead rear cabinet in your '75
sounds like it just might work. Afterall,  the poptop layout is the same '74-'79
so that wouldn't be a problem. there is nothing on the right side of the westy
that would be a problem. the only problem may be the LR cabinet.  On my
'77deluxe, and '79 standard westy's ( both Tiaga/ Sage green) and on my '75
parts std. westy the LR cabinets both come up to the same height. the only
difference is that the '74-'75's had that brittle white plastic panel in the
rear overhead where the '76-'79's have the overhead cabinet. Since the '76-'79
overhead cabinet does not go over the LR cabinet, it only butts up against the
side, I believe it should work.  the only thing now is that you will have some
extra space showing above the LR cabinet since you will have removed the plastic
panel- extra storage space! ( if your plastic panel is crack free, then save it
- - they always break and someone may need a spare. )   I think an overhead rear
cabinet would make an interesting, useful addition to any '74-'75 westy as the
fake wood veneer is already the same, and so it would match very nicely.  I
really don't know why Westfalia-Werke waited until the '76 model to start doing
this. 

Good luck in your conversion, Patrick, and if you need any measurements off a
'76-'79 , then let me know.
