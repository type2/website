Subject: Re: [T2] ListServs and Pix

I too am on 56K at home where I actually download my mail - rather than just reading it like I do via webmail during the day. 

How about an option like Yahoo groups have where we the participants can choose to have the HTML messages or just plain text?

Frankly I'd still love to get the pics despite my slow connection. 

I typically start my mail download and walk in the other room to eat dinner. Keeps ANYBODY from calling during dinner (a pet peeve). 

Pic = thousand words really applies to our topics. 

Obviously there would have to be strict content rules and size limits (or the Type2 server could alter image size and quality before bouncing the messages back out to us regular folks). 

Chris
