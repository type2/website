Figure I'll jump into the fray here on sealants. There is a motorcycle sealant
called yamabond 4. Made especially for case halfs, stays semi-dry (not to be
confused w/yamabond3 which drys). Lets you leave the sledge hammer in the box
when rebuild time rolls around. Some of the porsche guys in my area swear by
it.O ya it's a yamaha product.
