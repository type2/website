Subject: Re: electrical blues

 &gt;My '78 westy is acting up.  First the stereo power came and went, then one
afternoon she wouldn't start. Finally got it running and made it 
home.  I heard
a clicking like a circuit breaker under the dash. Turn signals were erratic.
Now I've got nothing.  No lights, no start, no joy.

I took the battery out and had it checked and charged.  No difference.  The
 &gt;headlights won't even work.

Sounds like a loose connection or a faulty fuse. Check that your 
earth lead has a clean and secure connection to the body and if it 
has check where the connection from the +ve side of the battery joins 
to the starter solenoid. The next thing I'd look for is a 
loose/corroded/damaged fuse. I checked mine and found one making an 
intermittent connection (explaining a minor electrical fault) and 
another on the verge of failure. Ended up replacing them all as cheap 
insurance.

Good luck!

Martin.
