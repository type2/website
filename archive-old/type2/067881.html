Duh, some symptoms are the simplest problems: I can fix my idle by 
reaching down and lifting my accelerator pedal. I knew this was a problem 
in icy conditions, but summer? Can I tighten the spring or just soak 
something with WD-40?

Morris ('77 Camper) &lt;-- For some odd reason, I just had the urge to name 
my Bus &quot;Zeus&quot;. Would this be an unreasonable name? (BTW, my Bus is 
definitely male. Green, but definitely male.)
