&gt; In my bug, broke accelerator cable in a toll booth.  Sweet.
&gt;

many moons ago I was out with some friends in my Manx (VW based Dunebuggy)
and the accel cable broke in the middle of traffic. friend in back (no
seat) reached over the rear and pulled the accel on the side of the carb.
we drove about 10-15 miles with &quot;servo&quot; control of the accel.
