Subject: Everybus Grocery List

If you aren't attending Everybus 2002 in NC you can delete this one!

If you are however: The Full Moon Bus Club is again cooking their famous
breakfast burritos for the masses on Saturday morning.

Its free and all you have to do is show up with an appetite, but if you can
bring some food to donate please do!! Here is the official grocery list and
I will update it regularly.

You can just bring your food up to the cooking area on Saturday morning. We
can always use Coleman stoves and lots of pots and pans too.

Thanks and see you all in about 9 days!!
