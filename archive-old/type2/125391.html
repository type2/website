Subject: Fw: [T2] charcoal canister

I was just at the pick and pulls in Stockton and Modesto, and they have
cannisters for 10 bucks a pop.  Then just refill them yourself from time to
time.

BTW, there is a 69 bay westie at the Modesto, CA pick n pull, pretty beat
up, but the westy cabinets, zbed, and doors are in good shape, as well as
passenger door, some windows, etc..  I got some decent mirrors from it and
some retractor seat belts from the vanagaon westy
sitting next to it on this trip.

Cody
