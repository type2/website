Subject: Re: Towing Advice?

&gt;Just bought a '68 camper and need to have it towed home (approx 45 mi one
&gt;way) so we'll be doing the old UHaul and trailer bit I guess unless anyone
&gt;has a better/cheaper/safer idea?

You can pull some truly hair-raising towing stories out of the archive if
you apply yourself. 8) I'd agree with the others, get all the wheels off
the ground if you can. That bus exceeds UHaul's maximum by only about 1K
lbs and their people are supposed to watch for this so you will have to lie
to them and claim you're going to pull a Beetle if you want to rent the
trailer.

FWIW I have pulled a 6300# truck on one of those trailers for 500 miles
before and it worked okay if you don't mind speed wobbles. It smoked the
transmission in the Dodge tow vehicle but the trailer held up fine. Ask Joe
if I'm lying. =^ )
