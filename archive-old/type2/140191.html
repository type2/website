Subject: Re: [T2] Brake hoses changed

My wife would laugh hearing me say this,because Im a packrat and keep almost
everything,but you cant tell the condition of a brake hose,looking at it
from the outside.Second,if the other three are the same age as the bad
one,they were about ready to fail also.Third,by the time you have problems
with the new hoses you just put on,the old hoses will have been laying in
your garage for another ten yearsand when it comes to brakes,I wouldnt put
any faith in them.In my opinion,you can cut corners anywhere on a car except
the brakes.If the engine quits,you dont go anywhere.If the brakes quit you
put yourself and others including your precious bus into harms way.So in
this case Id probably save them cause Im a packrat,but if I ever needed a
new brake hose,Id buy a new brake hose.Oh when brake hoses fail,they dont
really clog.They collapse.Since the master cylinder is larger tahn your
wheel cylinders,it can pump fluid to the wheel cylinders ,but since the
wheel cylinders are so small when the line collapses internally,they cant
pump the fluid back out,so your brakes stick.Congrats on getting all that
brake work done.It feels good to stop.
