X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Hey all,
  This Bus that I am going to buy will be needing a windsheild. I just did
some calling and found National Auto Glass will replace it for $148.13. They
replace the glass, windsheild wipers, clean the headlights, vacuum the
interior, and give you a lifetime warranty against leaks. I will provid a
new seal. 
  Has anyone ever use these guys before? They are in Tacoma, but I think
they are a national chain. I know its possible that te glass is a little
thinner, or maybe even not as good a quality as the original, but I will
only be using this bus for camping and goofing off, maybe 5000 miles a year.

  I will insure it for the glass, so if it breaks again it will be
replaced(then I will find the best quality one I can). 
On this same note, what seal should I use. Its a Westy so it does not have
the chrome. Should I use WCM, or RMMW, or Bus Depot, other? Are they all
about the same? It will spend all year when not in use in the garage.
Any suggestions would be great. I replaced the one on my 70 Bus and it went
fine until two days later a big rock broke it and I was out of luck, all
that work for nothing.
