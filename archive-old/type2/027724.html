Hi John, since I have never had occasion to take off my belt I did not know 
that the pulley was two halves and the belt height in the groove could be 
changed by belt length/width and shims until someone just told me off-line.  
I understand now.  What can I safely run with my alternator?  9.5mmx205mm?  
9.5mmx200mm?  Smaller?  Do you carry Continentals in these sizes?  I'll 
browse your site in a sec.

John

&gt;&gt;Look at the extremes. If we have a belt infinitely long, the fan would 
&gt;&gt;barely turn because it's out so far on the rim of the alternator pulley 
&gt;&gt;(if it could be adjusted that much). The alt belt fits a little closer to 
&gt;&gt;the center of the center, and the fan speed increases. &lt;&lt;
