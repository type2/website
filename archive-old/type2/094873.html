Subject: Late bay owners? / part help needed!

Hello,

This would be too hard to describe, so here are a couple of images.
The first is a picture of what I have, and the second id a graph showing all 
of the parts that should be there. This is on a 76 westy.

Anyone have a spare parts bus, or know of a location where I could aquire 
the parts I am missing here?

Thanks for any tips, info, needs, etc.



Christopher
76 Westfalia &quot;jasper&quot;
