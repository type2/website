Subject: Pulling bay window gas tank

Hi guys,


    Haven't been on the list in 2-3 years. Just signed back up last night.
Still see a few familiar names.  I've had the gas tank out of a few different
buses over the years, but I've always had the motor out when  I've done it in
the past.  I'm working on a 79 right now that has a dirty tank that needs to
be cleaned and sealed up, and I really don't want to pull the motor, its brand
new :)  I think with the Fuel injected motor I have enough room to sneak the
tank out over the engine, but before I try I'm curious to know if anyone else
has ever done this before?  thanks in advance
Mike
