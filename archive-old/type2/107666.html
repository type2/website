Subject: [T2] BROKE DOWN: starter wires ???


&gt; I am broke down 600 miles from home.  1981 Automatic.  I have several
&gt; questions.

&gt;
&gt; My van will not start - the starter goes, but nothing else.

Just to make sure we're communicating properly: you're saying that the
starter spins, the engine turns over, but the engine won't start?

&gt; 1- I had a vw shop here (that seems to know aircooled vans somewhat well)
&gt; work on my van - they messed with a bunch of wires, and some jusr came
off.
&gt; QUESTION:  How many wires should be connected to the tabs on the soleniod.
&gt; I see 2 in the bentley 1 from the ignition switch, and 1 going to the air
&gt; meter.  BUT the 1 going to the air meter is is a harness with another wire
&gt; with a 'sleeve'.  this second wire is actually 2 wires crimped into 1
&gt; sleeve and is NOT connected to anything.  I don't know where it goes -
&gt; should this be on the solenoid?

There are 2 &quot;spade&quot; connectors on the solenoid.  There's a stout &quot;free
floating&quot; red and black wire to one and a blue wire (that goes into a
harness bundle) on the other.  Then there are 3 wires that connect to a bolt
on the solenoid with a nut holding them in place.  I believe that second
wire (blue, or maybe blue/brown?) actually connects to the combi relay;
without that wire attached, the van certainly won't start.
