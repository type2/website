I found an old junked bus and about all I could tell that was good 
were the two front blinker lens covers.  They are rectangular and 
horizontal (not round).  There are other parts, but I'm no mechanic 
and the bus if FULL of engine parts - maybe bus parts, maybe not.

If you want the the blinkers, let's talk,  I have to drive 1.5 hours (one 
way) to get them.

I'm in Halifax Nova Scotia. and I am NOT on this list, 
(vanagon_dot_com) so send pmail.  Malcolm S   (91 syncro westy)
