Subject: [T2] 76 Westy starts and dies 

&quot;The temperature can be as high as 3,000 degrees Celsius--more than twice 
that generated by a conventional explosive. The blast wave can travel at 
approximately 10,000 feet per second.&quot;

Awesome!!!  10,000 FPS is very close to 6,800 MPH...

Like, almost 10 times the speed of sound.

Say, my question is, if I could recreate that blast wave in my 2.0l, 
resulting in a similar speed in my pistons (10k FPS) in my type2, what would 
my over-the-ground speed be?? Of course, considering I would be in 4th gear, 
and the stroke of a 2.0l is . . .

Yes, of course I would have D load tires on, so no problem there.  And I 
would roll down the door windows to keep from sucking my doors off.

And I would need a special horn, or only the people behind me be would hear 
me because I would be past the people in front before my 'beep - beep' got 
to them.

Time for the synthetic lubricants, I think.

'78 Westy
