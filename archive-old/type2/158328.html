Subject: Re: [T2] Annual smog checks coming to CA? 

The admins are going to axe this aspect of the discussion, and well  
that they should. But not before I point out that Michael Crichton's  
book &quot;State of Fear&quot; was and is a joke. Forget &quot;State of Fear&quot; and  
watch &quot;An Inconvenient Truth.&quot;

I really want a bus to replace Peregrine, a Peregrine II, and I want  
that bus to be my only vehicle -- daily driver and commuter, camper  
and excursion vehicle. I think all the time about the best way to do  
that over time (assuming that I have 20 to 40 years left on this  
planet). I wish that hybrid technology, for instance, were available  
to home tinkers through off-the-shelf components. I imagine that, in  
time, an all-electric alternative will be feasible for traveling good  
distances.

It's true that the smog laws in California are written in a way that  
strongly discourages innovation and experimentation with older  
vehicles. That really should change, although swapping aircooled VW  
engines with much later model watercooled engines is allowed.

But the days of treating global warming as &quot;hysteria&quot; or as a &quot;hoax&quot;  
are over except for a few dead-enders.

&gt; All of this global warming hysteria is not going to bode well for  
&gt; us bus owners as it's going to prompt more and more regulation.  If  
&gt; you haven't read Michael Crichton's 'State of Fear', I'd recommend  
&gt; it.  He was a believer until he started working on the book.  And  
&gt; it's full of good science. Cheers....KR
