Subject: RE: [T2] Overheating generally (&amp; Degreed Pulleys)

David, thanks for the response! I think its good to cover this stuff for those facing the issue for the first time!

&gt;&gt;I am still trying to find a stock 
&gt;&gt;AC jet for a 
&gt;&gt;71 bus--which is what you need for a 1600dp in a bay window.
 
&gt;Vee Parts in San Diego had every size Solex jet I asked them 
&gt;for.  If you 
&gt;still can't find it, let me know what size you need - I may have it 
&gt;(assuming they are the same jets that are in the Solex PDSIT carbs).

Thanks for the advice/offer!  I'll follow up w/ Vee Parts (I had always heard it's an NLA item).

&gt;&gt;Accd to the Gene 
&gt;&gt;Berg catalogue, ...

&gt;What?!?  I would love to see some hard data to back that 
&gt;statement up.

I may have misquoted the GBC - I was typing from memory.  Read the original at: http://www.geneberg_dot_com/ , click on &quot;parts &amp; accessories,&quot; then &quot;pulley's&quot; [sic].

&gt;I just want to point out (again) that in a type 4 engine, the 
&gt;VDO dipstick 
&gt;sender will give you an identical reading to a properly 
&gt;installed sump 
&gt;sender. 

Good point!  I know you have posted on this many times, but I think it bears repeating.

Michael Donnellan
