Subject: Not Starting

Hello,
     I have a problem with my 77 westfalia.  It won't
start.  I think its a fuel problem because it tries,
but just won't start.  I don't think it's the
electrical because it makes that sound-sorry for my
ignorance about cars.  I have been looking in all of
my books about the fuel pressure regulator and I cant
find anything.  By the way, the bus was converted to
carb.  I think it's a fuel lin problem but...  Could I
bypass the regulator and just not use one?  Would that
help or is there something else I should try?  Thanks
a lot.  I appreciate all the help I've gotten-without
this list, my bus would have only been road worthy a
few months.  

Peace,
Tim
