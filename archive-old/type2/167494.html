&gt; Go in the winter time.

I drove the length of Death Valley a couple years ago, in a rental car but
it was October and the temps still exceeded 100F by quite a few degrees
for most of the day. it is about 200 miles if I recall from Scottys Castle
to the town at the South end, and the only services were at the park
service headquarters area.

&gt; Seriously, experienced desert people routinely die there because they
&gt; under/over estimate Death Valley/themselves
&gt; .
&gt; Get online with the NPS, follow all the local rangers' suggestions.
&gt;
&gt; Be prepared for a multi-day hike out if the bus dies.

Amen!

&gt; &gt; since my beloved Goethe and i are quickly approaching 30, i thought
&gt; &gt; that it might be fun to celebrate by driving through Death Valley
&gt; &gt; National Park.  since i am in stl, mo it would be a rather long drive
&gt; &gt; year to do this, supplies, preperations, etc., etc., etc.

on the flip side it was the most absolutely moving and starkly beautiful
place I have ever been.

take your time, enjoy the scenery and remember CELL PHONES DON'T WORK IN
DEATH VALLEY!!!
