Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust Port Plug

You don't have to buy a new part - just get an appropriately sized bolt
from your local hardware store.  It is a metric thread of course, I can't
remember whether it's M8 or M10, but it's a fine pitched thread.  Take one
of the old ones with you to figure the appropriate length and thread pitch.
Buy a little long if you have to and use small washers (like lock washers)
on it to bring the length to what you want.  Use loctite when you put it
back.  Do not allow the bolt to go in much farther than the original one
did!  It will go quite willingly, right into your exhaust port and block
the flow of air out of the port.

&gt;Anybody know a source for these new?  Do I have to buy the original part and
