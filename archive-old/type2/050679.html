Subject: [T2] Cincinnati Area Listees

Merry Friday All!!!! This is definitely a Friday posting  (I hope I am not over-stepping the bounds of the list rules concerning content, etc. but this DOES have bus content.  If I am out of bounds, I'm sorry, but I really want to &quot;turn on&quot; bus brothers and sisters to this musical act that they are sure to LOVE!!)
To those of you who live in the Cincinnati Area:  I would like to invite everybody out to Stanley's Pub on the east side of town tonight (Stanley Avenue, right around the corner from &quot;The Precinct&quot;) for an outstanding show by the &quot;Larry Keel Experience&quot; from Virginia.  Larry Keel was the Telluride Bluegrass Festival flat guitar-picking champion and he and his band play a completely groovy kind of &quot;Appalachian Soul&quot; music. Plus they are friends of mine!  As far as the bus content:  If it doesn't get too icy, I'll be driving my '75 Riviera camper and my good friend will likely show up in his '78 bus, so look for the green camper and maybe I'll buy you a beer (or vice-versa!!!!)
Peace!



Peace, John Baker
