Subject: Expensive Auto parts, was Re: [T2] Wax

&lt;Search eBay for 4567870850 and you'll see that they sell for $800 in used condition!&gt;

Choke, choke, gurgle, sputter.... &lt;grin!&gt;

Okay what makes this cap so much more expensive than a VW 2.0 cap? Supply and demand only?

Have purchased several dist caps for different vehicles I worked on in the past 6 months and none were over $10 or so. 

What makes any &quot;average&quot; car part any more expensive than another? This Porsche parts looks to be made of the same plastic and same type of contacts (though I think mine were just aluminum - not gold plated or brass like those) at the $10 VW Cabrio 2.0 ABA distributor cap... Economies of scale, mass production, etc?
