Thanks Steve,

    The whole point was the importance of a proper adjustment, along with
bleeding. I see it is a lesson you must have learned long ago! :-)
    Your right I try to get the best peddle the first time. One reason is
that almost 100 % of the brake work I do is for a customer. Who may or may
not keep his scheduled services up to date. So by getting the best peddle on
the front end, I save &quot;What the he--'s wrong with my brakes you IDIOT&quot; phone
call. When he has went 10,000 K on the brakes, and says, &quot;oh I forgot&quot;. You
met this guy before I know.

Tommy
