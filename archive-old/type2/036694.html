Hey thanks for the reply. Yes the old carb was the same, and it actually ran
pretty well. The choke was shot as was the idle cut-off valve and the studs
were stripped...but it idled well. I will try the carb cleaner trick, thoug

&gt; Check for vacuum leeks by spraying a can of carb cleaner around the
manifold
&gt; joints?  Take the jets out and check them for blockage.  Was it running
like
&gt; that before the carb change?  Was the old carb a PICT34?

&gt; &gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; &gt;     I just installed a new solex 34pict3 in my bus and when I started it
up,
&gt; &gt; it coughed and sputtered and basically ran like crap. I couldn't get the
&gt; &gt; idle to smooth out no matter which screw I turned. What could this be?
&gt; &gt; Adjusting the air/fuel mixture makes absolutely no noticeable difference
to
&gt; &gt; the way it runs. At least these new symptoms have helped my bus name
&gt; &gt; herself: Weezy.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; TIA,
&gt; &gt; Jeff
