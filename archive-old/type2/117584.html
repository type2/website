Subject: Re: [T2] Booster troubleshooting

Don,

You didn't describe whether they *stop* the bus well or not!

So stiff that you have to stand on them to stop the bus? 

With new correctly adjusted  brakes, 2&quot; of travel might be about right.

Any vacuum leaks?....new o-ring between MC and booster?..or old one still 
good...maybe?

Cheers, dave

&gt; I finally did get my new axle beam in, and mostly everythings ok, 
&gt; except that now my brakes are incredibly stiff - standing on them only 
&gt; moves them a couple inches.  I've checked every vac line, and all is 
&gt; well there.  Wondering where to check next.  Everything went back in 
&gt; smoothly, I've double checked all connections, now just wondering if 
&gt; there is something I might have missed.

&gt; Thanks for all the help this week to those who responded to all my
