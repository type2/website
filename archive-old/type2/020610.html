Subject: Y.O.M. Plates in Ontario 
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

Hi Folks
The Canadian gubbermint has passed Bill 99 that allows YOM plates
Yippeeee!!

This means that plates issued by the province of Ontario , in the same
year in which the vehicle was manufactured, may be attached to a
historic vehicle.  As you know, a vehicle is considered to be historic
if it is at least 30 years old, and is substantially unchanged from
original.

The ministry is still finalizing the registration process but they are
promising by May 2001


Any one have a pair of '62 plates for my Turkis 15 window Deluxe???
