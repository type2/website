&gt; So very happy to hear about welders etc, I purchased a used Century mig
&gt; welder with gas attachment, but don't have a bottle. It did come with a huge
&gt; roll of flux core wire however, so I'm contemplating using that. Is there
&gt; anyone who has come across a website that is useful for showing how to weld
&gt; automotive metal using one of these little 110v units? It has variable speed
&gt; wire feed and a high/low voltage setting. Any info/direction would be great!

get a gas bottle and use the welder as a MIG you will probably be
disappointed in the results using the flux core wire
