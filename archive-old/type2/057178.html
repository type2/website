Subject: WTB a Jetronics ECU for '82 Vanagon
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Greetings from downunder folks.

I am looking for a Bosch Jetronic ECU for an Automatic, Aircooled '82 Vanagon 
(Transporter in Australian parlance).  The part number is 039 906 021 C.  
According to Bosch.VW parts lists I have seen, the same part number with 'CU' 
rather than 'C' in the last position may also be useful.

These vehicles are rather uncommon in Australia, more so as wrecks.

Can anyone pont me in the direction of one please?   Thanks
