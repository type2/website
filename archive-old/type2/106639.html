Subject: FI gas tanks at Moss Landing

The 77 and two 79 models at Moss Landing I mentioned yesterday didn't seem
to have their gas tanks punctured. I took a look underneath and couldn't see
any puncture or hatchet wounds but didn't pull any tanks to prove it. All
were still behind their respective firewalls.

I was afraid to ask if they drained the tanks as per procedure in case they
had missed them and went out to do it after I asked. Sorry I can't give a
more definitive answer...
