Subject: flywheel removal and unknown wire

Another two quick little questions here.  First of all what is that wire
coming off of the top front of the engine near the flywheel, mine seems to
have been cut by the PO and the bus still runs so I'm guessing that it's not
too important but what is it.  Secondly is it possible to remove the
flywheel nuts using one of those hammer driven impact wrenches or do I still
have to somehow fashion a flywheel lock a la Muir?  Thirdly, what are those
three tubes coming off right above the heads (two on the right and one on
the left if my memory serves me well) what are they used for, there is quite
a small orifice in the middle but it seems to be blocked on two of them.
Thanks in advance
