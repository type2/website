Subject: No Compression Caused by Jumping Pushrod

Hi,

I recently discovered that I had lost compression on #4 cylinder.

I pulled the cylinder head off and the mystery unfolded.  The intake pushrod
tip (lifter side) was gauged.  The lifter rod-seat had gauges and lines of
metal wearing like a dremmel tool line.  The valve seat had two significant
gauges.  Also the push rod had a circular wear ring where the pushrod had
rubbed against the case at a specific point between the lifter and rocker arm.
It was obviously bouncing around alot.

Cause:  poor valve adjustment on my part I suspect after the engine had been
rebuilt.  I did the best I could and now I am learning from experience.

Questions:

Should I get a new cylinder head or just take it to a machine shop and have it
reworked?

Should I invest in hydraulic lifters?

Should I inspect the other cylinder head?

Should I suspect that the camshaft is damaged?

If you would like to see the pictures, I will be more that happy to send them
to you.

Have a Great Day!
