Yeah,
That's the next best way to do it.  I've got an inexpsive one that works
ok.  If you want better results, expect to pay in the 800+ range..

If you want to get really accurate results, you need to get it dyno
tested and a shop.  That way, your fuel ratio can be set with a load on
the engine.  Not sure 'bout the price, but it's probably under a
hundred...

&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, think the only way to test it is on a bench with some
&gt; &gt; kind of metered airflow.  I've tried to find specs but nobody has them,
&gt; &gt; or is willing to share them..
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I messed with mine ALOT but I could never really get it right.. I
&gt; &gt; finally swapped out a working one..
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; I was wondering if there is a way to determine if an AFM is adjusted
&gt; &gt; &gt; properly - ie is the big coil spring set correctly?  Is there a
&gt; &gt; &gt; specification for how much torque it should take to open the flap all
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; way or some such thing?  I suspect that the spring on one that I have is
&gt; too
&gt; &gt; &gt; tight.  I'm wondering because I have an almost brand new rebuilt AFM
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; runs my engine very lean (great for smog tests), but can't be adjusted
&gt; to my
&gt; &gt; &gt; or my mechanic's comfort level (with gas analyzer) using the idle adjust
&gt; &gt; &gt; screw.  I'm using another AFM right now and trying to get this 'bad' AFM
&gt; in
&gt; &gt; &gt; working order to use as a spare on an upcoming xcountry trip.  Any
&gt; &gt; &gt; suggestions?

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; P.S.  My wife used to complain that the bus was difficult to drive in
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; wind - I thought she was just whining until I replaced the steering box
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; steering damper - Thanks Bus Depot for selling me the parts to make my
&gt; bus a
&gt; &gt; &gt; pleasure to drive on the highway, and my wife happy.
&gt; &gt; &gt; P.P.S.  If you see oil and crud on your steering box - check to see if
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; still has oil inside it.  The one I took out was covered in greasy
&gt; sludge
&gt; &gt; &gt; and dry as a bone inside.  I wonder why my steering was so tough.
&gt; &gt; &gt; P.P.P.S  Sorry if I am babbling - excited about upcoming trip.
