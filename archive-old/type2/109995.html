Subject: Re: [T2] fuel pump pressure

This is absolutely correct Steve---

If every fuel filter of yore became plugged up, there wouldn't be any
vehicles left on the road--they would have all blown or burnt up with
the big back pressure, plugged fuel filter theory--

I wonder where that idea came from?

Any mechanical pump will only build the pressure it was designed to run
at--no more--no big bang in the fuel lines-- 

The worst that can happen here is the vehicle in question stops running
due to acute fuel starvation--that's all--

 
E-mail message   
 
Regarding fuel pressure with a restricted filter, I think the fuel
pressure is determined by the strength of the fuel pump spring. A
restriction between the pump and the carburetor will not raise the fuel
pressure. The mechanical fuel pump has self-regulated pressure.

More Voo Doo idea's--

As far as putting one between the pump and the carb., 
consider what
will 
happen when the filter becomes clogged. Pressure will build between the
pump and the filter&lt;
