Subject: spark plug heat path

Folks,

I didn't keep a copy of the spark plug heat response from someone this 
morning, but all of you may find the discussion(and animated pictures)
here of use.

Of particular interest are the pics about half way down the page 
describing what I discussed about the difference between &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;cold&quot; plugs.


Cheers, dave
