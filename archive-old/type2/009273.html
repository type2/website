Hi Hanley-Davis
I found that a catalytic converter will get very hot(red hot)if air is 
allowed to enter the exhaust system, this can happen if an air pump is over 
working or if there is a manifold leak for i.e.
this should cause backfire pops as the unburned fuel from the engine ignites 
as it passes through the &quot;cat&quot;.
fire requires oxygen
just my $0.02

&gt; &gt; Dear list,
&gt; &gt;             This one's got me stumped. Maybe you can help.
&gt; &gt; I'm driving my '78 2.0L  FI camper along the freeway for about five
&gt; &gt; minutes, it wasn't even up to operating temp. Suddenly it starts bucking
&gt; &gt; and losing power. I manage to get it to an off ramp and pull into an
&gt; &gt; AM/PM where I can't restart it. I go around the back to check things out
&gt; &gt; and the catalytic converter is glowing red! Not a minute later a
&gt; &gt; fire-truck pulls in saying someone had reported a car with flames coming
&gt; &gt; out the tail-pipe. Since nothing seemed to be currently burning I told
&gt; &gt; them it was OK and got the beast towed home.
&gt;
&gt;--&gt; Well, among other things, if you were misfiring on one or more
&gt;cylinders (bad spark plug wire, perhaps?  Bad points?  Some other ignition
&gt;problem?) you'd have a lot of unburned fuel going out the exhaust.  This
&gt;would probably burn in the converter and result in exactly what you had
&gt;happen.
&gt;
&gt;I suspect the reason your van bucked and stalled is that the overheated
&gt;innards of the converter collapsed and plugged off the exhaust.  If this
&gt;is the case, reinstalling it would be, obviously, inadvisable.
&gt;
