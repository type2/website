Subject: Carb question (I ought to know !)

Well,  I'm trying to get some more fuel economy out of my 1970 Bus  - stock
1600 single-port.

The timing seems spot on.  (Although I always feel a little insecure about
the points gap - I do it to the best of my ability, but I'd rather know that
the dwell-angle is right - it seems so much more &quot;accurate&quot; - I don't have a
strobe - I do mine statically - like Muir says - with a home made light.)

I've readjusted the choke - it seems just right now - always a bit trial and
error.  (I reckon Muir didn't have to cope with chokes - 'cause he lived in
the toasty warm parts of the 'States.)

But adjusting the mixture is much more tricky.  I've always read that you
should turn the screw in until the engine starts to stumble, then wind it
out by a turn.   But I'd like to know what this actually *does*...   

If I turn the screw inwards, am I making the mixture richer or leaner ???

It's the stock Solex carb of course.  (I can't remember which version -
while I'm sat here - but I'm thinking that won't effect the answer.)
