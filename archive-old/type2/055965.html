Subject: Stuck pedal

Dear list,

I hope You could help me, my friend and my '71 VW Kombi to begin our
summer tour across Europe in time. I tried to start the engine today,
but to my surprise the accellerator pedal got stuck when I pushed it
to the floor. First I tought the cable was the problem, but it is
fine. Then I noticed, that a part of the Solex 34 PICT 3 rubs against
the generator and in full throttle it gets stuck. According to 
Haynes the part is: bell crank lever (adjustable).
What does this part do? Can I adjust it somehow not to reach the
generator or what could be the solution for this problem?

Any help would be greatly appreciated! TIA!
