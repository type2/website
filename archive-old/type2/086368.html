Subject: [T2] luggage rack spacers


I need to find replacement rubber spacers for the back of my luggage rack
(1971 westy).  I talked to Joe at Busted Bus and he did not have any, though
he thought there was a product that could be used.  Perhaps a hard rubber
motor/machine mount.  Does anyone have any suggestions for replacing these.
Steve
