Subject: '67 split carb question

        THIS IS NOT FROM ME! THIS IS FROM TODD FRANCIS, &lt;tbf_at_pacifier_dot_com&gt;!
SEND YOUR EMAIL TO HIM, NOT ME! Todd is on the Vanagon list, so please
reply to him PERSONALLY, he doesn't read Type2.

        Sorry to shout, whenever I've done this I've had a mess of answers
sent to me...

&gt;Subject: '67 split carb question
&gt;
&gt;  Can someone identify a aluminum riser block on my '67 that is bolted
&gt;between the carburator and manifold? It is about 1 1/2 inch tall and has
&gt;some sort of mechanism sticking out the side that has a vertical plate about
&gt;2&quot; x3&quot; bolted to it. the plate says 28 DR-15. As you look at the engine from
&gt;the rear of the bus you look right at it, as it directly in front of the
&gt;carb. It kind of seems to be some sort of a governor but I have no idea. Any
&gt;thoughts would be appreciated. thanks
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Hi Eddie: Would you please forward the above to the type2 list? I bought a
&gt;67 Westy (I found it on the list. The guy lived 10 blocks away!) It's pretty
&gt;cool. It has a complete interior with kindercot and also has a side tent. I
&gt;am doing some restoration on it. If you hear anything about this carb thing
&gt;let me know. Thanks a lot.
