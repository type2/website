This may be like the blind leading the blind...

but I'd start by looking for vacuum leaks. One likely place is where the carbs
seat to the intake manifold. What I do is spray a jet of carb cleaner at this
joint and listen for any hint of acceleration. If the carb cleaner
(quick-start may even be better) makes the engine perk up, then you're sucking
air at the manifold. Try re-torquing the carbs, cleaning the mating surfaces,
using new gaskets. I had to use gasket compound on mine :-(

Check connections on all your vacuum lines, including the one going to the
brake servo!  You might also try looking to see if the rough idle is limited
to one cylinder--pull each plug wire from the distributor tower &amp; see if this
changes the idle. If the idle doesn't change, then something is wrong with
that particular cylinder (did you assemble the plug wires correctly, screwing
the insulators onto the wires?) Don't do this right after filling the engine
bay with vapor from Quick-Start, however, or BOOM!
