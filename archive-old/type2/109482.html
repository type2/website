Subject: Re: [VB] Auxillary battery/Alternative Entertainment

I believe that if my parents could have, they CERTAINLY would have, used a
TV or ANYTHING, that would have kept me from pestering my siblings.
I for one, just used a tv/vcr combo for the first time, going to the same
event as Mr. Baker, and can attest, it beat the Heck out of not having it!
