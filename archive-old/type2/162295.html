Subject: Re: [T2] More Insurance Questions 

Greg,

Try here.

Don't know where you are....

Not necessarily cheap, but if you do two at once, you should get 
a little better price.  They person that comes out may not know
about VW's particularly, but they have people that do.

They guy that came out and did my bus and Puma was *very* thorough
and did an excellent job.

If you have ever been a judge at a car show, you will recognize the skills 
involved.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Y'all will love this one.  I just bought a 74 acapulco Thing and called my insurance agency to insure it.  They told me I need to go to an authorized VW dealer to get them to appraise it and by the way, get them to appraise my 74 single cab at the same time, (on which they currently have the insurance).
&gt;    
   Today i went to our local VW dealer to speak to them.  They MIGHT could help me with the Thing, but they have never heard of a 74 Single Cab truck.  They were nice enough to offer me 3 blank forms that I could put any information I wanted to on and forge someone's signature.  (I didn't take them of course).  This is so frustrating.  greg
