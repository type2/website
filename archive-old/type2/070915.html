Hydrocarbon's are what in the US they refer to as HC, these are the emissions
that evaporating gas gives off. Living in the sovereign state of Calif. we're
quite familiar with smog tests. Does your bus have a catalytic converter? I
just went through this with a 89 chevy, wouldn't pass until the mechanic broke
down and confided that the cat was probably at fault. Replace the cat and
passed no problem
