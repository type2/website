Subject: Re: [T2] Hooking up brake servo w/ Dual Webers

I think John is correct here. The set up for a pair of dual throat carbs 
would need to have a tap in each of the four manifold runners to balance 
effectively. This would work like gangbusters on a dual, single venturi 
setup, but with 4 venturis, all 4 would have to be tapped to balance.
