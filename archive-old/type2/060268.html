Hi folks,

If you're about to rebuild a 1600, tinker with your transmission, or repair
your front door lock, stop by my web page.  Three of the four articles are
compilations of posts I made to the list last year when I was knee deep in
engine and transmission parts. I've updated these with my current
observations.  The front door lock article is new.  I'll be adding about 1-2
new articles per month accompanied by photos, so check back!
