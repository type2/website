Subject: Re: [T2] CarTalk

&gt;This weekend on Car Talk, a caller was asking for input on a van she could
&gt;live in during an extended road trip. She was interested in the Bus and the
&gt;Car Talk guys actually agreed with her!

Here's the link to where you can listen to the clip:

The thing is that it will be updated on Monday or Tuesday.

I love car talk even though they usually bash VWs and especially the 
aircooled ones.  I look forward to hearing that call.
