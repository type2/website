Subject: Understanding AFC fuel injection--question

------=_NextPart_001_0000_01C19160.78E228E0

Volks,
I just spent the better part of the day diagnosing my fuel injection on m=
y 81 and am back where i started.  =20

I have an official vw AFC book, as well.  What I do not get is the proces=
s when it is starting cold.....air flows thru the AFM, and if the motor i=
s cold enough, the auxillary air regulator is open, and air is diverted t=
o the intake manifold, thus bypassing the throttle body.  This book says =
that this enables the motor to act the same cold as it does hot, for the =
control unit adds additional fuel to the injectors when it senses the eng=
ine is cold.  Now, there is no sensor, or anything on the throttle body, =
so how does this auxillary air regulator do anything?  The air still ends=
 up in the intake manifold and thus diverted to the cylinders anyway.....=
.............I could see it doing something if it were unregulated air, b=
ut it is regulated at the AFm.................
