Hey,,, I live by the rule,, if it ain't broke , don't fix it...
It is fun to go to a weekend show,,, it gives you the reason to wash and
clean your Bus.
and we always have to fix something on the way!  So the Bus gets improved
for every show.....this also lets you meet people while you have your head
in the engine compartment trying to figure out why the thing won't run and
your late again!
One other thing,,, people refer you to some guy  who has a parts bus just
around the corner,,,  one day Its going to be a 23 window deluxe ,,,,,,, I
just know it!
Have fun,,
No matter how Rusty they are !  Right Richard  aka Rusty Bus
It is late,,, this should be ok,,,,,I think it is friday!!
