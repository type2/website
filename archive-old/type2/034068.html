Subject: Re: jumpering a fuse

&gt;
&gt; what I do is put a high amp ammeter accross the fuse points.
&gt;
&gt; ie:  I remove the fuse, take leads from each side to the dash board area
&gt; and hook up a 50 amp meter that I have, works pretty good when looking for
&gt; intermittent problems.  (if I draw more than 50 amps or even less and it
&gt; doesn't shut off I have a switch in one of the lines, or just pull the
&gt; wire off)

Thank you. I believe what you have described is jumpering the fuse protection
with an inline meter and on/off switch . Work's for me.

The original question was how he (the origional poster) could test for the
wipers and lights not coming on when the vehicle is cold without alot of
diagnostics. The obvious place to start is to look for a loose fitting fuse or
fuse wire connection. Not a hard concept for most.

Or you could start with a test light at the same test points but finding an
intermittent open is sometimes easier found by eliminating the problem rather
than &quot;seeing&quot; it with a test light.  It's entirely possible to eliminate the
problem before you ever know or see exactly where it is with a test light.

Hell, the problem could be anywhere but the question was, as I understood it,
where's the easiest place to start looking.
