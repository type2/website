Subject: Re: [T2] Bus tires ?

&gt; You might want to shop around for a place that can do the balancing
&gt; **on the vehicle**. Apparently this is a new thing that some local tire

To have them balanced &quot;on the vehicle&quot; is good... as long as you keep the
same tire on the same area of the car and on the same lugs.  If the tire is
removed, the lugs must be indexed in order to keep the balance.  And of
course tire rotations will throw it off too.  It is a superior balance as
long as these things are observed.

Have a good one,
Eric
