Subject: Bus Underside Restoration

Ok, 

	So... now that I have the Bus in the garage, I'm planning on going
over the entire thing. I figured I would start by sanding, cleaning, and
painting the underside of the Bus. While I was down there, I would replace
everything that needed to be replaced, and fix everything that needed to be
fixed.

I wanted to ask... what is the best paint or.. sealer I guess to use on the
underside of the body? It seems to be covered in a decent layer of grime,
and possibly old undercoating. Would it be heretical for me to coat the
underside in Por-15? I know people always say.. &quot;It's your car! Do what you
want to it!!&quot; But for me, it's a little different, I work on my cars with
the idea that when my time comes, I can donate it to a museum, and they'd be
proud to have it displayed (as original).

So.. what have you guys done in this respect?
