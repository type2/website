I've carried those small (1#?) cylinders inside my bus for years in the
back cubbie holes. No problem. I've carried a 2.5-gal one on my roofrack
on extended trips also and ran a hose inside to a Coleman stove I'd set up
on top of the counter. Works OK. I might be a little spooked to store
propane inside if I were travelling through a really hot area.

The stock Westy stove setup has a pressure reducing valve near the tank.
The gas in the line and the stove itself are running on low pressure
propane.

My Coleman portable stove is designed to run on high pressure propane.
There is some kind of a pressure reducing valve at the point where the
bottle screws on, but it doesnt reduce it to the same low pressure that
the stock stove wants.

If you want to convert the stock stove to run on another source of fuel,
you will have to account for the pressure valvesdd appropriately.

In most counties in CA the won't refill the stock propane tanks unless you
get them inspected by some fire marshall I have never been able to
identify.

I smelled gas in my bus once and it was because the stove valve had been
turned on a little bit by accident. Definitely the first thing to check if
you ever smell gas.

Drive safely,
RT
