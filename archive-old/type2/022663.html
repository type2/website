&lt;&lt; m I missing something here?  The body of oil pressure senders need to be
 grounded and tape and pipe dope will insulate the sender. The path to ground 
for
 the senders is through the pipe threads.   Tape has to potential to insulate
 more than dope as the dope wipes off.  Use tape and you run the risk of the
 sender not working &gt;&gt;

this is also a very valid point, that i should have mentioned also.  but it 
seems that they work when using somekind of sealant.  i do not know i do not 
personally use a sealant or tape of any kind.  my opinion was only of a 
suggestion if you are dead set on using something on the threads.  peace
