&gt; Who has any pictures of the fi style tank that goes in an 79 or
&gt; similar bus. I keep going through fuel filters every 3 or 4 months &amp;
&gt; suspect some crap in the bottom of the tank. What I really want to
&gt; know is if the 2 hose bibbs on the bottom of the tank are actually
&gt; flush with the bottom or if the are actually slightly higher in the
&gt; tank. I'd like to do a semi-flush while it's still cold, just don't
&gt; want to do it if flushing it in place will simply keep a lot of loose
&gt; crud on the bottom of the tank.

They are not quite flush with the bottom of the tank.  They protrude about
5mm.  If you increase the brightness and contrast of this image you can see
the holes more clearly.

I also found this new picture of the bottom of that tank that I haven't
posted before.
