Subject: Full Moon Upstate lunch meeting
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

We had our monthly lunch at Denny's yesterday. Six splitties and 3
Vanagons showed up (which included Steve's newly acquired V'gon DC). The
local chapter of Full Moon Bus Club has become very active and close
knit. I was in on the formation of the local chapter at the beginning,
but was unable to attend the last few meetings. It makes me feel good
that close friendships have formed, everyone is helping each other out,
and we're keeping in touch with each other because of this club.

On another note, has anyone heard from Chad and Willa (and their dog
Butter), who were traveling from Gainesville FL to DE in the purple '72?
Meredith and I gave them some assistance (they got our names from the
A.I.R.S. list), and we haven't heard anything about them since...

david
