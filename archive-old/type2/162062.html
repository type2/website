Subject: Trip away

&gt; Dear Listees
&gt;
&gt; Have just returned from 3 1/2 weeks away in our 76 Poptop (wife, 12  
&gt; yo son &amp; me).
&gt; We live in Hobart Tasmania so all long trips involve heading to the  
&gt; Big Island (mainland Australia).
&gt;
&gt; We got the overnight ferry from Tasmania to Melbourne, Victoria,  
&gt; disembarking at 07:15.  We traveled up thru Victoria into New South  
&gt; Wales as far as Gilgandra before blowing a rear tire (cheap Chinese  
&gt; &quot;Woosung&quot; brand that was on the bus when we brought it -- had too  
&gt; much tread to throw away),  Wheel nuts so tight I split the socket  
&gt; of the wheel brace (not original) so for the first time in my life  
&gt; had to call for roadside assistance to change a tire.
&gt; Still we managed over 900 kms for the day by 21;00.
&gt;
&gt; Picked up 2 x new tires in Coonabarabran (no-one had Hankooks so  
&gt; had to settle for Sava [apparently made by Dunlop??] 185R/75's &amp;  
&gt; kept going.  At top of NSW is Moree where they have artesian bores  
&gt; with naturally heated swimming pools, one is 38C, the other 42C.   
&gt; Skin felt great when we got out &amp; muscles relaxed.
&gt;
&gt; Left Moree &amp; headed into Queensland via Goondiwindi finally  
&gt; arriving at my wife's parents place at 23;30, a total of almost  
&gt; 1900 kms in 2 days.
&gt;
&gt; Spent few days with 'outlaws' then down to Brisbane to catch up  
&gt; with friends for a few days, down to Mount Tamborine behind the  
&gt; Gold Coast, onto a 4 star resort at Yamba on the NSW coast for 3  
&gt; days with our daughter, son-in-law &amp; grandson.
&gt;
&gt; On to Coffs Harbour till end on the week, back over the Great  
&gt; Dividing range to Tamworth, to Coonabarabran, back down the Newell  
&gt; highway to Victorian border to Cobram where I grew up as a kid.   
&gt; Caught up with a mate I have not seen for 35 years (scary how he's  
&gt; aged!!!), over to Echuca to see the paddle steamers on the Murray  
&gt; River, down to Melbourne to catch the ferry, then home to Hobart.
&gt;
&gt; Total trip 5,400 kms.  Av fuel consumption 25.5 mpg (imperial) at  
&gt; mostly 100-105 kph.
&gt; Bus did not miss a beat despite running at 3400 rpm for hours on  
&gt; end on the open flat roads of NSW.
&gt;
&gt; Av fuel price was $1.45 per litre for 627 litres, total of  
&gt; $910.00.  That plus the $730.00 ferry fare &amp; only one night in a  
&gt; caravan park ($20.00) made for a pretty reasonable vacation cost.
&gt;
&gt; Only problems from trip is a loud squeak from the front end which I  
&gt; will have to investigate this weekend and the lack of other  
&gt; busses.  Only saw 10 buses in all with only 2 of those actually  
&gt; being driven.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers
&gt;
