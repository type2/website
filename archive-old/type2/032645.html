Subject: VW Coke Toys And Bubblehead 5 pack

The Target by my house has the 2 box set of the Coke VW's for $7.40.  If
someone wants them I will get a couple and ship to you (You gotts to pay the
shipping too)  Let me know!!
They also had a couple of the Matchbox Bubblehead 5 packs (The only VW is a
blue bug with a Bubblehead Logo on it) but this was a couple of days before
X-mas and I doubt that there are any left but I will try.  Contact me if you
want either or both and I will see what I can do
