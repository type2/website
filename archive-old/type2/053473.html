&gt; I have to confess, I've got a mechanical mental block on this one.  My saggy

&gt; take rotating the rear bars on because I'm afraid it will drag on and I'll
&gt; lose precious summer hours.  Even the garage I trust most in these parts
&gt; won't do it (VW specialists no less) because they say parts break, etc.

The new August issue of VW Trends just happens to have an article on the
proceedure with several pictures.  A 67 Beetle was the vehicle used.
