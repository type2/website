Subject: Argggh!..what did I miss?

Folks,

I am putting together my new engine(for my 78) with 72-74
heater boxes and tin.

I must have missed something in the discussion about this
switchover from 78 to 72-74, cause I got down to test fitting
my new powder coated heat exchangers and my 78 control box
and tubes....WUPS! 

The 72-74 heater boxes holes are *round* and the control box
tubes that are supposed to fit on them are *oval*.

I don't remember anyone saying before that they didn't fit...
Do you gently squeeze the oval shape to round??? or have to have 
the correct tubes from the heater box to the control box?
Did I mention that both parts are fresh powder coated?

If I can squeeze them to a round shape, will they fit correctly and match 
up to the flexible heater tube to frame holes for my 78?


Cheers, dave
