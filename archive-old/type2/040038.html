Subject: Fuel Neck

It looks like some of my fuel leak is coming from the rubber neck that goes 
between the tank and the cap. I noticed GoWesty lists them on their web 
site, but does not actually have any in stock. Anyone know where I can find 
one? Has anybody attempted to repair one? If so what material would work 
well. How about that plasticoat? Gas soluble?
