&gt;&gt; Ok, I'm a bit frustrated here. My Bus NORMALLY never gives me an
&gt;&gt; attitude. Normally when I start my Bus, it rattles for a split
&gt;&gt; second while it builds up oil pressure. However, the last time I
&gt;&gt; started it, I noticed a rattle on one of the lifters that didn't go
&gt;&gt; away. So I drive the Bus about a mile hoping that the lifter would
&gt;&gt; pump up, but still no, it STILL rattles.

Seriously, have you checked the timing lately?

Only time I hear rattles in my lifters was when out of tune and the
timing was off.
