&gt; &gt;&gt; pretty good.  however, this does not help my hypothesis about a
&gt; &gt;&gt; dropped seat.  maybe its floating.  dunno.  after seeing these

&gt; &gt; not very likely floating on a 2,000rpm solid lifter engine

&gt; Are you talking about the seat floating,, or valve float ?
&gt;

&gt; I took it to mean the seat was not secure in the head
