Volks,

I have had kicking around my place for 7-8 months a flyer from a person in
?Manassas? who does VW engine rebuilds here.  I wanted to stop by his
shop today and, of course, I can't find the flyer :-(  Does anyone know
contact info for this shop.  All I can think of is German Engine
Rebuilders aas a name, but I am sure that is wrong :-(

                           H Steven Dolan

Today's guru was yesterday's
&quot;Can I drive on two cylinders?&quot; poster.
