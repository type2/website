Subject: Re: [T2] Installing Piston Rings &amp; Juggs

&gt;This van is begining to be a very fun experiance, however I have never been
&gt;this deep into an engine before.  I would appriciate any words of wisdom! :)

Pull the engine! &lt;grin&gt;

Seriously - make sure nothing - no foreign material (that is dirt, not 
fabric made overseas) gets into your engine or your problems will grow in 
short order. Sounds tough (to me) with the engine installed.
