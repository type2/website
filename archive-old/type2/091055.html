&gt; My '78 Campmobile is totaled according to our insurance company.  I took it
&gt; to the frame and axel place in town.  He said the driver's side rear arm,
&gt; spring plate, and probably the spindle are bent.  He recommended I try to
&gt; pull the whole unit of a junkyard bus (if I can find one). Here's my
&gt; questions:
&gt; 1. What year busses would have these units that would work in a '78?

'68-79

&gt; 2. Are regular bus and westy bus rear ends the same?

No.  The torsion bars in passenger vans are different than the torsion
bars in campmobiles (Westies) and in commercial vehicles.

&gt; 3. Is this a job a beginner should tackle?

No

&gt; 4. What years rear bumpers would work for my '78?

'73-79

&gt; I really would like to resurect this bus.  Although we only had it for a
&gt; year, we had some great times in it, and it's a great runner.  I'll worry
&gt; about the body and interior damage later but would like to get it up to
&gt; passing our state (Washington) state patrol inspection in order to get our
&gt; title back.

Jaques,

What you are contemplating is certainly possible, but when the rear
torsion
tube is bent, you are at a major decision point. In my book, your
insurance company is correct... your bus died.  With enough money,
however, resurrection is possible for a car.  Certainly the &quot;restorations&quot;
of some early Rolls Royces prove this!  Start with an original gas pedal
and build a car around it, basically :-)

I would really prefer if Kelly would weigh in here (and I actually called
to ensure that :-), but slicing out the rear housing and installing a new
one is a *MAJOR* project.  First, it is a big sub-assembly, second,
alignment is *critical* and third, your life depends on the welds not
cracking.  All three of these militate toward getting a real pro to tackle
the job.  If i had a bus that I was so sentimetally attached to or if I
had a bus that was so valuable that I would attempt this, I would look for
someone like Kelly, who has *years* of experience and the tools to attempt
it.
