&gt;J tubes for type 4 s do exist but are as expensive as a pair of heater 
&gt;boxes from ron.  i had some , just sold them in fact someone offered me 
&gt;enough to by new heater boxes even in their used condition! So in my 
&gt;oppinion you are better off just getting a new pair of boxes and having 
&gt;heat.

&gt; &gt; You're talking about J-Tubes, here, I think.  I've seen them for Type I 
&gt;engines, but not for Type IV. They probably exist somewhere, though.
