I was going to do a FI install on a 74 bus and I didn't even consider 
cobbling the fuel return.  I figure if automotive engineers decided that it 
was necesary for running FI on the bus (and all other CIS vehicles for that 
matter) I WAS'NT going to second guess them, particularily on issues 
surrounding fuel delivery.

Either swapping for a later fuel tank or installing a fuel sump of some sort 
seems to pass the muster of most folks that do this kind of thing 
proffessionally.  Check under a late 80's VW Fox the next time you visit a 
u-pull-it.  They have an easily removable small plastic tank that appears to 
function as a sump.  

Maybe someone on the list with more knowledge than I could comment on the 
necesary capacity of a functional sump?
