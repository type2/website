&gt;Well, I have an old one, but the rubber on the outside is broken and the 
&gt;outside metal &quot;wrapping&quot; is rusted.  The tube is still pretty solid, but 
&gt;I'm not sure if I should use it or not.  It seems like there is also 
&gt;another tube inside of the metal &quot;wrapping&quot; so I might go ahead and use 
&gt;it.

It should just be a rubber wrapped corkscrew of a thick flat wire.

&gt;The older tube that I have uses metal ends instead of the newer 
&gt;tubes that have plastic ends.  Plus, I think I remember the newer tubes 
&gt;being slightly longer than the older tubes.

I've found the opposite. The original tube had plastic ends, the newer ones metal.

&gt;Do you think a longer tube (with more bend) will lead to faster cable wear?

If that produces more bend in the tube, yes.
