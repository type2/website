I've been not using Chumpions since 1967. Very foul results in a 283
Chumpy. The only time I use them is on some English cars that call for
them, and then only if an approved alturnative is not right here handy. I
can't say they are all bad. Some years of 911 call for them. They wouldn't
if they didn't pass the testing. Besides, when a Bosch equivalent is
approved, why compromise???

Their electrodes always looked a bit shy of mass to me. Compare them to a
Bosch Super or Autolight or AC or Beru or...... and you'll see what I mean.
