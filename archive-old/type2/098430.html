Subject: Cylinder head temp sensor

Greetings --

To make a long story short, my cylinder head temp
sensor threads on the head are shot.  I broke the old
temp sensor trying to remove it, drilled it out,
attempted to tap it and fit a new (used) one, but now
the hole is oversized.  I tried JB welding it in to no
avail.  I am not 100% sure that the new(used) sensor
is okay, because I get very erratic readings from the
ohmmeter, but I also think that it's possible that
it's not properly seated, because the readings
fluctuate when I touch the wire coming from the
sensor.  

When the engine is cold, it starts easily and idles a
little too fast.  As the engine warms during a drive
around the block, it begins to run very rough, idling
poorly, and then dies.  When the engine cools, it'll
start right back up.  It's not really a question of
what's causing the problem, it's what's the best way
to solve the problem without buying a new head just
for the temp sensor fitting.  Is it because steel
epoxy has poor heat and/or electrical conductivity and
is giving a false reading to the AFM?

About ten minutes after the engine got to a
temperature that exceeded the temp sensor (the engine
died), the reading on the sensor was 750 ohms.  The
sensor to the tough was very warm, but depending on
the ground, the reading fluctuated between 350 and 750
ohms.  Touching the wire that comes from the sensor
would swing it to infinity. 

All input welcomed.  Thanks, all.
