Subject: RE:  Air Shocks

&gt;Looking for neat ways to dope up my 72 westy.  How much would air 
&gt;shocks and compressor junk run me for a vw beastie bus.  I can't
imagine 
&gt;it would be safe to make it hop, but it would be fun to make it a low
rider 
&gt;on demand.

The deal is, the shock mounts on a bus are NOT designed to be
weight-bearing mounts.  Bus shocks are there to dampen the motion, but
do not affect the ride height.  You can remove all 4 shocks from your
bus and it will look just the same as it did with the shocks on it.

Also, there have been many disappointed bus-owners who bought the NAPA
coil-over replacement shocks that fit the back of the loaf bus to raise
it back to stock height only to discover broken shock mounts 1 month
later.
