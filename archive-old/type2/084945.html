Subject: RE: [T2] Starter,Solenoid,Ignition??? (First post on T2)

Any Ford. Visit any flaps. You need one with two large lugs that were used 
for the battery cables in a Ford and one little terminal for the wire that 
connected to the key switch.

Many also came with two little terminals. No harm done, leave the second 
small terminal unconnected.

Lawn Tractor relays are good.

Motorcycle relays are good. I bought a Yamaha relay last week for $30 verus 
the $120 for the Honda relay for my Honda motorcycle.

You could use a 30 amp Radio Shack relay for $6 but it isn't weather proof.

I like the lawn mower or Ford relay best.

&gt;Does anyone know the part number or the year and model vehicle of a good
&gt;starter relay to use on the bus starter.

&gt;
&gt;Get a color wiring schematic. Bentley has them in black and white but
&gt;labels every wire so you can still follow it.
&gt;
&gt;I don't have it close at hand so I can't tell you facts....
&gt;
&gt;In short from memory - the terminal on the solenoid is from the key. If you
&gt;apply 12 volts positive here the starter will try to engage. That is what
&gt;you accomplish with the key. The key switch will fail about every 20 years
&gt;or so and fail to supply 12v+ to the solenoid. Also from time to time the
&gt;solenoid will bind so despite the fact that the key is supplying 12v+ the
&gt;solenoid will still fail to function. In that case a few light whacks with
&gt;a hammer on the side of the solenoid will usually get you moving. In this
&gt;case build a starter relay as per the plans in the back of the Muir book.
&gt;The VW catalogs have them in kits but you can do the same with an old Ford
&gt;starter relay (much more heavy duty than a headlight relay found in the
&gt;catalog kits) and you might have a Ford relay laying around. I am assuming
&gt;that when you short the terminals on the starter with a screwdriver the
&gt;engine starts cranking 'til it fires up (normally)... if not then you have
&gt;your symptoms mixed up.
&gt;
&gt;Also any other wire on the solenoid will be hot only when the key is in the
&gt;start position.
&gt;
&gt;I can't think of any other thing on a carb bus that needs to be doing
&gt;something only while the bus is starting.
&gt;
&gt;With a test meter and a friend you can pull the wires that connect to the
&gt;starter solenoid and with the key in the start position one of these wires
&gt;should be hot each time the switch is turned to &quot;start&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;The starter itself has a large cable from the battery. I think the
&gt;alternator also may be connected the starter cable with a smaller red wire
&gt;(larger than the wires on the solenoid).
&gt;
&gt;Safety: do not lay in front of the tire - you don't want the bus to move
&gt;forward or backward and run over you.
&gt;
&gt;Make sure that your helper knows how to pull the main coil wire to kill the
&gt;engine should in your experiments the engine start and the helper somehow
&gt;discover that it won't shut off (they break the key)... Make sure that your
&gt;helper knows that they can push in the clutch and the van will not move
&gt;when the engine is running.
&gt;
&gt;I know some of us use young family members and girlfriends (or boyfriends)
&gt;that either might not know what to do if there was a shadetree mechanic
&gt;emergency or they panic and forget what to do...
&gt;
&gt;Neutral, brake on, etc...

&gt; &gt;I've been reading the book &quot;How To Keep Your VolksWagen Alive, a Manual of
&gt; &gt;Step By Step Procedures For The Complete Idiot&quot; and apparently I'm beyond a
&gt; &gt;complete idiot.(&lt;-- Be Nice) While working on the starter I noticed one of
&gt; &gt;the wires that hooks to the solenoid was broken and probably had been for
&gt; &gt;awhile. (Two weeks ago the bus would turn over fine.) According to the
&gt;book,
&gt; &gt;one of the wires on the solenoid goes to the ignition switch and the other
&gt; &gt;is labeled Fuel Injection. I have a '71 Westfalia. No fuel injection there.
&gt; &gt;But I can't seem to track where the wire goes or it's purpose. I took a
&gt;look
&gt; &gt;at another '71 running bus and the wire was hooked up on there too. Can
&gt; &gt;anyone help me with this? I've been trying to troubleshoot why I don't have
&gt; &gt;12volts to the ignition switch. I can turn over the starter by jumping the
&gt; &gt;posts on the solenoid. Is the second wire a return from the ignition
&gt;switch?
&gt; &gt;I'm guessing that the first one is running from the solenoid to the fuse
&gt;box
&gt; &gt;then to the ignition??? Any help is appreciated. Thanks ahead of time.
