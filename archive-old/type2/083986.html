Subject: why a stumble?

Volks,
I am looking for the cause of a stumble on my 78 2.0L FI (all stock).

The particulars follow;
3K on rebuilt by AVP
new wires, plugs, points (adjusted to 47 degrees dwell), cap, rotor.
Coil is not new
timing set to 7.5 before
adjusted valves to zero plus 1 full turn

I finally got around to adjusting the valves per AVP after running the
new motor for a while. I had a slight stumble before the valve
adjustment, but now I have a significant stumble. It is intermittent, at
all RPMs except idle, maybe a little worse under load. Distributor
advances to about 28-30 degrees at 2500RPM (timing jumps around a bit at
idle (6-9 degrees) and at 2500 (26-32 degrees)). I have an appt to put
it on an exhaust sniffer tomorrow morning to ensure I am within spec
there. It feels like a big misfire. Otherwise it idles smoother and when
not missing seems to run better then ever.

As usual, your help is greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance.
Regards,
Chris
