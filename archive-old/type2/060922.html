&gt; Hey Y'all,
&gt;   I was looking into the bilge blowers and this seens like a good and
&gt; cheap upgrade (the kind I like). The thing that I am wondering is what
&gt; size? The Detmar comes in two sizes 3 in 170cfm and 4 in 240cfm. Is the
&gt; 4 in 240 cfm to big or will this work good? Can the 70 Bus heating
&gt; system flow 240 cfm or would this be too much? I want the max flow with
&gt; out burning it up from trying to push too much air into too small a
&gt; hole. They are both $20 so price is not an issue. Does anyone have a
&gt; bilge blower in there bus, and what cfm rating is it? Hows it work?
&gt; Could it flow more or is it working to hard? Any input would be great,
&gt; I'm going to do this because I need the flow that I don't get at the
&gt; slow speeds that I drive. The only time the window defrosts is when I'm
&gt; on the freeway doing 60mph.
&gt;    I am also thinking of mounting them in the engine compartment like
&gt; the fans on the 72up Busses but bypassing the engine fan and drawing the
&gt; air in on each side above the engine compartment so I pull warm air from
&gt; inside the bus and resurculate it haeting it up faster. Any thoughts?

When the heater tube rusted out of my 69 about 20 years ago, I replaced
it with a piece of 2&quot; schedule 40 plastic dvw pipe. I just made it a
little long wiggled it in and then caulked all around it to glue it in.
Seems to me you could do the same thing with the fan, just add some 3&quot;
pipe with two 2-3 adapters and put the 3&quot; fan in the middle. Actually,
probably closer to one end so as to make support easier. I don't think
you'd gain much with the 4&quot; fan because an old bus's duct system is
approx. 2&quot; anyway. Somewhere either 72 or 73 they changed to 3&quot; which
they stayed with thru Vanagons. The factory Eberspacher replaces most of
this tube in the 74-79 models. When my gas heater in my 78 died due to a
leaky heat exchanger, I just replaced it with a  piece of 3&quot; dvw pipe-
it fit on with the same clamps that held the heater! Incidently, I think
that a booster fan is a really good idea. I had fitted a weld in one
under the front floor of a 70 once- sure cleared the windscreen well and
gave some relief from the cold. Sometimes in Iowa it dips down to 15 -25
below F., so for you guys and gals in the moss belt that might be all
the heater you need! In Iowa you know it's cold in the morning when you
jump into the car and the seat feels like it's made of cement!
Apparently the cold affects the foam padding about the same as
everything else- makes it stiff and brittle! I've noticed this
phenomenon mostly below 0 F., but it gets really noticeable around -15
F.
It just all depends on what you're used to.
