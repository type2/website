Subject: Re: runs fine until it warms up

Mike, I agree with JJ - Last year, at about this time, I had the same 
problem, too! Checked everything... It would be fine for about 7 blocks, 
then cut out - right around 10th and Redondo - every time!! What a PITA that 
was, pushing the bus out of the turn lane, over those HUGE rain gutter dips 
in the crossroads.

Anyway, I have the old double-relay harness if you want to take a 
look-see... Wait, there was some sort of relay switch that we replaced, too 
- that of course isn't being made anymore... I have the old one there too.

'79 Cali Transporter &quot;Chaco&quot;

&quot;I had this *exact* same problem with my '79 a few months ago. Temp
sensor
didn't have any effect on the problem for me, either. After monkeying
around
with all the same stuff you describe (cold start valve etc), I finally
traced the problem to a loose connection in the double relay harness.
Does
it start to idle poorly just before it completely dies? You might try
fiddling with the harness at this point, pressing the connection firmly
into
place, jiggling wires etc, and see if it makes any difference. In my
case, I
haven't gotten around the replacing the part(s) yet; I just zip-tied the
harness up tight to the relay case. Anyway, HTH and keep us posted-&quot;
