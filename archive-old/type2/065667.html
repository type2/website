Subject: Re: Jalousie Window Rubber

        If you guys are talking about the strip that covers the gap on the
top of the first window louver, then this is what I did.  When my father
replaced the windows on his house, I discovered that the old aluminum storm
windows had a rubber/vinyl seal under the edge of the frame that was screwed
to the window frame.  I was able to pull the seal out and use it to replace
the remains of what was left on my Westy.  That was 4 years ago and the
strip hasn't faded or cracked yet.  Only complaint is the minor traces of
paint that were the result of a crappy paint job on the house.  
        Having been in the replacement window business in the past, the
windows that we removed would often go back to the shop and be stripped to
the aluminum frame, which would be cashed in at the recyclers.  Lots of left
over rubber back then.
        Also have seen alot of these old windows on the side of the road
after the local community &quot;spring cleaning&quot; trash pickup.
        Another by-product of window installs was foam insulation that came
in 2 foot sections and round like a snake.  This stuff was stuffed in any
irregular gaps around window frames.  It also made a great replacement for
my deteriorated engine seal on my 78 Westy.  Has also lasted about 4 years.  

        Materials should be readily available from any window store or home
improvement center.  

Just my $.10 worth.
