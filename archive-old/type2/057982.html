Subject: Re: Solex Carb Manual

&gt;Just out of curiousity, does anyone have a copy of the a book titled &quot;Solex
&gt;Single and Double Barrel Down Draft Carburator Manual&quot; (or something like
&gt;that).

Ron,
  That book is out of print now (as you probably know).  You can go to 
www.amazon_dot_com and they will try to find the book for you (either new or used).
Search on Solex and you will get the following two hits.  
               1.   British Solex carburetters 

               2.   How to Adjust, Tune, Repair, and Rebuild Solex 2 &amp;4 Barrel
                    Downdraft Carburetors for Maximum Performance Shop

                                                   Janyce
