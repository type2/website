Aussie listmembers,

Do any of you know if the Tom Wilson book &quot;How to Rebuild Your 
Volkswagen Air-Cooled Engine&quot; is available in Australia?

It's available from Amazon_dot_com at US$13.56 but with exchange rates, 
post and packing, etc it will cost nearly A$60.

Hoping an Aussie out there can help.
