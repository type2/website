Subject: Re: [T2] Business case decision - 1.7 -&gt; 1.8 -&gt; 2.0 ??

At 04:07 AM 10/25/2003, you wrote:
&gt;(1) I have a  low mileage 1.7 engine in a '72    The engine needs both 
&gt;head work (#2 cyl - probably just burnt valve) and ring work (low 
&gt;compression in one cyl that comes up with oil spritz).  Bottom end is sound

If it is failing with low milage, then how do you know the bottom end is 
sound. Have you already torn it down and speced all the parts???? If I get 
junk results, I assume junk assembly. No partials in this situation. Get a 
proper reman motor.


&gt;(2) I came across a decent 1.8 engine (1974 model).  I covet the heads - 
&gt;this is the start of the dilemma

For a 1.8l engine, they are indeed the only way to go.


&gt;(3) I believe I can get a decent bottom end 1977 engine, no heads .

You speced out that bottom end so know it righteous, or just another 
wishfull assumption???


&gt;My rebuilder will include whatever size new P&amp;C I want at one price, and 
&gt;can do all but bore allign a Type IV case, i. e., open the heads; open the 
&gt;case.  He sends out the crank to the mid west somewhere.
&gt;
&gt;He is more interested in doing a good job than making money.  Over 28 
&gt;years rebuilding VW engines and still not rich.
&gt;
&gt;Costs:
&gt;
&gt;What ever way I go, the rebuild price is $1,150 plus a small extra for fly 
&gt;cut, open case, open heads. Includes new valves, guides, and new P&amp;C

Watch out, that's almost half as much as a motor with proper skills and 
parts to insure long life. Big compromises somewhere to be that low. 
Frankly, if the man who assembles the motor is not on personal terms with 
the machinist and have worked with each other many times in the past on VW 
engines, just a flag that has to cleared with lots of questions about 
specific details of all procedures and parts.

Are you happy with the idea of reusing as many used parts as possible to 
save money?? If yes, you can find cheaper. If no, they are too cheap to do 
it right with new parts.



&gt;The 1.7 is in my garage.  Cost zero.  The kicker:  the wife wants me to 
&gt;get the '72 1.7 running and sell it.  I can do that for about $100.

If it still has the original dual carbs/manifolds/linkage, I know someone 
who needs them. You might part it out and make more than selling, unless 
the chassis is unusually nice.


&gt;The 1.8 will cost $150, but I get decent heat exchangers and muffler 
&gt;setup, but no carbs [I have two sets of 32 - 34 PDSIT 2/3].    No chance 
&gt;to get just the heads (sorry Steve)
&gt;
&gt;The 2.0 bottom end will be about $50.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;What do I do??  I want to do it right, even for the next owner.

The highest value for the 72 would be stock 1.7 with stock carbs. Next 
would be any non stock you wish to try to sell to a smaller audience of 
buyers, all of them likely of Scottish descent.

Doing it right in my mind is a NW ConRod rebuild of the original 1.7. All 
other options add difficulties to getting it right. But if the chassis is 
poor, you wont get the price of the right motor for the whole finished 
projects. That's why GEX sells so many engines to those in the position to 
sell.

The only two options I think are proper and the least wasteful of 
time/money is do it right and keep it and use the value or liquidate it as 
is. I am sure you will get answers you like better. When it comes to German 
machine, I got no time/money to waste on warm and fuzzy. Pure logic is what 
makes them hum, and facts can be cold as ice.
