Steve,

I would like to clarify one miniscule point you made.
I refinish WHOLE trucks, not just the frames.
I do not spot repair anything, nor touch up rust spots.
I repair the affected area, and refinish, to better than factory
specifications.

This afternoon, I was replacing both of my batteries, and noticed a
scratch in the paint in the engine compartment.
I curiously got close to the scratch, and noticed a yellow-green color
under the paint.

Ah,Ha !!

VW had actually used a zinc laden primer under their paint !

Amazing !!!

I am shocked as well as appalled, that VW had the tenacity to use this
type of primer, and to think that it has managed to last 27 years
without turning to dust.

In life, as well as in business one learns from his mistakes, and
through experimentation.

Miracles in a can, I have tried, and tried, and tried.
Nothing can substitute doing doing body work, or refinishing, the
factory recommended way, ( or better) if you expect to experience long
term results.

And seeing as repairing rust, and/or performing body work,and
refinishing, is such a labor intensive job, I for one only want to do
the job once, and do it correct. 

Short cut the job, and you get short term results.

I don't want to be the grim reaper, but this is just a fact of life.

Good Luck,

  ______________
