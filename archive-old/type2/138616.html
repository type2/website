Subject: Maaco

I had Maaco paint a BMW325ic
. The color match was perfect. If you don't address every imperfection or 
fix the imperfection yourself they will spray over it. If it is not on the 
work order it will Not be taken care of. My best advise is to do some 
sanding and spot putty any imperfection you see. That wat you will get a 
exelent paint job for (in my case) $395. I had it painted to sell it and it 
worked. The imperfections that I did not fix ( like a chip on top of the 
trunk ) were not on the work order and sprayed over. I had no problem with 
the qualaty of the paint job. I wish I had done some pre work before having 
them spray it. It was a new franchise and were trying to do quality work to 
attract new customers. I just wish they would have explained everything to 
me before doing the job. For the price you can't beat them. Cree
