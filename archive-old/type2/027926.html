Hi Folks,
   I've found some conflicting info in the archives and so I come looking 
for recent, first hand experience from you.  I need to make a new interior 
floor in our 71 westy.
   1.  The dimensions of the old floor were 52 inches long by 60 inches 
wide, just a little bigger than you can get from one sheet of plywood.  I 
was thinking of using 2 pieces each 52 x 30 inches, but don't know of a good 
way to hold the pieces securly together, edge to edge.  Do you?
   2.  When I took out the old floor I measured a piece of the linoleum over 
plywood to be 1/2 of an inch thick.  The standoffs that the jumpseat mount 
to are 5/8 of an inch hight meaning they would hold the seat up off the 
floor an 1/8 of an inch.  Also there are small wood blocks that hold up the 
rear of the back seat and the blocks are 5/8 too.  Was that old floor just 
compressed and worn down from years of use or am I missing some thing?  What 
thickness do I really need?
   Please help as camping season is upon us and I need to get this done!
