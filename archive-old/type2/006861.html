Jay,

When I put my last engine in I had it drilled and tapped for full flow
oil cooling/filtering and ran into the same problem. I did have to notch
the rear mount. I used a Dremmel tool with a cutter wheel -- quite a few
cutter wheels. The metal that the cross member is made of is pretty
tough. I had some one hold the cross member up while I crawled under and
scribed about where I needed to cut. I took several additional trimmings
but I only wanted to remove what was necessary. I also had to put a
small window in the sheet metal that goes behind the pulley. When all
together for the last time I filled in the gaps with RTV sealant. 

The reason it fit in the Baja is that there was no rear mount.

Good luck,

BUT my problem is that the rear mount wont fit
because of the fittings for the external cooler. It seems the brass oil
fittings are in the way. My question is fairly obvious by now, and the
answer is probably just as obvious. Will I need to cut the rear mount?
If I
do, HOW? Both fittings are pointing to the left, and are on the left
side
of the engine.
Just a tidbit of info. . . this engine was supposedly from a baja. SO
how
did the previous owner mount this thing?
