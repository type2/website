Hi,

&gt; Do you have a 72-79 bus with power assisted brakes? If you're having
&gt; problems with idle when braking then it might be a vacuum issue.

I have a '71 1600 dp, with, I'm pretty surer, power assisted brakes.
I've got the large vacuum line coming off the left intake manifold
elbow heading toward the front of the bus.

I haven't done much inspection there, yet. I do know the brake booster
is working though, because when that bus stalls, boy is she hard to
stop.

&gt; Put a vac. gauge on it and watch what happens at idle when someone
&gt; presses the brake pedal.

Where exactly should I place the vacuum gauge to do this test?

Also, I'm thinking I might have worn throttle shaft bushings - while
tuning the carb I noticed that the idle speed often wanders or
fluctuates. I've heard this is a symptom of worn throttle shaft
bushings.

I've got 2 other carb's here, I'm just waiting on a carb rebuild kit.

Does anyone know where I can get a couple studs for the 34PICT3? The
ones that attach the carb to the manifold. Between the two spare carbs
I have there's only one stud.

I've noticed between the 3 Solex 34PICT3 carb's I've got they all have
vacuum ported from different locations in the back. The one on the
side is the same for all three but the vacuum porting on the back
varies. Why is that? I'll have to get all three side by side and post
a pic.



Thanks
peace
Jules
