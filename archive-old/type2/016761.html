        Since it's Friday, perhaps someone could explain what exactly is
wrong with the type2 server? I'm a long time sysadmin, it puzzles me
that you guys seem to be having so much trouble with it. Oh, I know,
probably if you knew *what* was wrong with it, it would be fixed, eh?
Uh, you aren't trying to run a webserver on NT or something crazy like
that are you?
