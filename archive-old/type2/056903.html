Subject: Georgia End of Summer Campout

Peach State Transporters is sponsoring a campout for all VW bus owners 
and their families at Duckett Mill Campground on Lake Lanier near 
Gainesville, GA, August 28-30th.

The park is located off GA Hwy 53 about halfway between I-985 and 
GA Hwy 400 near Gainesville, Ga.  

The campout is being held 2 weeks earlier than usual, so campsite 
reservations might be a good idea.  You can call for reservations at 
(770) 532-9802.

There is information for Lake Lanier Corp of Engineer campgrounds at:

http://www.sam_dot_usace.army_dot_mil/sam/op/rec/lanier/camp.htm

You can find all camping rates and rules &amp; regulations there.  I will 
post more info when I get back from New Mexico and Arizona in a couple 
of weeks.

Dave
