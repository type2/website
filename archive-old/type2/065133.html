Subject: '77 Westy STarts now (Bosch WR-1 Kit)

hey now,

well, i installed the bosch wr-1 relay? kit that stefan graciously sold
me. when i first looked at the directions, it looked very complicated. when
i went to do it, it took about ten minutes.

i started the engine on the first time! yeah! if anyone is interested i can
post all the gory details on monday.
