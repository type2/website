Subject: Front Vent Chrome Ring

Hiya All,

I have The Duck all finished on the outside.  Well, almost all finished.  New 
paint.  And the trim work has been buffed and reanodized.  However I cannot 
seem to get the front fresh air vent and its chrome trim ring to go easily 
into place.  The vent fits easily by itself.  And, when in place, there seems 
(eyeballing it) to be enough room around the edge for the trim ring.  But 
when the trim ring is fitted to the vent (and it's a good tight fit) it does 
not want to go in place without some force.  And I do want to use force and 
wind up scratching the brand new paint.  Any ideas, tricks, tips out there?

Mike
