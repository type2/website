Subject: Tach for 81

I have decided to not replace the clock on my 81 since I've already bought
one short lived used clock and plan instead to install a digital type tach in
the clock face. My idea is to drill right through that sucker clearing the
gas gauge and basically set it in the top half of the clock face which would
be blacked out. The old clock guts are of course cleared away before hand.

Anyone done this and care to offer better ideas or warnings?

Thanks,

Weston
