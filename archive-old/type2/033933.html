Subject: Re: snowwwwwwwwwwwwww!----and welding grounds

&gt;that and welding.  I tried to weld up some small holes in my front
&gt;floorboard...but it would be really jumpy and bird-terd ish because I
&gt;could not find a good ground to clamp on to.  what do you guys use for a
&gt;ground??
&gt;
&gt;thanks
&gt;Isaiah

You always want to ground as close to your weld as possible.  Electricity
will always take the easiest route and if there happens to be something
electrical in the way, or a bearing, passing large amounts of current
through it might fry it, or weld it together.

Where ever you clamp your ground, always clean the metal with some sand
paper.  And if you are using a wire feed welder, you will also need to
clean the metal you are tring to weld.  Rust is an insulator along with
paint and undercoating.
