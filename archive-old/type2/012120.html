    In China Cat (75 Westy) it was on the outside...in the front wheel
    wells. T he large bracket shaped roughly like an upside-down ham
    were rusty all round the bottom beam and up in front of the snubber
    boss that sticks out. the lower beam would have come adrift it the
    wheel hit a hard bump.

I did that (pulled the beam off) due to terminal rust and
an impact with a &quot;hard bump&quot; -- nearly to a panic stop
over a phone pole hitting the ground just ahead (in both
space and time) of me.  Almost missed it...
