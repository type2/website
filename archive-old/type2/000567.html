 Hi ALL.
I just took apart the insides of BLUE and am having trouble with the sink. I
want to clean it out( the pipes and all) and am not sure how to go about
this. I have the sink itself off and am just left with that U shaped tube
sticking up. How do i puor water and other cleaning solutions thru there and
make them go the route they should instead of just overflowing? Is there
some sort of vacum  thing im just not getting? and where does the water go?
i have a tank right below the water resovior, when i unscrew the lid to it
there is another stopper. I dont wanna pop it open and have water from 73
and who knows what gush out all over the drive. Anypointing in the right
direction would be appreciated!!!
