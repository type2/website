Subject: Re: [T2] any body have any experience with these swamp coolers/air
	conditioners?

Yes they do work well----

IF you live in the Gobi, Mojave, or Sahara desert---it must be a low
humidity area---

These swamp cooler's throw cool air derived from H20 into a wick which
is then blown into the Van,Bus---

At 99.9 humdity here in the Chicago area, I would be creating a steam
room effect iside the Bus.

Later,


Terry

I am thinking of buying one and would like to know if these things work
or not. It would be an expensive experiment.
