Subject: Re: [T2] Waste of a Splittie 

There is a ?1977? bus permanently parked
in front of a liquor store in Brighton,
Massachusetts, advertising &quot;Triple 8&quot;
brand vodka (distillery on Nantucket).
By &quot;advertising&quot; I mean a shiny paint
job and fancy curtains and all the stuff
to make it the equivalent of the VbubbleU
item that started this thread.  There may
be two of these as it used to be metallic
blue and now it is cherry red.

Yes, I buy that brand and for the simple
reason of the bus.  The vodka, as I recall,
is made from organic corn, but the bus
I am certain about.
