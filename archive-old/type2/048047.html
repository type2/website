Subject: RE: [T2] can't shift

&gt;so I turned the bus off and it shifts into all the gears just fine. 
&gt;I started it with the clutch in and in first and it wanted to die, 
&gt;but it didn't move forward. Then when I was on my way back home it 
&gt;was nearly impossible to shift into second and third gear. 

For one reason or another your clutch is not disengaging.  It could be as 
simple as adjusting your clutch (tighten the adjusting nut where the cable 
attaches to the clutch release fork on the transmission).  

If your clutch feels OK and appears to be properly adjusted then the only other 
possibility I can think of is that your pilot bearing is shredded and is 
binding on the transmission input shaft.  This happened on my 73 a few years 
ago and had the same symptons you describe.  This will require removing the 
engine to verify and fix since the pilot bearing is pressed into the tranny-end 
of the crankshaft.
