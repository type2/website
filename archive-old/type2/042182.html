Hi,
I've been lurking for almost ten months now and I've got to say that this list is the most important tool in my tool box.  Learning from others who have gone before me makes things so much easier.  Which leads me to my question.  How important is it that the oil pickup tube hold- down be attached to the 6mm stud??  I forgot to install the nut and washer before I mated the case and I really don't want to take it apart ...again :)  I tried for several hrs to fit one on but to no avail.  Just not enough room to work.(1 1/2 sump already installed).  Tomorrow I'll go and check out some looooooong needle nosed pliers with the curved tip...Hmmmmmm, always wanted some of those.  Maybe a medical suture clamp with a curved tip. Any thoughts??
I'm new to air cooled vw's(haven't even driven mine yet, ouch!) so go easy on me.  I expect to have this bus for a long time.
