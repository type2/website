Well, I'm back. And I'm busless...well sorta. I already have the title to my
next bus, but I don't have the bus and haven't payed for it, so me, God, and
the PO don't really consider it mine. For those of you who missed it, it's a
'67 westy complete, ~60,000 original miles...in better-than-Grendel condition. 

I was surprised to find that there's a smog inspection here in Memphis.
Guess there is in almost all of the bigger cities now. Ken, or anyone else,
I'd be interested in more details...like where you go, how long you have to
pass, $$$ maximums...what if'n I have a DP 1600 instead of the original
1500? &lt;--I do.

Now that I'm among the ranks of those who must suffer inspection, I'll just
echo the sentiments you've heard already:

&quot;It's a dadgummed conspiracy to get old buses off the road! It's a cryin'
shame. I like clean air and all, but they'll have to pry the bus from my
cold, stiff fingers (after severe oxygen depravation and carbon monoxide
poisoning, of course!&quot;

Nice to be back. Take care! 8) Joe
