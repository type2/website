I let a 1943 KDF beetle go last year and I also passed up on a 1960  rollback 
sunroof beetle ($300) go when I first moved to MD about 10 yrs ago  because I 
had no room.  
And when my ex wife said it was  either the Euro 74 911  Carrera  (slop nose) 
 or her, I should have buried her in the back  yard then.
