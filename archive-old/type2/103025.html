Subject: Re: [T2] Gas tank problem

&lt;&lt;  Today I pulled a beautiful gas tank out of a 69 Westy. It looks like 
it did the day it was built. I thought the tank was empty but when I removed 
it from the bus it was full of old gas. I poured out the gas but there 
remains inside the tank 1-1/2&quot; to 2&quot; of slug tar). The tank does not need to 
be patched or sealed just cleaned. Does anyone have any suggestions? Thanks a 
million.

Take it to a radiator/tank shop. They have hot tanks for cleaning and did
a much better, faster job than I could...After that, I used the POR-15 sys-
tem...But there, others may differ...BTW, this was on a '59 Healey tank
quite a few years ago and still no leaks, but YMMV...
