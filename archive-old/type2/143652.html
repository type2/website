Subject: Lucky Friday the 13th!

Hi Volks!
I've been in the new house for a week now, and the new commute is still taking some getting used to. Today, however, was exceptional due to seeing three bay window busses in traffic! The first was a red Westy (71?) heading toward Myrtle Beach. The second was a brown Rivi tooling around Wilmington. The third was a Cali styled red Westy (another 71?) outside of a local tattoo shop. 
I am lucky to see one bus in a month's time, but this Friday the 13th was pretty lucky for me! I hope that all of you had a lucky 13th as well.

Jamey Charlet
71 Westy -- 'Karla'
