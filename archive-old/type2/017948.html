I thought I took pretty good notes during disassembly but I seem to have
missed some details... The manuals all seem to consider this so simple
that there isn't a picture.

1976 Westfalia
    Accelerator pedal:  Does the long end of the spring bear against the
back of the pedal or against the floor?

    Steering column bearing:  There is quite a bit of play between the
ID of the bearing in the ignition switch/steering column casting and the
steering column.  It seems possible that the copper-colored stamping is
supposed to be driven partially into the bearing by the spring that is
located directly above.  Is this true or do I need a new bearing?

Thanks in advance for taking the time to stand on your head!
