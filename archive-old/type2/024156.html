&lt;&lt; I DID mean to post this to the whole list! heh...This was my last response
to my queries regarding Ramona's starting/not starting problem, and the
possibility that it is the coil.&gt;&gt;
 I like your answer best! (Because it's the simplest chore, but also because
it makes more sense.)
  Why don't I ever contemplate the simpler possibilities?? Yeah, the starter
was replaced some years ago (about 5), but it's a good one, Brazilian and sooo
shiny (at the time), and I replaced the ignition switch 2 years ago (still
have a perma-dent in my head from being upside down, balancing my brain on the
steering column for an hour and a half), besides I've tried the jiggling bit
and it doesn't go. The coil was switched out almost 2 years ago as well, but
when I reflect back on the dead coil situation with my old '68 Bug, this rings
true, symptomatically...
  But here's an old nemesis I have not wanted to face, and I have managed to
avoid since I adopted 'Mona 7 years ago; since her battery tray had long since
rotted out, looks like the PO had it moved to the left side, but did an ugly
job of extending the wiring across the top of the compartment, to reach the
new spot. Thus, midway, there is the splice-spot, gobbed with duct tape, which
I have not touched, but fear I should investigate.
  Guess I'm asking how difficult would it be to redo this? Again, I have
always been willing to tackle anything mechanical on Ramona, but wiring stuff
remains my Intimidator. The wiring travels the length of my Girl, yes? Where
does it all originate? The fuse box, yes?
  OK, well, good deal; I'll try the coil today. Please don't let it be the
regulator again!! That job was the truest beast - actually WORSE than changing
the starter in 100 degree heat whilst laying on a red ant hill. No lie.
 Thanks all for your input, and do feel free to keep the guesses/advice
coming! Oh, and I am still seeking body repair guidance...anyone? (Bay Area)
A Thousand Spanks,
