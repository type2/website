Subject: Re: [T2] Electronic Ignition Alternatives Question


&gt; I know there is Petronix and other brands of breaker points eliminators -
&gt; but has anyone modified a VW electronic ignition system to work with a '78
&gt; 2.0 Type IV?

There is nothing to modify to put the 79 Cal ignition in any typeIV bus
engine. It is a drop-in swap. Only tough part about it is moving the dist
drive about 90 degrees.

&gt; Not only would I like to eliminate the breaker points, I would like to add
&gt; a computerized ignition system that recognizes pinging and adjusts the
&gt; timing (when the coil is fired).

For this you would need a knock sensor system. I don't know of any that will
interact with the Bosch electronic ignition of 79-83 vintage. 80-83 Cal
Vanagons used an idle stabilizer to change timing at idle, but it had no knock
sensor.

&gt; I have heard about using '79+ electronic ignitions - but what years
&gt; specifically fit? '79 through '83?

79 -83 Calif version vehicles.
The 68-79 Bentley has a section on it. There is more info on it in the 80-85
Vanagon Bentley, starting on page 28.8.
&gt; I have heard that other brands of cars used Bosch internals that can be
&gt; retrofitted to a VW Type IV such as even Yugos. Anyone know of the brands?

Yugos used Bosch ignition. But no knock sensor. To use it in a VW, you have to
modify the housing to fit the VW case. But why?? You would gain nothing. The
factory VW system works as designed.

&gt; I have heard of building an ignition system using Chrysler replacement
&gt; parts and/or a ping detector/sensor (what is the REAL name for this
&gt; component) from a water cooled VW. Anyone know about this?

No clues.

&gt; I know that the ping sensor is constructed to recognize (tuned to) specific
&gt; frequencies so it does not trip on simple mechanical noises and the
&gt; aircooled engine is certainly a noisy beast... Which sensor and where
&gt; should it be located on  the engine?

No knock sensor is accurately tuned to tune out engine noises other than
pinging. You ought to see what happens to timing when a timing chain stretches
on a Mercedes V8 and starts tapping on the head! The knock sensors are mounted
at the base of the cylinders. The noise telescopes thru out the block. Even a
hydraulic lifter screws up the knock sensors.

&gt; I know that the aircooled Porsche had fancy electronic ignition systems and
&gt; there is a Corvair supplier that has a system for about $500 that is tuned
&gt; for the Corvair engine. It will adjust the timing for each cylinder.
&gt;
&gt; Sadly I don't have $500 for this gadget which is not tuned for a VW engine.
&gt;
&gt; I'd like to learn more about modern adaptive ignition systems if anyone
&gt; could lecture me on it a bit.
&gt;
&gt; Also I would not be afraid to do some reading on it if anyone could point
&gt; me in the right direction...
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!!!
