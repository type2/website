Subject: '76 Bus Destined for Crusher  Northern Virginia

No big loss ,,,

But if you are local Northern Virginia, this bus
has AIR CONDITIONING (some people out there are
looking for AC parts), very good middle and rear
seats (brown vinyl), unknown front seats, straight
body, relatively rust free, good windshield and
three vent windows (frames only slightly pitted,
and rubber is still workable)

The auto mechanic is planning to pull the engine
to put in a Porsche kit car (registered as a '66
VW, so no pollution requirements).  He does not
need the fuel injection; he has dual carbs. Don't
know about the transmission.

Auto mechanic has been into air cooled VWs in the
past (last rebuilt a VW engine in the '80's)

I want the two heat exchangers, exhaust, couple of
hubcaps, junk like that.

He said engine will be pulled Saturday, and the
carcass off his property on Monday (he has his own
tow truck!!)

Green and White.  Much surface  rust.  Repainted.
Tires are tired.  Last time registered was '91.

Address is Automotive Specialist Center 8418 Lee
Hwy., at corner of Prosperity and Lee Highway,
Merrifield (Across from the BMW dealer, and near
the post office.)

Man's name is Tim Minor, phone 703 573 2775.  He
is not overly friendly,   I suggest you show up
with cash and tools after he pulls the engine on
Saturday.  I will be there to try for the heat
exchangers, if they are solid.

Oh, yes.  He paid $250 for the bus, with the
intentions of pulling the engine and junking the
rest.  Anything you give him for extra parts will
be a wind fall.  Make him an offer for any parts
and it will probably be accepted.
