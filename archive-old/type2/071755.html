  As some of you may recall, a while back I posted the &quot;crank, Spit, Nada&quot;
plea for advice. I received many kind and insightful suggestions, and since,
we've tested Ramona each Monday...all to no avail.
  I believe it was Roland who suggested an electrical malfunction. With a
timing light, we tested the coil and got nothing, so we decided it must be the
coil and bought/installed a freshie. Crank, crank, I'm killing the starter,
crank, crank, nothing.
  Then we hooked our timing light up to the ignition wire going to the coil
and when we grounded it we got no light. No power to coil, we think.
  Muir suggests testing the ignition switch by making a jumper wire,
connecting one end to the reg. and the other to the ignition post of the coil.
At least, finally, we were rewarded with a lit timing light, which, we were
led to believe, meant a bad switch. But when we attempted to start her using
the jumper wire, still just cranking, not even a feeble attempt to turn over
at all; crank, crank.
  Brought us to the wires.( Remember, we'd replaced the spark plugs and wires
last we spoke.) Tried the Muir procedure for checking the plug wire and got no
spark there either. Having become conviced for the billionth time that we had
the wires on wrong, we messed with them again. *HERE*, I will ask that someone
please make this a simple explanation for me! In Muir's sketch showing the
rotor where it matches the line in the rim of the distributor, the line in the
rim of the dist. should be, by illustration, closer to me as I hunker at her
ass, no? I ask because the notch on my dist. faces more towards the front of
the bus, away from me. Because of this, we cannot be at all sure if we've got
the wires on the cap correctly. Why, oh why, does the line/notch on the rim of
my dist. appear to be facing in the wrong bloody direction?!?! Curses.
  OK, bear in mind that although we (think) we've discerned the ignition
switch needs to be replaced, we keep the jumper wire connected as we cont.
checking other things.  Is this OK?
  We followed Muirs instructions to check the points and the light stayed on
continuously, at which point Muir says to take of the dist. cap and have a
looksee. Cap looks good, points look fine to me. My partner removed the rotor
so we can have a better look and so I'm poking my face down in there to see
the action of the points opening and closing while I hand-crank the motor.
They're moving and with the feeler gauge the gap seems right on. Then I see
something that appears to be rambling around in there. I fetch my magnet and
draw out a small piece of metal(!). After examing a new set of points and
condensor, we can't tell where it'd come from and then Katey picks up the
rotor and we can see that it sits right in the lip of the neck of the rotor.
So it musta come out when she yanked it outta the dist., and so we've that to
replace.
  Otherwise, things looked right and we tested the condensor, with the points
open. The problem was that Muir's direction on this little procedure is a bit
hazy when he says &quot;...and hold the wire that goes from the dist. on the base
clip.&quot; Base clip??? Wha'? Sew, we hooked the wire from the dist. back to the
coil terminal and clipped the end of the test light right on it then touched
it to the wire that goes from the condensor to the points. The timing light
came on and if this test was done right this means the condensor's shot, which
we will replace, along with the points, after I ask you this: do we remove the
whole dist. to do the job? Muir makes it sound so, but in his procedure for
doing this he says to make sure your rotor is lined up to fire on #1 before
you take the dist. off, but we stopped there because, as I mentioned above, we
don't think that part of things is jiving, like we've got the wires messed up,
and why's that line in the dist. rim facing in and not out like John says it
ought to??
  I know this is a ramble, but we can't figure a thing. She doesn't even try
to fire anymore and so much is screwy. Should we have replaced the ig. switch
before moving on?
   By the way Ramona is a '71,1600 DP, stock everything.  Replaced coil, spark
plugs and wires, all fuses, and battery.  ALL FOR NOUGHT!!!!!!!
    Sorry if this is confusing.  If you have any questions, I'd be more than
happy to help you help me.  :)
  Thanx Rachel, Kate, and Mona
