X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

I used a 2.29$ euro type terminal block from radio shack. The whole thing
only took around 1.5-2 hrs even with the thinking part.

Turned out nice and clean. That thing squeaks pretty loud because I can
hear it up front with the engine idling. Actually seems to run smoother on
my short test run. I opted not to open the plugs up though, just in case 
of failure it would be one less step in troubleshooting.
One more plug for john at aircooled_dot_net (87.00 shipped).
