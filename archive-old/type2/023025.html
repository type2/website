&gt;Is it possible to put a later vanagon 5 speed tranny with the 2L engine in

I'm not sure what trannies you're talking about.  Vanagon trannies (80 and 
up) shift on the side of the trans instead of through the nose like 
baywindow busses, making them very difficult to install.  Also I thought I 
heard that the only 5-speed ones were in the diesel and that the 5 speeds 
cover the same range as the 4 speeds in the gas-engine trannies.  That is 
all second hand info so someone please correct me if I'm wrong.

I also have a 2-liter in an earlier bus (73).  When the web pages are 
available again, you might want to search the archives on this subject, but 
here's a summary.  The 76-79 trannies are geared taller but are physically 
1&quot; longer and although you *may* be able to force them into place, they 
will not fit correctly.  As a partial fix you can run the 210 or 215mm 
flywheel, clutch and bellhousing from 75 and earlier busses with 002 
transaxles with the 091 trans and only have 1/2&quot; of extra length.  This 
will fit and work acceptably although it is a tight fit and your gearshift 
knob will be closer to the drivers seat than it was before.

The best solution IMO is to obtain a late 74 through 75 002 transaxle with 
the 4.86 final drive and then swap in a .82 4th gear in place of the stock 
.88.  This will give you a 4th gear ratio approximately equal to the later 
busses but with a lower 1-3 gear.  I like this solution because I value a 
low first gear ratio.  I actually drove up a road once that was so steep I 
couldn't pull it in first gear (in Wyoming, dirt/rock logging road, 8,000ft 
elevation, 27&quot; tires).  A lower first gear is also easier on your clutch 
with a loaded down bus or starting on hills, and helps in that emergency 
situation where you have to pull someone out of a ditch.
