&gt; &gt;On our way to Everybus this year, Wal Mart security freaked out when
&gt; &gt;our caravan of 11 buses rolled into their parking lot! One of our
&gt; &gt;group overheard security being told to order us off their property!
&gt; &gt;When we informed them we were there as customers they lightened up,
&gt; &gt;but I sure wouldn't try to spend the night in one of their parking
&gt; &gt;lots-although I do see a lot of big motor homes in the lot of the
&gt; &gt;one in town.

They seem to be cool if you are there to quietly spend the night and park
by yourself in their lot.  However, they would understandably get
nervous if a group pulled in that looked in the least like it might raise
a little ruckus.  Drum circles aren't their style!
