Subject: Re: [T2] Just like that, BOOM! Another setback..

From: &quot;78vwbus&quot;

 I also have a post running around about a bad hesitation after partial
rebuild... I tried an SVDA distributor and got the plug wires wrong and BOOM!! The mother of backfires.....
Heres what it did...
Hopefully that is all it did...   What else could that have damaged...??
Well time for a new one I guess, wait, that one WAS NEW!!!!  Less than 20 miles on it...
Is it normal for a backfire to do this? Granted it was big, but gosh, it
knocked me back a few feet...
I was sitting right there with my hand on the dizzy when she blew...  Had my girlfriend turning the key..
Im still limping a bit, it got me pretty good...    Ill live to wrench another
day, hopefully better this time...

Since you have a 78 bus and that muffler is from a type 4 engine without a catalytic converter.....  do you
still have fuel injection on it?

If yes, did you put hose clamps on all the hoses that connect TO the big S hose and TO the decel valve?

If no, then they probably all blew off like they should when you have a backfire.

If yes, then you probably destroyed your AFM. The backfire comes back thru the air vane and bends it. Someone
a while had a picture of his AFM where the force of the backfire blew the AFM apart, broke the rivet holding
it together!

Yes, a spark at wrong time will cause this. If a exhaust valve is open it blows out the exhaust, if an intake
valve is open it blows thru the carb/FI.
This is why you never put hose clamps on the air/vacuum hoses except on the ends of the big S hose.
