&gt;Here is what I have been considering, and would like

&gt;thinking that I might get this, an inverter, and
&gt;a second battery, probobly a marine deep cycle. I would

&gt;heat the bus up initially, b) plug into the inverter
&gt;while driving as a supplement, not a replacement, of

Won't work.  15 amps at 110 volts would require about 150 amps
at 12 volts (you can think of it as amperage going up as voltage
goes down).  Your aux battery would last all of 10 minutes at
that kind of drain, plus a 1500 watt inverter would cost a couple
hundred dollars.

&gt;I would like to set it up to run only off the aux battery
&gt;but use the alternator to charge the aux batt as well.
&gt;Is this possible? Also does anyone know how many *spare*
&gt;amps I have. For example IF my alt (these numbers are
&gt;hypothetical, and I will gladly take any info on the
&gt;real numbers to replace them) puts out 50 amps, and
&gt;when running all of my available accesories (lights,
&gt;wipers, radio, etc) they only pull 35 amps, this
&gt;would give me 15 amps to spare. RIGHT?

Maybe.  If you have the stock alternator it is 55 amps.  I tend to
think that is a continuous rated capacity, but others on this
list disagree with me, and I have nothing to back up my case.
With lights, heater blower, and wipers on you probably don't have
a lot of current to spare, but during most other times I think you
can assume you have 30 amps of spare capacity.  Of course, your
second battery will only take that 30 amps for a few minutes.  As
it charges up, it will take less and less.  I have found that most
batteries will draw between 8 and 15 amps until they are nearly
fully charged.  More at first, but the curve will flatten out at 8-15
amps as the battery voltage stabilizes.  Thus, you can't judge how
fast your aux battery will recharge by looking at how much your
alternator puts out.  I think if you tried to charge a battery faster
than 15 amps for any length of time it would heat up and possibly
fry itself anyway.  I suspect Bob Hoover might have something to
say on this topic.
