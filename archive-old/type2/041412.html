Subject: RE: June Bug Jam in Ridgecrest

My apologies to all on the list. I failed to state clearly the location of 
the event. It is in Ridgecrest, California in the high desert north of Los 
Angeles by about 150-200 miles. It is near where US 395 and State Highway 14 
meet in Inyokern. So sorry for the big OOPS!
Dana
