Subject: Re: [T2] Trailer Advice

Gentlepersons-
                      Any chance an old brake drum from a bus could be 
drilled to accept 
bolts mounting it to the trailer and then leaving VW studs for mounting? Sort 
of like
using the drum in the same way that a wheel adaptor allows other wheels to be 
mounted on VW hubs? Might require machining off the inside of the drum to 
provide
clearance and lightening, leaving just the stud face.
