I am in Boone now, I got up here this evening and am staying at Jennifer 
Murphy's home and will be out at the campground tommorow.  I will not be 
able to check emails again, so if something comes up, call the campgound and 
leave a message for me.

The mountians are looking grand!!!!!  I cant wait to see all of you here
