Subject: A Christmas Treat for someone...

Howdy!

I'm coming out of lurk mode to put forward an offer to the folks on  
this list, devoted bus-lovers all.

Several years ago I came into the possession of a 1970 EuroWesty.  I  
love it, I enjoy it, I did work on it.

Then a partner came into my life who has a (not-entirely irrational)  
fear of sitting out in front of a vehicle without an engine block in  
front to protect their ankles.  So, the EuroWesty has not gotten much  
use over the last three or four years.

After returning from a camping trip with the faithful beast a couple  
of years back, I pulled the points in the course of doing a tune-up,  
and got called away.  I still haven't finished the tune-up, so the  
beast has not run in a couple of years.  It's still registered and  
insured, however.

Now we're planning a major remodel on our house, and the lovely bus  
is unused and, frankly, in the way.

So, I'm putting word out on this list to see if anyone has a good  
home for this beast.  To keep the DMV happy in any transfer stuff, I  
should probably charge some nominal fee... perhaps for the ridiculous  
stereo a car-audio-enthusiast friend of mine put in a few years back  
(iPod ready!).  But in principle, I want to give the beast away to a  
good home.

We're located in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Pictures of the beast  
itself can be seen at http://www.loafingjoe_dot_org/70ew.htm

Here's hoping there's a Westy enthusiast out there who'd like this  
beasty in their lives!

					Bob
