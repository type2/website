Subject: I don't like the VW Classic
Message-Id: &lt;199906140942.CAA10889_at_helix.ucsd_dot_edu&gt;

For the second year I have gone to the VW Classic and come away less 
than satisfied. Last year I didn't own a bus, this year I do. Didn't 
make any difference. I wouldn't complain, except that $15 admission fee 
is a lot of money for too little in return.

The worst thing is that I cannot put my finger on why I don't like the 
Classic. It's not just that the show is dominated by upright engines 
(though it is). Or that many of the best baywindows stay parked out in 
the lot, rather than being shown (though they do).

I guess it's that there are not enough Mike Benthins and Matthew Bulleys 
showing vehicles that are fine tuned by experimentation, some 
craftsmanship, and a whiff of inspiration.

It's nice to see a complete SO-23 interior in a splitty, right down to 
the tumbler set. But when it comes to late model bay Westies, who gives a 
damn about strictly stock? There's plenty of stock in the boneyards. 

Maybe the purpose of shows like the Classic isn't to learn something. But 
it could be. I think that for $15 (and $3 for a Pepsi) I should have come 
away with an idea for my bus. And I didn't.

The Classic didn't inspire me last year, and it didn't inspire me this 
year.

That's enough of that.
