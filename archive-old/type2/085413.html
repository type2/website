Subject: Re: [T2] RE: alternative heat source

Don't forget the SouthWind heaters.  They put out more BTU's and CFM of hot
air than the BN4's.  These heaters are also easier to get parts for, cheaper
to buy and are more plentiful.  They were installed and serviced by the VW
dealers here state side.  They are MUCH simpler than the BA6 and are much
smaller too.  SouthWind has been putting gas heaters in everything from
tanks to airplanes for over 70 years.

&gt; 
&gt; Yeah thats great and all but I umm sort of live in Northern Virginia and
&gt; doubt I'll be hunting for bus parts in Alaska any time soon. But thanks for
&gt; the tip. I am still deciding between the BA4 and BA 6 and a new Espar
&gt; heater. My brother is a dealer for Espar in Annapolis and installs them in
&gt; boats, however they run on diesel. I got fairly decent heat from my stock
&gt; system with a bilge blower. But the gas would really make things toasty and
&gt; I could run it with the engine off while camping.  Lots of pros and cons
&gt; here.
&gt; 
&gt; BA4 more readily available? Parts easier to find?
&gt; BA6 more BTU easier to install in a '78 Westy
&gt; Espar brand new, reliable, easy to get serviced, diesel safer than gas...
&gt; BA4 have to relocate aux battery and do a lot of cutting and welding to
&gt; install
&gt; BA6 have to find one first then hope I can get everthing else I would need
&gt; for a stock looking install.
&gt; Espar $$$, have to also install a diesel tank and all the plumbing for fuel
&gt; and exhaust...
&gt; 
&gt; In the end I'll probably just end up buying more sweaters :-)

&gt; If you ever drive to Alaska, and you see a dead bus sitting in a yard,
&gt; pull over and take a look in the engine compartment.
&gt; 
&gt; Those dead buses up there just about all have heaters in them waiting to be
