Subject: Re: [T2] will it go faster this way?

I am only 6'0&quot; and when I drive the 66 I have to lean forward to see through the windshield. I f I sit up straight I am too tall to see through the glass! This why I cannot see how anyone can chop a bus roof and still be able to drive it!

Hey everyone!   Happy Friday!!!

Time for Fridays crazy question...
Why is it that when you see someone driving a bus down the highway at full speed,  they are always leaning so far forward that their head is almost hitting the windshield?  When I used to drive my 67 deluxe down the highway in California, I found myself doing the same thing!  Surely the seat is far enough forward in a bus to be able to &quot;sit back and enjoy the ride.&quot;  I think bus owners deep down inside believe that if you lean far enough forward, your own body weight will somehow make you go faster!  Try this theory out on the highway sometime.  When you find yourself starting to lean, are you saying &quot;Come on Bessie, you can do it!&quot;? Once again, questions, comments and stories welcome.
