Subject: Westy interior options and layouts

Volks, 
Sean Bartnik asked me about westy layouts.  I have seen a bunch throught
the years, but have trouble linking year/cabinet level/cabinet location.
If y'all could help, I would love to get a complete list of the
split/loaf/brick interior options among the group members.

Sean,

I don't know all the combos, but here is what I do know....

'73 - The &quot;suicide&quot; Westy
      sink/cooler cabinet behind passenger seat
      jump seat behind driver seat
      table against driver side wall.
      bed/seat located to driver side of bus
      clothes cabinet located on passenger side from behind sliding door
      to rear of bus. creating a &quot;semi-&quot; sized blind spot :-(
      Poptop hinges at front and has a cot

I advise strongly against this interior, mainly because the clothes
cabinet blocks your view out the passenger rear quarter.  I have seen a
~'73 with a cut down clothes cabinet, to avoid this blockage, but then you
have no storage space at all :-( In addition, I am ~90% sure there was not
a stove option. 

'75   Pat' Flynn's '75 has an electric fridge behind the passenger seat, 
      a stove/sink behind the drivers seat, 
      the bed/seat is to the passenger side
      and the closet is behind the driver in the rear.  
      I forget where the table is.

I like Pat's layout quite a bit.  It is a bit cramped, but quite
functional.  His stove/sink cabinet only goes up to the top of the
seatback.  I have a vague memory of seeing a similar van with a full
height cabinet there, which I would prefer.  More storage space is always
better.  I prefer the clothes cabinet on th eleft out of the driver's line
of sight.  I also believe that at least the '75 came in &quot;standard&quot; and
&quot;deluxe&quot; interior layouts, as I have seen '75's that resemble my '76.

'76   The &quot;linear&quot; layout.  
      All cabinets proceed back along the driver's side
      First is the sink/(optional) stove cabinet, then
      the icebox/storage box cabinet, next to 
      the bed/seat cabinet behind the passenger seat and 
      a short clothes cabinet behind the driver in the rear of the bus.
      the table is on an arm attached to the rear corner of the sink cab.
      the passenger seat rotates to face rearward and the table can be set
      so three can eat (as you did :-)
      Poptop - mine is a hardtop (Howdy, Jean-Baptiste!), but the poptop 
      for this year hinges at the rear and contains a full double bed

I like this layout.  With a gas stove (coming this weekend :-) and a gas
fridge (no time soon :-( it would be ideal.  My complaints are minor. 
There is no place to store the table when it is not mounted, and VW for
some reason says to dismount it befor driving. The driver side clothes
cabinet is too short for my duster to hang in and the cubby hole clothes
storage in the back is less convenient than the big door in the '73.  I am
also a Luxury lover and want that gas fridge real bad.

Hardtop Vs Poptop - While I am sure I will miss the ventilation next
summer, so far I have not missed the poptop half as much as I had expected
I would.  I never slept in the '73's cot as it was too short for me.  The
ability to stand was great, but I have cooked in boats, so I am used to
&quot;full crouching headroom&quot;  :-)
