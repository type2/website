Subject: Re: bleeding brakes (ho, ho, ho!!)

I got a deluge of replies (must be close to X-mas :), all in private
(suggesting all this is common knowledge?) Thanks much to all the usual
suspects (Sean Bartnik, Steve Dolan, Doktor Tim, Dan Soiney, David Wolf,
Seth Avant, Andy Pechenik, and John Anderson)!

I'm posting to the list just so everyone knows the question already got
plenty of attention and further replies will not be needed. Here's a quick
cut'n paste patchwork of replies:

(1) It is likely that the master cylinder is simply airlocked.  Master
cylinder should be bench-bled (or primed) before installation. One
suggestion was to immerse it in a pan of fluid and pump it manually until
bubbleless, then wipe the mess and install. But since mine is already
installed, loosen the union nut on the master cylinder for the line that
goes to the rear and pump the pedal until air stops spitting out of there
and fluid starts dripping out. If neccesary crack the line into the dive
regulator on the frame.

(2) Check flex lines for obstructions; Remove bleed screw to check for
restriction.

(3) Use a vacuum pump to get it started. Use a Mityvac ($30 Walmart)  to
pull the air out and go from there. A little silicon grease around the
bleeder threads will help you get a good vacuum.

(4) Make sure shoes are adjusted first.

(5) It's usually best to start at the wheel farthest from the M/C.
