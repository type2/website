Subject: Re: [T2] On a hunt for used 74 parts. (help me get to HCBF cont.) 

&gt;&gt;I also don't have the foam seal that goes between engine and body.
Can I live without it?  Can I just cut up an old matress or something?&lt;&lt;

Jay,

i think that seal is important for cooling. i think i remember someone
saying they successfully used an old bike innertube as a temporary
replacement. check the archives.

hope that helps,
