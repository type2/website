Hey yall
I'm on the road in Santa Fe. On the way here the wire to the high 
beam/dimmer relay pulled out of its solder and shorted out, thus blowing the 
dimmer relay (and the headlights). I have since gotten a new relay and the 
headlights work fine, though not the hi-beams. I found a used turn signal 
relay here, which I'll have to take off a bus myself. The guy wants $60. - 
Is that a good price? I looked and it looks like it would be difficult to 
re-solder that wire back - can't even see where it came out from. Plus the 
whole unit moves all around the steering wheel already (has since I bought 
it) and the cancelling ring doesn't work. So I would like to replace it any 
way.

So is that a decent price? Should I instead spring for the $120-$150 for a 
new one? Any tips on replacing it (in addition to Muir and Bently?)
Thanks All
Wink
