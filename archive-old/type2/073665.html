Subject: Re: [T2] How to undercoat a bus?

I would vote against undercoating an old Bus (or almost any old vehicle).
I tend to think it's almost impossible to not encapsulate some/lots of
moisture/rust on the underside of the vehicle. Even &quot;new&quot; vehicles suf-
fered from these effects when undercoated...The qualities that favor
undercoating, are the same ones that mitigate against it. Also, under-
coating might block many of the drainage holes in the underside, again
creating a perfect environment for the rust worm. POR-15, properly
prepped and applied, would be my choice -YMMV - It seems to resist
the road hazards (stones, debris, etc.) that cracks the protective
surface that undercoating offers. I've seen any number of vehicles
with dangerous rust outs well-hidden by undercoating. I'd vote for
frequent cleaning (fresh water and a lawn and leaf blower drying) and
close inspection rather than undercoating.
