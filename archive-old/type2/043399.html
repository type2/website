&gt;Just a note that I now have bus fuel filler necks back in stock.  This is
&gt;the large rubber &quot;elbow&quot; that attaches to the fuel filler opening on the
&gt;side of the bus.  Unavailable for several years.
&gt;
&gt;Price is $39.95.  Part number is 211 201 119.  It will be on the website
&gt;tomorrow, or you can order by part number toll free at 1-888-819-DEPOT.


 Ron can you,or any other wise VW person confirm whether this filler
 neck is also the one suitable for Double &amp; Single Cabs ?

 Given that the filler hole &amp; the tank are in a different position
 to the vans it may not be the same but then again sometimes VW did
 some smart things...:)

 Thanks,
 Steve O.
