Subject: RE: Possible relocation to PA

Mike,

I live in the Philly area, west of the city.  Your bus is 26 years old and
so it would be completely exempt from all smog checks, as is any vehicle 25
years old or older in PA.

However, assuming you do not register it as an antique or classic, you will
need to have the yearly state safety inspection - which emphasises brakes,
lights, etc.  These inspections are done by privately owned and operated,
licensed state inspection stations - which includes most auto repair shops.

In this area (Delaware County) there is an excellent VW shop very close to
where I live and he is a licensed state inspection station.  I have been
dealing with them for over 20 years and they always treat me right.  They of
course do mainly water cooled, but air cooled was how they started and they
have not forgotten a thing. It's a bit far from the area you are thinking
of, but still might make sense if you needed help sorting out any mysteries
with your bus.

There's a possibility that we might be relocating to eastern Pennsylvania
sometime in the next 12 months.

Is there anything that I need to know about the bus and smog checks, etc.
before I attempt to take the bus up there to the Philadelphia area
(Langhorne, Bristol Township, etc.)?

Thanks!
