Subject: 78 bus won't start   mystery wire?  

By #3  here is a link:

http://www.kodakgallery_dot_com/PhotoView.jsp?&amp;collid=930947213105.790629523305.1139291672428&amp;photoid=690629523305&amp;amp;view=1&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;sort_order=0&amp;amp;albumsperpage=12&amp;amp;navfolderid=2006

This is my first attempt at uploading a pic, let me know if you can't 
open it?

Any ideas what this wire would go to?  is it stock?

thanks in advance

dan
