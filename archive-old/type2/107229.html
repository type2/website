&gt; I have had a Petronix ignition in my bus for the past month or so. I set the
&gt; gap with the little plastic piece that came with the kit. When I set the
&gt; timing and checked the dwell it sits steady at 42 degrees. I know this is at
&gt; the bottom of the recomended dwell settings for used points. I am wondering
&gt; what others with the Petronix ignition have set the module gap at? Has any
&gt; body tried different gaps and seen any improvement?

It was debated earlier that changing the gap makes no difference. The dwell
should be about 54 degrees with Pertronix at idle. Not sure why your reading
is so low.
