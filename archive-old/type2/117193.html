Subject: Fuel Line Replacement - '74 &amp; Earlier Bus w/ Carburator

I have written up a technical article for fuel line replacement of '74 &amp;
Earlier Buses w/ Carburators.  Please advise if there are any suggested
improvements before I post it to the library!

Thanks for recommending this one Billy!  It was so easy, I don't know why I
waited so long!!!!

Fuel Line Replacement - '74 &amp; Earlier Bus w/ Carburator
By Shawn Luft, with help from Billy Price's FI line replacement article.
Copyright (C) 2003, Shawn Luft.

Job: Complete Fuel Line Replacement

Application: '74 &amp; Earlier Bus w/ Carburator

Symbols:
- mm  millimeters

Parts:
- 3 feet of 7.5 mm low pressure fuel line (recommend one w/ the cloth
covering)
- 2 feet of 5 mm low pressure fuel line (recommend one w/ the cloth
covering)
- 6 clamps, size #4
- some wire for extra security (optional, but highly recommended)

Tools &amp; Supplies:
- One flathead screw driver
- Something to cut the fuel lines
- Fire extinguisher (just in case)

Total time required:
- Approx. 15 mins

Notes:
- When replacing fuel lines, I suggest just removing the original hose,
then cut the new one to the same size using the old as a template.
- You may disconnect the battery and drain the tank for added fire safety.
I feel as long as you avoid open flame there shouldn't be any problems.



   1. Remove &amp; replace lines from carb to the fuel filter using 7.5mm hose.
Don't forget clamps!!

      Minimal amount of gas will spill out from the line.  It will
evaporate quickly.
      You can collect this in a pot if you wish, however I just let it run
off.

   2. Loosen clamp on fuel filter for the fuel line running to the fuel
pump.
      This will make it easy to pull the hose out when you're under the
bus.

   3. Climb under bus

   4. Remove &amp; replace line from fuel pump to the fuel filter using 5mm
hose.  Don't forget clamps!!
      You can attach the hose to the fuel filter when you're back on top of
the bus.
      Make sure to push it through the hole so you can grab it when you're
back at the engine.

   5. Remove &amp; replace line from the tank to the pump, using 7.5mm hose.
Don't forget the clamps!!

   6. Get out from under bus, and return to engine bay.

   7. Attack the hose that runs from the fuel pump to the fuel filter.
Don't forget the clamp!!

   8. Check for leaks in all 6 clamped areas.  Attach safety wire while
you're at it!


That's it!  Now you can feel safe knowing you've personally changed &amp;
inspected all fuel lines.
