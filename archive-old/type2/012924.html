My new muffler is basically a flange to flange model, with an extra 
bit put on, for some reason. I plan to seal that up. However, it is 3/4 
of an inch out of being perfectly lined up with the heater box 
headers, I noted I may be able to make tiny adjustments to every 
single coupling in the system and gain what I need.

The only thing was the old system was a large Y ending at a flange 
to install an inadequate muffler. This one tucks nicely underneath, 
so I would like to make this one work.

Am I thinking in the right direction, or on the path to disaster by 
over straining old pipes?
