Subject: Broken Wiper Handle
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I broke the wiper switch on the column off (opposite the turn signal)
on my 73; the ol screwdriver in the broken plastic empty socket lasted
about 4
weekends here in wet San Francisco.  I have checked several Bay Area
Grave/junkyards for parts, but every setup is mounted on the dash like
the headlights, not the
steering column.

Can I rewire my column mount to a dash knob, or do I need a column
mount?  What is the best way to fix this, the platic on the inside is
shot, the wires going into it are fine.

Thanks for your advice, I appreciate the wisdom of the individuals and
the list.
