Subject: Removing rear brake &amp; bearing housings on 78 Westy

Hey folks--
I'm in the process of getting ready to sandblast the rear underside of my bus
(engine compartment and tranny area) and was wondering whether I should
 remove the rear brakes and bearing housings or just to wrap them extremely
well.  Is it as easy as it looks to just take out the 4 bolts and pull it off
or am I missing something.  Please give me any advice you can offer.  I have
the engine, tranny, axles, gas tank and shocks out.  Is the wiring in any
danger?  Any advice on the sandblasting would be appreciated as well.

Thanks, Ned

PS Please respond directly as I miss some of the digests.
