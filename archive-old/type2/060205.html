Subject: Re: vw theft prevention

An idea to prevent theft:

I had a friend who would remove the rotor from the dizzy when he didn't
like the neighborhood.  Took less than 1 minute, and there's little chance
that the potential thief would happen to have one with him AND know that
that was the problem.
