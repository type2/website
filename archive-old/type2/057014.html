Subject: Re: GAS HEATER LOCATIONS

Hi Volks

I have both a 76 Westy (no gas heater) and a 78 Westy (BA6 gas heater)
I plan to put a BN4 in the engine compartment of the 76 probably in
september.
So I'll let you know what I have to do to make it fit...
I actually rebuilt the heater last fall (as well as a BN2) but never quite
got around to putting the heater in... The BN2 will end up in a Beetle...

A few observations from here in the rust belt:
- Both busses have always lived in Vermont
- The 78 is not safe to drive due to under chassis rust
   to the point of cross members crumbling in your hands
- The 76 although a little rusty is still solid
- I surmise that the BA6 which is mounted underneath
  and keeps the interior of the bus warm, also loses a small
  amount of heat under the bus and gives the ROAD SALT
  a helping hand in destroying the bus chassis faster.
  And yes the &quot;belly pan&quot; for the heater was still there.
  Splashing snow/slush/salt have a way of getting 
  into places you would not think of.
- I guess I should also say that the BA6 components
  (fuel pump, etc are also rusted to the point of being useless.
- So,  ...my feeling is that the 76 and the BN4 will live longer with a 
  BN4 in the engine compartment.

I'll let you know how the BN4 install in the 76 goes.

Take Care,
