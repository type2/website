&gt; How much better does Fiberglass keep heat out of the

&gt; Thanks...KR

Since it is simply a plenum and duct for the air that does the cooling, I
wouldn't expect to see any difference in heat.  Very little heat is passed
outward by the fan shroud (try touching it when the engine is warm and
running)

Good quality fiberglass holds up very well.  Unfortunately, &quot;good quality&quot;
is sometimes difficult to judge, so stick with reputable suppliers.
