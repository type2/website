&gt;Pat Callaghan was looking for propane suggestions.
&gt;If cost is the main drawback of the small bottles.....adaptors are 
&gt;available to fill small bottles from regular [5 gal, etc] tanks, tho the 
&gt;small ones usually say 'not refillable', i've a friend been doing this for 
&gt;years. reckon he'd be happy to share his experience, if your interested, 
&gt;contact me direct and i'll give you his phone #.

The adapters you speak of are illegal and unavailable, at least that has 
been my experience over the last 20 years.  That being said, if you can 
braze you can make your own adapter.  I still have the one my dad made in 
the '70's.  If you go through a lot of those little bottles, it can be 
worth your while.  The bottles don't last forever though - I've found that 
the valves start to go after a few refills.

OBC: I'm considering removing the built-in tank on my bus in order to 
increase ground clearance and reduce weight.  I rarely use the stove and my 
fridge is electric.  I bought a Coleman regulator that screws into the 
small bottles and has a hose coming out the other side.  I figure I can use 
this to run my stove from small bottles when the need arises.  I've also 
been considering making a removeable stove, since I'm starting to agree 
with those who say that removeable stoves are better.   The reasons they 
give for being better are a) you can cook on the picnic table if you feel 
like it, and b) you can remove the stove if you don't need it, giving you 
more space in the camper.  And as we are all painfully aware, space is at a 
major premium.
