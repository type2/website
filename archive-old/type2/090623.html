Subject: Re: [T2] Trip to yosemite oil temps and a eurovan

&gt;I am sort of tired of the oil temp debate 
&gt;so if that is too hot oh well etc....

At the risk of starting it up again, I visited the Motorsports Hall of Fame in Talladega, AL this past weekend.  Lots of interesting old American iron there.  I noticed that in many of the cars, they had turned the gauges so that the needles would be pointing straight up at &quot;normal&quot; readings.  In every car I looked in, a vertical needle on the oil temp gauge corresponded to 250-280 degrees.  I have pictures of this.  Also, nearly every car had an external cooler for the differential fluid (in case you were thinking that these cars were too old/unsophisticated to have used external oil coolers).  They could have easily done the same for the oil to keep it at whatever temperature they wanted.  Apparently, in NASCAR 250-280 is (or at least was) the norm.

&gt;In general I felt like she ran like a top......!
&gt;	What is more pressing is that my wife, child and I roasted. 

Congrats to those whose families are willing to endure that kind of heat.  Even though my own family is somewhat tolerant, I took the plunge and installed air conditioning a few years ago so we could travel in (relative) comfort.

&gt; Any thoughts on
&gt;cooling the inhabitants (yeah I know drive at night etc...).

The absolute best thing I ever did prior to the A/C was to keep a set of small spray bottles in the camper - one per person.  A squirt on each ear and some wind in your face and you will feel like you just dove into freezing water (well, almost).  They are great for cleaning up too, when you're camping without facilities.
