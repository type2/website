Subject: High Country Bus Festival 9 -2006!  countdown begins

Hey Volks - sorry it's so late getting this update out to the list.

Mark the calendars now for the last weekend in July:  the 29th, 30th, and 
31st!   It's that time of year to climb the mountain up to Boone and gather 
at the Grandfather Mountain Campground.

Couple of new things this year:

- we have a new band.  While we have enjoyed Bessie Mae's Dream for many 
years now - and they will be back someyear, this year we are in for a real 
treat.  For the past 8 years while attending at the Merlefest Music Festival 
I have camped near the same group of guys from Kentucky.  Every night after 
the festival these guys would sit up and pick for hours..........THEY ARE 
INCREDIBLE.  This is some of the most high-energy and tight picking you'll 
ever hear.   So I asked them about playing HCBF and they responded that they 
were not even in a band together.  They all have separate musical things and 
projects but they only get together and pick when camping at these 
festivals.  I have been trying to convince them to come to HCBF for 
years..............and I guess they just said yes to get me to 
shut-up..........but they are coming.   YOU ARE ALL IN FOR A REAL TREAT.   
now seeing as these guys are not officially in a band, I have given them a 
name:  Carl and the Kentucky Badasses............when you hear them 
pick........you will understand.  They plan to play on the pavilion Sat 
Night - and who knows what you'll hear around the campfire later that night!

what else is new this year?
- a water balloon fight (to be held in way upper field where there are no 
buses!)
- have your picture taken with Gurney the Hog!
- Dixie is going to compile a VW Cookbook - how and what do you cook when 
camping.  you will need to submit your recipe before the festival so we can 
have them printed........more details on this soon!

and as always, returning activities:
- Marc Dearing's tech Class -
- Kids Activities with Dixie  (more details soon)
- People's Choice Awards
- Door Prizes
- Raffle for TYPE 2_dot_com and FMBC
- FMBC Breakfast on sat
- caraBUS along the Blue Ridge Parkway

Rob is going to have the site updated soon with the new schedule..........

There is more to be added soon, am working on last details of some other 
events and activities.

please email me off list if you have any questions:  buddahvw_at_hotmail_dot_com

thanks and I cant wait for that last weekend of July to arrive!
