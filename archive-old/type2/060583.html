I have purchased two Type1 autostick starters from Al's (Al's Auto Supply
and Grant) for $48 recently.

TIP: if you have type1 engine, I hope you purchased one of these, you don't
have to use a bushing.  They were sold for the auto-stick bug but work
awesome with any 12v 200mm flywheel.

Anyway -- Both of the ones I purchased were clearly marked as rebuilt by
Exide, the battery company.  Niether one had any unusual cuts or brinds as
you describe.

I have starter pictures up at http://www.i405_dot_com/vw/stand/
