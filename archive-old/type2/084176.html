Subject: Re curtains &amp; who set up my G-cities web site?

My curtains are tri-layered, using my Hunter green on the outside, and
white with green flower pattern facing inside.  I included a sliding
curtain behind the front seats for quick naps/potty use without messing
with the front curtain.  In the Middle was the cheapest dense linen I
could find.  Guarteed not to let in glaring rest area lights.  My next
curtains I'd like to se mylar metal &quot;space blanket&quot; material in the
center to reflect heat.  Your measurements will be influenced by the
width of your purchase- some are 54&quot;, some are 42&quot;, and you gotta figure
your windows and allow for gathers (if desired) and hems.  You can see
my nifty curtains and zillion other mods at
the goeocities site a listee set up for me (are you out there? I need
the password!)  The site got shut down for overuse the last time I
mentioned it, so like go there on an even day if you have even letters
in your last name, or whatever.......
