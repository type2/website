Subject: RE: [T2] It just died

&gt;From: &quot;Oliver Klothesoff&quot; I was humming along at 70, as usual, and the bus 
&gt;just died. No noises. Nuffin'! Just two red idiot lights on the dash. I had 
&gt;it flatbedded home. So far, I've changed the fuel filter and fuel pump. 
&gt;Where do I go next? Double relay? Pressure regualtor? Any adivice would be 
&gt;most welcome. This process of elimination crapola is getting expensive. 
&gt;Thanx.


Start with the normal stuff.

Does it turn over?
Check all hoses, vacuum lines, alt. belt, look for leaks, etc.
Check points, condensor, spark.
Check compression and fuel.

Then get back to us, with results and more info on year and engine.

Good Luck,
