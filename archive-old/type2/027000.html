I found a tire size converter here:
http://www.s-series_dot_org/htm/calc/tiresizeconv.htm
This tool tells me that a 205/70R14 and a 205/65R15 are just about the same 
overall dimensions.  I did some searching and made some phone calls.  No one 
makes a light truck tire in the 205/65R15 and absolutely no load range D in 
that size.

BUT, Continental makes a 205/65VR15 that Big O says is OE for VW type2's.  
It is has a reinforced sidewall.  The sales guy knew why I wanted a D tire 
when I said VW camper, and that was encouraging. I'd love to keep these empi 
wide fives.  $602 for 5 tires, mounted and balanced, stems, etc.  
*Lifetime/legal-tread* warranty in California.

Is anyone familiar with this tire?
