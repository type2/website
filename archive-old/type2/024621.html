Subject: Germany trip report

Well the short form at least regarding Wolfsburg. I had been warned and 
it comes to bear that the new Autostadt (sp?) display is pretty lame, and 
it is. Now I don't speak a word of German but from looking at people and 
body language it seems to me that it is pretty lame to all. Problem is the 
following you got to do it to see a number of cars that used to be in the 
museum (the car display in the first building on the left is the only one 
worth looking at, well the commercial truck display is OK too.) But hey it's 
only $12 so don't fret too much, just don't blow that much time anywhere 
else there. You also have to do it to take the plant tour (you ride in a
little 
train thing) which is pretty cool, takes an hour, available in English, all
in all 
worth the $12 I guess.

Now the real museum, here is where it gets good, the transporter highlights 
IMHO, the 1st handbuilt prototype. A number of fire trucks of various years. 
The only surviving '78 syncro westy prototype, which I took scores of
pictures 
of how they did (oh some day folks, I've got a lot of the parts already.)
This 
bus was the highlight for me as it is what I went to look at. Oddly it is NOT 
the yellow bus that was pictured on Derek's old syncro website. It is a beige 
'78, and is really beat to a pulp and badly rusted, somebody (program
manager?) 
must have enjoyed the heck out of this thing. It rolls on 7x16 truck tires
that 
fit under the stock bodywork with a bit of a lift. Uses U-joints and
splined slider 
axle shafts not CV's. A regular 091 nose shifted tranny modified for power 
takeoff. A one off front diff for all I can tell, probably housing a stock
T2 R&amp;P 
by the size of it. The steering was able to remain which suprised me but 
I couldn't tell/see how cause a massive skidplate under the front. T4
engined, 
could not tell what type or induction (decklid locked, but hey I opened up
the 
one on a GAS TURBINE bay for a pic) drum brakes all round. The rear axle 
was deeply U'd in the center to accomadate the power take off. A '67 bay 
with splitty front end etc, probably about the oldest bay existant? Lots of
neat 
vanagons, a leather interior lengthened luxury '98 south american bus still 
pushed by a 1600 amazingly enough. Other commercial VW's. And of course 
tons of bugs, polo's, passats (the 1st), scirrocos, jetta (the first), and
a bunch 
of neat prototypes (the T3 ghia prototype uglier than even the production 
version if that is possible.) A 4wd '46 sedan, a kubel and a schwim, but the 
example in the Deutche Museum in Munich was better ( a GREAT museum, 
the German &quot;Smithsonian&quot; with great car, aircraft, machinery, sections, the 
highlight of the trip actually. Neat stainless steel 911, 959 pan and
drivetrain, 
MBZ SS from the day, 300 SLK, auto union racers, and a whole bunch of 
cool cars.)

Anyway I'd plan at least 2 hours in the real museum, and maybe an 2 in the 
car and commercial portions of the Autostadt if I needed to do it again,
with an 
hour for the factory tour as well. Someone interested in bugs might take a
lot 
longer, I looked at them quickly. One last highlight of the Autostadt was
the fact 
that incredible rubber floormats for the EV were only $36 the set, with nice 
prices on mats for all cars, and mudflaps as well. Unfortunately no Vanagon 
mats. Wolfsburg is in the middle of absolutely nowhere as well, there is
nothing 
in the middle north worth seeing on a short trip and you are still too far
away 
from the maritime museums up at the port cities. But it is well enough
situated 
between the Rhein valley and Berlin. I was based out of Frankfurt and did
it on 
a day trip leaving early and getting back late, would have been better to
have 
gone up, stayed somewhere, and just continued on the way to Berlin, wouldn't 
be out of the way then.

All in all pretty cool to see the 4 smokestacks of the old powerplant for
yourself. 
Somewhat awe inspiring in a corney VW sort of way.

FWIW on the rest of the trip saw no more than 10 bays, 10 bugs, few Vanagons 
even oddly enough as well. I take it the TUV gets stuff more than about 12
years 
old off the roads. As a rule across the board Germans were not driving
anything 
older than late 80's. Apparently if you want something cheap you buy a VW
Lupo 
or Opel Corsa or whatever, but you buy it new.
