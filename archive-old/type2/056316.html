Subject: Horn envy

Hello;  The year is 1980, the family is on a Disneyland vacation in out 69
van.  We took the picture with the van in the middle of the redwood tree.
I was disconcerted to see how little respect I commanded on the freeways of
CA.  The cutesy VW &quot;meep&quot; just wasn't moving them. After 3 days of the
magic kingdom, I welcomed a day at the campsite installing the air horns I
picked up at a little strip mall APS.  I wanted to keep the stock horn so I
mounted a 3-position toggle spring-loaded to the off (centre) position. 
Toggle it one way, Meep, toggle it the other way BLAST, I can live with
that.
Zoom forward to approaching the Horseshoe Bay ferry terminal, a 3 mile down
hill quite steep.  As I'm rolling towards the toll booth, a high-vis vested
directs me towards him, I comply, as I approach him, expecting to be
directed to the least busy toll booth, I was 1 foot when he directed me to
swing to the right.  As I wheel across, my cuff catches the toggle switch
and blasts this fellow out of his skin.  I swear he jumped almost 3 feet in
the air.
I ducked and blushed, and woke all of the kids up, paid the ferry fare  and
got in line.  We walked the kids over to the coffee shop, when we got back
I noticed that the air hoses to the horns were cut.
In one way, I don't blame the guy, after all, I had red-lined his ticker. 
If all it took to make things right was a foot of air hose, fine, I can
afford that.
I guess I'll always remember the embarrassment I felt for this faux pas.
For this reason, I'll stick with the stock VW horn.
