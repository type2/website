&gt; First, thanks for the responses.
&gt; 
&gt; After todays adventures, I am left knowing two
&gt; things. 1 Kragen does not have the ability to
&gt; properly test the unit it sold me. and 2 I don't
&gt; think the Starter/Solenoid is the issue. 
&gt; 
&gt; I'll skip the frustrating part of my day and get to
&gt; the point.  With a new rebuilt replacement
&gt; Starter/Solenoid (whichs theoretically works
&gt; properly) Sunshine still won't start.  Ok.  So it
&gt; has to be something else.  Back to the computer to
&gt; check for responses from you guys.
&gt; 
&gt; Two things stand out.  1 Go back to the start.  The
&gt; issue began with the engine stopping.  2 Is the
&gt; engine spinning freely?
&gt; 
&gt; So I go back out.  I double check the stick shift,
&gt; run it through the gears and back to neutral.  I
&gt; grab a wrench, put it on the Alternator Pulley and
&gt; try to hand turn the engine.  The Alternator pulley
&gt; slips under the fan belt (I suppose I could tighten
&gt; that up but not the point) otherwise nothing moves. 
&gt; I go the other direction and everything turns
&gt; normally, fan belt does not slip, but I can't go
&gt; very far before it tightens up.Back in the original
&gt; direction, free at first then tight where it was
&gt; before I started.  So The ENGINE IS NOT SPINNING
&gt; FREELY. 
I'm not satisfied that you've proven the engine does
not turn over. You can try pushing the bus in 4th
gear, you can raise one wheel and try turning it while
in 4th gear, you can remove all 4 spark plugs (to
eliminate compression) and try turning with the
fanbelt or the two methods I mentioned BEFORE you
assume the worst.
When the engine died, did the bus screech to a stop,
wheels locked up? Did it try to keep running for a
bit?

HOW ABOUT - did you recover all the pieces of the
broken bracket, bolt, etcetera or might something be
jammed under the crankshaft pulley?

Try turning the crankshaft from the nut on the end.

Hmmm... Replaced starter? Maybe wrong starter and not
engaging to flywheel ring gear properly? -BaH
