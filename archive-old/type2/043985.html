Subject: Re: [T2] Cooling a '70 Westfalia

my 69-westy has a 1600dp doghouse 34 pick carb vacumm dist.and a/c around 
town my temp is about 180 on highyway it runs about 220+-(via berg stick&amp;vdo 
gauge)      at about 3800-4000rpm tall tires 215-75-14,the doghouse will be 
good but the other items youre going to do will make a big difference we have 
some busses here set up that same way but with an electric fan and thermostat 
on the cooler and they dont go above 180-190 if possible set comp at 7.5-6.6 
all my best from FLORIDA.
