Be sure to check the ground wires!

&gt;Melissa,

&gt;The best way to check this would be to turn on the parking lights, and
&gt;see which wires have current. The wires that are for the side marker and
&gt;rear parling light should be hot while the other should not be. I tried
&gt;to check on my '71 bus, but the taillight wiring has been modified so
&gt;much it is hard to tell anymore (oh well, one more thing to fix). I hope
&gt;this helps you some.

&gt;
&gt;P.s. the side markers on this bus wernt hooked up when I got it either.

&gt;
&gt;List,
&gt;
&gt;i am still battling with the lights issue I have had on my 71 westy. I
&gt;have
&gt;front turns, headlights, parking lights all around. No rear brake lights
&gt;or
&gt;turn signals. The rear side markers aren't hooked up at all.
&gt;This is what I have. In the rear left light i have two brown ground
&gt;wires
&gt;going to the respective ground spot on the light housing. One of these
&gt;is a
&gt;stand alone wire, one is wrapped with another wire, appears to be green
&gt;or
&gt;grey with black stripe. This wire (green/grey) has current and is going
&gt;to
&gt;the left prong on the housing. it joins a stand alone wire yellow with
&gt;black
&gt;dots. Then alone on the right prong is the Black with yellow stripe
&gt;wire. I
&gt;am getting current to all those correctly except the brown ground wires
&gt;(as
&gt;it should). I reviewed the wiring diagram so graciously sent me, but the
&gt;
&gt;colors dont appear clear the diagram. It looks as though one ground and
&gt;one
&gt;of my positive current wires now running to my rear taillight should be
&gt;running to the side markers. Any idea which ones.
&gt;I am at a bit of a disadvantage as i dont have anyone to press the
&gt;brakes for
&gt;me as I check the currents.
&gt;Any help is appreciated!
&gt;Thanks all!
&gt;Melissa
