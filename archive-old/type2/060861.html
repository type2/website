Subject: That blasted exhaust manifold stud

So-

Before you all get too excited, I haven't done anything yet.  Tomorrow
is my day off but will probably be filled with hauling stuff from our
tiny house to either the storage place or the dump.  It has been way too
long and way to crowded.  Once we finish our new house...  Yeah, yeah,
room for all the kids and the books and the beautiful piano I can
finally buy, and the random whatever that seems to flow into our
lives...

But what about the garage?

Two car garage with a level cement slab floor!!!  Level is a grand
thing.  Not gravel is a blessing!  All my work is done on rolly polly
gravel and what ever light conditions seep from around the clouds and
raindrops here in western Washington.

My oh my.  A garage.  What a happy boy I will be.  Maybe even a bench
for my tools...
Mmm...  Enough of that.

Back to my point.  From all the responses I received (a hearty thank you
to all of those who wrote me) the best choice would be a step stud.
Then, if that didn't work on it's own, drill, retap then throw in a step
stud.  That ought to do it.  The biggest trick would be to drill the
hole straight.  Goggles over the eyes and keep your mouth closed.
Important stuff.

It should be any week now that my chaos abates enough to do this.
Hopefully it will coincide with a sunny day.

Am I asking for too much?
