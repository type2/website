Subject: Re: [T2] pulling a trailer

Got a 5x8 feet utlity trailer with a 2x6&quot; wood floor. I have no idea how heavy it is but I have pulled it all over with our bus carrying up to 5 Corvair and VW engines. Does fine but watch the engine temps on a hot day. Also with heavy loads watch your brakes, they are okay but not ideally suited for heavy loads and hills. My bus really runs out of steam on the mountain roads. Lots of 2nd gear climbs with the trailer hitched up out back.

Have also pulled Beetles and BIG trailers (empty). I always drive gently to make life a bit easier on the tranny. By the way all this was with the stock tranny and 2.0 engine. Have no idea how good or bad my bus will do with the Corvair implant as I still haven't driven it.
