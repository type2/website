Subject: head

Hello, all...
I was wondering if anyone new of a place where I can
check the numbers on my head to see the size of my
engine. I am pretty darn sure it is 1800, but would
like to make absolutely sure. Also, does anyone have a
used 1800 head they can sell me? 
                                   Thanks,
                                   Paul Deatherage
