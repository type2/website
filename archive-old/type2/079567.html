Hello Suzanna And Listees    What has happened to your case is that you have 
cracked the case where the bolt that holds the pickup tube in place. It is 
inbetween the push tubes and has a 13mm head on it with a copper sealing 
washer. You might be able to insert a little longer bolt, otherwise you have 
to  tear the engine down. I have fixed these with thread repair kits before.  
Mark Dearing Salem Import service Salem Va.   PS   this is a real weak spot 
on type 4 motors so when cleaning the screen be real carefull tighting the 
center bolt.
