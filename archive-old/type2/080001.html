Subject: Re: [T2] Wiring a spare (camping) battery in to a 78 bus

Well I am an idiot too. My Hella kit is in a box in my bus. I didn't
understand it either. It seemed weird to connect heavy battery gauge wire to
that small 16 or 18 gauge wire from the kit. I too need help!

Subject: [T2] Wiring a spare (camping) battery in to a 78 bus


&gt; O.K., I tried posting a similar question to the
&gt; Vanagon site some time ago when I had a Vanagon and
&gt; got majorly flamed as a moron etc. This list seems to
&gt; be a little more tolerant so I will try it here now
&gt; that I own a '78. I saw a similar post a couple weeks
&gt; back but no one  (that I can tell) answered the
&gt; question so here goes.
&gt;
&gt; I bought the Hella second battery kit from Ron (about
&gt; $20) but the directions are vague enough as to leave
&gt; me clueless on how to successfully wire a second
&gt; battery (Deep Cycle)into the bus for use while camping
&gt; (so not to kill the primary battery). I have read many
&gt; comments on these including this one,
&gt;
http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/200104230337.UAA20751_at_lenti.type2_dot_com.htm
l
&gt; ,from Ron on the plus &amp; minus of them but can't find a
&gt; thread on how (exactly) to hook it up. So. if anyone
&gt; out there would be kind enough to send me some
&gt; instructions, that would be really great. I am fairly
&gt; competent mechanically and can figure most of this
&gt; stuff out but reading the instructions that came with
&gt; the Hella - I am just to clear on how to hook it up,
&gt; gauge of wire, etc.  Please hold the flames, I am
&gt; already well done :-)
