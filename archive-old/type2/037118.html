Subject: Clutch problem/question 71 SC 1600 DP 

When I reinstalled my engine into my 71 SC awhile back, I noticed I had to
use the bolt/nuts to pull the engine towards the case. This concerned me,
but I thought since everything was new and stiff, it might be kinda normal.
The clutch package is one I found with the 71 SC and parts that I had gotten
off of Richard Kurtz (he passed away a couple months ago I hear). I assumed
they were for this engine since he seemed to have mostly 71 stuff around his
place.

When I turned the engine over the first time, it squealed like a stuck pig
until you pushed the clutch down. I tried doing some adjusting, but it didnt
seem to help. I did notice that when the clutch peddle was pushed down, the
noise went away. I then put a 2X4 on the peddle and held it down while I
worked on getting the engine running. Once that was done, I released the
clutch but the noise was there and the SC did not move.

I pulled the engine today and found the end of the guide sleeve(covers the
input shaft) was chewed up and busted a little. THe Brasilian TO bearing
feels a little odd when turning it by hand(maybe just me) and the ring that
was on the little fingers on the pressure plate was dangling on the input
shaft when I pulled the engine out.

I dont have a number for the pressure plate, but the clutch disc is
311 141 031 DBR

The TO bearing has Brasil  R-1010 AC

I assume I have the wrong clutch package and if not, what caused the damage,
noise and having to pull the engine towards the tranny?
