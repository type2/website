Cassandra and all:
    Unless you are planning on donating this product to the hopefully soon
to be opening &quot;Museum of Crock-O-Sh*t As Seen On TV Products,&quot; I wouldn't
waste my money. If my memory serves me well this is the stuff that is
featured in the ad with the group of slack-jawed dimwits marvelling as Bob
Eubanks and some actor protraying an engineer pour sand and gravel into the
crank case of a running engine. Somehow this stuff is so slippery that it
can neutralize all manner of crud and even after the oil had been drained
and the coolant hoses cut, it still ran perfectly.
    The reality is, it won't fix a screwed up engine and it won't protect a
decent engine any better than oil and proper maintenence. I feel very
confident in saying that this stuff is a scam because when I bought my bus,
the P.O. had a bottle of &quot;Motor Up&quot; that he threw in as part of the deal.
The engine ran crappy due to a half-a**ed hot rod job so I poured the bottle
in as insurance until I could inspect the engine and convert it back to
stock. When the oil light came on during L.A. freeway traffic and the
courteous drivers would not let me get to the shoulder, I didn't panic
because hey, at least there are no rocks in my crank case. When I finally
got to the shoulder the Motor Up was rapidily exiting through a fist sized
hole in the crank case.  According to the commercial, I should have been
able to make it to Phoenix and back in that condition.
    My 2 cents, buy good quality oil, change it regularly and save your $ to
get something pretty for your bus like a glitter dash board ;o).

Respectfully,
Jeff Mitchell 69 Westy &quot;Weezy&quot;

&gt;
&gt; Hi,
&gt; Was wondering if anyone has heard of a product called Motor Up? It's an
oil
&gt; additive that's supposed to increase performance and decrease wear and
&gt; tear... It also apparently (I did say, apparently....) removes all the
built
&gt; up dirt, grease and gremlins..... Do you think it's a crock, or worth a
go?
&gt; Oh, and I did my first carb replacement job, got my Kev running for the
&gt; first time in almost 6 months and he goes like a dream!!!! (except the
pesky
&gt; oil cooler thing, but that's a job for May)
&gt;
&gt; Cassandra.
&gt; '69 Kombi -- Kev.. recently reunited with the road, now complete with
purple
&gt; tye dyed curtains and pink n purple paisley carpet, purpleand yellow
&gt; interior and glitter dash... Soon to be painted..
