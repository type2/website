If it truly is there, a pickup can definitely be arranged.  I could bring it
to EB along the way for show and tell, then get it started to the left
coast.

Peace, Troy

&gt; Hi Mark,
&gt; 
&gt; Word came back from the Buskatiers that it was last seen in Columbia,
&gt; MO. We're still waiting to hear back from the guy who had it.
&gt; 
&gt; If there are any list-members near there, possibly headed to
&gt; Everybus, perhaps we could send it home with Troy and get it out to
&gt; the west-coast for a while.
