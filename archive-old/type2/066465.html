&gt; I have (had) an awesome fluke meter.  The dam thing did everything and it

&gt; but it has all the buttons along the top and side.(about $500 I think)
&gt; Those things are really rugged but it just couldn't stand up to being run
&gt; over by my bus. don't ask. Everything still seems functional accept the
&gt; screen is wrecked.  anyone got a lead on how to fix em or where to get
&gt; parts? 
&gt; thanks.
