Subject: POR 15 Tank Rebuild
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

I found what I needed in a last minute discovered self inflicted emergency,
and am in good shape as to my getting the tank cleaned so we can get off on 
2001, A Bus Odyssey next week.

I don't know if this message will get type 2 list posted, or not.
Seems to be some HTML or Judge issue out there... in there... wherever.

Thanks for bailing me out and cross posting on my behalf so others will 
know I am OK on getting the tank kit.
