Subject: Warm Air Vs. Cold Air for Carbs

The thread on warm air for the type IV carbs has triggered these
questions.

Why preheat the carb air?  Does it make a difference in a FI system?

I realize that colder air is denser than hot air (except for the hot air
from politicians) and I'm figuring that there is more energy potential
available in cold air.  I also have noticed that in a few racing
equipment catalogs, that there are devices to cool the air.

Would anybody care to explain the physics/mechanics behind all this?

Thanks!!
