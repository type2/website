Subject: cyl head removal 75 bus

--part1_17e.d883f66.2a9eb078_boundary

Sorry for the blank email just now hit the wrong button.  I think something 
in the valvetrain on my wifes bus broke appears to be running on 3 cyls and 
did the plugwire removal trick and yep # 3 is deas verified by putting a 
different wire on it.  So I know I need to remove the valvecover and take a 
look see put can I pull the head with the engine in the bus or is it engine 
removal time
Thanks
