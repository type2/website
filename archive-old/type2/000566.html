My '71 Westy bus, which I bought unseen in Va. with a blown engine, is ready
to be put back together again after being in the body\paint shop (a backyard
type- but good)since March, 1999. Mark Dearing of Salem Imports in Salem Va.
rebuilt the engine and it runs like a champ. The trip from Salem, Va. was
relatively uneventful and the bus ran great. When it got to Cincy, it got
the mechanicals fixed (brakes etc.)and then went to the body\ paint shop of
Tom S.(who has another full time job) who is a great body and paint man but
he does it at his own pace. He painted my oval, show quality ,in 1 1/2 years
(lots and lots of hand sanding). Any way, he started cutting out what little
rust there was and replacing with metal. As most of you know, there is
always more there than you thought.We agreed that this was not to be show
quality (so it would be done quicker).  I saw my bus with the paint finished
last night and it looks GREAT.

The one great thing about Tom S. is that I can work in his garage and use
his tools while he is working on my bus. Generally he is not there so I have
plenty of room. During this time, I totally striped the interior and top
canvas, installed different gauges, corrected wiring problems (some still
remain),new turn signal lever, new sliding windows ,rebuilt my doors
(including Locks- thanks for your article Ron)and one key now fits all
locks.

During this time I have had the interior reupholstered, wheels and bumpers
powdercoated,  and new tires mounted on the wheels. I have made my own
carpet set and covered my stained side paneling with a tweed
material(including kick-panels)

If you are still reading at this point, thank you. I have taken the next 5
days off work to put it all together and make it my daily driver. Here are
my plans. I will have the bus put back together, sound proofing installed ,
interior insulated, undercoated (inside and out),everything wired and
working, a heating system installed (with blower). While this may sound like
a Herculean task, it isn't. Everything is assembled as much as possible and
ready to put back in. I'll let you know how it goes...............

Don't take life too seriously- you'll never live through it.
