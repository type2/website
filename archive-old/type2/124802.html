Subject: Fw: [T2] Saggy front suspension

 Thanks Joel,
 No not lowered. Andy used to sit high until the original springs succumbed
 to sag. I replaced them with the springs from a parts bus I have and again
 he has sagged very quickly as the springs were already used.
 Just wondering if I need to source new springs or look into other options.
 I suppose part of the problem is Andy often carries a lot of weight
speeding
 up the sagging process.
 Cheers,
 Richard

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;As soon as
&gt; &gt; I put any weight in him he sits on the bump stops which is not good!!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; No other thoughts???&lt;&lt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; could this bus have been possibly lowered by a PO?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; maybe one of the torsion leaves has been removed or is broken.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; HTH,
&gt; &gt;
