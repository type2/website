Subject: 89 Westy. Guesstimate for how much?

I own an 81 Transporter, and would like to move up to a westfalia. The
choices locally are slim, so I check out anything I find.

Today I came across an 89 Westy, very clean, showed 88K on the odometer. I
didn't talk to the owner because I probably cannot afford it. I checked a
few books for a ballpark price, and came up with about $16K which sound
silly to me for an 11 year old camper.

The body and paint is fine, the interior looked pretty nice. 4 Speed, and
the pop top was in pretty okay shape, tires all need to be replaced. 
Overall, a cursory look show it to be about a 7 out of 10. (whatever that
means &lt;g&gt;)

Is that $16K number out of line? I know there are a millions variables,
but any westy lovers care to comment on the price before I call the owner
and bother him for what I may not be able to afford?

Much obliged for any comments or opinions.

Regards from Utah,

John
