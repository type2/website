Subject: NOS split wheel cylinders for sale

Folks,

I have a bunch of NOS German wheel cylinders for 55 - 63 splitties. I
figured I'd give listmembers the first stab before listing them on the
auction site that is to remain nameless on the list. I have a complete front
axle set (ATE 3 2725 1001 3; 3 2725 1101 3; 3 2725 1002; 2725 1102 3) and
three individual front upper left ones (ATE 3 2725 1002 3). Judging by Ron's
catalog these should work as lower left ones as well.

Usually, these go for $45 each. I offer them to listmembers for $30 each or
$110 for the complete front axle kit. Actually, I would prefer trades for
T2b parts over cash. My girlfriend's bus is in dire need of good 185R14C
tires and plenty other parts. Make me an offer!

Currently, I am in Germany but I will be back in the U.S. in late September
and can bring the wheel cylinders in my luggage to cut down on shipping
cost. Please respond asap - otherwise they will be up for auction starting
Tuesday.

Marcus
