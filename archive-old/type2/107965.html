Subject: Re: [T2] valve trouble

Yes, you should be able to see the valve when looking down the spark plug
hole.  Does sound like a recessed valve.  I guess if I had to drive it
anyway I'd screw the adjusting screw down until it just touched the stem and
then only a 1/4 turn more, just enough so the stem isn't hitting the end of
the rocker arm.

&gt; Tried to adjust
&gt; valves today and the intake valve in #2 would not loosen up. turned the
&gt; adjusting screw out until it turned freely. Still could not feel any gap
&gt; between valve stem and rocker.:-( Looked down the spark plug hole and I
&gt; could not see the head of the valve. It's as if it is recessed into the
&gt; head. If I remember right; on my 75 the valve head protrudes slightly
&gt; into the combustion chamber when it is resting on the seat. Im I
&gt; remembering correctly?
&gt;
&gt; I have turned the adjuster till I feel it touch the valve stem. Then
&gt; turned it 2 turns tighter. Shined flashlight to see if I have gap
&gt; between rocker and valve spring retainer, I do. Do I dare start this
&gt; engine again before replacing or repairing the head?
