&gt; Seems they aren't too pleased with my comments about said shows and
&gt; whatnot, and I have been informed that I AM NOT ALLOWED TO ATTEND!  You
&gt; read that right, I've been informed that I will be turned away at the gate.
&gt;  Same goes for the Classic - I've been banned from the Classic!

Sounds like someone we don't have to deal with!  Perhaps the bus folk
