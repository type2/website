Subject: RE: Engine reseal question

BTW, the motor is a T2 1971 1600.  Sorry...


Hello all,

I just finished resealing my motor (took apart everything except did not
split the case).  I have one tiny question regarding the rear main seal.  In
my seal kit was a 0-ring that was about two inches across.  A friend told me
that it fits by the rear main seal but I could find no place for it.  I went
through my manuals and found no diagrams that showed a o-ring there.  Does
anyone know where this might go?  My motor is COMPLETLY ready to be
installed but I am hesitating because of the o-ring.  ANY comments or advice
would be appreciated.

Justin
