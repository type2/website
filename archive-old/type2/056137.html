Subject: re: bus gods

hello again,

the bus gods got me. after all the fun i had, went to take an evening
drive to enjoy the new dash lights and clock. turn key nothing. found
broken connecter on fuse panel. feeling cocky again fire it up.
disengage emergency brake....looks like the fourth of july under the
dash, bus shuts off. not a good sign. put e-brake on fires up everything
is fine, can see the wire thats the culprit may be from wipers. will
find out in am. by now i am late to pickup kid so i hop in m*tro feeling
smiten by the bus gods. tomorrow i'll sacrafice a few quarts of castrol
and ask for there forgiveness. 
by the way jessica is a 69 westy saved last year from a certain death of
lonlyness and abandonment.
