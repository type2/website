&gt; My bus, which is a '73 highroof with full camper interior, fridge, stove,
&gt; THREE batteries, floor jack and a 60lb toolbox, spare parts and my 180lb
&gt; butt in it weighed only 4100 lbs.  I weighed it several times so I am
&gt; fairly certain my numbers are accurate.

There is no argument on this matter.

I posted this to the list back in June during my tire searching days.  It
verifies the numbers posted in the back of the owners manual:

&gt; The bus weighed in at 3500 lbs (w/two spare tires and me on board).
&gt; 
&gt; Front axle was 1640 lbs.
&gt; Rear axle was 1860 lbs.

My bus has a simple icebox and was clean at the time of weighing with
nothing stored in it that didn't come with the vehicle.
