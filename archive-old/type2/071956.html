&gt;I believe David's point here is not so much the CR, but the volumetric
&gt;balance, which is more important to get right than matching CR.

Yes, that's exactly my point.

&gt;if you are paying over the odds for the MSHP heads and you've spent $$
&gt;balancing your rods to 1g or whatever, you should expect to get matching
&gt;combustion chambers.

Yes, although MSHP's basic rebuilds don't cost significantly more than
anyone elses.

&gt;If you want a longer lasting, more reliable engine
&gt;that gives you more power AND better fuel consumption, I say go for it,
&gt;it's worth the extra effort.  As with most things in life these days
&gt;though, if you want a job done properly, you have to do it yourself...

Yup.  Too bad all of us don't have mills, lathes, and other special
equipment that are needed for such things.  :(
