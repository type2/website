Subject: Re: [Fwd: [T2] Rattle,humm,grumble,growl]

just pull off the cap that holds the stickshift down, put a good amount
of grease in the ball joint and put it back together.  Be sure to get
the plate aligned correctly so you're stickshift has the correct throw
(look in the bentley, it's really easy).

It's smooth like butter on mine after I did this :)

...and yes, that rattle is extremely annoying!

later,
Mike

&gt; &gt; Hi All,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; These are the noises &quot;Rattle,humm,grumble,growl&quot; that
&gt; &gt; my shift linkage makes at various RPM ranges.  I was
&gt; &gt; wondering if any VW sages had such advice on repairing
&gt; &gt; this most annoying/maddening racket.  Of all the
&gt; &gt; issues this bus has, this one is the only one I can't
&gt; &gt; live with much longer :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Oyez!  Me too!  I thought the rattling was coming from the dash, but a
&gt; keener eared passenger traced it to the stickshift, and sure 'nuff, if I
&gt; gently hold it in place, the noise is significantly lessened.
&gt; 
&gt; Something loose?
&gt; 
&gt; Teri
