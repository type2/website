I'm toying with the idea of selling my Bus.  I was wondering if anyone could
give me an idea of its value.

It is a 76 Transporter, 2.0 with a big two barrel carb.  Yes it used to be
F.I.  The body has little/no rust, but the left side has a shallow dent in
it.  It is tan/brown/primer spotted, brown interior.  Pretty new tires.
Needs a clutch cable, which I have, but the cold weather snuck up on me.
Has loads of &quot;quirks&quot; that could be fixed, or lived with.  Runs pretty good.
Probably needs a battery.  Oh it has a small dent on the roof right up
front, from where I was standing on the roof.  I suggest no one stand on
their roof.

Having owned a Bus years ago, and missing it every day since I sold it, I
hate to be busless again, but the fact of the matter is, something has to
give, and the Bus is just sitting and that's not good for it.  I have a hard
time putting monetary value on my cars (they tend to be compensation issues,
I'm told) so could someone help me out?  Thanks.

Mike
76 Bus
