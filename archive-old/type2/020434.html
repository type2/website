Subject: my fuel pump is all wiggly


Ok, that's not actually true.  But I'd like to know why the mount for 
the pump is on rubber bushings like it's some kind of compression bomb 
or something.  In the process of pulling my engine (i pulled my engine) 
I ripped one of the bushings right off.  It doesn't bother me much, but 
I would like to know what will happen in the summer when I zip tie the 
pump to the frame.  Is there any reason I should attempt to find a new 
rubber mounting dohicky, or was that just the germans being their normal 
silly selves? 

   This is on my 77 2.0 westy. 

   Right.  That's all really.  Here's a tip.  When lifting your engine, 
go with the knees.  It's much less painful that way.  I should know 
better.  But whatever.

   Have a nice day there boys and girls.
