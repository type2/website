&gt; There appears to be a hole
&gt; for a gas guage on the left, and I've found a reference to it on
&gt; a list of changes by year, but no catalogues seem to list it for

Yes, for a '64, the hole to the left of the speedo is for a gas
gauge.  In your case, a 6-volt (unless your system has been
upgraded to 12-volt).  Most aftermarket bus suppliers won't have
the original gauge, but it is a VDO unit and several vendors sell
VDO gauges.
