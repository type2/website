DOH!

I was looking at my front beam disassembled - tierods were out of the way. 
With the tierods in place, the tube *has* to go over the front beam - or at
least would cause trouble if it went through the middle.

..no wonder noone responded on this... maybe it was too stoopid to be in the
archives... :-P

So, the over-the-beam tube stays - its in really good shape anyway.

I was thinking about my whole heating system on my 45 minute drive home from
work...

My bus is a 74 kombi - 7-seater maybe?  Had the flap vent in the middle of the
floor for the back seat folks, you know.

I put a hybrid 75/78 camper interior in it - 78 3/4 length z-bed(folding
seat), 78 closet over spare tire hole, 78 fridge to the left of the z-bed and
75 westy sink cabinet behind the driver with the cabinets opening towards the
sliding door. Grok? K.

Anyway, the westy flooring covered the flap vent in the middle of the cargo
floor, and there never was an vent for heat under the zbed like there are in
campers, so the only heat source for the back seat folks will be the vent in
the floor between the two front seats.

I am gonna use some kind of booster up front to help pull air for front heat
and defrosting, but if i leave the stock 'control box' in the middle of the
system under the bus and hooked up, the booster up front will pull air in
through the floor vent, so rather than this vent being an outlet for heat, it
will become an inlet for the booster fan - not good for the back seat folks. I
found a way to fix it with help from a post i found in the archives.

I'm going to split up the output of the heat exchangers.  I will remove the
'Y' at the back, and route a direct line from the passenger-side HE (accordian
tube) to the inlet for the vent between the front seats. This vent will then
have the full output of the pass-side HE with half the boost of the engine
compartment boosterfan and half the output of the engine fan - which ought to
be plenty when everything is all sealed up and insulated.

The driver's side HE will then connect straight to the new 3&quot; main heater
tube, which runs all the way up and connects to the over-the-beam tube.  The
center control box will be gone by this time as well.
The booster fan up front will help to pull the air the distance and also
should provide plenty of heat up front when all is sealed - not to mention the
added benefit (fewer moving parts, fewer leaks) of the absence of the center
control box.

I'll be able to shut them off via the flapper boxes in the back.

I'll never be able to get the output of both exchangers to one or both
sources, but i think with both of them blowing full blast, we'll get and stay
warm in a reasonable amount of time.

I think it will work like a charm - especially with the engine compartment
booster fan pulling its input from inside the bus at the back - another mod i
picked up off u guys.

Learning continues, long live this list...
