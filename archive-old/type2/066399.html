Subject: Re: Dipstick style temp. sender question

steve writ:

Has anyone had trouble with oil leaking from the dipstick tube after
installing a VDO dipstick temp. sender?

The new dipstick doesn't have a metal &quot;cup&quot; that covers the end of the
dipstick tube like the stock dipstick does.  Instead, there's a dense
cotton disk that butts up against the end of the tube.

no, no problems

and I recently found an old (marked 5/57) oil tempVDO gauge that has the same
styling as a splitty gas gauge, with dipstick sender.  neato
