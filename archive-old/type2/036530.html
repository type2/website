Subject: shift rod coupling

On my '71 Westy, I have the engine and transmission out and I've just
replaced the three shift rod bushings. I temporarily mounted my rebuilt
transmission and joined it to the shift rod via the flexible coupling.  I
was able to move the gear shift lever through the gears once, before the
trans locked up.  I'm trying to understand what happened.

My focus at the moment is on the flexible coupling.  During this rebuild, I
have replaced the rubber inserts  -  the two square pieces of rubber which
accept the rolled pin.  This entire assembly, as I have  it together at the
moment, is suspect.  The nut on the rolled pin bottoms out before pulling
the two inserts snugly into the housing.  So the result is that the pin,
the inserts, nd the housing all flop around with respect to each other.

My question is:  Is this looseness normal?   If not, could someone have a
go at describing how tight the assembly should be? Should I be able to
easily wiggle all those parts. And I mean easily.

Thanks for the help.

Jack
