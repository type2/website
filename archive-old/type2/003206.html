Skip,

I just put a fiberglass poptop on a '70 Campmobile whose previous top had
been damaged. I found a couple at a junkyard, and chose one to fit my model
year.

I have heard others mention the idea of using a later model top, but it
would seem to me to be a little more challenging. You would have to drill
new holes to fit the new top (assuming you already have the holes for the
earlier top), and in doing so you would need to be precise, as the two
pieces of fiberglass have to fit closely togther to prevent leaks (one of
the fiberglass pieces should have a rubber seal on the side that meets the
other piece). The later model top is supposed to be roomier (sleeping 2
instead of one), but I decided to stick with what was stock for my vehicle,
and I'm glad I did.

For a good diagram, check out: http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/bbwest87.htm ...but I
wouldn't buy from them based on other recent posts to the list.

Good luck.

Dan Melton
