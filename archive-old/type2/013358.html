&gt; &gt;Finding a genuine shot bag in an auction is another great thing but they

&gt; a 12&quot;x12&quot; one around me being sold at an old &gt;body shops equipment auction.
Another possibility for a container for shot/sand are the legs of old
denim jeans. (no not ones with holes in the knees) Just cut ~1.5 ft of
leg and sew up one end/ the fill and sew up the other. Should work for
this as well, I use it for rifle rest.
