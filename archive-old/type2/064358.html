Subject: one step primer

I did use a onestep type primer by derusto ( I think)  It worked great.  I
primed a rusty roof of an old panel truck,but I didn't have enough to cover the
whole roof.  After a couple of years the unprimed area was coming through the
enamel top coat but the one-step primed area was doing fine.  I don't see this
stuff around much, but then I haven't really looked for it.  I use two step
process with a black rust reformer type emulsion followed by primer ....John
