That thing is wrong in so many ways.....
You would think for what the guy spent on the listing fee he would have used
spellcheck!!  2 blatant ones: carberator and Hologen

Lets see: last registered in 2002 and no mention of it being non-oped?

And I love those Goodyear Wingfoots...... nowhere to be found on any Goodyear tire list.
How old ARE they???

But my favorite line is: &quot;All of the instrumentation works flawlessly. The gas gauge is even set so you never
run out of gas and only registers 3/4 when full.&quot;

HA HA HA....... yeah, he set it that way!!

Opening bid is only 4999 but reserve not met at 8100??
