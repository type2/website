&gt; Hey all:
&gt; After reading (with envy) the activities of the CCC folks, I got to
&gt; thinkin': why not get people together from Wisconsin (just happens to be
&gt; where I live surrounding states welcome of course) to do a group camp thing
&gt; sometime next summer? Just think: Door County (or wherever), buses, bus
&gt; people--it just doesn't get any better than that. Any interest? Any
&gt; suggestions for possible camping venues?

I would be interested in this even though I am from Florida. My rebuilt
Westy is plenty broken in by now to handle a drive to the north country.
Please keep me (us) posted as to any details.
