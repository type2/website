Subject: Re: [T2] No idle/hard restart at operating temp - the saga
  continues...

&gt; Several replies were quick to warn of a cracked head
&gt; or similar
&gt; problem, but the bus is *not* losing power, even
&gt; after the symptoms
&gt; begin. As long as the RPMs are up, it runs great.
&gt; But as soon as I
&gt; need to slow down for a stop sign etc., it dies and
&gt; doesn't want to
&gt; restart.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I elected to start with the fuel filter and
&gt; a new temp sensor.
&gt; I got the parts today and prepared to dive in... and
&gt; lo and behold the
&gt; existing sensor is unplugged! Question is, I don't
&gt; know if it vibrated
&gt; loose or was intentionally disconnected at some
&gt; point. Forgive my
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Also, the existing sensor nut appears to be
&gt; something huge, like 25mm,
&gt; and the replacement Bosh part is 13mm. Do I have the
&gt; wrong
&gt; replacement, or could this still be the right part?
&gt;
Sounds like you got an oxygen sensor maybe... Not a
headtemp sensor. Now you ARE meaning the sensor just
ahead of #3 spark plug, right? (See my third photo
album - link in my signature) If that is unplugged,
the engine should not be able to run. It should be
blubbering and belching black smoke at best. It
doesn't fit the symptoms you described. BTW - as I
told you way back when, if it is a crack, the engine
will run fine and behave normally at higher rpm but
not at lower rpm when warmed up and the hotter it
gets, the worse it gets. I hope that isn't it, too,
but your symptoms read like a book...

I cannot find the headtemp sensor in my Bentley and I
don't have a bus engine in my bus anymore, so I can't
walk outside and look to tell you where it plugs in. I
can tell you however that I have in the past plugged
mine in in darkness without a light just by feeling
around for the only available matching connector in
the area! If your wiring is stock there is only one
wire to connect to that is within reach of the stock
sensor wire.

I cannot come up with a scenario where a stock fuel
injected 2L should be able to run witout that
connected UNLESS somebody has modified the circuit and
added a resistor or series of resistors to get up in
the 2000 ohm area. The proper resistance for the
sensor is approximately 2400 ohms at approximately 70
degrees F.
I added a variable resistor to mine so I could add an
additional 2000 ohms from the drivers seat. If there
was a previous owner who did something like that but
wired it wrong, it could work as you describe. If they
wired it correctly and the sensor was unplugged, it
would have infinite resistance and simply would not
run because it would be so rich.

The sensor has more resistance when cold and less as
it heats up. Hope this helps. -BaH
