-Hey, what happened to point gap?  I set mine visually (not even a
feeler gauge) with a bright light and usually get 48 deg dwell!  So one
can manage with not even a feeler gauge!  If I'm right that your timing
mark is when points just close, then with some wire and a bulb, and
noting that the points are just a switch sending/breaking the primary
curcuit, one can connect the bulb within this and  then turn the crank
until light comes on and note where it goes off -will give you dwell-
Muir covers this.
