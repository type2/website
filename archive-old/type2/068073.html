Subject: Re: '54 barndoor around town (hand crank injuries)

I've always heard about possible injuries from hand cranking engines.  My 
grandpa told me when I was but a wee lad, of how he knew lots of people 
who broke fingers, wrists, and arms from a backfiring Model T when he was 
younger.  He showed me how you would crank start by using the &quot;flat part 
of your palm&quot;.  It was those who actually &quot;grabbed&quot; the hand crank that 
ended up getting hurt.  Ah for the luxury of electric starters - when 
they work that is.
