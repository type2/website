Subject: Compression Ratio problems

I have come across several things that concern me.  I am attempting to
size my CR.  I'm getting results I didn't expect.  Like now needing a
.125&quot; and .155&quot; shim.  Mabey I have made a mistake.  There are also
several other factor involved that make me scratch my head.

Instead boring the list with the detail is there someone out there who
has Excel 97 and has done this before that can check my numbers and tell
me if I'm out of wack, or just fine?

Thanks
Brent
