Ok, so what's the story on this stuff?  Does it really do al the stuff they
say it (and its competitors, Slick 50 etc) say? - Protect on cold starts,
improve fuel economy, extend engine life, etc? 

My motorcycle mechanic said to stay away from the stuff become in the bike
the clutch uses the same oil and the gearbox and crankcase ie. _gets
slippery_, but how would it do in an isolated crankcase?

Just wondering!
