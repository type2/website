Subject: RE: [T2] Air Conditioning???

Eron,

If it was the original, it should work &quot;ok&quot;...make sure the fins a 
straight and *clean*.  Fin combs at the hardware store(I think).

Make sure the fans work well and the a/c(even in a bus) should be ok.

Used to work for VPC where we made them....I think my condensors in 
mine(78) are larger than 3x3 though.  I really haven't looked yet.

My buddy that was the engineer on the VW bus a/c projects was just up
a couple of weeks ago and said he would get me a sanden compressor from
his supplier as a &quot;sample&quot;.&lt;thank god for college buddies!&gt;

Cheers, dave

&gt; Quick question... I was curious if anyone had installed A/C in their
&gt; car.
&gt; the original 3'x3' unit that mounted beneath the vehicle, but I can't 
&gt; imagine it would do the job as well as a new one.
