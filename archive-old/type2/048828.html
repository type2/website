&gt; no real modifications needed
&gt; jamie
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Consider replacing the whole system with the heat exchangers and muffler
&gt; &gt; from the 72-74 or 79-83 Type 2.  These had exhaust manifolds integrated with
&gt; &gt; the heat exchangers.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; course, you may need to replace some sheet metal in the cooling system under
&gt; &gt; there, and there may be differences with the sheet metal heat risers going
&gt; &gt; to the flap boxes, and I'm not sure how the 72-74 boxes hook up with the
&gt; &gt; alloy cooling shoud.  If anyone knows, I'd be pleased to find out.


this may have made it to the list already, but the exhaust ports are a
different shape
for a 77 (oval vs. sqaure)  than the years mentioned above.
 
They aren't going to fit unless you want to change out the heads,too. Of
course, since I know
where a perfect set of 74 heater boxes are, I've been thinking about
getting &quot;new&quot; heads for my
77. It's almost cheaper than heater boxes for the thing :P
 
so basically, yes, the other exhaust will fit, provided you have square
exahust ports.
