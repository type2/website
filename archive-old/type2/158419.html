&gt; Are you kidding? GM lawsuit!!!!! I'd be swimming in money! (Assuming they

&gt; Recently, the big (small b) Three, Ford, GM, and Chrysler went to see
that bad ol' BIg Gov to get somethin' done about those pesky furrin
automobiles...My guess would be an attempt to dump the pensions
on the Gov't (that'd be you an' me an' all the other taxpayers... ;-(

I find it rather blackly amusing, that the champions of free enterprise
when it comes to profits, are more than willing to socialise anything
that might impinge on their bottom line...

BTW, I &quot;think&quot; every car in this years Indy Race has a Honda engine...
Anyone confirm this...?-)
