Subject: Re: [T2] Just Kampers

My 78 had three point in the rear. Is this stock? Looks like it. If you want
pictures Rick let me know.

&gt; &gt;Has anyone here in the states purchased anything from Just Kampers in the
&gt; &gt;UK? I'm interested in their 3-point replacement seat belts for the back
&gt; &gt;seat
&gt; &gt;and was wondering how the overseas shipping went.
&gt;
&gt; If shipping is a hundred dollars, it may be worth it, just to get a kit.
&gt;
&gt; I've looked into doing something like this myself, using my old front belts.
&gt; (I replaced my front belts with retracting belts from a Beetle.) Presumably
&gt; there's some major drilling involved; otherwise, I just don't see how it
&gt; could mount. Even if you anchor it beneath the seats, and use a loop device
&gt; over the shoulder (as I've seen in a few vehicles), it requires some dodgy
&gt; jury-rigging that just doesn't seem entirely safe to me. Has anybody else
&gt; undertaken a project like this? I'd love to put shoulder belts on all my
&gt; seats, if I could see a way to do it.
