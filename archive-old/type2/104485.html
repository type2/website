Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust stud dilemma 

Mark- No Problem !!!  Just use the oem Vernacular !!!
Remove the upper cylinder tin and all 8 head nuts.
The washers will shake out when the head is off.
Under the cylinders is a small piece of tin with a
tiny ( 5mm ) slot-head screw which will allow you
to bend the tin down when it is removed.
The machinist will be happy to see that one, too:)

Subject: [T2] exhaust stud dilemma 


&gt; That's right folks, I broke one of the rear studs while removing the 
&gt; driver's side exhaust manifold on my 75 bus. Disappointing indeed. 
&gt; After much archive research and a few phone calls, armed with Muir's 
&gt; book and a socket set, I spent the afternoon attempting to remove the 
&gt; cylinder head- no luck. It seemed from others' posts that I should be 
&gt; able to remove it without dropping the engine. I got the rocker-arms 
&gt; and push rods out easily enough, but the head absolutely will not budge.
&gt; 
&gt; So, this is a cry for help. Can anyone suggest something I would have 
&gt; missed? My specific maintenance experience is mostly limited to Vespa 
&gt; scooters...my goal is to get the head off in order to deal with the 
&gt; broken stud, but this one has me baffled.
