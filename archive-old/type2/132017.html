Subject: Re: [T2] Stock wheel color

Wheel colors changed in 71 or 72 (not sure ..) from white to silver. I
believe the correct white for the earlier wheels would be pastel white L90D.
Silver is correct for later T2b bays.

&gt; Does anyone have a picture of a stock 71 Transporter? I am curious to
&gt; know what color the wheels were. My bus has chrome ones.
L91 silver. Here's an original wheel before it was repainted:
