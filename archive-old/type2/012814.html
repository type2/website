After a lot of testing, removing the engine, tearing down the 3-4 bank.

What do I find as the most likley cause of the backfire?

No it wasn't that !

The little spring clip came out of the lifter and the part that contacts
the pushrod was bound up at a very tight angle.

The engine quit almost immediately when this happened.

The lifter bore looks OK, feels OK.

If there was any damage I did it by driving the car 8 blocks home at High
Rpm.

I'm going to check the camshaft lift with a dial gauge against another
intale lobe lift and if it checks out I'm going back together after I
bust the glaze on #3 and install new rings, and of course drop in a new
$58.00 lifter and new pushrod.

I will probably dis-assemble and vat the head to check for any cracks
etc. and just hand lap the valves.

I don't think anybody could have called this one, I've never seen a
lifter come apart unless it was just way over revved. I know for a fact
that this engine has never been over 4,500 RPM since the date I installed
it 35,000 miles ago.

Thanks to all of those that showed an interest and offered solutions.
