Subject: Re: [T2] the Little Brakes that wouldn't (the punch line) 

&gt; All fluids changed.  Seat belts located.  Now there's just the oil light
&gt; that won't go out.............swapped in two new pressure switches
&gt; without result.  I don't suppose the full-flow filter could be responsible
&gt; for that?  Sticking pressure relief valves?

Or lack of prime.
you can prime the oil pump by squirting oil in the sender hole. fill it up
rotate fill it up. try again.
