Subject: VW tool vendor

Mike,

I noticed that one too and made a bookmark.

http://www.vwalley_dot_com/

I contacted a fellow there, Chris Kraum, and made a plea for a good drum/hub
puller, maybe if there is more interest on this list we can convince him to
make them!

I plan on getting their case splitter for aid in rebuilding a 1500 block
that was &quot;recently rebuilt&quot; and seized last fall.

&gt;Subject: A little tool shopping help

&gt;Hello everyone, a couple or so weeks ago someone on this list posted a link
to
&gt;a site selling vw specialty tools.I have scoured my favorites to no avail
so I
&gt;must not have saved it. D'oh!!!
&gt;I can't even remember the name, all that I can recall is that 1)it was a
small
&gt;father&amp;son or mom&amp;pop type of operation and 2)They had some sort of pinup
girl
&gt;on one of their pages.
&gt;I know it's not much to go on, but if anyone knows what I am talking about,
&gt;please drop me a line.
&gt;Thanks
&gt;mike
