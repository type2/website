&gt; I have a '79 Bus with the stock 2.0L fuel injected flat four.  I had the
&gt; bus stored all winter, and it fired right up when I went to move it last
&gt; week.  I started it again today, and it ran great for a few minutes.
&gt; After idling for some time, I revved the motor.  Sounded great, but when
&gt; she returned to idle, the idle kept getting slower and slower until she
&gt; stalled.  It would start back up but only run for a few seconds and
&gt; stall.  Then it wouldn't start at all, just continue turning over.

Mr. Cupples,

Can you keep the bus running by feathering the throttle?
If so then look for a vacuum hose that has come adrift.

If the engine dies regardless then look to an ignition or injection
problem.  First check dwell and timing. Next check the wiring for the FI
system.

                             OOK!
