if you have ever raced, you would know that increasing the engine
displacement and using the same CORRECT jetting (on the old engine) will
result in jetting that is too lean. Increasing the jet sizes is the
solution.

Theory gives way to experience this time.
I'm not trying to come across as arrogant, but you have to fatten up the
main jets if the displacement is increased.
