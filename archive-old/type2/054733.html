Subject: Progress report on 70 Westy resto

Hello all!

Just thought I'd give you a quick update on the status
of my '70 Westy.

Went to the body shop today and had a pleasent
surprise.  The bus was green!  The pop-top and luggage
rack had been repaired and repainted a metallic gull
grey early last week, and the bus itself was painted
on friday!  The exterior, interior and engine
comparment are a dark metalic green with the belt line
hump being painted the gull grey all the way around. 
The bumpers and the wheels are also painted the grey. 


Today they were buffing it out, and let me tell ya, it
looked fantastic.  The colors complement eachother
very well.  I'm going to be scared to drive it once I
finally get it back.  They've had it since last
october, had a busy time over the winter, and I should
have it back in a week or so.  Droped off the new
windshield and all the new rubber today, and they will
be installing that in a day or so.  I'm still missing
a few pieces of rubber (rubber for rear driver's vent
wing, rubber for passenger side rear window, and both
front door seals).

Price for all this work is going to be around $7000. 
A lot more then I was hoping considering the bus was
in very good shape, but with the amount of prep work
and the results they've achieved, I think it's worth
every penny!

Get to start putting it all together very soon!
