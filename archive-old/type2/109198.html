Subject: RE: [T2] fuel inFection questions

 If I remember my history correctly fuel injection technology was
created for the aircraft industry.  Had something to do with
carburators not functioning/atomizing the mixture correctly at
different altitudes/air density.  So, if an altitude compensation
was required for fuel injection I would be surprised.  If you ever
come across a picture of this compensator I would love to see it.  I
am always so fascinated with the various engineering feats that VW
has come up with over the years.

 I remember vaguely
&gt; that high altitude buses had a switch for altitude
&gt; compensation and those two wires went to it, but I have
&gt; never seen one.....
