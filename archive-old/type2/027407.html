Yes (Wini conversion).
The 95 I have does have a drivers side airbag.
We get 22mpg on the highway with the AC running in the mountains, and about 
20 in the city with AC. A mile or two more with out the AC running. Its an 
automatic.

&gt;Is your 95
&gt;EVC the type that has Winnebago cabinets (a Eurobago)?
&gt;  I wasn't aware that 95 EVCs came with a drivers air
&gt;bag.  With Eurobagos I thought 95s had no air bags at
&gt;all, and you had to go to the 97 V6 models to get
&gt;them.  What kind of mileage do you get with your 95,
&gt;and is it an automatic?
