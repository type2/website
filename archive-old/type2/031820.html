&gt; Yesterday I was driving my 79 ASI VW and out of nowhere it started making a
&gt; loud &quot;exhaust leak&quot; like noise.  It seemed to lose some power too, and would

&gt; any damage.

sounds like maybe a head leak...

hmmmmmm. easy way to check... I guess a compression test should do it real
quick.

what happens is a head is not pulled down tight or some other non seal
issue and the exhaust wears away the metal and soon you have a
&quot;Leak&quot; almost like a little channel carved in the head that allows the
exhaust gas to escape.._dot_usually means a new head, possibly a cyl or piston
