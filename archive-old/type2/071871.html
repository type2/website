Subject: Looking for 1968-1971 Bus parts In Florida
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Everyone,

I am a lurker on this list and only occasionally post. I am in the process of 
trying to restore a 1971 crew cab but am in DESPERATE need of some parts. 
Don't freak out, I don't need bed gates!  I'm looking  for some standard BUS 
parts for my truck. You see, my truck had a Corvair drive train in it when I 
purchased it. I have since sold the engine and trans but I still have all the 
conversion pieces (anyone interested?). The problem is that I need many Bus 
parts in order to put things back to VW. I need a transmission, all of the 
mounts, the engine cradle mount, and any misc linkage. My dream is to find a 
trashed 1971 Bus for a parts vehicle but I cannot afford more that a couple 
of hundred dollars to purchase the vehicle. I have been looking for nearly a 
year now with no such luck. I know the cheap busses are out there but I just 
can't seem to find them. So, I am coming to the list for help. Is there 
anyone in the Tampa, St Pete, Lakeland, Orlando, etc areas of Florida that 
might have what I need or know of a cheap parts busses for sale?  I would 
also love to have some underside pictures of a stock bus so I can compare 
what has been altered on mine. JPG images are fine!
Thanks so much in advance.
Dave
