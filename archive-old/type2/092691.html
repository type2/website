Subject: Re: [T2] My bus runs! YAY!


&gt;I'd like to know how to test the vacuume line that runs under the bus, 
&gt;because i don't want an extra vacuume leak...

Take the line off at the engine - put it in your mouth and suck.

Right before you pass out, cap off the line with your tongue and wait about 
1/2 an hour to see if the vacuum leaks off.

&lt;grin&gt;

A better way would be to use a Mity-Vac tool that can be purchased at 
Sears, Northern Tools, Harbor Freight I expect, etc.

You use it to pull a vacuum and then watch the gauge to see if it holds it 
and a reasonable amount of time...

I'm sure there are numbers to check but if it would hold vacuum for several 
minutes then I would feel good about it.
