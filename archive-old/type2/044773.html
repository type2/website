Subject: [T2] Spin Out part 2

Last week I spun my 68 DC when I'd left my gas cap loose and gas poured out
on my rear wheel causing the spin. Last night I heard a low growl from the
Right rear wheel when turning left but it would go away when driving
straight or turning right. I figured a wheel bearing or CV joint was on the
way south. My 17 year old son need a ride home from work at 10:00pm last
night and he heard what we thought was a rock in the hub cap, I made a
mental note to have a look in the morning. Well I had to go to work at 5 am
and remembered to look under the RR hub cap and what did I find? A 3 piece
cotter pin, now , I've never seen one of those! What must have happened was
when I spun that wheel had severe torque on it and it sheared the cotter
pin. The howl I'd heard was the drum loosening on the axel! All is well
after breaking out the 3/4 inch breaker bar and 46mm socket.
