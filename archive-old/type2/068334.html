     Hi,  Dave Easterwood put up some of my slides from Sunray Bugs that I 
     took in the summer.  I just got my scanner and am learnign the ropes 
     of writing web pages but in the meantime you can see these (courtesy 
     of Mr. Easterwood) at:

     Corky and family run this groovy shop in Dade City, FL.  They are good 
     people.  He has recently put up a web site but the address I hurriedly 
     got from them at the BUG Jam this weekend doesn't work.  I'll try to 
     find it and will post.
     Ray
