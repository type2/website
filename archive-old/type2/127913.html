Subject: RE: 82 Vanagon mileage

&gt;I'm looking at an '82 Vanagon &amp; wondered about gas mileage.... It's been a 
&gt;long time since I had an air cooled VW....
&gt;Besides my gas mileage question is there anything &quot;special&quot; I should be  aware
&gt;of with an '82?

H Rob,

I can tell you about my 81 air cooled. It has about 200K on it, and averages
around 21 mpg. I am not much for splitting hairs with mpg. I just use it to make
sure it is running right. We travel Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, and Utah, so long
grades and steep passes are all around, and the mpg stays pretty consistent. On
the freeway, I stick it on 67 mph, 3800RPM, and it just moves me, my three
children, and all our camping  gear just fine.  On occasion, I have done nearly
24mpg in a 1200 mile jaunt, but i don't count on that happening very often.  

As you know with air cooled engines, oil matters even more than with its watered
down brothers. Some folks say optimum oil temp and consumption occurs with the
oil level in the middle of the dipstick marks, between down a quart, and full. I
don't have the luxury of trying that out, as mine blows a lot of oil. No
burning, just main seal leaks at high speeds, or so I believe, so I have to keep
a close eye on the dipstick. It is not consistent in that consumption, but
sometimes I am into it for 4 and  even 5  quarts on a 1200 mile jaunt. Beats
crawling under and changing the oil myself! :-) I believe that is one reason it
is in as good a shape as it is, after all those miles. 

 I installed an oil temp gauge, which is a mixed blessing, as when it starts
getting hot, there is nothing I can do about it &lt;g&gt; I just make sure to keep the
tin in  place, keep the oil cooler clean, and the gunk off the motor as much as
I can. With all that, if the fan is turning and theromstat is working, I just
keep driving it, even when it gets up to the 250 degree, and maybe a tad more,
mark. I was a skeptic for many years, but have learned that the engine works
just like it was designed, and so I trust it a bit more. I have seen it go
higher, and at that point I usually take an extended rest stop, and certainly
avoid stressing it anymore if I can avoid it. 

I am very happy with my  air cooled, as the waterboxers have a world all their
own to deal with. :-) 

FWIW, I use 20-50W all the time. 

Hard to find anything simpler without getting a diesel.

Enjoy!

John
