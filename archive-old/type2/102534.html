Subject: squeaking belt

HI all, On my new 2.0 liter (dual dell '72 westy)  When I am accelerating or under a heavy load, my alt belt starts to whine.  with no electrical load, that is: lights off, fan off,  wipers off etc.  I dressed the belt with Bowman Industrial belt dressing and it did not stop it.  Minimal belt deflection too.  So my personal opinion says it is tight enough.

May be wrong kind of belt?  Continental, I think.  What size and type is OEM?

Paul.
