I recently had the same problems.  Check the rubber bushing on the front of
the shift rod. Under the front pan and in front of the shifter underneath.
Mine had completely worn away so the shft rod was not turning to the
correct angle to hit the corrert gears.

the remedy is easy.  Call Old Volks Home and for a few dollars a new
bushing and some new grease should fix your problem
