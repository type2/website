&gt;It appears to be hanging up on the bottom of the vent window. Does anyone 
&gt;know how to remove this?

There is a screw inside the door and one up top to remove the vent wing.  
You need to remove the weather stripping to get to the top screw.  It's a 
pain, but Bentley has a good list of steps and lots of pictures.
