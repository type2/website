Hi, 
Seems as though when I attempt to respond to a listee's messages, and
use the &quot;reply all&quot; format, the message kicks back to me, as
undeliverable.
But if I just respond to the person who generated the topic, it works
just fine, or, if I go to &quot;write a message&quot;, with zero prior
attatchment's ( message I am responding to) everythings OK, sometimes.

And lately I can't even post a message to the list----
Any idea's?

Thanks Much,
