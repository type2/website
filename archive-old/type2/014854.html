I guess every AAA &quot;chapter&quot; is different. AAA Potomac ( Mid Atlantic region)
said I had to be a member for 3 yrs before &quot;qualifying&quot; for the Plus. Also, 6
yrs ago I was in Florida in a rental car, ran out of gas at a toll booth. Tow
truck with AAA goes by ( not towing a car) I yell to the guy &quot;Hey, I'm a AAA
member and I need gas&quot; The SOB yelled back, &quot;Call it in&quot; and took off. I'm
glad your experience with them has been good, but they will never see another
penny from me.    Jeff
