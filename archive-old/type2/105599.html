Subject: EveryBus event info - Please Read

Hi,

The 5th annual EveryBus (www.everybus_dot_com) will be starting in just 
over one week. For those who do not know about EB it is one of the 
larger east coast bus camping events. Do a google search on everybus 
to find out about EBs of the past.

This years event is shaping up nicely and I have just updated the web site.
*Activities page has been updated with Canadian breakfast info
*Weather link added
*The carabus page is back by popular demand. If you are going to 
EveryBus there is a page on the site listing people from different 
parts of the continent that will be attending. You can use the list 
to find folks to travel with. If you want to be added to the list 
send an e-mail to this address or the one on the page. I will try and 
update it twice a day for the next 7 days. The carabus list is a 
great resource so please sign up.

The weather in NC is BEAUTIFUL. The trees are leafing out and the 
flowers are blooming.

If you want to bring bus parts to sell please do. Every year, more 
and more cool parts show up.

Check out the web site for all the details.

Thanks
Chris
