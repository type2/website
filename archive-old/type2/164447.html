Subject: Seat belts

Since I just turned 60, I have had lotsa experiences with...and without...seat
belts, of either type, but I know for sure that the VW &quot;fixed&quot; belts, held me
upside down in a wrecked Beetle, for 1 hour, until &quot;they&quot; could cut me out of
the car!  It is really odd to regain consciouness(sic), and find the roof is
on the ground, and there is a battery next to you hanging by the battery post
cables, but I am just like the &quot;rest&quot;, and prefer the flexibility of
&quot;retracts&quot; to do/reach things, and &quot;trust&quot; their makers, they will work when
needed, other than the windshield, door posts, or others who are flying around
in the accident who did not have seat belts on, and are still travelling at
the velocity of the impact zone!
