Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Brake Booster Removal


Correct me here if I am wrong but isn't Brake fluid in the booster a sign
of a leaking master cylinder? You should rebuild or replace that master
cylinder before the fluid destroys your booster, which is even more
expensive. Master cylinders are easy to rebuild and I believe cheap to
replace.

Mine had brake fluid in it.

Maybe 1/4 cup.


Rinsed it twice with a bottle of alcohol each
time.  Shook it out let it dry over night...hope it works fine&lt;grin&gt;.

If it worked with the brake fluid in it, I suspect it would work just fine
without it also.

Cheers, dave

&gt;
&gt; Yes. While it's out check to see that it doesn't contain brake fluid.
