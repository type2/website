Mickey-

That EGR light is turned on every 15k(?) miles by a little black box mounted
inline with the speedo cable and located &quot;behind&quot; the driver's kickpanel
(i.e. between the kickpanel and the sheetmetal) near the headlight.  The
collision probably tripped the contact in the box.  The box might also be
causing the weird noise you're hearing - there's a bunch of gears in there
that are probably no longer running smoothly.

If this is the noise problem, you might a) replace the box with a spare from
a junker, b) try what another recent poster did and remove most of the works
from the box, or c) try replacing the entire length of the speedo cable with
a box-free version. Or just ignore it.

Hope that helps!

&gt; Last night I was on my way home from my first signifigant camp
&gt; outing, two
&gt; days of fly fishing and camping on the Green River near Pinedale Wyoming.
&gt; Cruising at about 65 in Retro my 75 westy. All of the sudden
&gt; Bambi decides
&gt; that the grass is greener on the other side of highway 191. Before I knew
&gt; it there was a huge thump and then the sound of my mountain bike
&gt; which was
&gt; racked on the spare tire grinding and skidding under my wheels.
&gt; Aside from
&gt; the bike being totaled a 700$ loss damage was not too bad. I lost a
&gt; headlight and the forementioned spare tire. A big dent in the nose. There
&gt; is now a slight  thump thump..thump thump that is more noticable at low
&gt; speed. the alignment is fine and the breaks pull evenly but this noise is
&gt; new.  One other thing that is wierd the EGR light came on right after the
&gt; crash. Muir says this light comes on automatically every 15000 miles ..
