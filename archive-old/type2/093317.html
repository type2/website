Subject: Re: [T2] Adding Oxygen Sensor.


&gt; From what I can tell the ECU can accommodate an oxygen sensor on pins 24
&gt;and 23 (shield). Has anyone ever added a sensor to a federal vehicle?
&gt;Does only the ECU for CA support the oxygen sensor as I think the ECU's
&gt;for CA have different part numbers than the federal ones? One difference
&gt;is that the CA ECU's do not need the series resistors for the injectors.

Yes, as I understand it the rich fuel mixture can cause the catalytic 
converter to MELT at high speeds. The extra gasoline  continues to combust 
in the cat?

Anyhow I believe all of the Vanagons and the busses starting in '79 had 
oxygen sensors. If you have the original engine harness and original 
computer it should be a plug in affair.

Can you give us the part# for the computer and somebody will know (usually 
Karl) if that is the right computer. I can check ETKA also.

In theory I would GUESS that a bum Vanagon computer could be swapped for an 
earlier non-oxygen sensor equipped transporter computer which would not 
support the sensor. If may be a situation where you've got the pins but not 
the electronics to run that oxygen sensor.
