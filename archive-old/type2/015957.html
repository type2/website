I've been a lurker for some time now since I don't yet own a bus.
Have been looking at a '78 westy and looking for opinions.

Interior in *great* shape. body decent. Rockers pretty bad, typical
rust spots under windshield &amp; other seams that current owner
sanded and arrested. One bad place is frame/rocker area below
passenger seat.  Side door opens and closes well.  New tires &amp; canvas. 
Top seal fair but doesn't leak. All electrical stuff works (including
lighter, 
rear defroster, directionals, etc.). Current 3rd owner (17 year old) bought
it 2.5 years ago, yanked the motor, completely rebuilt it with new parts
&gt;from local 
reputable VW parts place, and put 12K miles on it touring around. Has been 
converted to single carb (2nd owner did that I think) and is currently in 
need of a carb and doesn't run.  He seems sincere and honest about the
condition
of the bus, but I can't drive it.  Was asking $3K but now asking $1.6K, and
I'd probably offer him $1K and go from there. Bus has 92K  miles.
Lots of receipts (~$3K)and work orders to document mileage and work he and 
mechanics have done.  

I can likely scrape up $2K max to buy it, replace carb (he has 2 that
he says are 'bad' but may not be) and fix other misc. stuff to get it
on the road.  Wife likes busses (good mutal friends have a '71 westy), 
supports the purchase of it and the $2K, but it'd have to end there 
(she makes the bacon in the family, and I add lots of school debt and a 
paltry postdoc salary).

Am I likely  buying a nightmare? I've worked quite a bit on american cars,
don't mind getting dirty, have tools, etc. but also can't have the 
bus sitting in our (shared) back yard for extended periods of time.

Advice much appreciated.
Thanks kindly

Patrick
