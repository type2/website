&gt; Hi all, I have a full length roof rack on my '66 Westy with the middle
&gt; bars cut out for the pop-top (I got it that way so don't yell at me) and I
&gt; was wondering if I can use it on my '73 bus (no pop-top).  It has four
&gt; legs on each side which sit in the gutter.  Come to think of it, is there
&gt; anyone who knows where I could get some decent hold-down clamps for this
&gt; thing?  Right now I just have some nylon straps and I don't trust them too

Yes, you can use it.

As far as clamps, I've seen repro clamps for $20 at the shows.  Don't
know where you can order them, tho...
