&gt; Are you saying that it is possible to have a Type 2 that doesn't leak at 
&gt; least a little oil?  I'm sure there are varying degrees, but just about 
&gt; everyone seems to have some kind of oil leak issue.  Just curious.

When I first bought my bus, it didn't drop a bit of oil.  When I rebuilt 
my engine, it was totally clean.. that was until the pushrod tube 
leaked.  Now it's totally dry under there!  Pretty amazed myself ;)
