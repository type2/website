Subject: Re: [T2] Mechanical fuel pump question

&gt;Would anyone know if you have to pull the engine to replace the mechanical
&gt;fuel pump on a type IV pancake engine in a bus?  Mine is weeping gas and
&gt;probably needs to be replaced.  It is located in the lower right front of
&gt;the engine (tranny side) attached to the case by what looks to be a torx or
&gt;star bolt.

No you don't. Pull it in place. May require some lower tin to be removed.

Check the whole fuel system for leaks and replace all aged fuel lines. 
(It's a life mission of mine to tell EVERYONE this).
