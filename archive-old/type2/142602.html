&gt;I decide to find out just WHAT is going on with my power loss when the

&gt;#2 and #4 are both too tight. Doh! I must have missed the mark on the
&gt;pulley last time. Readjust.

The valves dwell in the closed position for several degrees of crank rotation. Be sure they aren't really moving...

&gt;Fire it up and the RPMs run up to 1200. I let it run that way for a
&gt;bit to warm up, but the rpms won't kick down. Head back to slow down
&gt;the idle. I turn the screw and turn and turn and... seats. WTF? Idle
&gt;didn't change. Just to make sure, I disconnected the linkage and
&gt;backed out the stop screws on the throttles. No effect. Out comes the
&gt;carb cleaner and I start spraying around. Nothing. Must be the volume
&gt;screws. No worries...

Dashpot, chokes?
