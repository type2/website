&gt;&gt; I guess you just have to keep a good
&gt;&gt; (complete) set of points around just in case, huh?
&gt; 
&gt; I think that's what I'll do from now on!

I carry a set of points for pertronix backup.  I have no idea what to do
with them however!  Never dealt with points, always had e-ignition either
factory or PO installed.  Just thought it was a good idea.  Hmm maybe I
should open the box and have me a look.

Later, Nik
