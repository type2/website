Subject: Re: [T2] steering box

Hi Bradley,

Before you replace the steering box,  be sure to inspect the rubber 
bushing at the bottom of the steering.

Mine failed about two years ago while parking in my driveway. Dad's 81 
Vanagon chewed one up (Vanagons have two) a week after he brought it 
home.  As these break they tend to get sloppy first, then let go 
entirely when you put some torque into them.

It's a fairly inexpensive part, and can be replaced in about half an 
hour or less.


Happy trails,

&gt; I have checked out the drag screw on the box and it is adjusted per 
&gt; Bentley specs.  I also put on new tie rods from the Bus Depot, thanks 
&gt; Ron, and had the alignment done by Goodyear - reliable mechanics and a 
&gt; good job.
&gt;
&gt; Are there any good steering boxes out there?  I know that most, if not 
&gt; all, are rebuilt just looking for suggestions on whom has a well 
&gt; re-built one.
