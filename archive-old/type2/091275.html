Subject: window mechanizm fix

My driver's side window winder is stripped (not the
handcrank, but the internal mechanism.
The boneyard stuff I've found is highly questionable.
Can one overhaul the winding gizmo one'sself? Parts?

If not, Any ideas on modifications? I would love to
put something like the old splittie sliding window in.

(For the time being I have a three-position notched
stick inside the door. Full up, half up, and down.
Fred Flintstone would be impressed.)
