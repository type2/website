Subject: RE: [T2] heating a bus

Does anybody make new ones or rebuild these gas heaters? I have seen them on
Ebay for $400+ dollars. I cannot afford this kind of dough for something
used and half worn out. Hate to just by junk. I would pay this price for
something new or rebuild with warrantee.

FIX THAT GAS HEATER!!  A gas heater is the BEST way to heat a bus, but  you
need to rebuild your heater, change the fuel lines and put a new exhaust on
it.  If you need rebuild parts, go to:
