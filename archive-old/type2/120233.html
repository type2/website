Subject: Don't you just hate that?

You'd think that by now I'd know not to tempt Fate, fickle bitch that she 
is, noooo, I had to go and skite about how well Tigger was handling day to 
day transport requirements.

Therefore, OF COURSE, the next morning when I started her she was running 
like a dog, idle rough &amp; at about 5-600 revs etc. After a day of panic 
about serious damage and humongous repair bills, it was a 10 second fix, 
user error again ;^)

Tom replied to my comment about wiring fuel hoses on with the Aircooled 
Junkyard article that mentioned it, but it ALSO mentioned fires caused by 
deteriorated fuel filler hoses, and described how to check, so I thought, 
just to be safe, I'd go check, so I went down, popped out the plate &amp; 
checked the filler hose ( having forgotten, as I do all too often 
nowadays, that it was replaced 4-5 years ago, and was therefore fine ). 
ANYWAY, in the process of popping out the plate I knocked the wire for the 
idle control off the right hand carb, hence the 10 second fix to end the 
day of panic ;^)

As I said to a friend last night, I'll take looking like a fool over a 
big, expensive, repair job anyday ;^)
