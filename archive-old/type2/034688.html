&gt;
&gt; Against my better judgement and the advice of this list, i ordered something
&gt; from MOFOCO.

*grin*


&gt; how can they screw up reground
&gt; lifters?&quot;.
&gt;

Its MOFOCO...how do they stay in business? oh yeah...they soak you for $$ at
Bugfest!!

I am ashamed to be in the same state as them... at Bugfest..people made signs to
show how much they hated mofoco...turnout at bugfest seems to be on the decline
from what I hear....
