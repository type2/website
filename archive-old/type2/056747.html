Subject: Re: Rear hatch -- interior latch?

mike raises a good point about people falling out...

a westy i parted out (dont know if this is original or add on) had an
extra latch on the drivers side, one of those like you use to bolt a door
from the inside.  It looked like an excellent safety feature to have even
if you dotn have a wire loop to pull.... i would hate to see a friend fall
out the back of my bus on the highway because of a defective latch.

also, locking the rear hatch does no good at preventing someone from
pulling the wire to get out/fall out as this can be operated whether the
exterior handle is locked or not.

thanks,

Steve
