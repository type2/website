hehe

one important thing that _everyone_ seems to miss is that it takes a LOT
of energy and resources to make a new car.  This causes pollution waste
and all kinds of nastiness, as does disposing of cars that are used up.

I think you could drive your bus for 30 years before you equal the
pollution and waste generated to make one jeep cherokee...

But, as we know, people dont drive the new cars for 30 years to realize
the savings in their more efficient design, they scrapem and get a new one
thus the newer cars are causing more waste and pollution rather than less
in a way.  the pollution is just distributed to where the factories are
instead of in the air near your house so no-one cares.

just MHO,

p.s. if you want to be greener put a catalytic convertor on your bus,
maybe get a closed loop FI system from an aftermarket vendor (or use stock
VW FI if you have a 72-newer.  Personally i dont like the FI on aircooled
vw's.  I'd retrofit a rabbit CIS unit or use aftermarket efi.  I gurantee
that'll put you way ahead of those new car polluters :)
