Sounds like the symptoms of pure destruction..

Maybe a dropped valve, maybe a spun rod bearing....was the oil level in
check?

Valves have a history of snapping and creating havoc in a cylinder...You may
need our services, or Boston Bob......

Subject: [T2] Sudden Loud Clatter, and then a Dead Engine...


&gt; I bought my 75 bus (1.8L FI) at the beginning of the summer and have put
&gt; about 2500 miles on it so far with not more than a few hiccups as I've
been
&gt; learning the ropes.  The PO said that a &quot;re-built&quot; engine went in 25,000
&gt; miles ago but other than that I know nothing about this bus's history
&gt; (including whether the odometer has rolled once or more!-it now reads
80k).
&gt;
&gt; Today as I was on a short trip to the beach on back roads going 20-30 mph,
&gt; with no engine noises to signal what was coming, a loud clatter from the
&gt; engine suddenly came on and the engine cut out.  I immediately put the
&gt; clutch in and went to neutral and the clatter stopped, but that was it for
&gt; my beach trip; now if I try to turn the engine over I get only the sound
of
&gt; the starter solenoid ??(the click) but no turnover.  I'm towing it home
&gt; tomorrow after which I'll be able to give it a more thorough look.  Can
&gt; anyone venture a guess as to what my problem is, tests I might try to
locate
&gt; it, or other friendly advice??  I have tools and manuals, but not a lot of
&gt; experience here.
&gt;
&gt; I couldn't see anything obviously wrong from the outside, though something
&gt; that is probably unrelated did catch my eye: the thermostat ? (spring
gizmo
&gt; near the oil pan) has a cable which has broken and is not connected
&gt; anywhere.  There is a pulley wheel above it that I imagine the cable
running
&gt; over and then on to its destination: where does this cable go?  Any chance
&gt; this is related to my current situation?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance for any help..
