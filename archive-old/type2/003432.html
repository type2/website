Subject: Fw: Timing question 2 liter motor Type 4 vanagon


&gt; &gt; Volks,
&gt; &gt; I am having issues with my timing.  I have the stock distributor, and I
am
&gt; &gt; trying to set it at 42 degrees total advance( I believe that is correct
&gt; for
&gt; &gt; a vanagon)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The problem is that when I try to set the total advance, the timing
mark
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; jumping around all over the place. Under the distributor drive gear
there
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; one weird looking washer, that is all.  The engine has a good brass gear
&gt; on
&gt; &gt; the crank (recently rebuilt)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I tried putting on a newly rebuilt distributor, and same result.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any ideas?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ( I have a snap-on timing light, and due to the location of the battery,
I
&gt; &gt; hook it up to a spare shop battery and then clip to #1 spark plug wire)
&gt; &gt;
