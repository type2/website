Subject: it lives!!

my bus was driven today for the first time since Everybus......

rebuilt tranny
rebuilt torque convertor
Boston (Bob) engine
new wiring harness.
new windshield (don't ask)

this morning I put gas and power to her and she fired right up (well
after I found the hose that was off)

still lots of little things to be done but it now has 11 miles on new
engine!!!!  big smile, and mucho big thanks to folks on this list who
helped not sure I would have had the intestinal fortitude to continue
with out the cheering squad!!!

Bob
