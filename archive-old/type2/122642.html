Subject: Re: [T2] child cot in front

Hi Jason,

The best way to check the authenticity of a baywindow westfalia is the 
VIN. If the second digit is a 3, then it's a genuine Westfalia.

Happy trails,

&gt; I took a look on thesamba in the manual section at the closest

&gt; the 70 and it is a westfalia camper bus it should either have the
&gt; mounts for the cot or holes where the mounts were. Its also possible
&gt; she doesn't actually have a genuine campmobile?
