Subject: Dizzyness: Canister on wrong side

Recently got a vacuum advance distributor from my flaps; has the canister
on the wrong side of the dizzy. Flaps guy says you can just turn the dizzy
180 and swap the 1-3 and 2-4 wires. I tried this and got that big, ugly
backfiring sound (sounded like an AFM-disabling backfire :(, though I don't
know). I'm charging the battery now, so I'll wait a while before I try
anything else.

Anyway, does his advice sound right? I'm a little confused on the
relationship between the cam, valve position, and timing, but it seems to
me that you could not successfully install a dizzy 180 out unless you also
installed the distributor timing gear 180 out.

Thanks! Joe
