Todd and the list,
I've benn doing some preliminary investigating and it appears that my cv's
are in good shape, rotors and stubs are ok, and the gear lube that came out
of the transaxle appeared to be clean as can be..... So as you suspect the
clutch, so do I.  I'm going to try to have the bus towed to my fathers
garage (heated) and drop the eng and trans and split them and see what I
find.  By the way, the clutch assem was all Sachs brand,  purchased from a
list member business.  So, I'll let you all (younz) know what I find..... I
can hardly wait..... 
Thanks for your concerns.

P.S. Josh, go in peace.
