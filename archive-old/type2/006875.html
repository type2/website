Hi all,

At my wise wife's suggestion I am going to remain subscribed to the list as
a &quot;past&quot; bus owner. I enjoy the daily ritual of seeing what my many friends
are doing everyday and would miss it greatly. If I can continue to be of any
help I will.

Again thanks for all the notes many of you have sent. I have been very
touched by them all.

Scott
