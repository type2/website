My bus is a 75 with fuel injection.  After I had my motor rebuilt and I
installed it, I had a problem with jerking that was not there prior to the
rebuild.  I do most of the work on my bus myself, but could not locate the
cause after checking out everything I could think of.  
I started asking around about mechanics and had went to one who was
recommended who will remain nameless in La Harbra.  This guy had my bus for
nearly four weeks and couldn't locate the problem.

During a purchase of a aux. air regulator. From Jim at the Old Volks Home, I
told him of my problem, asking if he knew of a good mechanic in So. California
near Rancho Cucamonga.  A couple of days later he called me with the name
T.C.'s Old V-Dub Home.
Now this shop is about 50 miles from my home but what the heak, the last one
was 30.

After making arraignments with the owner Tim, I drove to his shop.  The very
next day he called me back telling me what needed to be done! (Remember the
last shop had my bus for three weeks and still did not know what the problem
was.)

Tim runs a one man shop and has been in business for over twenty years.

He has my respect.
