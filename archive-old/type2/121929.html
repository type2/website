&gt;Well, I am getting ready to start the rebuild on my 71 Westy's engine (type 1
&gt;dual port) and would like to change from the 009 Bosch distributor that's
&gt;currently there.  I've read through the archives and note that the 009 is not
&gt;the favorite among the list but every time I do search or look at the VW part
&gt;sources on line, the 009 seems to be the only available.  I was wonder about
&gt;other distributors and possible sources.
