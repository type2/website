Subject: RE: [T2] front mounted tires.


Why are we giving Muir a hard time? He's always been nice to me.
	Barry Wright

&gt; &gt; In the Idiot Book, Muir says that the spare in front
&gt; &gt; is good crash
&gt; &gt; protection.  Muir obviously didn't take physics.
&gt; &gt; ----------
&gt; &gt; Actually... he did take physics.

&gt; Perhaps so.  In that case, replace &quot;take&quot; with &quot;understand&quot;.
