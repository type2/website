&gt; Brian,
&gt; what you have is state minimums 15/30/5 15k per person,30k per accident and
&gt; 5k property damage.Nothing there to protect you or your bus. Best thing to
&gt; do is shop until you find a good price and agent.To raise your liability
&gt; limits to 1mil is fairly cheap, its the comprehensive on your vehicle that
&gt; costs.

how true, in  Maryland I have only found two companies that will put
comprehensive on an old VW daily driver.

Farmers and MetLife.

I had Farmer's and had no problem with em but 
MetLife gave me much better rates for the same coverage so I changed about
2 years ago

This information is only my experience in Baltimore area

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I did not leap in to volunteer the correct number (232,000). Not
&gt; &gt; &gt;totally honest, but made a big difference in the end.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;p.s. Sorry if I offended any list members with my flexible scruples.&lt;&lt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;i am not personally offended. its your decision &amp; if you can live with
&gt; it,
&gt; &gt; &gt;then do so.  however, my wallet is offended.  situations like this are
&gt; just
&gt; &gt; &gt;one of the reasons that insurance rates are so high. &amp; i'm not saying
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt;just to flame someone, either. i've been through similar situations &amp;
&gt; felt
&gt; &gt; &gt;that i had to add my .02 on this thread.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This fortunate misreading of the mileage in this case just saved
&gt; &gt; everyone time, money and aggravation. The outcome was that the
&gt; &gt; owner of this Bus got what he was entitled to: reimbursement of
&gt; &gt; the damage sustained in an accident that is covered by an insurance
&gt; &gt; company.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I just moved to the US and picked my Bus up in Baltimore. It needed to
&gt; &gt; be insured so we added it as a second vehicle to my girlfriends
&gt; &gt; insurance, for now. I am very suprised to see that I'm only insured
&gt; &gt; for 15K here and 15K there, it's like driving around with no insurance
&gt; &gt; at all. The standard car insurance in Holland, or the countries around
&gt; &gt; it, is something like, $2.500.000 maximum per case. 15K doesn't even
&gt; &gt; cover a few weeks in hospital. The strangest thing is that this 15K
&gt; &gt; liabillity insurance costs me twice as much as what I had in Holland,
&gt; &gt; where my Bus was also covered 'all risks' to the estimated value of
&gt; &gt; around 15K (at todays exchange rate). Insuring a 15K risk should not
&gt; &gt; cost more than $30 a months or so. The insurance companies can collect
&gt; &gt; a lot of premiums and hand out 15K here and there, great way to do
&gt; &gt; business...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Needless to say, I'm worried about someone running into my Bus in
&gt; &gt; some way. Isn't it so, that if it is values by an approved company,
&gt; &gt; to a certain value, that the insurance has to treat it as if it
&gt; &gt; was a 1999 car with a certain &quot;blue book&quot; value? I would greatly
&gt; &gt; appreciate any info on how to insure a Bus in the US, in such a way
&gt; &gt; I won't be paying someone's wheel chair the rest of my life (fingers
&gt; &gt; crossed), or loose my investment in case some uninsured driver runs
&gt; &gt; into it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; All that said, there is no way an insurance company could -really-
&gt; &gt; 'undo' the damage to my Bus, it would just never be the same.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Brian.
