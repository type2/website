Subject: Dual Solex 34/32 carbs jet size, air and fuel???

Hi guys,
I bought 13 used 34/32 Solex carbs (1972/73/74), most are in bad shape 
(i tought!!!) but!!! i got 4 buterfly shaft/assembly in very good 
condition (Various generation but no loose, thats all i was looking 
for)!!!, i also got a few level/even/straight/flat lower body (good news 
also). I got a few good upper body with the injection/pump brass tube 
still there (he he). So overhall i should be able to rebuilt 4 out of 13!

My question:
Do any of you have a chart/link/answer as to which air and fuel jet 
should be use for a stock 1700cc and 1800cc.
Most carbs have all different jet ranging from 140 to 175 for air and 
most fuel are x137.5 (some are other size but i don't remember)
Any idea?

Regards, Ben
