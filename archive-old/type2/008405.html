Item Description:
1979 VW Type 2 Westfalia camper with flat 4-Cyl. engine.
This the ultimate Microbus.
This VW has been in my family since 1981,
when my Dad bought it with 5000 miles.
I have been driving it for the last two years.
It currently has about 150,000 miles.
Speedometer cable broke about 9 months ago with
142K miles.
BAD STUFF
There was a fire in the engine compartment that burned
the generator belt, spark plug wires, air hoses, oil
filler and air breather. The fire was caused by oil
or gas dripping onto the muffler when I opened the
lid, and flashing into flame.  I got the fire out before it
could do any damage to the engine itself.  There was a
small amount of bubbling to the paint on the engine
cover and just above it, and I think my right thumbprint
is still burned into the button.  The rear mattress
has about a 10&quot; circle in the cover. The foam itself
is okay. There is surface rust all
around the body, but the only penetration is under
the winshield and under the battery compartment floor.
A paint job with normal preparation will take care of most of this.
It was involved in a collision with damage to the right
front area.  Also, it needs a new ignition switch insert.
The rubber grommet around the pop-top needs to be replaced.

Now that I've listed all the problems, here's the GOOD STUFF!

The van is completely restorable, and the engine still runs.  The interior
had no
damage and the canvas is perfect
except for one small (1 inch) tear in the screen cover
flap. This is inside the screen.  The back door screen
is in perfect shape and has only been used a couple of
times.  The interior cabinetry is all in good condition
and all moving parts move and all stationary parts don't
move.  It has a fold down rear seat that forms a nearly
double sized bed, with overhead cabinets, an upper bunk
that inside the pop-top, and a child sized hammock that
clips above the front seats.  It has a curtain that
wraps around the inside of the cab area, both side
windows and windshield.  Built-in icebox, water tank
with electric faucet, and lots of cabinet space with
a hanging wardrobe.  Wired for 110AC external power.
Class one trailer hitch.  For what it's worth, it had
a new fuel filter, complete tune up, lube and oil change the
same day before it caught fire.

This van is not pretty, but has a lot to offer to
someone who wants to restore a classic piece of
history, and have a fun way to travel.  If you
want to impress kids, just drive up in this next
to a crowd of kids and make them all say Dude! at the same time.

Successful bidder to pick it up in Clearwater, Florida or make arrangements

Payment by cashier's check or money order or by cash upon pickup.
