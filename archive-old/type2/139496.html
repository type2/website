&gt; This is right. And I can imagine Joe's retort, which would be: why 
&gt; spend $20 for a patch job when you can replace the starter for $90? And 
&gt; Joe would be right, too.


And this is the one thing that bothers *me* about sales of the *$20* WR1
&quot;kit&quot;.  

I agree that it serves a purpose as a band-aid for aging solenoids and
wiring. If the solenoid is drawing so much current that decent wiring can't
handle it then the starter probably isn't far behind. The relay can help
you get a few more months (or years even) out of that deteriorating starter
until you can afford to replace it.

Same thing if the wiring has deteriorated to the point that it can no
longer support the 30 or 40 amps that even a GOOD solenoid will draw.
The relay, generally at under 1 amp draw, will work well for quite a while.

Except, in the case of wiring deterioration one should strive mightily to
replace the bad wiring at the soonest opportunity. If a short to ground
occurs and the wiring is already weak one never knows WHERE it will catch
fire.  

OK, I've agreed it's a good band-aid. Frequently a good idea to use it. It
can even help extend the life of your NEW wiring. Reducing the number of
amps drawn through any wire increases it's life by reducing generated heat
and arcing (There is some arcing, always, even if too small to see with the
naked eye. No connection is perfect.). 

So, what bothers me about the *$20* WR1 kit? 

The fact that it costs *$20* and people keep hawking it as the
end-all/be-all best thing to buy. 

There are instructions for wiring the &quot;kit&quot; on the net. I can jump on the
unmentionable auction site and buy *10* 5 pin relays rated at 30/40 amps
12VDC for $10 + about $7 shipping. I can get the same relay at a decent
electronics store -- or even Radio Smack for about $4 each. 

If one wants a socket to plug the relay into rather than direct wiring with
spade connectors they can be had for about $1.50 each (in bulk) on the
auction site or about $5 each at a store. 

One can buy the parts for one &quot;WR1 kit&quot; for under $10. Or, if one wants to
stock a toolbox with relays and sockets (which have many uses) one can buy
10 of each for about $30 total -- about $3 per set.

Oh, the inline fuse holder may add another $0.50 - $1.00.

But everyone keeps saying &quot;go to your favorite online dealer and just order
the WR1 kit&quot;. And they're saying this to people who are supposedly buting
the kit because they're too strapped for cash to properly repair a starter
or wiring in the first place.

So, here is my reply to those thinking of installing a WR1 kit:

The search terms &quot;relay 40 amp&quot; are your friend.

Either the 4 pin or the 5 pin will work. If buying bulk I usually buy the 5
pin because it may have more uses when I grab one from the toolbox.

The following pages show how to wire one -- and guess what, since they are
generic automotive relays the pin number markings even match up (usually).

And, for info on arcing and another potential starting problem area that
even the WR1 may not fix for long have a look here:
