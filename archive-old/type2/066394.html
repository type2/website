&gt;FM#6.....? &lt;dont get me started&gt; ;-)

ok i won't get you started but i will start a few more (real life
experiences for the most part)

FM#7.. make sure you burn the hell outta the main wiring harness in your
enthusiam to weld up those gaping holes in the frame rails

FM#8 make sure you add at least 19 separate electrical gizmo's all
requiring you mangle the wiring harness (and cut holes in the dash :).
Extra points if you do not properly ground wires and/or use masking tape
for wrapping wires

FM#9 make paint match is &quot;close enough&quot; (i.e. any old shade of green will
do, please apply withthe cruddish cheapest brush possible))

FM#10 add &quot;truck stop special&quot; outter rear view mirrors to replace those
inadequate OEM VOA &quot;elephant ears&quot; ditto for that itty bitty interior rear
view mirror. Bonus points if you use 1/2&quot; drill bit to drill holes for
securing screws.

FM#11 add car speakers with complete abandon cutting sheet metal whereever
you please to hear those &quot;kewel&quot; tunes, pay special attention to mangling
the speaker grill and those perfect condition &quot;saltnpeppa&quot; door panels ( i
have a mental picture picture of a deranged individual w/ a Sawzall)

FM#12 install at least 27 diferent car attena's over the years (dang kids
keep breaking them off). make sure that each time you install a new car
attena that you slightly enlarge the hole in the nose of the bus to which
the attenta will be attached. If you really do your work well you will
eventually have a 2&quot; plus diameter hole. Bonus points if you blob on HUGE
amounts of goop to &quot;seal'er up&quot; (note this advice pertains to all rubber
seals. Why bother treating rusty windshields when a simple blob of goop to
render the leaking windshield dry for a maximum of two weeks until rust
re-appears?)

FM#13 install spare tire carrier on front of bus, you must secure spare
tire carrier with at least 3/4&quot; bolts.



etc. etc etc.

getting ME started!
