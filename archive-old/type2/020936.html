The spring that you're looking for looks just like a heavy duty
&quot;ball-point pen&quot; spring.  It sits in a recess on the top of the
distributor drive gear in the case.  It provides a bit of upward
pre-load on the distributor shaft.  Necessary? Who knows.  But I
subscribe to Dr. Kettering's philosophy that, &quot;Parts left out cost
nothing and have an infinite service life.&quot; In other words, if it didn't
*need* to be there, it wouldn't be.

YMMV, of course.
