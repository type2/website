Oooh, ooh civil engineer here,

The first law of thermodynamics states that if you put energy into a system
you get energy out. The second law states that this is not entirely true.
Basically it talks about the efficiency of a system. One of the energies
lost in this system is the realized by heat. Heat created through the
resistance in the mechanical part and heat created in the chemical part. The
real problem is in that our system the 1700cc engine is not as efficient at
this higher level. i.e.. the higher compression. We'll we could go on all
day. To be thorough the third law says that the change in entropy is always
greater than zero. Hence the thousands of used parts we have in stock. How
in the world did you get a whole vw bus on those shelves? The third law of
TD. I say.

You left out a very important factor, that is, that you have more heat to
begin with (before detonation) created by more compression of the mixture.
If all other things were equal and you got identical energy conversion the
higher compression would leave more residual heat.

&gt;However, basic thermodynamics (Thermo I) shows
&gt;that you are converting energy into mechanical
&gt;motion. The more we convert, the less leftover
&gt;heat we have.
