&gt; I ordered a windshield seal a week ago Monday for Nikki's bay bus from
Bus
&gt; depot..it arrived on that friday in a very timely manner. The seal
installed
&gt; great and even impressed the installer. I didn't get to talk to Ron
himself
&gt; but the lady handled  my order well despite my accent ,,grin, (its a
redneck
&gt; thang). I just wanted to say great service and i will try some of Ron's
&gt; sheetmetal panels at a later date and report on them as well.
&gt; Oh btw Nikki's Bay now has a new nose skin and is done except for some
minor
&gt; crap tomorrow. Later
