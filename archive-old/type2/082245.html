Subject: it's time for Dupree to go

Hello All. Unfortunatly i have come to the parting point with my beloved 
Dupree. She's a 77 &quot;deluxe&quot; westy with a rebuilt 1700 with weber conversion 
and vaccum dizzy.. she has 77 style exhaust on her with new 4-tip exhaust 
from bus boy's on her. all the camping equipment is there including stove, 
sink, and fridge. she has new brakes all the way around including new master 
cylinder, calipers, pads, shoes, and wheel cylinders. canvas has rips in it 
but top bed is in excellent condition. she has a &quot;custom&quot; paint job on her, 
only rust is in the rear right corner and battery box. she also has brand new 
tires all the way arounnd. im mostly interested in a trade for a 71 westy in 
the same condition. im located in central VA. thanks. Fare Thee Well.
