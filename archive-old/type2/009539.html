Subject: My bus was hit while parked

The next door neighbor's, while out of town, left their son home to fend for
himself.  Part of that seemed to include his Chevy S-10 rolling backwards
down the driveway, across the street and into my '75 kombi stationwagen.
I've had it parked for a few months with a for sale sign on it.  It needs a
full rebuild for which I don't have the space/money to do this.  My Riviera
camper is my daily driver now.

When it smacked my bus it hit the driver side door at about the point of the
reflector breaking it and denting the door.  The force of the impact was
enough to push the passenger side tire against the curb, deflating the tire
and pushing the wheel up and over the curb into the plants of the neighbors
yard.

The obvious fix or repair items will be the door, reflector, tire and wheel.
The not so obvious will be the axle/beam and all of its related components.
Not to mention a perfectly straight bus is now tweaked.  What kind of
collateral costs and parts should I be considering when the neighbors
insurance company try's to low ball me.

I think they just bought my bus.

Thanks
Danny
