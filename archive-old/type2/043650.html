Greetings,

Got back last night from my first real road trip in my Bus. Drove down
I-5 from Portland to Eugene (OR) and then headed up state hwy 58 into the
Cascades to a favorite lake. The elevation is about 6000 feet and the Bus
had no complaints. We took two vehicles, the Bus hauled camping gear for
a family of six for a week, the tools and car stuff, and my grown son and
I. Everyone else was in the tired but faithful old Suburban.

I'm proud to say that the time and money I've put into the Bus paid off.
Labor Day will be our two year anniversary, and our first year was kinda
rough. Replacing cooling flaps and tin the PO thought unnecessary, spun
rod bearing, correct tires etc, but slowly my Bus has become the joy it
was intended to be.

We cruised at 65 mph on the Interstate, but I think he would have been
happy at 70. Pulling the grade he was content to cruise at 45-50 mph in
3rd. I took a box of hand tools, some oil and a set of points (always in
the Bus) and the AIRS info for Eugene (thanks, kind AIRS volunteers).

I met two other bay window owners at the campground, one with a 75 Westy
and one with a 74 Kombi he'd had since new (this Bus came with a 3-person
middle but no back seat). Neither were List members, but now they know
about it. An orange pop-top cruised through, but didn't stay.

My thanks to the community that is this list.
