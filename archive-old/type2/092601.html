Subject: UPDATE - VDO gauges, senders, etc. for sale

Update - Most of the stuff has been sold and shipped.  I still have the two 
VDO wiring kits left - these kits have all of the correct lengths and 
colors of wire to hook up a VDO oil temp or oil pressure gauge, with 
factory style connectors included.  The ends of the wires are even 
pre-stripped!  How about $15 for each kit or both for $25?

Another thing I forgot, I have two of the chrome gauge holders, the kind 
that mount at the bottom of the dashboard.  One is for a single gauge and 
one is for a pair.  These are not VDO parts but they work great for holding 
the VDO gauges.  $3 for the small one and $5 for the large one or $6 for both?

============================================================================
I have here some VDO equipment for sale.  I am selling it on behalf of our 
fellow listmember Jackson Burgess, who is by now probably on his way down 
into Baja California with his '79 Adventurewagen for some leisurely R&amp;R (I 
want his life).

This stuff was all purchased by Jackson from the Bus Depot (with 5% 
listmember discount) but for a host of reasons he decided not to install it 
and he would like to offer it to the list for a 15% discount.  I believe 
the guages are the Vision style.  All of it is BRAND NEW in the box.

Here is what I have:

When it is all sold I will be sending the money so he can buy more fish 
tacos.  Prices do not include shipping, but I will ship USPS for actual cost.
