Subject: 79 Engine

Hi all,

      I just wanted to drop a line to thank everybody who responded to all
my posts about my recent engine issues.  There were far too many to thank
everyone by name but you all know who you are.  My bus is up &amp; running &amp; I
am very happy.  I just did my first oil change at 25 miles.  There was a lot
of junk in that oil.  I will do it again at 300 &amp; 1000 miles.  Anyway,
thanks to all.  If anyone wants to see her, follow the link below.  Nothing
fancy, just a few pics of my baby.
