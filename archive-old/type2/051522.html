Subject: Re: [T2] The Campground letter from AIRS  : )

Charlie-
            Nice letter. One question to anyone with an AAA guide book (or 
any other per-
tinent guides): Does anyone - staff or camper - have the right to have a 
firearm there
at all? Might check to see if &quot;Ben Hur&quot; had a permit, in any case.
