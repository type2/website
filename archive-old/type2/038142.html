&gt;it's now leaking a bit of oil.  It never did before I took the engine
&gt;out, and I didn't do anything to the engine, I just took the fuel tank
&gt;out and changed it!  Ugh.  It does look like the oil is coming out of the
&gt;passenger side valve cover, so I'm going to put new gaskets on them.

Yes, you can do it with the engine in, although getting the bail wires back 
on is tricky with the upper tin and heat exchangers in place.  What might 
have happened is that when you removed the engine the valve cover got 
bumped on something which dislodged the gasket.  An easy fix.
