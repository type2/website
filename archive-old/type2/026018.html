Hi Chuck,

Haven't seen one personally (Not surprising, I was only recently born in
1964.) but just this past weekend I met a guy from Bell Canada at a car show
who told me about them. He said they used to place bets on which one
wouldn't make it back that night, as they were out of service something like
20-30% of the time.

At least, that's how the story goes, as it was told to me.

Happy trails,

&gt; 
&gt; Most likely a question for those of you in Ontario. Bell telephone of Canada
&gt; used VW buses for installation work sometime around 1962-63, has anyone ever
&gt; run across one of these rare beasts?
&gt; thanks all
&gt; Chuck
&gt; Vancouver is.
