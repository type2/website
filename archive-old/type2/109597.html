Subject: Re: [T2] heater cable replacement problem

&gt; I went through the same thing today. I managed to get the whole thing out
&gt; (mangled), but also managed to kink my new cable trying to feed it through
&gt; the conduit.  I also have not been able to clear whatever the block is in
&gt; the conduit.

   Why not clean the crud out by drilling out the cable housing, and fix the
problem? Take the old cable, and flatten one end by laying it on a flat hard
surface, like a vice. Then hit it with a hammer till you have a nice flat
1/4 inch wide end. Chuck the other end in a drill, and slowly feed it in the
housing while drilling, spraying with WD 40 from time to time.
    When the housing is clear, be sure and grease the new cable to prevent
it from happening again.
