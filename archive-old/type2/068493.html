Subject: Propane, 76 westy, backup

1st time e-mailer:
1) The propane tank I have lasted 3 months B,L,D and when I repainted it 
I burned off the excess propane for 4 hrs before sanding it.  The 
inspection:  I was told that those horizontal tanks are DOT certified 
and do not need to be inspected!?! I still don't understand.  
However, I cleaned it up, sanded minor pitting, primed, painted and 
had the tank refilled at a NG station and it's doin fine! - Be 
careful of the area of tank opposite the valves that has a rest plate 
welded to it.  Lots of rust / pitting underneath it

2) The 76 westy wondering about the red &amp; black wire running by the 
brake fluid - Its the power for the water pump.

3)75 auto  Back up lights - connection at shifter, use a multimeter to check 
for wire breaks from shifter to lights, there should be a fuse in the 
left of the engine compartment.  Lastly (may seem dumb) check bulbs.

4) To the new 76  owner w/ a manual- I switched my westy from an auto to 
a manual and it makes a world of difference to me!  The feeling of 
control coming down mountains alone (much less going up).  If anyone 
wants info on the auto/man switch e-mail direct.
