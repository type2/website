Stressed by poor connections?  How did you determine that?  I would argue 
that mine failed years ago by not putting out spec voltage.  The fact that 
it didn't *completely* fail is irrelevent.

&gt;Can anyone comment on a Wells unit with a long life??

Mine has been in service for a few years now.  Next question?

&gt;Beware, because NAPA sells &quot;NASCAR&quot; heavy duty points for these Bosch 
&gt;dizzies that cost $9.95. The hinge pin must be worked with a file to fit 
&gt;the hole in the plate, then the frame hits the dizzy housing, so it must 
&gt;be worked down to clear. The stock Bosch points cost $1.95 and fit perfect 
&gt;every time.

*yawn*
I thought we were talking about regulators, so I'm going to ignore your 
rant-du-jour.

&gt;You can pay less for junk or you can pay more for junk. In the long run, 
&gt;stock will save a bunch of time/money no matter the cost. In fact, only 
&gt;stock parts can rule out all together risk of throwing extra time/money at 
&gt;poor function or longevity.

To that I will simply quote what I wrote previously.  My feelings haven't 
changed.

&lt;!sarcasm&gt;
Of course, if you'd rather pay $100 for a NOS Bosch mechanical regulator so 
you can experience this joy all over again a few years from now, be my 
guest.  You can be content knowing that you applied DM (Dumme Methode) and 
are somehow superior because of it, even though your bus won't start.  :)
