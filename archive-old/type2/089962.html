&gt; &gt;Well, the sludge was caked inside the strainer cap,
&gt; &gt;not in the strainer itself.

&gt; Yeah, Sure. Whatever. Want to buy some swamp land ?
&gt; Sludge does not confine itself to the strainer cover.
&gt; It's also in the oil cooler and much grit has gone
&gt; through the bearings and left damage there.

Don't you get it? Your supposed to tell me what I _want_
to hear, make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside ;-)

&gt; Find some time ( and $$ :).

I try, but my wife and kids do a great job of spending
both. =20
