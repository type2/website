BS, I have a '73 1/2 or a '74 front seat in a '76, the seat is the
early non headrest type with the big circle handle tilt back adjustment.
I then used the frame from the origional bolstered '76 in the '78.
This is fact, the buses are within miles of my residence, could at a
whim go swap the '74 seat into the '77 or '78 or '81.  Although the
style of seat varies greatly the runners are compatible.
