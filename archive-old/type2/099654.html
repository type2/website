Subject: Re: [T2] Re: rod bearings &amp; other diff. in 75 engine

&gt;I've seen a lot more 1.7/1.8 engines in the yards with dead motors than 
&gt;2-liters.  Here's another idea - less displacement means less power so you 
&gt;have to use more throttle or rpm to go the same speed, which generates 
&gt;more heat.  Point being that there is no free lunch by going down in 
&gt;displacement.  There are many other factors to take into account.

Could it be because those engines were carbureted and did not receive the 
attention and carb adjustment they needed from time to time?

Just asking.
