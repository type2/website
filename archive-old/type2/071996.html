Subject: Re: vw screensaver URL= PC only


Just thought I'd let the Mac users know:  the screensaver URL is (I assume)
a PC only version.  It downloads as a Zip-It document, which I think is PC
only.

Correct me if I'm wrong.

Meanwhile, I'm still looking.... for the Mac version(s) of any screensavers
related to VWs.
