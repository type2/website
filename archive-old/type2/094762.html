Subject: Re: [T2] CD Player Recommendations

I installed a Jensen CD unit I picked up at Wally World -- fit the existing 
radio hole perfectly, and at 120watts it does a pretty good job of being 
heard over my very noisy bus (interior is gutted, so no sound insulation 
whatsoever). Just make sure your electrical system is up to par, otherwise 
you'll see your lights dim to the beat of the music at higher volumes.

Sean,
1970 MicroBus (&quot;Mimi&quot;)
