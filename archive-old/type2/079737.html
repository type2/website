Subject: Re: [T2] H4 Conversion kits

I think you can use H4 lamps in some states, but not has your main headlights.

I recently got into a discussion with a EuroVan owner who was under the 
impression that he could legally drive with H4 lamps in Washington state.  I 
looked into what the DOT had written about the use of H4s, and I read it as 
use of auxiliary lighting and not for use with headlamps.  It seems that some 
western states allowed the use of the H4 or H3 lamps for fog lights or 
auxiliary lighting.  These may not be legal in other states.

I've been running Hella H4s in both my '74 Westy and my '73 European panel 
and have had no problems with inspections, or getting pulled over.  I have no 
experience with the other H4 housings, but I have heard complaints that the 
reflective material will flake off on some of the cheaper plastic units.

&lt;&lt;Generally, they are not DOT legal because back then they required the

reflector to be sealed.  There were a few H4 lights that were DOT legal

because they built a glass bulb around the H4 bulb inside the light.  I

think that they were marketed under the &quot;Bobi&quot; name.&gt;&gt;
