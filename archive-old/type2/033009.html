Volks, I just returned from a 1200 mile trip (St Louis
to Okla) where I was camping at a beautiful park
outside Sulphur Okla and enjoying the warm Indian
Summer weather. while in the area I had the chance to
check out a couple of busses for sale.
the first, and by far the best, was a 66 transporter
at Earl Mann's Bug shop in Ardmore Okla. the body was
in excellent condition except for some rust on the
bottom of the drivers side rear windows. the interior
was in great shape except for the front seats. the
exterior was excellent with the original white and
green/gray color but was somewhat oxidized. it had a
new engine with approx 25k miles. the PO had provided
complete maintenance records from when the bus was
new. Earl said he wasn't sure if he would sell as is
or do the refurb to the rust areas and front seats.
you are welcome to call Earl at 580-223-6061. This
won't be a cheap bus because Earl knows his VWs and
this is a good one.
The second bus i looked at wasn't as good but info as
follows: 73 Westy with 76670 miles on original engine.
rust under windshield. interior good but front seatd
would need repair. signal and wiper assy were
partiallt removed. had air conditioning. engine seal
missing. left tail light assy missing. fold out cot
looked fair but pop top was ripped. the bus was parked
in his yard and had not been driven for some time. if
interested contact George Chandler in Wynnewood Okla
at 405-665-9910. He said he wanted $1000 and was firm
on his price. 

Take care and Keep on Truckin'
