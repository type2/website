&gt; Why? Do most of them insist that you use resistor type wires(which I
&gt; detest).  If I have an electrical charge going down a &quot;conductor&quot; why
&gt; would I want to atenuate it by using resistor type wires?  If I have a n
&gt; ignition wire, I want it to be a real &quot;wire&quot;.
&gt;

   I usta have a set of real &quot;wire&quot; wires on my Bugeye...Lotsa fun...
I could pull up next to another car at a stop light and use his radio
as an aural tach for my engine (Well, it's a Sprite so I use the term
&quot;engine&quot; loosely... ;-)
