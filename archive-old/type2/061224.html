Subject: Trailer Hitch Installation

I've finally gotten the POC &quot;performance&quot; muffler off, and a stock muffler
on, and now there is room for my brand new trailer hitch!  It's made by
Da'Lan of Shirley Massachusetts.  It's supported by a U-bolt that fits over
the engine support bar, and bolted to the bumper.
Question is, how do you get the gosh darned U-bolt over the support bar?
I've spent the last hour on my back with my fingers jammed up in there,
with no luck.  Anybody have a neat trick?
I don't want to, but if I have to I'm thinking I could support the engine
with a jack (as if I were taking it out) and then loosen the support bar.
If I have to I have to, but has anyone succeeded in installing this type of
hitch without a major procedure?

Thanks,

Jeff Brock
