Subject: Re: [T2] Upright vs. Pancake

SSgt Scott sends:

&gt; I know this discussion has taken place before, so I am not wanting to
&gt; rehash that. I called a Salvage yard and talked to a guy about a cylinder
&gt; head. This place is a VW/Audi only yard. After telling him what I wanted
&gt; (type 4 head) he promptly told me that they are all junk and that I should
&gt; put an upright Bug motor in the Bus. He offered to do the convertion for
&gt; something like $2500. I said no thanks, but then asked a few questions. I
&gt; will call him Bob also. Bob said that he did it for &quot;simplicity and
&gt; reliability&quot;. O.K., what do you do about the gap around the engine I asked.
&gt; He said&quot;nothing, It dosn't need it&quot; I asked how he keeps it cool, He said
&gt; &quot;they run over 100,000 miles and never have a problem keeping cool, air just
&gt; exits around the Bug tin&quot;. He also said he uses 1641cc P's&amp;C's for more
&gt; power. He has put them in Vanagons and Buses.

This guy wants $2500 to put the wrong motor in your Bus. You may want to ask
him when the next meeting of the John Dillinger Died For You Society is; I
know he's a member. I also know he's a crook.

There's a guy named Joe Locicero who hangs out over on RAMVA; he runs a
company just a little south of you that retrofits Type 4 engines for service
in Bugs. That's a good retrofit--life expectancy of a T4 engine is about 2x
that of a T1 engine. Sticking a Type 1 engine in a Bus or a Vanagon is
not--you'd have major, major overheating problems and a few other little
quibbles.

Itemized list of reasons I think Bob's eyes are brown:

a. The 1641cc (87mm) P&amp;C set is unreliable in a Bug--the metal in the
cylinder walls is just too thin. A Bug weighs what, 1500 pounds? A Bus (not
a Westy, not a Riviera, but just a plain old Transporter) weighs about twice
that; more weight means more power demand to drag it around means more heat.
Heat on thinner cylinder walls is a Bad Thing. More heat is a Disaster.

a1. Now if you would have said &quot;he puts 91.5mm jugs in for extra power,&quot; I
wouldn't be bitchin' so much, because the 91.5mm jug has the same wall
thickness as the 85.5. But that's not the case, so let me grouse.

a2. Ping http://www.aircooled_dot_net and look for 87mm P&amp;Cs. He doesn't have
them, and John Connolly is not shy about saying why he doesn't carry these.
I have it under good authority that John Connolly would not put an 87mm P&amp;C
set in a lawn mower.

b. That gap! The general consensus of opinion in the VW community (okay, the
part of the VW community that doesn't bandaid things by leaving off the
flaps, leaving out the thermostat, and screwing three oil coolers on just to
get the temps down) is that letting even one molecule of air escape from
your engine bay somewhere Volkswagen never intended it to is Bad. There is
probably enough space between Bug tin and Bus body to fit your whole hand
in.

c. I wonder how many of his customers get this conversion, run the engine
for a week, have it blow up and just have the car hauled off instead of
going back there and telling him in no uncertain terms to &quot;put my engine
back in and give me my money back!&quot;

&gt; Now I think that &quot;Bob&quot; is smoking some wild stuff! He just drops in a Bug
&gt; motor and runs them like that. He said the power is not bad, just a little
&gt; slower(I Bet!!!), and they do just fine. He claims that his VDO gauges say
&gt; its cooler than the pancake motor and all sorts of other stuff I did not
&gt; buy.

The people who make Slick 50 say it's great stuff. (And I can attest that
Slick 50 delivery chain oil is wonderful stuff--overpriced as hell, but
wonderful nonetheless. But delivery chains on printing presses are *not*
Volkswagen engines.) The guys who sold snake oil said it cured everything.
This guy says his engines are great in Buses. You can say anything you want.
Does it make it true? Well, no.

&gt; So whats up with this guy?? Is any of what he said true? I would never do
&gt; this on any bus I had, I want all the cooling tin at a minimum if I did, not
&gt; just the Bug tin.

Yeah, some of what he said was true. I have no doubt that he'd put a Bug
engine in your Bus. I have no doubt that there would be an inordinate gap
between the Bug tin and the Bus body. And I'm absolutely certain you'd have
to give him $2500 before he'd let you have your Bus back. The rest of it?
Well, let's just say he'd have to do a lot of proving to me before I'd
believe him. And a pancake engine is still going in my Bus.
