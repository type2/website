Subject: Re: Lower mounting studs for case

Thanks to all who sent me replies, I don't know how I missed all these
connections!! Man, BFY, CIP, Germansupply. Guess that will teach me to learn
to search better. :-)

 

Take care to all,

Here's to all the troops overseas on Rememberance Day/Veteran's Day

I think either of these should work:

&gt; Managed to snap off the lower engine case stud that

&gt; projects out the bottom

&gt; of my AH case, and bolts up to the tranny using 17mm

&gt; nuts. One of the two

&gt; big bottom ones. That leaves me with 3 to bolt the

&gt; engine into place, which

&gt; is not a good thing. Has anyone seen these for sale

&gt; anywhere? I can't seem

&gt; to locate one anywhere.
