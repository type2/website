Subject: RE: Load Range C or D

Sorry, Alex, I can't find you address to do an off-line posting.

Alex, as a standard, the load range C is rated at a certain lbs of load at a 
set 50 PSI, and the load range D is rated a certain lbs of load at 65 PSI.

This makes it easier to compare load range C of one manufacturer with load 
range C of another tire manufacturer.


And if you carry 50 PSI in your tires, it doesn't matter if you are running 
C or D load range tires; the load capacity will be the same for the same 
manufacturer and family, like Yokohama 365.


For example, if you buy and mount 8 tires, four of load range C and four of 
load range D, and PSI them at 50, run with four C and then run with four D 
load range, there will be no difference in load capacity or ride or side 
wall stiffness.


So if you don't plan to run more than 50 PSI, save the $$ and get load range 
C.

And people, remember, Alex did not want to start another FART.  It is just 
that the new system forces the people on digest to wait until we can catch 
the actual e-ail address.
