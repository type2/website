I have a 74 bus, and I was was wondering if the tab on the gas pedal that 
keeps you from pushing the pedal all the way down is necessary? I have a 
tachometer so I know I won't over rev, but I would like to be able to stay 
above 60 on a hill when I have to drive on the interstate with people going 
75 behind me. So basically I want to know if I removed this, could I give 
the engine too much gas? I am running dual kadrons if that makes a 
difference.
