Subject: Re: [T2] electrical issue?

what about the regulator and alternator? what about a fuse?
how about those battery connectors? any rust or corrosion?
tight connections(on battery cables)
for you not to have lights on the dash or anything i would say start somewheres there?
start with the fuses and work your way down a list of possibles?
sounds funny but first off you got to find the source of no power at all and then maybe find what is draining it?
do you have a radio hooked into the battery(straight wired)?
what kinds of changes have you made lately if any?
new radio /amps? new lights? anything that has moved or bumped the wires? check for cuts and skinned marks in the wires?
good luck with this ... i cant stand the electrical part of it. 
i would rather be turning wrenches anyday than messing with the wiring.
peace
chris

out of nowhere, I went to start my van (79) and it was dead. I had turned it off not a half-hour prior to that. I managed to get a jump and everything was fine until I tried to start it again...again.._dot_dead. It still had the battery that was in when I bought it so I thought that might be the issue. So I forked over the cash for a new one and hooked it up today. Now when I turn the key, nothing at all...not even warning lights. It is as if the battery is not even hooked up. I checked the connection and they all look fine. Anyone have any ideas?

thanks,
Colby
