&gt; Hi,

&gt; I have a '78 type 2 and it is squatting down in the back.
&gt;
&gt; I am told that this is due to the the torsion bar age, however, it also
has extreme camber, like about 15 degrees worth on the back end.
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps this is normal, but I do see abnormal tire wear after 20,000 KM.

The camber comes with the sag.

You can reset the bars to restore your ride height.  The Bentley has the
procedure.  Be sure _not_ to put in a little extra height, as this will
yield handling, CV and tire wear problems.  The stock specs are best.
