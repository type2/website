Subject: cranks and cylinder shims

I just split the case on my 1776 to replace the stock crankshaft with a
counterweighted one which I have yet to purchase.  I could use help with
two items:

1. After reading the recommendations on this list, I will check prices on a
Demello and a RIMCO crank.   Will these reworked cranks be compatible with
the standard main bearings which I have in my case?

2.  I was running a set of 0.040 cylinder shims to drive the compression
ration down to 7 but the engine ran very hot.  To reduce heat generation, I
bought a set of 0.060 cylinder shims from RMMW.  I just looked at them and
found that they are truly ugly pieces of metal.  They are obviously stamped
out.  Their surfaces are not at all smooth. On one, there is a piece of
metal that has been rolled over during the stamping so that it sticks out
of the plane of the shim.  The only oil leak I had with my previous rebuild
came from the joint between #4 cylinder and the case,  an area which
included one of the 040 shims.  I can bet that if I install these 060s, I
will have serious oil leaks.   My question is can I do better than this?
Do any vendors sell shims that are machined and or polished?

Thanks, Jack
