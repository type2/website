&gt;  Another list member addressed the fact that Bus Depot takes a long time

I never said that they take a long time to ship

&gt; to ship, and made the comment that he'd pay the extra couple of dollars
&gt; for 2-day delivery.  With all due respect, I don't think that list
&gt; member
&gt; ever tried that approach with the Bus Depot.  I tried about 4 weeks ago,

I do this frequently with the Bus Depot, and I do pay the extra couple
bucks.

&gt; and there is a very expensive charge to get things shipped in 2

depends,  $15 dollars is not that expensive when you &quot;NEED&quot; the part
yesterday

&gt; a matter of fact, paying this big charge only gets your order moved up
&gt; the queue.  Instead of shipping out in a week's time, it will ship out
&gt; about 2-3 days, then come to you via 2-day shipping.  Sure, you'll get
&gt; your order much faster than the normal way, but if I pay alot for 2-day
&gt; shipping, I want to get my stuff in 2 or 3 days.

I always got 2 days or less when I paid for it (assuming it was in stock)
and I ask when I place the order
&gt; 
&gt; One final complaint.  In buying stuff to fix or restore my bus, I kind of take the &quot;squirrel&quot; approach, whereas I gather my stuff over periods of months, sometimes a year.  Well, about a year ago I ordered a sealed ball-bearing unit for the sliding door track's vertical wheel from Bus Depot.  I tried installing it about 5-6 weeks ago, and it didn't fit.  This thing cost me almost $50.  I called Bus Depot to see if I could exchange this thing for store credit, and the customer service guy went on the computer and saw all my other orders except this one.  Of course, I didn't have the invoice for it, and maybe a year is too long to expect a business to exchange a part, but I've had other vendors do it.  

don't we all do that??,  gotta garage full of stuff for my bus (or
someone elses')
&gt; 
&gt;  Bottom line for me?  If you don't need it fast, call Bus Depot
&gt; directly, not their order hotline, and ask specifically if the parts you

yeah the 800 number is worthless
