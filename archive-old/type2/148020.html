&gt;Cool tools, but you have to have an O2 sensor bung in the first 3 feet or
&gt;so of your exhaust, preferably someplace where the cylinders' exhaust is

The wide band sensors are heated and can go anywhere on the muffler inlet side of VW exhaust system. Although it's probably too hot at the exhaust port there's on way to mount one there anyway.

- Any of the header pipes of a 72-74/79 exhaust is fine but you'll only get a reading from one cylinder (good enough in my opinion unless you suffer a head failure)

- On the 75-78 exhaust the u-bend &quot;afterburner&quot; pipe is a good spot but again you only end up measure half the cylinders. This was the compromise I made on my bus:

- If you have the original and complicated 75-78 setup you can use a catalytic converter with the built-in bung:

I like this solution because it helps to clean the air but it makes it's harder to route the cable.
