Subject: Westfalia table
To: TYPE2_at_TYPE2.COM

Hello,
I have a 1973 westfalia with a sink and ice box unit.
The table that folds down next to the sliding door is
missing. If that is not an accurate enough
description, when down, it covers up the spice
cabinet. When up, it blocks the door from closing. I
will also need the support leg (hinges would also be
nice). If anyone has any info, it is appreciated.
                              Thanks,
                              Paul Deatherage

'73 Westfalia
