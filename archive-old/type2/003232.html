Subject: home again.. 

Well... we made the long trip to Uvalde, Texas and back... had a very
enjoyable time... Had planned on stopping by to see Art (on the airs list
for Texas) but, sorry Art.... it was 5am on Saturday morning when we came by
your area and thought it best not to call.. lol.....
We did travel on down to Del Rio, Texas and crossed over into Mexico... had
a good time there and no problems, have never crossed the border before, was
quite fun... figured we might be searched but... wasn't.....
After Mexico, we then went back to Uvlade and the next morning (sunday)
headed to Hondo, Texas and up to Fredricksburg, then on to Austin, where we
spent the night making a few clubs there, and then on home Monday afternoon.
Monday is when we started having problems with the engine, it had been using
a little oil, thought it was mainly from a small leak though, and we had
started getting a weird noise.  Well, my husband figured out, when it would
not run but for only a few seconds, and then was very weak with pressing all
the way to the floor with the accellerator made no difference... that the
engine had &quot;stacked&quot; the bearings.  Thanks to &quot;Duralube&quot; it did start
running fairly decently and we did make it home.  Was about an 11 hour
drive, not turning the engine off the whole time, but was able to drive the
posted speed limit. Now, we are looking at a fairly expensive rebuild.  But,
at least &quot;fiasco&quot; got us home safe and sound.
