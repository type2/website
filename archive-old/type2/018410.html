The problem was indeed the shift rod coupler. I bought a new one for $12.95
at the  FL(VW)APS. The cheap (Brazilian) sheet metal screw stripped during
installation--it took me a half hour of endless wrench-twisting before the
little light bulb over my head went on.

I would have discovered this sooner if I'd inserted the screw from the left
(passenger side) of the coupler where there is enough room to place a small
ratchet &amp; socket on the end of the screw. As it was, I inserted the screw
&gt;from the right side and used an end wrench, twisting about 10-15 degrees at
a time and simply thought that I had a long way to go...

Fortunately I kept the old sheet metal screw &amp; retainer and used those after
learning that the new ones were stripped. Now my shifting is extra-crispy!
