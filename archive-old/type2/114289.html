Subject: Re: [T2] German hubcaps

The Vanagon hubcap superceded the original Type 3 hubcap, at least as 
far as VW is concerned.  The Vanagon part fits on the Beetle/Bus/Type 3 
wheel, but it projects almost twice as far.  Maybe Joe Blow wouldn't 
notice the difference, but I sure would.

&gt;&gt; One thing is a bit weird though. The partnr on the screen is:
&gt;&gt;   311 601 151 D
&gt;&gt; That's the number for the original hubcab. But the title of the 
&gt;&gt; webpage is &quot;Hubcap 251601151A&quot;...and that is the partnr for the 
&gt;&gt; Vanagon and 1980ties Beetles hubcab.
