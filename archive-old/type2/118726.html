Subject: Re: [T2] Drum brake star adjuster

Guys sorry for the lack of information the piece I mean is the star adjuster
holders that are bolted to the backing plate, I took the bolts off but the
piece does not move at all, since the stoppers of the stars are bend (small
piece of metal sheet, that prevent the stars to move from the position and
keep the brakes adjust) I would like to service them because I can find them
here where I am.
By the way thanks for the fast response

Roberto
