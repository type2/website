Volks,

As many of you will remember, Kristen Ann Laurite was travelling alone across
the United States in her 1971 bus and was murdered at a rest area on I-40 in
Arkansas in August of 2000.  That murder is still unsolved but I saw an
article on the CNN web site today that sparked my interest...

See this article:
http://www.cnn_dot_com/2004/US/02/27/possible.serial.killer/index.html

As I read it, I was reminded of the murder of Kristen Laurite, which remains
unsolved.  Altho there are definite differences, there are also similarities.
I have the name and number of the prinicapal investigator at the time and
intend to call him in an hour or two but don't want to be the 40th to do so
(actually I am not sure if that might  not be a good thing, but...)

Any comment?

Steve Dolan
