Subject: Pictures from the Detroit Event

Volks, I have made a simple index page with pictures I took up in
Detroit... See your fellow list members!  Tell me their names!  Remind me
who the heck I met! :-)

Go to: http://www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/detroit/

I know that it was one fine event and that I met a ton of nice people,
high on the lsit being Chris Huff, Ted Finesman, Denis Jollife (thank you
again for the curtain, Denis!!!), Isaiah Hanbeck, John Hartranft, and a
ton of others.  The booth for the Hubcap tour was beautiful! (pictures on
the site)
