Subject: Re: [T2] `77 locking gas cap

&gt; I'm ready to order that new-style locking gas cap (with the &quot;normal&quot; looking
&gt; keys).  Any suggestions as to whom to send my money to, i.e. who still has
&gt; them in stock/best price, etc.?  Preferably someone on the east coast,
&gt; simply to keep shipping and time delay down.  I'd like to get the money on
&gt; it's way on Wednesday (9th).
&gt; 
&gt; Ron?  Got cap?

Yep, BD if they have 'em.
