Subject: Re: [T2] Wandering Westy

Who did the alignment?  That's what I would suspect.  Steering box would get very loose and then start popping.  At least mine did.  Cheers....KR

swing lever bushings, ball joints, tie rods, draglink, Hankook RA08 tires, front end alignmnent
etc.).  The Bus still seems to have a nice wander to it, enough to make it annoying to drive.  I
contantly have to correct the wheel to keep going straight, and even a light (10 mph) crosswind
seems to really throw the Bus around.

The only piece I haven't yet replaced is the steering box.  Is there a definitive way to tell if
one is worn out?  Bentley doesn't say much.  I don't feel much play at the steering wheel (1&quot;-2&quot;),
and the front wheels seem to move when turning the steering wheel.

If it does need to be replaced, Bus Boys has their 15% sale going on right now; are there any
opinions on a good (or bad) place to get a rebuilt steering box for a '69?
