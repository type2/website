&lt;&lt; Shock recommendation? Anything to stay away from? &gt;&gt;

My bus came to me with white colored &quot;KYB&quot; shocks on it in almost new 
condition.  They work OK, but they are just too stiff for my liking. 

I will probably replace them with a stock shock (Boge?) that is valved 
specifically for the bus.
