At idle, yes. There are a lot of web pages out there that explain how vacuum
can be used to diagnose engine state. Observing the gauge while the engine
is running...

Most of them are geared to V8s and you'll think you engine is not right if
you look at their numbers too closely. 22&quot; is not normal vacuum for a VW.
