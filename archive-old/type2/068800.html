        Yes, the refs are VERY knowlegable- they re-arranged
the FI vaccum hoses on my 77 Rabbit for me once, gratis. Once you
hit the ref station you have to play it very straight, which I
normally do anyway.

        Thom, offline if you wish, let me know what kind of car
your XSO was driving and what the problem was, if you would.
