Subject: Re: [T2]age old question(OIL)

HELLO gUYS   Heres a different topic   the oil we get now doesnt have any 
zinc in it and will cause the cam and lifters to go bad quick if you dont use any 
cam,lifter grease when putting together a new motor.  Now Penzoil does make a 
25w50 oil that does have the zinc in it just for break in oil or racing duty. 
 This is the oil that Roush racing of Nascar uses breaking in their motors. I 
personaly use the cam lube knowing that the break in ofg cam and lifters is 
very important but got to wondering if everybody did that or not.  Later and 
have fun  Mark dearing
