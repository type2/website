Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for Alternator Conversion Kit for 71 Westy



&gt;
&gt;I'd love to create some radio transmitter that would overcome the stereo in
&gt;the next thumper car that came along and help them appear to tell the world
&gt;all their inner secrets at top volume. Some sort of Buck Rogers transmitter
&gt;ray gun...


	They do make one!  It's called a bullhorn!  Pick an oldies station and aim 
that sucker right at the guy in the lowrider(not that there's anything WRONG 
with that) next to you, and try to lull him into a state of bliss...  ;^)

	Eron Crites
