Subject: RE: [T2] New to This, Need some Advice

Stephanie,

With a basic set of metric tools those things you mentioned are pretty easy
to do yourself. You might need some help adjusting the toe-in on the front
wheels after the replacement of the tie rod ends. Of course doing it
yourself is part of the fun and also an education. I'm relatively new to
working on VWs too. I did brake shoe replacement and the like back in high
school but it's been within the last year that I rebuilt a dune buggy and
discovered how simple and well designed VWs are. Once you become familiar
with them they are rather enjoyable to work on yourself. Major engine work,
timing and tune-ups your might want to leave to the pro mechanics but
otherwise jump in. You have one GREAT resource right here in this list and
the fine volks who frequent it. Do you have any friends into VWs and a
friendly VW shop nearby to get parts and advice from?

&gt;Here's what wasn't done that they said needed to be: Tie Rod Ends, 
&gt;Outer Axle Boot - right rear, front brake pads, front shocks, rear 
&gt;brake adjusters and screws.  Oh and the replacing of the carbs (they 
&gt;said it wasn't imperative at this moment but that I should really think 
&gt;about it).
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;. . . should I even
&gt;bother trying to get up the gumption to this by myself (with some of 
&gt;those more mechanically inclined individuals) or should I just suck it 
&gt;up and pay the mechanics?
