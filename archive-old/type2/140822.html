Subject: Re: [T2] Window latch for side vent window behind jalousie 
  window

From Courtney:

Unfortunately, it was the shaft that broke. :-( If I'd have seen a roll pin,
I'd have realized what I was up against. RATS! I understand the frames are made of unobtanium. How does the
frame come out BTW? Perhaps I'll be jury rigging something for now.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

To replace the vent window:

1) find a good, nice one with no rust. [shhh, I have one.....]

2) get a new seal for the big glass

3) remove big glass

4) pull vent window back about 1&quot;, tilt vent window out of opening

5) admire rust in window body opening at bottom ;(

6) install new-to-you vent window

7) install big glass back in

8) give up looking for a nice vent window and get a one-piece right side rear side window, the larger seal,
and put it in the left side.
