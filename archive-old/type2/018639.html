Rob:

Jim Sherwood's Old Volks Home web pages used to show those parts, but I
don't know if they showed the original VW part numbers.

In any event, I don't think they're available as repro parts.  I think
the only way to find 'em is to get real lucky and find someone who's got
NOS, or else out of a salvage yard.  I think Jim used to show their
availability used.

His web site's been moved, but as far as I know he's still in business,
although I think someone said that he's touring the country at the
moment.

Jim's e-mail address is: jim96003_at_c-zone_dot_net

I'm sure someone else on the list will have a better idea than I how to
contact him.
