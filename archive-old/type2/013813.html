Subject: Fuel and Starting questions
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello agin, I have some fuel line questions, 1. Can I
&gt; buy replacemnt ruber hoses for my fuel lines and the
&gt; rubber  parts in between the fuel rails on my fuel
&gt; injected 81 Vanagon at the local parts store., 2 I
suspect that my wireing or
&gt; control for my fuel pump is shot with the Key on and
&gt; in ther start positution I have no fuel pressures,
so
&gt; I diconected the wires to the pump and temporaly hot
&gt; wired it to the battery the pump work fine UI
checked
&gt; buy taking the pressure bolt out of the line and
&gt; hocked it up, spray gas all over the place. Is it
safe
&gt; for me to Hook it up to the hot line in the &quot;on&quot;
positution on the inition switch to bye pass the
normal wiring for the fuel pump.&gt; 3. I am also not
getting the engin to fire, could all
&gt; 4 fuel injectors could be cloged I changed the fuel
&gt; filter today and took it apart and it was full of
&gt; sludge. Ive held the coil wire in one hand and
triped
&gt; the points on the disturater and got a pretty good
&gt; shock.  I cant figure it out Can some one help me.
