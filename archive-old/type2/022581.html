&gt;  I've got a '76 Bus and have been gradually repairing and replacing items 
&gt; to
&gt;  improve the handling in cross winds.  I've replaced the tires with new
&gt;  Yokohamas and installed new ball joints, tie rods, and a few other
&gt;  suspension bits.  This has improved the handling quite a bit.
&gt;  
&gt;  However, on really windy days with gusts over 30 mph, the bus is still a
&gt;  handful at highway speeds.  I was contemplating adding sway bars and
&gt;  aftermarket shocks.  Has anyone else found this to be helpful with cross
&gt;  wind handling?  How difficult is the installation of each?

Hi Todd,

I've driven busses with 4, 6 and 8 ply tyres; with and without spoilers, with 
and with out heavy duty front and rear roll bars a bus with 150000miles on 
the clock and a bus with 26Km on the clock.

The single thing that made the MOST difference was 8 ply tyres.
The next thing was the spoiler kit.
the heavy duty roll bars were great for cornering didn't seem to make much 
difference for cross winds. - NB do not fit a heavy duty REAR roll bar unless 
you have a heavy duty FRONT bar.

Spoiler kits and roll bars are easy to fit; but a set of 5 8 ply 184/R14 
tyres are cheeper than a colour matched spoiler kit.

This is assuming that the steering system has no slack in it - i.e. no bad 
tie rod ends, slack steering box, or serious corrosion on idler pin housing.
Here in UK for our annual test (MOT) we are allowed around two / three inches 
of free play in the steering wheel while the vehicle is stationary. More than 
this and the vehicle cannot be driven on the road. Free play will let your 
wheels move relative to the bus in a cross wind before you can resist it.

Good luck
