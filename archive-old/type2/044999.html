Thanks to &quot;No Quarter&quot;, you can view his e-version of the postal event flyer
for more info on this upcoming weekend's &quot;Busses Nowhere Near The Arch #16&quot;.
The response has been huge, we should be buried in Type 2's
 on Friday evening.  The flyer briefly explains the event, and Erin has
provided a link to the proper &quot;Mapquest&quot; regional map for the event.
