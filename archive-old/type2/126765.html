Subject: 71 Westy (no engine) for sale, albany, ny

It's time to let it go...

I through a rod in it last year and my time is now in bikes.

White, original inside, all equipment.
Most parts for engine excluding block, jugs, pistons. 
Has German heads, coil, carb, most tin, engine adapter, tranny is good, 
brakes fine, seats ok.

Rust at all the usual places but steering is firm, sliding door works. 

Call for more info, make me a reasonable offer and it's yours.

Thanks, Andy 518-462-3372
