Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS - Clutch went out near SF!

Hey Everyone!
I am about to lower the engine and find out what's up.  My
Mom's been checking the email for me while my dad and I
are unscrewing everything.  My mom's going to take some
pictures as well.  When I post up my trip log for this
day, I will be sure to include all the excitement.  I'm
*really* curious what went wrong, however, I'm too hungry,
so I had to stop and take a break before we take the
engine out.

I'll keep you all posted!!

thanks for all the help with suppliers so far!
Mike
