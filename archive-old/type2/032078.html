&gt; I have a question for the list.  I have a chance to purchase a '72
&gt; Westy. Currently it is not running...The condition is pretty bad.....
&gt; the front is completely rusty, not eaten through, but bad rusty.....
&gt; and there are spots of rust all over the body... sitting on 4 flat
&gt; tires so could not get underneath to see the condition there.. I can
&gt; only imagine from the rest.  Insides are fair, no canvas, but does
&gt; have the upper cot.

Yuk! Gail, With all due respect, I wouldn't buy that one at any price.

1- 1972 is the first year of pancake engine with dual carbs and smog
equipment. There are throttle linkage parts that are no longer available
from any source.  Smogging it, esp. in CA, could be tough. Dual carbs are
a lot of work to synchronize and keep in tune, though some folks (esp.
high performance types) seem to like 'em OK.

2- Bad rust all over. This is very expensive to repair. Look for something
with a cleaner body or you're just going to pour huge amounts of money
into a rusty hole in the road.

3- No tires, no canvas, interior only fair, this all adds up to a lot of
expensive and time consuming stuff for you to fix.

Surfer Bob says, shop around and find a better bus to adopt! This one'll
bankrupt you and break your heart. It's already got 2 feet in the grave.

Find yourself a nice '71, or '78 with little rust and more going for it
than this one.

Happy hunting,
Surfer Bob
