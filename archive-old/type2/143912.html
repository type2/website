&gt; That sounds fine.  I doubt the threads are worn out because most likely
&gt; they haven't been turned more than a few times in the lifetime of the bus.

&gt; Plus, when you open it, you only open it enough to let the fluid out.
&gt; Whether it comes out through the threads or through the nipple, it
&gt; doesn't really matter - the fluid's coming out and that's what you want.
&gt;   You just want to make dang sure that there is no fluid coming out
&gt; while it's tight!!

The problem is that he is pressure-bleeding from the wheel end!  For
conventional &quot;pump the pedal&quot; bleeding the threads seal fine, but if
you're putting pressure on the system from the bleeder end the pressure
will push fluid past the threads.
