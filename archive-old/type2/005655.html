Check the pulleys for any burrs or roughness on the surfaces where the belt
rides.  It's fairly easy to ding up a pulley when a wrench slips or a tool
gets dropped.  It doesn't take much of a defect to eat belts alive.

A well worn pulley that's operated a bit misaligned for a long time can wear
a sharp edge on the rim - sharp enough to cut your fingers like a knife.  If
the pulley alignment is disturbed, and a new belt installed, this sharp
flange can destroy belts.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Pulleys not aligned fore-and-aft? If the belt slots on the two pulleys
aren't exactly in line with one another, the belt runs at an angle and this
kind of wear happens.  &lt;&lt;
