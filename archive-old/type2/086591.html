Subject: Re: [T2] more 79 cali distributor


My stock 78 fed dist doesn't have the retard either, but it's sitting in a
toolbox and the 79 CA is on the van without the retard connected.

My questions are should the 79 CA dist be timed the same as the 78 fed dist
when the retard is not connected,
and should I disobey my mechanic and connect it and retime it?

Jeff,

My 78 stock fed original does not have retard on the dist.

I'm pretty sure that it is timed at about 7.5 degrees and does *not* have
an egr.

Jeff, I think my total advance is about 40+ degrees...

Hope that helps, dave

&gt; OK more opinions requested here. To recap, 78 2L rebuilt with about 15K
on
&gt; it, stock FI, 140psi comp all around. I upgraded to a 79 Calif
distributor
&gt; electronic ignition setup. The coil is still the Bosch Blue but will be
&gt; replaced with a electronic ignition coil (what years Rabbit and Audi are
&gt; correct?).
&gt;
&gt; The question is timing. My mechanic had me connect the vac advance and
cap
&gt; the retard. He then timed it to 8 BTDC at idle. It runs great.
&gt;
&gt; He said I didn't need the retard. When I pressed him on it he pointed out
&gt; that I didn't have my EGR connected and I had a 78 engine, cam and FI
&gt; brain. I shouldn't connect the retard with a setup like that since things
&gt; were different on the 79 Calif FI brain. A recent thread said that this
&gt; timing is pretty close when your not using the retard, tho I think it's a
&gt; little retarded. The correct timing with the retard vac connected is 5
&gt; ATDC. I haven't checked what my total advance is at 3600RPM, the specs
say
&gt; it should be 21-25 with this distributor.
&gt;
&gt; Opinions? I don't have all the parts for the EGR which I really should
get
&gt; hooked up since it cools the engine, but is the 78 Fed engine/FI
different
&gt; enough from the 79 CA engine/FI that I should NOT connect the retard
&gt; vaccuum and reset the time to correct specs?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt;
