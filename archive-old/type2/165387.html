&gt; They had _better_ be interested.  VW is moribund in the US and they  
&gt; need
&gt; something to bring people into the showrooms.

I read they lost $3B over the last two years and are moving the  
corporate office to the DC area.

&gt; I'd like to see a utility version, but I have a feeling that a bus- 
&gt; sized
&gt; vehicle would demand a larger engine.

Those crazy Cherman engineers might just put a 1.4L in it instead of  
the basic 1.2L!!! :-)

PS. I heard the chicken tax has a chance of being reduced or repealed  
to favor truck imports from Thailand as part of a free trade  
agreement. That could be cool.
