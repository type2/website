Subject: Re: [T2] Power steering on an early bus

&gt;You need to examine how the smog pump was attached on the 70s buses and 
&gt;modify these mounts to fit your power steering. One fellow I spoke with 
&gt;one time had mounted an a/c compressor on top of the Type IV shroud and 
&gt;suffered stress cracks fairly quickly.

That was me.  The compressor is hanging in there after two years.  I looked 
at the crack the other day and now I'm not so sure it's a crack anymore - 
it may just be a flaw in the surface of the fan housing.  In any case, I 
did not mount the compressor very well, and someone who is better at 
fabricating brackets could make a brace for it that I'm sure would prevent 
cracks from developing.

&gt;Also - take a look at the electric assist systems used on some of the 
&gt;hybrid cars now.

In particular you might check out the electric power steering pump from the 
MR-2.  Only problem is that it draws a substantial amount of current - 
something like 15 amps, constantly.  That may or may not be a problem 
depending on the alternator in the bus and the other electrical 
loads.  Personally I haven't had problems with my rebuilt Bosch 55 amp 
alternator and an additional 15 amp load from the A/C although it does 
worry me somewhat and I try to lessen other electrical loads when the A/C 
is on.

&gt;Hope I sparked some ideas. I don't have a perfect solution but these are 
&gt;the areas I would investigate.

Great ideas Chris!  Where there's a will, there's a way right?  One way 
might also be to consider a Vanagon.  Don't some of them have power steering?
