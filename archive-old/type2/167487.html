crappy running all the time, no run at power...have replaced coil with the
one I took out (Known working) when I put in the Crane high power ignition

&gt; Other possibilities include fuel pressure, but you've already ruled
&gt; that out. Maybe the regulator has gone bad, and/or the decel valve

the fuel presure curve looks like it came from Bentley it is that dead on.

Don't know what a compression check would show, it is very erratic. will
try new wires and I have a decel valve and will replace that this
afternoon.

the mystery

this came on while driving back from Everybus, left Everybus with normal
power and speed, could easily cruise at 65mph on I-85 but slowly it felt
like I was driving up hill all the way, by the time I hit Richmond it
would barely do 50 downhill....and when I got to the Potomac river bridge
I barely got over it. called it a day and got towed in from the Maryland
welcome center.

have so far.
changed transmission (other reasons, 1st was slipping)

. changed out the Crane for the old points
. fuel presure guage everything is dead on
. swapped out coil
............. AFM
............. Brain box
............. most vacuum lines
............. dist cap and rotor

and a bunch of other stuff, I forget now.

will swap out the resistor pack and the decel valve this afternoon. but I
am running out of ideas... will also check plugs and compression, not sure
if I have another set of wires..

thanks
Bob
