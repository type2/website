&gt; &quot;The easiest way to know if your engine suffers from overcooled oil is a
milky
&gt; white residue that forms in the breather hoses, and under the oil cap,
this is
&gt; condensation.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; I didn't realize that this was from condensation. I think I need to check
my
&gt; thermostat, maybe advance my timing a little more...

   Wait! Before you adjust your timing and t-stat, how far are you driving
each time before shuting down the engine. Short trips can also cause this
residue because the engine isn't getting fully warmed up. Depending on your
outside temps it can take up to 15 minutes of hwy driving to get the oil hot
enough to evaporate all of the moisture in it. If you advance the timing you
may be doing more harm than good.
