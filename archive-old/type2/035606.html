Subject: List members webpage. :)

Hey All,
I had Monday off work so this is what happened.
http://people.ce.mediaone_dot_net/snapcase/listrides.htm
    From the over 6,000 list posts in my deleted folder I found some
homepages and pics of list members Bus's. I put them all on one page so we
can all see each others pride and joy. I know I missed a few (there has to
be more then the twenty or so I found..) and there are about three that I
couldnt get into the right formatt for some reason... If ANYONE has a pic of
them and thier bus send it in! I would love to get more pics of members
standing next to thier bus.... up to you. Ill keep working on it and am
waiting for those pics and links! (I couldnt find a pic of &quot;Stella&quot; although
I know I had it somewhere...!!)
    Hopefully all the links work, I just went through them to be sure. If
there is a pic of your bus that you feel is un-flattering lemme know or give
me a new one. Some sites had a few buses on them so I just picked one. DONT
BE SHY! Also if someone wants thier bus and homepage taken down lemme know.
Take care all!!
Have a great day1
Steve
