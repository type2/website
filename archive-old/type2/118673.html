Subject: Re:Rubber Mats and the logic thereof

A good question, Seann. I just pulled mine off because I got a new set of
rubber and there was no rust on the uncovered painted surface. It looks like
the adhesive was not applied over every square inch of rubber. In fact many
places looked like it was applied in almost a spotted pattern. Maybe they
figured that by not glueing it everywhere enough circulation would be
provided. Now here is my question. What would be a good adhesive to use for
this?
