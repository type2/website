Dear Volks,

I want to thank Art Long once again and all the others who worked hard to 
make JRMBBC a success.  I've posted my favorite photos at my website.  You 
can find them at http://agreathomebusiness.homestead_dot_com/JRMBBC1 and JRMBBC2. 
 I think the rear view mirror shot and the pictures at the Sonic are 
especially cool.  It took some coordinating and some friendly cooperation 
from some of the other patrons at the Sonic in Ardmore.  The photos show all 
the buses lined up, from the front and the back.  For the info of folks in 
others parts of the country, Sonic is an Oklahoma based drive-in chain 
located mostly in the mid-west.  We were trying to do something like the 
dying breed poster shot.  Not quite so artsy, but still pretty cool.

Now wild fires are raging in the Arbuckle Wilderness, just a few miles away 
from Turner Falls, the site of the campout.  Let hope it rains soon here in 
Texas and in Oklahoma.  We haven't had any since mid-June.
