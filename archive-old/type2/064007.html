Subject: MANASAS BUG Out List Members Going?

I know I'm a little premature on this one but I'm going to be in San Diego on
business next week and would like to meet up with as many list
members as I can.  If there are members who are going we should try to
tie up or caravan down there.  I'm in Annapolis and it is a holiday
weekend so I would  definately consider camping.  Also as Paul Wies
has pointed out that the Dave Matthews Band is playing 10 minutes
away that Sunday night. There is a campground 2 minutes from Nissan
Paviliion where I have camped before. In addition this Friday at 10:35
eastern time on TBS they are showing Fast Times at Ridgemont High. 
Spicolli drove a bus, plus its a classic.
