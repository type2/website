&gt;We got in a debate trying to determine if we actually have to remove the
&gt;engine to swap out the Transmission.  All the books tell you to remove the
&gt;engine, but from the outside it looks like maybe possible to do it without
&gt;having to deal with engine.  (call me either lazy or optimistic - but I've
&gt;taken that engine out too many times already)

I'd drop the engine and tranny together.  Without being bolted to the 
tranny, the engine is only held in by the two rubber rear mounts that of 
course are not centered on the engine.  You could support the front of the 
engine I guess, but one slip and you will tear those rubber mounts right in 
half.  I would bet that you could drop the engine and tranny together 
faster than dropping the tranny alone.  The hardest way of all would be to 
first remove the engine, then the tranny.  Don't do it that way.
