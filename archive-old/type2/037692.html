Wes,

I remember reading a funny story on &quot;The Turbo Bus&quot; many moons ago. The
bottom line was that the driver just made do with a slooooww bus until a
friend noticed that the carb wasn't opening all the way when the gas pedal
was floored. You might check.

&gt; started having big probs getting it to go more than 30 mph with it floored
&gt; in 3rd gear-- wouldn't go faster.
