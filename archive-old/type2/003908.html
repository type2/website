Subject: Electric motor in a bus - a reference for those interested

&gt;By all means send him my e-mail address, I am rebuilding the bus this
&gt;winter for the third time. It will continue to run the roads!!
&gt;yours, topher


Topher is Topher Waring, a middle school shop teacher in VT who I contacted
perhaps a year ago after reading about him in a National Geographic World
(NG for kids).  He has a 71 that he's converted to all electric power and
his schoolkids have to reinstall the whole works every year as part of their
work:  motor, batteries, disconnects, etc.  It's a great story, and he does
it on a school budget shoestring.  The kids cut their own adaptor plate out
of plate aluminum.  It functions as a bus (imagine, a bus as a real bus) and
errand runner for the school.

He's given his permission to be thrown into our soup (I hope he meant that
by the note above).  I don't have a record of who was asking for electric
motor information, but there were several.  So email him personally, as far
as I know he isn't a listee.  He is tymzdork_at_sover_dot_net . Good luck to all.
I'd like to do it myself some day.
