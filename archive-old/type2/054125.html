Subject: 72 squareback engine in a 72 bus?

The time has come for me to do the right thing and tear our the
converted 77 FI engine and replace it with a 72 engine. I have been
looking around for awhile and have found a 72 squareback, smashed up
with a great engine. So, is engine identical to the 72 engines inType
IIs? They are both TypeIV engines, right?

TIA
