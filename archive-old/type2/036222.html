Subject: Volksworld Magazine and my Baja site

Hi All,

This is for the guys in the UK.  I've heard on the grapevine we call the
internet that my Baja Bus site was listed in the March 2000 issue of
Volksworld, If anyone has it (I can't get it here in Australia) could they
Pmail me and let me know the details so I can decide if it's worth the
trouble of geting someone from the UK to mail me the mag or not.  Errrrm,
and if it is worth it anyone one prepared to send it on over, I'll organise
some way to cover all the costs of course.

Cheers
Steve
