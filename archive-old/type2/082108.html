Subject: Christening the bus

Well, I just finished my first 200+ mile trip in the bus: Atlanta, GA to
just south of Ocala, FL.The bus did pretty good except for one small mishap.

I was stopped at a rest area about an
hour out of Macon. The bus wouldn't start. My electric fuel pump was
pumping. The dash lightsdimmed when I tried to crank. But I got nothing out of the starter. I
tried hotwiring, got a jumpfrom someone, nothing. I even rolled backwards - as far as I could - to
try to start it with theclutch - but couldn't gain enough speed. Being an unusually hot April day,
I didn't want to tryto drum up the help to push the bus forward.

So I ended up crawling under the bus and
shorting the starter with a screwdriver. It started whirring. I jumped
back in the cab and shestarted right up. I didn't have any more problems the rest of the trip.

But back to the
christening... While I was trying to get the bus started, a guy pulled up
in 1994 (or so)Porsche 911 Speedster - guards red. I'm not a big fan of Guards Red but I
love the lines of theSpeedster. I would die for an early-89 Speedster (when they still had the
3.2l engine andsimpler electronics and suspension). Unfortunately the guy took off while
I was under thebus shorting the starter. Ironically, about six months ago I was at the
same rest stop pushstarting my '86 911 ;)

As I got back in the bus I started day-dreaming about my 911 and how
much I loved her. Then I felt really guilty because I really wasn't giving
the bus credit.Sure, it's not a high-performance sports car - but it's ALOT more
comfortable to sleep in! Thenit occured to me, I'll name the bus 'Portia' from Shakespeare's &quot;Merchant
of Venice&quot;.
