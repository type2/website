Looking for simple, and cheap - we want to be outdoors and cook out with the
exception of a breakfast.

Any suggestions or warnings?

Thanks!

Chris, these skillet frozen bags that contain everything including the meat
are really great.  We have used them on a couple campouts this year and they
make a nice meal with just one skillet.  There are all kinds, some are even
better put in a flour tortilla.  Through a few in the cooler frozen along
with your other stuff, don't forget a skillet and cookstove and you're set.

We have also switched from bacon to thick sliced ham because of the mess
bacon makes.  You can use ham for many different types of meals, egg ham and
cheese breakfast sandwiches, ham cheese and flour tortilla toasted in a
skillet, ham and pancakes, ham and fried rice, you get the point.
