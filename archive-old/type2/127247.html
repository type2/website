&gt; Hi, I was sent this link to a fox powered bus and was hoping someone on the
&gt; list knew who the owner was.

All I could think of when reading this was...

I thought OEM was a hamster and the upgrade was to a gerbil... I'd never
thought to go the full fox!  Probably get to 150 kph with that!

                             OOK!
