Subject: Fwd: Re: [T2] Battery cable, starter relay.

 
post #1

I found the perfect answer, it was a Bosch WR1 Low Voltage Relay Kit.
It cost less than fifteen Dollars. This reduces the amount of voltage required to run the starter to around 7 volts. It was easy to install and all my starting problems went away.


post #2

The way I understood it was that the starter always requires 12 volts and ALOT of current - regardless of which relay kit we use...

correct, and to add to that, cutting your voltage in half would double the amperage required to perform the function intended, which would heat up your wiring and since I don't know what a starter actually draws, I'm guessing doubling it may even be out of the batteries cranking range.

the point, a relay is just a switch to send a lot of current somewhere by low voltage controls.
