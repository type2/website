Let me clarify (it's early, and I haven't had my tea yet)...

I have not seen very many ACVWs on the road *in Denver*.  Around 
Thanksgiving time, I posted about an ACVW shop I drove by in Pine, CO 
(which people seem to think is called &quot;Pine Beetles&quot; ... anyway, Pine 
is not that far away from Denver).  If you can confirm the name of this 
shop, you might want to give them a call and ask them about their 
experience with old ACVWs and regulatory compliance.
