&gt; so, what was the standard installation with a fridge?  is there a relay
&gt; kit?  i guess what i'm asking is, when i drive does the aux. battery get
&gt; trickle charged with the factory installation?  or do i need to
&gt; buy a relay kit?


The factory configuration on Westies with fridges was the same as with the
Hella relay kit, so if your relay is still working you should already be in
good shape.
