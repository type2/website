Subject: hydraulic valve lifters or not?
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

i had to take my 77 campmobile to a mechanic this weekend. now he's telling me
the fuel relay is out, and that when he can get it running, it sounds like
there is rod noise. he's withholding final diagnosis until he gets the new
fuel relay.

the PO threw a rod and had the motor rebuilt less than 10K mi ago. it's a 77,
but i noticed on some of the paperwork i inherited that it mentions hydraulic
valves.

a few weeks ago, i called the mechanic who rebuilt it for the PO to find out
if he had put in hydraulic lifters. he looked it up, but he still didn't
remember, and he said there's no way to tell from the outside, even if you
remove the valve covers.

i'm really really hoping the noise is a stuck hydraulic lifter (which
according to the list sounds a lot like rod noise), because i don't want to
rebuild this motor!

does anyone know of a definitive way to tell if one has hydraulic valve
lifters?

thanks,
carl
