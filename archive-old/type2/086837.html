Subject: Re: [T2] gas tanks

Billy,

Go look on the por-15 site or just give them a call.  I *think* I remember
that both are relative benign to the environment.  i live in the country
and end up drinking what goes in the ground....makes you think twice about
what you do with dangerous/toxic stuff out of your cars.

I think the insulation is fiberglass with an &quot;aluminum&quot; cover.

I don't remember what year your bus was, but i decided *not* to seal mine
because I couldn't figure out how the &quot;bowl&quot; around my fi inlet and
outlet pipes would get covered correctly....

If it's been xx years and still looks good inside then why seal?.....


Cheers, dave

&gt; Hey,
&gt; 
&gt; thanks to those who responded to my gas tank q's.
&gt; 
&gt; got it out finally, the feed tube to the engine compartment really hung up and I had to bend some of the sheet metal out of it's way.
&gt; 
&gt; q1: whats the insulation under the tank made of? any asbestos? I had to tear some away (wore my ventilator).
&gt; 
&gt; q2. my tank was very clean, bare metal all around, maybe a 1/2cup of orange laquer in the very bottom. I like the marine clean idea raised, as I try to shy away from home-chemical storage. is this stuff biodegradable?
&gt; 
&gt; q3. tank sealer?
&gt; 
&gt; q4. anyone remeber my rear seat/carpet questions?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks,
&gt;
