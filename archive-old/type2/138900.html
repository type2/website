&gt; Well, I thought that if the cable

&gt; a few years of life to my cable is well worth it. It's a gamble that I
&gt; don't mind making...

I don't think it matter what grease is used.

&gt; There were actually 2
&gt; strands left when I got under there.

That's how mine broke.

The cables corrode at the crimped end and snap. Keeping water and air out of
there in the first place is probably a better use of the grease. Even better
dip the end, minus the threads of course, in some plastic dip that used for
coating the handles of tools.

&gt; At the pedal end, instead of a clevis pin there was a bolt. No nut.
&gt; Just a bolt. The threads were stripped out from DPO trying to use it
&gt; to tap the hole in the arm. LoL!!! I'm surprised the thing has lasted
&gt; as long as it did!!!

The horrors!
 
&gt; I put everything together the way it should be, took a handful of
&gt; grease and slapped it at the opening of the tube and pushed it into
&gt; the cable as I fed the cable into the tube, replenishing as needed.
&gt; Yeah, this way was pretty wasteful but it was easier than having
&gt; greased cable flopping around outside of the tube. Kept it cleaner
&gt; too, I suspect. (BTW: I &lt;3 latex gloves now!!!)

Grease it up in the bag it comes in and feed it from the bag so it doesn't
pick up dirt during the install.
 
&gt; I'm assuming the need for using up the adjustment is due to a worn
&gt; clutch disk. (scribble scribble) I guess I'll get to drop my first VW
&gt; engine soon! It'll be strange not to have to mess with radiators and
&gt; coolant hoses and fans and crap. =D

As the clutch wears the fingers on the pressure plate move toward the
driver. This means less pedal effort is required over time but I doubt you'd
notice it especially as the cable stretches.

&gt; There are also supposed to be two rubber boots on the ends of the cable, one
&gt; where it goes into the tube at the front, and one where it comes out of the
&gt; flex tube. They are very often missing.

Beware the reproduction boots wherever you buy them. They do not last more
than a few months.
