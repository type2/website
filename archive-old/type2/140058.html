Subject: Re: [T2] Animal Control

There's a children's book out there where a king uses cats to get the
cheese eating mice out of his castle; then dogs, then lions, then
elephants....  :-)

Did the cat get in or mark your roof and it leaked?  How could it get
in?  Sink drain hole? Open window?

My sympathy's for the smell.  Good luck--maybe replacable carpet is a
blessing in this case!.  ..and I LIKE cats. :-/

Would an owl statue keep cats out?  strobe light?   I know you use
double sided tape to train a cat to stay out of a child's crib.

&gt; What about cats?

&gt; Apparently at some point in the recent past a cat had gotten into my
&gt; bus and pissed all over.
