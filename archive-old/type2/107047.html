Mike,

What you have on there are car tyres, not light truck tyres as per VW's
spec.  I can't tell you what to do or not do with your own vehicle, but
these tyres will give you distinctly iffy handling in side winds / round
corners.

I don't know how insurance companies operate in the USA, but over here they
will do anything to avoid paying out a claim.  If you have an accident as a
result of your incorrect tyres, you may not be covered.

If the tyres are in good condition, maybe someone will do you a trade-in
deal or swap for used tyres of the correct type?
