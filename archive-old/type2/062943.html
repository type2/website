Subject: Reply to guy in W Memphis (Camper for sale in Memphis)

You said you found one for sale 400 miles away? Well, One a recent excursion 
to Memphis (Labor Day Festival on Beale) I saw a 70-73 VW Westi for sale at a 
VW mechanic shop It was (if memory serves me) all light green and had the 
the complete camping package. It may have been off of Popular? Price on 
windshield was $2500. There can't be that many VW shops downtown and it was 
located next to a Midas muffler shop.
