Subject: Would like to borrow/rent camper in California
Content-Disposition: inline

Listers,

I am attending an academic conference in Los Angeles next week. After the conference (March, 19-24) I would like to see some of California's national parks. Since my own campers are on the East Coast and in Germany respectively, I would like to borrow or rent one in California. I could offer the use of my campers in return.

I am a fairly experienced VW owner (both type 1 and type 4 engines, I had/have: '65 sundial, '70 super beetle, '74 Westy deluxe, '78 European 1600dp, '79 Westy deluxe, '82 crew cab, '84 Vanagon). My campers are located in Takoma Park, MD (just outside DC) and Hameln, Germany (around Hannover).
