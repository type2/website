Hi Tom,

    With the stud in its horizontal position, and the nut in place, one of
the six long sides or flats will be up, or where you can hit it. Hitting it
only on one side should be enough, any more and you wont be able to get a
wrench on it.
    The idea is to put a chizzes mark on the long side of the nut, spreading
it on the inside enough to loosen it from the stud.
    Ever see a tool call &quot;the nut cracker&quot;, it is simply a hand held vice
with a bolt to tighten a sharp jaw on the nut to do the same thing, why
spend $30.00 if you don't have to?
    I hope this helps, if I'm not clear enough, let me know and I will take
a picture tomorrow and send it to you.
    By the way feel free to ask any questions any time, I will try my best
to get you an answer. Remember, no bad questions, just bad answers!
