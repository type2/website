Subject: RE: 76 westy No start after long trips???

&gt; What is the pull-in current on the Bosch coil vs. the Ford Pull-in
&gt; current ??


Couldn't tell you, but the starter relay issue has been mentioned on the
list in years past so it's possible that you might find that information in
the archives.
