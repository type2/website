&gt; 2) My compression gage is the screw in type with a hose 12&quot; attached to the
&gt; gage.  The problem is the fitting goes all the way into the motor sheet
&gt; metal and I am afraid that if I screw it in by turning the hose, I will not
&gt; be able to get it back out.  Is there a trick to this or a better type gage
&gt; to use?

there are extenders that screw onto the working end of the hose, I picked
up one for mine at the local FLAPS for a couple bucks.

&gt; 3) I want to be able to listen to the radio when the motor is off but have

well I have a Pertronix breakerless but I still wouldn't leave the
ignition on for very long without the engine running,.  why not take a tap
into the electrical feed to the ignition and create an accessory feed, I
did this and run a few things off of it..just be sure to fuse it.
