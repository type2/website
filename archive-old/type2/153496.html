Subject: RE: [T2] [ANOTHER QUESTION] Number of Gallons to Paint

Good Questions.
My experience is:  One quart (of color) won't do the job and two
quarts costs almost as much as a gallon.  So I get a gallon of color
plus whatever reducer and hardener is needed to serve that gallon of
color.  You end up with enough material to do two busses.  And make
sure the reducer is formulated for the weather condition you'll be
shooting in.
Best wishes....
