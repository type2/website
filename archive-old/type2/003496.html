Hi all,
 Nice to be back after the down time of the digest, thanks to all those who
helped to return me to bus bliss :)

Any-way I've looked in the archives &amp; read the blurb on the web site about
installing BA6 heaters, I have a friend who is selling his '78 westy (got
banned for D.D!). He is going to give :) me the BA6 for his van! How should
I remove it? Any tips on bits not to leave behind? etc.

I would REALLY appreciate any help.
