Subject: Brake vacuum hose question

Volks, 

I have a 74 Westy with an automatic transmission.  I replaced the brake
servo vacuum hose that runs from the manifold to the servo.  I replaced the
check valve that is in the line and I also replaced some sort of breather
which I wonder if it should be there.  This breather is a &quot;T&quot; connection
that has the two upper legs that go into each end of the vacuum hose and
then a smaller leg just went out into the open air.  I recall someone
saying at that time (I won't name names) who said that this is a breather
for the servo.  It seems to me that this allow more air into the manifolds
as well as provide less vacuum for the servo.  Thus, my questions:

1.  Should I just plug this and see what difference there is?
or
2.  Does this have something to do with the automatic transmission such as
providing vacuum to the tranny? (I do have the one vacuum line hooked to
the tranny and am unaware of any additional vacuum connections).

Thanks as always
