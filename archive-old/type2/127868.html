Subject: [T2]Weber DFEV 32/36 carbs

Really curious if anyone has used this carb brand new?
i may have a chance to sale my car today and if so that is what i have already on the bus and have borrowed ...from another bus owner....
i am looking to buy this same carb but brand new....
everywhere i look the kit is 319.95 + shipping and handling...~!~
is there a better alternative for the money than this carb and kit?
Should this give me performance and reliability..?
the borrowed one goes out of adjustment after awhile and has to be readujusted once again... also sucks on gas milage but may or may not be jetted for my engine as the new one will be jetted for the engine.._dot_comes that way...
 
ok before its said i cant afford duals and was looking into that but they are around 600-1000 k i cant handle that and am looking to spending about what the price of this is as a kit $319.95......
i need a brand new set up though not rebuilt,... 
the borrowed one adjustments screws are worn out so thats my reason for wanting a brand new one so that the screws and such dont have so much play in them...
 
looking for ideas or thoughts...?
cip1_dot_com has the best of these kits i have found which has free shipping i think over 50 bucks...?
thoughts ideas experience?
thanks
peace
