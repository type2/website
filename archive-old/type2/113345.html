Subject: accessory guages

Thinking of getting several accessory guages for my 76 Westy project, VDO of 
course, and was wondering which of the VDO line of tachs does anybody run? 
I'm partial to the cockpit vision. If anybody runs this tach what is the part 
#. Thanks in advance and I'm sure I'll have more questions later.
