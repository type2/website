Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Line replacement 68' 1600SP

&gt; I'm in the process of putting my engine back together, and I need to
&gt; replace the fuel line.  What is the propper line size?  I recall reading
&gt; someone's post stating that it should be 7mm, but according to the Bus
&gt; Depot site that size is for the fuel injected models.  I have a stock
&gt; 1600SP (68' Kombi).
&gt;
&gt; If I need something other than 7mm, please let me know who sells the
&gt; correct line.

right that is for FI.
