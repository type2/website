Subject: Re: [T2] Re:Re: [T2] Front Beam Question (sorry, misunderstanding
 on my part)

&gt; I'm sorry, but what I was refering to was the front portion of the frame.  I thought that is what is called front beam.  the whole front bar that sits under the bus's nose is badly rusted.  Can this be replaced without taking the bus off the frame (if that is possible)?  I am wondering what is entailed in this type of repair.

open up your Bentley (you do have one right?) to part 2 front axle.  fig
1.1 is what most people refer to when speaking of the &quot;Complete&quot; front
beam.  this particular drawing includes brakes and steering assemblies
which are frequently not part of a beam assembly.  the beams themselves
are the tubes that contain the front torsion bars and the suspension and
steering components attach to.

that is what most call the front beam, and the insides of the torsion bar
tubes have a bad habit of rusting from the inside out.
