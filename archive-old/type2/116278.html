Subject: RE: [T2] my bus has NOTHING to do with ScoobyDoo!!

Actually.. just so there's no confusion, I've never smoked pot in my life,
or even a cigarette for that matter. I drink all the alcohol that I need
though. I always found better ways to waste my money. :)

But, believe it or not, I purchased a 1997 GrandAm from CarMax back in
August of 2000. I was replacing the lightbulbs in the floor lamp by feeling
around. I didn't wnat to get on my back and sit upside down in the chair
backwards just so I could see the light socket, but never the less I
couldn't find the hole so I dropped the light-bulb. When I reached down to
pick it up, I acutally picked up something else under the passenger seat. It
was this little black keychain looking thing. Turns out, when you twisted
it, it opened up and was actually a small crack vial... it was half full
too. So, I called the police and told them I found crack in my car. They
told me just to throw it out because if I drove to the police station, and
gave it to them, they would arrest me for possession because posession was
9/10ths of the law or something. Figures... 

Needless to say, I called CarMax and told them to completely go through my
car and check for any weird crap.

Better check for hidden &quot;stash&quot;, if you ever get stopped and had a dog sniff
it out, you might be in for a surprise.

If you take it down to the sheriff's office, they might sniff it out for
you.

&gt; So even if half the pot smoking done in Fort Lauderdale was done
&gt; in this one VW Bus... that's ok with me, because now, it's my Bus. :)
