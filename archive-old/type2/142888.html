&gt; Well, I finally had my set of Bus Depot Konis installed last week.

What did you set yours to? I initially set mine to full firm in the
rear and half way (one full turn) in the front. Way too stiff.

I just walked in the door from adjusting them to full soft all around.
We'll see how that does.

A little side note: You can adjust them without removing them. Just
undo the bottom bolts/nuts, loosen the tops, slide the shocks off the
bottom and push all the way up. Then adjust making sure you keep the
shock vertical.

I'm surprised about the Hankooks. The way Ron and his customers raved
I expected better. Hmm... Maybe the ravers were just upgrading from
car tires that wallowed like a 71 Buick?
