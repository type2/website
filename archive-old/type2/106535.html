&gt;Once the valves start to float a little (max rpm of the valve train is reached) the lifters are unloaded slightly and the lifters pump up so that they will not allow the valve to close completely and the engine loses compression (some if not all) and / or the valve is sticking out in the combustion chamber.

With all due respect that is a valve spring vs. rpm issue, not a hydraulic lifter issue.

&gt;On some engines (dunno about aircooled VW's) the hydraulic lifters are heavier than solids and cause valve float at lower rpms.

Agreed, but what is &quot;lower rpms&quot;?  If hydraulics are only good to 6,000rpm vs. 7,000 for solids, does that mean you should use solids for the motor you're building with a 2000-5000rpm powerband?  Not in my world.  I've had VW solid and hydraulic lifters on the workbench side by side and while I will admit I didn't put them on a scale, the difference was not that great.  I've seen 5400rpm (once) with my hydraulic 2-liter and no valvetrain abnormalities were apparent.  Even with stock springs.

&gt;I'd stay with hydraulics for the regular driver engines and consider solids for a major rpm machine.

Again I agree with you.  Maybe my only point of contention on this issue is the definition of &quot;major rpm&quot;.  Before hydraulics would become a problem, my opinion is that you would have to have a very wild engine that would be unsuited to driving on the street.  I feel there are two groups of people that should be running solid lifters.  The first is professional drag racers and the second is '77 and older bus owners that want to keep their engines stock.  I don't fall into either group.
