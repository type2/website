Subject: Re: Dead Stickers: Probable Cause?

&gt;for that reason a friend had an amurrikun flag and an NRA sticker on his car.
&gt;   i wonder if the 'be a friend for life, dont drink and drive' sticker has
&gt;the same effect?
&gt;

I had an NRA Membership sticker on my car, and was searched by a CHP (I
agreed to consent). He asked it I had 'weapons.' I said no, except a tire
wrench. Ha ha ha.


He didn't even crack a smile.

Seriously, I think in some parts of the country an NRA sticker means 'gun
nut killer' to the police.

Way off VW content. Sorry.

Ken (gun nut killer?)
