Subject: OKTOBUGFEST - Puyallup, WA  USA

After years of not meeting anyone from the Lists at Oktobugfest in Puyallup 
(except 2 years ago when Tobin Copley and family were there) I really hit 
paydirt today.

Met Dan Simmons from Seattle, Clara from Olympia, Harald and Nancy from 
Olympia (they need to send me their e-mail address for future contact), &quot;Luke&quot; 
Lukey from Ballard (a free and independent Nordic republic within Seattle and 
King County), and Nate Morse and entourage from Bremerton.

Todd Hill was there doing his Volkswerks thing, Dawn Smyth and Steve Fronczek 
from Lake Forest Park with their PLF canvas goodies, Ken Madson and wife 
(sorry, I missed your name) with their Bus Co. stuff, and a gentleman from 
Olympia named (I think) Dan who was riding a very nice bicycle.  The PA at 
closing time was so noisy my ancient ears didn't quite &quot;Dan's&quot; name, but he's 
on the List.

I apologize if I missed anyone who stopped to say hello.  I was trying to take 
notes so my seeing-eye dog could transcribe them for me later but that effort 
was a failure from the start :)

As to obligatory BUS CONTENT:  A gentleman from Lake Oswego OR had a 
one-owner, 44,000 mile, absolutely perfect 1967 Westy on display.  He was 
asking $15,000 and it was probably the most fairly priced vehicle at the show. 
 He had all records from manufacture right up to his recent acquisition of the 
vehicle.  The bus had been owned and driven for only 5 or 6 years before the 
owner's death, then stored on blocks in a heated space by the family.  This 
rig is absolutely &quot;new&quot;, unrestored in any manner.  Not a single chip or mark 
to be found anywhere.  Awesome doesn't even begin to cover it...

Tom Connor, the guy from Deer Park, Washington who makes the nice custom 
and/or reproduction racks and ladders finally has an e-mail address.  If all 
goes well with his time and computer he'll probably be joining the Lists.  
Tom's e-mail address is:    racks_at_ior_dot_com

In the show area there was a 23-window sunroof splitty with one of Tom's 
racks.   The owner wanted a rack with taller legs to clear the roof when open, 
and Tom built it to the owner's specs.  It's full length, and even has the 
ladder option.  The rack is gorgeous, and an uninitiated observer would swear 
it came with the bus from the factory.  If you want a rack, talk to Tom.  You 
won't regret it.
