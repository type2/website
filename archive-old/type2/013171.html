Hang onto your receipt!!!
I had a compufire and it just didn't work right. Trigger plate cracked,
wires frayed at unit. they failed to include a critical spacer ring for
my particular model number.
I returned it under warranty and they were quite unpleasant.
I asked the customer support sales guy if he could see a trash can from
where he was sitting.
&quot;Throw it in there&quot; is what I told him. Ant thats it, I'll never buy
another of their products.
How can they be such hard asses over a component that cost them less than
$6.00 to produce.
I've used Allison ignitions on two of my cars and had complete
satisfaction on units running over ten years.
