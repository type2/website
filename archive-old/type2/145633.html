The bolt should just tap out.

Removing the tab on the sway bar bushing clamp is often hard because it's probably rusted itself together. Often the tab is damaged too much to reuse so you either have to use a new one or be extra careful.

The best way to reattach the tab after spreading the sway bar clamp is to use a pair of vice-grips at one end of the clamp and a pair of pliers at the other while you squeeze it to wiggle it on. Use some grease to help slide it on and don't foget to bend the tab up when you are done.

  ok well i have it apart now and yes i need at least a new clip i might be able to bend this original bracket back and that is a good thing after viewing the new brackets on atwells site..... i dont want ot have to bend those new brazilian things so they fit right....
   
   
  major question here??????????????????
   
  the bottom arm.... is there only one way it will go onto the splines?????? or can i mess that up./...?
  i got the new arm in there but not sure its right unless there is only one way it will slide on/in whatever....~!~
