Hi Folks,

Here's another idea.  Remove the screen altogether and duct tape the fresh 
air vents like I did on my Bus.  Up here in the mountains of Colorado, I was 
getting some serious wind thru the fresh air vents during the winter (now) 
no matter what position the blue lever was in.  If you need fresh air, open 
the windows.

The only problem with removing the screen altogether would be leaves, 
insects, small birds, etc. getting stuck behind the grille and retaining 
water which would eventually lead to rust and leaks above your feet (just 
like the old Mustangs).  Perhaps you could pus some aluminum or plastic 
behind the grille to keep out the nasties....

Good luck,
Jason Upper
