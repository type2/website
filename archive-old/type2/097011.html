Subject: Re: [T2] A Front Wheel Bearings Question

&gt;Three of the four races went in pretty much as I expected; after 5 or so
&gt;minutes of going 'round and 'round and gentle tap, tap, taping with my tack
&gt;hammer the races were home.  However, one race, a large inside race,
dropped
&gt;into place in the hot hub!  That is, I lined it up in its hole, let go of
&gt;the race expecting it would settle a millimeter or less, and it fell until
&gt;it was seated!
&gt;
&gt;The race seems secure enough in the cooled off hub, but I wonder if this
&gt;presages problems down the line.  Anybody have in experience in this
regard?

Mine all required a fair amount of pounding, even with the rotor pre-heated
in the oven. The concern would be if the race is loose enough to potentially
spin freely in the hub under load. Is the race seated tightly at room
temperature? You probably have to be the judge...  Keep in mind the hub will
get warm or hot on the highway and after braking.
