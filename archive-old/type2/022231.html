i'm putting my engine back together - 
and i'm ready to buy my exhaust...
the 20 year father/son business i had build it [the longblock] reccomends
the bus header exhaust system they have there for 99 something.. [will
surely be $110 like a stock muffler kit].

just wondering what the general thoughts are one way or the other... if it
matters, or if i should just go with the added hp the headers will offer.
is it going to affect exaust noise?
are there any possible problems i could encounter?

any comments, suggestions, and especially opinions appreciated, 
thanks,
