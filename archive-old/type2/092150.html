Subject: Re: [T2] Westy spare tire cover cushion (Was re-doing Westy interior)

I've got the one person fold out canvas cot up top.  I had the tire on the
front too, but took everything off when I painted, and put an emblem
back on
instead.  I've been on the list for over three years now, and am still
amazed at your 233k!  Maybe the cushion was some sort of westy option or
something. who knows?

&gt; Re having a &quot;stock&quot; foam cushion over the spare tire well in the 71

&gt; I had a European 71 a serviceman sold over here in the US- exact same
&gt; deal, a fiberboard that clipped in and a cushion with matching vinyl.
&gt; The tire was mounted on the front.  Does your Westy have a cot on top or
&gt; the European foamboard that hinges in the front and goes up with the
&gt; top?
