&gt; Got to say, i would definitely be looking for a lean running
&gt; condition...........maybe timing as well...................


Hello Adam. I am Gary G. Martin ggmartin_at_coin_dot_org

I am sorry I didn't cut and paste better to make it clear who actually had
the recurrent 6000 mile valve problem.

I don't have a valve problem.

multipang_at_kconline_dot_com has the valve problem.

I was offering him suggestions.

I always have my heads rebuilt at 50,000 miles. well, that is, after I really
got ripped off when I was young and dumb and I had a valve drop far from home
on a cross country trip. The ripoff mechanic sold me a worn out engine that
blew up 5 miles from gettin back home.  He tricked me into revealing exactly
what I had in my savings account and lo and behold, that is exactly what he
charged me. I had to sell blood plasma to get gas money to get out of town.

Now I am my own mechanic and I limit my cross country trips to within my
50,000 mile limit of head rebuilds.

I take the engines apart and I take the pieces to my favorite automotive
machinist. I have been taking him my engine parts since about 1972. He really
knows what he is doing. He does what he does and I just bolt the parts back
together and I get 50,000 trouble free miles from the engine. (albeit some
periferals do break) and then I take him the heads every 50,000 miles and I
get 250,000 miles from the bottom end before I chicken out and rebuild the
whole engine.

I really want to know why multipang_at_kconline_dot_com recurrently burns valves
after only 6000 miles.

I really want to know his final solution.

bye

Gary
