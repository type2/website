Subject: repost 1981 Westy a few questions

I reposted this do to a error on the URL to the pic
page.

Hi All,I have a few questions.All the pics for the
following question
can be fould
here:http://sky.prohosting_dot_com/~74thing/oilpump/oilpump.html
1. Oil PumpThe
oil pump I pulled from my engine is not the type 4 oil
pump pictured in
any of my books.
Can anyone tell me what pump it is?
To me it looks like a type 1 oil pump.
Will a type 1 pump work OK in the type 4 engine?
There are no VW markings, the only markings I can make
out are on the
cover &amp; there are:
8MM
USA2. Warm Air Blower VW # 070-256-051The Plastic
housing the surrounds
the warm air blower fan attached to the Alternator has
melted on the
bottom and lets air out.
Does anyone know it it can be repaired some how or
should I find one in
good condition &amp; replace it?3. Left Rear Engine TinOne
of the previous
owners removed tha AC my westy had &amp; when they did
they put this in for
the Left rear tin.
It is made of fiberglass and does not fit very well
and is badly
cracked in a few places.
I want to replace it with an original piece. If anyone
haas one or
knows where I can get one please let me know.
