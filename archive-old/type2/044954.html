&lt;&lt; My keys to survival on the road as a woman traveling alone: Assume you're
 not safe anywhere; &gt;&gt;
   Good advice, and not just for women, after all, wasn't it Michael Jordan's 
father who was murdered while sleeping in his car at a rest stop in North 
Carolina? I always avoid rest stops when I travel, as I've found they are 
magnets for weirdo's and scumbags, and would NEVER consider spending the 
night at one. As for the NRA sticker, IMHO this is not a good idea, 
especially when your vehicle is parked in your driveway. To me it is a red 
flag, saying &quot;Hey, I've got guns in my house!&quot; If some scumbag is going to 
break into my house/van, I'd prefer that the fact I may/may not have a weapon 
come as a surprise.            Jeff S.
