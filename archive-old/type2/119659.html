Subject: Use of Mobil 1 75-140 gear oil NOT!

Spurred by a recent post about gear oil here is what I asked for and got
from Mobile

&quot;Mobil1 Synthetic Gear Lubricant 75W140 is not recommended for your
transmission due to  high sulphur content that can corrode your yellow
metals that are present in your transmission.&quot;

	&gt;Is Mobile 1 synthetic gear oil 75W-140 compatible with yellow
metals in transmissions.  I have a 1978 VW Bus and all advice is to use GL4,
never GL5 because GL 5rated oils will corrode bronze and brass and any other
yellow metals.
	&gt;
	&gt;Thank you.  I would like to use Molile1 75W-140 if I can without
potential harm to my manual transmission
