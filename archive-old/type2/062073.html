Subject: Problem with Tail Lights

Hello Everyone,
        This weekend we tryed to take the '81 Westy out but the blinkers
and tail lights were not working properly.  If I turn on the tail lights
the tail lights and the blinker lights light up.  If I flip the turn
signal the tail lights and the blinker lights on both side start to flash.
What gives?  Does this sound like anything you know?

        Thank You.
        johnny Stutsman
