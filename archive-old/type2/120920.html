Subject: Re: [T2] Tires (again)

I was looking too, and found the Continental VANCO 8 at Tire Rack for 
$64.  They are load range D.  See specs at:

http://www.conti-online_dot_com/generator/www/us/en/continental/automobile/themes/van/motor_home/vanco_8/master_en.html

These tires were OE on my Eurovan, and lasted over 50k.  I tend to drive 
fairly fast through the twisties and brake hard, and did notice they 
slide a lot quicker than the Michelin Agilis 51s I have on now.  The 
Agilis lasts well over 60k under hard driving habits, but they cost 
$100+.  They handle better in both dry and wet, but are a bit noisy 
until they get 20k on them.  As much as I like the Agilis, I will 
probably go with the Contis for my newly aquired Westy, since I don't 
plan on driving it that hard.
