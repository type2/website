&gt; knew someone who used these quickie boots on his car (not a VW) and, 
&gt; despite
&gt; warnings to the contrary, they lasted many tens of thousands of miles until 
&gt; he
&gt; finally sold it..
&gt; 

Hey guys  I have seen fhese only last around the block also   Junk is my 
thoughts on them   Now I just got one of those tools that expands the boot over 
the joint without having to remove it from the axle   This works real well but 
not really for buses or vanagons as the have that flange  but on other cars it 
is great  later  Mark Dearing
