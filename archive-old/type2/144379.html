HUH? Hhat?  I am dead flat certain that the housings, axles, bearings, and
seals are the same from '73-'79 and that the bearings, axles, and seals
are the same at least thru '83 (altho the V'gon housing is quite
different) and had always &quot;known&quot;  that this was true from '68-79.  If it
isn't, PLEASE someone post!

OOK!
