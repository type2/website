Subject: Re: Car Insurance for US Vacationers in the UK?

Has anyone had any experience getting car insurance in the UK
&gt;&gt;&gt;(other than with cars rented from rental companies)?  Must we actually buy
&gt;&gt;&gt;the van in order to buy insurance for it?  Any advice?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Thanks,

&gt;&gt;Hi Ron, been away in Spain the last 3 weeks so dont know if you've had a
&gt;&gt;reply on this.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;You can buy insurance in UK over the phone but you'll need to quote the
&gt;&gt;vehicle details, so you cant just get a blanket policy to cover anything, I
&gt;&gt;dont think. You shouldn't need to actually own the vehicle.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Your best bet is to call up a broker such as Adrian Flux who specialise in
&gt;&gt;VWs and see what they say. The international code is 044 1553 777888.
