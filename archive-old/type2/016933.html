Changed the fuel and air filters. Adjusted the brakes. Adjusted the
clutch. Pulled the carb and cleaned it out some. Topped up the gear oil.
Killed a chicken on the roof at midnight on the full moon. Begged it.

     I set those puppies a year ago and it ran fine ever since. Why
would they suddenly need resetting? It's kind of a pisser that I spent a
month sweating this out when I could have fixed it wtih a screwdriver in
the first five minutes. On the other hand, the beast now runs better
than ever and we've spent some quality time together. It's a joy to be
able to pull up to a stop sign with no need for the old Mario Andretti
heel-toe action.

Randy:
I'd suspect vacuum leaks. Resetting the idle air bypass and mixture
might have compensated for anover lean condition. Maybe the manifold
sleeves? Also you mentioned air filter. Huh? Don't you have an oil bath
air cleaner? What do you do for preheating carb air when it's cold?
I know winter in Seattle is like a blustery October day here in Iowa,
but 40-45F is cold enough to need carb preheat, and would ruin your
idle.
Also why don't you teach your e-mail program to do line wraps. I'm no
computer whiz, but Netscape mail figured that one out for me. It would
make your post much easier to read.
Then again, maybe you got chicken feathers in the idle air bypass,
through that non-stock air filter.
Elvis who?
