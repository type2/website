The FI system requires proper voltage to run properly.  A bad alternator can
cause performance problems that will have you chasing your tail.  Check  to
see that its doing its job, with appropriate amperage and voltage being
generated.

Finally made it out of Salem,VA. Turns out that the temp sensor had little
to no effect on my problem. I had no power at highway speeds. Stopped in At
Salem Imports and got some assistance from Mark and Co. I have several probs
and at my wits end. While in Salem we found a bad connection to the double
relay and a few vacuum leaks and noticed that the engine is running very
lean. thought we had it fixed and was very wrong. Made it to Staunton at a
very slow 30-35 mph. Got a fuel pump from a flaps and put it on. Back to
65-70 mph and again thought I had it fixed. I am now in pinegrove,pa and it
appears that I am still running lean but the twist is that I am getting
about 13 mpg and to add to that now I am having dizzy probs. Getting cozy in
the comfort inn and will check tomorrow.

Any suggestions as to why I am running so lean but getting such crappie gas
mileage????

Any help or suggestions would be very appreciated

Thanks
Chris
