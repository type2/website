Since these shelters became available COSTCO's had a hard time keeping them
in stock due to their popularity.  They are seen in condo and apartment
parking lots all over our region, covering everything from Airstream
trailers and yachts to Mercedes convertibles.

As the shelters are basically large tents, and &quot;temporary&quot; installations,
they don't seem to run afoul of municipal zoning regulations or
condominium/apartment complex rules and covenants.  We see them often in
parking areas of some VERY big-buck gated condominium communities.

FWIW...

&gt;&gt;  unfortunately not an option. it's a shared parking lot, and i'd probably
piss off  more than a few neighbors by putting this up. besides, i don't
think i'm allowed to [my place is a condo, and it probably violates at least
one of the many silly bylaws].  &lt;&lt;
