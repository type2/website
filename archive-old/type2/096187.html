&gt; &gt; well I ordered some from Bus Depot and they gave me a time but they did
&gt; &gt; come sooner, you also can speed em up with higher priority shipping
&gt; I'll consider that, thanks.
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; Does anyone have a recommendation for another vendor who might be a bit
&gt; &gt; &gt; quicker? 
&gt; &gt; last time I did that, used the vendor that was fastest, turned out to be
&gt; &gt; the slowest because the quality was so low and had to redo the job.
&gt; 
&gt; That's why I'm looking for recommendations. :) I want them to be really
&gt; good -- if I'm going to invest the money I want them to last.

seems the problem is that anyone any good can't do em right as fast as
people want em.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Another option might be to get my current heads rebuilt -- anyone know
&gt; &gt; good to have a spare anyway
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; one thought would be to find a junkyard engine with heads, use them while
&gt; &gt; haveing your &quot;known&quot; heads rebuilt
&gt; 
&gt; Alas, the local boneyards are pretty well picked-over. I'm planning on

don't forget the engine is the same as a 73-74 412 sedan or wagen (FI is
different, but the heads should be swappable ????)
