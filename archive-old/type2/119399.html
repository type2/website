Damn, I guess they didn't get him yet. Let's hope he is found and
brought to justice, if there ever was any, it's needed here.


...
&gt; Well, I just called.  First Mr. Keeling who was the lead investigator has
&gt; died.  Second, her murder is still open in their books, so if someone was
&gt; arrested it did not pan out.  I am supposed to get a call back from the
&gt; current prinipal investigator and will report further at that time.
