I have one, but it is not within driving distance, unless you like long
drives. I have one off a 73, near perfect, even the canvas is good. Just
needs to be cleaned I am letting it go real cheap. I am in the Tacoma Wa.
Area.

Hi all,

My '69 Westi still has the original smooth top, no ribs or bumps near the
pivot bolts.  I am NOT a fan of this top.  It has numerous stress cracks
near the bolts as well as along the vertical portions, and will NOT stay
down in the wind.  I have resorted to tying it down with a cargo strap
running gutter to gutter.

As soon as I find a ribbed replacement for a reasonable cost withing driving
distance, I'm there.
