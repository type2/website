Subject: Weird Brake happenings ('74)

hey now,

i noticed my brakes on Rumba the '74 Retrowestie feel sorta looser today but
the brakes still work fine. but i've also noticed that when i pump the brakes,
the engine sounds like it is getting stronger. not revving but just idling
stronger. could this be a vacuum leak somewhere? yesterday i fiddled with
tightening the clutch and i reckon' i coulda knocked the vaccuum hose a bit.

in general though, i've found when the vacuum hose is loose or something is
wrong, the brakes get harder to pump. any advice/ideas?
