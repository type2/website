Most books say that you have to remove the engine before removing the fuel
pump.  I think it could probably be done with the engine in, but I haven't
actually tried it.  You will definately have to remove that air duct
though.  It's not hard to do, the bottom two bolts are removed from the
outside, and the upper two from the inside.  The upper bolts also hold on
the &quot;dish&quot; that connects to the air filter box.  You will need to remove
the air filter box to get access to these bolts, and even then it can be
difficult.  When you reassemble, it's easiest to have another person with
you to hold the duct while you fasten it from the inside.

&gt;* Any other reasons why my engine lacks power? I didn't check the
&gt;air-tightness on the manifolds yet, I postponed that.

First things first - how is the compression?
