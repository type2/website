Subject: Re: [T2] Where to buy fuel line clamp

Good work Matt.

I've called twice and gotten a full voice mail inbox both times.
Emailed once, no responce.

You, me, and was it Arnaud who are out right now?

Let's collectively mention each other's names when/if we get a hold of him.

Billy





&gt; OK - for anyone else who is having problems with the fuel clamps:
&gt;
&gt; I called the number on the website (206.227.7355), and spoke to
&gt; Christopher Goodwin himself. Apparently, Christopher Goodwin Tools has
&gt; not been around for a couple of years. He is now Christopher Goodwin
&gt; Motorsports, and seemed surprised that the website was still up and
&gt; running. (I noted, however, that he didn't ask for the URL or any other
&gt; details so that he could investigate further)
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, he took my name and said he'd refund the money on paypal. We'll
&gt; see...
&gt;
