Subject: BA4 Temp Sensor Replacement?

Hi,

Does anybody know of a replacement/substitute  part for the Temperature
sensor out of a BA4 heater.

This is the one that senses output heat temperature in the heater
channels from the heater.

Part # 211 963 261
Also labelled 'GERMANY TF601 096'

resistance in 60C (140F) water is 3.5 to 5kOhm.

I'd just rather not pay $65 for another one if I don't have to (the
whole setup only cost $30).

Thanks
Dave
