&gt; 
&gt;  anyway the point of my correspondence. you dudes need to look at the front
&gt;  beam where the steering swing arm is welded to it. looked at mine, found a
&gt;  crack. looked closer (wire brush etc) and its cracked from one side to the
&gt;  other. in time it would have snapped off and i would have had no steering. 
&gt;  has anyone else come across this? its a 72 westy.
&gt;  

I, and others on the list, have had this happen - several while driving. If it
has cracked then its probably very rusty inside and close to failure. This
pending failure is life threatening!

I don't wish to be a bearer of gloom and doom - but the best advice is to keep
your bus off the road until you have fitted a replacement front beam. 
On replacement I found several holes on the inner faces of the shock absorber
towers too - next to the chassis where they are covered up.

Good luck
Bob
