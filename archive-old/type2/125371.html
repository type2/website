Subject: Re: [T2] rear negative camber

Rob,

yes, best to get any suspension problems fixed before spending all that 
dough on new rubber!

this is definitely an interesting problem! yes, i would go ahead with 
the minor adjustment that you read about in Bentley.

however, first you might want to spend a little bit of money &amp; see if 
you actually have a definite problem. take the bus to an alignment shop 
(find one with old-timers that know what they are doing!). have them 
check the specs of the rear alignment &amp; see how far out of adjustment 
you might or might not be. compare the results to the alignment specs 
in Bentley. it might be money well-spent.

just an idea. its the only thing i could come up with for this strange 
problem!

good luck,

Joel Wilson
