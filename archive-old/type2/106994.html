Subject: Re: [T2] removing axle beam Q's

Don,

Don't know about your 71, but on my 79 I could loosen the 2 bolts that 
hold the MC to the booster and remove the beam....don't forget about the 
vacuum line and the other line on the booster though.

I forget how it was exactly, but you should be able to do it...watch out 
for the brake fluid feed lines too.

Cheers, dave

&gt; 1.  Is it possible to remove a beam off a 71 with the booster without 
&gt; opening up the brake system?
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  Bently doesn't show procedure for removal of beam with a booster.  
&gt; I'm at that point and would welcome any suggestions on how next to 
&gt; proceed. (Do I remove mc, or can I disconnect it from booster, or can I 
&gt; just remove booster from beam and tuck vac hoses aside?  I just don't 
&gt; want to create too much unneccesary work)
&gt; 
&gt; thanks
