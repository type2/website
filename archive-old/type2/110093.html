Subject: Even more alternator issues...

So I think Portia read my emails and found out I was planning to work on the
charging system. This afternoon I jumped in the bus - no start. I push started
her and went on my merry way - making sure I took a cruise on the I-way before
stopping again. When I got back in to leave - she wouldn't start and the fuel
pump was barely going! I got a jump and pulled into a friendly parking lot.
The voltmeter read 6V at the battery (with the engine running). I double and
tripled checked and then started messing around on the dash. I turned on the
lights 'too see what would happen' and the engine died. Doh!

I went in the coffee shop I was parked in front of and called a friend to
commiserate. I ate some dinner waiting for him to show up. We jumped started
the bus. This time 4.7V. Not good. I closed up the bus and the engine died. I
jumped her again and backed out of the spot and the engine died. I jumped her
again and with much finesse and back-firing, made it home. 4.7V ain't enough
to run both an electric fuel pump and fire the spark plugs at the same time...

Anyhow, I was planning to take her to the local VW garage (Lockhart's VW
Repair in Chattanooga) tomorrow to get the ball-joints done and a wheel
bearing replaced in preparation for a trip to Florida tomorrow. Now I'll have
to have them try to swap out the alternator for me (it's Bosch rebuilt from a
local supplier - if I can find the receipt I'll be set).

Anything else I should have them check? It's got a new battery, started, VR. I
really do need a new wiring harness from the alternator to the
starter/battery. I just hope the local vendor has the parts!

-Eric
