Subject: RE:  Sliding Door
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.9910121116450.89059-100000_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;

&gt; &gt;I have a '71 Bus with a sliding door problem I can't figure out.  I 
&gt; &gt;replaced the U-shaped part on the middle/rear side of the door and 
&gt; &gt;now I think it might be the roller located under the rear window.  
&gt; &gt;But the door doesn't &quot;Pop&quot; out when pushing on doorhandle. 

i guess im just forgiving but this never really bothered me too much.
Since my 71 is my daily driver im pretty used to its ins and outs.

to open from the outside i open the latch and then give the door a soft
pop with the heel of my hand voila it pops right out. (its fun when
friends try to do it and i get to go up and tap it like fonzie taps a
jukebox... magic, hehe)

&gt;From the inside i face forward, disengage the latch, and softly bump my
hip against the door and zoom it slides rearward.

The only downside is that i have to explain it to passengers, but i kinda
like this better.  If i have to explain to em how to open it then i get
to give the dont slam speech _before_ they have slammed it and made me
cringe.

peas,

Steve
