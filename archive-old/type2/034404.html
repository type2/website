ok here goes! sorry about this, i know there have been recent posts and
i cant remember who said what, but regarding gl-4 and gl-5. (by the way
i dont pretend to know anything about  anything so keeping that in
mind), i just put a rebuilt engine and tranny in the kreeper. going to
start it tomorrow. (how many of you get nervous starting a motor for the
first time!?)  :-)  anyway the tranny rebuilder said .....gl-5...the
local vw service manager?......gl-5  they both say that 5 supercedes 4
and takes into consideration the specifications that 4 handled. so those
of you who have concerns.._dot_can you tell me briefly why the concerns and
what the experience entailed..how many miles...rebuilt, new, etc. the
list has been so helpful and during the installation saved me more thatn
a few times both with questions and the wealth of info thanks! oh as an
aside..the book specifies gl-5 for the final drive in the auto and it
has a brass gear also according to the tranny guy. he is from local
reputable shop that has been in the biz for a while. VW Paradise.
