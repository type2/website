&gt; It doesn't sound like the cat to me.  More than likely its the O2 sensor.

Is there an O2 sensor on a fed model? I have one on my CA model, but thought
the O2 sensor was introduced on all Vanagons in 83-1/2 with the intro to the
wasserleaker. Only CALIFORNIA models pryor to 83-1/2 had the O2 sensor. ???
