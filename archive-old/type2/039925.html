Nope. I'm telling you, hats is the way to go. I am _not_ going to go 
around staring at people's chests. 

The best hats would be like baseball caps (or cyclist's caps) but squared 
off and decorated to look like a bus. Westy owners should figure out how 
to construct a poptop hat with the top popped. Nikki and Dave should wear 
top hats.
