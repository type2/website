-&gt;&gt; &gt; If a car with a &quot;bad year&quot;
-&gt;&gt; &gt; rap (IE , my 72) that has had a good owner, its better then a &quot;good
-&gt;&gt; &gt; year&quot; car owned by a cowboy electrician. Thats my .o2s worth.
-&gt;&gt; 
-&gt;&gt; Duncan, my 72 has been really good, and I owned a string of 71's (and a few
-&gt;&gt; earlier splitties) along the way . . . other than the aggravation of
-&gt;&gt; workin' on it (no access thru upper deck - been thinking about getting
-&gt;&gt; handy with a circular saw) what are the unique problems with the 72 ??
-&gt;&gt; 
-&gt;
-&gt;
-&gt;First year for the Type IV engine, no over-engine access hatch (good
-&gt;luck changing #1 and #3 plugs)...
-&gt;
-&gt;


It is doable, and not really a bear if you do not know anything else.  
 
You can add one though, I saw one a few months ago.  Cut the access hatch
and surrounding metal out of a 73 or later, and cut a hole (slightly smaller
than the piece you cut out of the donor bus) in your 72.  Lay the donor
piece over and weld/jbweld/glue it on.  The guy I saw used JB Weld and
silicone to seal it up.  

I bought a 75 bus (with bad motor, no FI, shot interior, no passenger
window, and nasty dog smell inside) for $125 for the tires ($75 for bus, $50
for the tow home).  I just got a reciprocating saw (mmmm power tools:), and
am going to do the engine access hatch swap.   

Yes the 75 is repairable.  I am going to seal up the hole I make in it, and
either stick an old (but running) engine in it and clean it up to sell it,
or sell it as is.  Of course I need to find the tittle first.  At least
I know it is somewhere inside my house:)
