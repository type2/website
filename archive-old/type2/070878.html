&lt;&lt; Question: my wife and I have hotel reservations for the Eureka Spring, Ark.

VW event, Aug24th. Are any of you going or do you know anything about it?

The financial timing is a little off. If there is alot for me to learn I'll

still go, but if it's not a really big deal I'll put the bucks into the Bus.

Anyone? &gt;&gt;

I've been for the past 4 years.  The location the past couple of years 
sucked.  Crowded and hot and in a hole behind a motel.

Hot VWs, or some other VW mag did a write up on it last year.  The show 
continues to grow and you see more buses every year.  

You can also find some parts deals, but get there early or stay until late 
when the vendors are packing up and don't want  to take  it all back home 
with them.

My '74 Campmobile won 1st. in the '68-'79 custom bus category last year.  And 
though she's nice, she ain't no show bus.
