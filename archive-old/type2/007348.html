I built one for my '76 Westy, basically copying the design of the one in the RMMW catalog which sells for $99.00. Its made of plywood (sides and bottom) which was then covered with black automotive carpeting. The hinged lid and coffee cup holder were made from red oak,* which I stained. It hold two coffee cups (or sodas, but not &quot;Big Gulps&quot;) and a ton of other stuff in the hinged compartment. Too much, in fact, mine is always a mess, as I tend to use it as a dumping ground. It is not bolted down, just sits between the seats, so it can easily be removed.  Jeff
* If I had it do over, I would have used a clear sealer. (cost was maybe $25.00, and an afternoons time-check the scrap wood bin at Home Depot, everything is $1.00)
