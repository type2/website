Subject: Radio interference from my Christmas wreath

I made up this great steel bar to bolt onto my spare tire carrier, mounted a
lighted wreath on that and ran the line to an inverter plugged into my
cigarette lighter.  All works fine and looks good (even checked with the
cops first:  as long as it doesn't blink, I can light the bus up any way I
want).  But once you turn it on, my faithful old Sapphire radio is
overwhelmed by static.

Can I cure that with a filter?
