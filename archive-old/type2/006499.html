Hey , thanks for the feedback about engines a while back . I finally had
time to pull the thing apart last week. All went well, i think, depending on
how you look at it . Pulled off the head along with the piston and the rod
on number 4 i think (rear left) . Then I got stopped dead in my tracks on
that little 30 mm crankshaft pulley nut . breaker bar , cheater pipe ,
screwdriver jammed in to keep the pulley still , and blocks on every side to
help my foot hold the case down ((no engine stand :( )) . I think the pulley
will rip apart before that nut loosens even a hair . Have any of you
encountered this and if so could you tell me what worked for you ? I applied
oil with a vengence and tried that hammer and chisel thing that I read about
in my idiot guide . Any and all advice , drastic or not , would be greatly
apreciated at this point . Thanks.......
