Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel smell after filling.

In my case it was the fuel vapor recovery system. The lines that vent the tank
were old and the charcoal canister was old. Once I replaced all of this, I do
not get any gas fumes. You can replace the lines on the top of the tank with
out removing the engine on a 73, not sure about others, but it does require
removing the carb(s) to get the firewall out. It is not easy, but it will come
out.
