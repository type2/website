Subject: Re: [T2] 72 vs 75 engine hatch

As Vincent said

&gt; The engine hatches of the modelyears 1972 and 1975 are
&gt; the same. From modelyear 1977 until 1979 a different
&gt; hatch was used. The difference is in the hinges. The
&gt; 1972-1976 hinges are fixed to the body with two screws
&gt; each. The 1977-1979 hinges are smaller and fixed with
&gt; only one screw each.

The hatch is the same, the hinges are different,, but the interchange in
this way.........

The late hinge hatch with the bent wire and one mounting screw will fit
the early body with 2 screw holes.. without modification

the other way around,, you would have to modify something,, you pick ,,,
the body indentation needs to be wider, another hole added to the body,
the hinge on the lid cut in half? I dunno if that is possible

Hope that helps
