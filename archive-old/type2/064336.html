Subject: Bracket in rear of '77 Camper - What is it

I have a '77 Camper and in the back right above the &quot;storage dimple&quot; by 
the engine hatch there are two brackets on the driver's side wall. It 
looks like something would fit on to this bracket, but I have no idea 
what.

Does anyone know what this is?

Thanks,
Patrick
