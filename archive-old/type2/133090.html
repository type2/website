Subject: Re: [T2] AVP or AMC Heads for 2.0 FI?

Jason,

You missed the long post from Ron last week on that very subject...based 
on my personal experience and Ron's long discussion of what AVP does to 
their heads....I would buy AVP...Jake Raby and his &quot;head&quot; man probably do 
a much better job for super-high performance stuff, but for daily use, AVP 
would probably be fine.

Go back into the archives and look for Ron's post...

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm still trying to source good inexpensive heads for my 2.0 FI.  So far, I 
&gt; have found that both AVP and AMC offer heads that work on the 2.0 FI 
&gt; engines.  I checked the archives, and AMC appears to have a less-than-ideal 
&gt; reputation -- almost as bad as GEX engines.
&gt; 
&gt; cash outlay for a very significant part, any constructive opinions are 
&gt; helpful.
