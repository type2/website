Subject: Re: Westy tent plastic clips - what to use if broken?

From: &quot;Mike&quot; &lt;jester_at_cfnson_dot_com&gt;

&gt;to see if I could add it to the number of VW-related masters sitting on the work table next to me at this moment.

Got it.  I missed the reference to actually reproducing them in the earlier message - thought you were just looking for spares for yourself.  Seems like it 
would be a relatively easy part to do.  Guess I could help a neighbor - send me your snail?
