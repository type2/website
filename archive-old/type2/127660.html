Subject: Re: [T2] Driveshaft Problem

&gt; I'm hoping someone can help, i was traveling to a local VW event yesterday
&gt; when i sudenly heard a noise like a piece of cardboard in the wheel of a
&gt; bike, this quickly turned into a loud thumping noise.  I pulled to the side
&gt; of the road to find the driveshaft had come away from the wheel side.  On
&gt; closer inspection i found that one of the bolts had completly sheered off,
&gt; My first problem is trying to remove the the sheered bolt.  The second and
&gt; what i am posting this e-mail about is what can possibly have caused these?
&gt; Is it just possible i have clipped a kerp sheering one bolt and over time
&gt; the rest have worked free, or is it likely to be something much more

Yes. The bolts all worked free and then you sheared off the last one.
You should check the cv bolt torque a few times after you work on them and
then probably good to have a look when you adjust the brakes and change
the oil.

You may have munged up the threads a little.
You should be able back the sheared off bolt without too much trouble.
You may want to remove the stub axle to work on it. I think its easier
that way and you will be able to chase the threads with a tap if they need
it.
