Subject: Camp Box News

 Anybody else get their new issue of Camp Box News?  Mine came today,, I was
beginning to think that Todd had dropped off the face of the earth!!!!
For any Westy nuts out there this is THE zine for you,,, this new issue
 contains part III of the series on wood slat roof racks,,interesting tidbit-
in Europe the '68 through '79 models could be ordered with a wood slat rack,,
pictures are there,, looks odd to me, but there it is in black and white,,,
also an interesting article on a Mercedes Benz Westphalia camper,, looks like
a Dormobile style roof 
 I'm not connected in anyway to Todd , but if interested dues are $10 yr.($12
Can)  to CBN  1728 Evansdale Ave.  Toledo, Ohio 43607                  PINK
