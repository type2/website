Following advice from Tim, Steve, and Chris, I dumped my 24 year-old 
european-origin oil last weekend, and put in 85W-90 GL-3/Gl-4. What an 
improvement in both cold and warm shifting. If someone has some spare time 
this weekend, I can highly recommend this PM. The shift lever feels like I'm 
cutting butter instead of cream cheese!
