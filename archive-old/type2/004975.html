Dan,
It turns out you were right... the &quot;cap&quot; under the wiper mechanism somehow
slid down, impacting on the hex nut... most of the {plastic} cap broke away
when I took the assembly apart, but I had enough of it left to use as a
spacer, until I can buy a new cap... when I re-assembled it, it worked MUCH
better than before, and I'm happy!

BTW, the wipers still run WAAAAY too slowly... is there a electronic unit I
can buy or build to make it go faster? Perhaps a dwell unit?

My 30th Anniversay Muir's &quot;Idiot&quot; manual arrived in the mail today...
ordered it from Amazon 9th Sept!

The weather is heating up here in Australia... looking forward to this
weekend... going bussing with my wife, and 2 year old grand daughter (cute!)

GK

| Sounds like you may need to take the wiper assembly apart, clean all the
rust

happen

unusable

shape

seals
| and stuff.
