&gt;interesting how many members of this list have a Saturn in addition to our
&gt;buses.   I don't but my wife has a SC-1 coupe.......oh well.  knock on
&gt;wood but I have rescued her in my bus more often than she has rescued me


Funny...I resemble that remark. My wife has an SW-2, funny thing is that 
since I moved last year and started driving the Vanagon daily, the Saturn 
has never let me down. Like today I am driving it and yesterday and Saturday 
when I went to Austin VeeDub(thanks Richard) to get the parts for the GL. 
But I hope to be back in the driver's seat of the Vanagon tonight.
