Hi! My name is JT, and I'm new to this list, so I appologize in advance if
I'm asking a question that's already been beaten to death or something. 

I just bought a 1978 VW Bus with a pop-up top. I've seen it one time, and
the interior is very nice. It has a sink (pump variety), propane hookups,
etc. The paint is good and there is almost no rust on it at all, and
someone with too much time on his hands put in hardwood ceiling and floors.
Unfortutely, someone else was not nice to it and it ran out of oil and died
a loud and angry death. The only other problem is that somewhere along the
line someone cut out/lost the front portion of the plastic top of the
pop-top. But I can deal with it, as I bought it for the one-time-only low
price of $25 american dollars. Ah, I love bargains. 

So, even if it needs an entire engine, it's a bargain. Supposedly, some
expert or another decided it just needs a head gasket, but that I don't
believe. Now three weeks from now I am starting on a road trip, which I
hope to take in this bus (not in my 82 dodge diplomat gas guzzler).
Basically, I am looking for advice on perfoming a very quick engine
overhaul, and what sorts of roadblocks I am bound to encounter. Does anyone
know of any good resources of information on rebuilding '78 2000cc engines?
That's what I assume it is, since that's the only one I've seen mentioned
as being in 78 buses. Also, I'm not sure about idetifying the type of the
pop-top, so I can obtain a replacement for the missing parts. 

Great thanks to anyone who is willing to help. Hopefully, this great
vehicle will see the open road again soon!

JT
