&gt; I hate saying this but I have to concur.

&gt; The actual name of the host is irc.efnet_dot_net, channel is #vw, hope to see
&gt; you all there.

I'll check out the efnet thing, thanks for the address Ken.

BTW, has anyone ever considered the ICQ chat process?  I downloaded it and find
some of its features very handy.  Some features include a contact list that will
tell ya when,  those you choose to put on it, are online.  You can remain
invisible, you can even ignore someone if you want too.  It costs nothing and is
not very big to download it.  It would be very handy and might be worth
considering.

May the busma keep us keeping on.
