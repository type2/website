Adam,

To get the upper torsion arm off, you *must* remove the bump stop!  Then
slather grease on the horn, then pound like an SOB.  they are a bear to
remove, I am sorry to say.

To remove the bump stop, look inside the horn it sits on, ther eis a clip
like the clips that hold the brake lines in place.  Spray it with Kroil,
then bang it a bit with a screwdriver and hammer, then grip it with a
needlenose vice grip and pull it out.  then lift[1] the arm off it and it
will pry out.

[1] Your post implies that you have removed the steering knuckle.  The
first time I did this, I made the same mistake.  MY cure was to
re-assemble the whole thing and put the wheel back on the ground.  That is
the safe way to do it.  If I did it again today (which I wouldn't, I know
better) I *might* try propping something under the arm and lowering the
bus onto it to get some clearance... Up to you... it sure ain't safe, but
it might work.
