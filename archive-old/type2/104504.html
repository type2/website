Subject: Re: [T2] Hunk-a Horse Hair 

&gt; The springs of the mattress box springs were layered over with something
&gt; that/which reminded me of the 'horse hair' padding on my '72 seats.

And is likely the exact same stuff.  Often a mix of horse and pig, if I
recall what some of my suppliers told me a few years ago.

&gt; I am wondering:  would it be possible to replace the 'horse hair' padding on

Sure would.  Be sure to pack it tightly..if you don't do it while your
stuffing it'll happen when you're sitting on it. :)

It would also be a good idea to wrap your seat frames/springs in burlap or
such to help hold the hair together and keep it from falling through.

Personally, I prefer a nice 80 or so pound foam. :)
