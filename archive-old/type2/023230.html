Is there such thing as a nice SMALL antenna for a CB. I'm interested in 
making my CB permanent when my bus goes back on the road in the next few 
weeks and it would be nice to add it now while the dash is out and I can 
run the cables.

What I'd like to have is a small antenna to add to the rear of the pop top 
(permanently mounted) like the late model VW's use (Beetles, Passat, 
Jetta). Those are AM/FM antennas but is it possible to use one for a CB 
without killing the CB's range badly? I use my radio for 'road reports' (CH 
19) and to communicate with friends when travelling together.

The only CB antennas I have ever seen are the types that Radio Shack - 
certainly useful but pretty doggy looking.

I plan to add a speaker under the center dash grille used by VW for their 
OEM '78 mono radio for the CB output speaker.

Thanks all!
