I found out its a stewart warner southwind?  for a bug...but man its big...
my type 4 has the spare wheel in the way on the opposite side of the
battery, has anybody fit one in there?
im sure i could do some modifications to fit it in there. I wish i could
some thing to my bus without doing mods evertime...but i guess thats how i
save money....
TIA
