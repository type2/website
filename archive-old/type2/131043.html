A question not directed at me but I will answer regardless...

Snipped and put into quote : From: &quot;Chris Slaymaker&quot;

&gt; One question:  Does your engine still have the thermostat/flaps installed?

Yes, both on my 78 Bus and on my 74' Westie.

&gt;....  Correct me if I'm wrong, but those with this configuration still a
part
&gt; of their engine probably do not have a problem with this issue.

Your corrected...
Both mine get this sludge regardless if I'm driving my bus' in the winter or
summer. And I am sure that the flaps are operational as well as the
thermostat.
And I have put over 14,000 km (closer to 19-20,000) on my 78' this past year
(nice long trips and cold, in the winter) and around 3500 miles (it has a
mph speedo)
on the westie. (They are hot enough to supposably burn off any moisture)
