Hey bussers,
	I ran into this guy who has some engines, trans and misc. parts he
needs to get rid of.  I don't know anything about him, I'm just passing
on the info.  He has 4 engines (all dual port 1600 I think) and a couple
IRS trans and some misc bug/buggy parts.  He's only looking to get $150
for everything.  His name is Steve Jensen and he's located in Port
Clinton, Ohio.  You can reach him at (419) 734-1965

That's all I know, so get a hold of him with any questions.

See you down the road,
