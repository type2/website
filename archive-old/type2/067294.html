Subject: This weekend trip

Greetings
I am excited but a little trip I  am taking this weekend that I thought I share.Well, while sitting and brewing over my atlas on somewhere close to go for a 
weekend trip my eyes came across the town of Lost Corner, AR. It sits in the 
Ozarks and is far away from any major highway or interstate. The only road
leading into this town is dirt/gravel and the only road out is the same. It 
seems like with a name like that it got to have some interesting history behind
it. With the luck I have it probaly just a trailerpark. We shall see though.
On another foot and note, On the recent subsriber who went to Hot Springs for 
his honeymoon, checked out your homepage and your dead list. Very impressive 
list. All tapes went out the door beneath my nose in a ex girlfriends arm. 
Peace from a tuneless bus

I had my stereo stolen out of my bus. aka no tunes In broad daylight even on 
campus busted the lock on my window with a butter knife. Oh well
