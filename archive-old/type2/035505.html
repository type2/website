Subject: Re: clutch update

the wing nut has a square-ish shape to it so that it fits into the square
end on the clutch arm.  you MUST not just go and turn the wing nut or you
will me turning/twisting the cable in its housing.  hold the cable still
with pliers/visegrips THEN turn the wing nut.  this explains why the clutch
goes clear to the floor.  you do NOT have it adjusted correctly.  you have
just twisted the cable.  thus the cable is still loose, and the clutch pedal
drops to the floor with ease.

make sense?

&gt;  of my foot. i can pull the cluch lever on the trans forward about an
&gt;  inch with my hand. is this normal? the new wingnut (which i ordered from
&gt;  my local VW dealer) dosent turn on the end of the cable to easily, im
&gt;  assumeing this is to prevent it form comeing off, but i really cant turn
&gt;  it down at all.. prier to all of this there were no unusual noises, i
