&gt; beautiful; well, maybe that's just me...?

Ok, I will (nicely, I hope) flame you. :)

My bus is usually covered with dust, full of junk, and generally a
little dishevelled.  This isn't because I don't love it, or because I
don't respect it, but because I'm too busy out _using_ it instead of
waxing it or some silliness like that.  I maintain the important
stuff; it's nearly rust-free, the engine runs well, and the interior
is cozy, if a little messy.  The thing isn't a show vehicle, and it
isn't supposed to be. 

Perhaps the ugliest bus I've ever seen belongs to my friend (and
helpful bus guru) Rick; he saved his '62 from the crusher and replaced
most everything mechanical about it.  It's primer gray, most of the
lenses are cracked, kinda rusty, various equipment bolted on to it,
the doors don't close quite right; but boy does he love the thing;
it's carried him for thousands of miles and hundreds of happy nights.
(If you're in Oregon and see his bus, say hello!)

Insert something about beauty being more than skin deep here... :)
