Subject: [T2] another 2.0 l engine teardown query


&gt; I'm now in the process of removing the heads to inspect and replace the
seals
&gt; (obvious leaks on both heads) but it seems that there is not enough room
to
&gt; get either the correct socket or a box end wrench in to loosen two of the
four
&gt; nuts without rubbing up against the rocker shaft. The Bentley says not to
&gt; disassemble the rocker shaft and to remove the heads with them in place.

I don't remember those instructions.  You certainly have to remove the
rockers to get at the head nuts.  Just keep everything in the correct order.
As you pull off on half of the rocker (there's 2 rocker assemblies per head)
slip some wire or string through the supports and shafts at both ends.  Then
label that assembly so you know where it goes.  If you take it apart for
cleaning keep things in their correct order.

&gt; Also, I'm feeling a little wary about reinstallation....do I want to
replace
&gt; the clutch plate while the engine is out? How do you check it?

The Bentley has procedures for checking the pressure plate and disk so you
can check to see if they're in spec.  Beyond that, it's a matter of
money/time/dread at having to pull the engine again, etc., etc.  Some people
advise changing these things everytime you pull the engine, others don't.
There aint no correct answer.

&gt; Do the
&gt; pushrods, tubes and seals need to be replaced?

Tubes certainly can be reused if they're not crushed or otherwise damaged.
Seals are fairly cheap and I'd advise replacing them as a matter of course.

&gt; What else should I look into
&gt; replacing/checking before reinstallation?

Don't know how far you're going in your teardown, but most anything that
*can* be replaced for as far as you go should be inspected.  If you've got
the flywheel and rear hub off than look at the seals.  If there's any signs
of leakage, replace them.  Seals for the oil cooler, likewise.  Any paper
gaskets that are exposed in the teardown (e.g., oil filler tube, oil filter
mounting, etc.) should be replaced.
