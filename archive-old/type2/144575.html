Subject: RE: [T2] Duncan's new bus (oops/power loss update)

Duncan, et al.,

D. is a new list member, so let's make things clear for him.

Duncan, if you're going to be parking this bus under shelter and working on it
till it gets painted, go ahead and leave the body work areas you work on
bare.

All I'm saying is, if you're doing bodywork/paint on a daily driver (like I am
right now), keep some kind of paint on it if you're driving around in UK
weather conditions or it will begin rusting on you.

Also, disregard the sarcasm about your efforts from listmembers who do
professionally what you are attempting as a do-it-yourselfer.

Billy's Current Garage Paint Procedure List
(1) Visualize future chromatic glory with artist's eye.
(2) Hand Sand with 150 grit to remove grime, rough it up a bit.
(3) Dust off with rag/brush.
(4) Hold Breath.
(5) Apply olive drab green hardware store spraypaint (in a professional
manner)
(6) Enjoy new color of bus with cold beverage.
(7) Do another panel next weekend, repeat.
