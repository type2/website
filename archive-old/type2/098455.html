Subject: Re: [T2] Bus junkyard north of Denver

Zoran, Craig,

Thank you.  Yes, the yard I was thinking of is Blakes in Erie, CO.  A
suggestion of a yard from Uncle Jerry set me to thinking of this place as
a possibility for finding a &quot;donor body&quot; for my '73.

                           Steve Dolan
