&gt;So the new engine is up and running.  First time ever tuning this bus so
naturally I consult my Haynes manual.  

Get a Bentley, compare info with Haynes, know far more than either one
alone can provide.

&gt;Step one for the CA emissions is to disconnect the idle control stabilizer
and plug the leads &gt;into each other.  I look high and low, finding only the
leads already bypassed and the dirt &gt;outline where the stabilizer used to
be.  The sum'b*tch PO had screwed me again. 

Not if you inspected the beast adequatly BEFORE you negotiated
purchase!!!!!!!!!!!! Did he forbid you inspection prior to purchase??????
If you shift blame to others for everything in your life that goes wrong,
you will repeat mistakes all your life.

&gt;Much like every other part (including the t-stat, air flaps, superfluous
#2&amp;3 motor mounts, and 3 &gt;pieces of random tin, etc...) this unit was seen
as &quot;not necessary&quot; by the backyard bonehead &gt;mechanic who had serviced it
in the past. Anyway, no big surprise.  My question is: how important &gt;is
the idle control stabilizer unit?  How long can i drive around with it
bypassed? 

Stock is best, and best to confirm this by inspection before purchase. When
I bought my T-II, I saw it on the street with a For Sale sign. In a 5
minute inspection I determined that all the glass was stock and in good
order save for the aftermarket cracked windshield, the only juris rigus
noted was the radio wiring which could be easily corrected, and the motor
was stock as to proper fasteners in the proper places with worn out stock
carbs with stock vaccuum pipes and stock distributor with tight shaft and
Bosch parts. At that point I to contacted the owner to obtain permission to
do a proper complete inspection. If I had seen a Weber progressive
conversion on there with 009 dizzy and poor cooling air seals I would have
walked away having wasted only a few minutes of time. It would take over a
$1000 in time/money to correct just that much.
 
&gt;-Also, WTB elec. pigtails?  i have several that are very brittle and
cracked and need replacement but they do not seem to be avail thru Bus
depot or Van Again. I especially need the plug which goes into the
distributor---what years is this specific to in case i need to visit local
recycler?

The easy replacement of quality for standard terminals is the marine grade
stuff commonly available. The 2 pin FI and sensor pigtails with new boot
seals are available new for 6 or 8 bucks from specialty suppliers or any
Bosch Authorized Parts Spezialist (BAPS). The distributor connector might
be available from a VW dealer if they don't puke when you say &quot;...for a
T-II.&quot;  If there is a Bosch number on it, it may as well be available
through BAPS. Inspect any used connectors closely. They are just as old and
hard and crack prone as the one you have that has failed. Similar/same
connnectors were used on many of the water cooled VW production of the same
era. That's why I think it likely that the dealers can get the part if they
want to. 

&gt;-Since you're reading this anyway, can anybody recommend a good tachometer?

None is stock because it's not needed. The horsepower on these motor drops
through the basement before you reach overrev unless you hold it to the
floor on a down grade. If you consider this a needed enhancement, VDO is
proven German quality. If you want to go to something custom, consider
adapting your instrument pod with Porsche instruments of your era. That
sure won't give you a 7000+ redline, but it sure would put RPM in your face
up front and center which is CRITICAL for a Porsche and stock on every one
ever produced, but superfalouse for a T-II and not even available as a
stock option on them for every one ever produced.
