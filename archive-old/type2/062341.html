Subject: Africa Stories?

I don't know if anyone's interested, but I have a friend that I just
discovered something new about. In the late 70's, turns out he was quite
the type 2 fanatic. He's a Brit, and spent 10 months and 15,000 miles
driving from northern Africa to South Africa (sometimes only 80-90 miles
a day, because of the roughness) in a '63 Kombi. He's got gobs of
stories to tell of his trip, pictures, advice, etc. He's driven
apparently everywhere in Europe and most places in Africa in the buss,
and would love to share his stories.

If anyone thinks it would be worthwile, I'd be more than happy to put
some of these pix and stories in readable fashion, and put them on my HP
or somewhere available.

If it's something anyone would care to hear about, let me know. I was
fascinated, and this guy has more hidden knowledge than most I've met.
