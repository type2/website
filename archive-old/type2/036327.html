Subject: Felt ring/needle bearing

List,

Might someone know if the little felt ring that goes in the end of the type4
flywheel is available?

It seems to be like 'hen's teeth' locally...

Also, the Bentley seems to suggest that there ought to be a needle bearing in
the flywheel. There is one in the crank, but not in the flywheel.  Should
there be?

Is there an easier way to pull the bearing from the crank than cutting the
race and collapsing it?

TIA,
Clark
