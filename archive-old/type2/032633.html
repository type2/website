Subject: Re: oil light associated with tight valves?/hnydrtaulic lifters

Re 79 with hydraulic lifters that got worse when you tightened them....
Chattery at times?  Typical if they drained out the oil in the lifter
when hot  and take time to pump up when cold.   A lot of miles can cause
the lifter to drain more readily.  You don't adjust hydraulics like
solid lifters- the piston in the lifter has a fair amount of free play
(like 2 mm) and you must adjust the lifter so at running temperature the
piston is still within the range of free play.
Typically this is done when the engine is cold, and you back up the
adjustor until you know it's no longer in contact with the valve stem,
and then turn it back in until you just feel it contacting the stem. 
Doesn't matter if lifter is pumped up (pull the rocker and if you feel
&quot;spongieness&quot; it's likely drained)...Then go in 2 more turns.  If during
your &quot;adjustment&quot; you didn't back them out but went in one turn, you may
have turned them into &quot;solid lifters&quot; (no play in the piston) if they
were on the tight side to begin with -and consequentially have too tight
valves that get tighter when the engine is hot and thus may not close
completely....not good from standpoint of letting the valve cool.  This
could indeed affect compression and power.
   As to what you mean &quot;the valves never let go of the oil pressure&quot;
when you tightened them..???..if you turned them into solid lifters, the
oil pressure is irrelevant!   The oil is pumped via the hole in the side
of the lifter in under the piston to pressurize it;  and then there is
the center hole of the piston that feeds to the side of the piston.  I
assume this is to allow some oil to lubricate the pushrod end and
provide a route for oil circulation.  
   As to your oil light not coming on after stopping and
restarting....????possibly oil pressure is being held somewhere
(unlikely), or your gauge is blocked in some way....as long as it comes
on (works to show NO pressure and then goes out (pressure)...you should
be OK.  Best insurance is to put a pressure gauge off a T on the stock
sender.
