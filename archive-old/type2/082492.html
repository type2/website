I've got the same mounting, although I put the pod a little closer to the driver.  Great mounting location, I drilled one extra hole, ran the wires through the speaker 
grille as Bob did.  The VDO pod has angled holes so the gauges face the driver.  Dash-top mounting does slightly obstruct your view, but only the very lowest edge 
of it.  Looks honkin' huge when you first install it but after a while not so much.
