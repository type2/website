Subject: Re: [T2] engine won't go in

Did you use a clutch alignment tool when you put the pressure plate and
clutch disc on? If the clutch disc is even off 1mm to one side, it will not
mate up. Check that the clutch disc is absolutely centred in the pressure
plate. The alignment tools are about 2 bucks from most sources.
HTH,
Courtney

Subject: [T2] engine won't go in


&gt; This Spring, I pulled a 1600DP from my '71 Westy to rebuild it.
&gt; While doing the rebuild, I bought another 1600DP  from a fellow in
&gt; another state. I did a quick top end rebuild but used the flywheel
&gt; and clutch assembly that came with the second one.
&gt;
&gt; Today was to have been the big day to put this one into the bus. It
&gt; won't go.   It goes to within say 3/4&quot; of full mating with the bell
&gt; housing, but no further. No amount of wiggling the engine or rotating
&gt; the pulley would make it go.
&gt;
&gt; I rolled the engine back into the garage and compared the
&gt; flywheel/clutch assembly with the one from the original engine.  The
&gt; only difference I can see is that the original pressure plate is the
&gt; type that has  many fingers that contact the release bearing. The new
&gt; plate has a solid ring that evidently makes this contact.
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone suggest why I can't get the engine to mate?
&gt; Is the difference in pressure plates significant?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks, Jack
