&gt; I have often wondered why someone with a great deal more money than
&gt; me hasn't repaired a bay or splittie body to perfection and used it to make
&gt; fiberglass
&gt; molds for new fiberglass bodies.

The prospect of spending five figures on molds and then getting a Cease
and Desist letter (or worse) from VWoA might stifle that idea.

Also, stiff fiberglass bodies are not much lighter than steel.  Yes,
lightweight racing fiberglass parts are light, but they lack the strength
of the original steel parts.  Corvettes are made of fiberglass, but they
are not all that light.
