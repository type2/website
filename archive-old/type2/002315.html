Hello Norm,
The semi-auto-stickshift is a kind of auto tranny for the beetle and the
karmann Type 14 only.
You have 3 gears (plus reverse), one for hills, one for city-use (0-50 mph),
one for freeways.
No clutch pedal, when you touch the stickshift, the work is done
electropneumatic. A torque-converter
allows to start and stop in every gear. Strange solution, especially
designed for low hp engines as the beetles.
The Auto-Busses were always equipped with fully autos (self shifting), the
advert must be wrong.

I'm just coming home from a long sunday trip with my 73 super-beetle auto
semi stickshift. You love it or you hate it. I love it.
So does my wife. No acelleration, but easy to use. Previous owner was born
in 1909.....

If godfather wanted us driving shifters, he had given us three legs.

Best wishes

&gt;Hello.

&gt;What exactly is a 'semi-automatic transmission'?

&gt;I've read an advert for a 72 van with one of these, but I've never hear
&gt;of one...

&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Norm Gall
