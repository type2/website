Note the inflation pressure.

I don't have the ETRTO book available at home, but max load rating at 44 psi
probably exceeds 1520 lbs (1547 maybe?).

These tires are rated for a maximum inflation pressure of 44 psi.


(snip)
: In your posting the maximum load for the Continental reinforced tires
: was stated as 1477 lbs _at_42 psi.  The manual for my '71 specifies a
: load rating of 1520 pounds.  Did the load rating requirement go down
: when VW switched from bias to radial tires?
