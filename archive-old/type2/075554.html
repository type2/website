Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Pump for a 78

P. S.  Only my dad is allowed to slam me publicly,
like you just did.  And that is even up to question.

Maybe bus ownership gives us all a different way of
looking at things.

I can guarantee you that I have had many more
experiences packed into these 28 years than many
people twice my age.

PS, help me fix my pump!!

Mark

&gt; Not even Bosch can rebuild a Bosch FI fuel pump.
&gt; Watch out for that $127
&gt; rebuild by who????? If you want the most money when
&gt; your 60, pay the price
&gt; for a new Bosch pump now. Compromise is great risk
&gt; of pain for your wallet. 
&gt; 
&gt; You wallet just ain't deep enough to carry the
&gt; freight??? Bust ass, get an
&gt; evening part time job. If you ain't got enough
&gt; time/money to make it work
&gt; for sure, how do you justify throwing away money on
&gt; cheap?????? 
&gt; 
&gt; Hit a junkyard, take your chances. Look for a
&gt; possible newer replacement
&gt; pump on a ratty chassis. Sometimes you get lucky.
&gt; The risk is quick failure
&gt; of an old pump that has been inactive for more than
&gt; a year. Might work a
&gt; week, might work for an hour, might not work at all.
&gt; You risk all with
&gt; hopin' and guessin'. You risk nothing with a new
&gt; Bosch pump, if you install
&gt; it correctly, and put in a new filter to insure
&gt; results. 
&gt; 
&gt; Criminy, if you can afford 5 vehicles, two of which
&gt; are less than 4 years
&gt; old,  how is it you can't afford a new pump, how is
&gt; it you can afford to
&gt; throw money at squeeky cheap on the VW so's you can
&gt; make the mortgage
&gt; payments on the newer rides,????

&gt; &gt;Fellow Bus owners:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I have figured out that my fuel pump is locked up
&gt; or
&gt; &gt;something. I took it out and it whirs, but it will
&gt; not
&gt; &gt;pull gas.  Is there a way of fixing it?  Paying
&gt; $127~
&gt; &gt;for a rebuilt pump is out of my league right now. 
&gt; I
&gt; &gt;have bid on one on Ebarf and some guy bids it up
&gt; &gt;higher.  Anyways, anybody have a used one for sale
&gt; for
&gt; &gt;cheap, That works?  Can I cut mine open, free the
&gt; &gt;obstruction or rust, and have my room mate tig weld
&gt; it
&gt; &gt;back together?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Any Ideas? Any Help?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks
&gt; &gt;
