&gt; I believe you'll find a picture in Bentley showing the hose attaching
&gt; to the intake of the air cleaner.

I have never seen an intact example of this system but the original
crossover pipe on the early fuel injection models had a jacket
wrapped around it with two pipes leading up through the tin.  Hoses
attached to these then led warm air to the intake manifold.

It appears, Jason, that you have the partial remains of this system.  Look
at your exhaust.  If you have the original crossover pipe with jacket then
you have a rare bird indeed. If you have no inlet on your air filter box
then it was replaced at some time.

If anyone has the complete system in its original configuration I would
love to see pictures.

                             OOK!
