Subject: engine rebuild

Hi All!
I am currently an owner of a '78 type II Westy, and need to pull the engine 
and tranny. Can they be pulled together in one piece? Need to replace tranny, 
and while I am at it, an engine overhaul wouldn't hurt. Any assistance would 
be nice. particularly, how to get it out. Thanks.
