Subject: Re: 1800 into 80 van -feasability? (long babble)
Message-ID: &lt;4cf73ad7.2499cccb_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

In a message dated 99-06-10 23:42:59 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; Now the '78 is essentially the
 same engine the Vanagon has, with an unfortunate difference (well the 1800
 has the same problem) the heads in buses (except '79) use &quot;round&quot; exhaust
 ports with little copper ring gaskets, the Vanagon uses &quot;square&quot; ports with
 metal/asbestos gaskets.  So you aren't going to be able to bolt the Vanagon
 exhaust, and hence the Vanagon heating system to either bus motor.   &gt;&gt;

Yeah, I ran into this problem originally back when I thought I knew how to do 
something.
 The Previous Owners tale was this: It had gotten a bad oil change at a Jiffy 
Lube in Arizona, the oil drained loose, frying the case. A 'gex' longblock 
(CV engine) was shipped to general delivery and the blown case was put in the 
back seat. It's condition at the time I bought it; started and ran but 
pouring white smoke into the interior, diagnosis from the local garage 'the 
heads warped'  I bought the bus with blown motor and extra fried case 
(canadian rebuild) for $350 in 91 near Rochester New York in the dead winter. 
the bus had 212k on it. 

being a fan of my 77s mechanical lifters, I wanted the same for my 80. (yeah, 
I know) so I took someones advice who said I could work the switch without 
splitting the case, leaving the hydralic 80 cam and running solid lifters. I 
bought new mechanical lifters and pushrods for a solid lifter bus, and sent 
the two best vanagon heads to Rimco for rebuilding. They explained to me that 
the valve springs were different for mechanical (either more stiff or less 
stiff) can't remember,  and they switched them for use on a mechanical lifter 
engine, rebuilt the heads and redid the valve seats on all of the valves and 
I remember it cost about $500 for both. I remember putting it together and 
the valve train geometry being messed up; you know washers under the rocker 
shafts to get the right valve clearance, things that deeply troubled me but 
being courageous I continued trying different sets of pushrods until I 
settled on a 3rd pair of 1700 ones. I ran the motor. I ended up putting 10k, 
somehow, on the van. It had that smell of burnt oil death at all times, and 
the idle was probably near 2000 at idle and no amount of fuel injection 
fiddling would bring it down.
Upset I went back to Rimco and they redid them for free. I don't know what 
happened exactly because the Co2 was probably getting into the cab, but  At 
the end I discovered that i screwed up and had accidently put the hydralic 
lifters in there - so I had a hydralic cam/lifters but mechanical push rods, 
valve springs (Quality Control has always been an issue) and I think I took 
the heads off at that point and discovered the seats dropping again. 


So as an aside, what's the deal with interchange between hydralic vs. solid 
cams, etc.? can you run a 78-80 hydralic cam with solid lifters? Is the 
hydralic a lower duration cam and what's the difference? less power? Less 
cooling time for the valves? 

So, my plan then is to use the 78 case, and use the exhaust and best set of 
heads I have. Just was concerned about the compatability on the clutch area, 
but I guess the answer is the 78 and 80 are the same clutch and it will mesh 
with the shaft.

thanks for the previous comments, and any to come.
