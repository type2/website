Subject: Re: [T2] '72 - '75 engine tin part needed

Try Joe at BustedBus (BustedVW?) He found used tin for me that I'd been
needing to replace for years;  reasonable price and great quality. (Hard to
believe that it was used!)

Highly recommended.

&gt; I'm replacing the passenger side heat exchanger and I need the little
piece
&gt; of tin that attaches to the heat exchanger and the fan housing.  It bolts
to
&gt; the top of the heater box right where it to connects to the fan housing.
&gt; P-mail if you can help.  Pay cash or trade for parts.
&gt;
&gt; I think mine fell off when the heater box let loose.
&gt;
&gt; This is the last heater box I had from the secret asbestos recall a couple
of
&gt; years back.  The pipes on both sides failed where they are press fit into
the
&gt; cast fittings that bolt to the heads?  Otherwise the boxes are in
excellent
&gt; shape.
&gt;
&gt; I tried having the drivers side welded, but the heat distorted the pipes
and
&gt; they wouldn't line up.  Anyone else have this same problem with their free
&gt; heater boxes?
