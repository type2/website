Well, I stuck with the old Prodigy until it spun off  Prodigy Internet, and
now have both (6 ID's!!) for 19.95 a mo.  While AOL is going up in price,
Prodigy Internet announced it would drop to $15.95 if you paid for the
year.  Rated actually by PC Computing as best of the mass providers, since
you don't wait for dialups- they rated AOL worst!  Gives you choice of
Netscape or Explorer.  Works for me....
