Subject: RE: turn signals don't work!

Ken,
  This would be a good one as it is a common problem. I had the
same problem on my 74 and it was a flakey bulb socket. 
  However, I didnt use the meter as when I moved the bulb around in
the socket it went on an off,,,,kind of a no brainer. Most of the time,
when I am looking at a intermittent electrical. I jiggle the
wire/component 
around. I start at the connector an stablize the rest of the wire (most
of
intermittent problems are where the wire is crimped/soldered to a
connector,
or a receptacle such as a bulb socket that is subject to humidity or
vibration)
if the problem is not at the connector I work my way down the wire while
stablizing
the connector, flexing small sections of the wire.
   If the problem is not intermittent,,,,well I break out the ole
multimeter.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
&gt; (Daniel, one of the problems I noticed in my few adventures with the
&gt; digi
&gt; multimeter is that it can't measure turn signals because the pulses
&gt; come
&gt; too fast. All I can get it to do is blink &quot;L&quot;. So it's indicating
&gt; voltage
&gt; in a binary way which is what you wanted, really. 8)
&gt; 
If you are useing a digital multi. for checking a pulsed DC signal like
turn
signals and the frequency response of your meter isnt fast enough then
it
will give the same indication that you might get if you are slipping on
and off
a contact with a very low stray voltage.
  However with a analog (needle) readout you will see the needle deflect
in
a specific beat frequency,,,it may not give you a accurate voltage
readout
as the meter movement may not be fast enough to reach peak input voltage
------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------
The wire here is the original,,I would check the spade connector/wire
interface.
&gt; If it is corrosion, it's on the spade connector in the box and I
&gt; &gt;wouldn't be able to clean it. The turn signal unit is a new one as of
&gt; &gt;3 months ago, so it's clean.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
If you shorted it out I would think the fuse is toast.
&gt; &gt;Yes, it is the wire running to the little clear box. I reconnected it
&gt; &gt;and still nothing. Do you suppose I may have shorted something out?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------
I hosed my sockets clean with WD-40, then 409 to clean off
the residual WD. There is a connector cleaner you can get at
FLAPS which cleans and coats to prevent corrosion but WD works
well for cleaning the real serious build-ups. 409 cuts the WD real well
and further cleans the dirt,,,,Undo your ground strap while messing
around here though.
&gt; Actually it is highly likely to be corroded in the brake light pod,
&gt; either
&gt; at the push-on spade connectors or inside where the little contacts
&gt; actually touch the bulb. It gets very grody in there and I'm always
&gt; surprised that anybody's brake lights work at all. 8)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- ----------------------------
Anyway, anyone that would have time to check my Multimeter primer
page for bugs,,,,,flame on!

 Per Ken's suggestion I will put up a digital read-out meter page too.
Thanks, Ken!
