Subject: Re: [T2] fuel tank sender install was gauge won't go to 1/1

Christopher,

My suggestion would be drill a pilot hole and then use a jig saw to cut 
the panel out.  Both cuts, in mine and in my friend's, were three sided 
- about 4&quot; to 5&quot; per side.  I cut mine off completely and made a trap 
door - too much free time at work ;-) .

The tank sits about 4&quot; below the panel but still use a short blade.  On 
the two tanks I've seen the wire's laid pretty flat against the tank but 
use caution.  Use of a dye grinder (Dremel style) tends to spark a lot.  

There is ALWAYS a fire risk so use you gray fleshy matter between your 
ears when doing this.  Follow the usual safety procedures.

This is a pretty easy job.  Good luck.
