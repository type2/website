Hi all-
Geez, didn't mean to start such a discussion!
Let me clarify my situation. I'm rebuilding a 1600 for my 71 Camper. Cam is
worn, lifters shot, pushrods have odd wear pattern on the shafts, adjusters
are worn. SO, I'm going to replace the whole shebang.
Question is (assuming I replace all of the above with specifically hydraulic
parts), what fits? Being new to VWs, I don't know what engine these came as
standard on, what to ask for, or where to get it.
Seeing as I'm now down to bare cases and and am prepared to bite the
financial bullet, so to speak, I'm interested in building a reliable,
hopefully long-lived, stock displacement single carb engine.
Hope I was clearer about my situation.

TIA,

Tom
