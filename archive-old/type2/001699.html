Hi!

After pulling the engine in my 72 (which has a 74/75?  1800 carb engine) I
found that a Valve guide dropped did very light damage...(really!)  I've
replaced it...and now have a list of things I'm going to do with the
engine...(rebuild a new one from scratch for starters ;-)  )  but After I
put it all together, and re adjusted my rocker arms for a second time...one
came loose :(      It's running beautiful....   BUT (and there always is)
the seals on the push rod tubes appears not to be working at all....they of
course leak down onto the exhaust manifold, and into the heater boxes.  I
had to disconnect my heater to keep from fixating on the fumes.   Any Ideas
on the 'best' way of installing these o-rings?  any trick to them I missed?
These are brand new...the inner o-rings (ones near the crankcase) work
fine...

Thanks
Patrick
