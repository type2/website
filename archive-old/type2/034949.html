Subject: 1962 Split screen Kombi or Standard wanted

Hi!

I am looking to buy a 1962 or earlier Kombi or Standard. I want it to be 
stock, or as close as possible. 1200 engine.  It must run perfect to make the 
trip back to maine, and then when I graduate, I'll be moving out to Oregon.  
Please mail me with what you got. I want it to have absolutly no rust and no 
accident damage. Is it possible?

I live in maine, but I will travel anywheres in the US to pick it up. 

Thanks!
Matt
