Subject: Elastic cord and crimper ring source?

Anyone have a source for the elastic cord used on Westies to hold the bottom
of the curtain?  Also the metal rings to crimp it after folding.  I've
searched the net and can find the cord in black, but no rings.  Any suggestion
were to get this?  I've tried the local fabric store and Wal-Mart.

Found a webpage that sells the cords premade, but for $60, thought I could
make my own cheaper.
