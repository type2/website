Subject: Re: [T2] Coos Bay Oregon

It's really very nice there.  I bought my sailboat up in Washington and Coos Bay was my only stop down the coast.  Very nice folks there really helped me out getting my autopilot bracket fixed.
But, I really think where ever you move to you will never be without parts.  With the amount of people you have helped out over the years, all you would have to do is just post a parts wanted and I'm sure you would have what ever you needed.

I am contemplating moving there, but it would mean the end of good used parts once I run out of my stash
