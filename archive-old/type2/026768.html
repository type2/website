&gt;Also, my engine hangs off my transmission that hangs off a bracket that sits

&gt;rubber mount or of what size is it (I can't tell with the engine in)?  Has
&gt;anyone played with these rubber mounts within memory?

Replace the broken one. Period. Pull the tranny, replace the mount. Your vehicle, I found from experience, is not safe with broken tranny mounts. Especially replace the front mount, since you will have the tranny out. You loose the ability to control steering at high speeds if your front tranny mount goes out. If your back tranny mount is broken, your front will likely go soon. I'd replace all of them, without question!

You can get tranny mounts at any decent FLAPS or at my favorite MOPP (Mail Order Parts Place)--www.busdepot_dot_com--the Bus Depot. You should be able to order it by specifying the year of your bus. They are pretty standard sizes.

Thanks! Joe
