&gt; &gt; &gt; Just how loudly could I scream for 7 seconds of panic stop, all (hopefully)
&gt; &gt; &gt; four wheel pealing rubber, and the object of my attention drawing closer to
&gt; &gt; &gt; my front wheels with every second??
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;A locked up wheel will not stop a vehicle, i.e. four wheel pealing rubber. And
&gt; &gt;you have no steering control. That is the main reason for Anti-lock brakes. To
&gt; &gt;keep you from locking up the wheels and losing steering control. One of the
&gt; &gt;benefits was shorter stopping distances.
&gt;
&gt; An article I read explained that a sliding tire on a smooth surface
&gt; (pavement) actually slides further because the bits and pieces of the tire
&gt; that rub off ball up and cause the tires to slide on little rubber balls -
&gt; - just like an eraser on paper. Slide you finger over a pile of eraser
&gt; debris and see if the friction of your finger against paper doesn't go down.
&gt;
&gt; Sliding is better though at slow speeds on dirt and gravel b/c of the small
&gt; pile of debris that builds up in front of the tire and helps stop the vehicle.

For most materials, the coefficient of sliding friction is less than the
coefficient of static friction.  The non-sliding tire &quot;holds onto&quot; the
tiny irregularities  in surfaces better than a sliding tire.
