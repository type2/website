Subject: replacement long blocks
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I need to replace my 2000 cc long block for a '79 bus.  I
have found two different suppliers on the net.  Living in
Hawaii there are no other options than shipping from the
mainland.

I would like any positive or negative about the two
suppliers as to make the best choice on long block to get. 
They are &quot;GEX&quot; and &quot;AVP&quot; both from California.

Has anyone had any experience with either?

Any other suggestions on long block replacement that I have
not considered?

Thanks for your input.

Bradley Pierce
Maui, Hawaii.
