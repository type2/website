Subject: 12-point tools info: from recent experience

Technical Name:(according to the Snap-On Tool guy who never showed up after
4 hours of my trying to hook up)(that's me going out of my way to meet
him)(can you tell I'm pissed at the Snap-On guy):  Twelve-point Spline Tool

Availability: Snap-On (maybe)  NAPA auto parts (about $8) Also, I've heard,
but not confirmed, that Sears sells a version.  My local sears could never
even figure out what I was talking about.  Neither could the Grainger guy.
At NAPA, tell 'em it's for a VW.  It'll speed up their figuring out what
you're talking about.

Sizing:  CV joints: 8 mm.  Yes, I know a 6mm hex fits in there, but its an
8mm Spline Tool.  Automatic Drive Plate: 12mm.  A 10mm hex key is too big,
a 9mm hex key too small.  A 12mm spline tool is juuuuuuust right.

Use: more torque than you can get any other way.  And hardly any strippage.
In fact, it's too bad in IMHO that these tools/bolts didn't replace Allen
keys/bolts.  In the case of the drive plate, there appears to be no other
option.

There you have it.  Good luck.

Eric and Maggie
