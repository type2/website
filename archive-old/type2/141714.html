How in the world is one supposed to know what's domestic and what's not? Most ot the Japanese carmakers build at least some of their cars here in US. And &quot;American&quot; cars are built in Canada, Mexico, central and South America. _at_0 years ago my Mom bought a Pontiac cuz she wanted to Support American workers. Some time later she found out that it was actully assembeld somewhere in South America.
