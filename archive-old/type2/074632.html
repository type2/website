Subject: NEW- Genuine Bus Scissors Jack  (and 85 cent hubcap puller)!

I have a new item that I think will be useful to many of you. This is a
genuine VW jack that uses your Bus's stock jack points. But rather than an
&quot;upright&quot; jack like the one that came with your bus, this is a &quot;scissors&quot;
type jack like the ones included with the Golf, Jetta, etc.  This is the
same jack that's included with the present-day VW busses sold in Brazil and
Mexico.

This is a much more stable jack than the one included with your bus - much
safer when changing a tire on the side of the road.  I also use two of them
to level my bus while camping.  By raising two of the four corners just a
tiny bit (lifting the suspension just an inch or two; not taking the wheels
off the ground) I can make my camper much more comfortable to sleep in when
parked on a slight grade.

The price is just $34.95.  Part number 237 011 031 .  There's a picture at
http://199.217.241.240/octpartsimages/237-011-031.JPG .

Also, I now have VW hubcap pullers. This is the little palm-sized tool that
came with your bus when it was new (but is probably long gone by now). The
two prongs stick into the two small holes along the rim of your chrome
hubcaps, and you just pull with your finger to remove the hubcap. (Yes,
that's what those little holes are for!)  No more scratching your wheels or
hubcaps by prying them off with a tire iron or screwdriver!  (Note: check
your hubcaps first; some aftermarket ones lack the little holes along the
rim.)  They're genuine VW, and just 85 cents. Part number 211 012 243 .
