For cooking inside the camper (which for me means making coffee or 
boiling water for soup), I use a butane one-burner stove, badged 
&quot;Kenyon,&quot; that I got from West Marine. Price is $59.95 US. The same 
cooker is packaged by Reimo, of Germany, into their low-end campers, so 
this cooker is certainly available in Europe. It uses butane canisters 
and has a variety of safety features. Of course these are only as safe as 
the canister itself. Piezo lighter built into the control knob. Very 
smooth. 

For real cooking I carry a Coleman dual-fuel stove and I cook outside. In 
principle, then, I could cook a three-burner meal. I find the sound and 
the odor of a stove of this type to be an essential part of the camping 
experience. Reminds me of my old but beloved Svea.
