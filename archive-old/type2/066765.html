Hello friends -
In my recent trials and tribulations concerning a coil and towing, I
witnessed the tow truck driver behaving in a curious manner, he pulled
over to allow the three vehicles behind pass by.  While not a legal
requirement, it was courtesy, plain and simple, while NONE of the 
people shown this courtesy returned even a slight wave.  Time for
some good old fashioned schoolin'.

Following is a short course in behaving in a courteous manner whilst
driving.  Herewith are presented some of the actions, gestures, and
behaviors that will distinguish you, the driver of a Volkswagen bus,
from the rest of the masses (beyond the lofty status you attain by
being a bus owner!).

Courtesy 101

1) Use your turn signals to allow others to anticipate your actions.
Signals are to inform others of your intentions, not to say where
you've been.

2) When being passed, hold your speed constant, do NOT try and *help*
the passing vehicle.  It is the passer's responsibility to time the
passing speed &amp; traffic.  By changing your speed the passing vehicle
owner cannot predict where you will be.  However, this being said,
be prepared for evasive maneuvers in case passing vehicle totally
blows it, uh, um, fails to properly execute the passing maneuver.

3) When a passing vehicle has passed sufficiently to be able to return
to your lane, signal them that it is clear by briefly turning OFF your
lights (at night) or briefly turning them ON during daylight.

4) When a passing vehicle is NOT in a safe position to change lanes,
signal this condition by using your high beams briefly, or repeatedly.

5) When driving slower than normal traffic, and vehicles are lined up
behind you, pull over, where safe, to let them pass by.  Signal your
intentions by waving them around with your arm, or using your right
turn signal (except in those left side countries).  In some places
this is a legal requirement when there are 5 or more behind you.

6) In the unlikely event (remember you are driving a VW bus) that you
have passed someone that has behaved courteously towards you, thank
them by briefly turning your lights OFF at night, or by waving back to
them in daylight (and not the one fingered salute).  Remember this is
a class in courtesy, rude behavior is taught out there in the streets.

Using these few simple courteous actions will make driving safer, more
pleasant, and help elevate the society in which we live.  Truckers are
one group that generally knows these actions, appreciate the gestures
of courtesy, and will return them in kind.

Besides, it is not expected, and that, in and of itself,
is reason enough.

And now, go out there and be COURTEOUS ! ! ! ! ! Class dismissed.
