Subject: Re: [T2] Hydraulics versus solids, in an EFI engine

Not sure where the HP &quot;curve&quot; may have occured, but the GD (Solid Lifter)
and GE (Hyd Lifter) 2.0 were both rated at 70HP in the VAG Survey.  In fact,
the ED 1.8 (Late 74-75) w/EFI was also rated at 70HP, whereas the AW
1.8(Carbureted) was rated at 68HP.

&gt; Just to quell a questioning mind, was there a difference in HP, between an
&gt; EFI
&gt; motor with solids, and a similar EFI motor with hydraulics, or did the HP
&gt; &quot;curve&quot; occur at a different RPM?  Thanks
