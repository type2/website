Subject: Florida Caravan to High Country Bus Festival

Some people have expressed interest in getting a travel group to go from
Florida to North Carolina for High Country. This is my tentative itinerary:
Leave Orlando around 5pm on July, 27th
Arrive and spend the night at Crooked River State Park in Southern Georgia
http://www.gastateparks_dot_org/dnr/parks/ (then click on &quot;PARKS &amp; HISTORIC
SITES&quot; at the top of the left hand menu bar, then select &quot;Crooked River
Park&quot; from the selection box). I've never been there and would appreciate
any input from anyone who has or knows of another place in the area that
would make a good night-over spot.
It is approximately 450 miles from this park to Grandfather Mountain, which
I plan on driving on Friday. I typically would drive the interstate, but my
Rand McNally program can plot a scenic drive also.
I will have to drive back on Sunday since I need to work on Monday.
Let me know if your interested.
