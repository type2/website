Follow-up on this...

Today my engine is going in the mail, I hope it will be here this time next
week.

Beetlemex did indeed work out a way to ship the engine with UPS -- so my
cost to my door is $1050 and some pennies.  It would have been $100 more to
go with the trucking company.

I hope that it goes better then Dan's shipment to Indiana.  Based on my
research, mostly on the VINTAGVW list, Dan's experience is somewhat typical
of poor packaged longblock shipping via UPS.  Damange is typically one or
more of:  a) valve covers dented, b) head studs bent a little, c) oil cooler
damaged.  My thoughts are that better packing should get these issues
resolved...  The oil cooler is the most expensive part, if it comes damaged
I'm going to suggest to Beetlemex that they always ship this separate...
I've not heard anyone complain of more serious shipping damage...

I decided to go with solid lifters.  Most due to the fact that I like to get
the feedback when I do valve adjustments to see how things are going.
Besides, on a clean engine that I intend to keep clean -- I won't mind doing
them :)

P.S.  I wanted to publicly thank Brent Jarvi for a recent purchase.  He
shipped a carb as identified, packaged perfectly and a great price.  He
shipped it so quickly that I was two days behind in getting the check out to
him!  Great guy, don't hesitate to purchase long distance from him.  Check
in mail, I promise :)
