&gt; Maybe he just plays a doctor on TV. As far as a
&gt; straight points
&gt; replacement ie pertronix the unit costs about 50.00
&gt; and is warranteed to
&gt; work for 18 months i figured before that the cost of
&gt; tune up parts in an
&gt; equivalent time for me driving 250-300 miles a week
&gt; was about the same.

Yep, this is true. HOWEVER....I bought/installed a
Pertronix unit on my '69 Westy and the first unit
failed out of the box. I returned it for another and
it worked, but the timing was no longer correct. I had
to set the timing *way* advanced for it to idle/run
properly.

I ran it for about 2 months and finally pulled it back
out and switched back to points....I really didn't
like running it that far advanced.

I'll stick with what the factory recommends from now
on.


Also, I've never had to &quot;change my points on the side
of the road on a dark, rainy night&quot;, either. In fact,
I've never had them go out at all. Maybe it's because
I replace them before they get to that point.


Just my .02....

&gt; the big difference is no point swapping or dwell
&gt; adjustments for that 18
&gt; months. If points were so good they would still be
&gt; using them. 
&gt; 
&gt; in response to folks writing thusly::
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;I want to replace my *ordinary* ignition with an
&gt; electronic one...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think the good dokter...has a real good
&gt; point...maybe you missed it.......
&gt; &gt; &gt;Let's see. How many sets of points can we get for
&gt; $300????????????
&gt; &gt; Stock system..in good tune...no need to change....
&gt; &gt; I dunno..you do the math....
&gt; &gt; how many points/ign parts can u buy for $300 + 
&gt; dollars..
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; well i did the math and CDI etc is not equivalent to
&gt; points replacement.
