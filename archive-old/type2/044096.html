Hi Tom and Dana,

Sounds like your Hammurabi is the last of the air
cooleds.  Some oil pressure lights come on at 10 psi,
some as low as 4.5 psi, so no oil light doesn't mean
great pressure.  However, I'm getting the feeling that
all air cooled VWs run OK even with low hot idle oil
pressure.  Unless AVP bragged about how great theirs
was, I'd forget about it, drive it, and enjoy.  

Rob
