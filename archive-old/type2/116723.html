Subject: Interior roofing - Pictures and detailed description

&gt;Hi James,
&gt;
&gt;I think It would help if you can post a link to the roofing material you 
&gt;are planning on using.

Good idea
&gt;
&gt;Somehow people have the idea you want to use common T-Bar 24&quot;x48&quot; 
&gt;WAFERBOARD tiles.

My apologies.. I hadn't thought there might be some confusion but I spose
over the years different materials have been used. This stuff is basically 
pink
insulation pressed and formed (a glue maybe in with the fibre) about 1/2&quot; 
thick.
Basically a 2x4' panel of fibre insulation. Then on one side it has a white 
layer
with a pattern (variable ones available).


Here's a detailed explanation with pictures. Yes, I went to the parking lot
outside of work a minute ago with a camera and snapped these off. Now on
my server.

My van : http://www.firestrike_dot_net/van/yellowduckie.jpg
The kids named it so don't make fun lol ;)

The panel I am using for the roof.

Hot glue the stuff to the roof:

(You can see the front with the original material covering which is looking 
yellowish from age - hard to see in this pic)

Use white 1/8th white board similar to what i used with the front right kick
panel (I need to redo it, it was a test project)
http://www.firestrike_dot_net/van/van4.jpg

Cut patterns out of the white board like crescents , star and yes,
everything in Lucky Charms cereal. Smooth the edges and on the inside
(Inbetween the panel and white board use this clear stuff):
http://www.firestrike_dot_net/van/van3.jpg

I use it ontop of the white board on the walls to give a neat look to it.
(ie mounted amps and stuff on top, screwed into white board)

Then if I have enough of a space between the white board and panels
in the roof the neon lights should lite up the nite very nicely. The kids
will love sleeping in it too ;)  Nifty nite lite.

I'm trying to get ideas for putting the white board up on the roof or some
thing similar.

Apologies to those I may have rubbed the wrong way.  Hopefully this
illustrates what I want to do better.

James
