Hi.

I just picked up a '72 pop-top camper to save, and I would like it to be as 
complete as possible when I pass it on to the NEXT new owner.

I am looking for a '72 owners manual and a '72 Westy camper manual and a '72 
warrantee book.  Please communicate off list.

I have a '80 Vanagon Westy camper book, and a '77 bus owner's manual to 
trade, and a '77 Warrantee book

Thanks.

Barry Burneskis  Springfield VA '78 Westy daily driver, '72 Westy work in 
progress, and '74 Volvo with blown head gasket.
