Subject: HCBF, or how I spent my summer vacation (long)

I'm sitting in a Lowes parking lot at 3:30 pm on 150 degree pavement in 
Achin' A**hole NC with a carb float superglued to my finger wondering what 
the hell am I doing?  The answer is simple, coming back from a most 
excellent 9 days of camping.  Maybe I should explain a bit.

We left Charleston the 21st about 1:30 heading for West Virginia for a 
vacation.  The Burrito Express was purring along happy as could be, the new 
Solex 40mm carbs providing enough fuel to let the 1776 run cool and strong.  
Yeah - this is how life should be.  Wife and kids singin' along to some 
Muppets, I left the pager at home and the cool-phone's along for 'justin 
case'.

Made it to just north of Roanoke that first night, pulled into a KOA after 
hours, did the late night registration gig and popped the Dormobile top and 
went to bed.  Next morning did a quick check of the valves, #1 &amp; 4 intakes a 
touch tight.  Coffee to jump start the head, cereal to settle the stomach 
and off we purr again, ultimate destination - Hagarstown MD KOA for a few 
days of job and house hunting.  Set up camp, had a dinner that couldn't be 
beat and off to sleepytown for the night.

Next 3 days were a flurry of houses and a job interview for me, we found the 
'perfect house', 4 bedrooms, small orchard out back, munched a 
not-quite-ripe apple.  A barely adequate garage, only 45x17.  We put a 
deposit on it and went back to camp.

Next day, broke camp, did laundry, headed south to Front Royal and Skyline 
Drive.  Last time I was on Skyline was 3 years ago on my '76 BMW.  Speed 
limit 35, double that for grin factor on the bike.  In the Express, 35 is 
fine, speed's not the aim, we're enjoyin' the scenery.  Saw many deer, and 2 
momma bears with 2 cubs each.  Mommas were kinda skinny and the other folks 
on the road felt obligated to do dumb things like try and walk up to momma 
and babies for pix.  The rangers were having fits.  We camped at the last 
campground on Skyline that night.

About 3am, I woke up and went out to pee.  It was so foggy I could only see 
about 12 feet.  It was so cool!  Haven't been in fog like that since I lived 
in Crescent City CA.

Woke up again about 6, started the coffee and went for the morning 
constitutional (walk).  Followed a trail around the campground.  Came across 
a couple deer in a clearing, said good morning and we let each other go our 
separate ways.  Next clearing was 3 adult females and a fawn.  They were 
trying to get crabapples off a tree, there was another crabapple nearby.  I 
quietly skirted the deer, went to the other tree.  I pulled some apples off 
and tossed them over to the deer.  They ate the apples.  The fawn ate hers 
then ran away, around another tree and stopped about 15 feet behind and to 
my right.  I tossed her another, she ate it and ran around again, stopping 
about 12 feet away.  We repeated this a couple more times and the fawn 
stopped about 6 feet away form me.  I thought for  minute and decided that 
it wasn't really that good an idea to let her think humans were all as nice 
as I am so I hollered and they all scampered away.  Back to camp for coffee 
and breakfast and off we went, onward through the fog.

After the 4th car almost ran me off the road because they were taking my 
half of the road too, I decided to get off the parkway for a while (by now 
we are on the blue Ridge Parkway).  We sadly beat down to 81 and watched for 
the clouds to rise above the mountaintop.  Once they were high enough, we 
went back up to finish the parkway run to Boone.  We made it to Grandfather 
Mountain campground about 6:30 Wednesday night, saw Buddah going the other 
way in his (dare I say it??) Eurovan, set up the tarp for the rest of the 
Full Moon Bus Club and enjoyed having the whole field to ourselves.

Thursday Morning there was another tent with a red Bug next to it.  Turned 
out to be Jeff.  Thursday night Buddah and Royce arrived.  There were busses 
trickling in Friday day, more 'Moonies showed and we set up the big tarp in 
anticipation of rain (not that!) and the feeding of many hungry bus folks 
Saturday.  From that point on was a blur of busses, bus people, bus related 
events.  Was good to see all the friends old and new.  Saturday's 
burritofest was a success, though not everyone came to partake.  Their loss, 
since we try to cater to all tastes from carnivore to vegan.

It rained some Saturday afternoon but that was ok.  Before it did, some 
folks went hiking, some of us went swimming at the dam (Thanks for the ride 
Jen!).  Others went to play golf.  Saturday night we played VW Family feud.  
The notorious Blistered Dawson arrived to headline the festivities.  The 
judges officiated, and all had a real good time.  After the Full Moon Bus 
Club won the game and the audience got stumped, the door prizes and 
announcements happened then the traditional bonfire event.  Traditional 
S'mores for the kids, adults sipping adult beverages, and the traditional 
sacrifice of not ½, not a whole, but 1 ½ engine cases was observed to ward 
off bad juju for everyone's return trip.

Sumday woke a beautiful day.  Breakfast and coffee.  Treardown the tarps, 
pack the bus, sprint ahead of the carabus to get gas.

The Express ain't running right.  Hmmm.  Doesn't improve when I changed out 
the cap and rotor after observing much carbon and a trace of arcing in the 
cap.  Caught the carabus up the hill, running much worse, barely making the 
hills.  We pulled in, opened the engine room, smell of gas.  The left intake 
manifold is cold, the right sizzled my finger.  Called Mel over since he's 
been working on aircooled for years.  He suggested checking the valves, 
maybe they tightened up.
The fuel filter was kinda gunky so I changed that as long as I was in there. 
  (yeah, poor diagnostics doing 2 things and not checking the results of the 
first)  The carabus left without us, Snoopy and Joy who hung with us for 
moral support.  I checked the valves, they were fine.  Buttoned up the valve 
cover, doublechecked the wires, that all was fine.  The Express started 
right up with a throaty roar, oh cool.  We made it (barely) to the picnic 
area where the rest of the carabus was.  Kind folks donated cans of brake 
cleaner, electrical cleaner for an anticipated carb cleaning in the parking 
lot.  The carb came right off, popped the top, dumped the fuel.  Didn't 
notice the level in the bowl.  Sprayed cleaners through all the passages and 
jets, everything appeared clear.  When I went to reinstall the float, it 
felt kinda heavy, with liquid sloshing around.

Steve (I think) suggested poking a hole to get rid of the gas and glue it 
back up.  I happen to carry some epoxy, so that's what I did.  Ate lunch 
waiting for the epoxy to set, reassemble and install.  The Burrito Express 
rumbled to life, running like her old self again, happy to be alive as it 
were.  Down the parkway to 321, wave goodbye to the 2 nice ladies in the red 
splitty, Snoopy Joy and I compression brake our way down to Hickory.

In Hickory I hear a metallic tinkling sound.  Hmmmm.  I ask Joy on the CB if 
I'm dragging something, sure enough the right tailpipe tip of the EMPI dual 
(not so) quiet packs is falling off.  Simple fix, tear it off in the Winn 
Dixie parking lot (counted this as breakdown #3 since I had to stop).  Off 
we went with a load of Chips Ahoy and Cookie Monster cookies.

About an hour later comes the now-familiar loss of power, pull into the 
Lowe's parking lot.  Another carb pull, run into Lowes to pick up some 
superglue, the Epoxy didn't set right and the float filled again.  Patiently 
scrape off all the epoxy, superglue a tiny piece of knife blade over the 
gaping hole in the float and manage to superglue the whole deal to my 
finger.

Fortunately, this time I found the other hole in the float, under where the 
tab had been soldered to the float and so the Express roared to life one 
more time for the last run to Charleston.  Snoopy and Joy were there with us 
the whole time and I want to thank them again for their support.  We stopped 
1 more time for fuel and dinner, saw Royce drive by on 176.  A young lady at 
the gas station came over and tried to pick me up and kinda cut it short 
when she realized my wife was in the Express with me.  It was funny, and an 
ego builder (the old man's still got it, eh?).  The rest of the run was 
uneventful, running around a cool thunderstorm.

And that's how I spent my summer vacation.  Gotta figure out how to get paid 
to do this stuff.
