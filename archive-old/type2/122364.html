&gt; Here is a picture of wires going to my solenoid (76 2.0 FI Westy). When I turn
&gt; the key to crank all I get is a clicking sound. The yellow is a ground. With
&gt; the key turned, the red and blue are hot. The black one is dead. I think this
&gt; one is supposed to be hot with the key turned because when I touch a wire
&gt; between it and the terminal with the battery connection the bus fires.

&gt; Is it possible this little box can go bad? If so, what part do need to get?

What you are looking at is the hot start relay. It's not factory installed
but a good idea to have. Read about it:

http://type2_dot_com/bartnik/relay.htm

First check that the fuse isn't burned out. The relay could be bad. It's
Bosch 0 332 209 150 (pretty common automotive relay with many equivalents).

&gt; Also, if you look closely there is an empty place for another female spade
&gt; terminal on this little box. Up on the solenoid is a loose green wire. Is it
&gt; supposed to connect here?

The extra spade is part of the standard Bosch relay. It's 87a and it's
normally closed vs. 87 which is normally open. You get two relays in one in
a sense.
