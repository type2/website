Subject: nc bus campout march 10,11,12

Jennifer and Travis have been Jonesin' to do some bus camping and have to
get a fix in before EveryBus so................they have come up with The
Back Country BusFest!

The dates will be March 10,11 and 12. The location will be the woods
surrounding Travis rural homestead which is situted outside of Elerbie, NC
and within the beautiful Uwharee National Forest. Travis and Jen have
cleared some space, chopped up a tonne of fireword and built a nice firepit
for the bonfire. The will be no electric hookups but you can go potty in the
house if you need to :) Any and all vw buses are welcome!!!!!!! For more
details including the exact location ( I am working on a webpage for them)
can be obtained from the hosts mircobus1963_at_hotmail_dot_com This is a free event
brought to you by people that love buses and camping so please come out and
enjoy the beautiful rural surroundings. Oh yeah, bring you fishing gear and
Travis will take you catfishing! Beer and dogs are also welcome.
