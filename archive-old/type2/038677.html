Subject: bus starter maintenance

Hi Volks,
   It's been a lot of months since I promised, on the type2 list, to share 
with you the maintenance that I do to my starter on a yearly basis.  Since 
I've been doing this I haven't had any starter problems, hope it works for 
you too.

Starter Maintenance
	It wasn’t long after my wife and I started driving VW buses that I realized 
the starter is a problem area.  I, like so many others, was carrying a small 
hammer and short but thick jumper for when the starter would not turn over 
with a twist of the key.  Since banging and jumping the starter would revive 
it, I was convinced that there really wasn’t anything wrong with it that 
couldn’t be prevented.  Now I perform a yearly starter system maintenance 
routine that lets me prevent problems instead of just fixing them.  The 
benefit of this is that I get to deal with this on my terms; you know, 
during good weather, at a reasonable time of day, and in my own driveway
	Since there are different starters for different buses, I’ll just give you 
the basics of what I do and then let you apply it to your own situation.  
Consult the Bentley manual for specific tests, and information about the 
various starters and of course follow all precautions for working on the 
electrical system.  First is to disconnect and remove the battery.  As 
always, disconnect the negative lead first and then the positive.  Once the 
battery is out I check it for cleanliness, condition and proper water level. 
  I like to use a battery brush to clean the terminals on both the battery 
and battery leads.  Now is also a good time to check your battery tray for 
condition.  Next disconnect and remove the starter.  If necessary, first 
mark the wires so that you will get them back on the proper terminals.  
Clean the terminal ends of all the wires disconnected from the starter until 
they are shiny and clean.  Take the starter to a work bench or someplace 
else clean, where you can work on it.  Disconnect the heavy lead that 
connects the starter to the solenoid, and clean the end of it.  Next clean 
all of the terminals on the solenoid until they are shiny and clean.  I like 
to use a small brass wire brush for this.  Now remove the solenoid and check 
the plunger for condition and ease of movement.  You should be able to push 
it in and have it spring back out smoothly.  I wipe the plunger down with a 
little light weight oil like WD-40 or LPS 1.  With the plunger pushed all 
the way in, you should get continuity across the 2 large terminal studs on 
the solenoid.  Now it’s time to disassemble, clean, and inspect the starter. 
  Be observant as you take it apart, so you will be able to reassemble it.   
I do the following things to the starter; check the brushes for condition, 
remove and check the armature for condition, clean the commutator using a 
piece of scotchbrite.  Disassemble, clean, and inspect the drive mechanism 
parts, inspect the starter body and windings for condition.  Use compressed 
air or a vacuum cleaner to clean out the starter and windings.  Repair or 
replace anything you’ve found wrong and reassemble the whole thing.  I use a 
little high temperature white lithium grease on the drive mechanism parts at 
reassembly.
	Now all that’s left is to intall and hook up the starter and battery.  
Remember, hook up the battery’s positive lead and then the negative one.  
Hopefully, you’ll have the same luck as me, and not have to deal with the 
starter for another year.
