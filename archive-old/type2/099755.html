&gt;Can I go 70-75 easy.
&gt;&gt;Nope. 60-65 is a leisurely highway bus speed with that engine IMHO.

&gt;Ever with a 79 tranny? I thought they had taller gears for this very reason. 

They do have a slightly taller 4th gear, but that doesn't magically change the fact that you need more *horsepower* to go 70-75 regardless of gearing.

&gt;My friends 73 tranny was swapped to a 79 and it seemed to me 70 mph had the same engine sound as 60 previously. Am I incorrect?

Yes - the difference is not that great.  The overall ratio (4th plus final drive) in the '73 is (5.375*.82 =) 4.41.  The overall ratio in the 79 is (4.57*.89 =) 4.06.  If you were going 60mph with the '73 tranny, you would be going (60*4.41/4.06 =) 65mph with the '79 trans at the same RPM.  So your friend only gained 5mph, not 10mph.

Don't believe the butt-dyno or the ear-tach!  They lie.  :)
