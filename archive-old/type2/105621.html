Subject: RE: [T2] VW logo mud flaps

&gt; Does anyone know where I can get rear mud flaps just like this?
&gt; http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/.Pictures/Mudflaps.jpg



Yeah, nowhere unless the seller wants to be sued. :-(
These were available everywhere for years (West Coast Metric,
Motorworks, you name it) until it became known that whoever made them
didn't have a license to use the VW logo. Now, for fear of legal action,
nobody will sell them.  The closest I can get is a similar set that were
made by Volkswagen of Venezuela, which we do come across periodically.
While they are &quot;legit,&quot; frankly they're not as nice as on the &quot;bogus&quot;
ones were. They're nice and heavy, but the white logos look like they
were colored in by my 4 year old.  In fact, she would have done a better
job.  (Perhaps she could have applied for the position at the Volkswagen
factory there, if it still existed.:-)  Then again, they're all that's
available (short of perhaps a lucky find at a swap meet), so you take
what you can get...
