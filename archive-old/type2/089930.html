Subject: Re: bap engine running, timing question.

hi there....i also purchased a BAP Virtually new 
longblock, about 4-5months ago. 
and after makin a long 1500 mile adventure, she 
is still runnin great. no over heating even 
through the passes, no leaks, and no mysterious 
noises comin from her. all good news.
when i first started her up, i was also using a 
009, like u have now. started her by timing at 
7.5 degrees before top dead center. which ran 
cool. but i was finding, that i was getting a 
hesitation from the engine. due to the 
distributor not having an advance on it. 
but now that i have the correct distributor, 
thank u Jim, she runs smooth. 
so i would recommend to u, as i was adviced to 
do, to go to the oldvolkshome and search for 
your correct distributor for your year and make 
of volksie.

and then get on the list and ask around, or go 
to some junk yards and try to find the correct 
number. 
hope this helps. and keep us posted on how your 
BAP engine performs. *SHINE ON* -Chris(70westie)
