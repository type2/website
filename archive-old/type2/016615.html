&gt;Will a jump start on a FI bus
&gt;fry the alternator

  ... [or anything else]


Well, I guess I'll wade in now and tell y'all my own [potential] horror
story, which might reassure anyone who's really worried about this.

I have a '78 FI bus - owned it since new.  Back around 1988, I think it
was, we had a really frigid December here in New Jersey.  On this day, I
think it was about 8 degrees.  I'd gone to a mall about 17 miles from
home, and spent the usual hours moping around trying to find the perfect
gift(s).

When I returned to the full parking lot, the bus wouldn't even &quot;uh&quot; -
'twas deader than a doornail.  So I called my wife, who came down with
the big Chevy and jumper cables.  Well, the parking lot was so full, and
the bus was backed into its space, so the cables wouldn't reach to the
back of the bus.  While we were waiting for an adjacent space to be
vacated by a departing shopper, the driver of the brand spanking new
Jeep Cherokee that was parked behind me arrived on the scene. 
Surprisingly, without hesitation, he offered to give me a jump start.

Following what I felt was accepted protocol, I connected the cables to
my battery, and gave him the &quot;donor&quot; end to connect to his vehicle.

I forget the gory details, perhaps blotted from my mind like other bad
memories.  The bus didn't crank, and there was alot of smoke and sparks
at his end.  Needless to say, he'd crossed 'em up.

The truly amazing (and reassuring) conclusion was that, after correcting
the polarity on his end, the bus started (after much cranking - the oil
was thick as cold molasses), he departed, unperturbed, and I drove home.

I suffered no damage whatsoever.

I suppose the lesson here (there's always a lesson in a horror story,
no?) is the difference between theoretical and empirical knowledge.  I'm
sure that, if asked whether reversing the cables would do any damage, a
good engineer/mechanic would respond with an emphatic &quot;I wouldn't
recommend it&quot;.

Neither would I.  But I have done it, and the bus and I survived the
experience unscathed.
