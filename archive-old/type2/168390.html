Subject: Octobus???

Hmmm...I don't believe I am actually considering this.  It has been ten 
years since I did much in a VW other than commute my butt off trying to 
keep all the balls in the air.  Yes, life touring the country in the 
Mothership is a fine thing but eventually one must settle.  When I 
returned from my travels, the &quot;Search for the Beginning of Wind&quot;, I 
started my next adventure, becoming owner of a river outfitting 
company.  You can take a look at 3roar_dot_com if you like but that is not 
what this note is about.

I am toying with doing a camp out this fall.  Probably in October.  I 
am thinking of where to do it right now and exploring some 
possibilities.  Will inform soon as I know the interest levels.

Three things I can assure you of;  1. We will have canoes and kayaks 
available for the attendees.  2. We will be near the Ocmulgee, Oconee, 
and Altamaha Rivers in Southern Georgia (Probably right beside one of 
them).  3.  The camp out will be to raise money for a charity.  My 
choice would be too raise money for Multiple Sclerosis.  We will 
channel those funds through the National MS Society (Atlanta Chapter).

Don't know what to call it yet but time will title it if it happens.

Now my question to all that read and pontificate here is:
Would you be interested in coming down to south Georgia in October for 
such a hang out event?

The response will contribute to the final direction and how much effort 
I expend toward it.

Thanks for tolerating the ramblings,

Charlie Ford
