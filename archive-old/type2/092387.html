Subject: Re: [T2]  bus  buying question 

Moonbreeze
Depends...on where you live as to the access you will have to 32 yr old used 
bus parts (and other important recources), and what shape what you have is 
in...but generally, you are better off buying a bus that is mostly their.  I 
collected parts for my 76 for 2 1/2 years before starting on the project.  It 
took me 7 months to put it all together...I also studied and gathered 
information from the web on every system I was to work on to make the best 
possible decisions in regards to cost, resources , and most 
importantly...time.  Rebuilding a bus is a way of life, not just a hobby. 
And, oh yah...exceptionally rewarding, cause YOU built it, and you can keep 
it going indefinately...ah yes, the VWINTERFACE.  (It also helps to have your 
significant other to understand this proccess...and maybe even be supportive)
Aloha, and Good Luck,
Jeff Raven
