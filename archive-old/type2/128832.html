Subject: Re: [T2] I'm getting the busloops

&lt;&lt;  You know you have the 
busloops when you come to believe that you can drive your bus to the 
fields of ambrosia* and, once there, meet every creature desire and 
spiritual need you have ever managed to desire and need. Not to mention 
some desires and needs that you never knew you desired or needed, ones 
that only come with bus ownership.&gt;&gt;

Yeah like imagining having a warmer instead of a heater is okay despite the rain and 34 degree weather... &lt;grin!&gt;
