Subject: Re: [T2] 1968 Bus Passengerside Windshield Wiper Arm

&gt; I have few set of arms. How does one tell if it's a 1968 arm?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Does anybody out there have a spare 68 type
&gt; &gt;wiper arm or know where one may be obtained?

The 68s are smooth, not splined. maybe 1/4&quot; dia approx. held on by a
clamping arrangement of which Ive seen a couple different schemes.
&gt;
