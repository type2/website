&gt; Maybe it's just me, but I get sorta sick of ACVW drivers complaining that

&gt; (Not that there's anything wrong with that).  ;)

Why? I know of several old beetle owners that bought new beetles. And
it's not just us ACVW owners that would buy into it. Many of the
people that get excited when they see us in our old busses would buy a
modern version.
