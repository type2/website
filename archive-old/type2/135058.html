Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof troubleshooting.

&gt; What is the best way to get the system open and figure out what is broken?
&gt; jack

With moderate pressure from the crank handle (don't brake it, just keep it 
moving with the roof) Use a slide hammer with a wide flat hook inserted into 
the forward seam from on top of the roof to pull it back slowly. Just enough 
to get a large wood block in there to tap on. Be careful not to damage it as 
much as possible. This will help preserve the cables and the lifts. Do all 
this and keep the Bentley instructions by your side and follow them.

You might damage the roof a little but this can be fixed or replaced easier 
than the cables.
