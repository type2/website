Subject: [T2] Successfully pulled engine &amp; trans last night--THANKS

Is this list great or what.  I had over a dozen people try to answer 
my questions.  People I love ya!

It came out without a hitch.  The most time consuming part was the CV 
joints.  Why are the bolts 12 spline on the tranny and allen on the 
wheel side.  Took me a half an hour of banging on it, craning my neck 
where it didn't want to go, to figure this out.  Other than that, it 
was easy.

I sure wish people who sell me their autos would spend a little money 
at the car wash on cleaning the engine, etc on a regular basis.  It 
took me two hours to clean my garage afterwards.  I don't mean to 
sound like a clean freak, but I'm allergic to grease.  I like to work 
on these engines not wallow in the grime. You can eat of my engines.

Now I have to find a new tranny.  Does Rancho Performance sell 
direct?  (I need a trip to a warm place and would like to see if this 
core is  worth anything before I spend money on shipping.) What other 
vendors do you recommend?

May the VW gods smile on you as usual,
