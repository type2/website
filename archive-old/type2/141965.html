&gt; I changed the oil cooler, and
&gt; torqued it to 60inlbs, and used new seals.  Up by the distributor, oil
&gt; pressure switch looks dry.  Are the oil filter flanges known to leak where
&gt; they meet the case? Also it looks like I will have to take the cooler off
&gt; again to getto the top nut on the flange, to check it sealing capabilities.

Hello Eric    While you were in there doing the oil cooler seals did you do 
the fan seal and o ring?? You should have while you were there  .  You still 
can just by removing the fan and hub .   Also check or replace the oil filter   
Does your motor have the thermosta hooked up and is the wheel in place for the 
cable.  I have seen these left off and the case will leak from the pulley 
bolt not being there   later and have fun  Mark Dearing
