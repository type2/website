Subject: Rust in window corners?

 Can anything be done about the actual window frame when it is totally rust
penetrated?  On one of my sliders the rubber rotted, then water got in the
cracks.  Scoured my catalogs for replacement metal...nada.  Might have to
replace the whole door? Does anyone know if DC rear windows are the same as
bus? Or where to get DC rockers. I know all I do is ask questions, someday I
hope to have a few answers. Thanks again, Nik
