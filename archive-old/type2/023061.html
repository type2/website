A lot of questions?  You're not kidding!  :-)

&gt;a. The makings for a longblock came in boxes, but it's shot.  I'm thinking 
&gt;I'll buy a rebuilt longblock, perhaps a 2 liter.  Any advice on 
&gt;sources?  (I have a few picked out.)  How do 17/18/2000 blocks, lifters 
&gt;(hydraulic vs. mech), clutch/flywheels, etc. vary? IOW, what do I need to 
&gt;pay attention to in order to make sure it fits my setup?

Lots to know here.  The 1.7 having a 210mm flywheel and clutch and the 1.8 
having either the 210 (early) or 215mm flywheel and clutch.  The 210 and 
215mm setups are completely interchangeable.  The 2.0 clutch/flywheel is 
228mm and will not quite fit into the 75's bellhousing but you can use the 
1.8 flywheel and clutch on the 2.0 engine.  Can't remember if the starter 
is the same or not.


&gt;b. I'm thinking I'll get a single weber progressive carb (see 1d).

Yeccchhhh.  Keep the FI if you can.

&gt;Can I use a FI block (2liter) with an electric pump (one of those low 
&gt;pressure ones to replace a mechanical pump)

Yes.

&gt;or do I need a block that is set up for a mechanical pump?  Does this 
&gt;single carb work ok with the brake servo and a stock (vacuum advance) 
&gt;distributor?

It will work okay if the manifold has the port (you can add it if it doesn't).


&gt;c.I need to find a *complete* set of cooling tins (incl. fan shroud) as 
&gt;well as a complete exhaust system.  what's the best way to make sure I 
&gt;have everything, and the right parts for my application?  (I don't need 
&gt;new, just operational)

Best way is to find a donor bus.  Most parts can be bought from Bus Depot 
and/or BustedVW both of whom are on this list.

&gt;d.I'm getting a nervous tic from just looking at all the wires dangling in 
&gt;my engine compartment.  Am I better off (whatever that means) isolating 
&gt;auxiliary stuff (lights, instruments, etc) and starting from scratch with 
&gt;engine electrics (tearing out all that factory-diagnosis and FI stuff) or 
&gt;trying to repair what I have?  Does that question even make sense?

It won't seem so daunting once you study it for a while.  Get the Bentley 
manual.  You can remove the diagnostic stuff if you want, you'll probably 
never use it.

&gt;a. I'd like to run a fridge, both when I'm driving and when I'm stopped.
&gt;Should I get a regular dorm fridge and a 12v DC to 120v AC adaptor,

That won't work well.  Most fridge compressors won't work off of the square 
or modified square wave produced by low-cost inverters.

&gt;or should I get one of those 12v DC fridges (you can get them at truck 
&gt;stops) and a 120v AC to 12v DC adaptor for when I'm stopped?

Much better.  Just remember that the peltier-device type (identifiable by 
their very low price and light weight) will only cool to 40 degrees below 
ambient air temp, and will take &quot;forever&quot; to cool stuff down.

&gt;Or should I find a later Westy fridge and retro-fit?

Probably your best option.

&gt;I would like to run just one battery with a high-amp alternator (see 1d).

I strongly recommend that you run at least two batteries.  Otherwise 
starting your bus after a night of camping will always be a guessing 
game.  You can't get a very high-amp alternator for the bus 
unfortunately.  Biggest available is about 70 amp and most are 55 amp.

&gt;Thank you for reading this far!  Some friends and I are trying to get 
&gt;ready for a LONG road trip next summer (hence the bug wasn't enough).  If 
&gt;you make some friends and help us get on our way, we just might happen to 
&gt;be in your area with frosty beverages and willing VW hands if you need 
&gt;either next summer....

Look me up, I'm in the book in Dallas, Tx. and on the AIRS list.
