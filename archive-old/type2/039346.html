Subject: Re: EFI sputtering

I had the exact same problem and it wound up to be the fuel 
pressure regulator.  The pressure would hold for a while then as I 
am going down the road it would sputter.  shut it off for a while and 
all was fine till about 10 miles later.  replaced several components 
and finally after replacing the regulator it worked fine.  Even a fuel 
pressure test did not diagnose this one.
