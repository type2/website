Hello Guys  This isnt really true  Sabarus have their own head problems even 
make a coolant treatment to stop it. which is what happens when you take one 
back under warrenty at the dealers for head gaskets. I have probably done twice 
as many head gaskets on Sabus than on vanagons. The biggest thing is not too 
ever overheat them both. Also the coolant treatment works very well in 
vanagons. part # soa635071  dont know what it is made in england by a company call 
holts  This is true snake oil that works  Dr Tim will be rolling his eyes   
later and have fun  Mark Dearing   Salem Import Service  Salem Va
