Subject: EGR....optional??

I talked to a guy who has worked on bugs and transporters for a while and he 
told me i could disconnect the whole Exhaust Gas Recirculation system, 
starting at the throttle without any negative consequences...he said it doesn't work 
that well anyway.  Has anyone ever done this, or am I the only knucklehead to 
do it?  What could the possible repurcussions be?
