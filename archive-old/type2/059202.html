You might find 1/8&quot; luan paneling works better than 1/4&quot;, as its closer to the original thickness. I've used it to replace the wood panels in the back of my Westy ( Most don't realise they are'nt original until they look closely), just find a stain that matches the original, and use the old ones, if possible, as templates. I've also used it to replace the front door panels, peeling the vinyl off the old warped panels, using them as templates to cut new ones out of the 1/8&quot; stuff, and glueing the vinyl to the new ones. 1/4&quot; is too thick, as the door hardware won't fit like it should.
