Subject: Re: [T2] When Bus Owners Strike Back (window Installation)

Jules,
I lack the words and memory to explain better than Bentley, but here
are a few random pointers.

You do not need to remove the lifter mechanism to insert the new glass.
The vent wing does _not_ need to be removed. The front channel may
need to be pushed but that is it. The new window slides in through the
bottom inside the door frame. It is a tight fit, but it goes even
though I thought I was going to break the glass. You have to remove
all the screws you can on the channels and lifter mechanism. A little
bending of the channels may be required. If i remember right it may
help to remove the door latch. You have to play with the height of the
lifter mechanism to get the glass in.

When I had to change the glass after the bum in SF I was by Santa
Cruz. I was under a lot of pressure because the girl was very afraid
to sleep in the bus without the glass and kept asking if I would be
able to do the job and WHEN it would be done. So Jules, consider
yourself happy :))

- Arnaud
