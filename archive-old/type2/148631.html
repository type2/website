&gt;OK. First thing that's got me confused is this, &quot;Timing Set At:: 5deg
&gt;ATDC w/ vacuum hose(s) connected&quot;. Almost everything I've read says to
&gt;time the single vacuum advance distributor at 7.5deg BTDC.  I thought
&gt;the distributors that were set at 5deg ATDC were usually the dual
&gt;vacuum models.

Correct.

&gt;Should I throw out my assumption that this distributor indeed matched
&gt;the specs of the 113905205AN and follow my gut instinct to set this at
&gt;7.5deg BTDC at idle?

Where the bruck part number came from, who knows. If there is no retard function on the vacuum can the engine should be timed BTDC.

&gt;OK. So lets say I set everything at 7.5deg BTDC at idle. Then I should
&gt;get 7.5 + (22 to 25) = 29.5 - 32.5 deg BTDC at 3500 RPM? correct? And
&gt;my timing at WOT with the vacuum hose connected or disconnected should
&gt;be about the same because I should have little vacuum on that vacuum
&gt;port at WOT?

Yes.

&gt;Also my timing at idle should be roughly the same with or
&gt;without vacuum at idle for the same reason - no vacuum?

Yes.

&gt;Also, one more thing, is 7.5 BTDC at idle roughly the same as setting
&gt;my timing statically to 7.5deg BTDC? Just curious.

Depends on your skill. I rely on the timing light.

&gt;Why did I buy the Bruck Dizzy? It's making me dizzy. I think I should
&gt;have stuck with the genuine Bosch, then I could at least be more sure
&gt;the distributor specs matched the actual part. The not knowing is not
&gt;really worth it for the $20 I saved.

Use a helper and graph the advance curve. Unscrew the dashpot on the carb linkage to keep the idle steady while you read the advance with a timing light and tach.
