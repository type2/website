MY TURN MY TURN!

In my garage is my business office; a 9'x12' all boys clubhouse with a small
beer fridge, TV, stereo, computer, a small parts/projects work table,
telescopes, a turntable and my 700+ LPs. Then, outside of my office is my
'63 Sundial with completed first stage body work and base color, The tires
are on cradles which allow me to push the bus around to make more room to
work on a particular area. The engine is on a workbench, surrounded by my
MiG welder, air tools and a 5 HP compressor and a roll around Craftsman tool
chest.

But this is all in my garage because it has been over 100 degrees for 56
days of this summer and the garage is air conditioned. Otherwise the bus and
the tools are out in the 12'x24' shop and covered parking/work area with the
drill press, bench grinders, torch welder, anvil, big ass vise, bus doors,
windows and all the camper interior.

When it got too hot to work outside or in the shop, the bus I moved into the
garage and the wife's 1999 Infiniti lives in the driveway. Hey, I built her
a carport!

Subject: [VB] What's in your garage?


&gt; It's finally friday and I'd like to pursue the topic I proposed a couple
of
&gt; days ago.
&gt; Namely &quot;What's in your garage?&quot; Based on my own experience, I realized
long
&gt; ago that my garage will probably never hold my &quot;daily driver&quot;. In my
garage
&gt; now resides the following:
&gt; A 1961 ragtop beetle &quot;off the pan&quot; on the right side, with the beetle pan
on
&gt; the left side.
&gt; Piled on top of that, two aftermarket floor pans, two complete sets of
&gt; engine tin for a 1500, three 6V starters, and various other engine parts.
&gt; Between the beetle and it's pan sit an air compressor, oxy-acatelyne
welding
&gt; set up and a mig welder.
&gt; To round out the clutter, there's various lawn chairs, a dog cage, gas
cans
&gt; and at least three trash bags full of crushed beer cans waiting to be
cashed
&gt; in.
&gt; In the driveway, sits my '66 Westy along with a '64 beetle convertible
&gt; (non-runner) and an '81 rabbit convertible (son's daily driver).
&gt; My wife's has long ago given up the idea of parking anywhere but on the
&gt; street.
&gt; John
