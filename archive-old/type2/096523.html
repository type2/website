Subject: Re: [T2] The blues continues! ARGH!

RJ,

I didn't see plugs listed as replaced?
Did it run this way to start with?

Time to go back to basics.

Spark plug test...remove one by one and note any change in idle.
Do the same thing, but drive it a block or two and see if
that plug/cylinder is contributing anything to power.
Spark looks good? or not.


Engine off....pull the aircleaner and watch and see if your 
accelerator pump on the carb is working...after warm up/or choke open, see 
if you get a stream of gas shooting down into the carb when you rotate
the accelerator linkage.

30-35 max is bad....something is seriously off...you already knew this 
though.

Got a dwell meter and/or compression gauge?

Is the coil connected properly...if backwards, then weak spark.
Exhaust restriction of some kind?  How does the exhaust feel?..plenty of 
exhaust coming out?

If you move the advance on the dist around does it get better? or 
worse...not too much...just a little to see what happens.

Does the vacuum advance on the dist really work?  Suck on it and watch.

Vacuum for the dist really exsist at the carb?  or blocked?

Cheers ,dave

&gt; Alright everyone - Please, I am on my hands and knees-
&gt; 
&gt; 	I emailed the list awhile back with an problem I was having with my new
&gt; mexican motor (&quot;Got the 'cant get the new engine to work right' Blues&quot;
&gt; thread)
&gt; 
&gt; 	I followed the advice of the listees to narrow down and hopefully eliminate
&gt; any variables in the equation but to no avail.  Heren is where I am at:
&gt; 
&gt; 	New points, wires, condenser, rotor, cap, mexican engine, fuel pump,
&gt; filter, oil, and 34 pict 3 carb.  Freshly adjusted valves and points, rotor
&gt; pointing at the right place where cylinder 1 is at TDC, and lined up with my
&gt; clean and smooth 205P vacumn advance dizzy.  Timing set to 7.5 BTDC as per
&gt; the dizzy specs.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Engine starts and runs -once the chooke cuts out, idles low but steady.
&gt; Tach/Dwell says is idling at 550.  Carb adjustments are per library
&gt; instructions- 1 turn out for the big one, 2.5 turns out for small one. Main
&gt; throttle cam has that 1/4 turn from touching lobe.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Turning the carb adjustments past this has no effect, except in the extreme
&gt; cases(all the way in) the engine starts to stall.  I've sprayed half a can
&gt; of ether around all connections hoping to find a leak, and nothing.  Driving
&gt; is okay but it has no power - maxes out at 30-35 MPH and isnt very quick
&gt; about getting there.  Seems to be a bit hot, but its been 3 years since my
&gt; last aircooled so I can't really be to sure of myself.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Wits end.  Absolute wits end.  Is it mechanic time ?  Have I exhausted my
&gt; options? :(
&gt; 
&gt; Hopefully-
&gt; -rj
