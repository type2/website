Subject: Re: Y2K.....bus?

Here Here! I have two view points on this matter...
 My daily driver is a 99 Jetta. I notice that those who drive H2O cooled 
either simply ignore one another, or in many cases have a &quot;Mine's 
Better/Faster&quot; attitude. Not exactly like driving my old VW's. 
Other thing is, when I do wave at old buses and the like in my Jetta, I get 
this &quot;Hey, who are you waving at?&quot;  kinda look, that goes with the &quot;you are 
driving a 'new' VW, so what do you know?&quot; attitude. 
Basically, I don't get the warm and fuzzy's driving my Jetta...from either 
side of the VW community. But, on the other hand, while driving my old VW's, 
the world looks pretty rosey!
Just my two cents!
