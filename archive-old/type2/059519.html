Subject: Re: [RE Heating a VW bus

The heat in a VW thread, with associated warnings, goes around again!

I am convinced that the Carver Propex heater is the ideal solution to the 
problem of heat in the bus. But these things are pricey.

In the archives, I noticed that someone had planned to install a Force 10 
boat cabin heater in a bus. These are $299 (about 1/2 the price of a 
Carver). They burn propane, and have a safety cutoff that kicks in if 
oxygen level &quot;drops too low.&quot; (I wonder how low is too low.) West Marine 
claims that the furnace is &quot;Built for use on the move,&quot; and is 
&quot;unaffected by motion.&quot;

The downside is that you have to cut a 1&quot; diameter hole in the roof for 
the flue. I can see it attached to a sheet of plywood bolted to the 
backside of the bulkhead on the passenger side. They're kinda perty -- 
brass and stainless steel. 16-1/2&quot;X7-3/4&quot;X7&quot;.

Seems like the way to go, to me. Anyone?
