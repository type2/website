&gt;&quot;What is different about people back then as compared to today's folks? 

 
Paul,

I wouldn't call myself an old dude, but I will offer my opinion. I believe
the attitude we see in other drivers (and sometimes ourselves) is pretty
normal. The difference is control. Being stuck behind a Bus is no more
aggravating today than in the past, but in the past we were more civilized.
As a society we are becoming increasingly less civil and increasingly more
lawless. In the past, there was a sense of community, and people were
raised to treat one another with respect. The relativism of the 60's
spawned the me-ism of the 80's and have given us a culture bent on complete
personal autonomy. (I'm in charge of my destiny, I decide what's right and
wrong, so ultimately I'm the only one that matters.) You're question is
perceptive, as the problem isn't cars, or speed limits, or traffic, or
population, or the economy, or education, or whatever; it's attitude. If I
believe that I always come first, its always going to piss me off that you
are in the way. If I don't respect you as a human being, then I'm going to
let you know about it.

When folks honk at me, I just smile and wave (most of the time).
