Tried my best. According to the identification info in the library, my bus
was produced on approximately the 4th day of the 21st week, but of what
year? From what date do I begin to count the weeks? My guess is August '71.
According to the vin#, the model year is clearly 1972. I need the info to
buy brake shoes.

Thanks
