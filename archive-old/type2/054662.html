Subject: Re: Did I make it to 250lb ft?

Hi Derek!

&gt;  I had a Craftsman 1/2&quot; drive,  20&quot; long breaker bar with a cheater bar 
&gt; attached to that. &lt;at 3 1/2 foot&gt;
&lt;snipped&gt;
&gt;  pushing up with all I could muster.(legs and arms).  

Hmmm, the thing is how much can you bench press?  Really.  If you were 
putting the same lift force it would take to (calculating, one second...) 
lift 72 pounds (and that's figuring if the cheater was all the way against 
the head of the breaker bar) you hit 250#.  

Now, I've had Taiwanic tools break like that, but Craftsman, even the new 
ones, are usually better than that... however, I *did* break one of theirs on 
a rear axle nut once (taking it off) and went back to sears... told him what 
I was doing and what happened, he chuckled and fixed me up with a 3/4&quot; drive 
breaker and the socket to fit.  It was expensive, but it worked, no prob., 
even with a 6' cheater pipe and a 150# woman jumping on it...(and it came 
right off!)  That's now my &quot;standard&quot; breaker bar, and I got the adapter to 
go from 3/4 to 1/2.

&gt; Sears was no help in giving me a twisting torque break point value.  Any 
&gt; guesses??

A lot! &lt;grin&gt;

Now at work... we have 1 1/2&quot; drive sockets... to work on the bridge!  Seen 4 
guys hanging off the end of the cheater handle tightening *those* bolts... 
but they were a bit bigger (the bolts *and* the guys!)!
