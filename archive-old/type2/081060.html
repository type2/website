for sale 78 bus, slider top in rear, was running but valve is messed up =
in one head so I took the engine out and that is as far as it got. bus =
in pretty good shape, Fuel Injected.  Also  a 76 Riviera camper goes =
with it, motor locked up in it and body is trash, a 1800 engine goes =
with it as well and is disassembled. All for $700. Located in High Point =
N.C. call Scott _at_ 336-869-3811 and leave message, its hard to catch me =
at home.
