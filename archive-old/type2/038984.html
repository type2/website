&gt;The other rear valve would not come loose, even spray liquid wrench
&gt;on it.


I was stuck with two of my bleeder nipples until I applied moderate to high
moderate heat, then touched a candle to the base of the nipple.  The
wax/parafin got sucked into the &quot;socket&quot; (like solder does when you sweat a
copper pipe joint), and Voila!  out it came.

Probably doesn't ALWAYS work, buy it did for me, even after much heat,
Liquid Wrench, etc.

Good luck.
