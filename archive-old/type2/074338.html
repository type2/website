&gt; I'm new to the list and have been doing some research. Just bought a 73 bus...and everything I read seems to be about repairing them. One story recounted - as almost miraculous -  driving 2,000 miles without a major problem. What's the scoop? Am I going to have to get into the Tao of VW repair or go nuts in denial (turn the radio up when I hear a noise, take it to car wash when it seems to be over heating, etc.?)    Trudell

welcome to the world of bus ownership.

these are very reliable vehicles but
yours is just short of 30 years old. who knows what the maintanence was
before you got it.  and one of the things on this list is help getting
parts and information that is no longer avaliable at your local VW
dealership.

   your bus can take you many trouble free miles but it does need it's
share of being taken care of.  did you buy it as a cheap set of wheels,
well it can be that, or are you going to restore it to like new condition,
that is another option.  but I think the majority of folks on this list
drive thier buses but also want them to last a while and tend to be slowly
bringing em back from the junkyard crusher.   I have a 78 and I have had
it for almost 9 years now, and I drive it well over 10,000miles a year. in
those 100,000 plus miles it has only needed to be towed home 3 times.  Now
I owned a Mercedes Benz before this and I towed it home more often.  And
the things that happened are the kind of things that could happen to
anyone anywhere.   get triple A if you are really nervous, but learn your
vehicle, drive it, enjoy it, take resonable care of it, and it will give
you great karma and many many enjoyable miles
(hope I didn't jinks my bus talking about it not leaving me)
