Subject: '78 Westy Headliner
Message-Id: &lt;19990517125330.BPWX22844_at_webmail.worldnet.att_dot_net&gt;

Could someone tell me what the headliner panel over the 
front seats is supposed to look like on my '78 Westy?  A 
PO has glued canvas over the panel and it doesn't look 
too cool.  Is this a wood grain panel to match the Westy 
interior or something else?

Thanks,
Brad
