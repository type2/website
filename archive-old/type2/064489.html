Subject: gas tank panel removal _at_#$%??

Hi all
 
I finally got around to trying to remove the panel that separates the engine compartment 
from the fuel tank compartment (thanks for the tips, Rodney). The gasoline smell mystery 
had to be solved and fixed. I removed the BN4 which needed servicing anyway, all the air 
cleaner stuff, the left hand side carburetor, and managed to get the panel to move 
freely but not drop down or come out.
 
Does this panel on the 74's have a lip at the top that hooks into the top part of the 
engine compartment, I could not see any clips in this top area but a white body piece 
runs the full length of the top just behind the access lid opening and as best I can see 
and guess is that a lip on the grey coloured panel hooks into this preventing the panel 
from dropping down. The panel would have to be tilted forward from the bottom so the lip 
could then drop down and out. But a back portion of the grey panel which I cannot see 
because of the channel at the bottom of the panel catchs on the engine tin. If anybody 
can understand what I am taking about, advise would be appreciated.

Meanwhile I noticed that the feul pump was dripping gasoline, seems to be coming from 
the cover area. Can a repair kit be installed without removing the pump from the engine? 
Is there anything to beware of when repairing or removing or reinstalling the feul pump?
