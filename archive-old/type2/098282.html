Subject: Re: [T2] Accessory Vespa for Bus

Actually, my personal interest in the new Vespa's was 
primarily as a reliable, economical downtown vehicle for 
my girlfriend to use to get back and forth to school.  
It also has a smaller footprint than her car.  I travel 
a lot in my line of work, so I with the roadside 
assistance she would have a free ride to the shop, and 
warranty work to fix it if I should be out of town.  
Plus, it's a good alternate set of wheels to haul around 
with the camper.

Also, I am concerned not at all with looking like 
a &quot;stupid trend hopper.&quot;  I'll save that for the folks 
snapping up vintage Vespas to look Retro Cool. 

Regards,
