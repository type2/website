Subject: key code is where on cylinder?

Howdy all,

Where on the lock cylinder is the key code stamped???

I have just removed both front door lock cylinders and can't find a code
stamped anywhere.  I am afraid there isn't one there.  I also removed the
sliding door lock, but that seems to be in a caseing, and I figure I'll
tackle that tomorrow.

I bought a bus for $75 tonight.  I'll relate the story someother time, but
right now I'd really like to get a key made so I can unlock the steering
column (without removing the ignition switch, please:).

Any help would be appretiated.

thanks,
        brandy
