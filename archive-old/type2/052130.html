Subject: [T2] Fuel injection hesitation (little long)

Dear all,
I replaced a dead engine with one I found through the type2 list. The '78
2.0 FI engine has high compression and was rebuilt (not too distant past)by
a very reputable firm. I &quot;earballed&quot; the distributor to get by for a day or
two until I could time it correctly. Ran fine (slight hesitation). Put about
30 miles on it. Changed the oil, oil filter, oil filter screen, spark plugs,
spark plug wires and fuel lines. Put 10 miles on it. Drove to work next
morning (4 miles) with it running a little funny. Timed it in parking lot at
work with my light bulb w/ jumper wires. Didn't run at all. &quot;Earballed&quot; it
again to attempt to get home. Got about 2 miles and she would die everytime
I accelerated. She surges for about 1 - 2 seconds and dies. I abandoned her
till traffic died down. Went back in evening and limped home. Give her gas -
she surges and then dies. I had to restart her no less than 100 times to
make it home.
I have tried replacing the AFM (from a friends bus of the same type),
adjusted the points with a dwell meter, checked the fuel pressure, timed her
with a gun, replaced the fuel pump with a spare (but not the fuel filter,
which was replaced 4 months ago), replaced the cold start temp sensor with a
spare, replaced the dampner with a spare, replaced the auxiliary air
regulator with a spare. So far nothing has changed the condition. Any ideas?
Thanks much in advance,
Howie Anderson
'77 Westy
