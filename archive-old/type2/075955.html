Subject: Re: [T2] solid/hydraulic swap?

Yeah....Change those components and mis match hardnesses and find yourself
walking!

Cams and lifters must start and end life toghether, they are an inseperable
set, unless machined and then the process starts all over again.

FYI the Hydro and solid cams have 2 different profiles.

Keep it solid, adjust the valves and drive it.

&gt; [...]
&gt;
&gt; What a bunch of hooey.... sounds like a campaign speech from a politician!
&gt;
&gt; All you need are 8 hydraulic lifters, 8 steel pushrods, 8 flat washers, 8
wave
&gt; washers, and 4 spacers.
&gt;
&gt; You don't need a hydraulic cam. All these parts work on a solid cam.
&gt; They have worked fine so far on my 77 Westy and it has over 76000 miles on
it.
&gt; Hard miles, I cruise on the freeway at 80-85 all day.
&gt; And they have worked fine so far on my daughters 77 Westy, for almost
100,000
&gt; miles.
&gt; [and I used the best USED lifters I could find from wrecking yard
engines!!]
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; on 11/23/01 2:53 PM, you related:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; gang,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; what i'm wondering is, would it be
&gt; &gt; &gt; possible for me to rebuild the 76 engine, and just
&gt; &gt; &gt; swap the solid lifters for hydraulics. can this be
&gt; &gt; &gt; done?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; this is possible. there are things which need to be done. i may not get
all
&gt; &gt; of them, but here goes:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; any stock vw hydraulic cams and lifters (from a core motor) will most
likely
&gt; &gt; not be useable, so you will need a new cam. don't regrind, get a new one
and
&gt; &gt; good new lifters. excellent cams are found here:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; http://www.webcaminc_dot_com/
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; the case needs to be modified, but not drastically. the oil passages are
&gt; &gt; different. i can't be specific, but if you put up a post about what you
want
&gt; &gt; to do on the type4um here...

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ...you will undoubtedly get a chorus of educated replies to your
questions.
&gt; &gt; some may tell you not to switch: this solid/hydraulic debate is a hot
one in
&gt; &gt; certain circles. i myself have just converted my 1979 bus motor to solid
&gt; &gt; lifters and a performance cam. there are benefits on either side of the
&gt; &gt; debate.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; the pushrods are different, as is some valvetrain hardware. the rocker
&gt; &gt; shafts on hydraulic motors have solid spacers and springy washers
instead of
&gt; &gt; the flat washers and springs found on the solid heads. listmember terry
kay
&gt; &gt; was doing this swap, then changed his mind, so he may have a bunch of
these
&gt; &gt; bits.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; one HAS to ask why you feel the need to do this swap: is it because of
&gt; &gt; frequent valve adjustments? if so, this may be indicative of cam wear,
or
&gt; &gt; even seat recession. once a cam begins to wear, it deteriorates rapidly.
&gt; &gt; hydraulic lifters on a bus motor are not a panacea. many knowledgeable
&gt; &gt; engine builders swear completely off them. others use them. the point
is,
&gt; &gt; that while switching to hydraulic lifters may seem to be a
problem-solver,
&gt; &gt; it is not that simple. there are different problems inherent in
hydraulic
&gt; &gt; lifter motors that your solid motor does not have. if your motor is in
need
&gt; &gt; of a rebuild anyways, you may be better off rebuilding a hydraulic motor
&gt; &gt; than assembling all the bits to turn yours into one. if your motor is in
&gt; &gt; good shape, then it might be cheaper to modify it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; hope that helps.
