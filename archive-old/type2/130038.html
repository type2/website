Subject: Second alternator

I finally purchased a second alternator for my bus.  It's going to go above 
the fan housing,  driven by the same belt that is currently driving my A/C 
compressor.  Went to a Pick-N-Pull this morning with a friend and lo and 
behold, they were having a 50% sale.  50% off of every single part!  That 
means a complete motor with all accessories for $75 (+core, +tax of 
course), and alternators for $8.  I walked through the European car section 
first - most of the VWs used Motorola alternators, which suprised me.  They 
may be okay, but I wanted factory original Bosch.  On to BMW/Volvo - 
bingo.  Got a 90-amp internally regulated 2-wire Bosch alternator from an 
'86 BMW 325i.  The Volvos had Bosch 100-amp alternators that were very 
similar, but the case was the same size and the pulley on the Volvo was 
smaller so I went with the BMW 90-amp version which should be plenty for 
me.  For giggles I walked through the Asian section but did not find 
much.  Mostly serpentine-pulley, mostly buried under other accessories, and 
very small.  Unsure of output.  They also had about 5 wires going in/out 
which means I would have to hit the books to figure out how to wire one 
up.  I liked the small size but otherwise I wasn't excited about them.

Some gravy - stumbled on a 914 with an alternator assembly (alternator, 
cover plate, wiring harness and newer intact rubber cooling elbow) just 
sitting in the passenger seat.  Got that for another $8 without even 
getting my hands dirty.  Would have been a perfect day but I lost my 
cellphone somewhere in the yard.  Someone is probably calling Guadalajara 
with it right now.

Gonna fire up the MIG welder, make up some brackets and get my bus 
energized with 145 amps of wire-melting power - yes!
