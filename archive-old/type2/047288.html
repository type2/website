&gt;Questions:  Could it be that the engine locked due to: 1.  It has been
&gt;setting for 3 weeks and the engine is internally binding up?  

If it was under a tarp outside in high humidity, could be rusty inside.

2.  The oring
&gt;is binding up, inside the flywheel? 

Don't think so.

3.  The front seal is binding on the
&gt;flywheel? 

Highly unlikely. 

4.  The stud that was replaced is in too far, or something *daaa*
&gt;and binding the engine somehow? 

Nope.

5.  The starter is binding up on the
&gt;flywheel? 

Loosen the starter for a quick check.

6.  Any thoughts, ideas, from you all,  before I pull it again,
&gt;would be greatly, appreciated....

Check your crankshaft end play. If there is none we can hope you didn't
tweek the thrust bearing or case. Perhaps you misplaced the adjustment shim/s.
