Subject: Re: [T2] How do I mount this thing??? - I'm done.

My message was never meant to be a slam. I noticed
several email that were sent from Ron regarding other
T2 users questions and so I sent 2 emails. At no time
did I get a response that the email was received and
that an answer was being researched. I know that they
are busy, but if there is time to respond to random
Type 2 questions, then why not a simply &quot;I will get
back to you on that&quot; to me?

I guess it just added insult to injury since shipping
took so long and I was not given any notification as
to that delay either.

As I stated before, I still intend on purchasing
things from BD and I appreciate the personal response
Ron, but it seemed like my concern was less of a
priority due to the time it took for it.

I love deadlines. I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by.
