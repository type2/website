I have mine on the #3 cyl plug between the plug washer and the plug. I get a 
reading of 350 degrees after a drive of 10 miles at 3000 rpm, around 75 or 
so mph.  Is this abnormaly high? The oil is between 180  190. The pressure 
is 40 at that speed ,oil temp,cyl temp. Is this ok or am I out of the 
ballpark for my 79 Bay with the 2.0 L?  Thanks,  Cree 79 Bay BlueBlob
