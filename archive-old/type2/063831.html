Subject: Re: Light grey paint mix (was FSs and other Qs)

Michael Heron asked:
&gt;Also does anybody know where to get a mixing code or a close
&gt;match for a Light Grey (Licht Grau?) paint for my 1960 Kombi
&gt;(i would like to do some touch ups)

The International Vintage Volkswagen Magazine published colour mixes for VW
Light Grey (L345) (introduced in 1958). For some reason they published two
mixes; one relating to the paint colour by name and the other to the code
- -- I don't know why.

Anyway, here they are:
Light Grey:
1051 White 90.6%
1052 Black 4.2%
1053 Ochre 4.8%
1069 Dark Green 0.4%

L345:
1051 White 90.0%
1052 Black 3.8%
1053 Ochre 6.0%
1069 Dark Green 0.2%

These were based on VW mixing colours. Today's standard mixing colours may
differ slightly so it's best to cross check against an unfaded bit of the
original paint.

Hope that's of use.
