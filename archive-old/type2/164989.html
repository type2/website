Subject: RE: [T2] Bentley manual for '73

&gt; Being as how the best shop in my city has no Bentley 
&gt; manual for T2, and wants a ridiculous price to import one,
&gt; I suppose I should chance my credit card details to the 
&gt; Mass. publisher. for a '73, the nearest I can find on their 
&gt; website is a '74, viz.
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.bentleypublishers_dot_com/product.htm?code=r274
&gt; 
&gt; 	Or am I overlooking a better item?



No, that's an owners manual. Here's the one you need. We are an authorized
Bentley distributor, but we discount their titles, and we ship to New
Zealand regularly.
