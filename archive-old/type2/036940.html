Subject: Westy tow hitch

Hello,
I am looking for a tow hitch for my 1973 Westy.  Had a lead on one from
someone on the list but never heard from them again.
If you have one that you are willing to part with please email me
directly with cost and shipping info.
Thanks,
Al

73 Westy
68 Sunroof  Beetle
