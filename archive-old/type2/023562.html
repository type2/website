Subject: Exhaust studs and heat exchangers
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com, type2-digest_at_lenti.type2_dot_com


&lt;&lt; Help,
 
     I just put on some new heater boxes that i purchased from Nikki Elco and
 they aren't sitting right against the engine.  I think my old studs that
 come out of the engine may have been bent and are holding the heater box
 from fitting exactly up against the engine.  I can feel air shooting out
 from around the exausht manifold.  I think i am going to replace the old
 studs and get new gaskets.  Does anyone have any tips for me or help.
 
 This is the second time i put these guys on and it is worse instead of
 better. If someone knows of the best place to get the studs and gaskets i
 would really appreciate it.

Jason,

You may want to pickup some 9mm and 10mm studs.  Every type4 motor I've seen 
has 9 or 10s, I've never seen 8s, even on my all original never molested '74 
engine, I found 9s.  The end that sticks out is 8mm and the other end is 
either 9 or 10.  If your 9mm studs have pulled out, you can drill out the 
hole tap new threads and insert a helicoil and use 9mm studs again, or you 
can tap the hole with a 10mm tap and use the oversized 10mm stud.  I've had 
the best luck with the helicoil.  If your studs are bent, you will be able to 
tell when you remove them.  You can also compare the angle of the studs to 
each other without removing them.  If they are pulled out, you won't be able 
to tighten them.

If your heads were like the ones on my rebuilt, rebuilt GEX motor, then the 
studs are already all oversized to 10mm.  If these studs pull out, you're in 
trouble.  Here is a little trick that I used.  Carefully remove the stud, and 
insert a helicoil.  Do not drill or tap the hole, just insert the helicoil 
along what's left of the original threads.  Now you should be able to use the 
9mm studs.  I coated mine with JB Weld to make sure they would stay in place. 
 I let them sit overnight and installed my exchangers and this has lasted now 
for about 6 months.

Now for installing the exchangers.  As suggested, get new gaskets.  Make sure 
the gaskets are seated properly and I used high temp sealant to stick them in 
place. (head side only)

Next mount your exchangers and tighten the nuts down just a tad, alternating 
to get an even tightness. You want to leave the exchangers just a tad loose 
until you have your exhaust mounted.  You can then go back and slowly tighten 
all of  your nuts a little at a time, including the exhaust.  This should 
seal up your exchangers and get rid of most of your exhaust leaks.  Check 
Bentley for the proper torque.

The truth is, that most type 4s have leaky exhausts.  With the poor original 
design and poor fitting after-market parts, it is very difficult to keep 
these sealed up.
