Subject: Last call for 78' Westy Front seats

I am now offering these seats to anyone who will pickthem up. (Arlington
VA). They are in decent shape but if I was going to put them in my bus I
would recover/ refoam them. Call or P-mail meif you want them. Otherwise
they are going to be thrown away. I hate to throw out Bus stuff but I live
in a townhouse with very little storage and my better half is complaining
about the body parts in the livingroom...


PS. I could maybe deliver them if you live close to Arlington.
