Subject: Boltless in Augusta...

Is there anyplace that sells a general box of replacement metric fasteners
suitable for buses?

In particular, I need one of the pair that holds the slider latch in place
on the slider door rear end.  One's missing, and the door will not close
completely when it latches.  Bit of a draft...

I'm going to try the wrecking yards this weekend.

(Richard, your package got here today.  I'll try the regular resins, but the
new one coming out soon may work better.  I've got a sample to try it with.
I'll let you know how it works out.)
