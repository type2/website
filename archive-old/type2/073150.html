Subject: Re: downshift strategy
Message-Id: &lt;v03110707b34f096b02f9_at_[24.95.99.144]&gt;

&gt;I own 3 acs and have trouble downshifting into second on all three.  I've
&gt;read here on the list that one should rev the engine to facilitate this
&gt;downshift.  My question involves the target rpm for such a rev. Is one
&gt;trying to match some rpm exactly?  Or is it enough to get the rpm above
&gt;some value?

Some of us have no synchros left and have to double-clutch in every gear
(it's called double-clutching)--you're hunting for the place where the
transmission's speed matches the engine's speed so they'll fit together
without gnashing. There is no set rpm for this, it depends how fast you're
going and what gear you're shifting into.

Put it in neutral, disengage the clutch, then &quot;throw&quot; the engine rpms up to
where the trans rpms are. Then engage the clutch and the thing will slip
into gear without complaint. There's a feel to it, you'll get it once you
practice some.
