Subject: Exhaust Header/Muffler question

My Friends,

I have this non-stock header on my '70 loaf, and the muffler component
is shot.  I've been searching high and low for a replacement muffler to
no avail.  It seems that the flange where the muffler connects to the
header is triangular with the point on the top, and a flat bottom.  All
the replacement mufflers I've found have a triangular flange that looks
like it's pointing to the left with the flat on the right side.

Anyone have a suggestion (or even know what I'm talking about)?  How can
I identify the header I have?  Where would I find a replacement muffler
for this header?

Thanks,

--
