&gt; Volk-a-maniacs,

ok it has been some years since I had a 60 and then a 65 I now have the
much more complex 78
&gt; 
&gt; BACKGROUND:
&gt; I just had my '63 in the shop to get a checkup after ~400 miles after my
&gt; engine rebuild, plus a few quirks I wanted him to work out for me.  Quirks
&gt; PROBLEM:
&gt; I picked her up today, sounds great, looks great, feeling good, take off.
&gt; Less than a mile away, she just plain stops running.  WTF?  I pull over on the
&gt; busy road and try to start it again, thinking maybe some kind of fuel bubble
&gt; the cab, filling with smoke.  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!

oppps, unfortunately been there done that
&gt; 
&gt; I make sure everything is turned off (I only had the key on to begin with, no
&gt; lights, no blinker, no nothing) and head back the mechanic.  Luckily the wife
&gt; was following still.  We get Annie back to the shop with a tow rope as the
&gt; 
&gt; PREPARING FOR WORST CASE:
&gt; In the mean time, I read through the archive and Wiring Works seems to come up
&gt; often when people are looking to get a new wiring harness.  What kind of
&gt; prices am I looking at?  Should I just call Rod (thanks for the pointer on the
&gt; VintageBuss_dot_com wiring page Thom).  WW has them for $289 (ouch).  Does the
&gt; group have an opinion on which might be better?  Who else might have them and
&gt; can provide a good one?
&gt; 
&gt; Looking ahead, what kind of time frame can a moderately intelligent person get
&gt; this done in.  A day?  Two weeks?  Never, it requires a very intelligent
&gt; person?  I want to drive her up to Puyallup next weekend.  Anyone think I can
&gt; do this?

the problem is that a 63 bus wiring system probably has very little
resemblence to the one it left the factory with, years and years of
&quot;repairs&quot; have probably left it a tangled mess.  

I new wiring harness is likely to drive you to drink getting it installed
right, or at all...that being said it might be the best solution, but I
wouldn't count on getting it done in any particular time
frame...intelligence is probably not really a factor, but being meticulous
is, step by step, take the Dr Tim DM to the limit and go a little beyond
and you get the idea.  

I've been upgrading mine, one wire at a time, slower but at least I know
where to look when I have a problem, put one wire in, get it working
right, then put in the next wire etc etc  very slow process but seems the
only alternative to the total transplant and ensuing complications 

 
&gt; Send me your extra karma, I could use some on this bus right about now.

good luck

Bob
