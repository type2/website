Subject: Jalousie Window Repair

Hello Fellow Partially Eaten Fish, ( sorry, that commercial cracks me up) 
Anyone out there had any experiance with rebuilding/tightening up the 
jalousie windows in their Westys? I've got a ' 78, and those jalousies are 
ja-loosie big time. Seems that the rivits are worn out, and there is mucho 
slop in the crank aparati, which translates into entirely too much rattling 
and banging about whilst on the road.( The window assemblies themselves are 
tightly mounted and sealed to the body of said bus) It looks to be a pretty 
straight forward procedure, but I just thought I'd query the List for any 
hints, tips, pitfalls, etc... Already checked the Library and Archives, but 
not much is related to the topic at hand. TIA.
