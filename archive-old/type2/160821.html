&gt;Most of the time with small stuff--demand first class or priority mail
&gt;shipping.
&gt;
&gt;If it's under a pound it'll cost $.4.05 for priority, and cheaper yet
&gt;for first class.

Neither vendor would take this option. They all prefer UPS/Fedex for various reasons they will give.

For all the talk about lost packages and tracking, USPS gives better service everytime. And far better on price under certain weight limits (although if you can fit it in their flat rate box for $8.10 they win again).
