...well, one wheel actually. Driving home from Stowmarket, the wheel bearing
that had been noisy for a while finally let go. Result, we pull into a service
station, stop and then I notice lots of smoke coming from the front nearside
wheel. Behind the wheel, the odd little flame is visible. I emptied my fire
extinguisher (.6kg, I know it will be replaced &amp; have a big brother as well)
onto the back off the wheel and apart from loads of heat there was no more
flame.

Called the breakdown people who put Ashley on the back of a lorry and dropped us
off at home (3 hour trip at 60-80mph with the van on the lorry backwards - is
this the fastest &amp; longest reverse by a T2 - or do some of the wheels have to be
on the road to count :-)  ). The heat had gone by the time the lorry arrived (40
mins, just long enough to eat at the service station :-) ). No pools of liquid
evident or any damage visible through all the powder from the extinguisher.

The question. When the wheel comes off, what can I expect to find ? What were
the flames likely to have been ? The van was running fine except from a little
bearing noise and an odd smell (for around 15miles) put down to the heating
system which was working very well but can smell a bit sometimes.

I assume I will need to replace-

The bearing - had planned for both sides anyway
The brake pads
The brake fluid
The rubber hose containing same
Possibly the speedo cable if the outer casing is melted.

Anything else ? How robust is the disk/calipers likely to be ?

I haven't had the wheel off yet, though it better to work in daylight. The other
problem is I will be farming out the job to my mechanic due to lack of
time/ability/special tools/inclination to do this job but that means the van has
to move about a mile &amp; a half so at least the brakes will need to partially work
- any ideas ? There wasn't a pool of liquid so I assume it will be there even if
a little boiled, haven't tried the brakes apart from the handbrake yet.

Thanks
