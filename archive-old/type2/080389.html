Subject: Re: [T2] Air Breathers on Heads??

Chris:
IIRC, the heads with breather holes were from 914's or VW 411's. Not a big
deal. the hoses went to the air cleaner and ended up dumping blowby back
into the oil bath air cleaner. I've got one of those air cleaners
someplace from a 411, if anyone needs it or just wants to know more. Pmail
me.

&gt;
&gt; So whoever had my 73 transporter before I did clamped
&gt; and sealed the two breathers that come from my heads
&gt; at the rocker arm assemblies. I'm doing a complete
&gt; rebuild and don't know where these pipes were
&gt; connected to. He also removed the air injection pump.
&gt; So I don't have one at all. What's going on?? Are
&gt; there good reasons why he did this!? Could this be the
&gt; cause of his blowing a head gasket?
