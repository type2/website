Subject: [T2] holey sand blasters...

Gentlepersons-
                       A fair overview of paint/rust removal is available at 
&lt;www.minimania_dot_com&gt; .  Scroll down the left side and click on the paint 
removal article.
Various do's and don't's for the DIY. I picked up a cheap sand blaster at a 
garage sale and
it was worth about what I paid - $5. Sand all over the place, despite the 
&quot;cabinet&quot;. A buddy of mine jury-rigged a vacuum attachment to a similar 
set-up and that works bet-
ter but not ideal, either.
