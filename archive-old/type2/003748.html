Hello List
Since I'm new you might not remember me asking about a 72 Westy we might
get, no luck yet but where still hopping. Any how I saw a post last night
where someone mentioned it took about two hours to drop a 72 up engine and 4
to put back in. &quot;sorry for not getting your name before I deleted your mail&quot;
So I was wondering is this typical? I can have my 64 Single Cab engine on
the floor in 20 minutes from the time I pull in the garage. Ok I know this
is a DUMB QUESTION but do the bays have the removable rear apron? I have
never worked on a bay yet, &quot;kinda  obvious huh&quot; so I have never found out.
It makes life so much easier to pull the engine strate back and out. Also
apples to apples how much harder or easier is it to work on a pancake
engine? Is their tons of differences between an upright and the pancake?
Thanks for wadding thru my bay newbie questions, I do appreciate any help
that can be given.

And can all of you give a thought to the Karma gods that the guy who has the
72 Westy will get off his butt and sell us this bus, thank you!
