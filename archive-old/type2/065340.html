&gt;&gt;*He* says: the 009 is strictly a racing distributor, St. Muir
&gt;&gt;notwithstanding. It has a terrible advance curve for everyday driving. *He*
&gt;&gt;says, stick with the stock distributor, which I think in your case is the
&gt;&gt;centrifugal/vacuum advance, which *he* calls &quot;the best distributor VW ever
&gt;&gt;made.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;*he* sounds like a really smart feller!  Down with the 009!

Right, the 009 has it's place, and that's not on every VW, otherwise
VW would've put it there in the first place as i can imagine that the 009
is a lot cheaper than a C+V advance distributor. Stil ,everyone who wants
to get rid of his/her 009, send it to me ;)
