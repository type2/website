Subject: Heater Box Exhaust pipes?

I was just told that my ' 78 Westy originally came with &quot;heater box exhaust 
pipes&quot;. Mine seem to be missing. There is nothing on the heater boxes that 
looks like an exhaust pipe, just a hole in the top of the control boxes to 
vent out the hot air when the control flapper is off. Is someone pulling my 
leg, or are the boxes really susposed to have there own exhaust pipes. If so, 
why? And do I really need them? The guy who told me this said that they help 
to keep the engine from over-heating. Thanks for the help.
