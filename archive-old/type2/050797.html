Subject: [T2] RE: Welders

&gt; I followed a pretty extensive thread on the another elist
&gt; recently and the best advise I got was to look at 220v units.
&gt; Here an explanation why:

Funny you should say this. Since our mains voltage is 230 Volts already
(Europe) people here claim you really need a 380 Volts unit to do
professional work.

I believe the difference is not so much the voltage (although it is true
what you write about currents etc) but the fact that 380 (or 220 in your
case) is a 3-phase supply which gives a smoother DC current for welding.
