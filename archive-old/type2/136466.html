No disagreement, Jack.  I was merely commenting that an ounce scale, even
at .1 ounce is not fine enough for proper balancing.  There is usually
also a problem at the top end, since many have a maximum load of 16
ounces, which is marginal for rods.  If you have one or can afford it,
Ohaus is definitely the way to go.  Otherwise look for a gram scale
accurate to at least a gram with a kilogram capacity.

OOK!
