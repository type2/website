Subject: Re: [T2] Charging a battery in sitsu

&gt; Battery DEAD - 8 months old.  Probably some amperage drain caused this.

Any liquid left inside?

&gt; Question:  What might be wrong/bad/danger of  attaching a 10 amp Battery
&gt; Charger to the starting battery while the battery is still connected to the
&gt; system.

It doesn't matter that the battery is connected. What matters is that the
battery just sits there, overcharges and then wastes away to nothing.

The general rule of thumb is not to use a charged with output greater than
1/10th the Ah rating of the battery. What kind did you use?

&gt; For some reason, this is not helping to start the VW.
&gt; Should the deep cycle battery kick in to take over from the passenger side
&gt; battery??

Not behind a battery relay.

&gt; Also, should I disconnect the fully charged deep cycle battery while I am
&gt; charging the passenger side battery?? (Yes/No - vote now!!)

Yes.
