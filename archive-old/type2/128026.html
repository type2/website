&gt; Tow it back here and drop the engine and order a rebuild from a place
&gt; like BAP or another shop recommended by the list?

Having been severely reamed on a long-distance engine repair (not a VW,
but painful nonetheless) I recommend that you tow the vehicle home and
deal with it yourself.  Unless you know the remote shop really well you
are taking a big risk that they will tear things down and then try to up
the bill on you.  If you can borrow a pickup and rent a tow dolly getting
it home won't be all that difficult.
