Subject: VIN numbers - what do they mean

So I'm looking at a bus - the VIN is 2222164407 what's this mean - what =
year is it?  That number is on the metal strip on the dash - so that =
would be the same as the number behind the passenger sear right?  And I =
suppose that number would be in the engine compartment right? The bus is =
- I think a deluxe - it has a type 4 motor - I only see one carb in the =
engine compartment - I'd really like to know the year and the seller =
doesn't know - I really wanted a bay with a type 1 engine but the body =
of this is just too nice to pass up - and it comes with loads of westy =
stuff.

Is the engine compartment in all bay window buses the same size? =20

it is sooo easy with early buses.

TIA
