Subject: Hoses that fall apart w/newgas

I am told by a reliable source that in order to stop &quot;newgas&quot; rot
on your fuel lines:

Get some lines that are used for boats.  They are hardier and must
put up with different gasolines/salt-fresh water etc.  Sounds like
a dandy idea, if your hoses are getting hosed... !
