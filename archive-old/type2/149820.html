&gt; I have Bently and read it all (not in the best environment with 2

&gt; you saying that the right carb can be adjusted further back from the
&gt; postion with no adjustment rod attached? I did not try that....?

If you are at the end of the adjustment I think you'll have to adjust the
throttle stop on the carb and until the rod is in the center of its movement
for maximum adjustabilty either way.

&gt; As to the 13mm nut.......? Nothing like that on the 74 carbs, the only
&gt; adustment according to Bently is the rod with the lock nuts.....? ( I
&gt; think )

Sorry. The 73-74 carbs only have the one adjustment via that rod.
