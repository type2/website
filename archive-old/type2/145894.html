Subject: Re: [T2]Led Alarm Light

Make sure you do something to disable your van. I work in Richmond VA and  
I've seen cars  with alarms going off while moving down the street. So  don't 
count on just lights. Disconnect the battery or unplug the coil. I  wouldn't do 
a fuel shut off. The carb bowl holds enough to get the van down the  road. Go 
to Harbor Freight and get one of those wheel locks. They clamp onto the  wheel 
and don't let it move. Not the steering wheel the rim.
