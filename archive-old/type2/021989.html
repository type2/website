Subject: Classic Christmas tree Island Camp

    Just got off the phone with Rich Yost (VTO) owner of Christmas Tree
Island, site of the Classic weekend Friday night camp-out. He has put out a
request to all buses camping there to bring a TREE to plant, help preserve
Christmas Tree Island, as Rich does of old buses. Christmas Tree Island is
called that because it was a Christmas tree farm at one time and all the
existing trees are dieing due to there age, so to help preserve this
Beautiful spot to camp bring a TREE, any kind and size as long as it will
grow in So Cal.

   For those that are wondering what Christmas tree Island is, it is 5 acres
in Yucaipa, Cal owned by Rich Yost, There is a 3000 square foot barn full of
old buses and parts with a few dozen more buses hidden around the property.
It is located with in a 30 minute drive of the OCTO show and is one of the
largest Busavans ever, last year I would estimate over 1 mile long, it IS a
site to see and be part of. Anybody looking for a place to CAMP on Friday
night are more then welcome, be part of 30-50 plus BUSES and there owners
camping out before the big weekend. For more info go to
http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/shows/.

Ronnie   3 weeks till the fun begins

ps. I will be leading/taking anybody who wants to go to West Coast Classics
industry party on Friday afternoon and leading those that go directly there
back to Christmas Tree Island, if you have never been to Lenny's shop it IS
a must do.
