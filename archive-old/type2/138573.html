Subject: Correct dizzy 71 dual port?

Listees,

I just can't figure out what is the correct stock dizzy for my dual port on 
my 71. I know it's a single vacuum right? But does anyone have the three 
digit number for which one is correct? What vacuum dizzys will work and what 
do I time them at if it's not the stock dizzy??

I want to try one and try timing it at the 5 ATDC (or whatever it is for 
this dizzy) like you are supposed to do with a stock dizzy and see how that 
changes how well it runs.

Thanks,

Daniel
