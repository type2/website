Subject: cyber club??
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hello all,

 Being that this is friday, I hope this is ok. I would like to know if the
type 2 owners in the Oklahoma, Kansas, Western Arkansas, SW Missouri, and
North Texas would be interested in developing a cyber club. The purpose of
this club would be to promote get togethers, mostly in Oklahoma and to get
together on IRC for chats. If you are interested, contact me via e-mail,
not the list.

Bus Content:

I wrote awhile back about my bus getting repainted and, although not show
quality, the bus looks 100% better!!!! At least the next time Mike Ginsler
and I park next to each others, mine will match his!!!!
