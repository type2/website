Subject: Re: [T2] Gross Polluters-what of RV's?

Yes - there is/was a list devoted to it too. I read it for a while.

Lots of money invested in that little car. If it really worked it would be 
a great commuter car power source for us small town commuters. I'd drive 
one in a Beetle body.

The list was nothing but conjecture in my opinion - nobody knew anything 
about the car for sure.

I finally got bored and quit.

&gt;Speaking of that, whatever happened to the &quot;compressed air&quot; car?
