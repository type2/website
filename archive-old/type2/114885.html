Subject: RE: [T2] Distributor and vacuum advance

I understand the info below, but this is only for the 74. I have a 73 that,
I assume, just uses a regular vacuum advance distributor. 

So what are the advantages to using a vacuum advance distributor over a 009?
I see none since the vacuum advance does not seem to do anything until 4th
gear or when it is cold, according to the manual.

Also, does anyone use this vacuum advance cutoff on their buses? Mine was
not hooked up, so I figure that this means that my distributor is using
vacuum advance all the time?

The 74 dizzy is a dual vacuum unit distributor. It times at 10 degrees after
because it has manifold vacuum
connected to the retard side. This gives you 16-18 degrees of retard timing.
As soon as you open the throttle, manifold vacuum drops close to zero. The
spring in the vacuum unit overcomes
the low vacuum and you get an instant 16-18 degrees of advance. This brings
your timing back to about 7.5
degrees before TDC.
