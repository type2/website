&gt; Hello,
&gt; I have a 78 bus and recently I have been smelling a lot of gas when I
&gt; fill up.
&gt; I noticed it dripping the last fill.

I'm a bit slow here and you may have it sorted already but I had the
same problemafter my nearest and dearest got the petrol pump nozzle
stuck in the filling hole.
Fancy that! I've been around cars for 30 years and its the first time
I've ever seen
that (told her so as well :) )

What happend though, was that the rubber elbow piece that fits
immediately inside
the entrance to the filling hole cracked and when I filled it right up I
used to get fuel
dripping on the ground.  I got the smell all the time and after a while
I think it started
to poison my system or something as I smelled this strange smell all
over the place.
Now I just smile and stare a  lot.

You could probably check it by feeling with your finger.  Replacing it
is not too big a deal.

Roger
