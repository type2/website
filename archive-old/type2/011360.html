There was a type 2 with a diesel engine in it at the
midwest Renewable Energy Fair, in Madison, Wisconsin,
in June of this year.  I have the fellow's card and
some info somewhere and I will attempt to find it to
pass it along.  He was talking in the range of $5000
or so, if I recall correctly, for the complete
conversion.
