Subject: [FRIDAY]  And the survey says...
Message-ID: &lt;37589680.147ACCC8_at_eoni_dot_com&gt;

Okay, I just completed a survey of the platforms used by Vanagon owners on the
vanagon_at_gerry list.  Now it's the Type2 listmember's turn.  So...

Send me (mailto:jrasite_at_eoni_dot_com, not the list!) the platforms you use.  I'll
collate and report back next Friday.
