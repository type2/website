Subject: Paint shops?

Ok dudes

I'm doing a complete restoration on my 65 including everything. I mean we're
talking windows out, pop top off, suspension out, front end and rear end out,
engine out, the whole nine. What I'm wondering is this: does anyone know any
respectable paint/body shops in the Washingtone area, preferably close to
Seattle, that have experience with busses. This is my baby we're talking about,
my first car, and I GOTTA do this right! Any help would be DynoMite!
