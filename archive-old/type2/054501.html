I would also suggest the idiot guide by muir, its worth
having around. Since it sounds like your in a hurry
check here at the type2 library.

Static timing is ok for emergency's but pickup a timing
light, about $30. hope that helps

good luck
Alex,

I took out the distributor on the 71.  It was not where i wanted it to be so
i seriously must of just wacked it out of timing!  None the less I need to
get this puppy timed as the roadtrip is already planned.  It is not starting
at all only turning over.  What can I do to time it statically?  I need
detailed instructions!!
