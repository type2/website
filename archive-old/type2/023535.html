I've searched the archives and found some good basic tips but nothing
specifically related to the problem I'm facing. I'm hoping someone else has
seen this.

Got a '71 more-or-less Westy that is almost completely unoriginal and
plug-ugly to boot. Gawd, I love it so. A few months ago the original DC
generator went to the Great Swap Meet In The Sky and I took the opportunity
to upgrade to an AC alternator (Bosch). Removed the voltage regulator, and
replaced the stand,  shroud mounting plate, fuel pump and oil fill in order
to make everything fit. Wiring was simple and went without a hitch. She
started on the first try and charges at a beautiful 13.8 VDC.

However. She won't hold a charge for more than a few days now. I could park
her for a month before this conversion and start her up with no trouble. Now
if I wait more than about three days I need to jump her.

I know that an alternator (unlike a generator) needs some power in order to
make power. Is it possible that this drain is on all the time? I've checked
for voltage at the exciter connection with the ignition off and the test
light stays dark. Or is the new alternator possibly bad? Shorted somewhere?
I do not believe that the battery (about a year old) has suddenly gone bad.
I haven't made any other changes recently so I'm assuming that this is
related to the upgrade (such as it is so far) and not to any of the slew of
possible short-circuits described in the archives. The only 'at rest'
voltage drains are the stereo/clock and a faux alarm/blinking LED (a running
joke with my friends). These have not been a problem for the last few years.

For now I have it tiny-trickle-charging in the driveway. In a day or three
I'll check the voltage with and without the battery connected, or
buy/borrow/steal an ammeter and see if there's a drain while she's turned
off. In the mean time, anybody have any tips or personal experience to
offer?
