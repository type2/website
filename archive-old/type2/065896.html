Subject: Installing VDO Tach

This is how I installed a tachometer in my '77 VW Westy in the &quot;clock
pod&quot; (to right of speedometer; my van just had a blank plate there).

Warning: These instructions are not idiot-proof. I'm recalling this
from doing it over a year ago. I'm neither a mechanic nor an auto
electrician. Please don't use these instructions unless you can apply
them intelligently; ie, I've probably done something that can be
improved on so I expect you to read carefully, spot my mistakes, then
not repeat them. Do the wiring wrong and it could ruin your day. You
may want to wait until wiser people on the list have read this and
commented on any dubious practices. Have I been discouraging enough yet?

Encouragement: I've had no trouble with the tach since I installed it.

Parts:

1   3 1/8&quot; VDO Tachometer, Cockpit Style;
1   Tachometer Adaptor Ring from RMMW or other supplier;
1   25 foot length of 14 gauge wire( could be shorter);
1   4 foot length of red 16 gauge wire;
1   4 foot length of green 16 gauge wire;
4-6 Zip Ties;
1   &quot;Connector Doubler&quot; (my terminology, Radio Shack calls them
    &quot;Single Female to Dual Male Quick Disconnects,&quot; six to a
    package, part # 64-3061)
11+ .25 inch Crimp On Quick Disconnects; male, female, insulated,
    uninsulated, for various gauges of wire.
?   Electrician's Tape or Duct Tape
?   Heat Shrink Tubing
?   Plastic Tubing


Run Wire:

Run 14 gauge wire from engine compartment under vehicle then into
cockpit. I started with 25 feet, then trimmed off about 9 feet when
finishing up, so you may want to start with less. (The trimmings from
the wire could be used to finish the connections under the dash, but I
used other wire with some elementary colour coding, like red=hot,
green=ground.) (I actually ran three 25 foot lengths: one for tach;
one for oil temp dipstick sender; and one for an oil pressure sender
which hasn't been installed yet.) You may want to wrap the wire with
electrician's tape or protect it in some other manner. (List people
have suggested using plastic tubing as a conduit.) If this wire shorts
out, it will stop the engine. Under the vehicle, I secured the wire in
various places with zip ties so it wouldn't dangle or rub on moving
parts. I ran the wire down the left side of the vehicle, coming into
engine compartment via grommet already installed for other wiring. The
access plate up front protecting the pedals will have to be removed to
run the wire into the cockpit, following other wire into cockpit. The
driver's side kick panel in the cockpit will have to be removed to run
the wire up to the dash. Later, I realized the wiring harness runs
along the right side of the vehicle. I don't know which side is
better. You may want to give some thought to this.

Intall Tachometer in Instrument Panel.

Before you start this part, disconnect the battery ground strap.

Installing the tachometer in the &quot;clock pod&quot; from behind makes it look
like VW installed it. The adapter ring (from RMMW and others) is the
easiest way to do this. Remove the knobs for the heating and fresh air
controls. There are four screws holding the instrument panel to the
dash on my '77 van. These screws thread into spring clips (Figure 13-2
in Electrical System section in Bentley). Undo the screws only far
enough to loosen and turn the spring clips so they don't grip the dash
(tip from Haynes) then the instrument panel can be lifted away from
dash. Don't pull the panel out too far or you will disturb wires to
the other instruments. If you remove the spring clips from the screws,
especially on the tach side, it will be difficult to put them back on.
I didn't know this until after I installed the tach, so had to 'will'
my hand into position to get the tach side clips back on the screws.

With instrument panel loose, remove the blank plate, put tach in place
with adapter plate around it. As I remember, I re-used the bolts that
were securing the blank plate to hold the adaptor ring and tach in
place. Align the tach the way you want it and tighten the bolts.

Tachometer Electrical Connections Under Dash:

Leave instrument panel loose to do wiring. I looked at the vehicle's
wiring diagram and decided to get power for tach and light by
patching into wires to the emergency flasher switch, since it is close
to tach, and it is the end of the string for light power, I think. The
wire patches I used allowed me to not disturb the original wiring, so
if I remove what I did, there will be no sign of alteration.

I manufactured each wire patch like this: two &quot;long enough&quot; (18 inch?)
lengths of wire; add to end of one wire a .25 inch male quick
disconnect; add to end of other wire a .25 inch female quick
disconnect. There are insulated male and female quick disconnects
available. You may want them insulated to avoid electrical shorts. The
original power connection to the emergency flasher is insulated, so I
did the same on my wire patch. Feed other ends of both wires into a
thicker gauge female quick disconnect and crimp. (This seems a
insecure method to me. I like to solder all connections like this, but
the quick disconnects I used didn't allow convenient soldering.)
(Later I went back and soldered the connections as best I could. If I
were to do it over again, I'd try to solder right from the start. Flux
wire before it is inserted in disconnect; crimp; heat disconnect and
run 50/50 solder into disconnect; try to avoid melting plastic jacket
on disconnect.)

Remove emergency flasher switch from dash so you can see the wires
connecting to it. Unplug power wire to emergency flasher; plug this
wire into male end of patch just made up; plug middle disconnect of
patch into tach and female end into emergency flasher. I don't
remember which wire that was; I studied the wiring diagram in Bentley
before attempting this. It looks to me now like it was the wire going
to terminal 15. (In general, 15 is hot only when ignition switch is
on. This is what we want.)

Manufacture and install a similar wire patch for light power. Once
again, I don't remember which terminal I used for light power. Study
the wiring diagram and the flasher switch before proceeding. Be
careful. Get your power sources from somewhere else if you are not
happy with my method.

Find 14 gauge wire run under vehicle from engine compartment and up to
dash; install a female quick disconnect on it, then plug it onto tach.

Put emergency flasher switch back in dash.

Ground tach to a convenient place under dash of vehicle. You will need
to ground light for tach as well.

Reinstall Instrument Panel:

Once wiring done, reinstall instrument panel to the dash. This will be
hard because the tach will now partially block access to the spring
clips closest to it. Turn the clips so they once again grip the dash
and tighten the screws. You can do it. Reinstall knobs for heating an
fresh air controls.

Tachometer Electrical Connection In Engine Compartment:

In engine compartment, attach 14 gauge wire to - terminal of coil. All
the connectors on my coil's - terminal were occupied, so I found at
Radio Shack a &quot;connector doubler&quot; that had female connector at one end
and two male connectors at the other. Install a .25 inch quick disconnect
on 14 gauge wire. Remove one of the existing wires to - terminal of
coil, install &quot;connector doubler&quot; onto coil, then connect existing
wire and tach wire to &quot;connector doubler&quot;.

Is that it? I think so. Oh yes, reconnect battery ground strap. Hope
for no electrical fires. Start vehicle and watch tach spring into
action.

I've set the &quot;red&quot; line at 4000 rpm and I'm easy on the gas below 2000
rpm.

I use the tach as much as the speedo, and enjoy it more for having
installed it myself.
