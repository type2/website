The fan easily comes our, one piece of sheetmeyal may have to be removed
also. BE SURE when you reinstall it to torque those bolts, it is not
uncommon to lose a fan otherwise.

&gt; Hey Grant, list
&gt;
&gt; Just took the bus out for a rather crude test. I took a 1 hour run, the
same
&gt; run I had taken several weeks ago under similar conditions. I ran the bus
at
&gt; 70 mph. The earlier readings after one hour were 256 degrees and slowly
but
&gt; steadily rising. Today the temp seemed to level off at about 251 degrees.
&gt; (it's about 93 degrees out today)At 60-65 (normal driving speeds for me)
the
&gt; temps seem to steady at about 230. It seems like a drop of about 5 degrees
&gt; after my fan was cleaned, results preliminary. BTW, after two hours on my
&gt; knees I began to wonder whether or not the fan can be removed without
&gt; dropping the engine. Would anyone happen to know? Bentley didn't clear
this
&gt; up for me. Looks like there are three 12 point socket-head screws holding
it
&gt; on.
&gt; Thanks
&gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt;I thought I'd mention that I just spent a couple hours cleaning the fan
&gt; on
&gt; &gt; my 1700cc type4 engine. It was black and covered with a hard, crusty
&gt; grime.
&gt; &gt; Seemed to me that a clean fan might help the bus run cooler.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hey Rich, I just had the same entertainment.  I figured that if the
&gt; hollows
&gt; &gt; of the blades cake up with gunk, they won't suck as much air.  So we'll
&gt; see,
&gt; &gt; maybe now our fans will be more efficient as well as more attractive.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Regards,
&gt; &gt;
