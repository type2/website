Subject: [T2] Pulling a trailer behind a bus

I too was under the impression that you shouldn't pull much behind your bus
until I met Richard and the Rusty bus.  Richard purchased a 21 window from
me for his wife Dawn.  I am in Kansas, but Richard and Dawn live in
Aridzona.  They pulled the 21 window home behind Rusty bus (and boy is it
ever!) over mountain passes and everything.

In my '76 westy owners manual it states that the bus can pull up to 2300
pounds.  It is much easier on the bus to pull extra weight than it is to
carry it.  With the late model busses, you shouldn't have any problems
pulling, but you should install an oil temp gauge and watch your speed.  If
your transmission is weak and about to go, it will go no matter if you are
towing something, or not.
