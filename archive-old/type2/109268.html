Subject: Re: [T2] baby hammock

&gt; Got a baby coming in about 6weeks, anyone got a cot they want to sell with the metal clips for the body,
thanks Dylan

It depends on the year of your bus [sort of].

68-73: the bars are 56 1/4&quot; long. 68-early 69 are round and black. After that, they became 3 sided and
galvanised. They are stored above the right side cabinet.

74-75 are 57 1/4&quot; long. They are stored under the full width rear seat-bed.

76-79 are 2 piece collapsible. They store under the 3/4 rear seat-bed. You can use the 74-75 bars but they are
tough to store.

The difference in length was not because the 74+ bus is wider [it is not] but because of the location of the
half moons on the A and B pillars. The early buses are mounted higher. The lower you go, the wider the space
between the pillar.  This is what I meant by 'sort of' in the first sentence. The mid 69 to 73 bars are very
common. The 74-75 bars are tough to find. The 2 piece collapsible will fit all years but are next to
impossible to find. All the canvas material are the same from 68 to 79.

Pmail me, I have all but the 74-75 bars.
