Subject: gague panel...

hello,

i cant remember but someone was saying they wanted a multifunction led
panel to replave all teh gagues...

this has many indicators instead of just one, but it looks kinda cool..
you'd ahve to use teh water temp for aoil temp though, and have a water
symbol on yer dash.. yechh ;)
