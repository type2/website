I agree with you Mike, if you're goin' in anyway, take care of business. It's DM and it makes good sense. But it's an imperfect world. I've been hiding from Karl, cuz he told me my valves needed adjustment two months ago and I have shamed myself in not doing it.

I'm just considering the poster's intent, and maybe giving him an easier method if that's the route he chooses. To each his own, and all. He may have the parts for what he wants to do and time scheduled already.

Also, I bought borg/warner injector seals for a few bucks per injector and the fit was poor. The o.e.m. ones are available for more like the 30 dollar range. They will last you another 25 years tho.

Later,

Billy

My spin on this is: going the whole nine yards as I described is really easy, doesn't take too long, and may end up saving you in the long run.  

Injector seals cost a buck or two.
