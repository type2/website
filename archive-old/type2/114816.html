Subject: New bus for me! (long)

Well, I went and bought a '71 Deluxe with 97,000 miles on this past weekend
for $600. It is going to need some work to make it run but, we were able to
get it started even with a weak coil (orange spark when we tested it). We
dropped a set a points and a condenser in it and not having a feeler gauge
we guessed at the gap.  Using the lid from the box the points came in we set
the gap...it was roughly the thickness of a matchbook cover which, I have
heard can be used to set the gap. When I got home, I discovered that the gap
is .016&quot; and I will re-set them on Monday. Finally, after a trip to the
store to get the points and checking the spark we got it to fire up. It runs
but, really rough and will not idle. We had first decided to make an attempt
at driving it home but, with a straight through stinger exhaust on it, it
was just way too noisy. Also, I believe that there is not enough back
pressure to make it run correctly. It was rather comical driving it down the
street with everyone looking at us...I wish I could show you guys the looks
on they're faces! We waved like we were in some kind of parade for burned
out hippies. Challenge one came at the first stop-light when I had to stop
and keep the bus running...needless to say, I failed. She died right there
at the stop light! We sat through two light cycles before we got it started
again...I could feel the other motorists seething at me as they drove
by...it made me laugh. Green light! Go, well more like limp to the gas
station just across the intersection. I wheeled her into the Exxon and under
the canopy, which tripled the sound of the exhaust! I swear it sounded like
being in the pits at a NASCAR function. So, after putting some gas in it we
decided to trailer it home so, I pulled it over to the side of the gas
station and waited for the troops to go grab the trailer. We finally got it
back to the house around 9:00...not to bad, a 20 minute trip in four hours!
On the positive side, it drives great! Good brakes, great tires, steers good
too! 
 Being fairly new to air cooled motors, I have some questions:

Bare in mind the bus has the correct 1600 motor in it.

How do I know what type of coil to use? 
What type of distributor is this? ( I am thinking vacuum advance) I see the
advance unit on the side of the dis.
What do the dizzy numbers mean? And how can I tell what I have? I have seen
050, 009 and 019 ( I think that is right) 
What is the Bosch &quot;blue coil&quot; I see and hear people talking about?
Has anyone ever used the Pertronix Flame Thrower? Is it worth the price for
the upgrade? I am also going to be getting rid of the points and going with
the pertronix electronic ignition...no offense to the purists but, I would
rather spend my time doing something else than setting points every so often

All this is enough to make anyone &quot;dizzy&quot; ha! I couldn't resist.
Any way, that was my Saturday afternoon...thanks for listening.
