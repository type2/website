&gt;for a 6V battery).
&gt;
&gt;Where do you get these things?

Try Sears, or use a golf cart battery.  Despite what some naysayers will
tell you the deep cycle golf cart battery has plenty of cranking amps to
turn over a VW engine and it will outlast a regular 6v battery.  The Trojan
T-105 can be had for around $60, and would be my first choice were I in
your shoes.  It's a little heavy though - your battery tray needs to be in
good shape.
