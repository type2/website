There have been repeated, long-winded discussions on the 911 list
about these.  I'll point out the highlights:

* they do give a firmer pedal feel
* they're originally designed for race cars which get them replaced
more often
* The braids can cut the hose on the inside, so you'd never see the
damage until it was too late
* the DOT approval has to do with the style of fittings and any labelling.
Even if the new hose is superior in design and construction, if it
isn't labelled and has the fittings the book sez, it's not approved
* the general consensus is that they're not worth the extra money, and
most sales are made on the basis of the &quot;cool factor&quot;
* A lot of the big boys with the high dollar cars do NOT use them
* Almost all of the top mechanics recommend against them
* A lot of these hoses are being made in the orient, and the quality
is significantly lower than the german OEM ones.  They're bright and
shiny, but made with inferior materials and workmanship.

If someone could fwd this to vintagvw, that would be cool, cause
I'm not subscribed there.
