&gt; This mirror is probably not an original, as it had the plastic edge molding
&gt; between the mirror glass and the chrome metal housing.

I bought similar mirrors from bus depot several years back.  The metal has
been corrosion-free (much better than the last set) but the plastic bead
has deteriorated badly.  Unfortunately, the lip on mine isn't big enough
to use the fix you detailed.  I'll probably end up installing the mirror
with double-stick foam tape or somesuch.
