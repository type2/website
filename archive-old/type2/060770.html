Subject: Dropped valve seats - rattling valve seats

Just a quick question. My nephew who does Mercedes, Porche, BMW, and Audi
work 
reluctantly admits to working on VW's when things are slow. I asked him why
I can never get
rid of the valve noise on one cylinder on my van. He told me that he once
saw a VW head where 
the valve seat had not only dropped, but was actually loose, and rattling
around in the head.
He said that it would move when the valve opened, and then when the vavle
closed, it would 
pull it back into place. The symptom of this was one loud valve. Even though
the clearance was set right
this one valve still made a racket. Apparently no one including him could
figure it out, until after he had 
the head off, and the valve out. 
Anyone ever heard or seen this? BTW when he listened to mine, he said the
one he was describing was
 WAY louder than mine.
