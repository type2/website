Hi John.

&gt; 1. All of the temperature control insulation aside from one spark plug cover
&gt; seems to be okay - that is tinware, spark plug covers, foam strip around
&gt; engine.

Not a bad start.  Make sure you have a working thermostat and flaps if you
haven't already checked.

&gt; 2. The vaccuum hose from the fuel mixture lines to the air filter has split
&gt; in two. Instead of repairing it, the PO plugged it with a drill bit!!!!!

This does not surprise me at all!

&gt; 3. On the left hand side duct (to the carb) has a fitting on the bottom of
&gt; it. It looks a litle like:
&gt; ________
&gt; &lt; || || &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; where the two || are pipes, and the &lt; and &gt; are clip things of some sort -
&gt; whats this for? Is something supposed to connect to it?

It's a kind of thermostat that passes vacuum, or not, depending on the
temperature of incoming air.  One side should connect to the manifold
pipework under the air cleaner (hard to see with the air cleaner in place).
The other side connects to the diaphragm that controls the position of the
air intake flap (mixes air from near the exhaust manifold - for cold weather
- with air from the engine compartment).

&gt; It was running very rough
&gt; unless I gave it a significant amount of reving - it got better as it warmed
&gt; up (I wasn't driving anywhere - only parked).  Ambient temperature is about
&gt; 10 degrees centigrade, give or take about 3 deg. c (sorry - no idea in F).
&gt; I hope that this is caused by the vaccum line and the choke being right
&gt; open?

Yes, carbed buses don't like it below about 10C with only cold air coming
in.  This sort of behaviour can also be caused by vacuum leaks in general
and all manner of other things like bad timing etc.  Give your bus a good
tuneup: valves, timing, points, plugs etc if anything is unknown about its
previous history.  This will give you a much better idea of what's going on.
