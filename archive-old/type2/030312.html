&gt; Does anyone know whee I can get a set of &quot;Air Non-Return Flaps and Pins&quot; for 
&gt; a '76 type IV.  This is what the Bentley manual ('68-'79) calls them on page 
&gt; 5-21 in Fig 7-3 Item 24.  

Ted,

I am sorry to say that your chances of finding a set are very low.  Nikki
has found 2 sets in all her junkyarding is SoCal.  This is a part that I
am *incredibly* disappointed in the repop community for not doing.  They
are *simple* to make and do actually make a difference in heat at low
RPM's as you say.

WW, Bus Boys?  Are you listening?

&gt; They are the little metal flaps which keep the 
&gt; Heater blower air from blowing back into the fan housing at low RPM's.  Mine 
&gt; are gone and I can't find any at local wrecking yards (or they want me to 
&gt; buy the entire fan housing).

Ted, If you can get them by buying a whole fan shroud, do it!  It is the
only way you wil be finding them!
