Hi James,

First, do a valve adjustment while the engine is cold. Then verify 
dwell and timing. It's not uncommon for the points to close up, which 
would cause the bus to lose power. Or it could be the coil, wires, etc. 
Then check the throttle linkage, I have seen situations where the 
throttle cable stretched out and the bus lost power because the linkage 
wasn't moving properly.

Then do a compression test. This also gives you the opportunity to look 
at the plugs, and will tell you if there's a deeper valve or ring 
issue.

If you have good compression and good spark, it's time to look at the 
fuel system.

Happy trails,

&gt; Im scared to do a compression test when i get back there.
&gt; If the oil was hot and bubbling does that mean bad things
&gt; to the motor?
