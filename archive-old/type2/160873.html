Subject: Re: [T2] Strange Ignition Issue

The distributor is actually relatively new, bought with the last year
from aircooled_dot_net. No significant radial or axial play. Distributor
anti-chatter spring is installed. Vacuum plate moves with suction
applied. I oil the felt pad regularly, and use grease where the points
rub. Haven't disassembled the distributor to check the weights though.
Its sad that my old 009 that came with my bus seems to hold the timing
more steadily. Strangely enough the Bruck SVDA from cip1_dot_com had the
same problem of jumpy timing. What outside the distributor might cause
this?

Just one of those bus oddities I've yet to solve. I would love to
figure out the electrical issue that's preventing the HotSpark module
from correctly functioning.

At least she runs, stops, and gets me reliably to work and back every day.

&gt; I'm guessing that your distributor might be worn out - does the distributor
&gt; shaft have side-to-side (radial) play? Up-and-down (axial) play can usually
&gt; be adjusted with shims added to the shaft. Does the vacuum advance operate
&gt; freely when you suck hard on the vacuum port? Are the centrifugal advance
&gt; weights lubricated and swinging freely in the bottom of the distributor?
