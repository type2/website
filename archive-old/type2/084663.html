This is indeed very good news. I have yet to see the Mexican starters. My 
jobber has only US Bosch Reman/Newman. They never have enough cores for 
demand so you will often find you get a Newman item for the Reman price. 
Either will last like any original German starter in my experience with a 
dozen or so per year. Good to have input from someone doing dozens per week.

I'm watching very closely the stuff from many countries. No problems yet 
with Spain, Israel, Czechoslovakia, looking them over very closely with the 
hand glass and light tech. A few problems with Brazil, and some things from 
Mexico just high school dumb ass shop junk. Their Beetle exterior door 
handles are a joke, as are the handles for Rabbit and the seven other 
models produced for 20 years the same handles fit. Keys and cylinders are a 
joke from Mexico, and the Brazillian locks are but a bit better. Nothing at 
all like the originals in my 30 year old 180kmi T-II. All original locks 
are still functional. Amazing how perfectly they still function after 
cleaning the mechanisms and lubing the latches and pivots. Simple 
maintenance pays big dividends.
