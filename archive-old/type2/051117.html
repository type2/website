Subject: RE: [T2] Bay-window belly pan

One thing I have found is that these pans are often beat up due to there
position on the Bus. The one on my 71 looked like it spent a week on a New
York city street and then installed on the Bus. I found a perfect one on my
73 Donor, but had to cut off a little on the front corner to make it fit. I
find them all the time in good shape here in Washington.

&gt;The front pan is a bit of a &quot;sacrificial lamb.&quot;  The purpose is to protect
&gt;the steering gear from moisture and salt, but in the process of
&gt;protecting, they tend to rust to death young.  If you are in a rust belt
&gt;area, finding one in decent shape is tough.  In salt-free areas, of
&gt;course, they serve no purpose (he said, facetiously) so they are often
&gt;removed and trashed and therefore they are hard to find in those areas as
&gt;well :-( Junkyards are the only source, and they are scarce there.  That
&gt;said, they are very necessary for long life of the bus (and we *are*
&gt;aiming for long life for our buses, right? :-)

&gt;&gt; When doing resto's do a lot of people bother with the belly pan ?

&gt;Well, I do!  As I said above, mechanically they are necessary to protect
&gt;the steering gear from the elements and I tend to aim for mechanically
&gt;sound buses, rather than restorations.  I regard them a necessary. OTOH, I
&gt;live in an area where salt happens, so protecting the steering gear is a
&gt;very good idea :-)
