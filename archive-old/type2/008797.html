Subject: Balanced fans for 1600's, who's using them?

All,

Just wondering who's using those re-welded and balanced
fans that Berg and others offer? I ask because I went
through 3 fans in one year (one lasted a month!!!)
after converting to an alternator on my '69 Westy. YES,
I did change to alternator tin and stand! And Yes, I
did use new German made fans.

Now I have that overly familiar sound that says this
one's shot too! Is it possible that my brand-new Bosch
alternator is at fault? If so, How can I tell?

I had the last fan replaced by a *real* VW mechanic
(hey, I was on a road-trip!!!:-) and asked him the same
thing and he said even the German fans were crap and
that they usually pitch one out of three they receive.

So that brings me to my question... are the balanced
fans any good and are they worth the extra $50.00 and
extra BS?
