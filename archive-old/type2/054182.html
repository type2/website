The rim of the '71 stock pulley is about 7 inches in diameter.

38 amp generator was stock on your bus.  Nothing wrong with an alternator,
though.

&gt; Compared to my '70 bug, the bus' pulley looks smaller and its altenator
&gt; looks bigger than the bug's generator.  Wouldn't that mean that the bus'
&gt; fan is running slower per engine rpm than the bug's, and therefore,
&gt; providing less cooling?
&gt; 
You might have an infamous &quot;Power Pulley&quot;, which will indeed slow your
cooling fan.  I doubt that the alternator pulley is the problem as they
are adjusted to the belt length.  If you're using the correct crank pulley
and a 905X9.5 belt all should be well.  If not, fix it!
