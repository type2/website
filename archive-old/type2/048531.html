Subject: 1979 heater control knobs and guages cluster

After carefull reading of the archives I decided to tackle pulling the
instrument cluster to install a tach that was given to me in the blank for
the clock. I was worried about getting the knobs for the heater/air control
off. From what I read it sounded like a real PIA. I am happy to report that
on the 79 at least those knobs pull right off. After pulling the radio to
get a better look at what I was doing, I noticed little holes in each knob.
With a little effort they pulled right off.
