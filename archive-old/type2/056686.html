Subject: replacing my brake servo...

Hi.

The master cyliner has to be disconnected before removing the brake
servo right? looks like it does... 
Anyone know what that hose on the front part of the brake servo is for
or what it goes to? it seems to dissapear into the side of the bus by
the driver's side door...

Thanks,
Jeff
