Hi-ya!

I haven't written in a while, been agueing with a very strong willed 
VW. you know how that goes (: I found a mechanic to figure out the
mystry problem. It was great to find an honest mech. that didn't rip me
off. *PLUS* he is a bonifide Master w/ certification from VW and all
from germany. He is located in Delaware on old capitol trail.
So i got some time from work magicly and took to the road. I found
myself getting lost and didn't even care. 
I went up towards State collage PA  via 11/15 I saw a great VW flat bed
truck.  I have no idea what year and I caravaned behind the couple for a
while till i had to go.
-- from st. collage i went to Hazletown PA 2 hrs. east on 80  froze me
toes, no heat and boy there really isnt ANYTHING up front. It was like
30 degrees out. When i got to H-town me toes were so cold they were numb
I stayed the night and headed to baltimore. then back home.
 I wanted to stop and say hi to some one from the list but I didn't tell
anyone I was going so scratch it. If you live along that route lemme
know I will do it again. Lorax is running beautifully, It feels good
I'm planning to go to everybus so see ya there.
