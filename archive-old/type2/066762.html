Well.

You gotta love New York City. Went looking for materials to make a
partition yesterday - figured I'd go to Canal Street, where all of the
strange foam and rubber and plastic places are. Sure enough, at
'Industrial Plastics', they have clear vinyl in just about any thickness
for a big $3 per yard! And that's 54&quot; wide! Not to mention that they had
6' statues of liberty, giant plastic lobsters, lots of hilarious 'Lost
In Space' style plastic tubing, aisles and aisles of just strange little
bits of plastic in bins... So I bought about 5 yards of the stuff - I
always buy too much material - some grommets and some of those stick-on
hooks. Today is going to be 'design the partition' day.

Gonna order me a bilge blower from West Marine, too. Can't decide
whether to go with the Atwood or the PAR. Guess I'll flip a coin.

Gonna be headed for Maine in two weeks, so I hope I can get that nice
hot air blowing out of those vents in time.
