Subject: new vs old

Hi
    We just got our 76 bus and need to do some work but know nothing
about anything. I saw the question about new vs old parts and was
wondering the same thing. Are the new parts no good or just more
expensive? Also what would be the best book  or resource to get if you
are just starting out?

    a very curious beginner ..nisha
