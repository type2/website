Anyone in vintagevw land with a passion for ribald flautists care to 
congregate for the Tull concert in Atlanta?  I was thinking perhaps a 
campout; mayhap we can convince Ian to stop by and have a look at 
our Hoover bits.

They also play the following dates/locales, for my SE US friends:

Oct  4 Jacksonville, FL      Florida Theater
Oct  6 Clearwater, FL        Ruth Eckerd Hall
Oct  7 West Palm Beach, FL   Coral Sky Ampitheater
Oct  8 Lake Buena Vista,     House of Blues

The Atlanta venue is Chastain Park.

Cheers,
Joe

ObVW content: I used to play A Passion Play real loud in the 8-track 
in my first Beetle.
