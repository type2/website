Subject: ? on alternate cooling in VW busses:
Message-Id: &lt;199905221106.HAA15258_at_mime3.prodigy_dot_com&gt;

To George Lyle &amp; list:
In discussing  cooling in VW busses, George Lyle and I noted the
uselessness of such evaporative coolers in humid climates (ie, swamp
coolers &amp; spray bottles with fans work in Disneyland but NOT Disneyworld!).....

Well, we DID go to Fla (Key West, ) in August of 96 in the 78 Westy and
survived....the fans I put in the bus (Caframo) helped a lot, one aiming at
each person (I glued plexiglass to the cabinet top and stuck the suction
cups to that)......but Caframo went from a quality motor built in Canada
that DID NOT cause TV interference that I still use after 8 years to one
made in China (got it at Camping World) that  has a smaller motor and
causes interference and lasted one season before being very noisy (bearing
play)....for the electric whizzes here-any idea why/how  a DC motor can be
built that doesn't cause interference?  Isn't it a brushes thing???
