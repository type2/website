&gt;i am not sure what the panel is called

Skye:

The best place to look these things up is the Rocky Mountain Motorworks
Catalog, although there are some inscrutabilities even there.  Those
part numbers are probably most familiar to The Bus Depot people.

If you don't have a copy of the RMMW catalog, you can study the
following sites:

Alan H. Schofield, UK:

    http://www.ahschofield.co_dot_uk/page4.htm

Veng International, Denmark:

    http://www.veng.dk/car/cars/3/6/449.html

Both are in English and both are sources who supply many, if not most,
of the U.S. distributors.
