Subject: Re: [T2] oil leak from big screw in case - what's the tool

That's where the spring for the oil pressure relief valve lives.  If you
look closely at the &quot;slot&quot; in the screw head you'll see that it's not
uniformly deep along its length.  The slot has an &quot;arch&quot; to it, being fairly
shallow at its edges and deeper in the middle.  I think a conventional
screwdriver of any size would be a poor fit.

I made a special &quot;tool&quot; (cheap) for removing and refitting this screw-in
piece for Vanagon engines I've rebuilt.  Go down to your local Ace Hardware
and go back to the section where they keep the Allthread, lengths of rod,
angle iron and so forth.  Get yourself a 1&quot; wide piece of &quot;weldable steel.&quot;
You'll get a 3' section of this mild steel for a couple of bucks.  With a
file, alter one of the square ends of the piece to mimic the slot in the
screw head.  Since this is fairly soft steel that'll just take a couple of
minutes of work.  Make it a good fit.  You'll need to cut of your modified
end so your &quot;tool&quot; is 6&quot; long or so.  Now, holding to tool with vice grips
to give you leverage, you can tighten and loosen this screw head.

Subject: [T2] oil leak from big screw in case - what's the tool


&gt; Have an oil leak from a big srew in piece about 1.5
&gt; inches in diameter just in from of the bottom of the
&gt; oil filter that screws into the case.  Is there a tool
&gt; to tighten or do I just need a gargantuan flat head screwdriver?
