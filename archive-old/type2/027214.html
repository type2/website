whoever cares,
   My fuel sender on my 80 van-o-gone (which is gone) was a chronic
failing part... My 74 also has the fuel sender problem... Karma? Who knows.
I bought a round &quot;hatch&quot; cover at a marine supply house. Cut, not butchered, a
hole over the fuel sender and installed the &quot;hatch&quot;. Now when the the thing decides to
enter the twilight zone on me I just unscrew the O ring sealed insert and replace the damn thing.
The marine hatch is very low profile as it inserts into the hole and the removable insert is
O ring sealed... I also put a RTV seal around the lip of the hatch frame (the female part).
Oh yes... I put a &quot;flammable&quot; sticker on the hatch cover as a precaution in case I ever sell Gunter which
is unlikely... very unlikely. 

                  Peace,
                    Daniel Axel Simmons
