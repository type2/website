Subject: Power-timing problems

Hello:

Saturday I did the usual 6 mo tuneup.  Discovered my timing was at about 20
deg BTDC, wondered at that, set it at the requisite 7.5 (76 westy w/ AFC).
Did the usual stuff, gapped points, checked in on plugs, valves.  Got in
her to drive away, and damned if she didn't have enough power to make it
out of the driveway!  It is very disconcerting to have your bus run bad
_after_ the tuneup, let me tell you.  So anyways, I advance the timing back
to about 20 deg BTDC, and she has the power again, and I seem to remember
doing this in the not too distant past and thinking that I should look into
it and forgetting...

Now I know you're saying so what?  Leave it at 20.  But I don't like that.
She used to run best at 7.5, and it concerns me.  As I write this one
thought comes to mind that I should check and see if the distributor (a
009) is advancing correctly.  Any other ideas?  They would be greatly
appreciated.

Thanks,
Eric
Maggie (who especially thanks you)
