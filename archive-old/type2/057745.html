Subject: Re: Timing strangeness

If you have an idle stabilizer, and didn't remove it from the circuit, 
then the jumping timing mark is what you should see; it indicates the 
stablizer is working.  If you did remove it, or don't have one, then I'd 
guess wear of some sort in the distributor.

&gt; I sat down at my '77 Bus yesterday to check her timing.  I've never done
&gt; this before, so I got comfortable and got my book out.  I clipped the timing
&gt; light on the #1 plugwire, and clipped it to the battery.  My wife started it
&gt; up, and I proceeded to check the timing.  Long and short of it is the timing
&gt; mark oscillates between 8' and 4' BTDC.  I expected to see it pretty steady,
&gt; but mine was jumping around.

&gt; I've also noticed it idoling a bit rougher, and having much less pickup
&gt; these days.  It's a fuel injected model, and I just adjusted the valves.
