I believe you are refering to the the pipe from the EGR (Exhaust Gas 
Recirculation) valve to the throttle body. This is a smog part that
runs some of the exhaist through the engine again under some conditions to 
reduce pollution. If if is missing, there shold be something that is plugging
an approximately 1/2 diameter hole, and two bolt holes in the throttle body.

My bus has this, but the other end wasn't hooked to the exhaust pipe.

Subject: FI to sheet metal rod?

What does the long metal rod that connects the FI (near throttle) to the
top cooling tin on the left side do?  My bus seems to run fine without it
(
it did not have one when I got it).  Is is some kind of strutural support?
Thanks,
Brett
