Subject: Special Announcement from Volkswagen of America and Canada!

This e-mail address has been identified as belonging to a Volkswagen Club 
or Enthusiast and Volkswagen in the United States and Canada has some 
great news we would like to share with you.  

As you may have heard, Volkswagen of America, Inc. and Volkswagen Canada 
Inc. are endeavoring to break into a new arena of licensing!  In just a 
few weeks, we will announce the formation of our Trademark Internet 
Licensing Program for Volkswagen vehicle enthusiasts and clubs in the 
United States and Canada.  Visit us online at 
http://vwlicense.ipprotector_dot_com.

-An Enthusiast: Any individual desiring to promote their interest in 
Volkswagen products, the company and its heritage on a website in a NON-
COMMERCIAL manner.

-A Club:  Any NON-COMMERCIAL organization that has its primary objective 
a sharing of interests in Volkswagen products, the company and its 
heritage on a website, in newsletters, at meetings and events in a NON-
COMMERCIAL manner.

-NON-COMMERCIAL:  Having no functionality to allow for revenue to be 
generated at the site including, but not limited to, commercial links, 
advertising of any kind, and shopping carts.

Why do we need to do this?

Volkswagen of America, Inc. (&quot;VWoA&quot;) and Volkswagen Canada Inc. (&quot;VWC&quot;) 
are the exclusive US and Canadian importers of cars manufactured by 
Volkswagen AG (&quot;VWAG&quot;) and are responsible for protecting trademarks 
associated with those cars. The Volkswagen logo; &quot;VW;&quot; the 
words &quot;Volkswagen;&quot; &quot;Beetle,&quot; &quot;New Beetle,&quot; &quot;Bug,&quot; all other Volkswagen 
vehicle names; the New Beetle logo and the Volkswagen advertising slogans 
(such as &quot;Drivers wanted&quot;) are all registered trademarks or service 
marks. (This is only a partial list - we didn't want to bore you right 
off.)  None of these items may be used without the express written 
consent of VWoA or VWC in the U.S. and Canada. (What you may use in other 
places depends on the laws of that country.)  If a trademark owner fails 
to protect its rights to its trademarks, it risks losing those rights.  
Did you know that &quot;escalator&quot; was once a registered trademark?  And so 
were &quot;aspirin&quot;, &quot;trampoline&quot;, &quot;refrigerator&quot;, &quot;yo yo&quot; and many more!  But 
they failed to take precautions that would have helped them have a long 
and prosperous life as registered trademarks.  

You may want to take a look at our Trademark Enforcement Program Policy 
Statement (http://vwlicense.ipprotector_dot_com/policy.html)  and our 
Trademark Usage Guide (http://vwlicense.ipprotector_dot_com/usage.html) which 
both include more information regarding our need for this program and 
offer guidance with respect to the proper use of our trademarks.  

What will a license involve?  

Use of any VWAG, VWoA or VWC trademarks is restricted to certain types of 
use, more clearly outlined in our General Terms and Conditions 
(http://vwlicense.ipprotector_dot_com/gtc.html), and requires our written 
permission in the form of a legal agreement, the Draft Club Limited 
Trademark License Agreement (http://vwlicense.ipprotector_dot_com/club.html)  
or the Draft Enthusiast Limited Trademark License Agreement 
(http://vwlicense.ipprotector_dot_com/ent.html). (These are the U.S. 
documents, but the Canadian documents will be basically the same.) 
These legally binding documents will grant legal permission to 
enthusiasts or clubs to utilize our trademarks in a manner which does not 
infringe upon our trademarks or is not counter to our brand image. 
In order to comply with applicable trademark licensing laws, these 
License Agreements will be continuously monitored to insure their terms 
have not been violated.  

Your job.

If you think you may be interested in being a part of our licensed 
family, now is your time to preview our documents and provide your 
opinion prior to the launch of the program.  Now, although we will read 
through all the comments we may receive, you must understand that we may 
not be able to implement every suggestion.  We will, however, do our best 
to make this program as user friendly and acceptable as we can!   Just 
click here (http://vwlicense.ipprotector_dot_com/feedback.asp) to send us 
your thoughts.   

Thank you for your time and interest in our products!
