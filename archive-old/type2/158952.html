&gt; is the company I used for my last run. They are comparable to Hanes Beefy
&gt; Ts, or Fruit of the Loom. I use whichever of those 3 has the best prices
&gt; at the time. As you can see, there are many colors to choose from in short
&gt; sleeve. If  you click on the color sample, it will tell you if that color
&gt; is available for long sleeves, hoodies, etc. Again, I can print on any
&gt; color you choose, but be aware that this white &amp; silver design won't look
&gt; very good on a light colored shirt. Hope that clears things up.
