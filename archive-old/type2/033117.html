Subject: Well... just added a Vanagon to my fleet

Hi Folks,

Just wanted to share my joy with folks who would under stand...

I've been negoiating with this couple in the next town up from me here
in NH on a plain jane '84 Vanagon (only option I can see is the second
heater under the rear seat) for well over a month...  They started out
asking $1200, after a week it went down to $850, then $750... Hadn't
been able to get back with them for a couple weeks so I dropped by the
house Wednesday to see if it was still there...  Owner was there getting
ready to head north for the holiday.  When I asked for the lowest price
he would consider, he stated $600.  When I told him that the reason I
hadn't bought the Van earlier was that the best offer I had gotten on my
'85 S-10 Blazer 4x4 was $300 (had to sell something to buy this Van), he
said &quot;I'll give you more than that&quot;...  He ended up agreeing today to
the Blazer and $200 cash...

So it comes here tomorrow...  &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;!!!

Now...  I made a trip over to VT this morning to get a seat/bunk for a
buddy's '73 Deluxe from John's Car Care...  While there I spotted an '88
GL with the weekender seating in light brown (Van is Samos Beige over
Assuan Brown) being parted out...  Ended up buying the two rear seats
and the rear engine cover cushion for $150...  Now all I need is the
roof/pop-top clip to achieve my long time wish for a Vanagon that could
seat 7 and sleep four...

    Thanks for listening...
