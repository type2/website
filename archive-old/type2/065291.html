Subject: Re: Can I repair '81 Vanagon heat exchanger?

The proper term for this is probably &quot;flare&quot;.  Check with muffler 
shops.  I faced the same problem and did something completely 
different (changed the entire non-CA system to a CA system).  When I 
get the non-CA system running I was planning on getting the straight 
piece with the flare on it replaced (on the non-CA this is welded 
onto the catalytic converter) and re-welded to the cat.  A GOOD 
muffler shop should be able to create this part for you.  If you have 
problems finding a GOOD muffler shop, talk to local VW shops, or get 
in touch with people who do dune buggies (custom muffler work).

This joint IS a problem, 'cause most people (PO's, shops, &amp; owners 
included) don't take the time to orient the muffler properly to get a 
good fit at this joint.  This joint MUST have the pipes parallel to 
each other or a small leak will eat through somewhere.  I had to bend 
flat (hammer) the joint on the muffler cylinder to allow it to 
rotate into the proper position.  

&gt;  Anyway, is there any straight-forward of repairing this?  Can I
&gt;  simply
&gt;  cut off the &quot;bevel&quot; or &quot;bell&quot; (3/8ths of an inch or so) and come up
&gt;  with some other way of attaching the muffler to the pipe?  Or, if I
&gt;  cut this bit off, could a muffler shop put a new &quot;bell&quot; (what is the
&gt;  term for this?) on the remaining pipe?
