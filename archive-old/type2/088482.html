Subject: Re: [T2] Pulling Plug Wires

Been posted before- Find a way to expose each plug wire while attached-
either a special distr  cap with dremel tool having attacked each connector
cover, or stick a wire or foil  under each spark plug connector end.  Ground
each connector with another wire -alligator clips on it are useful- and hold
it with insulated pliers.
&gt; I've read a lot of posts that say to remove the plug wires one at a time
&gt; while the engine is running to see if any one wire makes a difference in
the
&gt; idle. Where are you pulling the wire? At the plug end? The distributor cap
&gt; end? Somewhere else I'm not aware of? And what do you use to insulate
 yourself from the 'bite'?
