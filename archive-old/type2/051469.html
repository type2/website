Subject: [T2] Tow Bar

Hey Guys,

Has anyone used a VW Tow bar?  Does anyone have a picture of one or a really
good description?  Will it fit somewhere in the bus?

Has anyone bought one of the Tow Bars offered by Bus Depot?  What is the
difference between the two (one costs about $25 more)?

I would really appreciate any help.  Bess is lonely (not even oil to keep
her company) in a parking lot across town and I really want to go pick her
up.  I'm desperately trying to get her running again and build up my
confidence in time for an extended trip in June.

After much discussion, miy wife and I have decided to go ahead and throw
some more money at her and do our best to make her the most reliable little
bus we can have (We just love her and really enjoy all of the VW camp-outs
and I think she's sadistic and loves watching kids beat each other whenever
they see us).

Thanks,
