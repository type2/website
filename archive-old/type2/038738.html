Hi Adam.
The tips bag for MC replacement shows the following:  A couple days
before, clean all the threaded parts with a toothbrush to get the dirt
and grunge off them.  Start lubing all the threaded fittings with WD40,
Liquid Wrench or (preferably) Kroil. do the same with your bleeder
screws at the wheels.   test the brake light switches and if you have a
bad one, get a replacement.  Get a couple BIG bottles of brake fluid and
bleed the whole system once the new one is in.  Make sure your brakes
are adjusted and all should be well.
