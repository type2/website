Subject: transmission leaking in 73 bus...

&gt;found out that the transmission is leaking gear oil where the shift shaft

&gt;What's involved in fixing this? Does the transmission need to come out?
Does
&gt;the transmission need to be taken apart to fix it?

The transmission can stay in the car while the worn bushing
is replaced.  Remove the tranny's &quot;nose cone&quot; and get a new
bushing fit into it.  The nose cone is the front part of the tranny
that has the shift lever shaft going into it.  I think the later model
bus trannys have a bearing in there; '73 has a bushing.
