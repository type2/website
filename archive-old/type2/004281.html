Volks,
Putting 2 liter back together for my 73 bus, and am out of luck locally
trying to find a donor for fuel injection locally.........

I am looking for the whole setup...if anyone has a parts van or this stuff
for sale let me know.

I have looked at the Miller FI, but it is more or less a polished used unit
for $670..........._dot_can't justify that.

Any leads would be appreciated, for I need to acquire it within the next 2
weeks.
