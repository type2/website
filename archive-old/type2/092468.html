Subject: Re: [T2] Heat exchangers and tin

Hiya Kate,

Having problems with installing exhaust components seems to be the rule 
rather than the exception with VWs.  Here's a hint; put all the pieces 
together without tightening down on any of the nuts.  Just twist the nuts on 
the studs enough to keep a particular piece in place.  That will allow for a 
bunch of &quot;play&quot; with each piece.  You should be able to get most of the 
system in place going about it this way.  Then, when it looks as if 
everything is connected, go ahead and tighten up on the nuts.  

And way before you do any of this it would be an excellent idea to soak the 
nuts and studs with a good penetrant (PB Blaster for example) and let them 
soak.  After getting the nuts off the studs discard the old nuts, get new 
ones, and chase the threads on the studs.  Then attempt your assembly.

Your missing tin pieces are available locally at a number of places.  You 
might want to try Always V-Dub (kinda pricey but they'll be there), Pacific 
West, or German Auto.  And I'd definitely patch that hole under the battery.  
If you need help give me a call, I'm in SW PDX.

Mike
