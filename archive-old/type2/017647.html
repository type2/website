I have a 72' with dual 34pdsit carbs.  The left carb seems not to be
working.  I also have a GT sports style muffler so to two heads have
their own exhaust.  The left exhaust is cold will the right has warmth. 
The compression on both is the same just the temperature is different. 
The power loss is minimal but it is there.  What is going on?
