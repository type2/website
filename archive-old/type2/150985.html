Subject: RE: [T2] dash conditioning

There are indeed vinyl conditioners that have UV inhibitors in them.  They 
are usually marketed to folks with convertible vinyl tops.

After searching for a while, I found a uncracked dash for the bus on samba

Does anyone have something they swear by that will condition it and help
prevent, instead of premote, the cracking?


Thanks,
