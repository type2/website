Subject: Re: [T2] Bob the Tomato bounces back!!

Hi Phil,

Making up those pipes was a cinch. I took a pair of 1975-78  
manifolds, which normally point forwards and swapped them left for  
right, so that they now point backwards. I then took them to a local  
muffler shop and asked about having some small mufflers and tail- 
pipes welded to them. As it turned out, the guy at the muffler shop  
did Harleys in his spare time and had a pair of genuine HD pipes  
available cheap. He welded them onto the manifolds for a total cash  
price of $100 and I was good to go.

They are loud. I don't know if I will get roadside assistance from  
the biker crowd, but I do know that their heads swivel when they hear  
me drive by.

Anyone here know if the 75-78 manifolds will bolt up to the square  
port heads in the 79-83 engines???


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; What a great idea! What fabrication was involved with this one?
