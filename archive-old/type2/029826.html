&gt; My 71 westy has more than usual butt-sag, plus the camber seems off

&gt; sure.  If it were a swing-axle, I'd say that's why, but do IRS trannys 
&gt; also undergo camber changes with suspension flex?

Not as big, but camber does change since the inboard pivot of the trailing
arm is aft of the torsion housing.

First, be sure that adjustment is needed.  put the bus on a level surface,
put a driver in the driver's seat, and use a level on the sliding door
sill.

&gt; Anyhoo I'm contemplating the spring-plate adjustment procedure.  I've 
&gt; gone over the stuff in the Type2 library and read some posts in the 
&gt; archives going back to '96 or so.  I've read Haynes for the geometry 
&gt; info.  The procedure doesn't sound overly difficult (heh, heh, sure).

It really isn't, but do yourself a favor and bathe the bolts you will have
to undo in your favorite rust-dissolver (kroil, liquid wrench, etc) for
about a week before you tackle the job.

&gt; I'm thinking I should just pull the plate off the outer end of the 
&gt; torsion bar and crank it down one notch (and therefore raise the rear by 
&gt; one notch-worth).  Do I also need to do the inner end -- ie, will just 
&gt; one notch at the outer end be too much?

I had the same idea, and believe me when I say that one notch was _way_
too much!  Poor handling, tire wear and two destroyed CV boots were the
result.

Remember, in a correctly adjusted bus, you cannot see the horizon in the
inside rear view mirror.  I think this oddity has resulted in more
misadjusted suspensions that any other cause.
