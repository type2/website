&gt; hello volks,
&gt; i'm in scott's valley, ca and i'm having tranny
&gt; problems. i just had my automatic tranny rebuilt (all
&gt; but the throttle body) 3 weeks ago and i started
&gt; having problems 4 days ago.

what year auto tranny,  vacuum or govenor shift, not really important in
this case.
   who rebuilt the tranny, I haven't found anyone competent to rebuild an
auto tranny for much less than $1,000.

&gt; problems...
&gt; large rattling (maybe flexplate?) when stopping or
&gt; when bus is tipped forward and in gear. i originally
&gt; thought maybe i had a rock stuck back there, but
&gt; checked and i could find nothing.

get a real flat 13mm open end wrench, crawl under and with a large
screwdriver move the torque converter around and as each of the three
bolts that hold the torque con to the flexplate and tighten them down real
tightif they are loose

&gt; the flexplate, pump rod, torque converter and all
&gt; seals (inside tranny and outside) were just replaced
&gt; in arizona. the rattling started 4 days ago and now i

I can feel your pain, mine just started rattling in reverse, it could be a
number of things, have heard of em running like that for years but not
sure I would trust it very far

&gt; have a leak. the oil temp is at 180 when the drip (in

leak shouldn't be related but if it is a rear bearing maybe it has damaged
the rear seal.   is the oil temp the engine or tranny,  engine oil temp is
probably not relevant.

&gt; neutral and idling) begins. we are only a pint low, so
&gt; the leak just started, but the rattle has been in
&gt; place for 4 days.

is it getting worse, only in certain gears, at certain speeds??
&gt; 
&gt; earlier repair...new flexplate (one corner of previous
&gt; busted off.) rear main and front main seals.

the rear seal can be easily put in wrong and it will leak.  Flexplates can
break if a bolt comes loose

&gt; any suggestions? i was going to try to call the old
&gt; volks home (soquel, ca) in the morning. if anyone has
&gt; some words of wisdom or words of encouragement, i
&gt; would really appreciate them. i am currently in the
&gt; 8th month of my cross-country journey and i am far
&gt; from home (virginia.) locals or otherwise are welcome
&gt; to call...

not sure who in that area works on auto trannys... I remember when you
started the trip, I'm in Maryland...

  what I would do, and this is just my gut feeling,  I would find a
working auto tranny and stuff it in the back of the bus, make sure I had
the tools to change it, and go on with my trip, if it gets real bad or
break down I would find someone who could help me change it out...rarely
does a kaput auto tranny do any other damage,  most often it is the ATF
pump that goes out and then you can frequently nurse it along, sometimes
having to stop and let it cool down and go again it is slow going but you
can at least get off the road

Good luck
Bob

&gt; 
&gt; thanks volks!
