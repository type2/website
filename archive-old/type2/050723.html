Thanks for the correction Steve. I really botched that up. I meant to 
say the S044 to 67 as you said.

I was crowding my thoughts about interior layouts and upholstery 
materials. Sorry if anyone was mislead

&gt;
&gt;If I understand correctly the SO-44 ran from 65 to at least 72.

&gt;
&gt;The SO44 was a variation during the 64-67 SO era.  This bus has a SO44 kit
