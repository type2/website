&gt; It says there is a glass window &quot;in the center&quot; to allow one to view
&gt; the action inside the head. I can't find that window on the photo.  I
&gt; worry that it might be easy to use for a front mounted engine where
&gt; the plugs are vertical and accessible,  but hard to use for a VW
&gt; engine with horizontal plugs buried deep in a cramped engine
&gt; compartment.

I cannot imagine using one on my type1 engine without a mirror arrangement
of somr sort.

Colortune has been around for at least 25 years that I know of, and it
just doesn't seem to have caught on.  I suspect that it would be useful
with a uniform fuel and squeaky-clean fuel delivery system.
Unfortunately, this is seldom the case it the real world.  Trace amounts
of some elements, such as sodium, can greatly alter the flame color.
