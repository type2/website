if the &quot;baton&quot; does make it back up the east coast, im
taking my annual trip back to ny in july and would be
happy to bring it back west to the omaha nebraska area
or drop it off at any point in between if someone else
wanted to carry the torch for a while.   just an idea
for when this all gets organized.

&gt; &gt; I think y'all should bring it up the east coast
&gt; some, we volks here in
&gt; &gt; Delaware and Maryland will be glad to bring it

&gt; &gt; know A LOT of people that would be mad interested
&gt; in it.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, but you see, it STARTED up North on the East
&gt; coast and has already been 
&gt; through MA, RI, CT, PA, VA, MD, TN, GA, FL, and
&gt; possibly NC and SC as well.  
&gt; I'm not saying it should not go back through there
&gt; again, but I think it should 
&gt; make a trip around the country first.  That was the
&gt; idea anyway.  So lets get 
&gt; the thing into some states it hasn't been to yet.
