Just to add to what Jake said, When I had a 914 and worked at the Porsche
dealer I was told by the mechanics that they filed a bit of a knife edge on
the heat exchangers to have then &quot;cut&quot; into the copper gasket to insure a
good seal. I just took a file and filed down the inside edge a bit and it
worked great, I'd had problems with sealing prior to doing this and was
quite pleased.
