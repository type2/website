Tents, tents and more tents. I was talking about this off-list.
Everyone and their uncle is looking for a side tent, and we all want
them cheap.
 &gt;&gt;

If anyone has any questions regarding new side tents, please P-mail me.  I 
would be happy to answer questions.

The new tents have lots of added features like roof vents, curtains, heat 
reflecting roofs, insulation barriers, walls that unzip and pull out into 
awnings.  You also get lighter weight, yet stronger fabrics.  It's just like 
comparing a splittie bus with a EuroVan, changes and improvements have been 
made over the years.

Most new bus tents have frames just like the old original tents with steel 
poles.  The frames have gussets in the corners to keep them from breaking 
which is common with the old frames.  You now also have the option of 
aluminum frames, which weigh about half as much as the steel.

The new tents are lighter weight, but most still total 55 - 65 pounds 
including all stakes and packaging.

There are some new very different designs now available that resemble dome 
tents.  These tents weigh 20 to 30 pounds less and pack much smaller.  

Several firms still make the old style tents with cotton canvas sides, and 
heavy vinyl roofs, but these tents are quickly going out of favor.  None of 
the tents currently available have floors.

There is no question that the original Westy tents are really cool.  If you 
want that stock vintage appearance then you should try and find an original 
tent.
