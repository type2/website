&gt; I know it is winter and I know that I just posted a question regarding

&gt; bringing the van east this summer and even a guy who grew up in Jersey can't
&gt; bear to think of the humidity .... Any info is appreciated. Happy holidays
&gt; to all!!

sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but even if you do find a swamp cooler
it won't work where the humidity is high, it works by evaporation and that
requires a low ambient humidity, they work great in the Southwest.
