Subject: Re: Voltage Regulator?

I think Todd is right.  The warm air heating fan in my 72 only operates when
the engine is running.
I've considered using the hot wire off the fan to run the electric fuel pump
since it only operates when the engine is running, but I am unsure if there
is enough juice there to power the fan and the pump at the same time.
Another idea I have is to buy the appropriate relay from Radio Shack and
have the blue wire operate two relay's.  One for the fan and one for the
fuel pump.  Does anybody know why this would not work?

&gt; My thought is
&gt; that the voltage regulator only allows enough voltage to close the
&gt; contacts when the engine is actually running and automatically
&gt; disengages when the engine is off. Any thoughts?
