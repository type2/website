Subject: Re: [T2] what are the going rates for 23 window busses

Drew,

They seem to be asking(and getting) that much for pretty much perfectly
restored ones.

One of the club members here in Arkansas has one with *original* paint,
otherwise it is *perfect* and I believe that he has it at the painters
right now.

He will sell it when he is done, but I don't think he will ask that 
much...don't know for sure.

Cheers, dave
