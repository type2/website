Subject: Re: [T2] let's overwork the resin guy

I heard....

That West coast metric had a perfect set that they got from one of
our favorite bus dismantelers and that they had finally started to build a 
mold for them.

They have been in their catalog for a long time, but just n/a.

Maybe they really will get some made!

Cheers,dave
