Here is a picture I took just for you!

Does the new marker light have the little ears that snap into the holes in 
the body?
If not you can use small bolts to attach the housing.
I had to knock out the broken inserts after the ears fell off and attached 
using 1/4-20 bolts or um 10mm bolts.
Hope this helps.
