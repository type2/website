Subject: RE: [T2] Various questions (long)

&gt; BTW , the fuel pipe that goes through the firewall should
&gt; have a rubber
&gt; grommet around it. If it is missing, replace this pipe. Many
&gt; a VW bus has
&gt; burned to the ground because the vibrations have sawed

Ah, you just made me think of another question.  I have no firewall,
behind the fan shroud I see a fuel tank.  Any idea what other year's
firewalls will fit?  Sources?

Thanks,

Rob
