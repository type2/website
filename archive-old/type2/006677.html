Subject: Looking for: Bob Hoover CDROM
Date: Mon, 30 Oct 2000 12:26:12 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I am told that Bob Hoover's CDROM is no longer available for sale (by
BusDepot).
Would anyone have a used copy of it available for sale?  I've liked the
&quot;sermons&quot; I have picked up of him over the net, and would like to read more
of his thoughts on VW maintenance.
Thanks,
  --RObert
