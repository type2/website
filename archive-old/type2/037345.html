Subject: Source for Mexico Beige paint in rattle cans

Hey there Volks,

My 79 westys has a couple of minor dents and scratches that I'd like
to take care of.

Does anyone know of a source for Mexico Beige (LE1M) in rattle cans
?? Does anyone know of another non-vw paint code that comes close to
matching this color. I think some old volvos's were painted a
similiar color.

Thanks in advance,
