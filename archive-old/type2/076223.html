Mike,

They do not without major work.  The '68-?73? column is completely
different from the '?76?-79 column.  The change occurred somewhere
between, I am not sure where, but I have had a '73 and a '76 and they are
very diferent.  If you want to know just how much of a bear adapting a
late column to an early bus is, ask Don Boneau.  I *think* he has the
column from a late bay all set up and functioning in his early truck by
now...  Don?  :-)
