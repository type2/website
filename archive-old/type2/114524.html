Subject: Re: [T2] hesitation or surge

&gt;I kept getting this sudden temporary loss of power. It must only last 
&gt;about a second as it feels like ive let off of the gas pedal, and 
&gt;then pressed back down to resume speed suddenly. maybe the fuel pump 
&gt;is going out, and every so often im not getting any gas, so the motor 
&gt;has no power, then right back to normal again? It kinda makes the bus 

I've had a similar problem on my 73 (with 2.0 motor and D-jet FI) for a
while now.  I've gone through the whole FI system and replaced any suspect
parts, and verified all electrical connections, but the problem still
exists.  The only thing I've got left to check is the distributor.  

I've got a nagging suspicion that the grounding wire on the advance plate in
the distributor is loose.  Anybody know if this would cause a &quot;sudden,
temporary loss of power&quot;?  

As the original poster of this thread mentioned, it feels for all the world
like the engine just quits for a split second and then resumes like nothing
had happened.
