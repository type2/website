Subject: Re: Propane tank restore/paint

Bill,

FWIW on the '81 tank I washed it out inside many times with hot water
and TSP as an amazing amount of sluge/gunk had built up.  As I was
worried about how thin the tank was under the build tag and I was feeling
anal, used a 1/4&quot; NPT fitting in the 80% tap and hydroproofed the thing to
160psi with air over water plugging the other outlets of course, then metal
etched and conversion coated the inside with standard PPG chemicals.

Followed by a full sandblasting of the exterior, PPG DP40  epoxy primer, and
some left over white PPG catalyzed acryllic enamel (from the '90.)  Looks
great, should never ever rust again.  I also ground off and fully removed the
manufacturer tag (considerable rust underneath as always) then after
painting reatached the ID tag (also blasted, primed, painted both sides)
with 3M trim and emblem tape.  On the gaurd I masked off the Manchester
labels carefully when blasting and painting.  Reasembled valves etc. using
quality Loctite pipe thread sealent.

Waxed the whole thing, looks real nice, may not have been worth the effort
as Bus Depot had em I think in the $250ish range.
