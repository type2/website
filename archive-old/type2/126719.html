Subject: faucet

I bought a faucet from busboys for a mid 80 style westy. They sent me one 
which is black and has 2 wires leading out. I am putting together an interior out 
of a mid 80s bus into a 72. I have the wiring figured out to the pump but 
this faucet has a T and a C marked on top. What does this mean. I figured out 
that when the faucet is turned to T only the water inlet on that side on the 
bottom is open if, turned to C then both open. Yes it has 2 water lines on the 
bottom, why is this. Please help. Thanks Dylan
