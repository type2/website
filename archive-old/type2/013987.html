Heh.

see the archives...http://www.type2_dot_com/archive.html

take your pick of the three, you'll probably get thousands of hits.
Generally, Ron had a good operation.  He's had growing pains sometimes,
and just like anyone else sometimes a bad product will slip past...but it
happens with any vendor, so its nbd.

He's been on these lists longer then I have (and in fact started the
business because of the demand shown here) and has always been helpful.

My few cents.


......david (mm. yeah. I've ordered lots from him.)
