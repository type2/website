Hey all,

A buddy (non-listee) asked me to post this for him as he is desperate for $
so he can be a good Santa for his kids.  Maybe he can be Santa for you on a
really good deal.  I can confirm this is a good running engine.

CB T4 Long Block.  The original seller said its a 2000cc but the case
numbers suggest a '73-'74 1700cc.  Engine runs strong with good compression
numbers. $200-$300 range.  My buddy, Steve, got the engine in a trade for
some work (he is an autobody man) and was going to put it together with a
later model Westy that he had bought, but the deal fell through.

Seller:  Steve Combs, Ponca City, OK, (580) 762-3638
