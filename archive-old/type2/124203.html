Subject: Re: [T2] clutch problems

I had a guru tell me that a flywheel can be worn out. They need to be
reground and there is a critical dimension, the distance between where the
pressure plate bolts on and the friction surface. If really worn and/or
burnt, this dimension opens up and there will be insufficient spring
pressure on the clutch disk, causing short life and the burnout you already
experienced.  I don't know the specs- Maybe someone on the list does. I
believe the flywheel has to be reground on 2 surfaces, maintaining this
specification.
Also, as someone else mentioned today, you may need a new pilot bearing in
the end of your crankshaft.
Have a good look at the clutch fork assembly and throwout bearing and clips
when you get in there. Look for cracks etc.

&lt;Yes.... we checked... it was the right one..... and same part
number....checked it all... Yes..... we are dropping the engine right now..
just got it up on the jacks...... Thanks for the help
gail

&gt; When you put the clutch disk in, did you carefully check to make sure you
had the right one? There are various sizes for different years, did you hold
the 2 disks together and compare?  You may end up needing to drop your
engine again, it looks like. If you've backed the clutch cable all the way
off, then it's time to have a look inside. Sorry. Tom
