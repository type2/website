So, I have to look for a Thing locking cap.  hmm.. 
Good to know.  Hate the
thought of drilling a hole in my gas door to install
a lock.  Anybody with a
picture of a neat installation they have done?  Am
NOT going to have more
gravel in my tank this year!!!

Good luck, I have had friends get new Thing caps to
