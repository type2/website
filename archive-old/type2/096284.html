Subject: RE: [T2] Buying a bus for the first time...

&gt; Thanks much for the info, everyone on this list has been SOOO helpful!  

well   I bought my first bus (60 deluxe microbus) sight unseen about 6 AM
on a Sat morning...saw the ad and woke the owner up.

don't remember how I got my second bus (65 Westy)

the next one a 71 I bought New from the dealer...then I got married and my
wife did not like the bus so got her a 74 412 wagen (still a VW) but then
strayed from the fold (but stayed German with Audi and
Mercedes)unfortunately some years ago my wife lost a battle with cancer
and shortly there after I started &quot;Looking&quot; for a bus.  took over a year
even posting advertisments for &quot;exactly what I wanted&quot; 
   a guy called having seen one of my ads, he had just started stripping a
bus for parts but if I wanted to look at it, I did and bought it partially
disassembled, although the seller was willing to put it back together for
me.  a week later I picked up my current bus and now 9 years and over 100k
later I'm still happy with that decision.   

so what does that say?? you can get a good bus just about anywhere but the
basic rule (forget who said it) expect to spend $5000 for a good
bus. either up front or in parts and repairs.   I think that is a good
rule of thumb.

&gt; I'm very much in the same position as Meredith (climbing on board...)- just
&gt; had a kid, find that my car is too small, want a larger daily driver that

well mine is a daily driver, all mine have been, but I carry stuff all the
time so it isn't so much hauling kids (I have 6, all but one now grown) as
hauling &quot;junque&quot; 

&gt; isn't a freaking SUV.  Certainly not afraid to get my hands dirty (can't be

good cuz it comes with the territory

&gt; fact I've been looking in my area for a class on rebuilding engines and

better might be to get a couple decent books on VWs' and a basic set of
tools.  not that the classes are no good but most are based on
&quot;modern&quot; water cooled vehicles and while the basics stay the same most of
the techniques are different.

&gt; basic mechanics (no luck so far).  I'm in PA, very close to the NJ border
&gt; (Newtown/Yardley area)... anyone got some time to look at a transporter in
&gt; trade for some beer, pizza, web development?

always open to pizza, I'm just a bit South of you in Baltimore City. but
we have a pretty fair number of buses rattling around town here so I will
keep an eye open for you. there is a guy named Desmond that has a VW
repair shop but he frequently has some buses for sale 410-665-8787.
  he is a pretty decent carb engine mechanic and will not cheat you BUT
he is not cheap and he can drive a real hard bargain. YMMV
  (if it is automatic or Fuel injected he is not as competent and you
could get a bargain because he doesn't like working on em)

  good luck in your search
