If your rear floor vent was open at the time, you would have watercooled
exhaust for a little while, and probably get a nice steam bath through
the vents. Sauna on wheels anyone?

&gt; Burst a water bed inside a bus and two things would probably happen...

&gt; The engine would probably flood and die causing very rapid 
&gt; deceleration coupled with a decided list in the direction the water 
&gt; decided to take... Altogether, as Laurie Anderson once said, &quot;I'd 
&gt; rather see this on TV...&quot;

No. I think youd have about 2 feet of water in the cargo area or in a
walkthrough about 18 inches in the cargo and cab area. And it would be
leaking out as fast as it could find a path.
