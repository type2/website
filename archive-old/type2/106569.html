Subject: [T2] Pass Smog Forever 

&gt;Arkansas requires neither smog nor safety
inspections. All you California
people have to do is re-register your vehicles in
Arkansas . . . . Renewing your registration can
be done via the mail. 

The good doctor has a point.  Several other
states are good also, such as Ohio.  No
inspection, no personal property tax, and no smog
in most places--exceptions Cincy, Cleveland,
maybe others?  Most southern states do not
require smog testing or safety checks. 

The quick and dirty address solution is a box at
mailboxes etc. or some similar venue, with the
mail being forwarded to your home address.  This
will cost you $40 or so per month.  Is it worth
it?  Also, understand that most states have laws
requiring that you register your vehicle in the
state in which you live.  If you live around a
college town or a snowbird town, you probably
won't get hassled. But in many other places, the
cops look for this sort of thing.    

A better idea is to find some relative who lives
in a favorable state and title the vehicle in
their name or yours, that is &quot;Johnny Busowner or
Aunt Betty.&quot;  (If you register in two names the
designation of OR or AND is important.  If you
put AND, you will need that person, or a power of
attorney to act in their absence, for any
transactions related to the vehicle.  If you put
OR, either person could act as the owner.)  Then
you register the vehicle in the favorable states,
in this case Aunty Betty's state.  Gotta be
somebody you trust, because Autn Betty could sell
the vehicle or put a lien on it without your
permission.  

It's fairly easy for the police to prove YOU live
in Kalifornia instead of Arkansas and that your
bus shouldn't be registered in Arkansas.  It's
much harder for them to prove that you
fraudulently titled and registered your vehicle
in a co-owner's name to defeat registration and
emissions laws.  

This co-owner trick also works to defeat sales
tax in some states.  Buyer gives money to seller.
 Seller and Buyer titles the bus in his name OR
seller (after getting the cash of course), that
is &quot;Johnny Busseller or Joe Buyer.&quot;  A few
days/weeks later, Seller goes back to DMV and
removes Buyer's name from the title.  The danger
is that Seller also has the right to remove the
Buyer and could do so.  Again, gotta be somebody
you trust.  Usually, adding a co-owner to a
vehicle is not a transaction that triggers sales
tax.  

Caveat:  I seem to remember that some cities have
smog check requirements concerning vehicles of
people who reside OR work in an area.  If that is
the case where you live, having the vehicle
registered in your name or Aunty Betty's name
will not protect you.  Your back to just dodging
the cops.  

Of course, you could just move the hell out of
the People's Socialist Republik of Kalifornia. 
No smog checks and not many vehicle larcenies in
Arkansas, right doc?
