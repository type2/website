G'day All!

&gt; There's now 7 Australians on this list.

Make that 8!!!!
Just joined in last week.
(Hmm...maybe I *am* the 7th??)

I am in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.

Got myself an orange '74 bus and a brown '85 Caravelle. (What do you guys 
in the US call that??)

&gt; Welcome to the new Aussie. You are now a member of a very exclusive 
&gt; group. There's only been 6 of us for a while.
&gt; 
Darren.
