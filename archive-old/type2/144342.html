&gt; The shift coupling, at the nose of the transaxle, is a

AMEN!  a couple weeks agom Barry posted about a problem with shifting and
this was one of the first things I checked (and what turned out to be his
problem).  This is a pressed-metal joint that is under too much strain.  a
couple of spot-welds make a world of difference!

The only problem is finding the correct orientation before welding.  Match
it with a new one, then put the new one under the rear seat for emergency
use :-)

&gt; The archives are your friend..... use them.

AMEN!
