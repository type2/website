There seems to have been a company that did conversions like this. I have
seen at least two in junkyards and one very nice one in a parking lot.
They cut a squarish hole in the roof, attached some fairly flimsy wood
framing inside the hole, and finished the work with vinyl-covered
hardboard panels. Not the crudest conversions, but not elegant by any
means. 

Of course, it could be an owner conversion.
