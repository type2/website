Subject: Altenator Problems

Hello Fellow Listees,
OK, I know this is a Vanogon question, but I don't belong to the Vanogon
list, because I don't have a vanogon, I own a 73 Westy. However my
father has borrowed by brother-in-laws 85 vanogon, and the
battery/altenator light has come on. It goes off temporarily while
driving/idleing up, but comes back on when stopped. Any suggestions on
what to check or do would be great. Thanks for being wherever you are.
Mike 73 Westy
