so far so good, no leaks noted, tranny seems to work, but the gas guage is
still not working right, put in a brand new out of the box sender while
the engine was out.   with half a tank it only reads 1/4 is there any kind
of calibration that can be done???

&gt; Another side note on the auto tranny seal, I wonder if Bob is talking about
&gt; the 003519089D seal which is a T3 part also used in the Vanagons, so maybe

&gt;from memory I think that is the number, I know it is the same seal as used
on the Vanagons.

&gt; also in the bus box.  Funny thing there is that the last one I bought was
&gt; damaged, new in the Elring (said German) box.  Pretty good chunk of the
&gt; inner surface missing, and unquestionably factory sealed packaging.  So pays
&gt; to inspect all your parts extremely carefully, quality control isn't what it
&gt; used to be.

that was the reason for the panic, when I inspected the &quot;new&quot; replacement
there were a number of splits in the rubber near the &quot;top corner&quot;
