Subject: She runs!!...but a question

hey volks,
well put the finishing touches on lizzy's engine this
afternoonand fired her up.   started pretty easy and
let it run at a steady rpm for a while to get things
going.   when it came time for a quick trip around the
block, she felt a little sluggish.   she is running
fine, not smoking or backfiring, just sluggish
feeling.   i am going to give it a tuneup tomorrow as
my plugs, and wires are in need of replacement and it
might be just that.   valves are adjusted, timing is
on, etc.   is there anything else i am missing folks. 
 if youve forgotten, i had the motor out to replace
pistons/ sleeves, AVP heads.   as a side note, went
downtown last night (old market in omaha) and saw 4
busses!!!   the most ive seen at one time in the state
of nebraska in 2 years, 2 westy's, a campmobile and a
sweet Devon camper.   cool night, wish i had mine.
have a good night.
