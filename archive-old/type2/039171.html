Subject: Trailer Hitch for 70 Westy

 Hello everyone!

 The Westy will be comming back from the body shop soon, and Ill be hitting
 the trails for some much needed camping time.  I was planning on getting
 a small trailer to tow behind the bus so I dont have to stuff everything
 with me inside.  Anyone know where I could snag a strong hitch for a 70
 Westfalia?  While Im at it, I could use a rear bumper that isnt totally 
 destroyed.  If anyone has a line on a strait bumper for a 70 Westy Im 
 restoring, I would really appreciate it.

 Thanks again!

 Derrick

 70 Westy, getting pretty!
 72 Standard, getting rusty. :I
