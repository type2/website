&gt; &gt;Another difference, dual oil pressure relief valves.
&gt; &gt;I do know that hydraulic lifter cases only have the one main 
&gt; &gt;relief valve and a plug where the second one would be and of course no 
&gt; &gt;drilling for its return into the sump.
&gt; 
&gt; This is the first I'd heard of this. I believe all the type 4's are dual
&gt; relief cases, I've never seen a plugged control valve hole. 

I sure hope you're wrong about this!  I'm rebuilding 2 Vanagon engines 
and I looked and looked and never found that second pressure relief valve!
