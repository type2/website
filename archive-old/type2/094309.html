Subject: Re: [T2] Some painting thoughts

Janice Bartmess sends:

&gt; Can anyone recommend a highly durable paint that is worth putting on a VW
&gt; bus? Something that might be like the original in color and durability? Jan
&gt; B

Glasurit 22 or Sikkens Autocryl (or the PPG, Sherwin-Williams or DuPont
single-stage equivalent) if you want car paint, tractor paint or industrial
paint if you want cheap. (How much is road striping paint? The kind with the
little glass beads in it? With the insane drivers we have in Fayetteville,
this may be useful.)
