Thanks for all the responses to my request, and yes that was a 46mm hub nut 
(not 36mm) that I still haven't removed.  I still haven't fixed this, but 
unless I'm missing something here (likely), the two 11 mm smaller bolts on 
the drum face don't give me access to the brakes, unless I wasn;t swinging a 
heavy enough mallet at it to free it up. What they're for I'm not sure yet.  
Anyone able to enlighten the newbie here?  I'll check out some of the other 
theories though the cable appears to be moving freely and I think I won;t 
know till I have a looksee at the brakes.  TIA.

&gt; &gt; drum from the shoe wear.  You only need the 36mm nut removed to work on
&gt;the
&gt; &gt; bearings (I know because I made the same assumption once)
&gt; &gt; Just thought I'd save you the trouble.

&gt;And on a late Bus it's 46mm, not 36mm.  36mm is for the Type 1 cars.
