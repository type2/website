Subject: Re: [T2] How cold is it, Johnny??

I got 2 4 amp 12v electric blankets from a place like 12VoltProducts_dot_com
, on sale for $29.......I made a seat cover out of it-it gives you a
warm back and butt to sit on, but wish it had more wattage; the 120 volt
lap blanket I used in an inverter worked better (about 80 watts on low),
but this is more efficient and I can have one for a passenger.   The
Black Cat works well for rear passengers, but it does have a
recognizable smell.  If you have a loose Westy top, make sure the seal
fits and run a gutter clamp strap over the poptop.
&gt; 
&gt; So, I got great air flow, notorious engine heat, air tight Westy, driving
&gt; gloves, lap blanket (an airline blanket now), stock insulation at the
&gt; firewall front panel, a Bra (Really keeps the cold off the front as I am
&gt; driving) and still I get cold.
