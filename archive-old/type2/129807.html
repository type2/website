&gt;The hose was aroiund the 2 inch mark

I measured it to be 2 1/4&quot;.

&gt;The supplier (with whom I have no connection etc) was VW Heritage in the UK,
&gt;cost was a fairly steep UKP40, but I was tired of fiddling with the old one.
&gt;I have just checked an online converter and thats about  CDN95 or USD73,
&gt;plus shipping.

This hose is available from NAPA:
