Subject: rough idle

Recently, my '79 FI bus has had a rough idle. I have gone
back to 93 octane and that has helped a lot. My dwell is
set at 50. My timing was at about 5BTDC and I have reset
that to 7.5BTDC. One thing I noticed when the rough idle
started several weeks ago was that my tach jumps +200 rpm.
Whether at idle or at speed, it is not stable and jumps
around +200-300 rpm.  I also notice when I reset my timing,
occassionally my timing light would not fire.  I feel there
is some sort of ignition problem here, but not sure what.
Bad condensor? Coil?
