. It appears that the dizzy drive is off by a few
&gt;degrees, as the rotor wasn't lining up exactly with the notch on the dizzy
&gt;for #1. We checked for TDC when the crank pulley notch is lined up, that was
&gt;correct

If the rotor is off by a few degrees, the distributor drive gear may need to be rotated
one tooth in the other direction.
