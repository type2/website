Sorry for the repeat - I forgot the subject on the last post.

I had a recent addition to my VW family, but the PO lost he title he had
&gt;from that a PPO had signed over (and of course he doesn't remember the name
or address of that PPO).   I know there are companies out there that will
help people get valid titles.  Has anyone used or can recommend one of these
companies?
