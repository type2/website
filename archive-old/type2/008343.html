I've been working with a friend on a paint job . .

Baja Style, fiberglass front, fenders and a scoop across
the back, above the engine.

So we had a '70 body, stripped but still on the pan.
He had removed the padded dash and welded in some of the 
holes so we were also doing an internal paint job . .

All the glass and upholstery gone, to be replaced by new
sexy stuff . .  this  is his hunting car . . what the hell
is he hunting . .?  :-)

This thing even had a bracket planned in to mount rifles,
another for the GPS compass . .

He wanted a paint like Imron . . he'd been impressed in
the past . .

We got to impressing each other on the body work and spent
two weeks massaging every bump and flaw from this pig . .
It got way ridicuulous toward the end . .

So we start with the PPG &quot;seal coat&quot; . . &quot;DP Epoxy Primer&quot;
 This is the coat that seals all the paint and bare metal
from the world . . . this body is about 1/2 paint and 1/2
bare metal . . and about 1/2 fiberglass . . :-)

For all intents and purposes, this stuff goes over anything.
From memory, a quart of primer was $27 and the catalyst $17.

Comes in colors DP40(grey green), DP48(white) DP50(grey)
74 (red oxide), 90 (black) . . .

We had a quart of this and the DP402 fast catalyst . .
We had no problems with this stuff . . I disapprove of 
&quot;fast&quot; anything in my paint but we were working in low 
temps and it ain't my problem anyway . . mix: 1:1

The quart was enough to do the whole bug once and maybe
another half car . . we used it when we ground out some 
areas later that needed bondo . .

You do not sand this coat at all, if you break the skin
for some reason(like the big low spot we found on the roof)
you should apply another coat of the same to seal the area
again . .

This stuff above has a pot-life of 72 hours drys in less than
an hour though . .

Having blown that on, we hummed around step 2 the high-build
Primer Surfacer . .  PPG K36  and a K201 catalyst . . .

This stuff alone will cover almost anything and sands like a 
dream . .  it's a greyish white out of the can but is tintable
if you need that . .

We had a gallon . . could have got by with half of that . .
I think that was $88/gal and the catalyst around the same . .

Bud had a reciept for $207 just for these primers and the 
catalysts and the reducer(thinner) you have to use with it . .

This K36, you mix 5 parts primer, 1 part catalyst and 1 part
reducer . . in this case we had a medium reducer . . mo'bettah.

Pot life of this stuff is 2 hours . . we wasted a good quart by 
mixing too much this first batch . .

Later, I got to thinking . . we took some and put it in the 
freezer . . it will not kick off overnite . . I have reason to
believe it would be &quot;good&quot; for quite some time . . had I thought
of it soon enough we could have saved that quart of primer we
lost . . . I have an aquaintance that saves epoxy for weeks
this way . . .

Sanding seems appropriate about here . . we used 80 grit at first,
cutting down bondo etc. . . . then went to 220 and finally 400 grit.

In addition, I picked up some abrasive sponges at the local . .
these were a medium grit . . made for doing furniture etc.
I would guess them at about a 300 grit . . they worked best in the
corners or radiuses . . 

While this K36 primer is a good sand and has good adhesion,
we still have to live with &quot;build-up&quot; in the abrasive . .

Finer than the 220 grit, you might as well go to wet sanding.
Easiest way to keep the abrasive clean . . I see no point to 
finer than 220 on a primer coat . .

Bud doesn't like to &quot;guide-coat&quot;, don't like to use a block 
either . .

He does alright for an ignorant white boy but he wastes a 
lot of time.

We had four of those 3X5&quot; rubber blocks and two long blocks,
about 17&quot; long . . for no reason I can think of, we used no 
power tools . .

Bud uses his hands for finding the flaws . . just goes around
feeling the thing up . . :-)

The trouble with just hands is the time thing for one and you 
can find this low spot that way but you can't define it . .

A light &quot;guide coat&quot; with some cheap lacquer in a spray can . .
Two or three strokes with a block and suddenly your low area 
is all that has any &quot;guide-coat&quot; color left in it . . 
Now you have it defined and can fill or whatever . .

Both sides above the doors on the roof . . almost guarantee
you have a low spot there . . someone set something up there
that was too heavy . . in buds case, he lays his rifle across
there for a rest . .

We sanded this pig down to the seal coat and reprimed three times
before we were satisfied . . 

So then bud goes back to the PPG place  to get some Imron or 
whatever. He'd decided on a urethane top coat . .

He comes back a couple hours later all ticked off etc . .
They have some kid in there that seems to only know what he
can't make  . . has no clue as to what he can make . .

Rumor has it the PPG in the next town is &quot;boyed&quot; by another idiot
so bud went to the Dupont place in Medford, the next town . .

So he comes back with some &quot;Nason&quot; &quot;Ful-thane&quot; which he is 
assured is as good as the Imron . . not only that he says the
guy even knew what colors he could make . . we're back on track . .

He had the guy make up some red but he wanted some orange in it
for brightness . . by the time the pair got done we have an 
orange with some red in it . . :-) &quot;no matter dude, the cops will
still be able to find you&quot; . . 

Looks like a giant tangerine . . orange peel and all . . :-)

In passing, he took the spec sheets on what we had already put on
the beast and the guy said &quot;no sweat&quot; you could put anything on
over those two primers . . the spec sheets have a long list of
what you can use over or under them . .

So now we have the paint . . spent another week dicking around
with the primer . . that damn fiberglass kept showing pin-holes.

Since we have both inside and outside to do and want to keep 
over-spray down, we masked off and shot the inside and door-jams
first . . left that overnite and then put the window masks 
inside and shot the outside . . pull that masking tape as soon as
you're done . . never leave it til tomorrow . .

We had painted the inside the day before and have some less than 
24 hours on that paint . . I taped those masks to the fresh paint. .
When we were done a few hours later I peeled it off  . . no problem . 

They had a sale on this &quot;Nason&quot; urethane paint . .
A gallon of urethane: $62      pot life 4 hours . .
Catalyst: 1 pint, $21
Reducer, fast: $12       hateful . . :-)

They threw in all the stir sticks and strainers . .

A paint pail and some tack cloths and he came out for under $100.
The paint pail was marked with fluid values ie. pints 
One item I'll use next time will be small paper cups I can use to 
measure &quot;parts&quot; and then trash . . 3 rolls paper towels

The whole thing could have been done, primers included for less
than $300 . . as it was with the wasted primer, $350 . .

Bud is not a painter . . he complained about the gun so bad,
I went out and bought a new gun . . in his hands it's still
just a rattle can . . . it's painful to watch . . 

A few words about guns . . I bought an HVLP (hi volume low pressure)
with a 2 quart pressure pot . . awkward bitch . . you need about 
1-1/2 quarts for a coat on a bug . . maybe 2 for a bus . .

Had a 5 hp 20 gal single stage compressor it was adequate . .

Water in the air . . have a seperator there at the compressor,
then get some of those disposable water filters that go right at
the gun . . it took us three for just the top coat . . didn't worry
about the primer . . I was using about 15 psi and the compressor 
could just keep up . .

Good points of the gun . . it has the nozzle out on the end of two
hoses, the pot hangs at your belt . . you can run the gun upside 
down if you  want . . the pot is still right side down . . 
the weight is always the same . .


Definitely need a bud who can hold a light for you  . . .

In spite of buds deformities . . it came out pretty good . .

The paint really looks and acts tough, we had some coupons
and such to play with . .

That fast reducer almost undid us, should have had a slower 
reducer . . temp was in the 50-60F. 
What I mean is that the paint would barely flow  . .

Bud still managed 4 runs and some 15% has orange peel . .

Bud insists on hanging all parts while painting . . as in on
the car . . we had all the doors and fenders and hood etc.
bolted on loosely . . don't do that . . 

On the doors . . around the hinges . . you can't get paint 
in there . . fenders you can't paint the bolt flanges .

By the same token, the paint on the doors for example is as
thick as I would want it . . this paint went on well . .
Three solid heavy coats . .  there was still some paint left.
I could have gotten 4 coats easy . . .

The best description I can think of for the paint would be that it
resembles powder-coat only shiny . .it feels hard but is actually
rubbery from the coupons we played with . .

As far as the flaws . . the runs will be cut down with a 
plane and the areas that have orange-peel will be wet-sanded
with some really fine grit paper . . 1200 ? ? what they call
&quot;color-sanding&quot; . . .

Can't wait to get that toad out in the woods and wrestle a 
few trees . . . :-)

He's already talking about fixing his old one up to keep 
taking to the woods and just have this one to sit in . . :-)

I'd be remiss if I didn't say a few word about the fumes . .
Nasty is about right . . as for what's in them, every carcinogen
your mother ever warned you about . . get some ventilation and
a mask  . . . don't bitch to the EPA either, they'll stop selling 
to us . . 

I'll add a story that is told me by a body man across the way,
the cheap paint job is achieved thusly: take that DP epoxy primer
and just fog coat everything  . . this is what makes the paint stick
good say he . . now just paint over it with your top-coat . .
Any body work was done before you primed at all . .

I have criticized my friend with zeal in this post . . it is meant
to show that even with these flaws in application the paint job
was a success . . in real life he's a fair dinkum mate . . he just
can't paint . . :-)
