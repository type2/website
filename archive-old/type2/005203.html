Subject: Re: [T2] 79 rebuild/colorado

ALL The rebuilds that I have seen from Norway, Holland, or the entire are of
the Netherlands have been less  than worth theri investment...

Like i have said before, if you want a good engine, contact us, or Boston
Bob, all the other produced engines we have seen have come far from meeting
our expectations..

I have some used engines in running condition, price is 500.00 plus
shipping..

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Hi folks!
&gt; &gt; I need to replace a 79 westy engine with shot main bearings, and serious
&gt; &gt; oil
&gt; &gt; leaks.  I was curious if anyone had one available in good shape or knew
&gt; &gt; of a good
&gt; &gt; place to get one around Fort Collins/Boulder CO area.  I've been running
&gt; &gt; a weber
&gt; &gt; progressive and would like to avoid fuel injection.  At this point I am
&gt; &gt; considering replacing the whole engine rather than risking a rebuild on
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; current one, and any advice regarding this would be greatly
&gt; &gt; appreciated.  Has
&gt; &gt; anyone had experience with the holland rebuilt engines which my mechanic
&gt; &gt; suggested
&gt; &gt; I purchase?
&gt; &gt; Let me know what you've got, and feel free to reply to me so as not to
&gt; &gt; bother the
&gt; &gt; other list members.
&gt; &gt; Thanks much, and happy driving to all,
&gt; &gt; mark
