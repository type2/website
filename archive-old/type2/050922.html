Subject: Re: [T2] 68-73 Westies

&gt; 		What year did they start installing the rear shelf above the
&gt; bed? I have seen a 69 and a 70 without it, my 71 has it, so 71?

Optional through 73, I think.

I've seen 68's with nets and 68's with shelves...seen 73's with nets and
with shelves.

&gt; 		The side cabinet at the front is held in by latches up to
&gt; 70? The 69 has the latches and my 71 has screws as well as the 72 and 73 I
&gt; have looked at.

My 69 had screws.
