Subject: Eberspacher Gas Heaters

Hi:

I have jsut had my Eberspacher BA-6 gas heater fixed by Sean at Shamrock 
Racing, Albuquerque, New Mexico. This heater, standard on my 79 Westy, had 
basically never been fired and quite a few mechanics had tried to make it 
work, to no avail, until someone on the list recommended Sean. Well, I have 
got heat in my Camper and it's a great feeling!!!!!!!!!

The gas pump had to be replaced and all wiring and relays had to be checked, 
but they have no secrets for Sean. I personally believe he is a National 
Resource, besides being a super nice guy.

Here is the address, he is not listed:

Sean Baker
303 San Pablo NE
Albuquerque, New Mexico
87108
(505) 256-1666



I would have never found this guy without the list.

Thanks.

Frank
