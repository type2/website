&gt; just my experience you might want to change them...
&gt; i dont know how bad they are but i do know that they can get bad enough where you will blow more oil than you can keep in it..
&gt; 
&gt; there again like i say i dont know how bad yours are leaking either...

that's the key, how badly do they leak and how many leak

&gt; 20 miles up the road isnt that bad but ther again depends onthe seals condition...
&gt; 
&gt; nasty mess also..
&gt; 
&gt; i know someone once that put 12 quarts of oil in the bus from leaking seals for a 45 minute ride home.. stopping every few minutes to add oil..

I once drove almost 200 miles with one bad seal, only needed about a qt of
oil the whole time (thank goodness considering it was synthetic) but did
get lots of looks and did get pulled over by the police in New York State
he was satislfied after I explained the problem and didn't even give me a
warning by you may not be so lucky...

it's amazing how much smoke one quart of oil can produce

as alwways YMMV
