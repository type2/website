&gt;Anyway, I'm going to be drilling a couple of holes in my van
&gt;in order to facilitate the intake/exhaust pipes for the Propex
&gt;heater I bought.  I need some advice, though, on how I should
&gt;prep/paint the holes so I can keep the rust demon at bay.
&gt;
&gt;Any help is much appreciated. 
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
