&gt;&gt;&gt; Incorrect.  Seat rails changed in '76.  I know this from

&gt;&gt;BS, I have a '73 1/2 or a '74 front seat in a '76, the seat is the
&gt;&gt;early non headrest type with the big circle handle tilt back 

&gt;I should clarify that the change, from what I've seen, was late in 
&gt;'76 (perhaps for the '77 model year) - but I know for sure that 
&gt;there was a change.  My '78 parts van's seats would not fit my 
&gt;friend's '71.

OK,

I'll don the old suit and throw in my bit, this is how I remember it (based on
experiences that are about 3 years old now I guess).......ignitors ready! 

 I think you're both sorta right.  'Low-back' breadloaf buckets (pre 72?) will
go into the rails in a 72-76 body which came with the 'headrest' seat (at
least in Aus).  However, they are not a 'perfect' fit - their tracks are
slightly *narrower* than those on the 'headrest' seat.  But they will go in
(often feeling 'OK') and if they flop around too much a little judicous
hammering on the rails, flattening the 'notched' section allows the seat
locking mechanism to work OK and 'tightens' the slop in the fit.  

Now the post 76 body rails are a little wider again but I think  the 72-76
headrest buckets will go in (applying the same method as described above)
...BUT the 'low-back' buckets (pre 72) will not go into the post 76 rails -
they are just too wide for these seats.......

*sigh* as clear as mud eh?
