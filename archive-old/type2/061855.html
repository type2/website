Volks,

I p-mailed Ulf in response to his question on block heaters.  I said I
have seen these dipstick block heaters here, and indeed I have, but not in
a while. Problem is, right now it's 25F here and that's considered very
cold :-)  Sometimes it gets all the way down to *0F*! but very rarely.  As
a result, locally, block heaters are just not a priority.  But... When I
was up in South Dakota, I saw a rack of them and considered buying one. 
They look (in the packageing) like a long dipstick (~ 1 meter) with a plug
on the outer end.  I imagine they work like an immersion heater, thread it
into your sump and attach an extension cord.

Questions are: is anyone more familiar than I with these beasts?  Do they
work?  Where could Ulf get one by mail/web order?

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
