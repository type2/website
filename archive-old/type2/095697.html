&gt;There is a resistor in series with the solenoid that has been known &gt;to increase in value over time. You should measure less than 60 &gt;ohms from pin 86b to pin 65. (I know you tried a second double &gt;relay measure it too).

Do you mean 86b to 85?

&gt;Your meter may be reading the average voltage of the chopped &gt;waveform supplied from the relay to the pump (6V if its a square &gt;wave). You would read low depending on the duty cycle of the relay &gt;chopping.  The voltage would be low with the pump hooked up or &gt;disconnected and could have little to do with the resistance of the &gt;relay to pump wire.

I understand. I've now hotwired the pump to a house lightswitch in the cabin to bypass the relay. Bus still won't start.

Can anyone address the swinging double relay issue? This thing clicks like crazy when key is in #2. Replaced relay and afm. Must be a wiring issue but what? No good test procedures known.
