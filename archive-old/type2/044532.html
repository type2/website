Subject: Re: [T2] JC whitney heat shield insulation

If you haven't read G. Matthew Bulley's Heat, Rust, and Noise website I
would go check it out NOW!  It's got a great description of how and
where to use that insulation.

I'm starting now on the full project and Bulley has put together a very
detailed and thorough description of how to do the retrofit with reasons
for practically everything.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I want to insulate the headliner area in my bus, and have found this
&gt; material from JC whitney, its grey padding with an aluminum sheet on one
&gt; side.
&gt; 
&gt; I want to glue it to the roof with the silver side toward the roof and the
&gt; grey side down(facing passenger area), i think this will be best but want
&gt; some input, here is my rationale:
&gt; 
&gt; - silver side toward the roof reflects heat back up
&gt; - silver stuff wont hold water so it will keep any moisture in the padding
&gt; away from my steel
&gt; - grey side down will look better until i can get a headliner put in...
&gt; (though a &quot;mirrored' celing _could_ be entertaining... for about 10
&gt; minutes)
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone agree/disagree or have any input at all?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; Steve
