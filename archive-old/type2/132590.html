Subject: Re: [T2] Simple canvas patching solution?

&gt;&gt; The best answer to this question depends on whether you are willing

&gt; Nope.

The best way to repair a long tear like this is to get a piece of 
fabric of similar color and weight. Cut a piece about 3&quot; wide and 6&quot; 
longer than the tear.

Throw a loose, broad zig-zag stitch across the entire tear. You'll be 
taking this stitch out eventually, so it doesn't matter what it looks 
like. Its only purpose is to pull the pieces together.

Apply contact cement to the inside of the poptop canvas and to all of 
the repair strip, according to instruction. With a helper, apply the 
patch to the inside. With the helper inside holding a flat surface -- a 
board -- against the repair, go to the outside and use pressure from 
the back of a big spoon or similar to get a good bond.

To finish, take the stitch out and replace it with a zig-zag hand 
stitch across the tear. Same color thread as the canvas. Throw another 
fairly tight zig-zag hand stitch around the perimeter of the patch, 
sewing through canvas and patch on either side of the edge.

This repair will outlast the rest of the canvas, and will look 
competent.
