That's the key.

&gt;If you read the label carefully you will find that the product does not 
&gt;react with bare metal, only with rust. If you apply POR to paint it 
&gt;just coats the surface, and when it cures it loses its ability to 
&gt;convert rust.

It still creates a non-porous seal though.

&gt;In other words, POR applied to bare metal offers no better protection 
&gt;than a comparable paint. At a MUCH higher price.

I have to wonder about that because the paint in the body cavities still allowed the rust to fester. The painter put in the POR15 to permanently seal it up and prevent future rusting. Hopefully I won't be able to report how long it lasted...

&gt;POR does create a good coating, but its price point makes more sense 
&gt;for rust treatment than as a sealant for bare metal.  Equivalent or 
&gt;superior sealant products have to be available for less than 
&gt;$200/gallon.

A gallon coats 350 sq. ft. and costs $95/gal but I get your point although automotive paint isn't cheap either and why use a cheapo paint in the dark places only.

I'm not a painter or a marketer but their FAQ is worth reading:

And let's not get Restomotive Labs confused with the Eastwood Co.
