&gt; &gt; to remove the tank, I've done it with the engine installed. It just

&gt; Does this mean that, from your experience, it is possible to replace
&gt; the sender simply by tipping the tank out -- and not removing it
&gt; completely? You could, for instance, leave the fuel lines connected?

you can swap the senders on a FI bus without removeing anything or cutting
any holes in the bus.  helps to have small hands but I've done it a couple
times.  I found lying on the rear deck with head thru access hatch works
about as good as any other way
