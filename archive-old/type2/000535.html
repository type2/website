so instead of buying a new one I am saying to hell with the entire
+AD4-mechanical fuel pump world and going to buy an eletric one, what type
should
+AD4-I buy, how do I set them up, do I need some special pressure regulator,

Hi Shawn

Why have you decided that the fuel pump is not working? I went through this
with intermittent cutting out, and bought a new pump, but when i checked the
old one it seemed be OK. Anyway I then went and got an electric pump from a
scrap yard. You need a different sort depending on whether its carbs or FI.
I can't tell you about FI but I believe they run at a higher pressure. The
carb type pump hums constantly and I presume stops pumping when the needle
valve on the carb shuts.

My cutting out was improved but not cured, as I had a piece of paper in the
tank which kept getting sucked up to the outlet. No amount of tank draining
would help this until I got the tank out, but I tried everything else first.
