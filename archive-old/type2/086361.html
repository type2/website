Subject: RE: [T2] Steering wheel interchangeability

Paul,

The splines are different. However the shafts are just a little longer and
bolt to the coupler the same. I once was going to put together a kit to swap
to the newer style, far superior wheel. So little time so much to do. If you
can get the later wheel and shaft I think that you can make it happen.

Hi Folks,
    Does anyone know for sure if a steering wheel from a '77 bus will fit a
'71 bus?
