Subject: Need an Austin Crash Pad...Trade splittie stuff!

Sorry for public bandwidth waste, but sh*t happens as they say!

  My wife will be attending the Austin Film Fest/conference next week
and while we booked flight/lodging over a month ago we just found
out the lodging part of the package is no longer available.

  The quick rub is we're now in desperate need of a hole to hole up
in while she's there.  She's solo'ing this trip as I'm too caught up in
bizness to bail out with her.  Cheap accomadations are available as
I've made a few calls, but a unescorted lady (who doesn't drive) leaves
our downtown hotel options looking rather seady.

  Any friendly volkfolks on the list who might consider a trade off for a
weeks lodging (just a place to toss a suitcase, meals not required).
Would be happy to offer same iff'n-when anyone would like to take a
vacation to sunny (yeah, right) Florida... 

OBVWC
Or, I have splittie goodies to barter with!
