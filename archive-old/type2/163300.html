I hope so too.  My experience however is that if a CV Joint is poorly made
(ie: some &quot;Trandform&quot; garbage of a few years ago), I would think after
35,000+ miles something would have indicated a problem by now.  Recent
inspection, cleaning and repacking (every 30,000 or so is the norm for me)
didn't indicate any glaring problems.  I'll let ya know again after a
cross-crountry trip I'm taking in the next few weeks from California to
Tennessee and back, about 5 to 6,000 miles worth in one shot.

&gt; &gt; Get with it folks, more and more

&gt; True, but there is also an outpouring of poorly made products.  Seems that
&gt; there needs to be a non-Chinese company hovering over the quality control
&gt; to make sure that the Chinese factory maintains standards.
&gt; Even if a &quot;name&quot; manufacturer is buying product from a Chinese company it
&gt; doesn't mean that the company is maintaining quality on other products.

True as well.  Brazil and Mexico were the same way for VW, Bosch &amp; Hella.
Early on (and even into today) there was a difference between OE Product and
Aftermarket Product.  But that's where the efforts of guys like myself,
VWG/Airhead, Bus Depot and other &quot;quality minded&quot; people in the biz come
into play.  We're constantly on the go searching, testing and evaluating
product everyday to ensure that a viable quality item will be offered to the
end-consumer.  And just like Brazil &amp; Mexico before, we're finding that
there is a vast difference and in quality regarding products being supplied
to the OE auto manufacturer(s) and the Aftermarket made products, the
latter  of which are are poorly made for the most part.  Scott Dempster
(VWG/Airhead Owner) goes to China several times a year in the efforts of
maintaining quality control of the manufacturers we deal with.  We're quite
confident that in the case of the CV Joints VWG/Airhead offers that they're
not dealing with a &quot;GEX&quot; type of company, at least as far as I can tell.
Nothing's perfect of course, but quality control is an on-going thing and
it's a job that's never done.

As far as the company offering Asian CV's and/or Boots on Ebarf, I have no
idea where they've sourced their product and upon checking their history
with VWG, they've never purchased from them.  Caveat Emptor.
