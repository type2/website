Then we should start calling all solenoids relays, or all relays 
solenioids, I suppose? Look, you started off the last post by saying 
that the WR 1 &quot;masks&quot; another problem. And you're right about that. But 
don't mix terms. When people use the word &quot;solenoid&quot; they mean that 
thing on the starter. And when they say &quot;relay&quot; they mean a device that 
keeps high amperage from passing through switches on the dashboard (and 
other electrical tasks). Don't mix these up to make a point.

Many people on this list drive buses in sub-optimal condition. I'd much 
rather they toss in a WR-1 and spend their money on replacing fuel line 
or maintaining breaks than to worry about all the faults that could 
cause hard starting -- including a suboptimal solenoid -- first.
