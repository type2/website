Subject: Re: engine dolly mailing advice

Anyone who wants a copy of the dolly plans just needs to send me their
postal mailing address, and I'll get them out, though maybe not for a week.
My daughter's high school open house is next weekend, and it's about all
we're sparing time for right now.  Clean garage and all that.

No need to send me a SASE, I figure this is my payment for all the good help
I've gotten, not to mention a free engine hatch.

I've got a couple of addresses in already.  No need to send me one (this is
the the list) if you've already done so.

&gt;&gt; I drew up the design I used for my engine dolly last year, then offered
it
&gt;&gt; on the list to anyone interested.  I have a 1600 DP, but the plans could
&gt;be
&gt;&gt; easily modified for most any of the aircooled engines.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Looks like I'm accumulating another list of mail-ees.  If anyone is
&gt;&gt; interested, I'll mail them a paper copy of the plan (it's on a single
&gt;piece
&gt;&gt; of 11 x 17 paper, done on cadd and easily read).  Also makes a good stool
&gt;&gt; once the engine is back in.

&gt;&gt; &gt;John,
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;What this about an engine dolly?  Is it for type I engines or any air
&gt;&gt; cooled?
&gt;&gt; &gt;Info would be appreciated!
&gt;&gt; &gt;
