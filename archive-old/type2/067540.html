Subject: 23 window project for sale

Came across a 63 23 window today...another unfinished project.  Basically
the guy picked up the body about 4 years ago and has been collecting bits
ever since.  He has most of the glass apart from 2 roof skylights,
windshields and rear window.  he has seats, instruments, engine, jailbars,
clock etc.  But is a real put it back together job, probably still be a few
little bits to collect .....

The body has been sand blasted, etched and primered ready to paint (?). Has
rust in floors, front valance, battery tray, rear wheel wells cut..........
windows are  clean.  Front beam has been butchered at some stage  in an
'attempted' lowering job, he has a rebuilt one and new bushes etc (which
need to be pressed in).....

He also has a Rootes supercharger for a Type 1 motor (what  engine(s)  this
thing would actually go on I have no idea).  He's asking 2 grand for the
lot.  I think $3-400 would take the supercharger and $1500 would take the
bus and bits (without  the supercharger).  Probably a better, less rusty
more compete and cheaper deal than a 23 recently advertised in Arizona (eh
van Bondo?....)

The bus is in a panel shop in Newark and the owner is in Hayward (Bay area).
I have the guy's name and number if anyone is interested...
