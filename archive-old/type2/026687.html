----------------------------------------------------------------
I've owned 4 type IIs and have never had to replace a CV joint, yet.  
But it seems to me that fully packing the boot would put drag on the joint
and stress on the boot as it turns.  The grease would be continuously
squeezed and have to slosh around in a circle as the angled axle bar
rotated.  It's not like a ball joint or traditional car front suspension
joint boot that is supposed to be packed full.  These only wiggle a little
back and forth as the road surface changes.  When I do it, I'll pack the
joint and some extra around it, but not the whole boot.
