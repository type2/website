Subject: seized transmission?

Hi Folks,
I'm getting to work on a 74 with a supposedly just rebuilt engine from a
78.  When I got the bus I couldn't turn the engine manually and assumed it
was seized.  I pulled it, found I could turn it by rotating the flywheel and
put it back in.  It won't turn again.  It rolls fine in neutral but the
engine won't budge a bit.
The PO had reported that the old (also recently rebuilt engine) had seized
so he bought this one about a year before he sold it to me but never got it
running.
Does this sound like a seized transmission?
If so what parts typically fail on a manual?
I'll probably embark on the rebuild myself if it turns out to be bad though
I'm assuming it's going to be a big project.
Thanks!
Steve in S. Jersey
