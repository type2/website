Subject: RE: Shifter Vibe

Tom and All;

I fought a similar problem with my &quot;quality custom rebuilt&quot; transaxle (1970 
Campmobile) for a couple of years.

The rebuilder insisted that the noise source was something other than the 
gearbox, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.  The noise and 
vibration, particularly in 2nd and 4th gears, continued to worsen to the point 
that driving over 50 MPH in 4th became impossible.  The shifter was shaking so 
severely that it seemed about to explode up out of the floor.

Last summer, in connection with an engine pull and rebuild, I returned the 
transaxle to the rebuilder for disassembly, inspection, and repair, supposedly 
under his warranty.  He insisted that he could not find any problem or defect, 
re-assembled the transaxle, and returned it for re-installation in my camper 
(my warranty claim was refused, on the grounds that nothing was wrong with the 
gearbox).

While the transaxle was out of the bus the entire shifting mechanism was 
removed from the vehicle, inspected meticulously, and found to be in perfect 
condition (including all the bushings, boots, etc.).

After the transaxle was re-installed it was instantly obvious that something 
had been changed -- the shaking, vibrating, and racket were gone.  To this day 
the rebuilder insists he made no changes in the transaxle during his 
inspection and re-assembly.  All evidence and independent professional before 
and after consultations contradict the rebuilder's contention.
-------------------------------------------------------

Last January I suddenly lost all drive in the transaxle.  The clutch engaged 
and disengaged normally, all gears shifted normally and could be heard 
spinning with the clutch engaged, but there was no drive to the half-shafts.  
My diagnosis, corroborated by independent professional consultations, was that 
there'd been a failure in the final drive.

The transaxle rebuilder was adamant that the transaxle was intact, and that 
any failure had to be in a spun hub/drum spline, etc.  This despite having 
been informed that there was NO drive at the output flanges on either side of 
the gearbox with the clutch and gears engaged and the engine running.

When the rebuilder finally disassembled the transaxle the final drive pinion 
was found lying in the bottom of the housing.  It had sheared off the shaft at 
the base of the gear. 

I have the broken pinion shaft/gear.  Close examination reveals that it had 
been cracked nearly in two for a long time.  The faces of the crack worked 
against themselves for so long that they are smooth and polished from the 
friction.  All that was holding together was an area (in cross section) about 
the size of a fingernail.  That area's appearance is totally different from 
the rest of the break, being coarse, crystallized, and granular because when 
it broke the pieces separated and there was no more surface to surface 
friction.

I contend that the pinion shaft was already broken when the transaxle was 
&quot;inspected&quot; last summer.  The rebuilder firmly disagrees.  Either way one is 
left with more questions than answers.  
---------------------------------------------------------

We'll probably never know what happened/changed last summer to stop the 
shifter from shaking, vibrating, and growling loudly.

FWIW...

&gt;&gt; I have a vibe in my shifter that occurs at highway speeds that is quite 
bothersome. &lt;&lt;
