Hello,

Sounds pretty ambitious to me.  I take it that you have the special
socket required to remove and retorque the pinion bearing nut?  And
a jig to set the shift fork throw?  Those two specialty tools would
be the most important in my book.  

The 1st generation 091s that came in your '77 had a 4.57 ring and 
pinion so to alter the final drive you're best bet is to change 3rd 
and/or 4th.  Stock ratio for 4th should be a .85 ratio.  You could go
for a .77 aftermarket gear and probably be OK with the stock ratio
3rd.  Anything beyond the .77 and I'd really think hard about changing
third to keep the 'throw' a bit more even.  

Good luck with this project!
