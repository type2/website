Subject: Hypoid gear oil

I went to a bunch of places trying to find GL-4 spec oil for my tranny. 
  Even a search in the dealer catalogs at the various counters came up 
short.  GL-4 is apparently out of production.  I wound up getting GL-5, 
MT-1.  Didn't I read someone's post on here saying that was an 
equivalent?

I dumped the old stuff out.  It was pretty dark.  What I thought was 
chunder was actually bubbles.  It did have that glisten-y look of fine 
metal particulates.  I looked in the bottom of the pan and found a few 
tiny chunks.   Neither plug had a magnet on it.

I thought I had done this before, when I got this tranny, but maybe I 
just topped it off.  That's what I get for not taking notes.

I drained out 6 pints and put in almost 6.5.  The tranny's final drive 
had been whining - I hope this quiets it down.

The Bentley manual sez that replacing gear oil is required only in the 
68 &amp; 68 trannys.  I guess they didn't figure on cars lasting more than 
30 years/300,000 miles.
