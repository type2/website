&gt; So now, problem,  I need to get this puppy mobile in 48 hours. The bus runs,
&gt; this I know, but it isn't a fan of idling, could this be attributed to the
&gt; choke? It will stay lit as long as you keep the rpm's higher than an idle,
&gt; but if you let off, it dies.

if you just need to move it, then a good squirt of WD-40 might do the job,
but not when the engine is running that stuff is really flamable.

or just nurse it to where you have to go, if it is not far shouldn't have
any major problems assuming the choke is your only problem...

then fixx it the right way.

Bob

&gt; So in summary:
&gt; 1) how does one quickly fix a sticky choke?
&gt; 2) does a stick choke affect your idle?
&gt; 3) what is correct protocol for adjusting your idle speed? (I don't have a
&gt; tach installed)
