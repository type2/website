Subject:      soggy vws/65 steering lock

I drove the bug (69) today, and got fed up with the sogginess. (yes, I know
this is a bus list, but this has relevance)  It is the depth of winter, which
means, here in the pacific NW, rain rain rain.  It is raining as I type.
 When they say an 80% chance of rain here, that mean it'll rain 80% of the
day.   Well, the point is, I brough this rust free bug here  almost 2 years
ago (just passed 20,000 since then yesterday), and had since replaced the
winsheild and rear window seals.  I bought the quarter window seals last
spring, whereupon it dried up.
Today it was time to do something about it

Take heed, ye with chromed strips on your side windows which rubbers you will
replace.

I took a screwdriver, my curved knife, and a razor blade.   I pushed the
 short chrome locking strip down, to free one edge of the long chrome trim.
 Then i carefully pulled the trim off the window rubber.   I made a cut with
the curved knife straight in towards the car, in the slit the chrome had been
in, all around the window.  I them took the razor blade and cut parallel to
the glass, between the glass and rubber.  Just a shallow cut, to free that
strip of rubber.  With that out, I rolled down the front window, closed the
door, and reached inside to push the glass out.   With tempered glass, you
dont have to worry about breaking it.   You can (I have, accidentally) drop a
manifold from ten feet onto it, without a chip or crack to the glass. The
glass came free at the front, and I pulled it out.  I then peeled off the
remaining seal, and wiped the window ledge clean.  It had, unfortunately,
leaked in there, as I had assumed.   Happily, it seemed *rust free*.  Not
even a bubble in the paint.   Hooray.

More later on installation

BTW, I made my initial attempt at removing the steering lock from the 65
camper for overhaul and keying.   I pried off the horn button and unscrewed
the horn wire.  i tucked it in the steering column in a way it could easily
be pried out later.  I put the 15/16 &quot;    1/2&quot; drive socket on the steering
wheel nut, and loosened it.  I unscrewed it till the top was just flush with
the top of the steering column, and gave it some good whacks wit the big
hammer.      This did not break the whhel loose.  I didn't want to use the
torch, as it would melt the horn wire.   I doused it with liquid wrench and
will try again later.
