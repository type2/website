&lt;&lt; I bought it knowing that it was only firing on three cylinders with the
 hopes of it being something simple.  I have checked for spark and everything 
is fine.
  Would the valves be the next logical step? &gt;&gt;

If the motor is still in the bus, etc. carefully set the valves per the 
books, then warm it up for 10 minutes, then shut it off and run a compression 
test ($40 tool) to find/verify the bad cylinder. Use an oil can ($5 tool) to 
squirt a drop or two of oil into the bad cylinder and retake the compression 
on that hole to see if the compression increases the 2nd time. Check Muir 
book along the way. Idea is to find out as much as possible (which cylinder, 
rings or valves or both) before tear down. Come back to the list and post the 
results of your compression test for further advice. Meanwhile gather tools &amp; 
money for possibly new piston rings or valves, or more expensively, heads and 
piston kits.
