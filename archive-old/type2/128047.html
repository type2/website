Subject: Re:fuel sender access

--- It's not a stock dremel blade.. I got it at
Boeing surplus.. I have since seen similar cutting
disks at home despot for a drill motor.. Again
you could use a jigsaw with a short abrasive blade
too.
&gt; You state on the page &quot;I used a small radial cutter
&gt; blade and a Dremel
&gt; tool.&quot;  I have a Dremel, but don't recognize the
&gt; bit, the &quot;small radial
&gt; cutter blade&quot;.  Which tool is it?

~~~~~wow.. nice job but pretty involved...
&gt; This doesn't lower the plate like
&gt;http://www.specialpatrolgroup.co_dot_uk/spooky/access/access.html,
&gt; but it seems to be an easier installation.
