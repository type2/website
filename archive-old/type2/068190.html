&gt;&gt; You know how a woodstove works? You put wood into it, fire it up, and it

&gt;Friday I was driving downtown (Eugene) and saw an unusual sight, right 
&gt;after this thread began.
&gt;
&gt;There's a yellow/tan camper, with a fiberglass high-top. Just above the 
&gt;side doors, there was a large smoke stack sticking out (sideways).
&gt;
&gt;Soooo.... he's either fitted that thing with a wood stove, or a 
&gt;Allison/Detroit 12 cylinder diesel.  Sounds like he's fixed his heating 
&gt;problems, one way or the other.

 No doubt something he picked up from Bob's Sermon on the subject.
