Subject: What color is top of dash?

&gt;What I used was a piece of indoor/outdoor carpet - not the loopy kind, but
the &quot;pile&quot; kind - with cutouts for the defroster vents.  No glare, and stuff
doesn't slip and slide.

Each time I get a new junker, SO goes to AutoZone and buys a ready-made dash 
mat of appropriate (I guess) color. Costs about $35. In most cases..about 
20% of the price of my vehicles :(. I like Susanes' idea better. Custom made 
ones are a nice fit, however, and velcro attachment is quick to install.
