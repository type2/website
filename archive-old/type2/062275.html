Subject: RMMW replacement pannels

        I bought a bay-window pickup battery tray from Bus Boys,
and didn't like the fit, bought one from Mill Supply, WAY cheaper, was 
the same part. Called RMMW and had them measure theirs, same part.
        Bus Boys sweetly let me exhange their realisticly priced part
for credit (Very nice of them) and I used the cheap Mill Supply part. 
        Conclusion: All three vendors were selling the same part, 
made in Europe. 

        Mill Supply talk a good game like they make everything themselves-
NOT. RMMW and Bus Boys don't make any such pretense. I suspect NONE of the 
sheet-metal retailers are actually also in the sheet-metal stamping business.
There may be exclusive arangements between retailer and actual part mfg 
from time to time.

        Happy motoring!
        Bill
