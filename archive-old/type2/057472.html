&gt;      Well, I just had to go look at a fan housing again --  
	[]  SNIP.....
&gt;      What it does look like, however, is that the left flap blocks a lot
&gt; of the air going to the oil cooler when it's fully open (down),  
	[]  BINGO! And the air that  does not get to go through the oil
cooler has to 
	go somewhere. So more air flows over the other parts of hte engine
than if
	the flap wasn't there. Take the flap out, and the oil gets
overcooled, and some
	other part of the engine gets undercooled. If it is undercooled, it
will overheat.
	And I bet the part the gets too hot is one that doesn't get any
benifit from the cooler oil?

	Note: I don't have any FlowTherm results of this, but having looked
at lots of airflow 
	plots, I can usually make a reasonable guess without them.
