Subject: [T2] Looking for seat cover

I'll give this one another go:

I am looking for an original seat cover (passenger side single front seat, I
guess identical to driver's side) in two-tone brown/light beige basket weave
('69 de luxe bus). I don't need the seat itself (would be hard to ship) but
I would really appeciate if someone could help me with a cover. Of course I
will pay any reasonable price (plus shipping) for it.

Regards,

Jan W Brier.
The Netherlands.
