Subject: Anyone wants to drive a Vanagon Camper from Washington DC to Los Angeles?
Content-Disposition: inline

I have a 1984 Vanagon Westfalia that needs to get to Los Angeles in the
next ten days or so.  Anyone interested in driving this cross country and
making a vacation of it?  The van is 4 speed and has AC.  You will have to
pay for the gas and your transportation back.  If anyone is interested let
me know soon.
