&gt;Greetings..
&gt;
&gt;Quick question..
&gt;
&gt;Should the vacuum hose that connects to the front of the vacuum advance on
&gt;the dizzy be connected to the vacuum port on the intake manifold (left) or
&gt;the vacuum port on the front of the carb (34pict 3).  The bus is a 71, 1600
&gt;dp.
&gt;
&gt;Mine was originally connected to the intake, but a mechanic (whom I don't
&gt;really trust, to be honest) told me that they always connected it to the
&gt;front of the carb...
&gt;
&gt;Perhaps it doesn't matter as both spots offer adequate vacuum for the dizzy
&gt;to operate correctly...
&gt;
&gt;Or does it?

Oh, it matters!  The port on the manifold pulls vacuum when the throttle is
closed while the port on the carb pulls vacuum when the throttle is open.
Hook up the wrong one and your bus will run like crap.  I can't advise you
which is correct because I'm not sure what the &quot;front&quot; of the canister
means to you vs. what it means to me.

If you want a totally unambiguous answer, do the following.  Disconnect the
two vacuum lines that go to the distributor canister at their sources,
start your engine and connect a timing light.  Allow the engine to idle and
note the location of the timing mark.  Now take one of the hoses that is
attached to the distributor, put the end in your mouth, and suck in while
watching the timing mark.  Does it go to the left or the right?  

If it goes to the left, that is advancing your timing - the hose is
connected to the vacuum ADVANCE portion of your distributor canister.
Connect the other end of the hose to the vacuum port on the CARBURATOR.  

If it goes to the right, that is retarding your timing - the hose is
connected to the vacuum RETARD portion of your distributor canister.
Connect the other end of the hose to the vacuum port on the MANIFOLD.

Just to make sure, suck on the end of the remaining hose that goes to the
distributor canister and watch the timing mark - it should go to the
opposite direction that the first hose made it go.  If it doesn't, there is
something wrong with your vacuum canister.  If sucking on either hose has
no effect on the timing mark, you also have a problem with your vacuum
canister.

Hope this helps,
