Subject: Tune-up success, carb still sucks...

All,

Just thought I'd say I finally got off my ass and tuned up the '69
Westy (hey, the last tune-up was only 3 months ago!!!). She runs alot
smoother. #1 &amp; #3 exhaust valves were tight as usual, but everything
went well. 

Now to my problem...my 30-3 carb (1600sp stock except for .009 and S&amp;J
single quiet exhaust) does not idle consistantly (sometimes not at
all). 

Here's the story: When we were moving to Az. from Or., the alternator
somehow came loose and spun around, grounding the hot lead against the
carburetor. In the process, the cover for the idle solenoid was
damaged. I replaced the guts, but the cover (steel) was damaged by the
ensuing arc-weld and one of the 3 screws is no longer usable.

The carb was rebuilt shortly before this disaster, but the choke never
fully dissengaged and has since been dissabled.

Now my question...since I have a brand new set of Kadrons (no flames,
please) that are only awaiting the cash for DP heads to be installed,
I want a TEMPORARY jury rig to fix my current carb problems. I suspect
I am having vacuum problems as the metal cover for the idle solenoid
has a hole in it (complements of said alternator disaster). Would
sealing the hole with some kind of silicone get me by 'till I can
install the Kadrons?    

Any other ideas?

PS-tried bumping the idle up to 900rpm from 850 (still in the
acceptable range per Bentley) and it helped *a little*, but not
much.....

Jaime
