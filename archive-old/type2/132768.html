Subject: Durham, NC '73 broke down, AIRS support would be helpful

Oh boy.

My friend Sarah just moved from Durham to NYC and I agreed to help sell her
'73 camper for her (even though I am in Atlanta and the bus is in Durham.  I
posted the for sale ad to the list last month.

A mutual friend attempted to drive it across town this morning but didn't
get very far, she says that the front wheels locked up.  She is not a bus
person but I am guessing the calipers are binding or the rubber hoses are
bad, or both.  What is a more likely scenario?  Does anybody think it would
be worth changing the front hoses in situ (side of the road)?

Who has had experience with this sort of problem, on a disk-brake bus that
has not been driven much lately?

If anyone in the Triangle area is available to help late tonight or daytime
tomorrow I would like to have a look before having it towed.  I have the
skills but I won't be able to bring my tools on the airplane tonight.  Might
be able to get some tools from a fellow bus driver.

Bus is still for sale but change the status from &quot;runs great&quot; to &quot;needs
work&quot;.

TIA,
Will Anderson
