Subject: Odometer

Howdy Folks,
    My name is Andy Cottrell and I am from Indianapolis, Indiana USA.  I
am new to this list.  I have just pulled my 76 bus out of mothballs and
am started the restoration.  One thing about it is that the odometer has
not worked since I bought the bus 9 years.  The speedomoter work fine(at
least I have never gotten a ticket) but the Odo never moves.  Does
anyone have an idea what would cause this or how to fix it?  I'd like to
get it working so that I can gauge my mileage and do things like valve
adjustments at the correct mileage instead of guesstimateing like I used
to do.

76 1700cc automatic transmission (I don't know if that makes a
difference or not because speedo and odo are amongst those mysteries to
me that I have no idea how they work)

Thanks,
Andy Cottrell


P.S.  If anyone knows of any good places to get VW parts or any
boneyards in or around Indy that have busses please let me know where
they are.  I am new to the area and bus parts seem to be very hard to
find.
