Subject: Oil Drain Plug hmmmm

With all this talk about oil, I just remembered my first oil change (I've
recently purchased this bus) and I've found something interesting - I have a
1979 Westy with, what I believe is, the original motor.  When I went to
remove the oil drain plug I found, what appeared to be, a strange thing -
instead of having a standard drain plug that you would removed  with a
open-ended or box-ended wrench, I found that the plug that had a hex hole -
i.e. it required an allen wrench to remove it.  Well, my allen wrench bent
before I could loosen the plug - I ended draining the oil through the
strainer whole.

 

Has anyone seen an oil drain plug that had an allen wrench hole in it?  Any
thoughts how to get my out so that I can put in a &quot;proper&quot; plug in so that
during future oil changes I can get it out with an opened-ended or box-ended
wrench?

 

TIA
