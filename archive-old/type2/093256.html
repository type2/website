Subject: Re: [T2] Help!...need windows parts


&gt;Rubber guide and the felt strips for starters.
&gt;
&gt;These are the parts internal to the window..I have the outside body to
&gt;window seal.
&gt;
&gt;Are these the same on vanagons?
&gt;
&gt;Please tell me I just missed them on some site!

Dave take the window and/or bus to a few local commercial home and business 
glass services (not automotive). Sounds like you need parts commonly found 
on storm doors. They will have bulk quantities of what you need and it 
should be cheap. Just take it and show it to them.

Our local glass shop was able to help me rebuild my jalousie windows with 
new rubber/vinyl parts they had on hand.
