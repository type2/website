Subject: Re: [T2] troubleshooting

Billy,

Same as before....&lt;grin&gt;

Did it just start running bad or bad from when he got it back from 
being rebuilt....how come he doesn't take it back to them?

Running bad and no idle just all of the sudden?

Won't idle, or won't run good or both?

Vacuum hose loose/leaking?  

Timing is going to be the same at idle pretty much no matter what.

Advance the dist a little to see if you can get it to idle...not too much 
though, and then start checking timing and spark and dwell....good 
sparks???

Maybe just a bad set of points? or timing waaay off cause it moved?
Spark plug wires all on good?...not rubbing and grounding out on 
something?

Do electrical first and then move on....if you can get him idling at all,
then you can pull the wires off one by one and see if something changes.

Loose rocker arms somewhere?

Cheers ,dave

&gt; Listees:
&gt; 
&gt; Busdriver Dave was located by me in downtown Visalia today with a badly running bus 
and the traffic cop breathing down his neck.
&gt; 
&gt; We limped it to my house and I need your advice troubleshooting. 
I've got all the tools/books, but I need some wisdom.
&gt; 
&gt; Facts:
&gt; 
&gt; 77 Deluxe Westy, T4 FI, appears original
&gt; Newly rebuilt engine by the local bugmonkeys for 18months/3k
&gt; Won't idle.
&gt; Distributor doesn't have a vacuum can on it.
&gt; Has an aftermarket ignition system
&gt; 
&gt; Questions:
&gt; 
&gt; What do I time it to? I have to find out the distributor's part number and go by that right?
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone got the correct dizzy for sale? Other options? 050?
&gt; 
&gt; What's the baseline idle air screw procedure? I read the Bentley adjustment, but where do you start at with an unknown bus?
&gt; 
&gt; Dave's trying to do right by this bus, he's put $5000 into it this year, and wants the knowledge to maintain it himself. I've steered him to the list, given him my old bentley and muir books. 
&gt; 
&gt; Won't you help?
&gt;
