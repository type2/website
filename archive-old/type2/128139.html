Subject: How hard to replace metal brake line from master cylinder to
  rear &quot;t&quot;?

I got a good scare last night on the way home in my 1969 Campmobile when I had to make a &quot;quick&quot; stop from 45 mph due to a cop directing traffic.  I hit the pedal a little harder than usual, it held for a second, then went right to the floor.  I was able to downshift quickly and slow down enough to get by, and luckily I was only about a mile from home, so I didn't have too much &quot;white knuckle&quot; drive time.  
 
The dripping brake fluid showed me exactly where the leak was... the metal line that runs from the master cylinder to the rear &quot;t&quot; fitting.  It's leaking right in front of the big tube in the rear, right where one of the mounts holds it to the chassis.
 
Three questions:
 
1.  How hard is it to replace this line?  It looks to be pretty well exposed, but the bends on either end look to be kind of a pain.  
2.  How long is this line?  I found the lengths of several other lines online, but not this one.  My local FLAPS carries generic brake line sections in different lengths, so I could splice several together if necessary.
3.  Thoughts on replacing all the metal lines?  I plan on doing a brake job on the bus in the near future anyhow (rubber lines, front wheel cylinders, etc.) but hadn't planned on replacing the metal lines unless I mess up the threads or the connector upon removal.
 
Thanks!
