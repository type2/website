I have a type 2, 71 Bus and I am looking for some help and advice from
people
that have had them for a while and been camping in the for a while
also.

Ok I have, looking at the van sideways. The front to your left, open the
side door,

I have clockwise from left, - Cooker with gas underneath in small
cupboard,then far side a seat with space under neath, then the table
then the bed/ double-seat, above is a small narrow overhead cupboard.
Then back to the n/s of the van is a sink un-plumbed in. With cupboard Space
underneath it.

Any Ideas on what have people done to cupboards, under the cooker,
under-seat cupboards, in the overhead locker or under the sink
to make life easier for themselves would be much appreciated.
I'm trying to learn from other peoples experience,
and then maybe put up the best suggestions on a web
site, unless someone has already done so.

Any Information on identifying the name of this layout would be appreciated
!
IE. How do I tell if its a westfalia for example.

TIA

Ian
