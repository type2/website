Subject: Barndoor bus I found
Message-ID: &lt;3759C9AA.2B95DBC4_at_mail.ripon.k12.wi_dot_us&gt;

I'm cross-posting this because there are people on both lists interested
in barndoor busses....
Today in Wisconsin I stumbled upon an old barndoor bus... not too sure
of the year but I think its a 57....it said 57 on the tag behind the
passengers seat so...
It is a real project for you restorers.....not...I repeat NOT for the
weak of heart...
It is original paint....white just like it says on the tag... and it is
a westy... I cant get the drivers side or passengers side doors open but
they are there....the radio and dash and steering column/wheel look
great so does all of the metal inside of the bus (seat supports, bed
support, etc..) but the floor is really rotten...there is a hole about
1' in diameter in the floor on the drivers side...so imagine what the
rest of the floor looks like...  The barndoors are both there....they
function properly... the body has spot rust....looks like bird
droppings...but its rust.  The drivers side rear (upper part in back)
has been dented...looks like something slid into it...but the frame is
not bent...  The rear window in the hatch is gone...but the cargo door
does work properly...the lock/latch in the engine compartment is gone
and I can't get it open..but there IS an engine in there...don't know
what shape its in though... the 2 windows (split) in the front are
fine...so is the drivers door windows... one of the passenger door
widows is gone... the 3 windows on the drivers side rear all all
cracked... the rockers are rusted to hell, so is the floor, and one
headlight is busted.  it is a hardtop westy... it needs new seats, and
probably a new bed, and I think the closet is salvageable... the tires
are still left on it.... it would of course...need to be towed and have
a new ignition put into it...a ll of the other lights are fine I
believe... still has a battery in it even... I took off a tailight to
try to get the engine compartment open...no luck... but the tail light
can still be put back on it....
like I said....not a project for the faint-hearted....
I would absolutely love to see somebody do something with this but I'm
not too sure if you can...

If you are interested I will go over to the guy and ask him if he wants
anything for it...

It is filled with rusty barbed wire and tires right now...but that of
course can be taken out...

there is a bullet hole or two in the front too...

I think this one may be too far gone...but I've seen some amazing things
done...

If you were interested in getting it..(towing of course) and you needed
to stay somewhere, I offer my place to you...
just p-mail me

I've seen Mr. Palmer (the &quot;DON'T BURN YOUR BUS!&quot; guy) pick up some
interesting vehicles....soo...

get back to me if you're interested...
