Subject: Re: Jack points?

Well Guys, my original Volksbus jack, with the turnscrew- and -maybe -it 
-goes- up -tecnology, proved so unusable [ shoe too small-sinks into Florida 
hot asphalt-and it was always sliding sideways] that I substituted a sissors 
jack from a Honda, and just place it under the jack tubes. 10 years and 
counting, and no probs. Still have the screwjack, though. Just in case.  
By the way-this list is great. Getting quite an education. Thanks. See you at 
&quot;Busses over the Bridge&quot; tomorrow.
