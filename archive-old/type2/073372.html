Nope.

&gt;Can a bug conversion kit be used?

Doubt it.  I think the bus parts are a lot larger.

&gt;Do I really want four wheel disc brakes, or should I
&gt;leave the rear brakes drum?

I don't know about you, but *I* want four wheel disc brakes!!!

Two main reasons I want them:

1.  The stock drum brakes stink.  Manual adjust, star adjusters always lock
up, cylinders leak, etc.

2.  The bus is really tail-heavy.  Even with weight transfer during
braking, the rears should be able to do lottts of work because they have a
significant amount of weight on top of them at all times.  In fact, I'll go
so far as to say that I believe that a bus could outbrake a Lexus of the
same weight (say, an SC400?) if it had the right brakes (and tires of
course).

I've often wondered how hard it would be to adapt the 914's rear discs to a
bus.  One of these days (like when I quit my job, move to Fresno and
scavenge at the Pick-N-Pulls with Karl all day) I'm going to look into that.
