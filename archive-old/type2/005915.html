My leaky tranny in my 79 auto has stopped all by itself. Very interesting. I
checked the fluid and it is right up, yet no more drips on the ground. Any
suggestions to this? I'm assuming because this van sat for a no. of months
before I bought it, the seals had stiffened up, and now they are loose and
supple again?
Thanks,
courtney
