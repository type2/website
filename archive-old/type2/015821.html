&gt;A quick question first.  Everyone I have talked to says that I do not

No.  As was discussed on this list recently, there are case fasteners
behind the flywheel (1 or two, not sure but one is enough) that must be
removed.

&gt;If the answer is yes, than I have a non-rebuildable case and i am looking
&gt;to buy a short block.

I've never seen a non-rebuildable type IV case.  See Wilson's book for
details.

&gt;Either a good used or rebuilt.

&gt;I have a 1.8L, will the heads work on a 1.7L or 2.0L.

The heads will work fine on a 2 liter.  On a 1.7 you should upgrade it to
1.8 with 93mm pistons and liners anyway, but if you don't, the heads will
be a little loose on top of the cylinders.  This might not be a problem,
but I wouldn't do it on my engine.  It's the kind of thing I would expect a
sleazy mechanic to do without telling me.
