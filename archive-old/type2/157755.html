&gt;
&gt; Yes, it should. Have you opened it

...opened it? You mean the black canister that sits on top of the vent 
opening? It doesn't look like it opens...it's all crimped and sealed.


&gt; and checked that the sponge in 
&gt; there is clean

If there is a sponge in there, it's likely completely clogged that could be my 
problem...


&gt; and the hose to your intake is unobstructed?

I replaced the dual carbs with a single weber, and if I attach the hose to the 
vent, it actually sucks oil up out the vent, so it's not connected to 
anything at the moment.


&gt; I've seen folks put clamps on the dipstick tube, but I like the idea
&gt; of it being kind of an emergency release valve. Otherwise you start
&gt; blowing seals that require a teardown to replace.

Hmmmm...yeah, I see your point.
