&gt;Well The time has come for me to put a new 1600 dp in my 71 westy and I 
&gt;was wondering if anyone ahd suggestions for a quality company to order 
&gt;from. . .

Hi Kevin,

I've purchased 2 &quot;1600 SP long blocks&quot; for my '70 Type II Panel from GEX in
the past. Both had brand new heads. I didn't tear the engines down to
inspect build quality, but I had no problems with either engine. The first
engine went over 80K miles with irregular maintenance, surviving an 80 mile
round trip daily commute through Provo Canyon in some extreme winter
conditions. I left the 20/50 Castrol in the motor the whole time, even in
sub zero temps! (Quite foolish in retrospect). I also took several cross
desert trips from Utah to California with the bus loaded to the gills in
temps exceeding 100 degrees with this engine. No special modifications were
done to keep it cool. Only stopped for gas and a bit of fun in Vegas. Never
a single problem. It died a slow happy death, giving me months of warning
before finally going kaput.

The second engine survived a weekly commute from Santa Barbara, Ca to
Newport Beach, Ca (approx 120 miles each way) during a typical LA rush
hour(s) and gave similar mileage. Again, never a problem.

I always thought that had I done regular maintenance, the engines would have
gone much more than 80K miles. Of course, your mileage may vary and others
may not have had a similar experience with GEX.

GEX shipped the first engine immediately, arriving less than a week after
order. The second I picked up in person.

Regards and good luck with your hunt for the perfect engine,
