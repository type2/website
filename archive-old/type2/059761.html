Subject: Dizzy Vacuum Hose connections

I have a stock 72 and I want to put back the stock dist.  I
have an 009 on it now.

I know  2 vacuum hoses go to it but which one goes where.

I noticed one has a vacuum at idle none else where and one
has a vacuum else where and none at idle.

One port on the dizzy points right back to the dizzy and the
other point up and away.

Which one goes to which hose?

Also do I need to worry about the vacuum cutoff?  I found
nothing about in on the archives.

Thanks
Brent
