&gt; does this mean that you think the engine lasts from 50-60,000 miles
&gt; A guy in the parking lot hre has a 70 bus that is over 300,000 miles that he
&gt; bought from new.
&gt; He said that things were better when there was a 55 mph speed limit.
&gt; THis meant that he really cruised with the traffic at 60 mph and did not
&gt; stress the engine.
&gt; 
&gt; How fast do you drive?

Ok, maybe we push it a little, but we try to keep it under 70.
The manual that came with the dark blue bus says that the maximum
speed AND crusing speed is 68 mph.
