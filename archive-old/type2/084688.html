Subject: Re: [T2] A/C Condenser fans needed

I just wanted to say a public &quot;thank you&quot; for the great response to
this post.  Several people have offered up sets of fans for the cost
of shipping and several others replied with helpful advice or tips
on where to find alternate fans.  Because of the kindness of my fellow
listmembers, I will be back in business soon - I sure appreciate it.

-David

&gt; &gt; Volks,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am in need of a couple of fans, the ones that sit on top of the large
&gt; &gt; square A/C condenser that is attached underneath many busses that were
&gt; &gt; fitted with aftermarket air.  Both of mine have died.  :(
