Subject: Brake booster question
Date: Thu, 19 Apr 2001 20:52:59 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

On my 72 Westy after I drive about 10 miles the brakes just go to the floor.
I bought a new master cylinder ( not installed yet) but when I first start
the bus I get a firm pedal and it won't pump up. Also when I push hard and
keep pressure on the brake the pedal remains firm and does not slowly sink
to the floor like a bad master cylinder. Could this be a bad booster?
