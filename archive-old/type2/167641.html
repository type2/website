&gt; Hi guys.  Like an idiot, I erased the emails with advice about valuations.  My insurance company offered $1,199 if I keep the Bopmobile.  Only $1400 if they get it!  They must not want it.  That's seems way low to me even if mine is a rust-bucket in places.   I've got to send them info on why I think it's low.  I remember the NADA site but what was the other?  I seem to remember Millennium or something like that.  And it needs paint all around.  But still, I couldn't find one in as good running shape as her for that kind of money.  Somebody tries to by it it from me just about every week.
