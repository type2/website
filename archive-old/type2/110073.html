Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Trying to bust a clasifieds scammer

YOU GUY'S GOT TO BE KIDDING ME, ONCE YOU DEPOSIT THE CHECK AND THE CHECK 
COMES BACK BAD THE BANK REMOVES THE AMOUNT OUT OF YOUR ACCOUNT BECAUSE IT WAS 
WITHDRAWN SOME WHERE ELSE AND THE CHECK WAS STOLEN, THIS SCAM HAS BEEN AROUND FOR 
A WHILE, THE OTHER WAY THEY PLAY IT IS THAT A RELATIVE HAS A LOT OF MONEY IN A 
WEST AFRICAN BANK BUT NEED A AMERICAN BANK ACCOUNT TO BE ABLE TO MOVE IT IF 
YOU LET THEM DEPOSIT A CHECK IN YOUR ACCOUNT FOR A LARGE AMOUNT THEY'LL 
COMPENSATE YOU WHIT MORE THAT THE CECK
