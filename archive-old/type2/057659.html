Todd, I'm too much of a newbie to offer definitive advice on your problem,
but the fan recently &quot;spun off&quot; my new cheap 74 camper with a 77 engine.
Merely took the assembly off in-situ, replaced the woodruff, which had been
eaten up, and the 400 subsequent miles have been uneventful. Was lucky the
key-way wasn't toast from what I've heard.....but might be worth the 20
minute check before you go pulling the engine. Good luck, Marv Krupp
