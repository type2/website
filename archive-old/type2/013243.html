Joel you still might consider getting them up here into WV,
but that aside, you can't cheap paint rims if you want em to last.
Some good tips (that are in the archives from me and others)

sandblast rims

use good epoxy primer PPG DP40/90 etc or their new NZT etching

paint the groove between the rim and hub part or whatever you
want to call it first with an acid brush, then spray first coat primer.

after first primer coat USE SEAM SEALER down in the groove
as there will be sand left in there, you will never get enough
paint in there spraying, and it looks good later.

spray another primer.

Topcoat as desired, if you like flat black the correct primer (DP90?)
will be fine for topcoat as well.

All with good autmotive paint, do a two tone for a more vintage look
if you care to do so.

spraying them on a turntable is fabulous so you don't have to move,
I sit a 1 gallon paint can on the turntable and the rim on the paint
can so you can do all the edges etc.

Do less and they'll rust in a year, or two, or whatever.  You need real
auto paint to resist chipping and scraping of tire mounting/dismounting
and road spray.
