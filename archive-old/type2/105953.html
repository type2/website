Subject: Last Minute EB03 Jitters

Hello All,
Loaded and ready. 1600 DP.  Pulling a 750 pound load.  10 mile trip to work
this morning, oil pressure dropped from 40 to roughly 30.  Temps about 220.
At idle the oil pressure lights aluminates.  Checked oil level, good.  30
wt, ambient Ohio temperature about 60* plus.
I have a long trip (575 miles) ahead of me.
What should I be concerned about?  Why would my oil pressure be dropping?
