Subject: gearbox replacement/engine dies
Content-Disposition: inline

Fellow list members,

I recently undertook the major task of replacing the gearbox on my camper -
a 1973 model with a 1600cc gearbox but a 'Type 4' 2 litre engine. This
involved swapping the bellhousing to the type 4 style, to accommodate the
228mm clutch (which I took the opportunity to replace at the same time).

It took 5 days, mainly because I was working solo, also because I was
taking my time and I took the chance to do other stuff, like clean up the
case, tinware, etc. I reckon I could get the box out and back, in 1½ days.

I now have 2 problems, however:

1. I can't select reverse gear. I've adjusted the gear selector (2 bolts on
the cab floor) as per the Haynes manual, no matter how I try I can get 1st,
2nd, 3rd, 4th but no reverse! Any ideas folks?

2. I initially had a lot of problems starting the engine, because I flooded
it. I got mistaken and went off on a tangent an one stage and replaced the
rotor arm (£18! Ouch!), also I removed the distributor and fitted it the
wrong way so the ignition leads are now 'reversed' (180° from where they
should be on the distributor cap). I got it started in the end, after
clearing the flooding. But it only ran for 15 minutes or so, then it sort
of 'chuffed' and died, almost as if something was blocking the exhaust.
That's what it sounded like, anyway. It still turns over on the starter at
the regular speed, in fact it can sort-of run, in that it will pick up at
about 700 rpm for a few seconds, then dies again. I've had the carburettors
on and off but adjusted no settings at all. I can see fuel in the fuel
filter so it's not what I first thought, fuel starvation due to a possible
air-lock in the pump.

So, does anybody have any ideas? I'd really like to get it going for the
weekend, cos it's Vanfest in the UK. I don't mind doing the trip without
reverse (should be interesting!!!!). Help!
