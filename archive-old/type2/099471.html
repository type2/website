Subject: Re: [T2] Buses in Knoxville area??

&gt;Any good Junkyards or places with Buses to see in the Gatlinburg/Knoxville TN
&gt;area.  We're going to Gatlinburg for a few days.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone from there?:  Leaves a pretty color yet?

They weren't last weekend. Traffic was TERRIBLE!!!! We went for a wedding 
in Pigeon Forge.

We did not go up into the park so I don't know if the leaves are changing 
at the higher altitudes.

I would recommend entering through Townsend, Wears Valley, and then Pigeon 
Forge, and then finally to Gatlinburg via the by-pass. Lots of directions 
changing but not an hour of traffic each way like we did last weekend. Your 
clutch leg will be happier for it.

I don't know of any junkyards up there but that doesn't mean that they 
aren't there somewhere.

Beware of tourist prices.
