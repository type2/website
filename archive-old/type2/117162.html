Subject: Re: [T2] Question about normal running oil temperature

what is a good place to measure it on the t4 engine?

that's a horrible place to mount it, because oil dead ends there instead of
flowing past. I'm not saying it's not useful, but it will read 20F lower
then actual oil temps.

At 230-235F it's time to cool it off with an aux cooler, and/or slow down.
(and check for missing tin or seals).
