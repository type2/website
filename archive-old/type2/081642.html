Subject: Re: [T2] alternative air filter setup.

Have you figured out how your EEC purge valve is going to work? It is in the
front half of the air cleaner housing.

The only persons coming out ahead on this deal are the people that sell it to
you and K &amp; N.......  There is nothing wrong with the function of the factory
design.

&gt; I have been considering replacing the air filter box on my fuel injected
&gt; type4 with a more modern &quot;performance&quot; air filter style. The kind you see
&gt; on those K&amp;N intake kits.
&gt;
&gt; My idea is to fabricate an adapter to connect it directly to the air flow
&gt; meter. the adapter would mount to either the side or top of the engine
&gt; compartment. Its basic purpose is to convert the square port on the AFM to
&gt; the round port on most of these style air filters. I've even considered
&gt; going as far as fabricating a pipe that goes from the throttle body to
&gt; the AFM,replacing that ugly boot that tends to leak air in.
&gt;
&gt; The reason for this is to make more room in the engine compartment and
&gt; make things a bit more accessible in there.  It would also compliment a
&gt; detailed engine compartment nicely ;)
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone think of why this would be a bad idea. I know these L-Jetronic
&gt; systems can be fussy when you alter the way they work (even if very
&gt; slightly).
