Subject: Re: [T2] rebuild 2.0l

Not sure which Hondas have hydraulic lifters. I've had four - '84 CR-X, '84 
Accord 12 valve, '87 Accord Hatch 12 valve, and currently '99 CR-V 16 
valve. All have no lifters at all. Rocker arms ride directly on cam and 
include an adjustment screw. Never adjusted the CR-X, adjusted the Accords 
at 110K and 160K miles respectively. Adjusted my CR-V at 67K a few weeks 
ago. None needed but the slightest of tweaks. In fact one of the 16 valve 
on the CR-V is worse now. Slightly too loose and needs to be tightened. The 
clearances required are about the thickness of PAPER (not card stock). My 
feeler gauges are so thin for these adjustments that the printing (not 
stamped) on the metal can be read on both sides clearly.

On VW's I will use hydraulics gladly for a stock type motor. If I was 
building a performance motor like Raby's I'd have solid lifters for sure. 
Hydraulic lifters are a compromise between performance and function. No 
adjustment but as I understand it there is an upper limit before they begin 
to pump up higher than they should and I'll bet the clearances between the 
moving parts within Raby's engines are close enough that they have 
clearance problems with hydraulic cylinders and 8000 rpm (connecting rods 
that grow and lifters that would (if they were hydraulic) pump up).

Build it stock and keep it under 5K rpm.

If I had the money I'd go buy an engine from Raby.
