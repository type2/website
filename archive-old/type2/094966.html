Subject: Re: [T2] Wierd Junkyard Find.

I had a similar vehicle, a '74 with a 1600dp. I loved it and would still 
have it if she hadn't been totalled as a result of a blown tire.

You can see her high in the mountains in the state of Zacatecas in Mexico 
at:

That &quot;high geared&quot; transmission currently resides in my '69 Riviera also 
pictured on the same page. Someone else installed the Westy pop-top, windows 
and 1600dp so I'm not too worried about keeping it stock.

&gt;I would imagine with almost 20 less horsepower and the taller gearing in
&gt;the later 091 trans it was a_bit_slow up the hills.  : )

&gt;
&gt;That's about what one would expect with that combination, however...
&gt;They intend to drive N. through Africa to Egypt, and perhaps all the way to 
&gt;N. Europe, before returning to the States with their trusty VW.
&gt;
&gt;FWIW...
