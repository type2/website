Subject: Airflow meter

New to the list, so forgive any poor etiquette. I just saw a posting from
someone looking for an airflow meter for a '79 bus. I would've replied to
that individual but I thought I'd send this out to the list. As I understand
it, I'm allowed to screw up on Fridays anyway right?

I have a '76 westy with a '78 powerplant in it. Rebuilt the engine myself
(three times now), and converted it from the FI to dual dellorto carbs while
it was in the '78. When I bought the '76 (much better body) I just dropped
my engine into it (well, I guess you don't _drop_ an engine into a bus
really). So, I have all or most of the original FI stuff from the '78 and
from the '76. It is taking up valuable shop space, and I'm no longer
interested in keeping it around.

I'll check part numbers or whatever if anyone is interested. I never
verified the operation of either engine with the FI, so you are taking
chances. Located in Louisville Ky area if it matters.............
