&gt; Quite the scene!

I never even TRIED to sleep up there before a pretty large friend and I
were goofing and he put his knee thru the canvas on my '72.  That was
about 4 years ago.  I just found it to be in my way.  

I stow all my stuff in the &quot;forward&quot; space created when I pop my top. 
The downside on the '72 - no REAL space up top to sleep, but it's great
for stashing yer stuff!

I can't imagine any adult sleeping in the front child's cot...  Maybe
I've just gotten to yuppified...  I like the foam padding!  And it's a
pain to get in there.  Had never even set it up, and did so about a week
ago.  It's damned difficult to get it in there without scratching up the
paint on the pillars.  I just pile up the front with more gear.
