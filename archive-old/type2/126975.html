&gt; Hello.  When I and others say something like 750C or 1670F, like below, the

&gt; I wanted to say 75-degrees-C or 167-degrees-F

Ah!  I really did not look at the fahrenheit number at all.  75-100C is
about in line with what I would expect from my method although I have
never measured it.  Freezing the pin as Terry K suggests would also work.

What you need to do is develop a temperature difference between the piston
and the pin and the one method is the same as the other in that respect.
My reason for heating the piston is that a 0C pin going into a 20C piston
is only a 20 degree difference whereas a 20C pin going into a 100C piston
is an 80 degree difference.  With a new piston this will not matter as
they are usually a tight slip-fit with no difference at all so any
difference is enough.

                             OOK!
