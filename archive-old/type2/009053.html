Thanks to Weber_at_zap-net_dot_com I found out that a pilot bearing puller can
be rented for onlt $6.00 in my area.  It's one of the sliding hammer type
pullers.  I am concerned about the side loads put on the bearings (Mains
and cam that is) when the hammer transmits this sideways force to the
crankshaft during the pilot bearing pulling.  Is this a concern, or am I
tilting at windmills?
