I have seen very few (if any) new wheels that look better on a loaf than the
original steel wheels.

So, last year I got my dirty rusty wheels off the bus and had them
sandblasted and powdercoated. That makes them look better than new. The cost
+/- $125 for five.

As for tires: you could use 195/75R14. These are slightly wider than stock
but will easily fit the standard rim.
Stock size is 185/75 R14.
