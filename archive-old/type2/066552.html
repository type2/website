Subject: Re: life of bus/engine

My 73 bus with original engine and tranny went 220K miles.
I was the 3rd owner and supposedly no work was done to wither the
engine or trans.  When I sold it, the engine was in real rough shape
as well as the body.

My 79 bus had a confirmed 206K miles on original engine and trans
when I sold it.  Orig owner drove it 80K miles, and sold it
in 1983.  2nd owner drove it to 180K, and sold it to me in 1994.
I drove it to 206K in 1996 then sold it.  Compression was 105/110
all around.  Trans felt just as good as any other bus.

I'm convinced anything below 100K miles on a late brealoaf is
&quot;almost new&quot;.  I would expect an original engine to go
220K miles(at least).  The trans should last even longer....
I think my experience with these 2 buses will explain why....
