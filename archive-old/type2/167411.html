Subject: Forrest Butcher's new artcar/old VW

Things you can do with an old VW van.

http://www.palmbeachdailynews_dot_com/arts/content/arts/artcar0421.html

Butch's car is a complete fabrication. He started with a VW camper  
van..cut the body completely off from it leaving two frame  
rails..period.  He then took 3/4 inch square stock tubing and made  
the shape of his body...which he covered in white metal roofing  
before it was corrugated as roofing. So..the car is wide..flat..and  
low. It looks a bit like a merge of a 24hr at Lemans._dot_car..and a  
modified dirt track racer. He calls it the Transportation ArtCar..  
or..History in Motion. On the top of this wide flat car..is a dirt  
road..that turns to gravel..then to asphalt. Along this road shows  
the progression of transportation..starting with a pair of baby doll  
feet..then a pair of moccasins..to a cave man wheel..the wheel on a  
cart pulled by a donkey to make work easier..to the model T..and so  
on to the space shuttle going off the back. All along the sides of  
this road..are scenes from history..He has the Boston Tea Party..the  
Wright Bros. first flight..The Transcontinental RR..where east met  
west..and other various scenes from Americana. Some scenes are set in  
clear plastic shadow boxes..set within the body..Little by little the  
car is completely being covered top and sides..with scenes of  
transportation.
