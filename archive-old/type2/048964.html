WOW.
Lots of useful bus content here.
I think i'll print this out and keep it in my Bentley manual.

Would you rather they all be listening to Korn and Godsmack and ripping off your stereo to score some crystal meth?

Your bus is an american cultural icon most closely associated with the 'counterculture' movement.  Your tendency towards the opposite isn't going to change this.
Ain't that justa bitch?

&gt; Hemp's probably still illegal because the hippies are so into the hemp-thing, and love to go around sporting &quot;help gear&quot; decorated with &quot;420&quot; images.

&gt; Buses existed before hippies, and they'll exist after the last hippie has faded into the acid-enhanced sunset; I just hope I live that long...
