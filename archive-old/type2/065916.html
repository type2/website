Another successful approach is to buy a TAP of a size that will just 
start into the bushing, if the bushing starts to spin, pull it out.  
If it doesn't keep tapping until the tap bottoms out and the bushing 
will then be forced out from the tap threads.  That you have the new 
bushing is VERY handy to use to size the tap.

&gt; 2 ways: use a bolt of the appriate size to screw into the old bushing and
&gt; pull it out, or, pull the motor and push it out with a socket or something.
