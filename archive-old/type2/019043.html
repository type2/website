'77.  No passenger side seat track.  Drill out the Vanagon spot welds, remove
donor tracks, position seat, tack down, remove seat, weld some more, try to refit
seat, grind out weld, repeat as necessary, weld in tracks, slide seat in.  Piece
of cake!  Only took about three days.  The upside is that I was able to position
the seat such that I retained the arm rests.  Might be a problem on the earlier
loafs with the air duct on the door.
