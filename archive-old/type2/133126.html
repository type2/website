Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuilt 2.0 FI - worst case scenario

GG,

ok, time to get serious.  Get the card or sheet that came with your cam
or call the webcam folks for the timing info.  Your sheet should
tell you when the intake valve opens and close and when the exhaust valve 
opens or closes.  Make darn shure that you are looking at the tdc mark and 
then rotate until you see the valve rise about .050 off of it's seat.

Then look at your pulley and decide if your timing is correct....do it 
again for closing of intake and opening and closing of exhaust...just to 
make sure.

Many years ago in a far away universe when I had a shop, a fellow mechanic 
brought me a bug that would do something similar to what yours is doing.
Brand new rebuilt engine...by him.  I fiddled with it a couple of days and 
couldn't get it to run any better than he did....he took it back, split 
the case, and sure enough...had gotten the cam  off by one tooth.

I just could not believe that he did it....


The webcam you put in is not stock and will give different timings than 
your stock one...read the sheet and think it thru.

other options...

No shop rags left in the intake anywhere?
S tube securely connected at both ends?...
Sounds to me like the engine is &quot;seeing&quot; lots of air and not much 
gas...which means that the afm is not seeing all of the air flow and not 
adjusting the injector timing accordingly, untill you get hi rpms.

You never did say whether it was smelling rich at 2000 or not...

Cheers, dave

&gt; One of the reasons I suspect the cam being out is the procedure Karl 
&gt; wrote (a week ago) to find #1 TDC:
&gt; 
&gt; When I do this the 'rocking point' on #3 is about 16 degrees before TDC 
&gt; on #1, which is NOT &quot;within a degree or 2&quot;.  With the webcam I know the 
&gt; lift is much greater than stock but I doubt it would affect the timing 
&gt; (at least that much).  Thus my suspicion of the cam being over a tooth.
&gt; 
&gt; How many teeth are in a cam gear?  Anyone know offhand? Then I could see 
&gt; if the degrees per tooth correlates to the ~16 degrees above. My only 
&gt; cam gear is buried in the engine...
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks to all so far.
