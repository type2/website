Subject: More Distributor Follys
Date: Sun, 22 Jul 2001 14:06:25 -0500

Hi,
 I posted the following about my 1977 Riviera a few days ago on the type2
list. Since then I pulled the valve cover off of the drivers side and turned
the engine (by hand clockwise) till the intake valve went down and started
to come up then turned till timing mark was at 0 on the timing scale. The
distributor rotor points to the mark on distributor? So... I think I put the
dist. back in right? Looking around the engine compartment for any loose
wires or hoses I did find one small (vacuum?) hose and wondered if anyone
could tell me what it does and what the symptoms might be if it was
disconnected. It comes off the passenger side &quot;Intake Air Distributor&quot;
between the &quot;Intake Manifolds&quot; , small maybe 1/4&quot; attaches to plastic? tube
running a couple of ft then 1/4&quot; tubing again to a round cylinder fastened
to the rear wall of engine compartment just under #1 sparkplug. I've looked
in all my books and photos and illustrations, non have my year and type
(1977 type 2) but on  page 140 of &quot;Idiots&quot; it shows a &quot;Pressure Sensor&quot;
coming off the drivers side that kinda looks like it?

My symptoms  have been engine dieing after running pretty good for about 14
mi, then no start till it cools down?

Any thought or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Ray

&quot;Yesterday I removed the distributor on my 1977 type 2 with vacuum advance
to
put in a new set of points. The engine wouldn't start, realized that the
distributor wasn't all the way down pushed it down and the Bus started up.
Set dwell and then timing, bus ran well. Headed into town 7 mi away still
running well, but as we got back it died in the driveway. The bus had been
running daily before yesterday with out major problems so suspect my work
yesterday screwed it up? It acted like it ran out of gas even though gauge
said quarter tank? Put more gas in and it started up but I was still suspect
as the gauge has always been accurate, tried town again to get a full tank
and see how low the gas really was, ran ok to town put in 7 gal? On the way
home running a little rough and when I slowed for a stop sign just short of
home it died again? Both times when it died the starter-engine would turn
over but no start, both times after the bus cooled off it started right up?
Now I'm thinking I installed the dist. wrong, but if so would it run at all,
would it cause these symptoms? Should I take it off and try again and if so
what's the best way to fine tdc for #1 cylinder (I've always found it by
matching the mark on the dist. with the rotor).

Any thought or help thanks in advance,

Ray
