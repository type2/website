Subject: Re: Does transmission gear oil ever wear out?

&gt; years. The owner's manual doesn't call for a change beyond the first 
&gt; service. I notice that the transmission is hard to shift when I first start 
&gt; up, but it gets easier as it warms. Does that suggest I should dump the old 
&gt; oil? Anyone think its important to get a certain weight or brand of oil?
I'd 


I had the same situation. My dad pointed to the phrase in the Chiltons
that said 'tranny oil never needs changed' and left it that way for 20 years.

Yes, I would change it. When you do your next oil change. 
Secret #1: Make sure the fill plug is out before you remove the drain plug.
If you drain it, then cant fill it, it will be hard to drive anywhere.
Besides,
it makes it easier to drain. Warm the tranny up first, too, just like you
should do with the engine oil.

I filled with Mobil 1 pure synthetic 75-90. Brand is unimportant. 
But, being synthetic is. My cold start sluggishness went away, the
bus was drivable on winter mornings again!

Now, if what you get out when you drain it is really cruddy, you
might want to clean the tranny first. You can use a couple of 
quarts of regular (non syntho) tranny oil for a couple of weeks
of driving around, then drain and fill with syntho. Or, as I have 
done on a bug, use straight 30 weight detergent motor oil
and run it around for a day or two, just dont do any heavy 
hauling or fast speeds. I used motor oil on a bug tranny and in
one 1/2 day drive it turned from golden to pure black.
