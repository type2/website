&quot;Was wondering if those who have replaced their points with an electronic 
ignition would care to comment on the process and proformance after the 
installation.&quot;

A few years ago Karl kindly urged me toward a Vanagon electronic rig, that I 
installed on a 77 engine. After a few miscues on my part..have about 20K  
miles of trouble...and tune...free running. I like not having to mess with 
points..and tho I check timing each lube job..it has been smack-on since 
installation.

Marv Krupp..always looking for the easy way out..
