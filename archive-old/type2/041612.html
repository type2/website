Subject: Re: hello again and westy interior needs

I had an open fronted one in an early westy (72 I think?) and I just removed 
one with a door on the front of it from a 76 that installed perfectly in my 
current 74.  (I actually liked the open front better)

I found mine by responding to an add for a rough westy and called wanting 
some parts.  He didn't want to part it out yet.  Two weeks later the seller 
called me back; couldn't sell the bus; was willing to part it out.  It might 
be worth a try.
