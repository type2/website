Subject: Re: [T2] Tape Deck for My 79

&gt;Sorry to bring bad news, but the chances of finding a good used cassette
&gt;deck is just about nil.  They are usually removed because the cassette
&gt;drive stops working and the repair cost exceeds the cost of a new unit.
&gt;At that point, they go on the garage sale table.  Since you can't easily
&gt;test them, you don't know what you are getting.

Find some 17 year old hell-bent on his first $3,000 stereo system. Offer 
him or her $25 for the OEM radio that they are removing. Stereo installers 
might have cheap used OEM radios too. The Honda tape decks have always been 
good to me. I recently installed an-ex-Accord tape player on my Honda 
motorcycle to replace the analog manual tuning radio/tape deck. It's 
digital and has preset buttons so it is less likely to get me killed while 
trying to tune the radio to the next station. (also a lighted front).

Value? $15 tops I'd guess. In my case the Honda named stereo on my Honda 
motorcycle works out well.
