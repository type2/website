Subject: Re: [T2] Heater blower running hot

&gt; A simple question re my heater blower in my type 4 engine. I was
&gt; running a 10A fuse and that blew. I replaced with a 13A and that blew
&gt; and then a 15A and that blew. I noted a previous thread re blowing
&gt; fuses however it hasn't been archived yet?!? I have a spade type fuse
&gt; holder and my local parts shop does not have the required 16A fuse (I
&gt; finally looked it up in Bentley).

Did you replace the original holder?

&gt; I thus did what should not be done
&gt; but put a 20A fuse in. All seems to run OK but the fan does get hot,
&gt; not too hot to touch but hot none the less.

How hot do the wires get? The smaller ones closest to the fan.

&gt; I will get a 16A fuse however my quetion to some owners is; could
&gt; anybody give me an indication if their fan runs hot?

I've never noticed that.
 
&gt; Also why is this fan so big and draws such high current?

As the fan gets older is will draw excess amounts of current until it seizes
completely. It normally draws 6-7A at idle, hence the double rated fuse.

Junkyard is the best bet for replacement as the NOS fans seem to have dried
up (cip1 was the last source I knew of a couple of years ago).

When you rotate the squirrel cage by hand, you should feel some resistance
but it's not rubbing, it's the magnets inside. Any kind of noise is
unwanted.
