This came from the Type2 library and I have heard this before:

unless the oil pressure light is on (in which case you must shut the engine
off immediately!), let the engine run. Glen Buhlman recommends that it not
be left idling, but that revving it will allow the fan to do a better job of
cooling the engine.
- do you keep your engine lid open to &quot;let heat escape&quot;? Don't. For better
cooling and to make work easier for the fan (hence the engine), you need
positive air pressure

Don't want anybody to ruin their engine!! TGIF!!

&gt; that seems hot to me, I try not to get over 230, at 240 I slow down to
&gt; about 55-60 which seems to be where mine runs coolest, at 250 I pull over
&gt; under a tree, open the rear door and let in idle til it cools down
