My 75 1800 bus has been running like a hairy goat over the past few days,
and so, armed with armfuls of tools, I headed off to fix it. I have Solex
dual carbies, and it turned out that on the LHS carby, the electrical wire
had simply fallen off! Doh! At least I had it fixed within 30 seconds!

Is this the DM method, Doktor Tim?
