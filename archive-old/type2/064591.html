&gt;Subject: 1-nite get-together 10/12 at Muir Beach!

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;For a long time, I've been wanting for us all to gather at Pelican
&gt;Inn in Muir Beach, California (west of San Rafael).  This is a
&gt;British pub, complete with darts.  One can go there to drink, eat,
&gt;play, etc.  It's sort of off in the middle of not much else, and
&gt;very authentic English-country in style -a beautiful place.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, I'm proposing that those interested meet there for an evening
&gt;gathering on October 12th, beginning at 6 p.m.  Starting time
&gt;can be loose.  I think one can still order dinner at that time, or
&gt;if you just want to begin drinking early, that's ok too.
&gt;
&gt;I'll work on getting exact directions for you.  Despite being in
&gt;a remote setting, it's not difficult to find, nor very far to
&gt;get to.
&gt;
&gt;Please let me know if you plan to attend.  So far, the Kautz family
&gt;and Bradley Prunehead have signed up.  And I know many more of
&gt;you have expressed an interest.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!
&gt;

&gt;   and last but not least:  a pair of those old-fashioned metal roller-skates,
&gt;    made, I think, by Winchester (but any would do) - the kind which fasten
&gt;     onto the outside of your shoes and are length- and width-adjustable
&gt;      with a metal key.  They have leather straps for the ankle.  They were
&gt;       very popular in the 60's.
