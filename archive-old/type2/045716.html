Volks,

When I measure the fuel pressure on my '77 with my new Actron fuel
pressure gauge and with the engine running, the gauge flutters.  It
fluctuates between a large flutter over a range of about 14 degrees, and
over a lesser range of about 6 degrees.  Presumably the flutter
represents the opening and closing of the injector valves--which, if I
recall correctly, all fire simultaneously.  But I would have expected
the range of gauge flutter to be pretty much constant.

I'm hoping (1) that someone can confirm that the gauge should be
fluttering, and perhaps (2) that someone can offer either some kind of
explanation for the variation in its range, or at least confirm that
it's not abnormal.

The pressure was high at 33 psi with the vacuum hose attached (28 is
specified), and at 38 psi with the hose disconnected and plugged (35 is
specified).  It seems to me that this may explain the 10% CO measurement
that cause the bus to fail Atlanta Emissions.  Tomorrow when I have
daylight, I will replace the fuel pressure regulator (I have three
spares, so I figure one should work), and then head off to the Muffler
King for my retest.  However, even if I pass this time around, I still
plan to have the mixture measured and set slightly rich for maximum
power and cool running after the test is over.  If I fail, I'll have the
mixture set for best emissions, with instructions on how many turns back
in (clockwise) to turn it to set it where I want it.
