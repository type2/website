	I did my ball joints on my 68 six years back and was fairly straight
forward if you approach it correctly . I can't remember what the manual said
but I think it required a special tool that Volkswagen made way back when
and I was unable to locate one . I decided to remove the control arms
completely and inspect the torsion leaves and clean ,degrease and regrease
every thing(needle bearings, the leaves) My seals on the end were still good
so I didn't replace them but now I think I should have. I paid 39.00 each
for the ball joints in 1993. The funny part is when I tried to take the ball
joints out  of the control arms myself . I have a 12 ton press and I made a
jig to press on the correct spots . Well after soaking it with penetrating
oil ,heating it with a torch and hanging on the press hydraulic pump lever
(all 280 LB of me) I got no were. So I took the control arms to alignment
shop that specialized in Big truck like semi's. they had a 60 ton press .
After a while there was six guys gathered around the press in disbelief when
it was maxing out there machine to get the old ball joints out( get a price
for the work before hand). What a sound they made when they let lose. After
that every thing went smoothly.

&gt;Content-Disposition: inline

&gt;I am trying to find some one in the charlotte NC with a hydraulic press,
who can press out ball joints.  Does any &gt;one know of anywhere?  I have
tried every trick in the book, and I can't get these to budge.  Every one
has said &gt;that getting them pressed out and the new ones pressed in is the
only way to go.  I just can't find anywhere that &gt;has one.  I am open to
suggestions, and repair place recommendations.  Any help is appreciated
greatly!!!  &gt;Thanks!!!
