Subject: Solex 32-34PDSIT-2 carbs...

------=_NextPart_001_0005_01C21AC4.2D7BDE80

Hello

I have a 1973 Bus manufactured in 9/73. (VIN 2232252794) I am having some=
 time with the brain carb (Solex 32-34PDSIT-2).  I found a replacement fo=
r it, brand spanking new and in the box still, and for only 50 bucks!  Bo=
y was I happy. Until I opened the box...  Yes it does have Solex 32-34 PD=
SIT-2 on the side of it, however, it is the same, yet it is different. It=
 does not have the Electro magnetic cutoff value ( central idling system)=
, Idle mixture enrichment, Central Idle system mixture screw, or Idle spe=
ed adjusting screw (central idle system). It does not have the two idling=
 system and air cleaner tubes on the top part of the body near these othe=
r part either.  But then... Bessie-Lou does not have her Electro magnetic=
 cutoff value ( central idling system) or Electro magnetic cut off value =
, idling system hooking up either.  (looks like the Solex 32-34PDSIT-3, b=
ut backwards...) There are no wires there for them period...   I am wonde=
ring things.. I was told I could just replace this one with the old even =
though they are different... however then there is no hook up for the idl=
ing system or air cleaner hoses.  Can I take the top section off my old c=
arb and put it onto the new one?  I do have a rebuild kit for the old one=
, however of course it does not have a new float or fixes for the worn th=
rottle shaft bushings...  The old one also slowly drips gas into the carb=
 when she is not running so I am concerned with that as well. ( in other =
words, the old carb seems shot to me..)

Do you have any suggestions other that buying a  new carb kit? and if it =
is new carbs... which ones?  Please do not tell me to take it to a carb p=
lace for rebuild.  I tried that and the guy in town would not touch it...=
  :(

Anyhow, any help would be greatly appreciated.  I just bought Bessie-Lou =
(as my sons and I affectionately call) her less than a month ago and we a=
re still getting to know one another, but I know she is a good little ol =
car , she just needs some TLC  :) ( hopefully with out draining my bank a=
ccount again next month...)

Thanks,

:)
