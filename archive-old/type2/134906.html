Subject: Re: [T2] Honda's new truck

I could not resist the temptation of writing a note to Mr. Phelan telling 
him he was missing the fact that VW did the same 50 years back, and the 
dangerous of spread innacurate info on the Web, I am also send the link to 
the dropgate page for further information.
As Rob Henley said I do not know if this will have any afect but I feel a 
lot better now.
