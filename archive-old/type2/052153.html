Subject: [T2] Gas mileage woes..part 3

Hello all,

Well, just when I thought I had all of my MPG problems solved, It rears it's
ugly head again!!
Went to go visit a fellow listee when I noticed the gas gauge dropping as
fast as my speed, after about 20 miles. Pulled over and looked to see if it
was leaking, none seen, and to make sure everything was still in time, which
it was.

Here is what I have done:
Replaced Temp sensor, replace fuel pressure regulator, set timing, set
rpm's, set dwell all to specs, changed spark plugs, and gave it an oil
change. All vacumme lines are hooked up and replaced the rubber elbow going
to the airbox.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!
