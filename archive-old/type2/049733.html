Subject: [T2] '79 rebuild question

A guy just offered to sell me a '79 bus for less than $100. It is in fair
shape, but the engine needs to be rebuilt (it has a cracked jug).

I've done a couple 1600 uprights, but I am clueless about what is going on
in the engine compartment of this '79. (I admit to only having spent 5
minutes looking around the engine). I figure I can learn, but I will avoid
the vehicle if my learning costs are too high. What I want to know is
whether I am going to have to learn a whole lot of new things, or whether
the knowledge I have acquired from working on '71 and earlier busses and
bugs will be useful for the '79.

I am also looking for suggestions on where to buy an engine rebuild kit for
the '79.

Any and all comments most welcome!

Thanks!
Steve Leonard
