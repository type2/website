Hi all,  
    I know I am late to chime in on this one, but;
    I once bought a 70 bus that had apparently lost it's reverse lights.  So, 
PO ran 14 gauge wires from reverse lights all the way under the bus to the 
floor just under the shifter.  From there, the wires were duct taped (of 
course) up the side of the shifter, to just below the shift knob.  There, he 
installed a momentary contact push-button switch, and ran the other end 
UNFUSED to the hot side of the fuse box.   
     Whenever you wanted your reverse lights on, you would have to have your 
hand on the shifter holding the button down!!
