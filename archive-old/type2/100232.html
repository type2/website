Subject: [T2] Flooded engine

In Re: [T2] Flooded engine. Really., it was said::

&gt;&quot;My plan is to attach a 5&quot; piece of vacuum line underneath the hole...&quot;
&gt;&quot;so as little hot air as possible gets pulled into the engine compartment&quot;


Help me out here, people. If I am driving 60MPH down the highway, do you 
think that ANY of the hot air under my bus is going to leach its way over 
one foot to either side of the engine, and seep into my 'fully' enclosed, 
positive pressured engine compartment.  And particularly flow up stream 
against that small air flow coming out of the hole(s) so fore mentioned.

I rest my case, I rust my cake, I rent my cast???
