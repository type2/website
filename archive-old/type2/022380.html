&gt;For the kids, a couple of spray bottles and a cooler full of beverages
&gt;will make all the difference. 

I'll second this.  Spray bottles are a must - one per person.  As a bonus, kids can have fun with them.


&gt;Get in the habit of starting the day's travels early and take it easy in
&gt;the midday sun. 

In Texas, the temperature peaks around 5pm.  Traveling in the morning is downright pleasant even in the dead of summer.  If it were me, I would leave reasonably early in the morning (like 7) and stop for the day around 2-3pm when it really starts to get hot.  Check into a cheap motel and jump in the pool during the afternoon, then go hang out in an air-conditioned mall till the sun goes down.  :-)

There is no quick or easy way to put A/C into a bus.  It takes time, money, and research.  It can, however, be done and it can work quite well.  Then you will have more comfort and flexibility on long trips.
