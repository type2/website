&gt; My 79 Bay will do this once and a while. All I have to do is to use a

&gt; not one hooker up to another car. I think that when my battery is not

&gt; juice from a separate battery or charger works everytime for me. Keeping 
&gt; a full charge on my battery I never have a problem. I have a separate 
&gt; ampilifer that was always drawing a small current from my battery. The 
&gt; lights worked perfect but it would not start. Now I have wired the amp 
&gt; to only turn on when I turn the key to start. It seems when my battery 
&gt; drops to a certain level it will not activate the brain or selonid.  Cree

Seems plausible.  Since I didn't get any clicking I didn't suspect the
solenoid seriously.  I'm sure I probably have some small juice drains.
I've got some fuses out of it due to some wiring issues (started by
previous owner) relating to the interior lights, radio and wiper circuits.

Isn't there also some kind of &quot;relay&quot; or something to keep you from
turning the key twice without fully turning it off?  Or is that simply
part of the ignition switch?  Potential for a fault?

Perhaps I'll put it on the charger just to top it up since it hasn't
been run enough to give it a FULL charge and start carrying my booster
pack with me.

Of course, I could also park it where I can drift start it as often as
possible.  That worked out pretty well yesterday considering I wasn't
expecting it.
