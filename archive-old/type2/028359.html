Folks,

This is my first original posting to this list.  I have been watching it,
and adding to an occaisional thread for the last few months.  I was on here
as &quot;pj1435&quot; until I changed my mail program.

Okay, I spent the money to get a new turn indicator switch - the thing just
below the sterring wheel not to be confused with the relay switch.  First,
I've a '72, so it's a one year only item.  Picked it up from Wolfsburg
West - so I hope I got the right item.

Anyway, I install it using the half of the old one to attach it to becuase I
couldn't get my sterring wheel off.  Wired it in...thought correctly.
Tested it and guess what?  My right turn signal works.  My left doesn't and
my headlights still come on, but there isn't any little click in the arm
when I try to apply high beams - and nothing happens to the head lights.

Any suggestions?  Tomorrow morning I'm going to tackle it again to make sure
all connections are secure.  Other than that, I'm at a loss - especially
with the lack of headlight reaction.

I hope I was clear on this explanation.

Thanks in advance for your assistance.

By the way, the part number is 211953513J.

Phil
