Subject: new wiring harness mains and completes for our buses

Howdy,

After countless inquiries for complete wire harnesses we are finally going
to give it a try. We have a customer looking for a complete harness for a
'78 bus and we have a fairly complete wire system on a few '78 parts buses
and we are going to rebuild one. At the same time we will see what it would
take to remanufacturing them from scratch.

This is all with out a lot of hind site. We have pulled harnesses many time
but never careful enough to catalog everything, just bits and pieces. So the
reason for this email is to encourage anyone to speak up, in anyway.
Discouragement, encouragement, concerns ext. I have talked to Bob at wire
works about there products and his feelings on the later bus stuff. It just
gets to involved he says. He makes '68-'69, '70-'71, and '72 main harnesses
that we have available now for $140, $153, and $160 respectively.

Once we have completed this project, shooting for the end of this month, we
should have a handle on what it would take to remanufacture the '77-'78
complete harnesses. Hoping for some good feedback.........
