&gt; I use Coca-cola Classic.
&gt; I actually cleaned my entire engine last night with a 12pack of coke. I was
&gt; thinking of writing a letter to the company thanking them for making a
&gt; product that is so toxic it can break up goop that is 30+yrs old. Man am I
&gt; glad I don't drink it though imagine what it would do to your stomach if it
&gt; can degrease a VW engine.

It's the phosphoric acid in it that does it. This is also good for unseizing
engines (just dump some down each cylinder, with the heads on and rocker
shafts off, and leave for a while) and even cleaning printing presses.

I don't think the little dab of phosphoric acid will hurt your stomach;
search for &quot;pH of bile&quot; to see why.

Get well, Mary!
