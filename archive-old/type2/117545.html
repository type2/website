yes they are throttle cables.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Will a 72-79 cable work in my '71?  Please let me know.  My local VW guy
&gt; &gt; &gt; only has a late bay cable.  I was driving to school this morning and it
&gt; &gt; &gt; broke.  I had a cable but the wrong one.  It was for my '60!

&gt; 
&gt; Ummm, an Automatic Transmission clutch cable?  Are you sure this isn't a
&gt; listing of throttle cables?
