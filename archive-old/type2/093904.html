Subject: RE: [T2] Buying a bus for the first time... 

Thanks much for the info, everyone on this list has been SOOO helpful!  

I'm very much in the same position as Meredith (climbing on board...)- just
had a kid, find that my car is too small, want a larger daily driver that
isn't a freaking SUV.  Certainly not afraid to get my hands dirty (can't be
a female tackle-football player and be afraid to get a bit roughed-up) - in
fact I've been looking in my area for a class on rebuilding engines and
basic mechanics (no luck so far).  I'm in PA, very close to the NJ border
(Newtown/Yardley area)... anyone got some time to look at a transporter in
trade for some beer, pizza, web development?
