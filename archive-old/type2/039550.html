Subject: RE: Fuel Injection to Carbs?

I've converted two engines to Carbs from FI. Have been very (very) pleased
both times. Neither engine ran when I received the vehicle(s), so I can't
comment on how the FI systems worked pre-conversion. My current 79 Westy has
dual DellOrto's and it runs very strong. I'm a little frightened that I
can't remember what size those carbs are, but I've changed venturi sizes
several times anyway to get power characteristics that I like (strong low
and mid range at the cost of top end). 

I really encourage anyone considering this route to go for it. My dual carbs
are a breeze to set-up and maintain (get the good UniSyn tool), the look
cool, and I just like Italian pieces. Don't be frightened by the
synchronization prospect. It is very straightforward and once set, doesn't
get out of whack easily. There is an _excellent_ article on (I think)
aircooled_dot_net describing the procees. A link to it was posted here several
days ago. I've been synching my carbs for probably 10 years, and I learned
from the article.

As always, there are certainly many widely varying opinions and experiences
relative to a carb conversion, mine is just one.

Subject: Fuel Injection to Carbs?


    Hello everyone.  The gas tank pull and reinstall
was successful.  Thanks to everyone for all the help
and advice.  Yesterday, my bus started (very
reluctantly) for the first time in 2 years.  The
problem is that once it started, It was at full
throttle and wouldn't come down.  The only way it
would start is with a friend playing with the vaccuum
lines.  They are made out of vinyl tubing, is this
correct?  Or should I replace them with some sturdier
rubber tubing?  Also after removing a fuel injector,
there was a bit of crud in them, looked like sand, but
hard to tell.  Is there a method I should use to try
and clean them?  One other question.  Are there any
members out there that have switched from fuel
injection to carberators?  I've just never had to deal
with fuel injection before and it has me a bit lost. 
Sorry this is so long and thanks again everyone.  =)

Shawn
76 Westy
