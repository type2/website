Subject: [T2] Leaky oil breather on 2Liter ACVW

Listees,
    I have a 2 liter ACVW Vanagon Westy that has less than 3000 miles on a
rebuild.  It is of European origin, so it never had fuel injection, so I
have put a set of Weber 44's on it.  It runs good, but it has an oil leak
out of the crappy setup the PO had for the crankcase breather.

Attached are 2 pics, and when I go for a run oil drips out of this makeshift
tube.  I want to have said oil go back into the motor, for it loses about a
half quart per 1000 miles out of this setup.  Also, it sure would help to
keep things tidy.  I have nothing to go by, so any suggestions would be
helpful.  Here are the pics.
