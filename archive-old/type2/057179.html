Subject: 78 Bus Fuel Problem Solved
Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

The 78 bus is once again running....the garage pulled off the fuel filter
and nothing came out of the line. They blew in some air into the fuel line
coming from the tank and voila....the fuel began to flow.

The 78 had sat for 2 or 3 years. When we had the engine redone, the fuel
tank had a bunch of crap in it so we had it taken out and chemically
cleaned. I think that what is happening now is that there was probably lots
of crap in the rest of the fuel system that has now made its way back to
the tank.

I'm going to put a second filter on the return line to the tank and
hopefully grab more crap from the lines. I really don't want to pull the
tank...
