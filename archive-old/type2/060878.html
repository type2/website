Subject: reason for being under-powered?

Hi Volks!
Those of us w/older t2s have to deal w/them being under powered.Has anyone ever researched why they were made that way in the first place?Were the vw designers of the 60's and 70's insane when they put such small engines in such big vehicles, or was this some kind of cruel joke? You would think that a company w/the same origins as Porsche and a country w/ the autobahn as their highway system would have produced faster cars.Does anyone know why this is,or know of any web sites that discuss it?
