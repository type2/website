Subject: Re: Engine Hesitation tech article


&gt;Some-one posted that a tech article is available for re-building 34's when
&gt;using a 009. Err, where is this article?

Well, there is an article that is sort of famous (whether it should be or
not) that can be found at http://www.bostonengine_dot_com/articles/009.html It
has to do with blocking up the hole in the throttle plate. I have known
several people to rave about this solution but I can't vouch either way.

When I got Pandora the hole in her throttle plate was soldered shut and she
didn't idle worth a damn, and ran like any other 009 (flat spots), but
there was a lot wrong with that carb besides so I can't say anything
intelligent.

&gt;Is it on Type2_dot_com? The Hoover CD?

There is an incomplete series on EVERYTHING you could want to know about
the 34-3 that Bob wrote but it didn't make it into this edition of the CD.
My take is that the 34-3 and 34-4 are carbs that are designed to prevent
excessive HC emissions on overrun, and they have to be dealt with that way.
Simply trying to defeat the anti-pollution mechanism is not enough because
the whole carb is designed as a system (it's not just a hole in the
throttle plate) and you can't just put a cork in part of the system and
expect to improve it.

If you want to know what &quot;excessive emissions on overrun&quot; means, get in
your bus and feather the throttle in and out. Watch the tailpipe for the
clot of black smoke when you release the throttle. Ideally, the 34 series
carbs are not supposed to do that (and are supposed to drive well besides).
Since the mechanical distributors require big jolts of fuel to do what the
vacuum distributors can do with mere air pressure, the 009s defeat the 34
carbs whenever they are accelerating.
