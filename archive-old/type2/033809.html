Here we go again!

Earlier this year over 55 VW buses gathered together for a weekend of bus
fun for the entire family. They came from as far away as Boston, St Louis
and Hamilton Ontario in their buses loaded with kids, bicylcles,dog and all
the other stuff we carry around in our buses like floor jacks, spare parts
and potato cannons:) It was so much fun we are gonna do it again!

The event will take place on April 14,15 and 16 2000  in the same location
as last year, Hagan Stone Park which is located just south of Greensboro,
NC.

last years EveryBus. If you have pics that you want to email from last year

Hagan-Stone Park is a 400 acre park, campground and wildlife refuge located
just south
of Greensboro, NC. HSP has lotsa walking and hiking trails, playgrounds for
the kids, and
peaceful areas to just get away from it all! EveryBus will be taking over
the RV field for
the weekend as well as a picnic shelter. We have reserved 30 campsites that
include
hookups and picnic tables. Tent camping will be allowed in the RV field for
our group. Any
overflow of buses can be accommodated in the tent loop or other RV loop.
Fees for
camping are $12.00 per night per campsite. I will be collecting so just look
for the ratty
72 &quot;Westfakia Camper&quot; so you can sign up.

HSP is a public campground so...... Pets are allowed as long as they are
leashed and being
attended to. Quiet hours are 11pm to 7am. etc etc etc. Please be cool. You
know what I
mean :)&gt;

                                                                         

                                        Friday: arrive early and get a good
spot.

                                              Friday night:hardcore
relaxation.

                                          Saturday afternoon: socialize and
eat!

                                        Saturday night: bonfire and door
prizes,

 Sunday: Carabus to the IVWA Spring Nationals at Farmington, NC (
parts,swap, car show
                                                              Type1 drags)

                     The good folks at IVWA will arrange a discount for our
caravan.

 How do I get there? Find Intersate 40. Drive to Greensboro, NC. Take
Insterstate 40
  exit 127 for US 421 South. Follow US 421 South into the countryside until
you reach a
  stoplight in the middle of nowhere, Take a right onto Hagan-Stone Park
Road. Go a few
 miles and the park entrance will be on your right. If you arrive after dark
the gates will
        be closed but not locked. IF YOU OPEN THE GATES YOU MUST CLOSE THEM
