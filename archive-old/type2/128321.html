Subject: Re: [T2] flywheel rattling

&gt; I've had the misfortune to find that the rattle I hear upon start up is not
&gt; the engine tin --- it's the loose flywheel. Apparently the PO didn't tighten
&gt; things properly when he changed the clutch before I bought Slo Rojo (lesson:
&gt; get a torque wrench), and now it seems that I can't tighten it enough to
&gt; prevent rattling.
&gt; Is there such a thing as a shim (or any fix for that matter) that I can use
&gt; without splitting the case and having the flywheel and crank machined? How
&gt; long do you all think I have on her (as a daily driver)? Is this a slow or a
&gt; rapid degeneration? I'm getting a rattle on cranking, and a squeal that is
&gt; intermittent while in gear. The squeal usually stops after a few minutes of
&gt; driving.

did you pull the flywheel and look at the dowels? are the holes buggered
up?
there is a jig that allows 4 new dowel holes to be drilled in the crank
without breaking the case open. so essentially you have an 8 doweled crank
end but you just use the 4 new holes.
I dont think I would try it myself even with the jig. I would think best..
a vw friendly machine shop, lesser... see if you can get a loaner jig and
have a local machine shop do it, lastly... just go to a local machine shop
cold and see what they think.

or is it possible that the gland nut or threads are buggered? you need to
have the flywheel off and evaluate.
