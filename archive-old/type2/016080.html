Subject: Brazil Solex 30/31-PICT jetting (120 main)

I purchase a new Brazil 30/31 6 months ago for the backup 1971 bus.  This
has a &quot;questionable&quot; 1600DP.  Due to a overheating I had, I decided to
re-jet the main jet.

These Brazil Solex come with a 120 Main Jet -- which is more suited to a
15000 than a 1600, right?

My bus had more power when I went to 127.5 and even went up to 135 -- which
had even more power, but starting to run rich.  I'm running a BugPack Single
Quiet Pack exhaust, which is a factor.

I purchased the &quot;base plate&quot; with mine, which adapts the smaller throat to
the dual port intake, plus is nicely offsets the carb to the left, away from
generator / alternator.

I'm still having the same overheating, but a lot more power :)

The 30 PICT-1 is about the best Solex you can get for a 1600, IMHO.

It adjusts like most &quot;normal&quot; carbs; no idle bypass circuit. You set idle
speed and mixture just like your 28.

This was the stock carb for the '65 1500 T-2.

If you like the 009 dizzy, this is the carb to use;&gt;)

&gt; Anyone have any recent experience that would shed light on the
&gt; cheaper carb?  Made by aborigines from scrap tin?  What works?  I
&gt; guess if I can't find out anything more about this cheaper one I'll
&gt; buy from Ron, but at 60% of the higher priced carb, this &quot;30-PICT
&gt; Carb&quot; sounds like a much better deal.
