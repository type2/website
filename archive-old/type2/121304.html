&gt;What Richard said!  WW is NOT jerking your chain when they say in their

I prefer horsehair to foam. It's the correct firmness and a PERFECT fit. Granted tushes require more softness as the years go by but in this case I think VW knew what they were doing. Every time I've driven 750 mile days in the bus I've felt great at the end of the day. I can't do this in my wife's 96 Acura without the usual hip and leg pains.

See my seat restoration for the process:

WW gets the padding from the original vendor in Europe and they order them in batches of 1000 so when they run out it takes a while for them to get them back in stock. I'd hardly call it a reproduction.
