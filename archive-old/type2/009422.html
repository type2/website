&gt;Steve (and others):
&gt;The 72-74 type 4 motors (and maybe slightly later) had really nice METAL
&gt;timing scales with white backgrounds and numbers painted on, so if you
&gt;see a 72-74 bus being parted out that's a nice part to rescue!

But if you hit them with carb spray....the numbers go by-by and you are left 
with a white strip. The plastic ones have raised numbers that don't wipe off 
:)
