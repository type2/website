&gt; I didn't just inherit the tools.  I bought them a while ago after
&gt; buying a wimpy used compressor.  I bought the new compressor, and let's
just
&gt; say that prior to having it, too much air pressure was _not_ a concern with
&gt; my last compressor :-)  Of course, I immediately lost the manuals for all
of
&gt; them just after flipping through them and looking at the pictures.
&gt;
&gt;    A friend of mine bought a Makita-blue 4 1/2 inch grinder from Odd Lot
Trading for $14.99...Other than sounding like the bearings were lubed
with gravel, the instruction manual recommended using the grinder at
a 30 degree centigrade angle to the work... ;-(
