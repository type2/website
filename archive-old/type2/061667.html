&gt;  I'd also want to check that it would handle the load. I think these things are marginal for their intended use, they may be dangerously underspecified for a type-2.

         Boy, I'd bet that most Mercedes weigh a good bit more than a type2. My '73 Westy weighs 3400lbs empty, and my son's RX-7 weighs more than that -- I'll bet a
bigger Mercedes sedan weighs at least 5000lbs.  And none of those things are for serious use -- they're only meant to allow you to limp to the nearest tire repair
place. After all, if you have to put it on a drive axle, there's a serious size difference --  your differential won't be happy if you go far with it.
      But I like the idea, in a way. It's something to think about, if a suitable place could be found to put it -- *not* inside. OTOH, if you're doing much back
country trekking -- like Baja or the Rockys -- I think I'd want to have a full-size spare. And if I got rid of my front tire mount, then I'm back to where to put the
bikes!
Actually, why would you want to get rid of the front tire mount? They look kinda' cool, I think.
