It helps to use a clean piece of heavy fabric - canvas works well - between
the chrome and the sand.  Otherwise the sand can mar the chrome finish and
you may not be able to polish out the small pits and hazing that result.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  I doubt if you ever will get the hub caps back to 100%---But the best
method i have found
is placing the hub cap in sand---like at a kids playground--Put the chrome
part facing
down into the sand--Then Lightly start tapping out the dent --from the
Outside of the dent
-towards the middle--Do Not start in the middle----A hard rubber mallet
works best--take
your time--After a while you will get a feel as to just how hard to hit the
hub
cap--Always better to Light then too heavy--  &lt;&lt;
