Absolutely correct, Barry.  The lights are controled by two pressure-
sensative switches mounted on the master cylinder.  You need a bit of
pressure on the fluid in the MC to activate them.  Should not be more than
a brick or two will supply, tho.

&gt; Now, here is the 'hint from Heloise':  Pull the emergency brake handle out
&gt; to the first click, and the 'B' light will come on.  While the 'B' light is
&gt; on, depress the brake pedal and when the brake lights come on, the 'B' light
&gt; will flicker slightly.  This can conveniently be done while driving, to get
&gt; an idea when you are flashing your brake lights. Remember to maintain an
&gt; adequate supply of bricks as your brake pads/shoes wear down.

Barry,

(Semi-)bad news... this works fine on your '78, but this is not true of
all years.  I am not sure when the changes occured, but VW used three
different mechanisms to test the filament in the &quot;B&quot; lamp.  The three
options, depending on year/model are:

the &quot;B&quot; lamp lights when you press on it;
the &quot;B&quot; lamp lights when you put the key in the &quot;start&quot; position;
the &quot;B&quot; lamp lights when you apply the parking brake.

I know for certain that the first procedure was used on my '71 Super
Beetle, the second was used on my '73, and the third was used on my '78.
