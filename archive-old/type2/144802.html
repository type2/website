Subject: Re: [T2] Gas leaks?

Great post.  Fire extinguishers are a necessity in a
bus.  I've used mine before to prevent a fire when I
stupidly tried changing a fuel pump on the side of the
road with the engine hot.  Didn't have a clamp and
couldn't keep the fuel from running out on a hot
engine.  I barely missed serious injury.  I doused it
with powder and hooked the old one up until it cooled.

I mount mine behind the passenger seat.  It is easy
for me to reach over and get it if I have to and it
doesn't get in the way too much.  Cheers...KR

&gt; I think this might be a good time to discuss fire
&gt; extinguishers, and how
&gt; surprised I am about how many people who own a
&gt; Volkswagen don't carry a fire
&gt; extinguisher. With all the work and time (and money)
&gt; i have put into my
&gt; beloved BusZilla (and any other Volkswagen) I ALWAYS
&gt; carry a fire
&gt; extinguisher for each and every Volkswagen i own.
