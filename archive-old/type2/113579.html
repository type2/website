Subject: Re: [T2] looking for 74 stove picture (now rust removal)

&gt;I assume you meant using a buffing wheel on Stainless steel. This works well
&gt;in my experience. Actually, on small stuff, like a stove top, my favorite is
&gt;using a Dremel with a buffing wheel and the &quot;Brite!&quot; polish I mentioned.
&gt;Nice and shiny, and easy to get into all of the little nooks.
&gt;
&gt;This may be a bit exessive when it comes to buffing wheels, but good
&gt;stainless shops don't mix thier tools between mild and stainless
&gt;applications. IE: If you use a stainless wire wheel to clean welds on mild
&gt;steel, the wheel will pick up mild steel, then contaiminate any stainless it
&gt;is used on, resulting in rust. I don't take any chances, and keep separate
&gt;wheels and buffers for stainless work.

Good to know. I was given a plain electric motor and then I bought an arbor 
and a buffing wheel and rouge. I've done just a little bit of buffing with 
it in the past on aluminum. VERY good results. Total cost = $30 for supplies.

Any idea how to re-anodize aluminum at home?
