Subject: Re: [T2] Wheel balancing in CT?

&gt; &gt; Has anyone been able to find a tire shop in CT to balance old style 5
&gt; &gt; lug wheels?  I've been calling around all afternoon, and the closest
&gt; &gt; I've gotten is Town fair tire saying their warehouse truck tire place
&gt; &gt; can balance any rim with at least three holes, but I'd have to buy my
&gt; &gt; tires there. (tires are already bought)  Even the old timer place near
&gt; &gt; my house said they hadn't used their adapter in years, and think they
&gt; &gt; got rid of it.

I have never found any point in balancing a VW Bus tire. All my busses go 
off road at some point and if you hit a rut a curve or what not, they become 
unbalnced. I have had them balanced after they were installed and didnt 
notice any real difference.
