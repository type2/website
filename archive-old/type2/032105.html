Subject: Subject: Re:would you drive this?

My two cents:

If oil is streaming from where the transmission joins the crankcase,
sounds like the front engine seal (not the rear).

I wonder what caused your damage, in a proximal sense. If the fan came off
for some reason, it might have rammed the crankshaft around violently,
beating up the front main bearing and causing a leak at the opposite end
of the engine. In this case, I suppose once repairing the fan, the old
front seal might settle down and allow you to make your drive without
dreadful oil leakage.

OTOH if some bearing inside has gone and the fan housing
coming off was a secondary problem, then you're hosed. Or if the front
seal continues to stram oil like that for any reaon, you are hosed.

I'd say a quick drive around the block at the shop should tell you what's
up with your oil leak. If you are really fortunate and the thing now seems
to hold its oil, you might hazard the drive. If you are still streaming a
pencil thick stream of oil, you'll be empty before you can make it around
the block (in fact, you'll know before you pull away, if you look).

I'd probably bite the bullet and tow the thing home. You're probably
cruising for a bottom end rebuild. If you break down out of town
somewhere, you'll pay quite a bit in tow fees and then rent that trailer
anyways.

Good luck,
