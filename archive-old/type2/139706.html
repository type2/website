Subject: Re: [T2] hinge cover options at CIP

Chuck,

I had heard that someone was going to re-pop them....West Coast metric had 
them late last year...

http://www.westcoastmetric_dot_com/latebus.php?Section=Headliners%20and%20Interior&amp;stat=1

Your originals will probably *not* survive...they &quot;good&quot; ones I got for my 
bus from Bisted Bus several years ago were in fair shape...amazingly 
so...but I still fiberglassed them on the inside to make sure they would 
stay good for awhile.

Took lots longer to do that than buy new ones!

Cheers, dave

&gt; My originals are orange and I'm not sure they'd hold up to being  
&gt; screwed back into place.
