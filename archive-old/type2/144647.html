Subject: Fwd: [T2] 1977 westy mpg?

19.2 mpg.  Averaged last calendar year.  I also drove
it 8233 miles.  But you didn't ask that.
    
My T2 is not a westy, but instead an ASI/Riviera
conversion.  A Westfalia should be the same.  My VW
vehicle, including the engine, is a stock 78 using a
2.0 Liter Fuel Injected Federal engine with Hydraulic
Lifters and oval ported heads.  Your 77 Westy should
be about the same mileage.
  
I drive my bus hard.  Were I to baby it, my mileage
would no doubt go up.  I log every tank of gas, and
have peaked at 26 MPG when on day-trips in the flat
lands.  But I live in the mountains, and travel
downwards and back upwards into the mountains, or
drive over the mountains to the coast.  Keyword: 
Mountains.
