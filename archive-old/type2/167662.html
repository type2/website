Subject: Re: [T2] My jacks got jacked

&gt; Needless to say, the dumb-ass caused my van to shift to the side and broke
&gt; on of the jacks! The big screw just snapped.

you are lucky you were not hurt, I NEVER get under my van when lifted
unless solidly on jackstands

&gt; As I was lowering the van on one side, I BROKE THE OTHER JACK!!! WTF???? I
&gt; had just greased the damn thing up to keep it working nicely too!
&gt;
&gt; So at this point, I am without jacks that I can take with me for travel. I
&gt; have seen the updated style that BD sells, but I figured I would ask what
&gt; everyone else uses that might be compact and yet does the job?

the stock jacks are 30 years old and were POS when new.

I use a hydraulic bottle jack to carry in the van, prefer to carry the
garage jack when I am traveling anyway and usually throw a jack stand in
too, (I probably carry too much around with me)
