Hey John,
I just towed home a '69 campmobile this weekend.
Here are pics if you care to see it.....

I rented a flat bed 16' trailer to do the job.  According
to the TX Dept. of Public Safety the insurance on your
tow vehicle should cover the trailer and it's contents
in the event of an accident unless your ins. states
otherwise.  I towed the trailer with my '95 AstroVan.
The only rear wheel powered minivan.  I was really
impressed on how well it did.  If you are having
trouble finding a trailer (like I was), look in the yellow
pages under &quot;trailers&quot; instead of &quot;rentals&quot;.  The place
I found advertised as &quot;trailer sales&quot; and in small print
it said &quot;we also rent trailers&quot;.  The total cost was $50
for a weekend rental and $20 for a &quot;come along&quot; wench
from Wal-Mart.  Getting it home was the easy part.  Now
begins the hard part......
Later,
