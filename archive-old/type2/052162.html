Subject: [T2] Dumb swaybar question - thanks (bit long)

Well thanks for the informative answers on the homemade sway bars from 
electrical conduit.

I haven't hunted out the old books yet but I guess I was seeing things.

A friend reminded me that an old sports car book we both own does explain 
how to make sway bars but it requires heat treating at the end. Can't think 
of how I'd do that at home.

The basic consensus was that sway bars can be hollow but they certainly are 
not made with electrical conduit which will bend and stay bent (like it is 
supposed to...) and will really offer little resistance since it's designed 
o be bent easily and it thin walled.

I have found some cheap solutions to some expensive problems before (by 
passing the after market) and thought maybe this was one too.

As many of you noticed - and a few complained - the question was cross 
posted on about 7 lists, and I figured that each list would get it's own 
clean copy with no reference to the other lists. Just trying to use the 
computer to save some effort of actually composing each list's post.

Everyone got a copy but each got a pretty busy bunch of addresses.

I cross posted the question to get a good variety of answers since each 
list has it's 'experts'. It was a general question that applies to any car 
or truck so I didn't expect to see any complaints. I think the ones I did 
see were because folks were concerned about the many address at the top.

Thanks again everyone for all the answers!
