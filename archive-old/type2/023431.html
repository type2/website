Hiya ,,folks its friday and my .02 worth ,,i order my parts from RMMW and WW 
just like Ron does ,,nothing like his volume, but i order before i need to 
have it here when the unit hits the shop,,He is right RMMW and WW have 
recently dropped the ball on all customers including the wholesalers ,,(me 
included ,,i'm still waiting on a outter rocker for a 63 as of 3 weeks now 
),,so you must take into consideration all the points before you jump ,,they 
told me it was only a 3 day delay ,yea rite that was 2 weeks ago ,,,now you 
know why i only buy parts for the shop and don't run a parts business 
,,chewing rust ,bondo ,wire mesh,newspapers and such is all i can 
handle,,hats off to you Ron ,,you keep the migranes ,,i have enough of my own 
,,later
