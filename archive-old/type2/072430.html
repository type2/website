Subject: I finally bought a Westy!!
Content-Disposition: inline

Greetings,

I have been lurking/learning on this list for several years.  You been an
endless source of information and fun.  Thanks.  I've been looking for a
Bus for about 2 years, since the rust death of my '79 7 passenger van.  I
live in Minnesota, so rust is a major issue here.  Every bus that I found
was either a rust bucket or the owner wanted $5000 for it.  I was
starting to consider travelling to a less rusty part of the country to
purchase my &quot;dream machine&quot;, when I saw an add for a '79 VW camper
van, repairable, does not run.&quot;  I called on it, expecting it to be another
basket case.  The owner said that he was the 2nd owner, he had
purchased it from the original owner in FLORIDA!  He only owned it for 3
years and that it hasn't been started for about 1.5 years, no winters.  It
ran fine when he parked it.  Now it just won't start.  Doesn't want to tinker
with it and wants it gone.  Only rust is under the windshield.  The front
has been bumped, but it isn't bad.  Absolutely no rot around the wheel
wells or the rocker panels.  Westy interior is complete and in very nice
condition.  Has factory AC, owner said that it worked when he parked it. 
Here is the best part:  I got it for $450!!!  I know, 1979, square port heads,
very expensive.  Shouldn't have bought it without doing a compression
test.  Well, someone support me here,  assuming the worst and the
engine is shot, I still got a great deal.  Rebuild with '78 heads/exhaust, I'm
in business.  Of course, I might just charge the battery, due a tune up and
it will run fine.  Just had to tell someone who would be as interested as I
am.  Not many other people can appreciate my exitement.  Thanks for
listening.  I'll keep you posted, the flatbed arrives on Tuesday morning!!

Rob
'79 Westy  (I've been waiting a long time to add this line :)
