Subject: RE:black crud coming off my 1970's steering wheel

hello all,

perhaps this is a bit &quot;ghetto&quot;, however, has anyone
considered just wrapping the afflicted areas really
well with electrical tape. thats what i would probably
do. you probably wrap it tight enough that it  would
be barely noticable. might even look &quot;cool&quot;. just a
thought. later on-matty
