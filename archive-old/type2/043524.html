Subject: Re: re: Fuel Filler Necks Are Back!

Gentlepersons-
                      ...Since it's Friday...The British Cars list and 
Autojumble are full of re-
quests for the smog equipment - same as VW, processed from unobtainium - that 
were removed before the local laws were updated to require it again.
                      There's also a lot of &quot;junker laws&quot; floating around the 
various states...
Stuff requiring that parts car in your backyard have tags and insurance, etc. 
A few
states have &quot;buy back&quot; policies to get older cars out and the citizenry into 
the lease
cycle...
                      And, oh yeah, there's &quot;Carnivore&quot;, too. J.Edgar 
would've loved it...
Careful out there!
Tony in NJ ....home of the three/four hour inspection debacle...
