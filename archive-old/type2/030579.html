Subject: 80 Vanagon Westy - For Sale (Waaahhh!!)

Well, all good things must come to an end. A shortage of
both driveway space, time and my wife's patience have all come to 
pass at the same time. I must sell my 80 Vanagon Westy. 

This is no ordinary 80 Vanagon. It was oroginally a European
car, bought in Geneva. A divorcee bought it there, then moved
to the Canaray Islands, then back to the states. It is a legal
import, and I have all of the paperwork. Some interesting facts:

Good things:
1) It has dual carbs, factory installed. I also have all of the EPA
and Customs paperwork that states that it has a waiver from ever 
needing an emissions inspection. I passed it last year without an 
emissions inspection.

2) The engine was replaced with a factory built replacement
a couple of years before I bought it, so it has few miles
on it. (I don't have the paperwork in front of me, but it has
about 15k miles on the engine.) Hydraulic lifters. Burns about
1 pint of oil between changes. 

3) It is a full out westy with every option. Sink, stove, 
fridge, gas heater, battery charger, etc. Brown plaid interior.
Only the back seat has any tears in the fabric. The upper bunk has
never been slept in. 

4) I have rebuilt the carbs, replaced most of the gas lines, 
rebuilt the distributor, installed two new batteries.

5) All instrumentation is in Metric. (The only vanagon that goes
110! (Kph that is....))

6) It has the 'cold weather package', which was never offered in the US.
That included DOUBLE PANE tinted plexiglass windows and extra
insulation everywhere.

7) I installed a tach, oil pressure and oil temp gauge. The oil temp
gauge is not hooked up right now, but the others are. I needed the tach
because with all of the insulation you can't tell the difference between
2000 and 4000 rpm by ear.

The Bad:
1) It has some rust on the body sheet metal. It was parked near the beach
for most of it's life. But, I have installed some replacement doors
and have some more replacement metal. There is NO rust on the underside
or in any crucial spots. Mostly at the bottom of the doors and windows
and in the rain gutter. 

2) The gas gauge does not work. I pulled it and once I verified that
it was the sender, and I priced a replacement (Yikes!) I decided
to live with it. 

3) The carbs seem to leak onto the ground when not running because
it always takes about 10 seconds of cranking to fill them with
gas when starting. I don't know where they leak from, but they do.
It runs fine once started and restarts easily.

4) The sink pump does not pump. I think it is a wiring problem.

5) I have never tried the propane fridge or heater. I am too scared
of the gas heater and the fridge was too low on my priority list. 

6) I have done continuous battle with the seal on the right valve 
cover gasket, but there is still a slow leak. It is mostly
annoying because it drips into the heat echanger and causes a smell
when running the heat.

I feel bad about having to sell it, but the truth is I wanted
a van that my wife would drive. (She does not like the 
71 Bus for some reason.) But, she does not like the Vanagon either.
I also need the driveway space back and have not had the time to 
take it camping as much as I would like to. I also need to 
focus more time on the '71 Bus bodywork, because she is my baby.

I would like to offer it for $1500 or best offer. I live in the 
Washington, DC area. I am sure that it would easily be deliverable
within 100 miles or more if I can arrange a return ride. 

PS: Where else can I list it for sale to find Vanagon enthusiasts?

Chris Chubb - '71 Bus, 74 Beetle Convert, 72 Fastback, 00 Passat Wagen.
(And '80 vanagon for a little while longer)
