sounds good to me, except you should
have argon/co2 gas for mig  on steel.
straight argon is for aluminum, a pipe
dream for beginners...
the other tool you need is a 4&quot; grinder
to clean metal. prep is key to good work.

tig welding can be performed in your
sunday best, suit and tie. it's not for
the bus or the beginner.
just remember, your welding skill gets
better, the more you do.
