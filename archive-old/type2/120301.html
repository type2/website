&gt; You said:  &quot;...You can see the tool in Bentley. It's a c-shaped circular

Well, I can't disagree with you on whether it is a wise tool to use but as
Mr. Atwell says it is certainly the tool and procedure that VW recommends.

&gt; Perhaps it's been too much antacid during the 60s, but didn't somebody
&gt; on the List crack their case using that stylie tool?

Maybe if the hub had been assembled using high-strength loc-tite but it
should do the job on a stock hub/crank assembly.  I don't like the idea
and I do not do it that way.  I agree that using a 3-jaw puller is safer
and more certain although I disagree strongly with your method of using it
(read on)

&gt; Todd asked about just getting the three bolts off for the impeller -
&gt; Todd, engine in yes?  Just put the bus in gear + E-brake to hold it,
&gt; watch the wind-up and undo the three bolts!  What's the torque spec
&gt; (Bentley not handy) - like 14-18 lbs/ft or somesuch?

The torque specification for the three bolts that hold the fan to the hub
is 15 ft/lb per the Vanagon Bentley.  I could not find a spec in the
1968-79 bus Bentley but this part did not change between the bay and
vanagon.  The torque specification for the center bolt is 22 ft/lb again
per Vanagon Bentley.

&gt; Non-Rant Content: Having finally gotten wise after many years of making
&gt; vain attempts at pulling things, I've invested in some GOOD 2-jaw and
&gt; 3-jaw pullers, as well as a GOOD tie-rod &quot;popper-offer&quot; tool.

Good pullers are never cheap.  I have found over the years that pullers
without constraint on the jaws are not worth having.  The two companies
that thaat I have found that make pullers with constrained jaws are
Snap-on and Posilock.  The Posilock pullers are slightly cheaper although
not as convenient or flexible.

The Snap-on 2-jaw set can be seen at:

or

The Posilock home page is at:

&gt; The GOOD 3-jaw puller can do stuff like remove the crank gear stack on
&gt; a T4 crank, and (saints-be-praised) the impeller hub itself off of the
&gt; crank, too.  Tension it down a little on the hub, a little heat, some
&gt; well placed LFTaps from the LFHammer, some Kroil, and &quot;sproingggkkkk!&quot;
&gt; - you're done!

I have to disagree with you here, respectfully but strongly.  I would
apply Kroil and I would put the puller on and crank it until the hub pops
free. I might apply heat to the hub if I had a spare crank seal handy but
I would resist doing this.  As you said in a prior post,

  &quot;the idear of having to poke the ol' flaming propane torch down into a
  dank, and perhaps petroleum product smeared, filthy crevice for a few
  minutes JUST to get that single bolt loose???  Absolutely does NOT float
  my boat nor blow my skirt up, thanks very little :-)&quot;

But mostly I would NEVER tap on the end of the crank while the crank is
installed.  No matter how light a hammer, no matter how light a tap.
When you tap on the end of an installed crank in a Volkswagen engine what
you are really tapping on the number 1 main bearing thrust surface.  At a
minimum you would need to pull the engine and check the end play after
doing that.

                             OOK!
