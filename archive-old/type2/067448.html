Subject: VOTING (absolutely no VW content--sorry)

Now, I've kept my mouth shut while this has been appearing:

&gt;I would rather you vote against me than not vote at all.
&gt;Get out and VOTE on November 5th (USA folks that is !)

despite the DEMAND that I act in a certain way.

.....but now this has been thrust at me:

&gt;Remember to VOTE Tuesday. If you don't vote, you've got
&gt;NO right to complain about the outcome. Voters can complain for 
&gt;free!  People are fighting and dying for the rights we take for granted
&gt;EVERY DAY. I too would rather people voted against me than didn't 
&gt;vote.

wrong.

That's like saying, &quot;you can't complain about shoplifting unless you 
shoplift once in a while.&quot;  Rubbish.  We're all at the mercy of politicians 
whether we punch holes in a piece of cardboard in an elementary 
school cafeteria, or not.  I believe that the political system in this 
country is a sham, a facade held up by third grade civics classes and 
the media circus, so *I* don't vote.

I don't abstain from &quot;participating&quot; in voting because I am lazy, I'm just 
tired of the same old lies from the same old &quot;white collar&quot; criminals.
If you believe that &quot;voting&quot; for the Republocrats again is going to make 
a damn bit of difference *at* *all*, that's YOUR business, but to lambaste 
those of us who are not so deluded, is inappropriate.

I would NEVER consider ordering, telling, or even suggesting that you 
NOT VOTE--that's your personal choice.  All I ask is that you extend 
the same courtesy to the rest of us.  : )

Now lets get back to the POINT........those great air-cooled VeeDuBusses!
Sorry for using so much bandwidth, Ken.

 Rick (Fabulous)        And the politicians are throwing stones

 &quot;The Carcass&quot;           Cause its all too clear we're on our own
