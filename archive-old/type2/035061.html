Subject: Anyone have a steering box lying about?

Hey Volks,
After my escapade with the starter, I got the westy home.  Runs fine but
the steering is murder.  i was told by a friend who check out the westy
that the steering box was just over adjusted.  Well i tried to adjust
it  and got a little difference but I needed lots of umph to turn the
sucker.  My guess is that the box is shot but I'm new to this type of
thing.  I don't want to go and spend a fortune on a new one, if I am
only being bus naive.  Does anyone have a spare on a parts bus or lying
around that I could buy?  Any suggestions to what I might try to correct
the problem?  Thanks in advance!
Here's some pics of my new baby

Joy thru air,
