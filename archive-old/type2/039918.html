Subject: Re: electric fuel pump relay

I believe mine to be mounted on the left side of the fire wall but I am sure
I will need to move it when I install the BN4 heater.  As for now it is
conveniently out of the way.

&gt; Where does everyone with electric fuel pump have their relays installed?
&gt; Mine's screwed onto a piece of plywood which is then screwed through the
&gt; &quot;floor&quot; of the engine compartment, and it's right in the middle of the
&gt; way of getting the battery out. Is there a better place to put this
&gt; thing?
