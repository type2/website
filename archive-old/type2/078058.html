Subject: [T2] oil pump puller question


&gt; does anyone out there have a picture of an oil pump puller.. or know where
i
&gt; can find one on the web. i have had a stuck oil pump on my engine for like
&gt; two weeks now heehee.. i am waiting on my pump to get here anyway so it
&gt; hasn't mattered.. from what i have been told about these pullers it sounds
&gt; as if someone could fabricate one without much trouble.. i hate to order
one
&gt; and have to wait another week to put my new oil pump in while the puller
is
&gt; in shipment.
&gt; thanks
