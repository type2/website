Subject: Trailers and Vanagons

Having been raised on small block chevys, I am a relative novice to the
world of the air cooled VW.

I have an 81 Transporter in real good shape with a new clutch, but the
motor has 125K on her. It doesn't smoke, but it does use a little oil at
70MPH. :-)

Simply put, I would like to pull a pop-up type trailer with this Van. I am
not completely stupid, so I know it can't do it in its present state. :) I
also have no desire to put a V6 Porsche motor in or do anything too
radical (like a small block chevy!)

Anyone have an opinion on whether this is do-able. A new motor? Rebuild
this one? Punch it out and port it (as we say in the V8 world)? Is that an
effective method on a air-cooled motor?

Is it totally out of the question? 

Just wondering what you all might think.

TIA

Regards,

John
