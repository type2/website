As far as location of manufacture goes, I believe some ATE stuff is made 
here in the states.  Most likely some of their product line is 
manufactured elsewhere though, such as the bus wheel cylinders.  I'm not 
100% positive though.  The reason I say this is because a friend of mine 
works in a pattern shop (where they machine patterns for foundries) and 
I went up to see him one night and he was engraving the ATE logo on to a 
slab of calipers on a CNC machine.  This shop makes patterns for local 
foundries... so maybe some stuff is made in the states.

On a more bus-specific note...
I put the &quot;rebuilt&quot; engine into my 71 bus last week and have been 
driving it daily for the past few days.  Took it for a shake down cruise 
to Green Bay yesterday in some nasty winds.  Wouldn't have done it 
usually, but it was on company time, so thats ok 8-)

&gt;&gt; Now the question is, are these parts still manufactured in Germany?? I
&gt;&gt; haven't yet seen anything ATE marked Mexico or Brazil
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Not in Mexico or Brazil, but some are made in the UK.  (Same blue box.)
&gt; Also I 've been told that ATE recently merged with someone else (Continental
&gt; maybe??) so sourcing may change..
