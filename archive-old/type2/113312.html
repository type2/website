Subject: Re: [T2] Door lock spring

Hiya Jim,

I performed this exact operation on my Bus not too long ago.  At first I used springs (from Ace Hardware) which appeared to be close in size and springiness.  However, I still had some difficulty in opening the driver side door with the key.  So, I wandered on over to a helpful VW dealer.  The parts department was able to determine that the spring was still carried in VW regional inventory. I ordered a few of 'em.  If you can't find a helpful VW dealer/parts department in your area, I might be able to act as your supplier.
