it's really easy. refer to Bartnik's article &amp; procedures:
http://www.type2_dot_com/bartnik/pushrod.htm

make sure the engine is cold. the rocker arms can stay very hot
for quite some time. (AMHIK)

&amp; Kyle, drop me a note when you get to NC. there are a few bus folks in
the Chapel Hill area that i can direct you to. i live about 30 mins. away
in the Raleigh area.

&quot;Now listen.
We want to continue the concert.
We want to keep playing music.
Will you please be calm, sit down and relax so we can play music?&quot;
