&gt; &lt;&lt; I have a Coleman Inflatall 150, &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
...My '48 Craftsman bandsaw is still ticking, but I ser-
&gt; iously doubt if the current models will outlast one big project. Even
&gt; Mercedes-Benz is not immune...The M-series is rapidly approaching
&gt; Chrysler-like numbers in defects... 

It might have something to do with where they're built.

OTOH, it's fun to watch the Jeep fanatics on their newsgroup whine about the terrible things that Daimler is doing to their favorite vehicles 
now that they own it.  Jeeps weren't exactly known for their freedom from manufacturing defects!

I know what you mean about quality brands lowering their standards.  My 2-month old Bosch alternator needs replacing as the front 
(FIF) bearing is loose and clunks when you rock the pulley.  This was a brand new unit from the (Brazilian) factory.  Since this is a critical 
cooling component, it's supposed to be hell-for-stout, but this one obviously isn't.
