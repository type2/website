&gt;&gt; Earlier this year there was a thread on installing some sort of

&gt;&gt; incineration?  Priceless.  Are Vw's more prone to fire?  I think that

&gt;I was curious as to how expensive it would be to put a simple manual Halon
&gt;system into my bus, what with all this fire talk making me very very
&gt;nervous. I remember this guy I worked with who had a porsche repli-car
&gt;with a type 4 engine who had a fire suppression system in it so I emailed
&gt;him and he pointed me to http://www.ioportracing_dot_com/fire.htm

&gt;It seems they range around 400 bucks minus installation. All and all, it
&gt;doesn't seem too expensive to throw one in (especially considering I just
&gt;shelled out 600 bucks to get a new front axle beam installed).

Isaiah certainly has a turn of phrase. It actually is far cheaper the $400
if you hit an online marine supply. I remember seeing these systems for
under $100 before they outlawed Halon. I found this marine supply at
random.

manual &quot;halotron&quot; halon replacement 5lb extinguisher $129

automatic extinguisher system $189 for 75cu ft, discharges at 175 degrees,
indicator light showing operation, manual discharge option

this is almost the same but uses a less toxic extinguishing agent and only
covers 50 cu ft for $199

Maybe there's an opportunity to do a group buy for bussers in regions. This
is shipped as &quot;Hazardous material&quot; so I would expect pretty substantial
shipping fees and delays, given the current situation. It certainly would
be cool to arrange one for the Northeast for distribution at VW shows next
summer.
