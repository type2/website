Subject: Re: [T2] new windshield for 73 bus in CAlifornia?

You might be better off ordering your own parts (PPG Sunex windshield, 
about $225, and the best quality seal you can find) and having them 
installed by a mobile dood.

When I got a new windshield for my '72 a coupla years ago, some folks 
wanted $500-$600 for the windshield alone - what a rip.  Finally got it 
at Stockton Auto Glass for the $225, which is what VWTech in SoCal had 
it for, but didn't want to deal with shipping.  Stockton was the closest 
to me at that time.

Ask for the PPG Sunex - if they don't know what you're talking about, 
run away.

Where in CA are you?

Teri
