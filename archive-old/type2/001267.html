Subject: '70 Tranny Mount Needed
Date: Wed, 23 Aug 2000 12:17:38 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

    I'm trying to locate a new front tranny mount for a '70 Sportsmobile.
Called Bus Depot and they said they had no listing for any tranny mount from
'68-'79.  Checked the website and found nothing either. I gave my local VW
shop (LA Products) a call and they tried a couple of there supliers and got
the same story.  Couldn't find a listing in Rocky Mountain either.  Am I SOL
here or what?
    My mount isn't broken, but it's bent up a little.  So much that the
shift rod doesn't fit properly and gear selection is a real pain.  Thanks a
lot for the help...

See you down the road,
