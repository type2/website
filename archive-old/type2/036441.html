Subject: Re: or why we do what we do

With the current &quot;c'mon lets all be nice and help out.....&quot; thread running I
thought I might throw away my two cents.

Everyone seems confused as to why there is a general mistrust and reluctance
to get involved, but personally I think it is justified.

Years ago when I was in the Marine Corps I did a lot of driving. I was
stationed in southern Cali and my family was in Phx. I drove back and forth
at least once a month and I was almost always alone.

In those days I was always pulling over to help someone or picking up
hitchhikers. Unfortunately the majority of the time my attempts to help
others turned into a very bad experiences and at times down right dangerous.
The world has changed and the highways have become a dangerous place.

I now live in a small town in Montana. We don't lock our doors, we leave our
keys in our car, and we don't fear for our children when they are outside.
However, when I travel I no longer jump at the chance to help what &quot;appears&quot;
to be a stranded motorist and I never pick-up hitchhikers.

I had three situations they could have been really ugly, but I was lucky. I
don't think I'll push my luck.
