&gt;Hi John,
&gt;
&gt;I forgot to tell you in the email.  A shop sold me what they identified as a 75
&gt;1800.  The engine serial # prefix of GD identified it as a 2.0L, Lucky me.  If
&gt;the prefix on the 75 is an AW or ED, it is an 1800.  GD and GEs are 2.0L.  If
&gt;you have the computer which came with the engine, it should work.  In my humble
&gt;opinion, since the computer senses basically mass air flow, head temp, and
&gt;ambient air temp, I submit the computer will properly adjust to a proper
&gt;mixture. 

I'll go a step farther and say that motors with a mass-air sensor will adjust to displacement as well.  The only problem you will run into is that with a larger displacement, you could run past the operating range of the mass-air meter and/or computer at very high RPM.  The L-Jetronic is mass-air (L for luft (air), right?) and the D-Jetronic is MAP (d=drueck (pressure), uses manifold vacuum to meter fuel).  Any bus with L-Jetronic should adjust very well to displacement changes, while those with D-Jetronic would run lean with a larger than stock displacement.  I can never remember which years came with which system.
