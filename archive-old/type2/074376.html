Subject: Subject: AFM Tuning - Another Take

&gt; Subject: AFM Tuning - Another Take
&gt; Message-ID: &lt;3C41D771.B24BE2D2_at_csulb_dot_edu&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; So, we've all been fooling with our AFMs by adjusting the spring tension
&gt; to ultimately fix a rich or lean mixture.  It seems like the right thing
&gt; to do for obvious reasons which most of us know by now.  But, I think
&gt; there are side-effects to changing the spring tension which I haven't
&gt; seen discussed.
&gt; 
&gt; My reasoning for this is as follows: When my AFM spring was tighted to
&gt; compensate for a rich mixture, it leaned out my engine, but it also
&gt; caused some strange behaviour.  When I'd be cruising at a constant
&gt; speed, let's say around 40-45 in 3rd, going slightly uphill so it wasn't
&gt; accelerating, I'd notice that there would be a slight stutter.  I'd
&gt; describe it as a wah wah wah wah.. speeding up and slowing down.. within
&gt; probably a 10-20 rpm range at about a 2hz rate.  Very slight, but
&gt; noticeable.  So, I pull over and I loosened the spring tension almost
&gt; back to the original setting and there is even less of an oscillation.
&gt; 
&gt; (physics people please correct me if below sounds incorrect):
&gt; 
&gt; Here's my take on what's happening:  I think that the AFM spring is
&gt; tuned for a specific tension to avoid oscillations at all airflows.  If
&gt; the spring is too tight, the car bucks strangly because you press the
&gt; gas, the flap opens, but then, do to the inherent property of being a
&gt; spring, it springs back and closes a bit, but closes too much, so it
&gt; opens again, and then closes... kinda like it finds a resonant frequency
&gt; and gets caught there.  I would also venture to guess that the
&gt; performance would be mushy if the spring would be too loose, but I
&gt; haven't actually tried it...
&gt; 
&gt; Earlier, I was thinking, let's say I adjust he wiper arm but don't
&gt; change the spring tension.  Will the flap deflect the same amount at a
&gt; given RPM range for two different wiper arm settings (which would
&gt; obviously cause different mixtures)?  I am guessing YES.  I think that
&gt; the engine always wants to pull the same amount of air for a given rpm
&gt; range regardless of fuel consuption.  For that reason, the spring
&gt; tension is calibrated to the amount of airflow, not to the amount of
&gt; fuel needed.  Yes, changing the spring tensions will in-fact change the
&gt; mixture, but it will also put the flap at the incorrect tension and
&gt; cause stuttering side-effects.
&gt; 
&gt; For this reason, I think that the spring is not the right thing to mess
&gt; with if you're trying to change the fuel mixture, but instead the wiper
&gt; adjustment or the screw on top of the AFM.  However, changing the wiper
&gt; settings does have its side-effects, namely the fuel-pump shutoff arm,
&gt; so this would need to be checked after adjustments to make sure it still
&gt; performs as intended.
&gt; 
&gt; What do you guys think about this theory?
&gt; 
&gt; Mike



at altitude, the density of the air has changed. A given volume of air
flowing
through the meter has less mass than at sea level.

This air has a velocity, and when it impinges on the valve, it will
create 
some force proportional to the mass and velocity.
 
If the mass goes down for a given volume of air, the force goes down on
the
AFM flapper.

Shifting the wiper arm only shifts the fuel map. You will end up with
perhaps
the correct mixture at *one* point, but you will still be feeding the
computer
incorrect data about the mass of air flowing into the engine.
 
The air bleed screw has a similar effect as shifting the wiper position.
Its
just way to offset how much air can go unmetered by the computer.
 
 
If you think your flap is freely resonating, ask yourself what stops it
from fluttering at any given spring tension. There is no device to damp
the movements, other than the airflow itself. It's highly unlikely that
adjusting the spring tension will cause any issues with resonance.
 
 
Now, what you may have is a lean fuel map. After adjusting the spring
tension, you may
find it helpful to adjust the wiper position to shift the entire fuel
map a little richer
or leaner. 
 
If you simplify the system to look linear, the relation between position
of the flow meter
and the fuel sent to the engine could be the &quot;classic&quot; y= mx + b
 
Y= amount of fuel sent to the engine
M= volume of air going to the engine
X= spring tension
B= offset caused by either wiper position or air bleed.

 
hopefully this isn't too muddled...
