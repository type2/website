&gt; Hey all,
&gt;   I found that this so called &quot;heavy duty&quot; stand flexes a
&gt; lot with a
&gt; stripped type 4 short block, I bet it won't like a full
&gt; dress Bus engine. 

I don't know the specifics of your bench mount stand, but it sounds just
like mine.  Mine did handle a fully dressed 1974 1800 Type IV engine, heat
exchangers, muffler and all.  I don't say that it didn't scare the poop
outta me though.  It flexed like a sonofagun, and acutally deformed the
two fork arms a bit.  But it survived to hold my next rebuild project (a
1600 DP) without breaking.
