Gentlepersons-
                       ...What with the increased penalties and enforcement 
of DWI's, even if
it's legal to have open containers in the back of your van, most law 
enforcement offi-
ers are probably going to take a dim view of it. If you're stopped, for 
whatever reason,
 you compound the chances of a ticket by adding drinking into the mix. My 
buddy, who
is a cop, thought if he happened to stop a vehicle with a &quot;party&quot; going on in 
the back-
RV, van, whatever- it would be probable cause to test the driver, just in 
case. He ex-
plained that &quot;if&quot; something happened further down the road, he'd have to 
answer why
he didn't catch it earlier. Nothing personal, he said, but it's his a** too.
