Subject: Re: [T2] I could use some suggestions

Hi Nate,

Let's stick with the stuff you touched. I think it should be safe to  
assume that if you didn't touch it then it isn't broken.

A couple quick items to check:
- Maybe one of the fuel lines is kinked and blocking the fuel flow?
- If it's an electric fuel pump, then make sure that the connections  
are both in place, and that the polarity is correct.t

If you did any work inside the engine compartment then that could be  
a culprit: check first for power at the coil, then for spark, then  
for vacuum leaks, etc.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
