&gt; ... Where is the oil coming from that blows up the rear hatch?  (not out
of the exhaust, I have checked)...

I'm experiencing this, too; and going through some oil.  It looks like it's
the front seal on our's, but I'm not entirely sure.  I can't find any other
place where it's leaking.

We were going to have the local guru look at it anyway, to give it a good
once over since I've been out of the loop bus-wise for 20+ years.  He'll fix
the leak and give the whole engine a once-over when it's pulled.  He's
back-logged at present, so I'm carrying extra oil until the appointment
comes up end of next month.

Meanwhile, tailgaters tend to stay back a comfortable distance. :O)
