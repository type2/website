&gt; &gt; I saw this picture too and really liked it. In case
&gt; 
&gt; We happened across this family scene on a stroll around the camp. I was
&gt; upset I didnt have my cam with me, Im glad someone did.


We [the Canadians] were standing across the path,, keeping an eye on Dolan...
even Kenny was watching!
