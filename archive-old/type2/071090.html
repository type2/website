X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

&lt;&lt;  Anybody familiar with the process to &quot;raise&quot; effaced serial numbers from a
&gt; body part (chassis, say)? Heat, machinist's ink?? I know law enforcement
&gt; bodies do this regularly, but I'm not aware of the process.

Are you trying to transfer the numbers to a sheet of paper? You could just
make a rubbing--lay a sheet of paper over the serial number and rub over it
with a crayon/pencil/colored chalk. &gt;&gt;

No, not trying to do a &quot;grave rubbing&quot;. Trying to read the numbers on a
chassis that has either been ground down or rusted so the original num-
bers can't be read. Like I said, I'm sure the FBI boys can get a serial #
from a gun, but I'm not sure how.
