Subject: Re: [T2] Chemicals ok to use on fiberglass

I tried a variety of products for this.  Grime away, simple green etc.  Only
thing that worked was bleach and water in a spray bottle.  That fuzzy stuff
is unaffected (won't discolor), and there seems to be no harm to the
fiberglass itself.  Rinse well.  Worked like a charm for me.  Good luck, Nik
