James,

There should be a &quot;brake proportioner&quot; under the bus in the brake line that 
goes to the rear wheels.  It was added to the bus along with front disk 
brakes and its job is to even the braking between front and rear brake 
circuits.  When you brake hard, it has a check ball of some sort that slides 
forward. My Fox wagon has one that even adjusts to the weight load in the car!

It could be this gizmo is stuck or not doing its job correctly.

I know very little about its function, other than when it is out of the bus 
and in hand you can hear the little valve click back and forth when you shake 
it.

Anybody???  Can these things go bad and behave in this way?
