&gt;&gt;  My wife INSISTS that we buy a brand new Brazilian Volkswagen Bus. I told
&gt;&gt;  her I didn't think it was possible because they don't meet US 
&gt;&gt;safety and crash
&gt;  &gt; test ratings.  Is there ANY to buy one and bring it over to the states?


1.  If, as I hear, even the Brazilians have been so stupid as to 
cease mfr of the air-cooled bus, you certainly don't want a new one.

2.   Watch out whether the used air-cooled one you buy in Brazil is 
an alcohol model  -  no doubt will go well, but difficult to fuel in 
the USA as nearly all of those billions of dollars annually 
subsidising ADM (51g/gall) end up in E10 not E100 or E85. 
Practically, best to make sure you get petrol motor  -  this will 
also ensure the vehicle can be refuelled as it's driven up thru 
Panama, Mexico, etc

3.  It may have enough ground clearance so that, even when packed 
with wetbacks to make the whole caper economic, you'll be 'wading 
that river'  -  I gather the Rio Grande is very shallow in some 
stretches.  Don't let the infra-red detection, machine guns, etc 
worry you.
