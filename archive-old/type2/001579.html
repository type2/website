I'm wondering what problems to expect.

You should expect that the left side will rust out, too, unless you buy an
acid neutralizing pad to put under the battery.  My 71 is COMPLETELY rusted
out on both sides, and I'm in the process of putting new metal in.

But here's a question for the old hands:  do the new sealed batteries
leak/splash like the old ones?  If so, and protection is still called for,
what's the best shield.  Believe me, I never want to hassle with this again,
for the little bit of trouble the proper liner would be.
