&gt; I checked the posts but to no avail. I have a '79 standard consisting of a

&gt; some investigating and found too many answers. Could someone refer me to the
&gt; correct names of these colors?
&gt; 
&gt; My driver's side window crank won't stay on the post because it is severely
&gt; stripped. Is there an easy fix or do I need a new regulator?
Flx870:
I'm not up on paint names and numbers, but I do have an opinion on the
window winder: It's probably the handle if you can see that it's
stripped. Bus Depot has nice Brazillian black ones for $1.99 each. You
car probably has brown ones, if you care, try you local dealer or a
salvage yard. When installing, put a small drop of loctite on the screw.
