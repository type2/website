Subject: Re: [T2] VW powered air compressor

Hi Andy,

I saw one of those on a trailer at EveryBus a few years back. They  
are very nifty items if you need a LOT of air, but one thing no-one  
has mentioned yet is that THEY ARE VERY, VERY LOUD.

Happy trails,

&gt; I recall a compressor kit that consisted of a type 1 engine with a

&gt; two made up the compressor. Anybody have any links/info?
