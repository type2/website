A bus that a friend of mine owned did this.  The pulsing was 
inconsistent, but VERY noticable when it happened.  Turned out that the 
lining on one of the rear brake shoes had freed itself from the shoe.
Most of the lining anyways, not all, as we would have heard a grinding 
if all of it had freed itself.  When braking, it (the broke away lining) 
would sometimes get caught between the shoe and the drum and throw 
itself around in there.
Pull your rear drums, check it out.  Just another possibility...

&gt; When applying the brakes the pedal is pulsing. Typically this would be 
&gt; indicative of warped disk rotors. However in the case the pulsing is not 
&gt; consistent.
