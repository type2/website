Subject: Re: LPG powered air-cooled VWs

For those interested in LPG, (which i'm definately not):
The Dutch Nissan forklift truck importer can supply new
fork lift trucks with an LPG system. The systems they use are
directly imported from California, i can't remember the brand.
These are very high quality systems. My pickup had an LPG system
in it when i bought it. I removed it. i don't need two tanks,
two induction systems two sets of fuel lines, a hotter engine,
LPG lines to/through my muffler, holes in the body of my VW, 
a mess in the engine compartment, to be restricted from using 
parking garages, or more weight. My registration papers told me
my car weighed 1312Kg with LPG system and 1168Kg without it.

I don't think that LPG is better for our environment at all, i
recall having seen some comparison tests...

For years it was known that a certain engine on LPG had lower Hp
and ran hotter on LPG than on gasoline. I've heard about newer 
systems that would equal the performance of the stock fuel system
but i dono how that is achieved, maybe those systems even require 
different CRs and/or modified combustion chambers, i don't know. 
Most problems i experienced with LPG powered cars were cold weather 
starting problems and a lot refuse to run on gasoline after a
while because of dried out fuel lines, gaskets, fuelpump, etc.

If i would *have* to use LPG i would use two dual throat throttle 
bodies from an aftermarket FI system (or 4 Solex butterfly plates
of a carbureted T IV on a pair of dual carb manifolds) and mount 
an LPG venturi/nozzle above each butterfly and remove the gasoline 
system alltogether. I would simply mount the system as VW would have, 
the LPG tank where the old tank was, the filler tube in place of the 
old fillertube, the LPG lines in place of the old fuel lines, etc. 
as to have as little new holes as possible and to keep the weight 
down.

Brian.
