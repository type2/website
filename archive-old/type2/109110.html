Subject: Re: [T2] Re: inverter

&gt; I was maily looking for the specs. I want to put one in my bus with a little
 more umpf than stock, just a little.

Not sure why you want more umpf......
All it does is convert 120V AC to 12V DC to run the fridge and charge the aux battery when you connect to a
land line. The 120V outlets only are hot when you connect to a land line. It does NOT invert 12V DC up to 120V
AC.
