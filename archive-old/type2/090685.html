Subject: Ugly extinguisher zits bus friday

list,
Well, that was a hell of a friday, eh?

Thanks to all who posted on the extinguisher thing.
I don't think there is one that will fit right in the
old clip - but hey -if there's one thing i guess i
don't want to be 'vintage' in my bus, its a safety
device. A small Kidde unit ( or two) will probably be
what i use.
My fuel lines are new and clamped.

I compliled all of the recent bus-related zits comics
on one page.

I'll let you know if i get any flak about it.

Finally - the uglybus thread has been a hoot.
I really think i'm in the running with my expanding
foam-filled quarters and enameled rust spots:

I did change the door back to the original.
BTW, this bus was originally red. The engine
compartment still is.

I love it like a scraggly old dog.

thanks volks,
clark
