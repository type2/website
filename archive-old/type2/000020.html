The problems you had with the clutch days before could very well have been 
signs of the coming event.  You really only have 3 major causes for clutch 
failure and two of them are detectable with the motor in.  First crawl under 
and look at the tranny. on the driver side of the tranny you will see an arm 
or lever.  look for a cable there or have someone raise and lower the pedal 
to detect breakage.  The next step can be done in the same position as well, 
is the arm moving?  Is it there....  Break out the book if the cable is still 
hooked up which I doubt,,,  and follow instructions for adjustment.  
Hopefully you can stop there. If not hop on the PC and let us know what ya 
saw.
Peace Out
Rick
