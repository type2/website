&lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt; Symptoms:
&gt; a. Starts normally and runs for around 3 seconds.
&gt; b. While running, it sounds normal.
&gt; c. No unusual sounds when it dies.
&gt; d. I can usually restart right away several times in
&gt; a row.
&gt; e. Sometimes, if I give it just the right amount of
&gt; gas, I can keep  
&gt; it running - managed to do this for a whole minute.
&gt; f. The AFM connector is 7 pin style; if I disconnect
&gt; it, engine will  
&gt; start and run at idle indefinitely.

**Item (f) has me confused 


&gt; I guess that leaves Cold Start Valve, Thermo-Time
&gt; Switch and Aux Air  
&gt; Regulator.

**Not a factor
 
 Also, is there a way to connect a Remote  
&gt; Starter Switch on an FI system? I tried both of the
&gt; small pins on the  
&gt; solenoid and both resulted only in turning on the
&gt; Fuel Pump?!? 

**See my pictures at the end of my techpix2 album
(addy below) I suspect you have your fuel pump
connection on the starter switch connector.

Check your double relays connections. It seems to be
in this circuit - the fuel pump runs off the solenoid
when key is in start position / starter operating.
Fuel pump builds pressure in fuel line and the engine
runs off that pressurized fuel after starter is
disengaged until pressure runs out. I can't figure how
the engine keeps running indefinitely with the AFM
disconnected tho - that is what engages the double
relay to power the fuel pump while there is airflow
into engine. Maybe a screwed up ground at the double
relay? That brown wire that connects to one of the
sheetmetal screws holding the relays / resistor pack
often comes loose. There have been issues posted
recently about the double relay large plastic
multi-wire &quot;plugs&quot; with loose individual wire / socket
within.
Concentrate your efforts in this area. -BaH
