Subject: [WetWesties] Help! Need VW diesel shop in San Francisco

I'll start with the need: I need to find a VW diesel shop in SF, or someone
that has tools and space I can use to repair my diesel Vanagon.
And, now, the &quot;rest of the story&quot; (Keep in mind this van has a 1.9NA VW
*diesel* engine)

After several years of reliable operation, the SlugBus had some problems
today. As we left San Francisco, headed North on HWY 1, the oil pressure
light came on. We coasted to the bottom of the hill, and immediately shut
off the engine. When the oil pressure light came on, we also lost vacuum
assist. That screams to me the intermediate shaft is not rotating. After
trying to avoid that reality, and checking alternator and water pump, I
proceeded with troubleshooting: I pulled the timing belt cover, and had my
wife turn over the car to verify no shaft rotation. The timing belt is still
fine, and did not jump any teeth. But, the belt is not turning the
intermediate shaft pulley. ;-( That means no vacuum...and no oil pressure.

I have none of my diesel tools with me. So, can someone recommend a good VW
diesel shop in San Francisco? Our van is parked in The Presidio. I am trying
to get home to Albany, OR.

Thank you,

Jon....Stranded in San Francisco with my 1983 Diesel Vanagon...the &quot;Slugbus&quot;
