Subject: brake stuff. I dont know what im talking about....

Hello listmembers...

I dropped my 76 westy off down the road at Midas to get an idea of
what needs to be repaired on the rear brakes.=20

They said to me that the right rear Cylinder is leaking and needs to be =
replaced, that I should just do the left also while im at it. The top of =
the rotor is wore down, but they can resurface them. (is it odd that the =
top of the rotors wore down way further than the bottom? does that even =
make sense?)

There are 4 shoes in the back alone, and all need to be replaced.=20

They also said that my front right hub bearings are loose, and there is =
a bunch of stuff that would need to be done to correct that.=20

Now that I know what they think needs to be done, I can either take it =
someplace else and get another opinion as well as hopefully a bit of a =
better price (they said everything would run around $340) - or try and =
do this stuff myself. I am a little hesitant to do brake work myself, =
mostly cuz if there is one system I would really rather not mess up, its =
the one that helps me stop. =3D)


thanks for any tips, info, or suggestions...
