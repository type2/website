Does any one know if K&amp;N airfilters will add any ooomph to
 the Vanagon. The owner of Veeparts says it will give a
 bit more get up and go in the midrange.

Rob:

You won't get much of an improvement in power or mileage. The idea is that K
&amp; N filters flow a little better than stock. One nice feature is that they
can be cleaned and reused.

Thank You!
