Subject: Re: [T2] re Bob Hoover's Sermons 

I have no intention of picking at any of the stuff that has scabbed over
now, but this is really wrong:

&gt; I'll be right behind him,  never got your CD cuz I use Linux and it
&gt; wouldn't run on my machine...but if it is ever ported to something generic
&gt; like PDF or html I'll take one.....

The CD *was* PDF specifically because the only way to do it which would run
on (and be searchable in) Linux, MacOS and Windoze, it was distributed in
hybrid HFS/ISO9660 format so all three platforms could read it, and
furthermore it included Acrobat Reader installers for all three platforms.

Surely I have many sins to answer for and I will probably end up in Hell but
it won't be because I am not scrupulous WRT cross-platform issues. =^ )

Encrusted with inclusiveness,

Happy Friday,

--Hoop

Ps, no I am not sending anybody anything &quot;off the record&quot; so don't ask me.
