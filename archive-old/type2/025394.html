I'll pitch in my two cents here, just to stir the nest a bit.

I just bought a 1973 passenger bus after looking for a little over a year. I
have little intention of doing much of the maintence myself. I don't have
the time, the patience or the attention to detail it requires. Moreover, Mr.
Tang is not intended simply as transportation. We intend to fully restore
him.

Every 3000 miles the bus will go into the shop to have the oil changed, the
valves adjusted and the mechanic look it over to make sure everything is
working as it should. When something mechanical needs fixing, the mechanic
will fix it.

Last weekend we (the whole family, there's four of us including a 5 and 9
year old) got out there and cleaned the bus. It is a new purchase and it was
pretty filthy. We spent a whole day together as a family working on a
project that we are now all proud of. All for the cost of materials to clean
it. Cheap at twice the price!

Eventually, we'll have a daily driver that can make a decent showing in the
car shows. We looking forward to that. We don't really care if we win. We
just like to enter and have everyone admire our bus.

Everyone has different desires and objectives. Each person needs to decide
what their's are. We did a lot of research before we jumped in. We had a
fair idea of what we were getting into. There have already been some
surprised and I'm sure there will be more. But we're having a lot of fun. I
think that's most important thing. Have fun with it. Enjoy it. Life's too
short to drive boring cars.
