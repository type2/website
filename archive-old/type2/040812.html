Subject: FS: Westy in New England

1980 vanagon Westy for sale in southern Maine (portland to be exact). Spent 
90%
of it's life in New Mexico, then moved to Virginia, and finaly to Maine about 
a
year ago. 2 beds, sink, ice box. Seats and beds were recovered about a year 
ago
and look nice. Light blue exterior. Beige interior. Factory gas heater. This
camper needs some work, but has had much done already and should be an easy
project. Selling only because I am losing my parking space. Feel free to email
me about the details of what it needs and what it's already had done. $1000  
Please dont post to list, contact me personally Thanks,.
