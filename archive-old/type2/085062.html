Subject: RE: [T2] Swing Lever Bushing Lifespan - (Tap, Tap - Is This Thing
	 On???)

	David:

	You're a saint!  That's exactly the kind of input I was looking
for...

	I was really curious if I got a bad batch of QC, the lube schedule
was insufficient, the MBZ alloys done them in, my 914 influenced driving
style (on a Westy, yeah, right), or the 10 miles of an &quot;alleged&quot; dirt road
while gold prospecting in Michoacan had something to do with their demise.

	The rest of you - come on, don't be shy ;-)  You know who you are...

	Jim H.

&gt; &gt;         I know that some of you long term Bay Pilots, somewhere, have
&gt; &gt;replaced the swing lever bushings, AND have SOMETHING to report on their
&gt; &gt;lifespan.  Can you do that for a fellow bus-drivin' fool?
&gt; 
&gt; Okay, okay.  :-)  I replaced the bushing myself a long time ago - it's a 
&gt; job I never want to do again.  The steering was oh-so-tight and wonderful 
&gt; for about... six months after which time I detected play in the bushing 
&gt; again.  It has remained somewhat loose ever since, although it is still
&gt; way 
&gt; better than the old bushing ever was and doesn't seem to be getting much 
&gt; worse.  I'm not sure if I didn't install it right or what, but I was very 
&gt; disappointed at how fast it &quot;wore in&quot;.  If you got 41,000 miles out of 
&gt; yours, you did better than me.
