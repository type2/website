&gt; Even easier than what you suggest would be to short
&gt; pins 36 and 39 in the AFM connector of the FI
&gt; harness.
&gt; 

I haven't had the guts to try to disconnect any plugs
(AFM or ECU). Is there anything special you need to do
to get them off? I've tried to pull very weakly on the
AFM plug, but it wouldn't come off. don't fix what
ain't broken...
