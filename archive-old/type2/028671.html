It is about time to replace the exhaust on my '72, current setup is getting
quite rusty and thin in places.  My current system is a 2pc extractor system
(can't see any name/part #'s to identify brand) that mounts the muffler in a
downward facing position and leaves very little in the way of ground
clearance (maybe 4-5&quot; at best).  This hangs up on some speed bumps, and has
prevented me from acessing some great camp sites on roads that are not
actually all that rough, but that have deeply worn tire tracks that leave a
mound in the middle that I can't clear.
My question is what type of exhaust setup will offer the most ground
clearance and still function well?  I have been looking at the stock system
and also the Pacesetter one piece.  I would prefer to go with the stainless
steel stock setup, as I know the fit and workmanship will be much better,
but don't want to wind up tearing it off on my first camping trip if the el
cheapo Pacesetter will allow more clearance.  If anyone knows for sure which
has more clearance, please let me know.

Thanks,
Jay Brown
