Subject: Re: [T2] &quot;can't find the title&quot; in california

I find that doing DMV stuff through my AAA office is a lot less 
stressful than waiting in line at the DMV office, also you get get 
better information. Making an appointment instead of walking in at 
the DMV is not too bad though.

As Trinh says getting a bill of sale will help a lot.

&gt;Alot of states that i know, do not require a Title for cars over 25 yrs
&gt;old. Including my state (Georgia). They claim this will reduce the
&gt;paper work. All you need is a registration at the DMV. If you wanna
&gt;be safe, have it notarize with the seller signature in the back of the
&gt;registration. Best thing to do is call up your local DMV and ask
&gt;what is required.


&gt;&gt;listees! i am considering buying a bay where the owner can't find the title
&gt;&gt;and never filed for a replacement. owner and bus are in california. is
&gt;&gt;there a way around this, like a duplicate title that can be picked up in
&gt;&gt;one day at the dmv? i am trying to prevent a case of the sketchies, and
&gt;&gt;being able to get a clean slip in oregon as easily as usual. is going
&gt;&gt;through sacto essential? any ideas on a process that has worked are
&gt;&gt;welcome. thanks,
&gt;&gt;steve
