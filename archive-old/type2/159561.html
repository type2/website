Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] Fw: 1978 bus Air flow meter problem?

Mike S., Normally the air flow meter air measuring vane should indeed 
keep the pump running after the starter switch is released and engine 
has caught.  More accurate and easier (than yanking the air filter and 
swticking a pencil against the vane would be to jump 36 and 39 contacts 
in the AFM plug. However, it is possible the switch contact is faulty (a 
backfire could cause this) and note that the fuel pump gets the power 
from the double relay (being switched by the AMF contact or the starter 
switch).  The double relay may have faulty contacts.  When I had the 
problem of the fuel pump not working when it got hot, it was simpler to 
lie under there with my jumper wire from the pump positive and touch it 
to the direct feed from the batter and &quot;listen&quot; for the pump -and if it 
does whirr, verify pressure by someone watching the gauge I hooked to 
the fuel ring.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Disconnect the double relay, and fuel pump wires. run a &quot;temp&quot; wire from
the battery to the fuel pump, and hook a ground up to the other side,
respecting the polarity + and -, check fuel pressure at the rail, should be
30-40psi.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just so you know, it's much easier to just pull off the air filter and 
push a screwdriver and open the flapper.  Or, if you've already pulled 
off the cover from the AFM, just actuate the fuel switch in there.
