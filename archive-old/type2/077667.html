Subject: Re: [T2] Westy Interior Panel Patterns

On the sliding door and rear hatch, the panels are fastened with chrome
headed snap fasteners, sorta like those used on regular door trim panels,
but in this case the fastener heads are exposed.  The holes for these
fasteners are located with a fair degree of precision, and I have
incorporated these holes into the patterns I have drawn.  I think the holes
in the sliding door and rear hatch frames are VW factory holes and are used
by the trim panel fasteners in regular (non-Westy) buses.

As for the rest of the plywood panels, I have a definite sense that there
was a low degree of precision used in locating the fastening screws/holes.
I think the assembly method used by the Westfalia factory was to hold the
panel in place, drill the hole in &quot;about the right place&quot;, and put a screw
or pop rivet in.  So I would not expect there to be an exact match for the
hole locations from one bus to the next.  My advice is to either not show
these holes, or at least include a note to the effect of what I have said
above.

The issue regarding available plywood material sizes has been with us for a
while, but it's good to know there is a source for oversized sheets.  Anyone
have contact info on Harbor Sales?

Another option I have considered is to join pieces of 1/8&quot; ply to make the
larger pieces required.  This could be done by jointing (using a jointer
plane or motorized jointer) the edges to be joined and then backing the
joint with a strip of 1/8&quot; ply, 1&quot; wide or so.  The backing strip would have
to be held back in some areas where it would interfere with the underlying
structure of the bus.

I just remade all the interior wall panels on my '72 Westy Poptop.  Used =
a simple 1/8 inch ply (mahogany.)   Looks great with the Redwood stain =
(sorry, no pics yet.) =20
I reused the original ceiling panels.  Just sanded off all that ... uh =
... white wash looking stuff that they covered it with.  Nice wood =
underneath.  Stained it, etc.
I hit 2 problems on the way.
1- The ceiling panels are just over 4 feet wide and a standard sheet of =
ply wood is 4 feet wide exactly.  How is this a problem, you ask?  Well, =
the grain on the sheet of ply runs length wise (8 foot) and the grain =
for the ceiling must run front to back in order to bend the piece into =
place.  Ever try to bend wood against the grain?  Yes, it can be done =
but it is a p.i.t.a.  So you can't cut the 2 large ceiling panels out of =
a standard piece of ply due to the grain.  I suppose you could special =
order the wood, but who knows.  I'm sure someone here will have some =
great solution.
2- Not a great problem but appropriate to the AutoCad program/ pattern =
thread.
The panels are screwed to the side of the bus (not the door panels, of =
course.)  The holes must be drilled in precisely the correct location.  =
Not such a big deal with the smaller pieces, but with the larger one =
behind the driver you can't see to line up the holes.  My holes were =
drilled correctly and I still had a little trouble.  So when making the =
pattern, take careful measurements for those screws.
Then again, you could just try drilling NEW holes into the metal walls.  =
Not something I would want to do though.
Just my 2 cents.

Good luck.  This pattern would be great for the library.

If we were to make patterns we would have to show the holes and the spacing
for them. That is why I was saying it would be best for someone to test the
drawings before they are released to the community. The last thing I want is
a thread about &quot;those poor drawings for wood paneling&quot; next year!

I am not sure what a person would do about the grain and size issue.

Thanks for the 2 cents!!!  All the comments and suggestions are welcome. The
more input the better the product should be.

5-8 foot wide plywood is avaliable from specialty providers, it is much
more expensive but for one or two pieces it should not be
burdensome. (were talking $25-30 instead of $ 4-5 for 1/8 inch thick)

I have gotten it from a company called &quot;Harbor Sales&quot; but they only
ship/deliver to the Mid Atlantic region
