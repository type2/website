Replacing the coldstart injector is not a big thing.  Yes, you
have to pull the dizzy, but what I do is get an awl and lightly
scribe a mark on the dizzy and the clamp.  Replace the cold start
valve. When you put the dizzy back in, you just realign the scribe
marks and you sould be almost dead on.  

One thing to do to test it though, is to get the engine good and 
hot and then, with a piece of metal tubing, just plumb around the 
cold start valve.  If you run fine after, then your valve is shot.
If it runs the same, something else is it.  Make sure you don't 
ignore the head temp sensor too.  If it reads too high a resistence,
then you'll run to rich also.  When they're BOTH bad, well, I had
it happen and it WASN'T fun!!

Good luck.

&gt; I'm having the same problem with my FI, and after pouring over Bentley 
&gt; and testing just about everything else, I'm pretty sure that it's the 
&gt; Cold Start valve, which is essentially a 5th inject that should only work 
&gt; for about 8 seconds.  The tell-tale symptom in my mind is the fact that 
&gt; if it stalls while warm, I cannot get it started again without letting it 
&gt; sit for 5 minutes.  Another symptom I have in addition to rich and high 
&gt; idle is poor gas milage (around 13 mpg).  The other common mistake 
&gt; Bentley identifies for these symptoms is switiching wires 30 and 50 (they 
&gt; hook to the solenoid and starter).  I haven't check that either.  I'll 
&gt; let you know what I find with the cold start valve - I've been holding 
&gt; off because the bottom screw is almost impossible to get to without 
&gt; pulling the distributor, and I don't want to do that.
