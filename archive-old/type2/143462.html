&gt; If I use a 3/4&quot; or 1&quot; impact I have to use bigger daiameter hose to be
&gt; sure to get the most air pressure I can at the end of it---
&gt; 
&gt; The larger impacts require big volume, big pressure to get the job done.
&gt; They require full time 150 psi at the end of the hose.  
&gt; 
&gt; 

Hey guys  I have 1 inch lines running in my shop and also have the compressor 
set at 140psi  the other thing is using the largest connectors at the air 
tool itself.  these connectors come in about 3 or 4 different sizes ,  it is best 
to use the largest  later  mark dearing
