Subject: need tach with alarm (girlfriend abuse)
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com


hi all. here's a problem i'm sure many of you have
encountered: my girlfriend and i bought a '77 westy
together. it runs well, but i'm afraid it won't run well
for long the way she drives it. no matter how many times i
scold her for overrevving the motor, she simply cannot pay
attention to the rpms. she frequently pushes 60 in third
gear. i can keep a watch on her when we're both in the car,
but who knows what evils she perpetrates on our poor bus
when i'm not around. the only solution i can think of is to
install a tach that sounds an alarm when the rpms get above
a certain level. i think an annoying screech every time the
motor is overrevving would probably cure her bad driving
habits. has anybody heard of such a device? if not, do you
have any other technical solutions? forget about trying to
get her to drive better - it won't happen.

peace,
ben
