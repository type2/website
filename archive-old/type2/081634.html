Subject: Re: [T2] '71 seat belts

Look at the 'press' seat belts for the white label sewn on the belt with the
part # on it. It will show the date. It will more than likely be 1974 and
later.
The ones with the little white knob should be dated 1973 and older.
The 'press' ones are from a later bus......

&gt; The seatbelts that came with my '71 are in poor shape.  I found another set
&gt; in a '71 that was being parted out.  When those seatbelts arrived, I noticed
&gt; that they have different release buttons from the ones already in my bus.
&gt; The ones in the bus now have the rectangular button in the middle of the
&gt; unit just like my '73...I think the button says &quot;Press&quot;.  The new ones have
&gt; a white lever attached to the side.
&gt;
&gt; I'm just curious if anyone knows the story on the two different styles of
&gt; seat belts from the same year.
