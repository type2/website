Subject: Carabus to Evrybus From N. Virginia
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I've received several emails about forming a carabus to Everybus 2001. I've 
posted some maps and details on a page I created this morning for Everybus 
photos, so ignore the header. I prefer to take Rte. 29 from all the way into 
Greensboro, the best place to meet up with other folks is the Sheetz gas 
station in Opal, VA., right on Rte 29. I know I-81 may be faster, but I hate 
I-81 with it's high amount of 18 wheeler traffic. Rte 29 is also pretty 
scenic, and should be beautiful this time of year. True, you do have to go 
through some towns, but hey, if I wanted to get from point A to point B the 
fastest, I wouldn't be driving a VW bus, right? Here is the link, email me 
with any questions. &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://hometown.aol_dot_com/fonman4277/evb2001.html&quot;&gt;
