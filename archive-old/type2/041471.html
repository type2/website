Picked him up 10 days ago out in California.

Drove him back here to Texas.
Got 23.98 mpg on the 3,386 mile trip, and fell in love with him very 
soon into the very first night of camping in the Yosemite snow.

Now, I have two wonderful 1970 road machines good enuff to strut with 
any day, and good enuff to hit the 4 corners of the world in at a 
moment's desire.
