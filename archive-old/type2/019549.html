Subject: Couple questions;

Hi all;
   In the process of (finally) assembling the engine for my '78 Westy.
Looking for advice/opinions on the use of gasket sealant for the various
subassemblies - oil filler tube to case, intake manifold to head etc.
   Also wondering if there is some sort of lube to use on the pivot
points of the thermo flaps in the fan housing.
   Oh yeah, the engine is a 2.0 liter, '78.

Thanks;
Art Lynch
