      Hi All.

    I thought I'd post a few items I have for sale.

   First is what appears to be a trailer hitch with built in ball for a =
split window bus.
I acquired this years ago and have no use for it. There are 2 chain =
hooks on it as well as an electrical socket for lights. It has surface =
rust and is dirty but looks all there. There is a small data plate on it =
with the following:

      Westfalia-Werk Wiedenbruck
  Bezeichnuwg: kugelkopf
  Tye: KA Grobe:36 Baujehr: 1956
   Zul Anhangelast Dis 1100 kg
   Prurzoichen:  H.524

  I have no idea what this means except maybe 1100kg tongue weight.
The writing on the plate is very small so there may be some errors in my =
writing.

  I also have a trailer hitch I pulled off The Contraption (73 Westy) =
that bolts to the frame using the existing bumper bracket hardware.
 As well I have a mount for a nose mounted spare tire.

I will probably bring these items to Everybus with me if anyone is =
interested.

Thanks
Phil Gowdy
