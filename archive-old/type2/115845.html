I'm not fond of them either but people have been driving pickup trucks to
work for years. A mid-80s Ford Bronco looks like an SUV to me wouldn't you
agree?

The car companies aren't building vehicles they know the public won't
buy...the appeal is there, sometime utilitarian but mostly it's a case of
keeping up with those Jonses.

I think the real crime is that the car companies were allowed to make a
passenger vehicle to truck safety and epa standards. Not many families are
towing 7,000 lbs of groceries.
