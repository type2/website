Subject: Re: Disappearing Exhaust Bolts

&gt; I recently replaced my exhaust system with the two-piece after market
&gt; kit available from
&gt; bus depot. After a month of happy bussing the exhaust started to get
&gt; loud again. I looked
&gt; underneath the bus, and found that I was missing mucho bolts.
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; The exhaust kit did not come with hardware so I was using 5/16&quot; by 1&quot;
&gt; bolts from the
&gt; hardware store.

Ah, herein lies the problem.  Standard hardware-store bolts are coarse
thread, which hold pretty well if the thing they're holding together
isn't moving or vibrating.  Unfortunately, your exhaust system is
doing both!

If you use the proper fine-thread metric bolts you shouldn't have any
further problem with loosening.  In a pinch, you can even use fine
thread SAE bolts, but Dr. Porsche turns 180 degrees in his grave for
each SAE bolt used.

If a bolt persists in loosening, the final solution is safety wire.
