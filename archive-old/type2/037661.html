Subject: Congrats Monica

I wasn't involved or know anyone personally who was, but have monitored your
experinces/the saga of the Lorax you've posted to the list.

I just want to say: woohoo!!!!  You have been through the ringer with that
thing.  Moreso it seems than any other listees that have posted about their
experinces.

Congratulations and happy motoring!

Live free, feel free. Drive a VW bus - even if it looks like a wedge. ;-P
