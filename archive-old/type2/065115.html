&gt; 
&gt; Hello,
&gt; Here's a funny bumper sticker a friend saw on an old bus (she's not very 
&gt; well-versed on her Volkswagens, so she doesn't know what it was):
&gt; &quot;Honk if anything falls off&quot;    :) 
&gt; I could use one of those.  But it won't do me any good until Cassidy's  
&gt; drivable!
&gt; 
&gt; Amy :)
&gt; 
Amy and others,
I saw the perfect bumper sticker to put on my bus, if only I can find
it.

It said:  &quot;Hang up and drive&quot;

Sean
