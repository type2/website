Subject: Cheap heat.

This idea is so simple it's stupid.  Was messing around this morning, and
the thought hit me since the heat risers are totally uninsulated what would
happen if you wrapped aluminum foil around them.  Took cheap generic thin
aluminum foil, about a foot or so long, maybe 15&quot;, folded in half, wrapped
one around bottom and one around top of each heat riser.  No tape or
anything (though I would probably wire it or something. I did not cover
vents, but my cables are trashed, and I have both flappers wired open for
maximum heat, so it really wouldn't have mattered.  I don't have an electric
fan, but heater does blow pretty well with flappers wide open).

Drove about 10 miles, heater smelled some (have driven a few hundred miles
since I cleaned fan with GUNK, and last smelled it)  Stopped at the gas
station, returned to a bus full of smoke.  Heat risers had never gotten hot
enough to burn out trash blown in them from fan.  Drove about 30 miles, had
to open the windows from the heat (I'll admit, it was 40-45 degrees out, not
that cold but when was the last time YOUR heater made you sweat?)
Held hand over defrost vent, the small amount that blows when defrost is off
was uncomfortably hot after a few seconds.  Probably 15-20 degrees hotter
than yesterday, when I drove about 150 miles.

All of you guys that haven't done this should do it tomorrow.  Next project,
insulating the paper pipes.

probably all it will get)
