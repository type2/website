Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS rescue---Engine runs fine, but dies when the
  engine is  under load.

Faster,

Maybe I mis-spoke.  The engine needs a nice fat spark, *especially* under 
load.  Can't find the info on the net, but I have a vo-tech engine class 
book at home that uses a whole chapter to cover the kettering system and 
talks about how strong a spark is needed at varying engine conditions....hi load, no load, hi rpm, 
low rpm.

You can probably find a book likethis at the local &amp;quot;used&amp;quot; book store...it 
is invaluable!


If the coil is weak, you are going to have problems, if it makes a 
&amp;quot;weaker&amp;quot; spark after it gets warmed up, then when the engine is under a 
heavy load, it may not have a strong enough spark to fire off the mixture.
It's a reach, but possible.  Ask anyone who has tried to drive on a 
failing coil.


Which reminds me of something else....the guys in the bus need to check 
not only the coil, but that the connections to the coil are nice and 
tight!

Cheers, dave

&amp;gt; &amp;gt; are fine.  If you don't get a new coil soon, then next time it happens, 
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; see how it feels and try coooling it off with some water/ice in a plastic 
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; bag and then try the same hill.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; I'm a bit confused by this. The coil should not see any more load at
&amp;gt; any time, right? There is nothing to give feedback to the coil that
&amp;gt; says &amp;quot;Scotty, I need more spark&amp;quot;. It always does it's job the same
&amp;gt; way. However could a bad coil cause the spark to become very weak when
&amp;gt; hot? If this is the case, would a visual inspection of the spark be
&amp;gt; possible to see a difference?
&lt;/pre&gt;
