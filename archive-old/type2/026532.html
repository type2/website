&gt;Is there some kind of authorized lubricant for fuel hoses? 
&gt;Other things I've contemplated: lightweight honing oil, moly 
&gt;grease, cornstarch (might turn the gas to gravy in the tank?).

I usually just spit on it.  Not a lugie - those are too thick and slimy.
Not very high-tech, but it's been working for me for 15 years.  And I
wouldn't be surprised to hear that Hans and Fritz were using the same
technique on the VW assembly line 40 years ago!  If I'm too parched, I use
WD-40.  Seems to work better than spit, but it's not as satisfying.
