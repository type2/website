Subject: Re: [VB] welding and a new website

OK, don't laugh, but I've been using a Dremel to cut out some sheet metal on 
my '76 this past week. I started out using Dremels own brand of heavy duty 
cut off wheels, but they wore down in about 5 inches of cutting. Bought some 
cut off wheels from Black &amp; Decker, and they last much longer. I'm cut out 
the rocker area between the sliding door and rear wheel, about 8 inches up. 
The Dremel is easy to control, and gets into tight places. I was surprised to 
see how sturdy a bus is, and very disappointed to see the difference in the 
thickness of the sheet metal I was cutting out compared to the replacement 
panel I have from RMMW. Once most of the panel was cut out I used a 36 grit 
grinding disk to grind down the rest. I also had to do a bit of trimming to 
the new panel to get it to fit. I have it clamped in place right now, hoping 
to weld it in tomorrow. Next its on to the battery tray area, then the 
doglegs, the one area I'm really not looking forward to-it looks like a tough 
area to cut out, certainly beyond the Dremels capability. Hope to get some 
pics to post of what I'm doing, maybe in a couple of weeks.        Jeff S.
