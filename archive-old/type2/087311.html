Subject: more##_at_&quot;&quot;??-_+fuel injection



Hello Friends,
More adventures in fuel injection on my '78 Westy which persists in going full rich and flooding.

The givens:
1. New AVP motor
2. It runs fine and then will either not start and flood with fuel running out of the exhaust system or will die on the road with the same fuel running out.
3. I've checked everything according to the VW fuel injection manual.  Including:
     A. the head temp sensor.  It' good.
     B. the cold start valve has been plumbed out 
        of the system i.e. a hose takes the fuel
        around it.
     C. The air flow meter has been checked.  Both
        of the resistances are on spec.
     D. The fuel pressure is fine.  35lb.
     E. I tried another computer. Lent to me by a 
        very generous list member.  It made no 
        difference.   
     F. I checked one injector and got a weak 
        pulsing light.  This seems fine.
4.  I have driven it like this for about 500 miles
and it seems as if the good spells are getting fewer and shorter.
5.  Now the one possiblity is that one of these parts has failed intermittently and will test bad when the thing won't run, but I've tested this stuff repeatedly and haven't been able to find it.
6.  The local VW guru and the not so local VW dealer have tried to fix it and they haven't done anything I haven't done nor have they done it as well as I have.  They each missed things that I eventually found.

I am out of ideas!  Any help would be very appreciated.  Most of the ideas that list members have suggested of course followed the VW manual.  Thanks.  One of the worse things about this whole business is that this is the best looking and running (before) Westies I have ever seen.  It hasn't been all hacked up.

Thanks in advance (again) for any suggestions.

Drew
