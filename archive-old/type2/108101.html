Subject: Re: [T2] Towing Jetta for 100 miles

&gt; Can someone please advise a safe, legal &amp; affordable way to tow a scrap Jetta for 100 miles?

I saw a couple of replies that said to use a tow dolly and leave the rear wheels on the ground.

Before you go this route, you need to check the Vehicle Code in the state you live in. Here in California, in
order to legally use a tow dolly, the towed vehicle must be currently registered. You cannot have any part of
a non or expired registration vehicle on any street. Even if it is non-op'd. You would need a car trailer to
legally move the vehicle. If you get a ticket for having a non-op'd vehicle on the street, it nullifies the
non-op status and besides the fine and risk of impoundment you also must pay the past registration fees and
penalties that the non-op status waived......
