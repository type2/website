whoo Yaaa!


So i feel i ought to name it - ive been thinking about Ulyseus or maybe
even Shirley.
////////
I like Ulyseus.      name it whatever feels right.  each bus has it's own
personality

naming a car makes it a person, or a pet- my buses are Nellie, Montana, Mr.
Truck, and then Bugster.  

It can take a long time for a VW to reveal it's name, Montana was unnamed for
years.
