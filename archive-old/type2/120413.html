&gt; It has a loss of power when climbing hills. I was just going to replace the
&gt; plugs and while they were out do a compression test. So there must be some
&gt; leak in there. This is in 79, air cooled, fuel injected, electronic
&gt; ignition, 2.0 liter, long block engine I bought about 2 years and 25,000
&gt; miles ago.

since this is a 79 w/ 2L it should have hydraulic lifters. Was the
compression test done with the engine warmed and all lifters pumped
up? this can affect the compression test outcome. A leak-down test
would be a good idea after a rocker arm inspection. Then if all this
tests out as the #3 still bad you can think about pulling the engine
and looking at that head.
