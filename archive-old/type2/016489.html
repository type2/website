Subject: Re: 3 Bay Westie questions

&gt;While putting the new 77 Westie automatic back to original condition,
&gt;(Change the stats. another CA Westie comes to Canada &lt;GRIN&gt;) I've
&gt;uncovered some things I've not seen before.
&gt;
&gt;- There are factory snaps along the inside lower edge of the sliding
&gt;door front sill...any idea what attaches to them???

The snaps are for the optional tent. Apparently yours has one or had
one.
