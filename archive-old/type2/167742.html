Subject: Re: [T2] Re: No Fire on #2 and #4?

Karl,

I am 100% positive that it is #2 and #4 and 100% positive that I do not
have the wires swapped.

(unfortunately, I wish it was something simple)

Cheers,

&gt; Yeah, I'm thinking more and more that it's a vacuum leak at the manifold head.  Spraying WD40 or other
&gt; flammables hasn't resulted in anything totally conclusive, but I'm to the point where I'm just gonna pull the
&gt; manifold, remove and inspect the existing crush washers, then throw on new
&gt; washers and see how it does.

&gt; Are you really SURE it is 2 and 4??
&gt;
&gt; The only thing they have in common is the camshaft....
&gt;
&gt; If you really mean 2 and 4, are you SURE you don't have the 2 and 4 plug wires swapped??
