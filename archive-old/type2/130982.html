Subject: RE: [T2] Rear Wheel Not Turning

They are weird. I bet the shoe assemply isn't right somehow, I had to play 
with mine forever to get it right. Maybe it's too far adjusted in and needs 
to come out a bit to clear? Is wheel bearing flush? Is your other one 
together to look and use as a reference? Can you post a pic of it?

&gt;I'm rebuilding the rear brakes of my 71 T2. I turn the adjuster nuts
&gt;so the brand new shoes are farthest away from the brand new drum (the
&gt;screws that move the shoes outwards are retracted in as far as they
&gt;will go.)
