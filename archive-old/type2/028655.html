I just recently purchased a '77 bus with a 2.0liter fuel injection.  The bus
had been sitting for 3 months.  Anyway the bus was in good physical shape
and the price was good.  I am wondering what things I need to check before I
even begin to try to start this motor up?  My assumptions are to check to
see that the valve lash is set properly.  Check if there is spark.  Check if
there is fuel getting to the fuel injectors.  I did notice that the air flow
sending unit appears to have been opened up.  Are there any adjustments
within this unit that need to be made?  It also appears that the boot
attached to this unit is disconnected.  Another question I have is do I
check the compression of each cylinder as well to see whether or not I need
to rebuild the engine? I have the gauges for the compression test do I check
it with the engine cold or hot?  If the engine does not start how do you
check the compression with the engine hot?

Finally, I would like to keep this bus out of the graveyard.  I basically
need some pre-startup pointers so that I don't waste too much time
troubleshooting in the wrong direction.  I do have a chiltons manual on this
model as well as John Muirs book &quot;How to keep your volkswagen alive.&quot;
However, John Muirs book does not cover this type of fuel injection and the
Chiltons manual is poorly written and written for every aircooled engine VW
put out during the 70's and early 80's.  I can find the individual
proceedures within the Chiltons manual but wonder what would be the most
time efficient method.
