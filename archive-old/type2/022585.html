My bus is Titan Red and Beige Grey. It has been re-painted but I can use my 
door jambs as reference. My dash and fresh air housing are original paint and 
are more Beige color than the Beige Grey on my jambs. .
--------
Titian was a painted who used amazing coours, and VW evidently liked a red 
Titian (Tish-an) was fond of.  Titans are large mythological monster 
creatures.

Paint fades, and exposure to sun and light and weather changes it fading.     
ya you can find the original pain on the same bus having different shades.    
It is hard to figure out the right shade of colour - will the real beige grey 
please stand up?   You might want to look behind the seat for a less exposed 
area of paint, and clean it up to get a better idea of Beige Grey.         
Look in the engine compartment forTitian Red

Also, when I pulled the overriders from my bumpers, I found what I think is 
the original bumper paint-a very light silver/grey.


Were the bumpers, popouts and dash painted different colors than the beige 
grey above the beltline?

------
yes- the bumpers and rims were painted silver white.  the dash and popouts 
were painted the same as the top half as the bus
