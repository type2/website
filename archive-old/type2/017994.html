Re: Cooper SRMII

I seem to recall that the SRMIIs were too pricey for my taste, back when
I was shopping for tires a few months ago.  I did bookmark the site:

BTW, The picture of the 185R14C (D load range) is the picture on the
right, with the four ribs, according to a note at the bottom of the
page.
