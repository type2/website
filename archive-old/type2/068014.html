 &gt;         Tried re-jetting and lowering the float level, but the 2500 rpm
 &gt;         CO just got worst.

 &gt;         Really don't want to buy a new carb unless I know that it will
 &gt;         definitly fix the problem.

If the engine is in tune (valves, points, timing, etc.), and not
extremely worn, then the problem is the carb. Your engine should not
have a hard time passing the smog test.  I have passed smog tests even
with a high-mile worn engine in a 63 camper.

The solex 34 PICT 3 sucks. It just barely works when you get a new one.
have not had much luck rebuilding them more than once. The shaft wears 
the pot metal body, etc. It is not an extremely high quality carb. It is
quite likely that a new one will fix the problem.

 &gt; *       What is a good price for a new one. Saw $159 in JCWhipme, and
 &gt;         an Repair shop quoted me $169 + tax here in CA.
 &gt; 
 &gt;         Oh yea, found out that my CO will pass in DENVER (8.5 allowed),
 &gt;         anyone there want a bus? (just kidding, I am not selling, but my
 &gt;         home state is pissing me off!!!)

Max allowable for my 62 single cab in Denver is 5.5%, so I suspect you've
got the wrong information. (I know this is correct; I tuned it today).

$169 is cheaper than a new car....
