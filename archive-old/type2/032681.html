Subject: Boneyard in Piedmont of NC

Came off the mountain this weekend to visit a small boneyard over near
Greeensboro NC (We have a dearth of choices here in Western NC). Looked very
small from outside, but had a gazzilion bugs, 10-12 busses 4 squarebacks, 4
KG etc. Owner Scott Davis cut out a whole front roof section, back to the
pillars, that will patch our squished hightop next year, and a front clip
for the current KG project...both at pretty fair prices. He had a ton of
stuff and seemed like a reasonable guy...you might try him if you're from
that area.

to destroy...
