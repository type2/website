It goes in the engine bay, opposite the main battery.  You probably have a
second battery there.  You may have to pull your engine, but I'm not sure on
this.

Consider also the BA6 which is under the van, inline with the main heat duct
to the front pumping hot air into the existing heating system.  Only
necessary hole is for a recirculation fan under the back seat.

Seach archives and www.type2_dot_com library for BA6 info.

Manual for BA6 and BN4 can be found at:

http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/eber/index.html

BA6's were in vans from 1974 through to 1984 as they were put in the Vanogon
as well.  Parts are, of course, unavailable.  If you pull one from a wreck,
make sure to do your research first so you get all the parts.  There is
stuff in the cab you will need, and stuff underneath.

There is an article at type2_dot_com on doing just htis.  Study the manuals and
you will sort out what must be done fairly easily.

Hello all,

I want to install a BN4 heater to my 71 Non Pop Top Camper (I am freezing my
ass off up here in NY!) - It didn't origionally have one, so where is the
best place to install it with out chopping up the camper?  Any suggestions
from the listees that have on pre-installed?  Thanks!
