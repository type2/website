&gt;  My most notable experience was at Everybus 2000.  With-in minutes 
&gt;of pulling in someone came over to strike up a conversation, when 
&gt;they realized I was far from home they took me around to the various 
&gt;groups of buses and introduced me to a lot of people.  At one of 
&gt;those campfires I was invited to stay for dinner.  I spent the 
&gt;evening sitting around their fire, eating their food, drinking their 
&gt;beer, and swapping bus stories.

There is never a shortage of kind and generous people that camp in VW 
buses. Camping events are definitely the way to spend you time if you 
want get to know people and buses. I do not even bother attending 
shows any more. For $12 you can listen to 2.4 L beetles do the 
quarter mile or spend a day and night camping with other buses.
