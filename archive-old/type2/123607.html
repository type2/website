Subject: vwtrends back issues FS

i have a huge mammajamma stack of VwTrends back issues i need to 
sell... from the 70s to the 2000s.
i'd take $200 for all and i'll pay shipping; or $10 for the 00s, $12 
for the 90s, $15 for the 80s and $20 for the 70s. this would be for 
complete years, and i'd pay media mail to the continental states. 
discounts for incomplete years :)
pmail me for a list. sorry, i'm not selling individual issues.
