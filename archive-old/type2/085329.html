Subject: RE: [T2] POR-15 questions

I also feel that POR-15 is worth the money. Most people that I have talked
to that have had problems did not apply it correctly. I have even done this
myself, when I have been lazy. Read the website or the documentation with
the product. Also they have great email support. I use the recommended
procedure most of the time and have no problems.

Just remember that por 15 goes on bare metal or rust, not other paint. If
put on other paint, the old paint may flake and cause the POR 15 to come
off.

I have only used this product for about a year, so I cannot vouch for how
long it really lasts, but so far it has worked great for me.

Their other products are also very good. I use Pelucid, spelled something
like that, on wood at home and have been very happy with the results.

Larry,

In my opinion, por-15 is worth every penny.

Go back to their site and read the FAQ.  You don't have to use all 4 
items...if you sandblast or clean otherwise, or some other gotcha's.

Their site lists everything you need to know.

Basically, por-15 like something other than shiny/greasy metal....it wants 
something with &quot;tooth&quot;.  por-15 is suseptible to uv light(sunlight) so you 
need to paint over it if it is in sunlight.

A quart seems to cover more than I ever thought it would.

*Read* the warnings!  Wear a respirator.


Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi all - I've been hearing and reading a lot about this stuff called
POR-15, 
&gt; and would like to get the list members' opinions on it.  Any good or bad 
&gt; comments would be welcome, I just want honest ones.  A concern for me is
the 
&gt; cost.  According to the POR-15 website, you should use four steps to
prepare 
&gt; and finish the surface:  (1) Marine Clean, (2) Metal Ready, (3) POR-15,
and 
&gt; (4) Chassiscoat Black.  The website lists prices for a gallon of each as:

&gt; $28.75, $28.75, $95.00, and $140.00.  Is it worth the expense?  Do you
HAVE 
&gt; to use all four chemicals?  How much coverage will you get with a 
&gt; pint/quart/gallon?  Reviews of POR-15 I've seen are positive, but that's a

&gt; lot of money for me on top of the other parts and repairs I'm getting.  
&gt; Thanks for your advice!
&gt;
