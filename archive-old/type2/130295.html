Subject: Re: [T2] Brake booster for a '73

&gt;&gt; I'm going to cap it off for now, not like it's doing anything anyway, 
&gt;&gt; but I really would like it to work...

&gt; Bus is heavy, and you need the boost if you want to 
&gt;stop in any reasonable distance (try braking with the pedal when the 
&gt;engine isn't running, notice how difficult the pedal is to push).

It should be noted that braking with or without the booster makes NO
difference in stopping distance.  The only difference it makes is in how
much leg strength it takes to push the brake pedal.

I ran my 73 Westy with dual Webers for 8 years with no vacuum assist and
never had any braking issues other than the increased pedal effort.  The
only time I really missed the vacuum assist was when sitting at a long
traffic light on a hill.  Your leg can get a little tired after a couple of
minutes.
