&gt; I noticed in my Bentley manual 71 electrical schematics that there are
dash mounted &gt;fresh air ventilation fans.  

I have wondered about this too but they must be as rare as optinal disc
brakes on the '70 bus. Here is an idea though. I bought a 12volt fan from
FLAPS and mounted on the dash by using all those little holes for the
&quot;speaker.&quot; It is a nice clean install. The fan is most helpful in slow
traffic or at stoplights when no air is nor normall circulating. It makes
little difference at hwy speeds but the 265 AC kicks in anyway : )&gt;

Although I do not have any added on gauges it seems that the &quot;speaker grill&quot;
would be a good nondestructive place to mount a guage cluster.
