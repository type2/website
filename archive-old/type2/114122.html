Subject: Re: [T2] solex 2 barrel

Run away! Run away very quickly!!! These guys are suspect.

They are trying to sell you a center mount Weber  carb without some warning 
or explanation. Not a very good solution unless they want to add an air 
cleaner with a heated air intake for cold weather(ala late 70's Toyota or 
Pinto) . Center mount carbs work with enough engineering but I doubt these 
guys are going to tell you this. Center mount carbs are not an all weather 
solution. Cold weather will leave you problems.

Beetle motors have heated intakes to combat this problem and so a kit 
without some heated provision is going to have freezing  problems. This 
happens on Corvairs with center mount carbs too.

A better solution is a dual Weber ICT kit. True the stock Solex carbs are 
getting old. If you don't need yours pass them on to another list member 
who might be able to use them for parts. Buy the kit from one of the list 
suppliers and install it yourself. It took me a week to figure it out and I 
did not install mine (thus disabling the vehicle) until I had it pretty 
well figured out  on the work bench.
