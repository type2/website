Subject: Re: [T2] looking for gas cap, westy electrical inlet

I was actually looking for a used original
cap and other thing. sorry I did'nt specify
thanks
willis


&gt;&gt; gas cap for a late bay and the plastic
&gt;&gt; electrical thing that goes on the outside
&gt;&gt; of the bus?  Preferably in decent shape.
&gt;
&gt;I got a new locking gas cap from Bus Depot. Its great, nice tight fit. They
&gt;might have the electical outlet also.
