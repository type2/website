Subject: Re: What's that hole...

Greg:

&gt;a large hole
&gt;between the left engine mounting stud and the centerline
&gt;of the engine

The hole is there for the purpose of accessing bolts on the flex-plate
on buses equipped with automatic transmissions.  It is usually covered
by a plastic plug.

&gt;oil just spewing out of mine

Assuming yours is a manual transmission, it would seem that you have a
blown front seal, and the flywheel is slinging it out this hole.
