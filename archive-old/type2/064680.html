This sounds like one of:

- - poorly-seated wires.  This usually happens because the rubber boot
  doesn't fit on the distributor cap very well, or the other end is
  too tight to go onto the plug.
- - bad distributor cap.  Pop it off, and check the five contacts
  (center, plus one for each plug).  They should all be fairly shiny.
- - bad rotor.  Make sure the center and the outer edge of the metal
  part is shiny.  Make sure it reaches all the way to the outer
  contacts inside the distributor cap.
- - incorrect spark gap on the plugs.  Let it cool, and check them.  If
  #1 and #2 are noticeably different from #3 and #4, that's your
  problem.
- - bad ground for the right-side plugs.  Using lots of anti-seize,
  permatex, or some other thread-lining substance can cause this.  You
  shouldn't need to put anything on the threads.  A poorly done
  helicoil might do it, also.

At least it's a few things to look at.  I'm assuming a single-
carburetor system.  If you've got two, then make sure they are
synchronized, both getting fuel, and all that rot.
