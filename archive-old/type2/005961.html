Ok, for the straight dope. I have a 73 Type II Westy- It is in need of 
major body repair (rust) and is a major eyesore. (westy orange spotted with 
grey primer and rust holes. ) I have a line on a dead vanagon 2.0 FI 
aircooled (80-83.5), and for the sake of beauty (and my wife allowing me to 
keep a VW) I am considering starting a frankenbus project.

I am interested in any Faq/Procedures that would allow me to swap an 1800cc 
T4 into an 80-83 Vanagon- From the information I know- It is somewhat 
complex.

Issues to address:

1. Clutch/Flywheel which is better? Is there a clearance problem with the 
tranny ? The Pre 83.5 Vanagons are 2.0FI. Will it Bolt up ?
2. Heads &amp; Exhaust- I think the Vanagon exhaust and heatboxes are 
different. Do I have to switch the heads, heatboxes and exhaust ?
3. Deck clearance- I have a webber progressive kit- Will it clear the deck 
lid ? Or do I have to switch it to FI ?
4. Oil Dipstick Placement ?
 and so on...
So many questions to ask.. So if there is a step procedure to make an 
frankenbus with a T4 and a Vanagon chassis, could somebody send me the 
info.

Thanks
