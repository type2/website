Subject: T4 Oil Pressure Sending unit adapter wanted

So I got the dual sending unit to install my new VDO oil pressure guage and
now I need to make/find an adapter pipe/hose to complete the install. Looks
like the adapter kit is NLA. I am wondering if anyone has a piece of pipe
with metric threads? 10 X 1? You guys know what I'm looking for here. I
really don't look forward to hunting around Northern VA/ DC area to find a
2&quot; piece of pipe with the right ends on it, given the fact that I can't
even seem to locate a half way decent VW friendly FLAPS, and my Spanish
sucks too. So why don't one of you nice folks tell me you have just the
piece I need and can sell/give it to me for a righteous price?
