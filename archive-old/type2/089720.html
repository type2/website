Subject: Re: [T2] What is this??? anyone know?

Dave Russell..I used your info to look up a parts index for 1973 bus 
carburated and the part number is a match.  You win the prize (whatever 
it is) for the part id.  Bracket (2 req) for air cleaner.

&gt;
&gt;&gt; They were with some carburetor parts but I couldn't
&gt;&gt; find any way that they attached to the carbs. Any
&gt;&gt; thoughts???
&gt;&gt; Thanks!

&gt;
&gt; Dave, if you haven't gotten any replies, those sure look like the 
&gt; brackets that
&gt; mount to the engine block, between the Carbs, to hold the Air Filter 
&gt; assembly.
&gt; They look like the ones that I had on my '73, with 1700 engine.  That 
&gt; was a
&gt; paper filter Air Filter.  Hope this helps.
