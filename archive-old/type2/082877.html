Subject: Re: [T2] Upcoming trip

HI,
I live in Denver and I noticed that you are
considering going through Santa Fe. I probably
wouldn't do this because you would probably have to
use I-25 to cross into NM. This means crossing Raton
Pass. This is not an easy going thing to do. If you do
do this I would make sure that the weather is good.
The trip down 25 to CO springs is not very fun so I go
up 285 to the pine Junction road. This will take you
to woodland park( home of Rocky Mountain Motorworks)
this is a great drive, there are some climbs but no
big deal. I drove a bus that a friend was buying( wich
was only running on three cylinders) with no problems.
I would say that this is a bueatiful drive and has
very little traffic. Once you get to woodland Park it
is a maybe ten minute drive to Colorado Springs. This
just adds some color. Past that there isn't much else
to see in colorado south of Denver along I-25 or east
of denver if you decide to go that way.
If you get to Denver and the bus needs anything

&gt; Hello,
&gt; I'm new to this mail list and to the Volkswagen
&gt; phenom. I've just purchased a '78 Westfalia and am
&gt; picking it up next week. My wife and I fly to Denver
&gt; from our home in Michigan and will meander our way
&gt; back home slowly. My question is; are there any
&gt; interesting places to go or see on our way back? We
&gt; have four daze to make the trip and have considered
&gt; Memphis, Santa Fe, and St. Louis. Any help from
&gt; people who've made this trip or lives somewhere in
&gt; between would be greatly appreciated. FYI, I've
&gt; purchased a new copy of John Muir's book and a good
&gt; road atlas. Hopefully, I won't need the former. Oh
&gt; yeah, I love this list and you all seem like a great
&gt; bunch of people.

&gt; new '78 Westy (no name yet)
