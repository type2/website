  On the subject of bike racks- I have(had) one I think came from JC 
Whittney- It mounted on the front bumper- and had two arms that extended 
aout about a foot to hold two bikes. It worked great because I would have 
to park and then ride my bike to campus. Just throw it on the front, strap 
it on, and I was gone. I had it until about a year ago- my 72 was crunched 
by a hit and run driver (no bike on board at the time) (turned out she was 
drunk, on a suspended license  and on medication). This bike rack also had 
two long bolts about 1/2 &quot; thick and 8 inches long at the bottom. They were 
probably supposed to be cut off after mounting the rack. Turns out that 
after smashing my bus ( front steering box no-less) and knocking the rear 
window out without breaking it, as well as dislodging my camper closet that 
I thought would never move after banging it in place - these 2 big bolts 
actually harpooned her fiberglass front end, and punctured her radiator and 
who knows what else. The police just followed the trail of fluids to find 
her car stashed in an apartment complex about a half mile away. Now 
collecting the insurance for the damage is another story.

2 cents
Nothing witty to say, nobody to quote.
