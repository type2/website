I've used the same system for my drain plug after looking all over town for

a hex-head socket. I can't take credit for inventing it though, while

looking for a socket to fit, I took a 17mm hex bolt to a hardware store and

told the guy &quot;this fits perfectly&quot; he went over to the metric nut bins and

took out two, screwed them on to the bolt and said &quot;here's your answer.&quot; I

looked at it for a couple of seconds and then the lights went on. Not only

is it effective, it cost a fraction of what a wrench or socket would.

Not to beat a dead horse; but was this a &quot;real&quot; hardware store? As in not
Home Depot...One more reason to support your local merchants; hardware,
lumber, electrical, etc. Same goes for your VW parts suppliers. When the
&quot;little guys&quot; (who know what goes with what and not just what aisle that
department is) are gone, who ya gonna blame?
