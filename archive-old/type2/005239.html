When I get my van today, first thing I am going to do is pull the motor.  I
assume it used to have FI being a 74...somewhere in the chain of ownership
that was changed to a Weber progressive.

I want to put a 2 liter in it....will the tin and all that fit the same?  I
figure a 2 liter in the bus would really do well.  It appears to be a much
lighter car than my vanagon westy.
