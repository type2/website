Subject: Re: T2-T3 parts interchange

Hi all,
Sorry for the confusion, yep in the land down under the different type 2
models are called generally described as split for T1, bay window for T2, and
generally the rest are known as T3 and T4 etc.
Type 3's get known as fast, notch and square back.

Thanks for the info also, sounds like Trans is no good to me, but the motor
is. I will see how I go on the bits, now I know what's useable to me.
Cheers,
Richard.
