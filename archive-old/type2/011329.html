Subject: KYB front shock questions
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hey there folks,

I'm installing front kyb shocks on my 79 bus and have a question. I
searched the archives (only found oil filled vs. gas shock posts),
and the library only had a vanagon install.

Where do the 2 steel bushings go on the top bolt and the lower stud?

Does the one on the top of the shock go near the bolt head or between
the shock and the buses beam ??

Does the bottom one go next to the torsion arm or after the shock
near the retaining nut ??

Sorry for the silly question, but I just want to make sure I've got
them in right.

TIA,
