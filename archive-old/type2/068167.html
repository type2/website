Hey all,
Sold the '78 tonight.  Kinda sad to see it drive off with the new owner
behind the wheel :( .  But now I've got an '81 to play with.  

I got $1500 for it, which is basically what I expected to get anyway.  

Joel, I guess you can remove that '78 from the statz :(

It's good that I sold it, but it's sad that it's gone.

Sean
