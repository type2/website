&gt; Have you ever drooled over the pictures in &quot;The Original VW-bus&quot;. The
 &gt; section on bay window buses starts with a picture of a beautiful '69 de
&gt; Luxe
 &gt; parked along an Amsterdam canal. Today I BOUGHT THIS BUS!!!


Jan,
You lucky &amp;^£$£&quot;^%. Nice to see it in good hands, look after it and keep photos of it on your site so that we can keep an eye on it!!!  . When I saw it the first time in &quot;The Original VW-bus&quot; I thought it was one of those busses that we all secretly would love to own.

Mike
