Hi!

&gt; The recent posts about driving in Mexico have me curious about the engines
&gt; in the Mexican Busses.  I know the most recent ones are water cooled,
&gt; starting in about 1998.  But before that, were they type 4 design or
&gt; something else?

AFAIK, Mexican buses up to '91 used the Type 1 engine, and from
'92 through '96 the watercooled inline four 1800cc from the
Golf/Passat/whatever.  Production of Buses then was transferred
to Brasilia, where they're being built with Type 1 engines for
the home market (I saw the '98 they have in the AutoMuseum
Wolfsburg), and AFAICT with the same watercooled inline four 
for export to Mexico.

But don't sue me if I'm wrong on this.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
