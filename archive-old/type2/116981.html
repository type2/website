Subject: Removing Permanent Marker from Paint

Some local teenagers must have been a little bored the other night because
I came outside this morning to find a black triangle drawn on my bus and on
several other nearby cars. If this was someone's &quot;tag&quot; its pretty f'ing
weak! So kids will be kids and I'm not that upset, would be different if it
had been done with a key.... Anyone have any ideas for removing the marker
without damaging the paint? I was thinking of trying some Bug and Tar
remover but I don't know if it will cut it. I am hesitant to try any
solvents but maybe some &quot;goof-off&quot;?
