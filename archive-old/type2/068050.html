Subject: Re: FREE splitty Sundial camper interior

Well folks, I just picked up a '67 Sundial camper for parts. Runs &amp; drives
for
150 bucks. The interior isn't in the greatest shape, then again it's a
Sundial
conversion, so it looked rather cheezy from the get go. I was wondering if
there
was anyone out there that has a Sundial that could use some interior parts.
So
the interior is free to the first person who picks it up. Otherwise it gets
crushed with the rest of the bus.

You are going to CRUSH  a drivable splitty????
