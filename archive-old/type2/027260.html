&gt;&gt;If you adjust them clockwise you have to overcome the buildup of pressure 
&gt;&gt;(compression) in each stroke. &lt;&lt;

Another newbie question:  Is is normal practice to look at your plugs every 
oil change and valve adjustment?  If so, having the plugs out will let the 
air escape and then no compression.  Still learning...
