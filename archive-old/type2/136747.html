&gt;General opinion of my extended family here is that the cold weather has

&gt;Does this sound like a reasonable diagnosis?  Figure it's time to 
&gt;replace the starter?

The battery is having a harder  time in that weather for sure but if you don't have a charger around you'll have a hard time ruling the battery out. What is your battery voltage at?

First try to clean all of the connections (battery terminals, starter terminals, both ground straps). That can make a bigger difference than most people realize.

Can you jump terminal 50 to terminal 30 to start the engine? This is best done with a remote starter but you can simply short them together briefly.

When you bought your bus didn't you remove a solenoid type hard start relay from it?
