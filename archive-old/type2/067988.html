Don't let oil, degreasers, etc go down the storm drain or on the ground.
In most places in the US, it will go, completely untreated, into the
nearest river, lake, or bay. 

So what can we do? Well, in the Puget Sound area, all self-service car
washes are required to collect all the runoff on their property,
pre-treat it (I'm not sure how, or how much.), and discharge it to the
regular sewer system, not storm drainage system. Sewer water is treated
and monitored. This might mean that it's okay to clean your engine at
one of these places. It also might mean that in *some* areas it's okay
to dump *some* chemicals in the toilet, though I'm not sure which
chemicals are alright, so I haven't done it.

A lot of areas have organizations that spread the word on the best ways
to deal with toxic junk. In your area it might be the Chesapeake Bay
Keeper. I'll see if I can find out more, and post it when I do.

&gt;&gt; Another question for the environmentally friendly.  What would this 
&gt;&gt; do to my septic system? (I'm out in the boonies) and conversely what 
&gt;&gt; would this do to centralized sewage treatment? (It probably can 
&gt;&gt; handle it without much problem, is my guess)

&gt;Well, it would be a little like changing your oil and dumping the used
&gt;stuff in your toilet.  It *is* out of sight, but it has hardly
&gt;disappeared.  I ain't the most environmentally correct person, but I know
&gt;that pretty much whatever you do, engine drippings, dirty kerosene, old
&gt;grease, etc. are a mess from an environmental standpoint.  I would love to
&gt;hear what the best/worst cases for disposal are.  I have always been leery
&gt;even of using the spray-on, wash-off engine degreasers, as I live less
&gt;than a mile from a major tributary to the Chesapeake Bay, and I *know*
&gt;that is where the storm sewer goes.  At the same time, EC or not, there is
&gt;no way I can think of to collect it.
