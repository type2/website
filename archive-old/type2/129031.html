Subject: 71 Transporter posted in air cooled NG &amp; Craig's List

As you are all (prob painfully) aware I've been looking for a good home 
for the 71;


&lt;http://www.geocities_dot_com/tberk_at_sbcglobal_dot_net/main_page.html&gt;


I posted to the rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled NewsGroup as well as 
Craig's List- &lt;http://www.craigslist_dot_org&gt;, CL is a great place for lots 
of things, if you haven't yet looked it over, check it out.

I have extended the deadline w/ the roommate to this coming weekend, 
that's only a few days but otherwise it'll be left for scavengers to crush.

Anybody want to come save this thing? While I am hoping to cover cost up 
to this point, It's not about the money.
