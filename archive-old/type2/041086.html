Subject: Tanny Output Shaft

Volks,

I  need your help once again in solving my latest problem with my Bus. So 
here goes, Bus was driving fine 2 days ago no problems at all. Drove to work 
yesterday morning and noticed that it was a little hard to get into gear 
sometimes. After work I tried to go home but when I started it and tried to 
move it made grinding noises and sounded like something was slipping and I 
could feel the pressure from the tranny on the clutch pedal. I called CAA 
and had them tow it to the garage. I just got back from there and their 
assement was that it is either the throw out arm on the clutch or the output 
shaft of the tranny. It only seems to happen in 1st or reverse. I just drove 
it home from the garage(cause I'm not having them drop the engine for way to 
much $$$$)and it only happened in 1st leaving the garage. It shifted fine 
all the way home with no problems, so the clutch is fine. I just got it in 
the driveway and let it run for 5 mins then I was gonna test it out and see 
what happened. I can't even get the gear shift to go anywhere near 1st or 
2nd, it will only stay on the side with 3rd and 4th. I am gonna go out and 
check the linkage from the gear shift to the tranny right now I think. It 
unfortunatly looks like I will be doing my first engine pull sooner than 
expected. If it is the output of the tranny how hard it to replace? or 
should I just start looking for a new tranny? I just can't belive that there 
were no warning signs that this was gonna happen was driving fine one day 
and done the next. All help appreciated.

Thanks,
