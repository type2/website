&lt;&lt;Probably the Yokohama Y356 in load range C if you are only going by
price. $58/tire at Tire Rack right now.&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;This is right on the top of the worst new tire's I have ever
purchased--Hands down. Had them siped at ??Discount tire a,d they still
were terrible in the wet &amp; snow. An awfully hard riding tire, and short
winded--22-3,000 miles and they were done.&lt;&lt;

The Y356s say &quot;Highway Rib Summer&quot;. This seems pretty apparent they
arent meant for wet conditions.
I have Y356s, and I bought them knowing the were &quot;Highway Rib Summer&quot;.
Luckily I live in the desert, where it rains twice a year, and never
snows.
