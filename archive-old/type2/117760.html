Subject: spare tire dunce here

Guys,

Can someone explain to me how to put the strap on my spare tire?

I can't make out the picture in the library online manual and thought I 
had done it right....but I can't get the cover on all the way.

Here's what I did.  

Ran the free end(without the buckle) up through the bottom metal &quot;loop&quot;, 
thru the second metal loop and the over the tire.  Pulled the metal buckle 
part with the plastic part tight on the inside lug part of the rim tight 
and went, great, perfect....

But!, I can't get the spare tire cover back on.  It seems to hang up on 
the part of the strap that is going from the top loop over the tire and 
down to the buckle.

I can rebuild engines and put glass in, but this one escapes me.


Funny coments accepted&lt;grin&gt;.

Cheers, dave
