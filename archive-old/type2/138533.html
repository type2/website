Subject: RE: [T2] once upon a pre-owned tuna can

I understand where Jason's coming from, I understand the frustration of 
relying on a bus as a daily driver, especially when it's your only vehicle. 
It's just alot of pressure to fix your bus when you need to drive it the 
next day to work. For being your only car where you have to drive alot of 
miles it's not all that pratical to drive a bus unless it's in really good 
mechanical shape and being kept that way.

Employers often aren't very forgiving when you are often late due to not 
starting or breaking down or not able to find rides to work because your bus 
isn't running. In an ideal world you wouldn't ever have to be specific 
places at specific times but our society just isn't like that.

But I'm worried that a Mitzoobitchy at 190K is going to have some serious 
problems soon and it will be alot harder to work on and require special 
tools that the bus.

Ah, I'm really not worried. :)

Daniel

&gt;a
