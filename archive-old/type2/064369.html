&gt; &gt;  IMHO buy a brand
&gt; &gt; new good quality set, and have em powder coated, best you can do.

&gt; 
&gt; Another option to powder coating is hot-aluminum coating (or whatever
&gt; it's called).  A few high-tech coating companies can spray aluminum
&gt; at it's liquid temp, and coat metal like paint.  All you need to do
&gt;
Powder coating has the benefit of being able to some extent to also
adhere inside as it is an electrostaticlly applied process, cermaicote,
jet-hot, etc. I'm not sure, but may be a similar process.  For the
matter of it all, just dipping a set in flat black quality oil based
enamel might do a wonderful job but be a bit tough to do.
