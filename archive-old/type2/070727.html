Subject: Re: [T2] 3 little questions
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

&gt;1) What is the fuel capacity for the '74 - '79 bus? 15 gallons?

15.8ish

&gt;2) What PSI is the windsheild washer bottle supposed to be at?

42psi max.

&gt;3) How much fuel does the RESERVE hold? (mine seems to last forever!!)

There really is not a reserve. Modern cars have an orange warning 
area. With exception of buses that were made prior to 1962ish and had 
a real 1 gal reserve(buses without gas gauges) the reserve is just 
warning you that have about a gallon left. In my 67 bus when the 
needle hits R there are about 1.5 gallons left when it is full the 
needle does not quite hit 1/1 (this is what splits have instead of F) 
The 69 had a very accurate gas gauge and the 72 would get bouncy at 
about 1 or two gallons. The 68 Adventurewagen does not really have a 
working gas gauge. The is only a  random sampling .
