Subject: Pushrod tube leaks &amp; cooling flap observation

Good evening, all.

I got a couple good responses on the push rod tube leak question, and I
think we hit on two correct answers.

I didn't get to tearing into the oil leak yesterday, because I dutifully
cleaned my engine's new home, made tail light repairs, &amp; such. This
evening I pulled tin, checked the head and crankcase torque (hadn't
changed), and looked over all the pushrod tube ends. The only signs of
leaks were both on #1 on the head bore, so I pulled the rocker assy,
pushrods, and tubes.

Intake side tube looks like I pinched the seal upon installation. I
tried to be careful of this, but it looks like I cut this one. The bore
for this tube looks good. Glad I have an extra set of these seals.

Exhaust side tube seal looked good, but there was a strange bump at one
point in the seal. Cleaned the bore and looked more closely. Sure
enough, there's a &quot;dent&quot; in the bore right where the seal sits... bottom
side, no less! It's about 3/32&quot; wide and probably about 1/64&quot; or 1/32&quot;
deep (I know, woodworker's units, not machinist's units!). Too deep to
polish out with the brake hone... then the bore would look pretty and
leak all around! 

Couldn't find any JBWeld and wasn't sure how epoxy would hold up to the
heat cycling, so I filled it with Permatex hardening gasket sealer. Then
I figured I would use the brake hone to make it round &amp; use the Permatex
Hylomar HPF sealer when I reassemble, unless I sleep on it and dig the
gasket sealer out to use something different. That's pretty likely to
happen, maybe look for some high-heat epoxy.

Good night everyone.

PS. I wonder if it's just coincidence that my Netscape spell check came
up with 'putrid' as a replacment for 'pushrod'...
