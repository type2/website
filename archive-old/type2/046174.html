Subject: [T2] Paint, Electrics and a daft idea.

Ashley is progressing to the fitting out stage so I have lots more
questions-

Is there any reason why I shouldn't paint the inside of the poptop with
normal gloss paint ? It is the rough side of the fibreglass and could do
with a freshen up. I know that there is probably the propper fibreglass
concoction for this but is there any reason why normal gloss paint should
cause any problem ? (does the fibreglass need to breath or anything ?)

I have wired up the spotlights on the bumper and very nice they are to.
Proper job with a relay and everything (OK so the PO fitted that but it
works well). Just wondered if VW ever made a spotlight switch for any
vehicles. I don't think I need these lights working most of the time and it
is an extra drain on the battery when using main beam. If there is a switch,
what does it look like and has anyone got one they want to get rid of ? I
will put in a normal switch if required  but a *propper* one would be nicer.
While we are on the subject of electrics, why do the bulbs that light up the
speedo etc. have green see-through covers on them ? Surely this cuts down
the light.

Finally, a daft idea. The space under the seats seems to be wasted. Has
anyone worked out a way of getting water tanks in there ? It looks
impossible but just in case....

Thanks very much.
