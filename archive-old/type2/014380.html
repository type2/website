Subject: Cool Tin


Oh, another thing I noticed when I climbed under this 1969 
transporter last night was that the tin pieces which
go from the heat exchanger to the engine sump on the 
bottom of the engine, in addition to the rear (RIR) tin
peices which sit between the head and the muffler are missing.

In their place is tin shrouding on the head itself, which
looks like it might be the infamous type-3 &quot;Cool Tin&quot;.

Obviously, I'm more a fan of the stock tin setup, but I'm wondering
if putting the stock tin on and leaving the &quot;Cool Tin&quot; -- or whatever
tin is on the head itself -- will be a problem.  

(All this given at I don't want to pull the engine and pull
the &quot;cool tin&quot; as I'm lazy).

I'm thinking having all that tin on shouldn't have a
negative effect, although I'm wary that the &quot;Cool Tin&quot;
affects airflow over the heads in ways I can't anticipate
and that perhaps the other tin is left off for a reason.


thoughts, anyone?
