Subject: Westy Light Switches

This is for those who were not fortunate enough to have gotten some of the
correct (for 68-72) interior light switches from list member Bill Divers.  I
have been using a switch from Radio Shack - part number 275-1565B, &quot; Push
On/Push Off Soft Feel Switch, SPST, 3A, 125 VAC.  While this item does not
look at all like the original (the visible part is about 1/2&quot; square, black,
with a square red pushbutton) it installs in the light housing without
requiring you to drill out the hole or otherwise modify the housing, and it
works really well.  You will have to solder the wires to the switch
terminals.
