Subject: Re: [T2] 71 heat control levers

Paul, just find the levers. They go in with enough of a friction fit that
they wont come out or vibrate. Trust me, its bad enough getting them out, I
wouldnt ever want to put those little buggers back in.

Subject: [T2] 71 heat control levers


Hi Folks,
  I've been laying on the front floor of our '71 wondering how to fix the
broken heat control levers in my dash.  The only parts yard around here with
buses doesn't have any for an early bay.  The metal levers are broken off
just above the dash and of course there are no knobs on them.   So I'm
wondering;
    1.  does anyone have a pair of these levers to sell me?
    2.  what do I use in place of the plastic rivet that holds the 2 pieces
of the lever together?  The dealer says the OEM part is no longer available
and I dont see anything in the usual catalogs.
