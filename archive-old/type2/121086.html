Subject: rocker spacers - was Re: [T2] Re:  Cost Effectiveness of Points
  Replacement Conversions?

&gt; grinder and have him see if he can find a difference in the grinds between the two type4 cams. He can't
&gt; because they are identical. BTDT! Look in the Bentley, only the auto trans cam has a cast ring on it denoteing
&gt; it is for an auto trans engine. All you need are a good cam to start with and then swap the lifters, pushrods,
&gt; and the spacers between the rockers. I use very good USED VW lifters to keep the metal hardness the same. I do

My 78 used to have hydro lifters and I switched to solids.  I got a new 
cam, lifters, and switched out the rods.  What's the difference in the 
spacers?

thanks,
Mike
