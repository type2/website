Subject: Re: [T2] overheated bad

Okay, maybe it was foaming.. hot air escaping.
I see what you mean about boiling oil.

Which is good cause that would be wayy to hot.
Tomorrow I am renting a dolly (not a toy) and hauling
it back arseend forwards.

Then Ill take the advice of drink beer, read manual
and umm fix.. yah thats it.

 &gt; Perhaps there is a lot of water mixed in that is boiling off or something 
else that's not engine oil?

...or maybe it's just foaming?

I've been thinking about this a bit and that's all i can think of...
