These were both 76-79 tanks. 075 M was designated M157 (the evaporative fuel
recovery system). The m-code is actually a master that covers a number of
emissions control features.

This tank only went up to 75 according to my fiche.
 
&gt; Why the change in January 1973?  The fuel gauge sender changed from a
&gt; 5 screw tube style to a twist-on lever style.  Trivia note - The fuel
&gt; gauge changed at the same time to be compatible with the different
&gt; sender - they are NOT interchangeable (actually they won't read
&gt; correctly with the different sender).

I always wondered if the gauge was compatible. Thanks Jim.
