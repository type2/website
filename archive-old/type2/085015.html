Subject: Re: [T2] Wiring a tow lighting harness into the bus

I may just surrender and do that. But I thought I would be wooseying out if
I did that.

Heck, a $49 light kit, and I am &quot;On the Road&quot;... why mess with it?

OK, I'm convinced.
Thanks to all.

&gt; Chuck,
&gt;
&gt; IMHO, you are trying to make things difficult for yourself.
&gt;
&gt; Trying to tie the lights and such into the bus wiring is going to be
&gt; difficult.....be easier to buy magnetic tow lights and wire and plug
&gt; them  into the car you are towing with.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, dave

&gt;&gt;  Need some insight on how to wire the lights of a 79 loaf to be towed.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I would prefer not to use external tow lights. I have searched the
&gt;&gt; archive and cannot find any suggestions, so here goes:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   Where do I hook into the running lights, brake lights and turn
&gt;&gt;   signals?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   At the fuse box? Or at the switch? or ....? Any special hints or
&gt;&gt;   advice?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   Any guidance would be appreciated.
