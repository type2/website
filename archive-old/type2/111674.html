Subject: Re:Won't idle

Rob,
 
    There are a couple of places to look. If this is a 30 PICT-2, there 
is a pilot jet that is connected to the electric pilot jet cut-off 
valve that screwed into the side of the carb. I have always seen these 
clogged with trash every time your idle starts to go. I take a fine thread 
of wire and clean the pilot jet out, then blow some air threw the jet. 
Make sure there isn't any trash in the carb also.
