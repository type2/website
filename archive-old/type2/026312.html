	[Crick, Bill ]  For what they are worth, my comments are
interspersed 
&gt; Hello again everybody,
&gt;   
&gt;  Don and i ran all the tasts that we could to figure it 
&gt; out, and he suspects the ECU. Here's what we did in a nutshell:
&gt;   We had good spark at the coil and all cylinders, we had good fuel
&gt; pressure. 
&gt; 
	 
&gt;  so on to checking injectors and other stuff. We didnt 
&gt; have a multi tester, so we did what we could with a test light. What we
&gt; did 
&gt; was arc the tester from the positive contact to the negative ground of the
&gt; 
&gt; injector wires. I hypothesised that the light should come on with all
&gt; twelve 
&gt; volts as the engine was cranked, but it only generated a slight pulsatiing
&gt; 
&gt; glow. 
	[Crick, Bill ]  They should pulse like this. The question is how
bright?
	If they are really dim, it could be that the connections to, or the
ballast 
	resistors are bad . 
&gt;  As the same thing was done to the cold start valve, the glow was much 
&gt; more intense for the first half second, but then cut back to a light glow 
&gt; also. 
	[Crick, Bill ]  This should glow the same brightness for about 10
seconds on
	a COLD engine the first try. Subsequent trys, or a warm engine can
reduce, or eliminate this.
	It should not come on at all in a hot engine.
&gt; Don suspected that the valve wasn' t operating 
&gt; properly, so we deposited some gasoline into the air distributer through
&gt; the 
&gt; intake hose. This did absolutely nothing, and i was left in a state of 
&gt; dumb-dum.
	[Crick, Bill ]  Why didn't it start? Can you get it to fire, or
start on 'starting fluid'?
	If not why not?
&gt;    Don suggests that since it seems to be a failure to start and run, and
&gt; not 
&gt; poor running, that it is likely to be the ECU. It may be getting mixed up
&gt; and 
&gt; sending bogus information to the components. 
	[Crick, Bill ]   The ECU only sends out one kind of information:
	It sends pulses to actuate the injectors by grounding one side of
the injectors.
	It sends the same pulses to all 4 injectors at the same time.

	Hope this is some help
