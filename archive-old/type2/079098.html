&gt; okay, I've got a 76 automatic, and the accel cable broke, apparently the 
&gt; cable links to some kind of linkage on the automatic transmission, it is 

correct

&gt; broken between there and the pedal, so I pulled out the old cable, and now I 
&gt; can't figure out how to remove the part by the transmission, I'm sick of 
&gt; busting my knuckles on it, and there seems to be no help in the bently on it, 

actually it is in Bentley in one of the screwiest places, check the
chapter on Fuel Injection, job 6.4 pg 30

&gt; so someone please tell me the trick! I have not even looked at the front 

it is a cup that fits onto a ball on the linkage, it frequently siezes (ok
I've not seen one not seized)  to get it off hit it with just about any
and every solvent realeaser you have.  then I have found that a minature
pickle fork (home  made) to get it out.  it is in one of those you can't
get to it places.  it is a REAL PITA, and worse the ball will break off
the lever real easy and it is next to impossible to fix then with the
tranny still in the bus.   part pulls out from the rear not the front. and
that makes it harder still.

fortunately the front is fairly easy and straight forward. lossen a lock
bolt and slide the shaft out

Ask me how I learned all this  BTDT..
