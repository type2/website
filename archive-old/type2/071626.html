Maybe less rusty for a while, but I bet you'll see it again. It may be 
months, even a year, but the rust will return. There is no substitute for 
cutting out the rusted metal and welding in new ( expensive, I know ). I'm 
starting to see rust poke through areas I coated with Corroless almost two 
years ago, and even though the Corroless kept the rust from spreading, it 
aint a permanent fix. And, I assume you're talking about that expandable foam 
you get in cans at hardware stores? It would seem to me that stuff would be 
more likely to trap moisture and promote rust.   Jeff S.
