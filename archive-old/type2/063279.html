Subject: A Potpourri of stuff

Hi, I have been away for the past ten days and boy did I learn my lesson.  I got in today, calmly walked to my computor and went to check my E mail,  I HAD 730 MESSAGES,  It took almost an hour to load them.  Thus, the first question:

What about those of us that occasionally take extended trips.  Is there a way to temporarily drop from the list, and just recive the digest when you return.  I like ya'll but damn that is just too much reading.  : )


It is just now beginning to feel like autumn here in Georgia, and the bus is getting abit cooler.  I know the heating system is not the best in VW's, thus the second question:

What is your best suggestion for alternate heat?

This past week I was in Savannah and Miami, the latter the less pleasurable of the two.  I drove the Mothership to Savannah (she performed magnificiently, and got many stares from people on the interstate.  Thus the third question:

What kind of gas mileage should I expect, the engine is a pancake 2000 and I have custom camp interior which of course adds some extra weight?

      While in Savannah I camped one nite at Skidaway Island State Park, very nice place.  When I pulled into the camping area I was looking for a siter when I noticed a Vanagon Camper.  As I passed the people in it (an older couple) waved and took notice of &quot;the Mothership&quot;.  I waved and went on and found my site for the nite.
        A few minutes after I got settled in, an elderly gentleman came riding in on a bike.  He rode right up to me and started speking his best english.  It was a noble attempt, but we ended up using mostly sign language to communicate.  I recognized him as the man with the Vanagon Camper.  He and his wife were from Hamburg, Germany.  they had been coming to America every year for the past ten.  They would load there bus on a freighter, (which also rents cabins, much to my surprise) and come to America and tour it and it's bordering countries.
        I sat and talked with them a while, we looked at his bus, and he explained certain things I didn't know about the watercooled VW.  He had the greatest bike rack.  It bolted to the vehicle, had extended post for hanging your bike on, but alos had a platform you could raise or lower according to what you were hauling.
        We were looking at his sticker collection, I saw one from Hamburg, it was a print of a castle with Hamburg written across the bottom.  I commented on it and before I knew it he was going thru the van looking for a spare one he had.  He gave it to me to place on my bus.  
        In talking I found out that Heir Robert Mueller was 83 years old, his wife Erika was 79, but she didn't look a day over 50.  He had been a seargant in the Third Riech during world war two, and had been stationed at the Russian front.  He eventually became a POW of the Americans and remained that for the last two years of the war.  
        He had seen Hitler in person, and said that the one thing he noticed was that he was always figety and nervous acting.  he said he joined the service because he was fighting for his country, not for Hitler.

Anyway, thats the story and some questions for you to reply to if you wanna.
