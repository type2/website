Agreed, but isn't proper timing just as important. I think I have damaged
more engines by not timing them properly than I have by not adjusting
valves. (I know how to do that right, but I'm not sure I've yet mastered
the art of timing.) In some ways I'm the &quot;idiot&quot; Muir was writing to. I've
only recently come to understand that over-advancing the timing causes
your engine to run HOT, which can cause your oil to break down, your heads
to warp, and your valves to fry. I dropped a valve seat on #1 most
recently (should 260 degrees cause you to drop a valve seat?). 

My engine's now on the garage floor in pieces. Unfortunately, I also
discovered that this engine suffers from the same thrust facing damage my
last engine died from, so now I'm looking at rebuilding an engine I just
picked up for $100...which has good DP heads and seems to have good
end-play. One of these days I'll have to visit a machine shop and get one
of these cases machined.

Next time I'm going to pay way more attention to my timing...and
temps...and I'll carry a spare head with me too.
