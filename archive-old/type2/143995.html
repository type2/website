Subject: Re: [T2]Trailer hitches from walmart?

I am one of the happy Jamie Rivers bus hitch owners. 
It was a slam dunk.  But you must go out and purchase
the four M10x1.5x30 bolts on your own.  But purchasing
the bolts was harder than installing the hitch.
   
It fits.  Looks good.  Works well.  I got the
&quot;receiver&quot; model, so I needed to buy a ball and ball
mount.  Again, not a challenge.  But the shiny new
trailer hitch upstages the scabby paint job.
