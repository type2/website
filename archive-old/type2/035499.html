&lt;&lt;Question for the list, where does the aux battery go in a 74 westy and how

do the fridge and electric water pump work? Do they run off the aux

battery? Mine dont run off 110 so I'm thinking i need the battery.....

Todd,
If you have the deluxe Westfalia, your aux battery is located on the left 
side in the engine compartment.  Your battery relay should be mounted right 
inside the opening on the left.  Its a small silver box with wires attached 
to the bottom.

There is a switch on the side of your frig that changes it from 12V to 110V.  
You also need to turn the thermostat.  If you don't have a switch and 
thermostat, then you might have a non deluxe model and you just have an ice 
box.  Do you have a stove and propane tank?

Your water pump should run off the main battery.  Only the frig will run off 
the aux.
