Hello again list members....
I got a nice little mig welder for Christmas and am about to begin some
much needed rust repair on the '72 Westy.  One area of concern is the
slider door bottom track (the surface the roller rolls on), the rocker
panels and the holes they have grown.  I've been pricing that bottom track
piece and it seems to be over $120.00!!!!  And the right outer rocker is
about $30 w/o shipping?? What I'm asking is: Are there any list members out
there with a parts bus or a replacement panel stockpile that would be
willing to sell me the parts in question. Used is fine as long as it is
pretty rust free.  If you could cut that whole inner/outer rocker door
track right out of there  I'm sure I could dissect it and get what I
need...... For a reasonable used price??? Also that danged roller that
rusts and falls off allowing your friends and family to graciously pull
your slider door out of the track and on to the ground...... Do any of you
know where to get that thing? ...... Reasonable?
	I may be barking up a dead tree here but I figured I'd try,  I know I've
got stuff lying around here I'd be glad to get rid of.
Thanks!!

Also need some: 
driver and pass. floor sections
driver side rocker panel
pieces behind front wheels that rust out and leak into rockers
area in front of rear wheel wells on the bottom
