Subject: Re: [T2] Muffle That!

[..]As per my previous post, I've been using a bug (2 outlet w/ peashooters)
muffler on my 71 westy for the entire 16 years I've owned it.  I never could
understand the reason for the bus (1 outlet) muffler, but the exhaust in the
slipstream issue makes sense.  I suppose you could install 2 bus tailpipe
assemblies onto a bug muffler, but the best insurance against fumes is probably
to make sure that the rear hatch and engine hatch door seals are in good
condition, and the doors are closed when the bus is under way.  I've never
noticed fumes in the bus, except when I had problems with muffler to heat
exchanger air side leaks.  I think the back pressure difference between the two
setups is negligable, since the inner diameter of the peashooters is quite a bit
smaller than the ID of the single outlet tailpipe assembly.

&gt; I believe the beetle (2-tip) muffler is not recommended for the bus in that
&gt; the exhaust is directly behind the bus, creating a vortex of noxious fumes
&gt; that remains with the (back of the) bus whilst moving.  The bus tailpipe may
&gt; solve this by discharging the exhaust a little closer to the so-called
&gt; slipstream.  ....
