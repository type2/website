&gt; I was just driving my '81 automatic-transmissiong vanagon down the
&gt; road, when I noticed almost simultaneously two things.  First, a small
&gt; puff of smoke caught my eye out the rearview, and second, the engine
&gt; seemed to be revving a bit higher than seemed right.  By the following
&gt; block, the engine was *definitely* revving high, and the van wasn't
&gt; actually accelerating much.  So I coasted to a parking spot and hopped
&gt; out, to find the street covered in AT fluid, which was dribbling
&gt; profusely from roughly where the transmission and engine connect.
&gt;
&gt; So $60 later, the van is parked outside my home, and I have to ponder
&gt; next moves.  Any suggestions?  Is it likely that I'd be able to pull
&gt; the transmission, replace a few gaskets, put it back together, and be
&gt; good to go?  If not, what are my options, keeping in mind that spending
&gt; money really isn't one of them :(  Pay somebody money I don't have to

sounds like you may have lucked out (relatively speaking) it is very
possible that you just blew a seal..tranny fluid leaked out, you get no go
without tranny blood.

&gt; fix the tranny?  Pay somebody money I don't have for a stick-shift
&gt; tranny, and drop that in?

you don't even want to think about how much work that is, fortunately the
late 010 tranny you have is still avaliable to get parts for, not to
mention a used tranny is not that hard to find, while they are basically
the same tranny a vanagon and bay auto tranny are not interchangable.

&gt;  Give up and sell the van, in not-running
&gt; condition, and lose all the work I put into rebuilding the engine over
&gt; last summer?

I wouldn't do that, (if you do talk to me about that engine)

&gt;  Buy lottery tickets and hope?

uh huh,,,,....
&gt;
&gt; Any tests I should run before making a hasty decision?  I have Haynes,
&gt; Muir, and Chilton, but don't have a copy of Bentley.  The library does,
&gt; though, so I could photocopy a few relevant pages if necessary...

get the Bentley, it is almost mandatory for the tranny. if you can find
one get the auto tranny trouble shooting manual.

one quick test, fill the tranny with fluid, to the full mark, start it up
and see if you can move it in all gears (before the fluid leaks out) put
something under the tranny to collect the fluid

if it goes then it is probably just a seal....

good luck
Bob
