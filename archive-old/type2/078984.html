&gt; coulod also leak a bit?

not likely the valve seat, these are fairly new rebuilds and I had em
interfered with on the seats.

crack!?  scary but makes sense, guess I can look down into the tin with a
mirror and flash and see if I find something obvious.._dot_can't imagine it
being welded without being removed eh?   well at least I have a pair of
spare heads.....

&gt; &gt; oh great and wise list......
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I went out to my 78 2Liter (stock) auto tranny bus this afternoon to try
&gt; &gt; and track down a small engine miss....never found the miss I guess because
&gt; &gt; it is so intermittent, but found something else that has me totally
&gt; &gt; mystified.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; #3  when cranked sounds like the valves aren't closing, you hear an air
&gt; &gt; rush when it compresses.  HOWEVER, the compression tester shows it right
&gt; &gt; on the money and within a lb or so of the other cyl....?  if the cyl leaks
&gt; &gt; how does it compress??   was unable to do a leakdown test, for unrelated
&gt; &gt; reasons.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;   now the hsssst hsssst hsssst occurs on every crank when running  the
&gt; &gt; starter, (I know it is #3, remove the spark plug and it vanishes) but
&gt; &gt; engine starts right up, you can still hear it at idle, but once the RPM
&gt; &gt; gets up the sound goes away....
