Subject: WI and Megasquirt

I spoke with my friend the Megasquirt guru yesterday about WI.  He has 
built a daughter card which adds an additional controllable output channel.

This means one could use the coldstart injector, normally discarded by 
megasquirters, (with suitable water pump and tank) in a controllable 
fashion and pump whatever the optimal quantity of water would be 
directly into the intake plenum.  The volume of water intake should rise 
and fall proportionately to the fuel being delivered I should think.  If 
a water/fuel ratio could be established programming the megasquirt would 
be a snap. If the optimal ratio varied with different conditions of 
intake air temp, manifold pressure (vacuum), CHT, O-two sensor V, and 
rpm, then that can be programmed as well!

Of course, no experimentation from me for awhile (see previous message 
about rebuilding...)
