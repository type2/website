Subject: Re: [T2] Spark plugs and cht sensor ?

Tom said:


 Been reading up on installing my cht sensor before I put the tin over #3. Most
folks seem to recommend using NKG plugs so there is a little more clearance
for the sensor. I have always used Bosch plugs so I have no Idea about the
quality of NKG. Tried searching the archives for nkg and only got 10
responses. 6 of them were duplicates. Anyone out there use NKG plugs? Whats
your opinion? GOOD? BAD? INDIFFERENT?

You will probably have better search results if you look for NGK.......:)

I don't use them at all. We see horrible results when people put them in Mercedes. 
They break down under a load [when accelerating] all the time, even right out of the box!
They work fine in motorcycles. 
Your mileage may vary....... others seem to like them.
