Ok, all this tech talk about volts and milliamps and what kind of meter
to buy -- h_at_ll, I paid $20 for the one I've got, and I've got about $5
worth of knowledge to apply to it. And this after 10 months of VW
ownership, where I've just (finally) mastered the concept that volts is
how much power your battery is putting out and continuity tells you if a
circuit is complete or not (when that's a good thing or not, I'm still
not sure).

Since the spark I'm getting at the ground strap to chassis connection is
really dinky, I'm just not going to worry about it for now. I've
disconnected the ground terminal on the battery and I'm leaving it at
that for now.

This is all waaaay over my head. Bear in mind that I am standing at the
very bottom of a very steep learning curve and would just like very
basic, step-by-step diagnostic instructions to tell me where to pick up
after Muir says to take the fuses out one by one (&quot;and then what
happened?&quot;).

I'm going to ruminate on (or, as Muir would say, &quot;grok&quot;) all the input
I've received this evening and hopefully in a few days it will coalesce
into something that makes sense. Right now my brain is just glazing
over.

All I know is the batteries went dead after I replaced the coil in the
desert last month (I've switched back to the old one), and they always
worked fine before. BTW, the coil is what serves as the isolator between
my main and auxiliary batteries: key on = main battery; key off =
auxiliary battery. Somehow it seems the replacement coil got that
confused. I have no idea how or why. Ever since then, I've been in
battery h_at_ll.

P.S. I just measured 119V in my home outlet, so I guess my meter is
still good.
