&gt; &gt; Because they are always moving up and down through thinner and thicker

&gt; 
&gt; Which makes me wonder...could a person retrofit an airplane carb. to a VW 
&gt; engine and rig it so that either mechanically or electrically, you could 
&gt; adjust the mixture?  That would be neat...albeit a pain in the rear at 
&gt; times..to adjust for altitude changes...
&gt; 


FWIW,
SU carburetors are self adjusting to altitude (to a degree) because they 
operate on a vacuum principle, and if you use the HD model SUs, you can 
use the choke mechanism to adjust the mixture with quite a bit of 
precision. SUs are very easy to work on also (despite all the rumors most 
people spread around about them) I suppose I am  one of the only 
mechanics though  that has ever thought of them as easy to use, but they 
would work nicely

Just a thought!
