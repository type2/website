Subject: instalation of side louverd windows.

I need some input on how to get the side louvered windows re-installed. I have
pushed pulled pried slid,wedged etc and I can seem to get the new (Bus Depot)v
seal to collapse enough to set correctly.I have even sprayed the rubber seal
with silicone to lubricate it enough to &quot;slide&quot; back in (NO LUCK). I am sure
it has nothing to do with the seal just the installer. Please provide any and
all suggestions.
