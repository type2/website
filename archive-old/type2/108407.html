Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch cable install

From: &quot;Richard Atwell&quot; &lt;ratwell_at_mac_dot_com&gt;
&gt; It's there to protect the cable after the clevis pin as it goes through to
gap in the frame to where it enters the long metal tube that guides it
through to the back.

Thanks.  I guessed as much, but didn't want to hurt anything.  I'll double
check to make sure that I got it right tomorrow morning.

The cable that broke snapped about 12&quot; from the trannie end of the run.  Had
the whole thing installed and ready to go in about 30 minutes.  Made a run
and tightened the wing nut up a tad when we stopped.  Shifts smooth and with
less effort than before.  Which isn't surprising considering the condition
of the old cable.

Had a surprise when I removed the clevis pin.  As in it wasn't there.  The
last installer had used a cotter pin and a split hollow pin together to hold
the clevis to the clutch lever.  Thanks to whoever it was that suggested it,
I'd purchased the clip along with the cable.  I'm picking up another cable
and clip in a few weeks as spares, too.

It cost $9.00 for the clip and cable, and 30 minutes of my time.  It took
$800.00 and not having my car for 10 weeks (had to pay it off before they'd
release it) to fix the clutch on the Sentra.  I'm sooooo happy. :O)

&gt; I think the little white piece with the part number marked on it is just
for identification. I could be wrong but my old cable didn't have one.

Mine didn't have one either.
