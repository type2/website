I have the same problem with my '72 Westy, too much gas is being forced down 
the filler thingy to fast and it makes the pump think its full and clicks 
off, you just can't squeeze the pump at full throttle like you do with a new 
car, you have to fill it up slowly.

&lt;&lt; I have a '77 Kombi that I'm having problems getting gas into right now.
 
 When I'm fueling it up, the gas pump keeps kicking off like my Bus is
 full of gas when in fact it's NOT. It's almost empty and I really need
 to get gas in it bad. 
 
 What can I do? &gt;&gt;
