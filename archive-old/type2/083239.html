Subject: Tuning AFM with Oxygen sensor 

Hi Guys,

The exhaust on my '78 is finally air-tight enough to use an Oxygen sensor =
for tuning the mixture. My goal is not to wire up a a gauge to the sensor. =
I'm more interested in setting the mixture with my voltmeter to improve =
the gas mileage then removing it and plugging the hole.

I have the sensor in and I have played with adjusting the spring. I have a =
few questions:

1. Is is better to adjust the spring under load (i.e. while driving) or =
with the bus stopped?
2. Should I adjust the idle mixture before or after adjusting the cruising =
speed mixture?

I figured that I should adjust cruising speed mixture (the spring) first =
and that I should do it with the bus driving. I did manage to lean it =
some, but I found that based on load, throttle position and speed, my =
mixture did vary. I got it leaned to about 650 mv at the sensor most of =
the time, but there were some times that the mixture would go to 100 mv =
for a little while. Also, under full throttle, it would still go to 800 =
mv.=20

3. Is this normal? Should I worry that it sometimes goes to 100 mv?=20

Thanks much,

Mark
'78 'blue bus'
