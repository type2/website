Subject: temp sensor thread size

Evening,
I  have another question I hope someone can answer. I have a 78 Westy
with a stock 2.0 and the threads for the temp
sensor on the head are buggered up. I can't get the sensor to sit flat.
What size is it so I can get a
tap and clean up the threads.
Thanks,

Bill M
