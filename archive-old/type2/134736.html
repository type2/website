Subject: Re: [T2] 55 mph speed limit

I guess that I'd an odd out here.  I drive the speed limit because of my
faith.  Granted, I'm not a saint, but I try.

In the Bible (oh-oh, the &quot;B&quot; word!) Christians are exhorted to obey their
government unless the government insists that you do something that clearly
goes against the Scriptures.  The speed limit falls into the &quot;obey&quot;
catagory.  So I drive the speed limit.

But my question for those who fly the swift wind of speed is this...

What do you do when you have to make an emergency manuvuer at 85+?!  A
flying bread box is still a flying bread box!  I'd be terrified to think of
making a violent manuvuer at over 70 mph, let alone anything higher.

My family is more important to me than getting &quot;there&quot; a few minutes
earlier.  At 60 mph, with no stops, you get 60 miles in, well, an hour
(duh).  At 85 miles per hour, you get there in 42 minutes, a savings of 18
minutes.  Theorhetically, on a trip of 1000 miles (at 60 mph) you'd get
there in 16.5 hours.  At 85 you'd get there in 11.7 hours.

You've saved roughly 5 hours travel time, but why do we drive buses in the
first place?  To get there, or to get there without blurring the scenery as
we drive by it?  And while at any speed over 35 mph, you stand a good chance
of severe bus damage and injury in an accident, at 85 mph you're almost
guarentted a totalled bus and death.  Hmm... has anyone survived an accident
at 70 mph+?

I'm not critizing those who choose to push their buses to the limits (and
sometimes beyond).  I'm just concerned about my own and my family's safety.
