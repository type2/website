Subject: Bolt &amp; Nut Sizes -- 2nd Post

Hi Folks,

My last posting got no responses, so I'm posting again.

1979 Camper with 1977 Engine
Does anybody know or know where I can find the following bolt &amp; nut sizes 
and thread pitches?

Muffler Bolts - bolts, nuts, washers?  Easy to fake a replacement, but I'd 
like to get it right.
Tinware Screws - hex head or flat head
E-brake Cable Nut - Bus Depot says NLA, anybody have an extra for sale?  
Otherwise I'll just use a nut and a locknut.

Thanks in advance for any help, suggestions, or response.
