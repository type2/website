Subject: Re: [T2] help identify rear noise please...

Actualy no, I haven't noticed the noise at all while turning. I notice it 
most going at very low speeds, like 1st gear speed.

&gt;As I understand it a rebuilt comes with everything. Install it and drive 
&gt;it. The gears I am mentioning are the spider gears. Do these noises happen 
&gt;during curves - or at any time the left and right side rear tires would be 
&gt;turning at different rates?
