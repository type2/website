Subject: Re: [T2] 74 bus questions (1600cc engine)

This thread is sure to get al and jake stirred up
again :)

&gt; I am looking at a 74 westy (with) a 71 dp 1600
in it. There is no rear tin...Does anybody know
of a source 

I hope it's not fried already.  Good news is 1600
parts are 1/2 to 1/3 of type IV parts.  

http://www.creativecarcraft_dot_com/notforbug.htm

The european guys have access to genuine VW tin
used.  Late bay busses had 1600's in europe.  

&gt; If there is somebody in
&gt; colorado with an extra T4 engine and tranny
&gt; that are
&gt; correct for this bus I will possibly trade 2
&gt; running
&gt; 71 engines and a 71 tranny. 

Too bad you're not closer.  I have exactly what
you want and you have exactly what I want.

How did they rig up the rear engine hanger on the
bus.  I was looking at a 71 today and am not sure
how the 71 mustache bar would fit without major
fabrication to the 74 body?

Peace and blessings,
