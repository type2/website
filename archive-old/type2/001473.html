Tim,

     According to the Bentley &amp; my emission sticker, it should be 7.5BTDC.
The 5ATDC is for 79 Cal cars only.  Thanks anyway.

Pat
79 Std.

&gt;
&gt; I'm under the impression that the proper timing for a '79 with a stock
&gt; distributor is supposed to be 5 degrees ATDC as in AFTER top dead center.
&gt; I don't have a manual in front of me, but thats where I've always timed my
&gt; '79 (Cal emissions) per the manual.
