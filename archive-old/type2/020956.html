Subject: [T2] RE: Sliding Door


&gt;  &gt;I was checking to make sure my all my door locks
&gt;  &gt;worked on my 71 bus.  I went to lock my sliding door
&gt;  &gt;and it locked fine.  When I went to unlock it, uh oh.
&gt;  &gt;I can't get it unlocked? Does any one know how I can
&gt;  &gt;get it unlocked and what is wrong with it?

The helpful Mr. Stoermer is on the trail of your problem, Nick. My post sat 
unsent, but expands a bit. Here it is, a bit late but sincere nonetheless:

My 71 won't unlock with the exterior key if the *inside lever* is thrown to 
lock. Likewise, you cannot unlike my door from the inside if the key has 
locked the outside.

Also, if the door is not closed completely (sliding door handle *raised* to 
the click), all bets are also off. I feel sure it is one or a combination of 
these things that has you befuddled.

FWIW: I like a locked sliding door when sleeping, but one through which I can 
escape should need be (visiting hornet or Brown Recluse perhaps). I therefore 
always *unlock* the key, and *lock* the lever from inside. Sometimes I forget 
and get up to corect the situation--which I feel important.

Fortunately, no such problem exists with the rear hatch, which can be unlocked 
from inside regardless of the keyed status. Good for me, bad for transporting 
curious kiddos in my 71 (which has yet to happen).

FWIW, the sliding door (on a 71, at least) actually has two separate and 
independant locks, one inside and one outside.  The outside one works 
with the key only, and when locked, has &quot;teeth&quot; that engage slots in the 
periphery of the hole in the door sheetmetal, through which the handle 
shaft passes.  When the teeth engage the slots, the handle shaft, and 
thus both handles, are prevented from rotating and opeing the door.  The 
inside lock, which works with the lever only, has an actuating rod from 
the lever to the lock at the rear edge of the door.

Question on the rear hatch:  My 71 has no inside release mechanism that 
I am aware of.  Is/was that an option and can it be retrofitted?
