Subject: [T2] Rocker Arms


&gt; I think the part number 021 101 397 is the right part number because
someone
&gt; on the vwvortex gave me the same number.  I went to my local dealer as a
first
&gt; step.  The guy at the parts counter broke out into laughter when I asked
if
&gt; they sold those parts anymore.  Then I asked him to look up the part
number
&gt; and after looking through ETKA for the longest time he could only come up
with
&gt; the part number for the rocker arms or something else.

When I was looking for these recently my first &quot;stop&quot; (via the phone) was my
local VW dealer.  They didn't have them and didn't seem interested in even
trying to help.  After calling a couple of other dealers I finally got a
part guy that remembered the air-cooled Volkswagens and he offered to tap
into the VW computers to see if any were available anywhere; they weren't,
and I ended up getting a couple of used ones from a VW repair place.  The
ETKA shows the part, but doesn't indicate a part number, and a search on the
part number comes up &quot;part number unknown.&quot;
