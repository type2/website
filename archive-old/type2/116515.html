Actually, getting the cover on and off the bus is easy, even with one
person.

To remove, roll/fold the cover from both ends toward the middle of the bus,
leaving the sides hanging, until the rolled/folded cover is about 4 feet
long.  Then, roll/fold both sides toward the middle of the bus and slide the
cover off.  I use a piece of rope to tie the cover from the side grommet
holes, to keep the wind from blowing it off.  Leaving the rope tied to one
grommet hole helps pull the cover from one side of the bus to the other, and
you can then wrap the rope around the rolled/folded cover to store it.

To put the cover on, unrap the rope, set the still rolled/folded cover in
the middle of the bus in the same orientation as when you took it off.  Use
the rope to pull it roughly to the center of the bus and unroll/unfold the
sides, the unroll/unfold the ends, and it will be close to being in the
correct position, after which you can tug as necessary to get where you want
it.
