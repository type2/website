Subject: RE: [T2] The answers or conjectures re the Electric Beetle 
  Engine

&gt; engine!!!!  In europe some small car work on compressed air!!  All you need is
&gt; a tank for the compressed air and piston!
&gt;
&gt; Now why an electric engine would need piston like design??

and what would an electric motor do with air intakes and a filter?
maybe it was built by a madman [evil] moohoohoohooohooohoo
