&gt; Hi all,
&gt;    I'm collecting my parts and whits in preparation for assembling my 1979
&gt; 2liter.  Tom Wilson, in his book,  suggests packing the oil pump with grease
&gt; to prevent cavitation at initial start up.  I've never done this before.
&gt;    I'm always willing to learn something new, so I'm calling on the
&gt; collective experience and wisdom of the list.  Do you think I should do this
&gt; or not.  What trials and tribulations have you had with oil pumps after a
&gt; rebuild ?

Paul:
I personally think it's a dumb idea. What does the grease do when it
gets to the oil filter? (but I've never written a book)
I assemble the crank and bearings w/ lubriplate assembly lube (as thin
as you can spread it), lube every moving part/ something, prefill the
oil filter, spin the engine w/o sparkplugs until the oil lite goes out,
(usually 5 seconds or so), put it together and fire it up. This
procedure has worked on the last 200 or so,(the first two had problems.)
Had one Chevy fail after the oil pump pickup fell off the oil pump, but
it had spent a lot of time at 8000 rpm before that (braze those on now).
