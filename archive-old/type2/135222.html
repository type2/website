Subject: Re: [T2] Battery Tray

Seann,

This is the same procedure I just followed:

&gt; I assume that the proper way to replace ones battery tray that is rusting
&gt; is
&gt; to remove the battery/motor/i.e. &quot;stuff in the way&quot;, and then get in there
&gt; with a grinder and mechanically grind all the crud out, then depending on
&gt; preference, clean the surface of finger print oils and such and then weld
&gt; a
&gt; replacement tray in, clean surface to clean surface, then of course comes
&gt; the array of preferences on surface prepping/painting.

Grinding and cleaning was fairly easy. However I put holes in the side of
my bus trying to mig weld the new tray without gas. The replacement trays
for the 74 Westy attatch directly to some pretty thin body metal making it
real easy to scar paint and metal on the exterior of the bus even if you
are welding the interior. After attaching the new tray I sprayed several
coats of rubberized undercoating on both sides of the new tray. Good Luck!

Westy in OR
