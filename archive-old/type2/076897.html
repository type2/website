Subject: Re: [T2] Happy Friday - Bus encounter...

Hi Chris,

I see the same thing here in the Toronto area. When the new beetle came out
the price of aircooled beetles doubled instantly, they were &quot;Collectible&quot;.

They sit unrestored &amp; forgotten until they are too rusty to move and 5 hard
winters later they go off to the crusher without doing anyone any good.

Now buses are going through the same cycle; a rusty wreck that hasn't turned
a wheel in years will still command a US$2K asking price, even though it
will need at least that or more just to get it back on the road. And I have
yet to see a single ad that doesn't mention a recently rebuilt engine.

Well, what can you do? Just be all the more appreciative of what you've got,
that's what. Look after it carefully, tend to its troubles regularly and it
won't wind up in the care of those not-so well-meaning.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Send two like this - sort off.
&gt; 
&gt; One is a salvageable 60's double cab along our route to my parent's house.
&gt; 
&gt; The house it is parked next to has caved in and the woman is in her 70's
&gt; but she is not going to sell this thing 'cause she is going to fix it up -
&gt; and the other 9 cars on the property. The VW is safe though 'cause you
&gt; can't see it for the bushes...
&gt; 
&gt; The other was a '65 Vert that I saw in VA on my trips home from Norfolk. It
&gt; had a few salvageable pieces like the engine lid (I WANTED THAT SO BAD) but
&gt; the rest of the car is a hair from being a big pile of rust.
&gt; 
&gt; He said he would sell it for about $1750. I had to try hard not to giggle
&gt; when he said that!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Hope your raving old bus owner didn't scare your 2 year old. Our son is 2
&gt; on March 30th.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; So yesterday my 2 year old son and I stop at a house not far away where
&gt;&gt; there's a positively
&gt;&gt; annihilated 71 passenger bus out front, it's been there for about a year -
&gt;&gt; the DEADEST bus you've
&gt;&gt; ever seen...this time we peek in to survey the damage and I see, in
&gt;&gt; perfect, showroom shape, one of
&gt;&gt; the few missing parts of my bus, which is the air vent with the armrest on
&gt;&gt; it that screws to the
&gt;&gt; front door panel.  So we go to the door to inquire about buying it maybe,
&gt;&gt; and the CRAZIEST looking
&gt;&gt; hundred and twenty year old man flings open the door and before I can get
&gt;&gt; one word out he yells,
&gt;&gt; &quot;Now dammit!  For the last ****ing time!  I am not selling that
&gt;&gt; bus!  Can't you see I'm fixing it
&gt;&gt; up!?  If one more person asks me if they can buy my bus, I'm gonna shoot
&gt;&gt; em off the porch!!  (He
&gt;&gt; really said this)... SLAM!
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; So...... I guess that's a good thing.  Here's a bus so beat the wrecking
&gt;&gt; yard might not take it, but
&gt;&gt; this old man, he's gonna bring it back to life!
