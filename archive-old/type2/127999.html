Subject: Re: [T2] Jammed starter?

&gt;Our 78 Westy has had problems with the starter. It was rebuilt about &gt;20,000 km ago, and had given us no trouble until a couple weeks ago.

The starter was rebuilt? Or the whole motor?

&gt;We diagnosed the problem as being with the starter gear getting 
&gt;hung up on teeth of the flywheel (as per the Muir Idiot Book

Hmmm, hot start solenoid is a much more common problem (see all the archive discussions) than a jamming starter.

&gt;The second time it happened the above trick didn't work initially.

See above.

&gt;While the behavior indeed sounds like it could have been the hot-start 
&gt;solenoid problem, we have noticed one piece of contrary evidence: &gt;whenever we pushed the bus (in any gear) there was a &gt;repetitive &quot;clunking&quot; (and correspondingly a repetitive &quot;resistance&quot; of &gt;the car to being pushed)

Seems more likely to be the slack being taken up in the transmission between rocking forwards to backwards, and the clunking is just the rest of slack in places like CV joints, etc.

I like the hot start possiblity most.  Besides, the hot start relay fix is cheaper, easier and less time consuming than a starter change.  Why not try it first?  See the article in the library, and the many archive discussions on this topic.
