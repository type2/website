Subject: New seal in, why won't the engine go back in?

Well I got the seal replaced and we raised the engine up and slide it 
forward, the two bottom bolts are in the holes and there is still about an 
inch to go. I cannot find anything the engine is stuck on. We lift the back 
end and push forward and it does not move. The rear support brackets are 
around the frame, but it needs another inch before the holes line up. This 
is my first engine installation, so I figure I am not doin something right. 
Any ideas?
