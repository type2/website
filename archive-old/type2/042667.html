Subject: WI VW event, radio wanted

 Hi folks,
  
  Our local VW club is having a picnic this Saturday in Oshkosh WI. Everyone 
is meeting at noonish in Menominee park by the big pavilion.  All VWs 
welcome.  BYO food and drink.  Any questions,  p mail me.

   Also- anyone have a FUNCTIONAL VW radio that they want to sell? My bus 
came complete with an internally fried unit.  Not fussy- just need one that 
works and will go into my dash without mods to the dash itself. I don't wanna 
do aftermarket, or I'm afraid it might dissappear. Can be AM or AM FM
    Keep in mind that VWs are few and far between up here.
  Thanks
  Brian
