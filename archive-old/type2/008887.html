Hi John,   Jamie ,  and All that are going  
I thought i'd touch base with you for info on this trek.
It looks like a very good route for me, but i have a couple of 
Hitchhickers to pick up in Front Royal that will determine my 
departure time from there.
Is this plan coming together as of this writting?
If it is still a go and We can manage to make it for the 6ish Friday, 
i would love to join in.
Can you get back to me re:times of others joining etc to see if i can 
fit your schedule.
Thanks  Jamie Rivers, Ontario CANADA. 519.623.8495

Busses Briefly on the Blue Ridge
&gt;
&gt;OK folks, still wondering if DC area types want to form up on the 
way down
&gt;to the list campout a couple weekends hence.  I have a nice scenic 
thought
&gt;if anyone is interested.
&gt;
&gt;I figure meet up Friday (time TBD) on I66 at Front Royal VA, proceed 
over
&gt;and down I81 to Staunton, then I64 till we hit the Blue Ridge 
Parkway to
&gt;keep a bit of the spirit alive, Blue Ridge down to US 501, US 501 to 
US29 at
&gt;Lynchburg, then US29 all the way down to Greensboro.  The treck I've 
laid
&gt;out there is roughly 300 miles give or take, so say 5 hours plus 
even if we
&gt;hump it pretty good, obviously depending on the slowest (lead) Bus 
(or
&gt;diesel Vanagon perhaps)
&gt;
&gt;This means obviously we need to be starting out as early as possible 
and or
&gt;reasonable.  I can hit the area by about 3 pm myself which puts most 
of the
&gt;more scenic Blue Ridge trip still in the afternoon into evening.  I 
can in
&gt;fact ditch class and start out on Thursday or as early Friday as 
possible if
&gt;there more early trekkers, but assuming most people in DC working 
friday, I
&gt;think if we got out of Front Royal no later than 5-6ish it is still 
a doable
&gt;trip with some scenic value, maybe a striking sunset on the Blue 
Ridge
&gt;followed by harrowing night driving.  Else there is always straight 
down I81
&gt;to US220 and down, faster and shorter perhaps.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone interested, please give me a yell, not many DC area types 
have spoken
&gt;yet, and we should have a strong presence.  As usual everyone 
welcome, I
&gt;understand we may even have an (egad) diesel Mercedes on our midst.  
Anyway,
&gt;come Split, come Bay, come Vanagon, come EV.
&gt;
&gt;Of course Chris has the standard camping info up at.

&gt;
&gt;A final aside, there is strong rumour that a certain lazy listmaster 
wants
&gt;to spend the weekend installing and gloating over the new MS Stage 2 
engine
&gt;for his (ugh) Vanagon, however all are encouraged to chastise him 
for this
&gt;thought, and notice is hereby served the exhaust system for said 
Vanagon is
&gt;being held hostage only to be delivered at this campout.
