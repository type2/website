&gt; Hi
&gt; 
&gt; As I have mentioned earlier, passed test ready to go
&gt; etc,  but one tiny 
&gt; problem I can select reverse WITHOUT pressing the
&gt; gearstick down, it 
&gt; just slides right in, this could be problematic at
&gt; freeway speeds.  The 
&gt; other gears are all fine if not a bit stirry.

Like George said - I also think you have the plate
upside down. Look very carefully at the Bentley pics.
The longer tab with what we all call &quot;the ski jump&quot;
goes to the right side. Be sure to follow the
adjustment instructions to the letter. If you're sure
the plate is right-side up, you might try loosening
the two bolts slightly and use a big OLD flatblade
screwdriver and a hammer and from the passenger side
floor area, tap that plate all the way toward the
driver door as it will go then tighten the bolts and
try it. If it still does not lock out reverse, you
have the plate in wrong. -BaH
