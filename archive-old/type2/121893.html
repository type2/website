Mine is all original wood in there, I am going to rebuild it this 
summer with some &quot;mods&quot; and a lighter wood colour.

Jamie Auch put a Safare top on himself and rebuilt his interior, you 
should check out his website, he did a great job.

I'm sure he has some words of wisdom if you ask !

&gt; However, mine's far from looking that nice. :(
&gt;
&gt; You rebuilt all the wood inside? I'm considering that just because of 
&gt; the
&gt; fact that when I got it home it REEKED of mold. Several seals were 
&gt; shot.
&gt; While I'm replacing all the foam and fabric, I'm debating about the 
&gt; wood. I
&gt; probably will just because of the quantity that needs to be replaced to
&gt; service my entertainment center.
