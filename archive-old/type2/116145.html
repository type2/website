Hm, are you referring to the picture on page 26 of the Fuel Injection 
section, Fig. 6-1?  If so, my air cleaner doesn't look like the one in 
the picture.  It has a short rectangular opening, and no connection for 
the hot air hose.

(I would post a picture of it, but I'd have to go to Berkeley to do so, 
since it's it's still in the shop...)

I wonder if I have the wrong air cleaner.  At this point, it wouldn't 
surprise me.  When the engine came out, Marco _at_ Buslab informed me that 
my engine # was for a 914.

&gt; You'll need to have it hooked up correctly to pass your smog test.

Hm.  It passed the test last time (in September) without this 
connection.  Maybe I just got lucky.  Will the engine run noticeably 
better with the hot air hose connected?  (Assuming I'm remembering 
correctly that I have the older AFM without the temp sensor...but it 
would make sense that I do, since all the other FI parts are &quot;early 
'76&quot; style.)
