Charles Watson Asked:

&gt; That is very good to know. How is the peaking coil connected (shunt
series)
&gt; and what voltage is ideal? What value coil? Is CDI normally only used with
&gt; carb VW's?

I used a 'regular' ignition coil - connected normally with +primary to
ignition switch and -primary to points. Don't know high the voltage spike
needs to be, but this is what I have seen work. The secondary of the coil
can be left floating. I don't know what others have used to get around this
problem.

&gt; &gt;The fuel injection ECU uses a signal from the points to tell it when each
&gt; &gt;ignition event occurs. This ECU input requires a spike that is taller
than
&gt; &gt;12 volts - with a points/coil setup you get a spike that is sufficient -
&gt; &gt;with the CDI in the circuit the points doesn't drive the coil directly so
&gt; &gt;this spike does not occur and so the ECU does not see any ignition
events.
&gt; &gt;One solution that I have seen work is to hang an extra coil off the
points
&gt; &gt;-
&gt; &gt;it's only purpose is to create the much needed voltage spike for the ECU.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I have the same problems with my bus currently - I haven't put on the
extra
&gt; &gt;coil patch since I am in the process of replacing my stock FI with an
&gt; &gt;aftermarket DIY kit.
