Subject: 71 Single Cab Wiring Harness

Would anyone happen to know if a wiring harness for a 71 Single cab would be
the same as for the same year bus?  I need a new wiring harness to make my
life easier and have found the harness for the 71 211 971 028J  from Bus
Depot for $146.50.

Any comments one way or another would be appreciated on quality if you have
used this part.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
