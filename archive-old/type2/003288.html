I have 2 AVP rebuilds, the 1600 in the ghia is the sweetest engine going,
started well and just keeps running. The 2.0 l in the 82 vanagon was a
different story. The dist drive was also about 1/2 tooth off, I was able to
move the drive gear 1 tooth and get the desired timing but the vac canister
is pointing too far to the rear. Was able to talk to Leonard about this and
he couldn't understand how this could happen as he personaly assembles each
engine. As this engine breaks in the idle RPMs keeps increasing and the
milage is slowly going back to where it was with the orginal engine.

&gt; Kevin:
&gt;
&gt; I too have a '79 with an engine rebuild from AVP and had a distributor
&gt; problem, though I'm not sure that its the same as yours.  I could start my
&gt; bus, however I could not time it properly.  I couldn't rotate the
&gt; distributor enough since the vacuum advance cannister on the distributor
&gt; would hit the cold start injector, preventing any further advance.  If I
&gt; repositioned/advanced the distributor drive shaft 1 tooth, then I could
not
&gt; get enough retard with the vaccum advance hitting the fan housing.  I'm
not
&gt; sure what the reason for this would be.  The engine block was the the
stock
&gt; original that I sent in to AVP for rebuild.  The FI busses with dual
vaccum
&gt; advance really have very little room for rotating the distributor.  I also
&gt; got no answers from AVP, and yes, Leonard was nearly impossible to reach
&gt; and did not return calls.  However, so far, I'm reasonably satisfied with
&gt; the engine and the work AVP did.
