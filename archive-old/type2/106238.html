Subject: Trans ground strap

The M/T transmission ground strap has been NLA for a while. It's part number
211 971 237B and all vendors that will sell you one you will actually
receive its larger cousin, 111 971 237A from the beetle.

The beetle strap is all silver instead of having a copper core and can be
made to fit but it's too wide for the factory strap shield. This is the
important rubber cover that will keep the strap looking new for years
instead of rusting out and creating a poor ground.

If you don't feel like making modifications, the original 73-79 strap is
still available from the Porsche dealer as part number 999 611 919 20.
