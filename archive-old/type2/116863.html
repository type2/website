&gt;&gt;Well, I guess it is up to me to get her running right.

You can fix it, I have complete confidence in you. Two things have come to 
mind? How is your muffler? My muffler has a hole in it and causes my bus to 
run poorly and backfire.

Also did you replace the points or are you running an electronic iginition?
