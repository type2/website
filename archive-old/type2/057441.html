Subject: Re: Carb problems - '73 bus

+AD4-went dead.  I noticed a strong gas smell, I ran back alarmed.  I noticed
+AD4-that there was gas running down the outside of the carbs+ACE-  It should be
+AD4-noted that this bus runs on an electric fuel pump now.

+AD4-

I almost burned up my bus in the same manner after installing dual Dellortos
and an electric pump.  After calling the shop I bought the carbs from, they
said +ACI-Oh yeah, you need to install a bypass.  We can mail you one.+ACI-   Why
the +AEAAKgAjACE- was I finding this out now, I wondered?  And why hadn't it just
been sent with the carbs?

Anyway, this is what they sent me.  The +ACI-bypass+ACI-  was simply a brass +ACI-T+ACI-
fitting of the correct O.D. for the fuel line.  It installed in the fuel
line upstream of the pump, with a section of hose that tied back into the
supply coming from the fuel tank.  The +ACI-magic+ACI- of this bypass was in the
return leg of the +ACI-T+ACI- going to the tank.  This leg had a brass plug soldered
into the end, through which a small hole had been drilled.  The small hole
allowed pressure remaining in the line to bleed back into the tank, instead
of forcing fuel through the bowl and flooding over the carb.

Simple, and perhaps crude, but effective.  You can make one yourself if
you're handy in the shop, which of course anyone owning a bus must be.  How
much does one of those nice pressure regulators cost anyway??  And wouldn't
you want to carry a spare??  I think a brass +ACI-T+ACI- can be found at a good
parts store for around +ACQ-3.50.  Use the head off a brass screw for the plug,
and drill the hole using a carb jetting drill bit.

Good luck
