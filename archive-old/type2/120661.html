Subject: Re: [T2] Bus tires ?

&gt; specification.  I am running Bridgestone RD603V tires that are available
&gt; at any Firestone outlet.  They were OEM fitment on dual-wheel Toyota
&gt; pickups.

my only problem with the 603vs is Firestone stores themselves.
I wanted to buy them. Tirerack had them at the time listed for like 60.00
each.
I went to the nearest Firestone, they gave me some story and took my
number and the info and never bothered to get to me.
I went to another Firestone also pretty near and it took the guy like 15
minutes and several phone calls to figure out anything, Then he told me
they were special order and over 100.00 per tire (plus mount etc etc)
Huh? I said thats silly. Youre telling me I can get the tires shipped to
me from out of town from a 3rd party company for 30.00 less per tire than
you can sell me directly. WHAT_EVER. He had to talk to the hand.

I ordered Yoko 356 D from tirerack and had a pop and son shop by the rr
tracks mount them for me cheap.
Noone could balance them anyway. No adaptors.


cheers
