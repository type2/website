Subject: Almost running
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hi list, we're still trying to get our '78 rebuilt 2l FI running. Here is
the status:
We have a short in the ignition-switch-to-coil wire which is being bypassed
by a direct jumper from the battery to the coil. The engine cranks and
fires, but only remains running for about 2 sec. It does not seem to matter
if you press on the gas or not. Does anyone have an idea? Things to check?
Thanks a bunch,
C.D.
