Subject: isolator vs relay
Message-ID: &lt;371D21C7.2A13_at_ibm_dot_net&gt;

My jury is in &amp; the isolator is out

well, after a couple of years w/ an isolator being used to charge my
camping battery &amp; primary batt (and a few electrical glitches)
I have installed a heavy duty RV battery charging relay - $17.00

Big difference.
Data:
Alternator charging v - 13.7 volts
w/ the isolator - voltage at batteries: 12.5 volts
Voltage drop due to diodes in isolator: (13.7-12.5=) 1.2 volts !!!!!!
ughhhhh!!

W/ the relay: 
voltage at primary battery (connected directly to alt) 13.7 v
voltage at secondary battery (connected through relay) 13.5 v
voltage drop of 0.2 volts
BUT 1 more volt to the battery during charging

AND, battery light no longer illuminates when the brights, radio &amp; turn
signal are on.

Mounted it to the left of the voltage regulator (be careful of the gas
tank behind the wall- you have &lt;1&quot; to play with when drilling into the
firewall)
connected a lead from the pos of the starting batt to one node on the
relay, connected a lead to the camper battery on the other node of the
relay.
Then (very important) sliced a wire to the alt charging light/heater
blower fan wire (the blue one coming from the voltage regulator) to
control the action of the relay.  This way the two batteries are only
connected when the alternator is creating electricity (very important if
you have a discarged camping batt)

And I am very happy w/ the relay - don't do the isolator!


good luck
