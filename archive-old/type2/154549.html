Subject: Re: [T2] Water tank removal ('79 Westy)

Karl,

Great instructions - tank came out without too much effort. Thanks!

The tank seems to be in good shape.  I can't say as much for the water pump
- it broke at the neck when I tried to get it out.  Right now I've got the
tank sitting with corks in it to plug up the pump hole - so far no leaks.

Now onto a new pump.  Any suggestions as to the best and/or most economical
place to by a replacement pump?  It seems like most of our suppliers on the
list carry them - are any of the pumps better? Do any of them drains in the
pump?  Oh yea, the rubber washer between the filler neck and the cabinet is
shot as well - does anyone carry these or do I need to make one up from an
old inner tube?  Your pump and other thoughts are appreciated.

It takes a little work but it does come out.

Gently remove the filler neck [a claw hammer works if you are careful]
Remove the little plastic nailed in stops holding the wood wall in at the
bottom. [wire cutters work if you are careful] Gently remove the wall.
Loosen the 2 clamps holding the pump and the drain hose. Unscrew the drain
fitting. Then unscrew the pump.
Now remove the phillips screws holding on the black rubber things.
Tank slides out by lifting the back end so the two holes clear the shelf.
