Subject: Re: injector timing query

In the book &quot;Bosch Fuel Injection and Engine Management&quot; there's an 
illustration showing how the ignition sequence of the cylinders and 
opening times of the intake valves is coordinated with the voltage pulses 
to the injection valves.  I can't reproduce the illustration, but quoting 
from the verbage that accompanies the illustration:

&quot;The rpm signal from the ignition circuit enters the control unit through 
a shaper and a divider.  As shown in Fig. 2-23, from each ignition pulse, 
the pulse shaper generates a rectangular pulse (voltage on/voltage off), 
4 per each 4-stroke cycle.  This is divided by two to provide one 
injection pulse per crankshaft revolution; for a 6-cylinder engine, it is 
divided by 3.&quot;

Later on the book explains:

&quot;In a 4-cylinder system, the final stage grounds 4 injectors at the same 
time....... With two injections per four-stoke cycle, each delivery is 
half of the total required.&quot;

So, the &quot;correct&quot; amount of gas is being delivered, 1/2 at a time.

&gt; &gt;They are supposed to receive 12v constantly all the time the ignition is
&gt; on.  When they are to be fired, the ECU grounds them.
&gt; &gt;Since all the injectors are grounded (fired) at the same time, it is
&gt; perfectly OK to swap the plugs.
&gt; 
&gt; ?? Hmmm...yues I've read that somewhere...BUT  the distributor points make
&gt; contact at the right time, sending the primary voltage to the coil (and to
&gt; the ECU input.)   The rotor determines which spark plug gets the secondary
&gt; current.  I'd think the injector has to fire it's gas into the incoming air
&gt; timed  to compression in its cylinder.   But since the brain only gets a
&gt; signal when the points close due to distrib. cam action, how does the ECU
&gt; know which cylinder injector to ground?    Since the fuel ring is under
&gt; pressure and the injectors fire gas at each grounding, wouldn't
&gt; simultaneous injection waste gas???
