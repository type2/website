How to build a traditional, heavy-duty, high volume, low maintenance, mouse
trap...  [See below for OBC]

Parts required:

[1] empty 5 gallon Blazo can or similar substitute.

[1] evaporated milk can or similar substitute [must have both ends intact]

[1] section of heavy steel wire of sufficient length to span the width of
Blazo can plus ~6&quot;.

[1] chunk of firewood or equivalent.

Remove one end of the Blazo can.  It must be able to hold water, so take out
the &quot;bad&quot; end.  Punch a pair of small holes just below the top rim, centered
on 2 opposing sides of the can.

Punch a small hole in the center of each end of the evaporated milk can.

Run the straightened wire through the milk can, then across the top of the
Blazo can supported by the 2 punched holes.  Fold down the excess wire on
each side.  Center the milk can over the open top of the Blazo can.
Determine that the milk can is able to spin/roll freely on its wire support.

Add 3 or 4 inches of water to the Blazo can.  Smear peanut butter and bacon
grease all over the evaporated milk can, striving for neatness and even
weight distribution.

Place the trap in your chosen location.  Lean the firewood against the Blazo
can so it provides a ramp from the floor/ground to the rim of the can.
Retire for the night.

The mice run up the ramp to the top of the trap, attracted by the odor of
the peanut butter and bacon grease.  They jump to the milk can roller.  The
roller rolls and dumps the mice into the water where they drown.
In the morning, dump out the rodent remains with the water [at an
EPA-designated safe disposal site, of course :-)], refill the trap, refresh
the bait if necessary, and put the trap back to work.

The largest single nightly catch inside a building that I've witnessed was
47 mice.  Inside a vehicle [barely qualifies as OBC] it's not uncommon to
catch 6 or 8 overnight.

Traps of this design/construction were standard equipment at patrol cabins,
ranger stations, fire lookouts, and backcountry shelters/cabins around the
Pacific Northwest for many decades.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Mouses.  In Yellowstone Park, our '73 Westie became infested with them.

Here's a hint:  carry mousetraps as standard OBE when camping in national
parks.  The meeses are considered part of the ecosystem, and therefore none
of the stores in any of the Parks carry Decon or sell
traps.  &lt;&lt;
