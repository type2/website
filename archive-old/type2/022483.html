&gt;&gt;Sure it can, that is why god gave us Bosch fuel injection.  All new FI parts
&gt;&gt;wouldn't have required a bit of adjustment 8-)  Yeah they would have cost
&gt;&gt;a bit more...

Still I'd be a lot happier driving carbs and points...  just feel safer, can always 
limp home...

Also:

&gt;It would have to be engineered, or fabricated and trial and errored to
&gt;death. The 1.7L never was delivered with FI. Then, of course, it wouldn't
&gt;be stock, where the highest value to the most is found. Why?? Cause it's
&gt;easy to make stock work right.


True, why bother and destroy a sweet charismatic dual carbed system, 
the other way around sounds a lot more appealing to me...  (replace the 
messy FI with carbs(!)) The 1.7 came with FI in either the 914 or type 4s, 
or both. I've had a W code 1.7 with FI. Could be a Europe only thing, but 
in case of FI I doubt it.
