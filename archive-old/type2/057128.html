&gt; I apologize for what may be a dumb question here, but I can't find an

&gt; Westy, 2.0 liter, and have no trouble finding the timing scale mounted
&gt; beside the pulley, but can't find a reference mark anywhere on the
&gt; pulley.  Where is the pulley mark and what does it look like?

The timing mark on my '76 and '78 engines is located on the forward face
(toward the engine) of the pulley that drives the alternator (which is
also the fan that cools the engine).  It is just barely big enough to
catch a fingernail if you know where to look, and needs an immediate spot
of white paint if you ever hope to time your engine with any reasonable
chance of success.  The best way to find the timing mark the first time is
to take the screen off the fan, and look at the center of the hub. 
Notice that divot in the center of the hub?  Turn it 'til it is pointed
toward the timing scale and then run your fingernail around the inner edge
of the pulley.  The mark *is* out there! :-)

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
