Subject: for anyone who does not yet know about craigslist

It is not for just the Bay Area anymore. The homepage goes to areas all 
over the US and the globe now. One can find just about everything on CL. 
Favorite searches for me include &quot;vw camper&quot; and &quot;vw bus&quot;.

This isn't for me, but I did think I would forward it on to the list: 
http://www.craigslist_dot_org/sby/car/57074580.html
