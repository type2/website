Subject: Re: [T2] Paint question

I have the habit of taking out dents when someone brings the VW to my  shop 
to be worked on. 
  The dent removal people are good but a lot of times they drill holes  and 
it will rust later.
 
If its a dent you can get to both sides even if you need another person on  
the outside, make sure you have a dolly behind the area your repairing. You  
only want to tap the metal and start from the outside. and tap in.  Feel  for a 
ridge around the outside of a ding /dent and tap that first still  with a 
dolly on the other side of the metal.  Put tape on the head lf  the hammer your 
using to avoid chipping the paint. 
You can ask a paint supply store to &quot;profit&quot; the paint around the dent and  
see if their skilled in matching the color.
