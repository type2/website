Subject: type IV engine stand

re:

I think you need a bit heavier stand. The stand in the picture a nice wide
backside with a wide beam with two straight rolling wheels; but the &quot;front&quot;
end only has &lt;one&gt; point and is therefore way too easy to tip over sideways.
I have a similar el cheapo HF stand, but my stand has two wheels on the front
with a wide beam that is much harder to tip. I have rebuilt Type IV engines
on my stand, but I sure wouldn't try to start an engine on this stand.  I
couldn't just directly bolt on the engine. I had to make some &quot;adapters&quot; out
of 3/8&quot; bar stock to mount against the engine and then get a bunch of short
pipes and long bolts to adapt the stand mount to fit the engine. I leave off
the flywheel because I can't get it through the mounts.
