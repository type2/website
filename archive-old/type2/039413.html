Subject: '71 bus dash switches

Hello all,

	I have recently aquired a '71 bus that is in decent condition but
has been modified here and there.  The problem is I've never owned a bus
(I've owned a '70 bug since 1988 though) so I'm having a hard time figuring
out what is stock on a '71 bus.  I'll probably end up asking for your
expert help in answering many questions in the weeks and months to come so
I hope you all are patient with bus newbies. (fingers crossed).

	My first question has to do with the number of switches on the
dashboard, and there postions.  I know that my bus' switches have been
messed with pretty badly.  There are 8 total; 3 being simple toggle
switches.  They are postioned from left to right as follows:

lights, toggle(to nothing), [steering column], dome light, wipers,
emergency flashers, toggle(to horn), defogger, toggle(to nothing).

	Can anyone confirm that this is wrong?  The wiring diagram in my
bus manual (Bentley) shows only 6 switches, and has them positioned left to
right as follows:

fan motors, dome light, [steering column], lights, wipers, emergency
flashers, defogger.

...but I'm not sure if the position on the wiring diagram is simply for
convience in displaying the all the wiring.  I'm assumming that the
previous owner drilled holes to accomodate the extra switches.  Also, Where
the heck are the fan motors located?

Thanks so much for any responses,
Adam in California
