Hello all, 
I've been on the list for a while, mainly lurking because I haven't had a bus
for a few months.  Tomorrow a Chinchilla green/gray '69 transporter will be
rolling into my driveway, and i'll be wearing a great big smile.  The thing is
cherry.  You just don't see them like this in Ohio.  
So this further motivates myself to get rid of the wrecked vanagon sitting in
my driveway.  If anybody is interested in parts, most all of it is still there
and up for grabs.  All prices are negotiable.
*Complete vanagon Westfalia interior, beige, sink/fridge/stove, $500 obo
*Complete 7-seater interior, brown vinyl 
*2 liter F.I. engine, fuel injection intact, 104k miles, strong runner w/ new
heater      boxes and exhaust, $600 obo complete
*A/C unit (dealer installed mounts above b-pillars)
*4 spd transmission 104k miles, into &amp; out of every gear smoothly, runs great
$250
*all sorts of other misc. odds and ends, let me know what you need!
*all lights and mirrors, etc.
located in Columbus Ohio.  I have to get the body/shell out of here by new
years.  
e-mail me if you're interested.

Andy
'69 bus as of tomorrow
(this has vent windows, chrome trim, 7-seater--is this deluxe? or what's the
official designation?)
