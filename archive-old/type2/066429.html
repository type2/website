To all following the ASI thread.

I have the &quot;Warranty and Maintenance&quot; manual that came with my '77 Riviera
II.  The particulars for ASI are:

American Services Inc.
Camper Division
2001 West Fourth Plain Blvd.
Vancouver, WA 98660
(206)693-5835

If anyone finds out that they're still around, please let me know.  I've
been too cheap (broke) to drop the necessary $1.00 to call.

Jim
