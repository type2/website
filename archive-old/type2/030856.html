&gt; How is a bus &quot;appropriate&quot; to one's personality?

Cleanee glassee and re-read original post.  The poster (not me, as you
erred - and Nomex shorts don't protect ya from that, pal :) said a bus
would be _more appropriate to their personalities than a limo. 

Could be clueless trendsters, sure, loving only the visuals, perhaps --
but a splittie, for example, is surely &quot;more appropriate&quot; to some
personalities than say a Humvee, Navigator, or Prizm.  Cars are
communicative artifacts, like it or not.
