Top 'o the mornin' to y'all ..

--- snip ---

On the way home from work tonight, I had to use the
wipers. They made one
hell of a racket, when switched on! They were
labouring &amp; straining badly.
Last time I used the wipers, they worked fine (albeit
slowly!) I have a 75
Bus.
Any solutions?
(I drove home in the rain &amp; left the wipers off!)

--- snip ---

The wipers in my bus aren't making any noise (yet) but
they sure are sloooow, esp. at the faster setting ..
is this a sign that the w/w motor is not long for this
world, or possibly a voltage problem?  P.S.  Since it
rains a lot here in the subtropics, I've been carrying
Rain-X with me and applying it liberally .. works
great, and no, I don't work for Rain-X  :^)
