Sorry for my mistake, mates.  Where I originally stated that I used a Class
I hitch, I should have indicated a Class III - that is what I used.
Concerning the transmission, you are absolutely correct.  My concern was
minimal as I planned on a complete overhaul upon my arrival in GA.  Please
accept my apologies - next time I'll double-check my info before posting!!

Thanks,

&gt;ahhh, i think the more concern is to the vans tranny not the cherokee.
&gt; and a class 2 or class 3 hitch is a hell of a lot safer,  a class 1
&gt;is only rated for 1500 lbs, where as a class 2 is 3500 and a class 3
&gt;is 5000 lbs. and up.
&gt;dragging a rear wheel vehicle on its drive wheels , even with it in
&gt;neutral, causes the tranny to turn. most think it does not, but it
&gt;does. u can prematurely wear out or even ruin your tranny on long
&gt;hauls...........just a safety note, for all concerned
