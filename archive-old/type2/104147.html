I can confirm this. I lost a pump going to EB last year &amp; had to
replace it at the campsite. I tried to get a vendor or 2 to overnight
me a correct replacement, but to no avail. So I did the next best
thing. I went over to where Greg Potts &amp; camp were &amp; asked for the
part number from the pump they replaced on the way down. He spent some
time comparing numbers (flow/pressure/size) and came up with the pump
they used on mid 80's bronco II's (IIRC). 

There are a few cavets to using this in place of the correct pump. All
pertain to fit and finish.

1) the electrical connection is different. the pump (new) comes with a
wiring connector converter to help with this. You just basically add
an extention to the current wires that will hook up to the pump.

2) the inlet and outlet sizes are different than stock VW. The inlet
being the most drastic. The VW pump uses a large suction connection
(10mm?) which matches up very nicely with the stock fuel filter. The
ford pump requires you get a replacement filter that is different to
connect correctly. Not a problem, but the finish isn't as good as
stock.

3) the new punp is longer due to the connectors for the hose so your
space is more restricted under the bus. I have been meaning to try and
find different connectors to screw into the pump for a nicer fit, just
haven't bothered. Anyone with a vanagon will not have the problem with
the space, since the pump mounts differently. but us bay owners have
only a small amount of space to work from.


good luck.
