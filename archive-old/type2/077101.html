Mark,
     If you can live with that little quirk in reverse, why spend money you 
don't have to, or better yet--put that money to use else where in your bus 
(hyd. lifters come to mind).  Trans builders have gotten better with their 
rebuilds, but they still can't match the quality of the Volkswagen factory..  
You just don't get the 200,000 miles out of them like you do with the 
untouched originals.
                                                                       Peace,
