&lt;&lt;  regarding hogging out the holes for teh acorn nuts?  I
say stay away from that, get the nuts/studs that are
designed for the wheels(mercedes/audi and life will be
easier(AND SAFER!!!) &gt;&gt;

Perhaps I should have said dished...The Mercedes uses 
lug bolts that sit flat against the wheel's steel insert.
The Bus uses lug nuts with a convex face. A ball grinder
bit used on the Mercedes wheel insert gives a concave
face to it. Using the stock Mercedes lug bolts would require
pressing the VW lug bolts out of the drums and calipers.
I've no idea if the holes would/could be tapped to accept
the Mercedes bolts...
