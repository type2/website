Subject: Friday topic for Oz (Australian) listees - Save the Bays Stickers

Hi All,

I've been talking to Mike Viskett about the Save the Bays stickers;

&quot;&gt;SaveTheBays:
&gt;Hopefully, the print shop will come through, and we'll have some free =
&quot;Save The Bays&quot; window (or bumper) stickers for you folks with Bay =
Windows.=20
&gt;See:
&gt; www.SaveTheBays_dot_org for a picture of the stickers.&quot;

Mike's sending some stickers over to me, and he's asked me to;
a) find out how many we're after over here, and,
b) distribute them to the listees here ( he'll be sending me one =
envelope, with me to mail them out to the &quot;locals&quot; when I get them).

Therefore, if anyone over here ( and NZ, if anyone's really interested ) =
wants a STB sticker, please Email me with your postal address to let me =
know.

NB: Mike, we're after 6 so far.

Thanks guys,
