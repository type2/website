&gt; Hi listees,
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone had any luck cleaning the rear seat belts in a bay?  I have the 
&gt; originals and they do work, but are VERY hard to adjust.  I give many kids 
&gt; rides home from school and they aren't always the same ones in the same 
&gt; seats.  I would rather keep the belts that I have if I can make them safe and 
&gt; easier to adjust.  

You can dip them in soapy water and flex them back and forth to loosen
them up.  I did this and it made them easier, but in the end I ended up
installing self-adjusting belts from a late-80s  Sirocco  Much better for
the kids, as no adjustment is required at all.
