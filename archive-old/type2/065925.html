&gt; Okay, okay....I should have been prepared from our previous discussions
&gt; here that I would be in for a blast of reality.  I took myself and my
&gt; book of pictures of Bessie, my bus to a local restoration shop today. 
&gt; The guy who part owns it is a very nice gentleman, and spent plenty of
&gt; time with me looking at the pictures.  He restores mainly German cars,
&gt; mostly Porsches, and does incredible work.  And now for the fun part...
&gt; after just looking at the pictures and guessing that the bus was
&gt; reasonable straight and rust free, he GUESSED that a two tone paint job,
&gt; interior, and engine compartment would run between $5k and $6k.  I
&gt; grabbed onto a pole for support...the blood rushed to my head and I felt
&gt; all dizzy.  But then again...I saw a Porsche he did 15 years ago in his
&gt; showroom for sale, and it looks new.  So....I would get a VERY clean bus
&gt; on the top end, inside, and in the back for that price.  What do you
&gt; guys think?  I was hoping for the $3k to $3500 range, but don't know
&gt; what to expect.  I figure two things....I will pay for this job and be
&gt; extremely happy with the workmanship for the next 15 years at least, or
&gt; drop my price and go with a good job and get what I pay for.  I don't
&gt; expect to get my money back, and don't plan on selling anytime soon.
&gt; 

&gt;From my experience, that is about what you should expect to pay if this 
guy is really good. There is a lot of surface area to prepare on a bus, 
and most of the dollars go towards prep work (BLOCKING&lt; BLOCKING&lt; 
BLOCKING&lt; AND MORE BLOCKING!!!!!!)  It might be just a wee bit on the 
high side, but is not outrageous

My 2 cents
