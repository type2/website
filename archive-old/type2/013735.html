Subject: Looking for a distributor 
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello list,

I am looking for a complete, correct distributor and
vacuum advance unit that is for a 73 automatic engine.
It must be in good running order. I just bought a
stock set of solex carburators for my bus and now I
would like the stock vacuum advance and correct
distributor. the distributor number can be any of the
following:

0231 173 007; 
021 905 205F;
0231 173 008;
021 905 205Q 

If any of you can help me find one or know of a source
that actually sells these, please let me know. 

I want to thank all of you that helped me find out
what the correct distributor was suppose to be and
letting me know that the number on the distributor
housing means nothing if the guts have been changed.

If any one can help me I would be most grateful.
Thanks again!

David Kelly
