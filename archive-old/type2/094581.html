Subject: BNNTA update...

------=_NextPart_001_000A_01C245DC.9DDF1640

Hi everyone,

Two weeks to go, all looks great!  Preparations for us are busy and going=
 well.  The weather has been rather pleasant lately, but who knows what t=
he Labor Day weekend will be like?  It was unusually cool, last year!  An=
d very hot the year before, so go figure!  No matter what, we've got the =
lake and outside cold showers to use to cool down if it's hot, so bring y=
our water toys!

The Mapquest link was goofed up on the BNNTA event web site (  www.BNNTA.=
com  ) for quite some time.  When you clicked on it, you got a location s=
omewhere in Kansas.  Well, I'm pleased to say that BNNTA is not in Kansas=
 anymore!  The Mapquest link was working correctly as of this morning and=
 pointing the way to the Indian Creak &quot;group&quot; campground at Mark Twain La=
ke.  =20

We look forward to seeing many of you (and all those Busses) at the gathe=
ring soon!
