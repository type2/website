&gt;There is a down side, though. The Gas-A-Justs are *very* stiff and

&gt;the shocks up front with the softer (so I'm told) KYB GR-2 gas struts.
&gt;Dennis Haynes recommends this combination (GR-2 up front, Gas-A-Justs
&gt;in the back) for the vanagon, so I would *assume* it's also a viable
&gt;alternative for the breadloaf (but don't know for sure).

Checking Bus Boys' catalog (yes, I actually have one!) they list the GR-2
and gas-a-just for the Vanagon but only the gas-a-just for the breadloaf.
And they only list the GR-2 for the *front* of the Vanagon.  RMMW only
lists gas-a-just's.

I got a flyer in the mail from Rocky Mountain Motor Works (RMMW) yesterday,
and unlike the last one I got back in May, this one had some *great* bus
deals in it.  They have:

KYB Gas-A-Just shocks for $29.95
Tom Wilson's &quot;How to Rebuild your Air Cooled VW&quot; book (essential!) for $12.95
Wolf nose bras for busses $69.95
VW bus mudflap kit $29.95

And the kicker:

15 different VDO gauges on sale!!!  All but one are under $30.

I just ordered a voltmeter for $22.95 and a pair of the KYB shocks.  Folks,
if you've been contemplating buying any gauges for your bus, get them now!
These prices are a good 30% off of normal retail.  The 2-1/16&quot; clocks are
real nice for $29.95, too.
