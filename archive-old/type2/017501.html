Subject: Mystery oil leak

I have a MoFoCo rebuilt long block in my white 71 Westy(her name is
Matilda).  I got the motor out of my red 71 Westy (her name is &quot;Red Bus&quot;)
which I purchased after the PO smashed the front end.  The engine has about
500 miles on it and leaks oil only when driving.  As near as I can see, it
seems to be coming out between the sump cover and the oil pump.  i cleaned
it off and watched as my g/f revved the motor.  It seems to just appear and
drip from the center case split.  The oil loss is barely noticable, but
there is always a little puddle of oil that forms under the bus after I
drive it.  She is in a shop now for winter rust repair, and didn't leak a
drop until I started it up last weekend.  Should I worry about this??? 
thanks...
