Subject: RE: ...69 wiring update

Thanks, I had heard about hooking a capacitor up, but I didn't understand
how you were supposed to do it. Basically there is a wire from the fuse box
that splits. One feeds the radio, and one goes into the capacitor. I guess
what is weird to me is that the wire goes into the capacitor, but nothing
comes out? I guess it is grounded on the turn signal cluster?

The capacitor is supposed to help reduce 'static' interference in the radio.

If you listen to a weak station, it may make some difference.
