&gt; Just got Frances' engine down to long block stage and started cleaning off

&gt; molten aluminum (my worst fears are embellishing the description somewhat).
&gt; Being a newbie, I'm wondering whether this is from the casting process or is
&gt; my case really toast?  Most of the cracks are around the distributor area,
&gt; and above the oil filler tube (the only areas I've really cleaned so far),
&gt; extending around the rear bearing housing.  The cracks are generally 1/2&quot;
&gt; long and raised enough that they catch and tear a rag if you drag it over
&gt; them.

sounds like someone painted the block and the paint crazed, but it
really is moulding lines. and unless it goes through the case or has
weakened the case it is harmless.  I have seen this many times, if you are
really paranoid have the case examined by an expert machinist.

&gt; Please tell me my case isn't garbage!  Or, if it is, where do I get a new T4
&gt; case?

relax and have a beer, you should be fine
