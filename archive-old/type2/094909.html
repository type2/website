Subject: Re: [T2] AFM's CO adjustment and emission test




&gt;From: Craig &lt;jimcricket_at_kendra_dot_com&gt;

&gt;    Failed emmisions test. What to do? Here are the numbers:
&gt;
&gt;	           HC      CO
&gt;Cruise limit      220      1.2
&gt;   &quot;&quot;   Emmision    29      0.47
&gt;                   Pass     Pass
&gt;
&gt;Idle Limit        220      1.2
&gt;&quot;&quot;   Emission     108      1.38
&gt;                   Pass     FAIL
&gt;
&gt;My settings:  Fresh rebuild ( 3 hours ) some road time. Valve gap currently
&gt;at .006&quot;  7.5 BTDC, Idle  850 -950 rpm  CO screw adjustment is currently
&gt;screwed all the way in. Does that mean it is running as rich as it can?
&gt;
&gt;Can I back out on the adj. screw with any luck?

You are at max rich. Backing screw out will reduce C0 at idle. Don't over do 
it.

Is this with or with out catalytic converter and/or lambda (1979)?
