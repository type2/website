Subject: Sunroof cables

Thanks David 
Ive also found another van with a perfectly in tack
sunroof and all the trim parts too but it doesnt move
so im going to very carefully try to remove the cables
for spares........
Now can I ask a very dumb question ......What is
&quot;Moly&quot; grease?
I enjoy a perfectly sliding sunroof now also.....NOW
its just the rest of my bus I need to get to work on.
Rus 71 bus in bartlesville OK
