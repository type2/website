Hey Folks,

Wow!! My idea seems to have snowballed! The response
has been pretty good so far.

One thing, though. I was only referring to linking
each others web-pages using hyper-links and brief
descriptions of what to find at this &quot;linked&quot; site.
Some of you with *much* more code-writing savvy are
talking about a far more ambitious project!!! 


I think the idea of a searchable index located on a
dedicated server (type II's or whoevers) is nothing
short of fantastic, but beyond my ability to perform.
If someone decides to go forward on this type of a
project, I offer any help that I can! I have a
scanner, Corel Draw 8 and am a pretty decent artist,
too (for technical drawings, cutaways, line-drawings,
etc..). If I can be of any assistance, let me know...


To those who are interested in my idea of linking
pages, let me know by p-mail. I have lot's of ideas on
how this could be done effectively, but don't want to
waste the list's bandwidth. Also, for those who wrote
me and asked about setting up a web-page (sorry,
Steve, I accidentally deleted all my e-mail last night
and can't p-mail these people), go buy a book called
&quot;html for Dummies&quot; at your local bookstore, it's like
the idiot's guide and very easy to follow.
