Subject: Bus Tent For Sale

Howdy. I am posting this for a friend, so please just call him.

For Sale- Side tent which attaches to the cargo door of your bus. Most of you
probably know what I'm talking about. It's from a '78 Westfalia, but will
attach to pretty much any year bus.
It has all the poles, and bags, and is in very good condition, with a 2&quot; hole
in one side  that was patched years ago.
He is asking $350
Please call Sean at 919-834-2800
