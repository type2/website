Subject: Re: [T2] bee expert needed

I had some wasps that I decided to let live on my premises. I thought that
we were getting along just fine, until one especially warm day, when they
stung the carp out of me. Whoosh! Out came the canned wasp killer. So sorry,
waspies!
During cool weather, they are sluggish and won't bother you. When it warms
up, they go &quot;on the prod&quot; quickly and the stingers hurt. Worse yet, someone
might be allergic to bee stings and have an anaphylactic shock reaction,
which can even cause death.
