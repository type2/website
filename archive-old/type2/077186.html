I have a 78 also
the trouble shooting manual for the FI system is on line in the library

make sure you get the right kind, VW requires if I recall 35PSI, these
buggers are expensive, over $100 new

&gt; up, replaced the fuel filter, all fuel line.  The

good.

&gt; results I know of so far: the cold start valve works
&gt; because the thing fires at the little bit if fuel that
&gt; the valve supplies.  I pulled the injectors, none of
&gt; them fire any fuel.  The hot lead is working just

if none of em fire I would check the trigger circuit and fuel ring presure
first.  the fuel presure valve could be letting the presure too low. or
your trigger circuit is not working.   

&gt; fine, because if I ground a test light elsewhere, it
&gt; lights.  I understand that the negative is switched
&gt; for the injectors.

this is correct, the injectors are on and triggered off by the trigger
circuit, all 4 at the same time

&gt; fine.  I have a few more to test.

follow the flow chart in the FI trouble shooting manual
