Subject: [T2] Web pages updated 

Ok pages are up and running i think , George ck i think i made the changes
needed for you to acess by buttons and no typing , let me know if it didn't
work , oh and i put a back to top button or next page button at the bottom
of the long pages also. On bus content there are 2 up this month The 56
Standard Sunroof ,And Toma's 66 21 Window. I have been scarce lately on the
net due to computer problems and just generally working my tail off. enjoy
the pics and yell if you need anything. Later
