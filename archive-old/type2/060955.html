Subject: Re: rubber mats around the seat bases 

I bought the bus depot   'seat pedestal covers'. They are IMHO high
quality, but they only cover the outside of the pedestal. From what I
can gather the parts you are looking for are not available, hope someone
can prove me wrong. 
I bought app, a yard of black material, end of a roll for $5 and can of
spray glue for $6 and covered my front kick panels this week, probally
do the same for the sides of the seat. I figure the tricky part will be
getting the pattern cut to fit right.
