&gt; then it gets weird.  uncle wants to go to a bank to get it notarized
&gt; RIGHT NOW. um, saturday, 6 pm. not gonna happen. plus, i have
&gt; personal items to get out - come back tomorrow.  ok he says. so then
&gt; the kid asks 'how much did we agree on?'  1200.  'would you take
&gt; $400?' the roof rack is worth almost that much, so no.  'how about
&gt; eight?'  i'll think about. see you tomorrow.


It's a minor scam.  People make a deal, then &quot;oops&quot; don't have the full
amount agreed upon on a Saturday or Sunday when the banks are closed.
They dangle the cash under the seller's nose and hope that he bites.
Happened to me a couple of times.  I told them that the vehicle would
still be there on Monday.  One came back, the other didn't.

Don't sell for less than the agreed upon price.  Doing so just encourages
more of the same.

I would definitely recommend &quot;cash only&quot; (and look at the cash closely)
If the sale goes through, make sure that you notify the DMV of the sale,
as folks of this type often don't intend to reregister the vehicle, thus
rendering themselves immune to parking tickets for the year or so they
use the vehicle.
