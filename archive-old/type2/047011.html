&gt; Because I have been dealing wiht a bunch of nasty ol' carb and other parts
&gt; lately, I went out looking for a good parts cleaner in bulk a while back.
&gt; I found a 1 gallon can and dipper basket wearing the brand name &quot;Chem
&gt; Clean&quot;.  Bought it and used it and I have to say that while it works a
&gt; treat for removing all sorts of nasty gunk form carbs, I cannot reccomend
&gt; it.  It is just way too toxic for my tastes.

I agree that that stuff is pretty nasty.  My gallon sits in the corner of
the garage sitting in another metal pan.  I had a can rust through which
contaminated some soil right outside my garage when the stuff leaked to.
I dug up the bad soil and incinerated it bit by bit in a desert campfire
to burn off the nasty volitiles.

When I use it, it goes outside and I stay upwind of the pot.  Never had
any physical effects from it, but it does demand caution.

For ordinary cleaning, spray carb cleaner is the norm for me.  It seems to
cut the varnish pretty well and evaporates completely.  What little
residue is left goes into the waste oil.  Definitely wear gloves and
goggles for this stuff, and if some of the stuff gets inside the gloves
change them immediately or risk burns.
