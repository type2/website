Subject: dashboard repair...
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Gentlepersons-
                       Whilst looking through the Eastwood Restoration 
products how-to section
on refinishing (Mercedes-Benz...) alloy wheels, I browsed through the on-line 
catalog a
bit and noticed an extensive line of plastic welding/repair products. Seems I 
recall a list
member looking for a method/source for repairing cracks in their dash board. 
The East-
wood site is &lt;http://www.eastwoodco_dot_com&gt;. Plenty of info there, and a request 
form
for a free paper catalog.
                       My search for obscure rubber products continues...Any 
artisans out there with experience in DIY rubber molding? Essentially, I'm 
trying to duplicate an out
of production weather strip. I've got a small (!) section of original to use 
as a form to
make duplicates. Any one with exprience in this area? I've made latex molds 
from old
pieces before, but they had one flat side; this is an extrusion similar in 
form to a gar-
age door weatherstrip with a preformed arch with a &quot;T&quot; at one end.
TIA.
