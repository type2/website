Subject: Re: Bus Legalities

Hey there Jeff,

I don't know much about seatbelt laws, but I'll give my .02 on the beer 
question.  I personally live in Seattle, but I have a freind up in BC that 
drives a westy, and I know it's legal to have beers in the back of his bus, 
just not in the two front seats.  Although he does have a sticker (just 
inside the slider) that somehow proves it is registered as a &quot;RV&quot;.  So you 
may have to obtain an RV sticker to make the drinking totally legal.  I 
could get in contact with him if you need more info.  Just let me know.

Although beware, driving around with a bunch of drunk yahoos in your car, 
even when legal, may be fun at first but it can lead to bad things.

&gt;I know this question was asked a long time ago but I can't remember what 
&gt;the
&gt;final answer was. I wondering about the legalities of driving with
&gt;passengers in the back of my Riveria. There are no seat belts in the back 
&gt;on
&gt;the bench seats by the table, but I didn't really think this mattered
&gt;because I thought the camper was considered an RV. Also if it is classified
&gt;as an RV does that mean that passengers in the back (as far away from the
&gt;driver as possible)are allowed to drink beer while on the road? I live in
&gt;Canada so things might be different up here in the great white north but I
&gt;just thought I would check things out before I depart for the weekend.
&gt;
&gt;cheers...
