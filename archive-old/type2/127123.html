Subject: bowden tube correct bends in bentley

ok so i have looked over my bentley and need to make sure that i am reading this right cause  i dont think that i have the correct bends in my bowden tube....
76 transporter 79 tranny.... 
 
ok on page 52 figure 15-17 it shows sites A and B for the correct bends...
i am not sure that i have the B bend in mine correctly.dont see a bend there..? just at site A.. and if not... it talks of washers to make it right and the washers to be put at site A ???
 ok i noticed that there is this fat rubber piece that just slides back and forth with no meaning between A and B sites....?
was this suppose to go at site A and is this the washer that is refered to...?
 
i am out of threads on my cable and need to make sure that it is the cable.. after reading bentley makes me think that it is nothing more wrong than the B site bend is not there..?
on the troubleshooting page it says that this can cause the shifting in the gears to be tuff and what not..~!~
thanks for the help hope thats not to confusing..
peace
Cha
