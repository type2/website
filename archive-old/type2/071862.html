Subject: Gas pedal problem
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Hi fellow Bussers and Bussettes:
  
   Went out in the rather warm (for us, anyway) 25 degree weather today to 
fire up my 69 Bus. It had been sitting (stored) for the last month without 
moving. Hit the key- and the gas pedal- and the pedal went to the floor and 
stayed there. To make a long story short- cable is fine (relatively new)- my 
pedal needs rebuilding. 
    Looking in my various catalogs- I find all of the parts that go inside 
the bus (pedal, hinge, spring) and of course I find cables. But I also need 
the part that goes under the bus that the actual cable attaches to.  It is a 
piece of steel with a hole for the cable &quot;hook&quot; on one end- and the &quot;rod&quot; 
from the pedal goes through the other end. It seems as though the hole for 
the &quot;rod&quot;  has opened up-  after  170K miles the hole is more of an oval 
shape- and the &quot;rod&quot; is able to slide past the 90 degree bend. 
    Hope that all made sense. Anyway- does anyone have- or know of- a place 
that sells that piece?   Or is it a case of getting lucky in the junkyard? Or 
am I stuck taking mine off and having someone weld the hole back to more of a 
circle? (would rather not do this option.)
   Anyone eperience this?
