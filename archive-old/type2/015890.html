Volks, it is really not that hard to make ANY carb/manifold setup work with
a dual vacuum dizzy.  Quick description for those who need it:

There are two types of connections, manifold vacuum and carb vacuum.  

Manifold vacuum is high at idle, low at full throttle.
You hook the manifold vacuum to the retard side of the dizzy canister, so
that it retards timing at idle but not when you are accelerating.

Carb vacuum is low at idle, high at full throttle.
You hook carb vacuum to the advance side of the dizzy canister, so that it
advances timing when you accelerate but does nothing at idle.

I have never seen a carb without at least one carb vacuum port.  This
includes the infamous Weber progressives (at least the ones I have seen).
It is usually near the center (vertically) of the carb.  Find it, Tee off
of it if you have to, and hook it to your vacuum advance.

Manifold vacuum is usually where the problem comes.  Manifold vacuum can
come either from a port on the intake manifold (Some manifolds do not have
a port) or from the bottom of the carb below the throttle plate (not really
the carb, I know, but it might appear that way).

If you cannot find a manifold vacuum port (one that reads vacuum at idle -
get a vacuum gauge if you're not sure) you can add one.  All it is is
simply a pipe leading to the interior of the manifold - no magic, no extra
parts.  You can take your manifold to a machine shop and have one added, or
even do it yourself depending on the equipment you have.  If you don't want
to mess with your manifold, you can tee off of the brake booster line -
that is manifold vacuum also (remember, only two kinds and manifold vacuum
is more common).  If you don't have a port for the brake booster, you will
still need to drill into your manifold.

Someone recently posted a very nice description of how to add a manifold
vacuum port to an intake manifold.  Search the archives for &quot;braze&quot; and you
will probably find it.  Basically, drill hole, insert pipe,
weld/braze/seal/whatever.

Bottom line is this - it's not as hard as you think to put a dual diaphragm
distributor on ANY bus once you know what needs to be done.
