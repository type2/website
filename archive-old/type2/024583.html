Hey Y'all,
  As you may have seen in my sig, I have had a 63 Bug for sale. Well I sold
it this last thursday and agreed to tow it out to Seqim Wa. from Tacoma
(about 2.5 hours). I was just using a normal tow bar, so all 4 wheels were
on the ground. About half way there, doing around 70mph(I know too fast), I
heard a noise, then saw the left front wheel of the Bug come shooting past
me. It rolled across the middle of Hwy 3, up the hill around a sign, then
back down to the street. All the lug bolts came off. I knew I should have
checked those! 
  Well, on the return trip I went by to get the Bus with the money he paid
me for the Bug. Lucky for me the Bus was in Tacoma. Its a 71 Westy. When I
looked at it that week the engine was locked, it had no key, and was full of
the PO's junk. The bus had come from Colorado and must have died shortly
after getting it here. It was then abandon, auctioned, sold to a guy at the
&quot;Old Volks Home&quot; in Tacoma. I then got it from him for $250. The Bus has
some rust in the lower rockers, and in front of the rear wheels. It does not
have any rust in the battery tray though. The interior is all there minus
the childs cot and the fauset. It has newer curtains. Someone replaced the
nose after some damage and did a decent job. I towed it home and on the way
the hitch broke and the bus ran into the back of the truck. Its a good thing
for that front mounted spare tire, it saved the bus from damage. I got it
home, added some oil, and the engine was still stuck. I put it in gear and
pulled the truck forward and it broke the engine loose. After I had a new
key made, the engine started right up. I ran good, but it has a knock(I knew
it would), but it allowed me to take the bus for a short drive and check out
the brakes, steering, lights and trans. To my suprise it all checked good. 
  So now I have a nice 71 Westy that just needs an engine. It also came with
a oil sump heater, and an external oil filter that uses the rear (RIR)
pressure regulator/releif valve(?) as a return. Anyone ever seen one of
these before?
