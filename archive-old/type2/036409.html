Hey Andy,

              A relationship got severely strained some years back when my
then-friend took my then-new Jaguar on a shopping trip, suffered a flat
battery, and got a jump from a well-intending Samaritan in the parking lot.
Result:  blown Lucas/Bosch computer... costs to repair ran into kilobucks.
I had earlier, with some pride,  described why the Jag's engine room did not
have the handsome SU carb setup seen on her father's 1967 E type.  It's
scary when your car has more brainpower than you do......  That's why I love
old Volksies -- you can depend on them, if you understand them.

The incident above took place in the mid/late 1980s.  I think by now nearly
everyone is aware that all newer cars have a lot of computing power..... and
most folks know you can blow microcomputers in less than a microsecond.

The Cuban lady you helped may be unaware --  Jumping batteries is risky,
given present-day technology.  Given what we know about diseases, you would
not ask to borrow a toothbrush from a stranger, right?

Good wishes
Glenn
