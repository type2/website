&gt; I was in Florida in a rental car, ran out of gas at a
&gt; toll booth. Tow truck with AAA goes by ( not towing
&gt; a car) I yell to the guy  &quot;Hey, I'm a AAA member
&gt; and I need gas&quot; The SOB yelled back, &quot;Call it in&quot;
&gt; and took off. They will never see another penny
&gt; from me.


Many tow truck operators tend to be less than helpful when dealing with auto
club members (not just AAA) because the per-mile rate that they are paid by
the auto clubs is far less than they get for private tows.  They're often
anxious to finish up the auto club tow and get back to more lucrative work.
This is also why some tend to prioritize non-auto-club tows in front of auto
club tows, regardless of which got called in first; hence the
commonly-experienced 2 hour wait for an auto club tow.  Not that I'm saying
this attitude is justified or excusable.  If they didn't want to work for
that price, they didn't have to sign on with AAA in the first place.  Some
auto clubs allow you the option of arranging your own tow and then applying
for reimbursement later.  This is more work later but can result in a faster
tow at the time.  However, few will tow anywhere near the 100 miles that AAA
Plus does.
