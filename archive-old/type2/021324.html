Since I made the oil temp gauge from a $10 on sale digital thermometer,
I got the kind you mention, with the wired separate probe.  It can be
set to alarm when a given temp is reached, handy if you want an &quot;idiot
sound&quot; when it reaches 250 deg or whatever worries you! You should do a
check with boiling water before extending the wire to see if it has
changed.

&gt; John,

&gt; I am gonna take a shot at describing my experience with making a dip stick
&gt; temp gauge. I think it works great and cost me about $25. I believe there is
&gt; a post in the library by Mike Benthin, which is where I got the idea.
