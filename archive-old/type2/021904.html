Chris, are you sure the outer fly wheel was worn from the seal?  That is odd
(maybe not).  Anyway, the rubber o-ring problem you mentioned:  I had the
same issue.  I looked inside the fly wheel and saw no space to put the
o-ring so I assumed I had a &quot;special&quot; fly wheel that did not need it.
Needless to say, the motor leaked at the rear mail seal.  In fact, that is
the ONLY place it leaks (rare for a vw).  Well, I pulled the motor again,
tore off the fly wheel and upon closer examination, THERE IS A RUBBER O-RING
IN THERE!  It was so old and used that it turned the same color as the
flywheel and was flush with the groove.  If you feel in the recessed area
with a very small screwdriver or your fingernail, you will be able to tell
that it is softer that the metal.  I jabbed it with a screwdriver and it
came right out.  I pulled an all nighter last night to replace my fuel tank
sender and thought I would take another look at the fly wheel while it was
out.  I am glad I did.  Who knows, I might have one of the only leak free
VWs for a few months.  Hope this helps.  Check it again!

Hello All,

I have a 77 2l FI van with a similar flywheel problem.  There is a
groove in the outside of the flywheel hub (non-clutch side) worn from
the crank seal.  The groove is rather irregular and varied in depth (up
to maybe 1/4 mm).  It is from wear and not a machined in channel.  There
were no leaks from the front end of the case, even with this scoring.  I
imagine over time, there may be leaks, or at least the seals will wear
out faster.

I have a question about the o-ring.  On the inside diameter of the
flywheel hub there is a machined groove.  Does anyone know if there is
supposed to be a seal there.  I have a gasket set with an o-ring for the
flywheel that is too large for this location and too small for the
outside diameter of the hub (still all non-clutch side).  Am I correct
in assuming I have a non-stepped crank and flywheel and I do not need
the o-ring at all?  The cross section of the (non-clutch side) flywheel
hub goes straight out from the 5-bolt section to where the bearing
thrust surface is.  On top, the surface curves outwards as it goes away
from the centre.  The crank end is a straight cylinder back from the
bearing with a rounded end that fits into the flywheel hub.

          (Flywheel slopes away smoothly on top) 
          Wear groove from seal here

      What is this groove for?
