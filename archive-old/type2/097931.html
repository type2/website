Subject: 71 Head Light switch advice needed

Hello everyone!
I am on a quest for the perfect headlight switch.
I can plainly see who is selling these switches but who has the best quality 
for the money?
I have already discovered that the new switches are slightly different from 
the original in that terminal 57 is not present and I have worked out this 
issue.
I want one that will fit in the old hole and either comes with a new threaded 
bushing / nut or my old bushing / nut will fit on it.
I bought one from www.avolkswagenpart_dot_com thinking it would be a real bargain 
for around $25 including shipping but it does not include the nut and mine 
will not fit.
Please advise a good dependable source for this switch.
I think I also need an Ignition switch as I have fried mine twice while 
monkeying around with my old switch and a used switch I purchased on ebay.
Just the electronic portion not the lock.
Thanks for the guidance.
The barefoot Bohemian
