Subject: Re: Muffler leak

I have patched a very leaky muffler with the muffler patch stuff that 
includes fiberglass tape to overwrap it.  Muffler shops should be 
able to weld this for a couple of bucks.  Mine was bad enough that 
the muffler and pipe need replacing.  But I HAD to smog it and get 
rid of that Toy* truck with no more money dumped into it, so . . . 
quick cheap patch.  Nex owner smashed up truck 2 weeks later.

&gt; box itself.  Proper proceedure would be a little circular arc
&gt; weld, no doubt.  However, anybody know if there's a tube of
&gt; &quot;super goop&quot; that would seal this thin crack that DOES get
&gt; pretty hot ?
