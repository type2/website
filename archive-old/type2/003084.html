Subject: Grey wire with red stripes hanging there? 79 Westy

So I pulled the fuse box off to check the wiring on the wipers, and there
was a grey/red wire just hanging there that looked like it came off of the
fusebox(I'm assuming that's where it came from). I've looked at the
schematics but am not sure. There is a grey/red wire at the fuse2 connection
(on the top side of fuse) that is the same color.
The one that's disconnected goes into a black plastic wiring loom along with
a large red one, and a lime green one. These all head down behind the front
black cardboard fascia panels to god knows where.
Anyone know where that wire should hook up to?
Thanks,
Courtney
