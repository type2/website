Subject: Oil Puddles

Hi Everyone
 When I rebuilt my 2.0 the case was cracked in two places. I got them welded, 
but I missed one hair line crack. When I turn off the warm engine I have 
20-30 drops of oil on the garage floor. When the engine cools it stops dripping.  
I found the leak on the bottom by a fin. Does anyone know how to seal this 
crack.

Thanks, BW
