Subject: BugOn Monrovia MD Sunday

Just seeing if anyone is going this Sunday.  I will be there in my 75
Yosemite Yellow Camper trying to unload some of the junk from my basement.
Any locals want to split a space w/me! I think it is $50 for a 10 by 10.
Hope to see some listy' there.

Keep on bussin,

Patrick Flynn
