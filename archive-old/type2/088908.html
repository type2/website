I am currently disassembling a stock, 1982 Type 4 motor that apparently
suffered from lots of abuse (few oil changes, sat up for some years,
then was restarted, was operated (either) without the foam cooling-tin
seal in place, or with some tin missing, apparently NEVER had the valves
adjusted, had massive oil leaks for a LONG period of time, etc.). The
junkyard grease-pencil on it *looked* like it said 32,000 miles. On
clean up, it looks more like 320,000 miles (which I cannot believe).

I have the ability to take digital pictures of this motor, record
observations, and *could* post to a website if this is of interest to
enough folks. It is kind of a hassle, but I've also been where lots of
you T4 owners are, wondering what's going on inside the motor, and
wondering what certain types of failure look like. Pictures of shiny new
motors abound, failure pix are rare.

P-mail. If it's a handful of folks, I send pics p-mail in the coming
days. If it's heaps, I'll make a site.

Developing business and guiding change since 1996,
