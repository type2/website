Subject: Intriguing odometer problem

Dear list,

My UK 73 kombi has an interesting problem, that most would probably 
consider not a problem. After several experiments, I have discovered my 
mileometer reads low by 17%. I first became suspicious when the door to 
door trip to my parents came out at 230 miles. In hire cars I had used 
before (and my parents coming the other way) it was 275. I am fairly 
sure of the speedometer - we have lots of speed warning signs around, 
and the numbers they were flashing up agreed closely with my 
instruments. Yesterday I did a final test, and on a long straight 
stretch timed with a stopwatch 1 instrument indicated mile with the 
speedo showing 60. It took 72 seconds, suggesting I had actually covered 
1.2 miles.

What on earth is going on? The speedo cable is nearly new, and the 
speedo itself works well - no wobble, and appears accurate. And before I 
get too excited about not going over my classic car insurance mileage 
limit, has anyone else realised the major downside to this? Lets just 
say I've had the van for four years, and that's quite a few oil changes 
I have probably missed.

I can live with this problem - I plan to be buried with the van, so 
won't be selling her, and I can cope with the mental arithmetic. Still, 
it would be nice to have your insights into what is causing this. The 
mileometer has been messed with once. It was zeroed (from 97000, so not 
too far to go) when a new engine was fitted by the PO.
