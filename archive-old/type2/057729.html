Subject: RE: Electrical weirdness

&gt;You'd be surprised what sorts of electrical conductivity a spider 
&gt;can produce in there.  A little zap, a little puff of smoke, a whiff 
&gt;in the air like lobsters cooking.  Then everything is suddenly OK.   

You know, that's an interesting idea!  I did notice a bunch of ants
crawling on my handbrake lever the same morning it wouldn't start.  I
dusted them lightly with some Raid and didn't think anything more about
it, but that really is a possibility.

Thanks!
