[...] Check your battery connections first.  Get a terminal cleaning 
brush and some terminal spray coating at the FLAPS and get everything 
nice and shiny.

&gt; Hello hello!
&gt; 
&gt; Turned on my van this afternoon only to hear a not too pleasant &quot;click click&quot;
&gt; sound.  I have had my van long enough to know that this is probably an
&gt; electrical thing (battery maybe?).  How can I tell? What can I do?  I tried it
&gt; again just a while ago, but that time I didn't even get any dash lights!
&gt; 
&gt; Also... A while ago, my once fine working BN4 gas heater, well... stopped! It
&gt; seems to me that the fan itself just stopped, but heat is still possibly being
&gt; made... Just no fan.  Again, how can I tell and what can I do?
&gt; 
&gt; While I'm at it... any lock de-icing techniques that people have found useful?
&gt; I've been using hot water in the mornings... It get's pretty below zero up here
&gt; in northern Canada. 
&gt; 
&gt; Yepp... that's about it.  Thanks in advance. Happy holiday times! *warm feelings
&gt; to you all*

&gt; I think there should be something in science called 
&gt; the &quot;reindeer effect.&quot; I don't know what it
&gt; would be, but I think it'd be good to hear
&gt; someone say, &quot;Gentlemen, what we have 
&gt; here is a terrifying example of the reindeer 
&gt; effect.&quot;
