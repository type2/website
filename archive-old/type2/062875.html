Subject: Re: Old Tires

Well, it depends.  Are the sidewalls cracked/checked badly?  Any chunks
missing from the tread?  If no on both, they're *probably* OK, but why
bother?  Are you going to drive *that* much this summer that you're going to
trash your good tires?  Remember, these old nylon pups probably won't handle
all that hot.  Unless I had to use these, I'd leave 'em or give 'em to
somebody who's tires are bald. 

As for the blowout, I'd rather have one on the rear than on the front--you
steer with the front, right?  On Mrs. M. (who is getting a new set of Summit
Trail Climber LT 195/75/14's as I write this) the better tires have been on
the front, not the rear.

&gt;I purchased a parts bus last Feb which has tires on it that are in decent 
&gt;shape as far a tread goes and seem to hold air fine, but they are old.
&gt;I don't know how long they have been sitting (in a field) on this bus but
&gt;I suspect for several years.  They are the old nylon belted type I believe.
&gt;I would like to use them for the rest of the summer and save my &quot;good&quot;
&gt;tire for the winter when I really need them.  I this a totally stupid idea.
&gt;Has anyone had a blow out a 60 mph.  Does the bus handle that OK (like a car)?
&gt;Also is it more important to have good tires on the back or the front as far
&gt;as blow outs go?  
&gt;Thanks,  I will certainly take your responses seriously especially if I am 
&gt;putting myself or others in danger.
