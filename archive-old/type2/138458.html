Subject: '76 FI died -

Help, please.

1) Very old lately in Fairfax Virginia

2) New Battery, 2 months ago

3) '76 Fuel Injected California Stick is the vehivle

4) The '76 started this morning (08:30) IMMEDIATELY with just the turn of 
the key.  I left it to idle/warm up for 5 minutes while I did some running 
around stuff.

5)  The '76 left the outside parking space as normal, with a little 
hesitation the first half block.  About 1/2 mile through the neighborhood, 
the '76 started to STALL when in 3rd &amp; 4th gear.  I put the clutch in, and 
when I tried to catch the engine while still going about 20 mph, the '76 
would catch and then stall.  This happened about 3 times, and the '76 
getting down in speed.  I pulled over (coasted over) into a parking space.  
This is about 1 mile from the start.

6) Now it becomes interesting.  I was stuck 1 road mile from home, and *** 
the '76 engine would start and run for 5 seconds.  I could NOT keep the 
engine running.  After about 3 times like this, the engine would not trun 
over AT ALL!! ***** &lt;&lt;--  this is the problem...

I expect the battery is good (2 months old), but it is possible that the 
battery just lost power. (I walked back home through the neighbors back 
yards, just 1/4 mile as the crow flies.  I found that the battery in my '78 
was kaput.  I jump started that '78, and was going to drive to church.  I 
drove 1.5 miles and wanted to see if it would start on its own.  Nope.  I 
had to catch the '78 in gear and trun back home.  Back home, the battery 
read 12.0 solid volts, but it had no power.  The '78 is now on a 10 amp 
battery charge in my garage, and 2 hours later, it is still not ready.)

Ok, what's up with the '76??

Help.
