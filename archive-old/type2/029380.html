Subject: BN-4 Gas heaters- is one enough?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.3.96.981106193202.10683A-100000_at_terra.vol_dot_com&gt;

Hello All,
	I am installing a gas heater in my bus, the BN-4. I have two
working units, and I was wondering from all of you who currently have them
installed- Is one of them really enough to keep all the people in my bus
(really, truly, honestly) warm? 
	That's pretty much all I need to know. Also, please mention how
cold it gets where you are. I'll be driving in winter temps around the
Appalachain Mtns, and see some single digits a few times a year, but not
too much.

Thanks,
John Tracy
