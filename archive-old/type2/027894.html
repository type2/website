Well the 300-mile oil change tomorrow is gonna be more involved now.  After 
268 miles of pure pleasure driving the new camperbus, the new guy comes to a 
sudden stop in Friday night rush hour and instead of the hard pull to the 
left that I described this morning, it momentarily held steady and then 
wooosh! pedal to the floor.  The right rear wheel cylinder let go of it's 
life blood.  I vice-gripped the rubber line, topped off that tiny reservoir 
and limped home on the frontage road (firm pedal and no pull anymore!!).  
First call to the local parts place, again got the answer, &quot;Like we said 
yesterday, we don't carry ANY brake parts for your 68 Bus.&quot;  They can 
possibly order a new cylinder at $41 bucks a pop.  Ouch.  Sometimes I hate 
living in the boonies.  I guess I'll call the big city next.

Any advice to the new guy before he gets to work?  Somehow I knew this new 
relationship was gonna be fun.  By the way, this is a single reservoir 
system, huh?  Damn, is there an upgraded mastercylinder for these things?  
Panic downshifting was *not* fun at all.  Teach me to never drive it before 
I address all the issues again.
