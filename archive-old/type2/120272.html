Subject: Re: [T2] aftermarket door seals

Harry-
NO! Spend the extra money and get the German ones from Bus Depot..It is 
worth it, I bought aftermarkets first but ended up getting the German 
ones.  Wasted my money but can attest to the poor fit of the 
aftermarkets.   The Germans come from the original mold, have the part # on them and FIT.  Hope this helps!
