&gt;
&gt;It is certainly true that the carb and fan are sucking air out of the 
&gt;engine compartment. 

Yes, the doghouse fan, for instance, displaces about  35.000 Liters 
of air per minute at 4000 Rpm, and another 25.000 Lpm through the 
carb(s)... That's about 1000 L per second going through the engine 
compartment at 4000 Rpm... 

&gt;It is also true that the air scoops are 
&gt;sticking out into the passing airstream and ramming air into the 
&gt;engine compartment. 

Not on a pick up, and they have identical cooling systems. The later 
1600 Baywindow pick up sucks air for the carb through the right underbed 
chassis member, which is connected to a vent/grille on the right rear 
corner of the cab.

&gt;Moreover, the cross sectional area of the air 
&gt;scoops is considerably larger than the cross sectional area of 
&gt;the carb and the engine fan intake combined. The pressure of the engine 
&gt;compartment at any given instant will be some function of rate of air in 
&gt;divided by rate of air out. It is hard for me to believe that pressure is 
&gt;actually negative in the engine compartment when the bus is at freeway 
&gt;speed. 

My single cab has proven that there is airflow from under the tinware into 
the engine compartment. The engine bay is pristine shiny Grand Prix Weiss.
The (my) exhaust systems leaks, the openings where the heatrisers for the 
stock manifold protrude through the tinware are open. While driving around 
town, no problem, but after a small trip down the highway it has black root
deposit patterns, to call it that, on the insides of the rear fender wells, clear 
evidence of airflow from under the tinware through the holes, along the 
carbs, passing the fenderwells, hitting the front 'fire' wall, and into the fan 
and carbs, there are blacks streaks on the fresh white paint, it almost looks 
like an experiment to show the magnetic line around a magnet using iron 
powder. The engine room only gets dirty if I take it onto the highway. If there 
was positive pressure in the engine compartment it would be less critical to 
seal the engine compartment, other than to keep the pressure in there..  I've 
never been advised, or read about sealing the engine compartment so as 
to maintain the proper pressure at speed. It would also mean that by going 
uphill at low speed, with a considerable load, that the cooling system does
not reach its full capacity because the car is not travelling fast enough for 
proper cooling of a hard working engine.

&gt;I have definitely noticed that the output of my heater is strongly dependent
&gt;on my rate of travel, i.e. very low when I am at idle and more and more as my
&gt;speed increases. Heater air is also drawn out of the engine compartment by
&gt;the heater fan, then pushed through my leaky heater boxes and all the long
&gt;way up to the front of the bus. The speed of the heater fan does not vary.
&gt;The only other thing I can think of that might affect this system is positive
&gt;pressure in the engine compartment when driving at speed. 

I see what you mean..  but the heaterboxes are also connected to the 
cooling system, and get pressure from there... That explains the increase 
in air through the heating system as the car moves faster.

&gt;If there were negative pressure in the engine compartment at speed, as you
&gt;assert, then I would expect engineering solutions that put more cool air in
&gt;the engine compartment to enhance engine cooling. Things like extra air
&gt;scoops or bigger air scoops would enhance cooling. Why then didn't those wise
&gt;VW engineers do it that way? Why are these not popular after market
&gt;modifications?

These were 'popular' aftermarket items, Kamei made them in the past, 
for Bugs, Buses, VW used them on the Thing/181, and the have been 
copied by many fiberglass 'specialists'. The thing is, that there is almost 
no way that you can force more air through the stock fanshroud, that 
would take a considerable amount of pressure, and might even require 
special mods to the carb(s) (if VW would have designed it) the gearing 
is the variable that can control the ratio between cooling capacity/amount 
and engine load. I've read about testing being done to increase fanspeed 
by increasing the pulley size, the engine ran hotter because the fan 
required more Hp to be ran at that speed, but it did not flow more air 
through the stock system. (I've read it a while back, relying on memory). 
A plus for an overpressure engine compartment would be that it would 
make up for possible small leaks in the tinware and engine compartment 
seals. 


&gt;&gt; This is also why having ALL the engine tin and sealing rubber in place is so
&gt;&gt; vital. One small piece of tin missing (or rip in the seal) and your engine
&gt;&gt; temps shoot up.
&gt;
&gt;It is definitely a good idea to have all tin and seals in place if air 
&gt;pressure is positive in the engine compartment at speed. If air pressure 
&gt;were negative as you assert then I would expect missing tin on the 
&gt;leading edge of the engine to let cool air in and enhance cooling of the 
&gt;engine. 

The air coming in from under the car through the opening of a missing front 
breast tin would be preheated by the transmission.


&gt; Obviously it is also not 
&gt;good to let hot air leak back into the system in any way.

If the pressure is positive, small leaks would be less critical, and not 
let hot air in, but let cool engine compartment air out.

Just my $0.02  :-)

Brian.
