Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust stud question and carb info needed 


&gt; Steve,
&gt; 
&gt; Before you tap, tho... do try to thread in the 8x8 stud.  If it fits you

I tried. It's way loose.

&gt; altho since you got the old stud out, you are in trritory I usually do
&gt; not enter.

The stud was already missing when I pulled the manifold off. This is what
makes me uncertain as to what happened. I don't know if the missing
stud was an 8x8 that stripped out, an 8x9 that stripped out, or an 8x9 that
just came loose. If the first, I can tap it out and use an 8x9. If the third,
I can just install an 8x9. If the second, I guess I get to swap heads.

I'll find out soon.
