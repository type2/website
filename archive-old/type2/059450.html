No, that's the air correction jet.  The main jet is mounted horizontally in
the bottom of the carb's float bowl.  There is a large bolt-plug thing in
the side of the bowl that you need to remove, then you stick a flat blade
screwdriver in through the hole to loosen the jet.  Don't remove the large
bolt-plug till you drain the fuel out of the carb!  It's easiest to remove
the top of the carb first so you can see what you're doing.  There are 5
machine screws holding the top on.
