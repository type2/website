&gt;&gt; You might be able to have your cracked mainfold welded.  That is what I had
&gt;&gt; done to mine.  If it is a '79, it is stainless steel, so whoever welds it
&gt;&gt; must be able to weld stainless.
&gt;
&gt;I did not know that.

I have a pair of '79 heat exchangers (currently on E*ay) and they are not
stainless steel.
