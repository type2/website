hi
    just purchased a my first bus just lately...and i have the same problem.
the guy that had the bus b4 me just disconnected the horn and was going to wire up a new horn button on the dash.
however i saved it from that fate, and am still looking at hooking it up back to the steering  wheel (sans beeps) in the near
future when i figure it out...i  think i get a short inn the wiring when i turn the steering wheel....
later
