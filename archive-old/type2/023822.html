Subject: question on fridge, stove and sink in '78 camper

hey everyone,

Three quick questions:

1.  how long can I leave the fridge on?  Will the battery go dead?

2.  Where can I buy a new water pump for the sink?

3.  The propane tank may have a leak or need to be tightened in one spot, b/c when i turn the gas on, white fumes leak (hiss) out of the pipe running from the tank-- should I be able to show this by anyone at a propane shop?

Thanks in advance once again!

best,
peter
