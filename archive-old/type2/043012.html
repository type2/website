Subject: info on westys

Trying to find some information about t2 westfalia, say between 1971 through 
1979. Currently I am looking at purchasing what appears to be a 1973 but I 
can't honestly tell what, beyond the direction of the poptop would indicate 
a year. Now yes I know that I could just verify the VIN number and go from 
there but the bus is one and a half hours away and I am currently working a 
lot of overtime. The po that I am going to be buying him from is gone until 
Aug 22. So what I am rambling about is that I don't have a clue.             
hhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeellllllllpppp!
