&gt; Howdy,   After checking the archives I still need resolve on this.  My bus

as you can guess this is practically a religous war. but my personal
opinion only

I have had a number of aircooled my first being a 59 bug when I was in the
military when that bug was not very old.  my first bus was a 10 year old
1960 which barely had enough power to get out of it's way going downhill
with a tailwind. (but sure wish I still had that 23window deluxe)

my current bus is a 78 auto tranny bus that I have had 12 years and has
been a daily driver that entire time.

&gt; engine is getting rebuilt.  My new mechanic has insisted that hydraulic
&gt; lifters are the way to go.  But, I've only known solids, and am hesitant to go
&gt; with the hydraulic type.

I would never even consider solids on my bus, but

&gt;      #1: Need I be concerned, or will all be ok?

as long as it is done right, new camshaft designed for hyd, new lifters,
pushrods etc. you should not have any problems

&gt;      #2: Do the hydraulic type constantly make noise, such as when solids are
&gt; getting &quot;tight&quot; for instance?

only time mine make any noise is when the bus has sat for a few days and
then it is only for a minute or so.   however you don't get any noise when
they are getting tight either.

&gt;       #3:  I was told that the hydraulic ones never need adjusting....is this
&gt; true.._dot_can I really go the next 100,000 miles without doing my valves on a
&gt; tune-up?

well almost never might be a good phrase, I check mine at least once a
year but they haven't needed touching in a couple years. the first year
after the rebuild they needed a little tweaking but after that....pretty
much nadda.

&gt;     I've got to head him off if I need to stick with the original solid
&gt; lifters like my bus came with.........

your bus your choice, I'm sure you'll get more advice than you ever
wanted. hyd will &quot;float&quot; at high revs but does a stock engine ever see
&quot;high&quot; revs???

as always YMMV
