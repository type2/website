&gt;If anyone out there would be innerested in receiving a scan of the 
&gt;Earl
&gt;Schieb Blue, Hacked up 61 Single Cab 'mounted' on a 4x4 truck frame, 
&gt;email
&gt;me back and I'll send a .jpg image file to you.  Special thanks to 
&gt;Turbo
&gt;Thom for the scan!  Perhaps it's destined for the 'Bus Hall of Shame'!
