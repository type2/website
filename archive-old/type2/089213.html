Hi List,

     Ok Folks, in the years I've been on this and other list's I have =
tried to stay clear of these flame wars, but I just can't leave this one =
alone!

     Give me a break here.......Why rain on this Guys parade?........ we =
have a young man that took a bus that really needed some TLC in the =
worst way............. spent his time..............his money.......put =
in his sweat!        I'll bet every step of the way he was doing the =
very best he could.

     Think about the time &quot;You&quot; did some job for the first time, under =
trained, under financed, under equipped. How did it come out? I'll bet =
you stepped back and thought man that looks good!

     I wonder what Rembrandt's first painting looked like?          I =
love these guys that have the attitude   &quot;Its not enough that I succeed, =
everyone else must fail&quot;!
    =20
     I say good job Daniel, keep pitching, like you say you fixed the =
rust. Now save up for some good paint. Here's a though, from time to =
time paint stores will mix paint that the customer never picks up. If =
your not concerned with color. Call around to the automotive paint =
stores in your area, tell them you would be a buyer for any discounted =
paint they may have. Keep in mind the type of paint, the cheapest type =
depending on your area, will most likely be Acrylic Enamel. Also it is =
easy to apply, does not require a clear coat, you will want to use a =
hardener. All of these paint stores have a second or even third brand at =
lesser costs, so ask for that. You should be able to rent a compressor =
and gun at rental store.=20
     So, pay no attention to the &quot;Nay Sayers&quot;. Save your bucks and get =
after it when your ready. Remember, Mamou (very small town in Louisiana) =
wasn't built in a day!
     Good luck!

     Sorry Folks, I just had to vent a little on this one!
