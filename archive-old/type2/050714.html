Subject: [T2] 70 Camper

Thank you to all who helped with the transporter to camper question that I
had.  I just got off the phone with my mechanic (he's been doing to
restoration on the transporter), and he said that he located a '70 camper
that a friend of his has.  Says it's in pretty good shape, and the guy wante
$600 for it.  He is going to go over it tomorrow.  Everyone keep their
fingers crossed for me.  And if you have any info that I may want to know
about this year and model, please let me know!

Thank you once again,
Kyle
