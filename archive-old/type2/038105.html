Subject: Ignitor ignition system

Hey.  I've got an Ignitor that I got at a swap meet.  It's in the box,
but I don't know whether it's for a centrifugal or vacuum advance
distributor.  I only think they're different because they are listed
different in &quot;the real source&quot; catalog.  It's the only one I can find
right now.

    So the part number of my Ignitor is 1847 and it says it's for a
bosch 4 cyl.

    I've got the vacuum advance, and I'd really like my Ignitor to
match, so please let me know.

            Thanks,

                - dave -
