&gt; That is EXACTLY the setup I have.  Originally I ran 130 mains and 155 air

&gt; Tried 137.5 mains and they were way rich.  I think 132.5 would be about
&gt; perfect unless you live at elevation, in which case I'd use the 130's or
&gt; possibly even 127.5. 

I went outside and pulled the top off the right carb.  Is the main jet the
one that is at an angle to the horizontal.  If so, then its a 175, and big
enough to drop a basketball down =:O  No wonder its running so fat.  Can
these jets be obtained at a FLAPS?
