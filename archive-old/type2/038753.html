Subject: New Steering Wheel!!!
Content-Disposition: inline

Hi all. It's not often I post something to the list unless I have a need, but
this time I thought I would share a great find,IMHO. A few weeks I saw someone
mention that LeCarra made steering wheels and adapters to fit a 1971 bus. As
many of you know, I'm finishing up a custom resto on my 71 and the steering
wheel was horribly cracked. The way I saw it, I had 3 options: Have Koch restore
my wheel, find a used, uncracked one (yeh, right.), or purchase an after market
replacement that would compliment my bus. After doing a little research, I
decided on option 3. I ordered the LeCarra RV wheel in satin finish with a hub
adapter (available seperately.) It is a 16&quot; diameter wheel with a black leather
over foam ring. The thing that impressed me the most is that it installed
without a single problem!!! 10 minutes tops. The color matches the dash and
steering column well and the view of the instrument panel fits perfectly inside
the top opening.  I did have to swap the turn signal cancelling tab from the old
wheel to the new one, but the holes were already there for it. I did have to get
3mm screws to attach it ( I think the originals were 4mm.) The feel is great and
it's no problem turning the wheels. By comparison, the old wheel only looks
about an inch larger in radius. I certainly would recommend this as an after
market answer to cracked steering wheels to anyone not worried about it being
OEM. Of course, your mileage may vary.
