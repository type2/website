Subject: Re: [T2] add pop top to transporter

Hi Tim,

I am that guy.

The roof of the bus is the same from 68-79. You can weld early (68-73) 
or Late (74-79) westy roofs onto any year of bus. I chose the 74 roof 
because it offers a double bed upstairs, this was a must-have feature 
for a road-trippin family of five.

I converted a 79 transporter shell into a westfakia during the winter 
of 00/01. With a lot of help.  We cut the roof from a rustbucket 74 
westy and welded it onto the 79. The interior came from a 73 westy, but 
modified to a weekender setup instead of a full camper. The process 
took about 100 man-hours, including time to prep the bus for paint. It 
could easily be done in less time if you are more proficient in welding 
and bodywork.  Or even less than that if you were opting for the early 
roof.

Next time I do this conversion (Ha ha ha... AS IF!!!) I would use epoxy 
to bond the rood instead of welding it.

Have a look at my website, there's lots of pics. If you need more info, 
just ask.

&gt; Welding and body work is no problem.  I want ot know if it is the 
&gt; dimensions
&gt; of the two busses are the same.  If it is possible do I need to ge the 
&gt; westy
&gt; roof from the same year?
