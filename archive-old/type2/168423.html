Subject: Re: [T2] FI ?? low fuel presure??

Hi Bob,

Where on the fuel rail are you measuring the pressure?
Try unplugging the harness from the cold start valve (And also make sure it
isn't installed backwards) see if there's any change.

I once saw a malfunctioning injector cause a nearby pressure gauge to give
false readings.

&gt; put new engine in my 78 2L FI won't start, ?? ran fine before swap...fired
&gt; right up.
&gt;   thru the check list and find I can only get about 12psi,!! huh was
&gt; consistently at 35psi before swap.
&gt;
&gt;   pump runs, and I have a shut off valve so I could turn off the return
&gt; ring which takes the regulator out of the equation..  still only 12psi
&gt;
&gt;   have a spare pump but before I go thru that hassle is there any other
&gt; checks to suggest... just don't understand why pump would suddenly fail.
&gt;
&gt; plan on putting a hose on the ring where the presure guage is attached and
&gt; seeing if it will pump fuel or if the intake is blocked.
&gt;
&gt; any other thoughts???  (other than blowing up this _at_#$&amp;$ bus.)
&gt;
&gt; thanks
&gt; Bob
