&gt; I checked the online library, Bentley and VW's late bus shop manual,

&gt; the
&gt; spring plate relative to the body, but it doesn't tell us what the
&gt; bus's
&gt; angle to the road should be. I don't think I should go by the book
&gt; and plate
&gt; angle alone since (1) the rear is heavier than stock and (2) the
&gt; torsion
&gt; bars probably got &quot;softer&quot; with age. I just want to know if the
&gt; suspension
&gt; on my bus needs to be adjusted or not.
&gt; 
&gt; With the heavier flat-6 in the back, my bus sags *slightly*: I
&gt; measured 1.5
&gt; to 2 degrees. Is this within normal bounds or should it be perfectly
&gt; level?
&gt; 
&gt; Can also someone confirm if my calculation is correct, at least in
&gt; principle? If the distance between front and rear axis is, say, 5
&gt; times that
&gt; of the distance between torsion bar and rear axis (I didn't measure
&gt; that:
&gt; I'm in my office and making up numbers... as usual :-), then the
&gt; plate would
&gt; have to be adjusted by (roughly) 7.5 to 10 degrees (5 times 1.5,
&gt; resp. 2),
&gt; no?

It should be, according to Hooke's law, but unfortunately the real
world sometimes works differently than theory.

I tried to calculate a &quot;correction factor&quot; in a similar fashion and
ended up way too high.

Considering your heavier engine, you might want to add a couple of
degrees to the stock spring plate setting, then measure the deck angle
to see the result.  Unfortunately, this might involve a couple of
disassemblies to get it right.  When you change things, you become the
engineer! :)

I measure deck angle on a level surface with a level on the sill of the
sliding door.  I put a friend in the driver's seat to make the
measurement, as that seat has to be occupied when the vehicle is in
motion.  With stock parts, the deck comes out within a half-degree of
level.
