Subject: Re:Need size of nut that holds down the steering wheel

Adam,
    ...&quot;My threads are messed up on the steering column where the nut holds
down the steering wheel..........i want to buy a die, but do not know the
size...&quot;

If you can't get the nut started properly on the shaft, you probably won't
be able to get a die started either.  If you turn the die with it on
improperly you will do more damage and maybe never get the nut on properly.
Instead of a die get yourself a very small file that is triangular in cross
section.  Then go round and round the threads cleaning them up with the edge
of that file.  I've had good results with this method more than once while a
friend wound up replacing the whole steering shaft cause he tried using a
die.  Just be patient and keep working on the threads until the nut screws
down easily.
