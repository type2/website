Subject: [T2] Shift plate? (was Front Shift Rod Bushing Replace)


&gt; &gt;&gt;I got tired of the hard shifting and excessive rattle in the shift
lever,
&gt; and did the same, noting that the rear bushings were gone but I didn't
want
&gt; to pull the rod.  Shifting improved, no more rattles, and I suspect your
&gt; shifting may be worse if you did not get that little plate under the shift
&gt; lever in the right place to allow 1,2, reverse gear vs 3,4?&lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt; Seems like every response to my idea of replacing the front shift rod
&gt; bushing has mentioned the shifting being worse rather than better.  Could
&gt; all this be related to the &quot;little plate&quot; you speak of?  I've always known
&gt; of a plate down there of some kind and have always wondered if I am
missing
&gt; something like, as I have never - since I've owned my bus - had to push
down
&gt; while shifting into reverse; always just a smooth horizontal pull to the
&gt; left and smoothly down.  I just always thought I was lucky not to have to
&gt; deal with it.  Is this something I really need?
