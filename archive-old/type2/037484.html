Subject: Sourcing or making a bunk.

I've got a '73 westy (front 2/3 pop top) with a 3/4 rock and roll bed. 
This summer I plan to go walking in Scotland with a couple of friends
and, well, we're friends but we're not *that* close that we'll all cram
into a 3/4-size bed.

;)

I'm reliably informed that there used to be a bunk in the pop-top of
pre-74 westy, does anyone know where I can get one (hopefully in the UK)
or has anyone made their own?

Chris.
