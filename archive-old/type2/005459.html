&gt; &gt; Also I noticed there is a difference in rear brake shoes during
&gt; &gt; the 73 model year (my bus year) at chassis number 213 210 2497.  My bus is
&gt; 233 210 0455.
&gt;
&gt; You must ignore the second digit of the VIN number, as that just denotes
&gt; body type (camper, passenger van, cargo van etc.).  Which means that going
&gt; by VIN number, you _should_ have the earlier style. Also, my reference lists
&gt; a manufacturing month change of 12/72, so you might want to check it that
&gt; way as well. As you noted, neither guarantees anything completely as
&gt; sometimes VW switched things around, but your odds would be good.

Ron,
Sorry forgot to mention this in the first post my bus was made in Jan 73 .
Which would mean the later shoes with the vin number denoting the earlier
shoes.

This is why I needed to know the difference between the two.

Peace Brother,
