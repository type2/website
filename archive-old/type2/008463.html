Subject: condenser problem
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com


In preparation of my bus (76 2.0L FI) for trip thru southwest, I had
changed points, plugs, dist cap, air cleaner, fuel filter; all the
usual maintenance items that I feel comfortable working on. I had not
changed the condenser in the last decade because I do not own a timing
light and did not want to remove the dist. A few days later the bus
began cutting out on slight inclines at highway speeds. I immediately
suspected the FI system, the expensive stuff that I know nothing
about. A friend of mine that works on VWs suggested I change the
condenser. My experience with condensers is that they are either good
or bad, no in-between. If they are bad the points will pit really bad
and this had not been the case with my points. I changed the condenser
anyway and borrowed a timing light to reset dist. The bus runs better
than ever now. My lesson learned: buy a timing light and change the
condenser when I replace the points. Much better to learn this now
than when in middle of nowhere in south texas.

Speaking of south Texas and other remote places in the southwest, my
ininerary will take me thru or near the following: Sulphur OK, DFW TX,
Austin TX, Del Rio TX, Big Bend Nat Park TX, Guadalupe Mt Park TX, El
Paso TX, Douglas AZ, Nogales AZ, Tucson AZ, Phoenix AZ, Show Low AZ,
Alpine AZ, Las Cruces NM. I hope to attend the Bus show in Tucson on
27-28 March.

If any list members have info or recommendations about scenic spots
with low cost or free camping it will be appreciated. Also, any
information concerning VW parts/service along the way. I already know
about Earl Mann's Bug Shop in Ardmore OK. He is a good guy that has
helped me on several occasions with my bus.

TIA, Larry Collett, St Louis, MO.
