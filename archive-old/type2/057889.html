===================
My 77 Transporter (fuel injected)  gets to about 30 mph. &amp; then starts
chugging like it wants to cut out, I let off the gas alittle, (did I say
it's also a automatic!?!) to engage the next gear, then accels fine till
about 40 mph. then all over again!
Any suggestions??????
====================

Let me get this straight : You are accellerating to about 30Mph then you try
to shift? But you also write it's an automatic.

Now, I'm no rocket scientist but my automatic does the shifting all by
itself. I think I do know what I'm talking about because my other two buses
are manual and they need me to shift the lever.

However, if you rev them up they will all have some rpm where they don't
want to go any higher. It probably means that if you reach that rpm you
ought to have shifted up already.

Oh, I see you mean the automatic does not shift by itself. You need to help
it a little by letting off the gas.

The auto tranny has 3 speeds. 30 mph seems quite normal for engaging 1st to
2nd. Mine shifts to 3rd at about 50. Flooring the pedal makes it shift at
higher speeds. But the VW engines will not rev as high as 'normal' cars.
