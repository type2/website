&lt;snipped talk of 69 westy, etc.&gt;

My first bus was a 69, not a westy, but a cheapy we
bought from a fellow visiting relatives in town who
needed money and decided to sell the bus. It was rusty
with lots of dents and primer, some odd front seats,
and new CV joints and a strong engine.  We drove it
for years and loved it, but it was so ugly that
friends didn't want us to park near their house when
we came by to visit.
Learn all you can about buses and VWs by reading and
talking so that you know what you are looking at.  You
may be able to get a great deal.  Our current 75 bus
was $500 a couple of years ago, some surface rust,
broken windshield, and the guy selling it said it
couldn't be driven because of engine problems. I
bought it and had it towed home.  The engine problems
were major exhaust leaks (new heater boxes and muffler
fixed that) and a sticky hydraulic lifter (it has a 79
2liter engine) which wasn't too hard to fix.  Replaced
the clutch while the engine was out, and immediately
drove it across the state after getting it all
together and replacing the windshield.  
Just want to point out that there are some good
bargains out there, and that the more you know about
these vw buses, the better you can judge if something
is a deal or not.
Good luck.
