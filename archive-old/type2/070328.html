Subject: Inuvik update sort of; Mild(?) Mechanical woes

Greetings,

Some of you may remember me as the guy who slapped a new Mark
Stephens engine in his '80 Vanagon and headed off to Inuvik.
Well, I made it to Inuvik just fine, and am here in Fairbanks
after the splintering of the group in Tok.

Ever since I left I've had this uneven idle that I was chalking
up to a vacuum leak.  The VW dealer in Prince George couldn't
find it, but confirmed that the vacuum was 7&quot; instead of the 14&quot;
that it should have been.  After assurances that I was running
rich enough to avoid burning a valve, I pressed on with the
group to Inuvik.  (The engine still seems totally smooth and
peppy, except at idle--quite nice to drive.)

When I finally rolled into Fairbanks (Ah! Civilization and Pizza
Hut again!), it occurred to me that there was a VW dealer here.
Still slightly irritated with the mystery vacuum leak and rough
idle, I decided to take it in and let them look for the vacuum
leak.

The VW dealer here in Fairbanks said my compression was 75, 125,
125, 125, with the low cylinder coming up to 125 with oil, and
wanted to do a teardown to replace the faulty cylinder/rings.  I
almost went for the estimated $1,500 teardown, but thought I'd
check it out myself first.  Lo and behold, I came up with 110,
120, 120, 125--not perfect, but definitely not immediate
teardown time.  I can't decide whether the dealer mechanic is
dishonest or incompetent or what.  On one hand, I'd like to give
them a chance to explain; on the other, I don't really want them
anywhere near my bus now.  No wonder they were able to get me in
right away--the locals have figured out that it's a terrible
shop.

Friends here in Fairbanks recommended Midnight Sun Auto &amp; Truck
Repair as an honest bunch, so I took it in to the place, which
is surrounded by domestic pickups and tractor-trailer rigs.  I
wasn't expecting much VW expertise, but was surprised to learn
that the guy who was going to work on it owned an '80 vanagon
from '80 to last year, so I'm pretty sure he's familiar with it.

Well, he checked it out and says that there is a compression
leak on the suspect cylinder, and says he can feel it at the
cylinder-to-head mating, having removed the lower engine tin.
BTW, his compression numbers agree with mine pretty closely
(percentage-wise, not absolutely).  Oil in the cylinder doesn't
bring the compression up more than a pound or two.

My first question for the experts on the list is: Would a
head-gasket leak like this cause the low vacuum that we've
measured, and thus cause the rough idle?  Or should I still be
trying to track down some other source for a vacuum leak?

Also, what is the likely cause of the compression leak on such a
low-time engine?  I'll be calling Mark Stephens tomorrow to see
what they have to say, but it seems to me that they must not
have torqued the head bolts correctly, or one of the studs is
pulling out of the case already.  I had something similar happen
after a head replacement on my '72 bus by a normally excellent
shop in Seattle--I never figured out what the problem had been,
but put in a new head gasket over a tiny bit of erosion on the
head and drove happily for another 20K miles so far.

Other than the obnoxious vibration from a few washboards on the
unpaved bits of road, I've been pretty easy on this engine.
Should I just torque it up (to specs, I mean) and limp back to
California?  Pull the head and put in a new gasket if the
erosion isn't too bad and then limp back to California?  The
shortest route I can figure is about 1500 miles and involves a
$700 ferry ride (which would be partly worth it just for the
relaxation and scenery value).

Any advice appreciated,
Dennis in Fairbanks

P.S.  Surmountable mechanical problems or not, this has been
quite an amazing trip.  It was fun traveling with the other Top
of the World Tourists.  Maybe I can find Sue from Ohio here--I
heard she's here in Fairbanks.

P.P.S.  I've read of re-torquing the head bolts on a fresh
rebuild at 100 miles (with the engine cold).  But the literature
that came with the engine didn't mention anything about that,
just the break-in oil changes and how to adjust the hydraulic
lifters, in the unlikely event that that was necessary.  Someone
I talked to said the re-torquing applied to older engines.  I
think on '72s and later you have to at least remove the rear
engine crossmember and lower the engine/transaxle a bit to get
to all of the head bolts, so retorquing would be a bit of a
pain.
