Subject: Re: [T2] air scoops

So it's actually Ok to drive with the wondows down?  I don't see why the windows being down would cause any significant loss to the air scoops in the back...and plus they seem like they'd scoop the air pretty well, a lot better than the split windows vents were, at least that's what it LOOKs like, which isn't always what it is.
