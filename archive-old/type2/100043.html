Subject: Re: [T2] Rear Wheel bearing packing tool

Believe me, I thought over many different ways in order to find the simple
solution.  But in order to remove the old bad and sometimes even rusty
grease the only way is to push it out the back.  I don't think you could
drill enough exit plugs to get the bearing clean.

Those axle seals don't keep everything out and to do a good job, must be
replaced anyway.  It's not that hard to remove the gland nut and with a
brass hammer drive the stub axle out.  Then all you have are the two grease
seals and greasing the bearings.

&gt; Sounds like a great tool.
&gt; Has anyone ever looked at adding a grease nipple to the rear hub to be able
&gt; to grease the bearings without pulling anything apart??
&gt; I've thought about putting one grease nipple in the centre on the hub, and a
&gt; removable plug on the outside of each bearing. That way, you remove one plug
&gt; at a time and pump until clean grease comes out. I was planning to look into
&gt; this if/when I replace my wheel bearings.
