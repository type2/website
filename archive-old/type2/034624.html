Subject: Rant: Muffler Bolts

I was replacing the tailpipe on the '80 vanagon today
and all three bolts that held it on snapped off without
even being hard to do.

Why do they make it so they bolt into a muffler flange?
Why not a bolt and nut so that they are easy to cut off and replace?

I will prob have to drill them out all egg shaped now and try to 
squeeze the nuts in behind them. I have such a nice muffler
and such a bad tailpipe.

PS: I could also rant about 'quickie oil change' places that
put 5 quarts of oil into the type4 motor causing me to 
think that I blew out the rear seal. I drained a quart and it
is happy again. Now all I have to do is wait 6 months for the
stank to get out of the heater system.
