Subject: Little Light Bulbs

So, I ran out to Radio Shack to see if the small 'wheat' bulbs would be a 
good fit for my '78 instrument panel.

OK, they can be made to fit, but when I see these radio Shack 'wheat' bulbs 
burn next to my standard 1.2 watt bulbs, I see no difference!!

Off to Trak Auto, and the Wagner lighting display shows a pretty small bulb.

I bought a blister card of two BP74 bulbs for $1.49, and great balls of 
fire, they fit the standard instrument lighting bulb's housing like a 
glove!!

I just take the VW bulb+white plastic base out of the holder, and slip in 
the Wagner BP74 self contained single unit.  It is a bit longer, and quite a 
bit larger than stock VW

Oh, I called Wagner, and the technical support line says the BP74 is 12-14 
volts, 1.4 watts (vice 1.2 for stock VW) and draws .10 amps.

There is another comparable Wagner bulb, BP37, but it is a buck more for a 
set of two, and is rated for 12-14 volts, 1.26 watts(not enough to make a 
difference) and draws .09 amps.
