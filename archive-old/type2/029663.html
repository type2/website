&gt; thought of this?

I keep a gallon can there at times, sitting in my oil change pan.  Those
little gallon cans are very tough, and any rear collision that would
rupture it would threaten the bus's tank as well.  I've seen these cans
fall off of gardeners' trailers on the freeway and emerge scuffed but not
leaking.

I wouldn't do it with a bigger can, though.
