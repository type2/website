Hey all,

  Here in Minneapolis.  I have rear seats from a '72 bus, black.  They are in 
good shape, no rips.  Both the rear and middle seats. Free.  If you want them 
come and get them. Soon.  I hate to throw them out, but...  I'll be gone for the
weekend. E-mail me if you want them and we'll set something up next week.
