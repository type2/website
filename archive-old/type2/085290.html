Dan's Import Motorworks is in Oregon. They sell stuff on eBay. I've recently
bought a number of items from them, and they've been extremely slow to
deliver. My first order, about 6 weeks ago, came very quickly, so I ordered
a second time. When my stuff didn't arrive, I called every day for about a
week, and usually nobody answered. Last week, I finally got in touch with
Dan himself, and he told me he'd been in a bad car accident, and that his
assistant was running the store. He was very upset with her because she was
botching many orders, including mine. She lied directly to me on 2 occasions
about shipping my second order. When Dan was around, things were shipped
quickly. I'd keep trying to contact them, usually around early afternoon
Pacific time seems to be the best bet.
