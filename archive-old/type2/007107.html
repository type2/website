I think the going rate for a good late westy is in the 4k-buck range.  If
you add the cost of the new head or heads that this one seems to need them
to $3000, you're lookin' at about fair market value.

Correct me if I'm wrong on this folks.  I had a neighbor drop by with his
really nice '78 Westy and ask me what he thought he could get for it.  It
had recent heads, but also had a rust hole clean through the outer shell
under the windshield.  No floor rust, just that nasty bit under the
windshield.  Which is about the equivalent of a head job in cost (IMHO), at
least if it's fixed right.  I told I'd give him $2500 for it, if I was in
the market.

I can quit buying busses anytime I want

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; I'm contemplating the purchase of a 1978 Westy. The owner is a friend of
&gt; mine who bought it a few years ago and drove it some 5400 miles in one
big
&gt; stint and then parked it. No rust, new paint, new canvas pop top, just
had
&gt; it smogged in CA. He's asking $3000 for it.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's the snag it has this curious habit of consuming oil. To be clear
it
&gt; doesn't SEEM to burn oil (doesn't blow smoke, doesn't even leak when
&gt; parked). It just eats a quart or so every 300-500 miles.
&gt; 
&gt; It's had this nasty proclivity since my friend acquired it. As he was
&gt; driving all over the country at the time it made him a bit nervous at
&gt; first. En route he took it to three different mechanics who couldn't
really
&gt; figure it out. He says a VW guru in Moab CO told him just to keep putting
&gt; oil in it. Said he'd seen this kind of thing before. Suggested that
putting
&gt; in really heavy weight oil might solve the problem. As my friend was on
the
&gt; last leg of his tour he never got around to trying this suggestion.
&gt; 
&gt; Considering these facts is $3000 a reasonable price? The Bus is really
&gt; clean, runs well, original plaid upholstery. Doesn't have the stove/frig
&gt; package though just sink.
&gt; 
&gt; Should I kill the deal on principal over the mystery of the disappearing
&gt; oil? Worst case what's the going  rate on a rebuilt motor.
&gt; 
&gt; Final consideration I have to travel from Colorado to California to pick
up
&gt; the beastie.
&gt; 
&gt; Give it to me straight. I can take it.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt;
