Subject: Re: [T2] Engine bay cleaning

&gt;&gt;I really need to clean the engine bay in my '78, but I am a little
&gt;&gt; hesitant.  Does anyone have pictures of their engine prepped and ready to
&gt;&gt; be cleaned (ie, important parts tin foiled, bagged, etc)? Any other
&gt;&gt; suggestions, personal experiences, thoughts, ideas, would be great  too.
&gt;&gt; Feel free to respond off the list.

Here's the way I do it:

1. Take engine and transmission out, put in back of pickup, take to car wash
and pressure wash. I do cover the carb to keep from getting too much water in
there:

It helps to take all the tin off and wash it separately. A dishwasher works
great but don't let your mother or wife see you loading it!

2. Clean the engine compartment. Nothing in there now and you can climb
completely inside:

3. Put the engine back in, clean as a whistle. Now you don't have to suffer
with this problem when you work on the bus:

BTW, this method works great in other vehicles:

Seriously though, an engine drop does make for the easiest cleaning. I always
try to spend an extra hour in the engine compartment whenever the engine is
out. Each time I do it, the compartment gets better and better. Right now I
think it's actually cleaner than the driver's seat!
