&gt;  This is true- sorry if I've mislead anyone. I was comparing

&gt; the Pertronix (or other points eliminator) does get you
&gt; most of the benefits of electronic points but not all.

&gt;  When I reread the post it occurred to me that I hadn't made
&gt; it as clear as I intended that the CDI is probably the most
&gt; cost-effective solution. If you can afford both then by all
&gt; means get them (as I did) but on balance the CDI on it's own
&gt; probably offers more than the Pertronix does. I think Bob 
&gt; Hoover was of this opinion, too, which ought to carry a damn
&gt; sight more weight than my claim!
&gt; 

I have to disagree with some of this.
-The pertronix does not give any performance improvement but it does
reduce a significant bit of labor and improves reliability.
-CDI improves performance and electrical reliability but not the
mechanical reliability of the points so they still require attention.

I would first do points replacement and then CDI.
