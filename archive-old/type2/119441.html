&gt;Is this normal for there to be two different types of tubes? If so do I need a

Nope...I don't recognize the tubes with the creases in them. They don't look stock to me.

&gt;I can understand if these differed between intake and exhaust, but this
&gt;picture shows the exact order in which they were positioned. The larger tubes
&gt;were both on the left side of the cylinder. I'm new to type IV motors, but
&gt;aren't the exhaust valves on the outside and the intake beside each other on
&gt;the inside? If this is correct my theory of these tubes differing between
&gt;intake and exhaust doesn't fly.

On the Type 4 all the push rod tubes are the same dimensions. Each one has a small end and large end.
