Subject: [T2] top end rebuild ?'s dear lord... =(


&gt; I am having my top end rebuilt at the buslab in Berkeley this coming
&gt; Thursday and Friday. What are the questions I want to be sure and ask?
&gt; I don't know what should be included in that exactly, but the job is
&gt; going to run my about $1700 with rebuilt heads. The heads are supposed
&gt; to be a lot better than the AVP and the others I have found online, and
&gt; will run me about $280 a pop.

Boy, that sure seems awfully expensive if you're only talking about
replacing heads.  For $1,275 you could get an entire rebuilt engine from Bus
Depot (I'm assuming a TypeIV engine here).  Figure $300 for freight and
consumables and you'd still have $125 left over if you could do the work
yourself.  Use the $125 to buy beer for your friends that help!  :-)

If we're only talking about doing the heads, then I'd expect on a job this
expensive that you'd get all new valve adjusting screws and all new pushrod
seals as well and the new valve cover gaskets, new fuel injector seals, new
boots for the connections to the air distribution box and new gaskets for
the head/air distribution tubes interface.  I'd want to know about the heads
themselves, i.e., new AVP heads (sounds like it) or, if rebuilt, rebuilt by
who?  And the warranty on these things?

I'm never quite sure what's included in a &quot;top end rebuild&quot; but at that
price I wouldn't be surprised if it included new P&amp;C's.  If so, I'd want to
know if they will be doing a trial fit and measuring deck height or just
trusting that everything's OK and slapping the parts together.

&gt; Should this job include a new camshaft and matching lifters?

Since this involves splitting the case, I'd think it would not be included
in any definition of a top end rebuild.

&gt; We decided on a top end rebuild because the oil leak I have right now
&gt; appears to be coming down from the passenger side head, but probably
&gt; from the top two bolts because we tightened the bottom two, cleaned it
&gt; up and ran it again, and again I had oil. Plus, the bottom ones weren't
&gt; out of spec when we checked.

I'm confused here.  We're talking about some sort of air-cooled vehicle,
right?  As far as I know there's 4 top and 4 bottom nuts that hold the head
to the cylinders.  And the top 4 nuts/studs are outside the &quot;innards&quot; of
the engine so there's no way they could be leaking oil.  As far as I know,
most oil leaks from heads involves pushrod seals or valve cover gaskets.
Loose nuts on a head would result in poor compression and, I would think, a
characteristic noise.


&gt; The motor I have in it now has exactly 67,000 miles on it. It was sold
&gt; by VW of Canada as a new motor, but I suspect that perhaps it was an
&gt; official VW rebuild?

Probably, that's were VW rebuilt the TypeIV engines for the American market.

&gt; I have the part number :
&gt; VWA 039100031D/1 - NEW 2.0 75/79   - $747.29
&gt; VWA 039100031D/1 - NEW 2.0 75/79   - $747.29
&gt;
&gt; For a total of 1599.20, and this was in 1988.
&gt;
&gt; It looks like he got $100 back on a core charge from this.
&gt;
&gt; Then, I found another receipt showing &quot;install cust engine&quot; for a cost
&gt; of $400 in labor, and $86 in parts. The parts are listed as 4 manifold
&gt; boots and a gasket set.
&gt;
&gt; Does this sound like it was a whole new engine being installed, or just
&gt; heads, given the prices, part numbers and parts listed?

Whole new engine.

&gt; If the bottom end is actually the original original motors, and only the
&gt; heads were replaced last time, then the bottom end technically has about
&gt; 195,000 miles on it, and I should probably be replacing it as well,
&gt; right?

I'd say you have a bottom end that has 67K on it.
