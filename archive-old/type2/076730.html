Subject: Re: Water cooled H fitting. and Intake rubber

I also found part # 025.129.967 A, its the intake boot that goes between
the AFM and the Throttle body. 
I'm going to guess that this probably fits about an 86 WaserBoxer. It
won't fit my Air Cooled, thought it would. Its in good condition with
crankcase breather and vacuum adapter in place. I'd like to have $20.00
with postage paid in US.

&gt; I  was at the Vanagon bone yard trying to find a part for McCue, this 
&gt; is as close as I got 025.121.082. It looks to be an H assembly for 
&gt; coolant, never could find the part number for McCue.
&gt; Anybody want this good part for $12.00 including shipping (add $6.00 
&gt; if your in Canada).

&gt; Hello there...I am wondering if you can help me.  I have a 1984 VW 
&gt; Vanagon,
&gt; and I need a coolant hose connector.  It is &quot;H&quot; shaped, and is 
&gt; located near
&gt; the expansion tank.  Its part number is: 025 121 438.  If you have 
&gt; one of
&gt; these, or can get one, or can point me to someone who can, I would 
&gt; be MUCH
&gt; appreciative!!!
&gt;  
&gt; Thanks!
