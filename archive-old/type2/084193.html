Yeah, the jack points would be nice, but in my case they probably 
wouldn't hold the bus.  I just put the jackstands under the beam and go. 
 Gotta learn to trust your equipment, i think.  I've never dropped a car 
off of jackstands (but i have seen one come off a lift.  now that's 
scary).  Problem with ramps is that you're trusting the car to not roll. 
 I couldn't push my bus off the stands, but i sure could get it to roll 
down the ramps.  Ramps also leave you less space to work.  I leave my 
bus on jackstands all winter (cheap ones, too) and it's never fallen 
over, and we get some good wind up here.

well, that's what i think, anyway.............
happy trails...
