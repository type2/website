I've got mine attached to (screwed into) the wooden panel on the
compartment beneath my rear seat, to the left of the drop-down compartment
door.  (This is a Riviera setup, so may not apply to many.)  When I open
the sliding door, it is right there to the left.  It's outta the way and
not getting knocked loose by anything, and seems to be quite accessible if
need be.  I have thought of timing myself jumping from the front seat into
the back, unhooking the thing, and flying out the sliding door...next
weekend maybe.
