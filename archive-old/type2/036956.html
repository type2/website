Subject: Re: Push Rods

Yes, easy to fix. I'm with the other skeptics on the list. My good sense
and intuition tell me there's more wrong with this bus than the owner is
saying. Many of us have driven hundreds of miles for that illussive diamond
in the rough...only to find a lump of coal. It's all part of the quest, but
I would proceed cautiously. Check the library (www.type2_dot_com; then click
Library) for good advice and info you'll need.

Good luck. Hope it turns out to be a keeper.

&gt;Are you sure he said push rods and not push rod seals. Push rods are pretty
&gt;meaty items, but the seals are a regular failure and you then drip oil,
&gt;though its not fatal. They actually seal the ends of the tubes in which the
&gt;push rods run. Easy to fix though.
