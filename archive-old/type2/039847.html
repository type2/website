OK, think of electricity as a stream of water. Voltage (measured in Volts) is the altitude difference between the spring and the end of your stream. The higher the voltage the quicker the flow (current). Current is measured in Amp(ere)s. If you put rocks into the stream you introduce resistance (measured in Ohms). If you have little altitude difference (low volts) and lots of rocks (high resistance), you will get a pretty small flow (low current). High altitude difference (high volts) and few rocks (little resistance) will result in a pretty quick stream (high current). 
You can change resistance and voltage to influence your current, but you can not adjust current directly.

Ohm's law:
Voltage = Resistance * Current

Changing this equation yields:
Resistance = Voltage / Current   and
Current = Voltage / Resistance

If you have a light bulb (or any other piece of equipment you know the wattage of) you can figure out the current it draws:

Power (watts) = Current (Amps) * Voltage (Volts)
consequently: Current = Power/Voltage

Prefixes, such as K (Kilo) or m (mili) denote the order of magnitude:
1 KOhm = 1,000 Ohms
1 mA = 0,001 Amps
1 MV = 1,000,000 Volts (I hope you never encounter this ....)
1 micro (usually denoted by a Greek letter that looks like a y the wrong way around)A = 0,000001 Amps.

Hope this lets you brake even with your investment ....

&gt; Ok, all this tech talk about volts and milliamps and what kind of meter
&gt; to buy -- h_at_ll, I paid $20 for the one I've got, and I've got about $5
&gt; worth of knowledge to apply to it.
