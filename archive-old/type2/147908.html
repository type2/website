Subject: Re: [T2] Ride height - a warning

When I got my 76 camper it had just had new rear shockers installed. The 
first country trip at night I couldn't help but notice that the headlights 
were pointing much lower than spec. making it difficult and dangerous to 
drive. Therefore I suggest you check your headlight alignment if you make 
any suspension changes.

Martin.
