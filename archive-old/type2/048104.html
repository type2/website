I may need some metal replaced in the front wheel well of my 70
&gt; westy.  The rust is near the outter rubber side step.  Has anyone done
this
&gt; before?  It looks like it may be a BIG job

I just did that job and I'm a total klutz when it comes to bodywork.  You
need to remove the front bumper.  Look at the bus depot or RMMW catalog and
determine what you need.  I got the outer and inner step panels.  I don't
weld so I cut out the old rust with a sawzall and put in the new panels with
pop rivets. Make sure the mounting holes for the bumper are in about the
right place.  Do only one side at a time.  Finish off with bondo.  Oh, by
the way, coat the remaining solid but rusty metal with POR-15 while you're
there.  HTH
