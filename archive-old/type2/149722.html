Subject: East Coast Tow-A-Thon... get your beverage and BBQ here!

Well, I can't tow my 83 aircooled adventurewagen with either of my honda 
civic hatchbacks. (88, 94).  So, who's got something that can... how much 
beer and barbecue is it worth to ya?  I'm thinking at 50 mile stretches and 
some layover we can get it home eventually.  It is currectly at Pierce Auto 
is Bouckville, NY and it needs to go to Sicklerville, NJ by any means 
neccesary (about 325 mi).

Things I have to offer:
1. A discount on an 88 civic that runs well.
2. My services as a jewelry maker, have a wedding coming up? (gemstones and 
silver or gold- high quality)
3. Custom poetry for events and celebrations
4. Cases of beer and the best BBQ (for meateaters and vegetarians)
5. 27&quot; color TV that works perfectly
6. Handyman services (drywall, flooring, appliance installation, etc.)
7. Car detailing interior and exterior professionally done.
8. Instruction in riding a bike, swimming, literature, poetry, mythological 
discourse, sexual health...  (I'm a teacher)

Anything else you need?... let me know.

I figure just e-mail me with your name, e-mail, phone and where you can tow 
to and from so I can organize everything.  Thanks group.  It is a pleasure 
to be a part of this phenomenon. Regardless of how poorly I spell.
