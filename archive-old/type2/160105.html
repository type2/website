Maybe an easier, more practical alternative would be to practice
hypermiling. The king of the hypermilers gets up to 59 MPG (US) driving a
stock Honda Accord.

Seems like a person could take a VW bus from 18 MPG to 30 MPG by applying
some religion to his driving habits. It's not like getting honked at or
flipped off is anything new to a bus driver.

The other factor is that the lifetime environmental impact of a hybrid is
not as good as you'd think. The batteries and other components largely
offest the benefits of reduced gasoline consumption. Adding batteries and
wheel-drive motors to an existing VW bus might not really make it &quot;green.&quot;

Here's a WaPo article on hypermiling:

&gt; Hybridizing a type 2, while keeping the original aircooled engine,
&gt; should not be impossible but it will probably be difficult.
