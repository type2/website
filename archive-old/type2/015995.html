I have a surplus 8' twin bulb shop light and a 4-bulb 4' shop light for
FREE - only catch is you have to come pick them up.  I'm in the Sacramento
area.  Need more light for working on your bus?  Here's your chance!  

I know &quot;free&quot; is a bit much for these, but I have to get back what I paid
for them.
