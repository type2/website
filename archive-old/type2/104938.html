Subject: Re: [T2] dumb questions

Go back to the 1776 daily driver article in Hot VW's several years ago.

If you used a fairly mild cam, it can be done and actuall runs pretty 
well.  I have run mine(engle 100 cam) on a 2 barrel Holey, solex, and 
kadrons.

Solex was fine(re-jetted a little), but you lose about 10-15hp.
Holley was great(28mpg) but barbaric on the kick in when the progressive 
part was active.

Kadrons(with the right linkage!!!!) are civilized, refined and rev as 
far as you care to go.  Lots of pedal and power left at 70mph.

Ask about megasquirt fuel injection later in the fall!!

Cheers, dave

&gt; OK, folks.. Get ready for some dumb questions.
&gt; A. Can a 1776 engine be run with a Solex single carb of any type? (I do not
&gt; expect screaming performance, and I want to keep it as simple as possible).
&gt; B. Can a 1776 engine be retrofitted for fuel injection?
