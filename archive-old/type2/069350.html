Subject: Re: Backup lights...the continuing saga

Sorry, made a mistake I just caught, the wire comes from the coil not the 
distributor, I was a little sleepy and groggy from potatoes last night.

&gt; I don't know if automatics are differant, but all the VWs I've worked on 
&gt; have a wire coming off the positive on the distributer through the fire 
&gt; wall to a backup light switchh on the drivers side of the trans, then a 
&gt; second wire coming off the switch back through the fire wall to the 
&gt; backup lights, to the drivers side bridging to the passenger side, with a 
&gt; ground conection to the frame. the inline fuse should be between the 
&gt; distributer and the trans, its a big black plastic buldge in the wire.
&gt; 
&gt; If I were you I'd check you light bulbs, check the fuse, and hook up all 
&gt; the wires, if it still won't work, jump the two wires going to the 
&gt; switch, if it works then, your switch is bad. Happy to field any more 
&gt; questions.
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry for spelling, I'm tired, a bad speller, and full of mashed potatoes!!!
&gt; 
&gt; HAPPY THANKSGIVING EVERYONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
