Subject: RE: [T2] A moment of silence, please

Sorry for your loss!

&gt; As my 68 single cab parts truck is hauled away to the crushers. And another&gt;
classic VW gets melted down to be recycled into forks and dildo motors. She&gt;
gave her all, she did - all the trim, engine and tranny and interior, not&gt; to
mention 40 years of service, which is damned good. I doubt too many 2007&gt;
Dodges will be around at the midpoint of the century (we'll all have&gt; jetpacks
by then, really).&gt; &gt; But she had to be scrapped. I was fighting with a
seatbelt bolt this&gt; morning, so I grabbed the belt and leaned on it. The belt
pulled off along&gt; with a chunk of rusted sheet metal :)
