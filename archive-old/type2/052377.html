Subject: [T2] intake manifold, again
&gt;Thanks to everyone who replied so promptly.  I wasn't  clear in my previous
&gt;post. It is the center section, not the end castings that I found different
&gt;part numbers for '71 bus and '71 bug.  Any further ideas on why this might
&gt;be?

The 71 bus used a 34-pict-3 carb as well as did the 71 bug.
The previous carb for both was a 31-pict-3.
It would appear the confusion is in regards to the fit of alternators.
Dave
