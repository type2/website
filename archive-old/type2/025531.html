about a month or two ago, there was a sort of &quot;how to convert your passenger
Vanagon into a Westfalia manual&quot; in German on ebay.  i'd intended to bid but
forgot.  i didn't track the auction and have no idea who, if anyone, won the
auction.

if the new owner of this manual is a list member or anyone here knows
him/her, i'd appreciate it i could be put in contact with them.

i'd like to borrow the manual, scan it, and make a complete, high quality
PDF available to the members of the list.  i would post it on my webspace,
so there'd be no need to request it, or we could just hand it over to the
administrator of vanagon_dot_com.

i would of course be willing to give some sort collateral (a money order
security deposit, or possibly my 18 year-old Bentley manual 'though it MUST
be returned', etc.) beforehand so the lender could have a some piece of
mind.

i'm a multimedia specialist, and i have access to amazingly high quality
scanners.  i could have it completed and posted within a day.

eventually i was hoping maybe to get a old friend of mine who's fluent in
German to translate it, but first things first.

thanks,
jason
