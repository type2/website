Subject: Re: [T2] FRIDAY - Water Injection System

I've also heard of this being done. A friend of a friend of mine has used a 
pump, and a mist system over the cylinders of his type 1 engine to acheive 
cooler temperatures. This (to me) doesn't seem as potentially effective as 
cooling the oil however.
My theory is to use a similar method as to what CPU overclockers use to 
achieve lower core temperatures in their PC's. This theory involves running 
external oil lines from the oil pump to a copper coil, which could be 
submerged in a water reservoir. The water in this container could be cooled 
via a peltier. For those of you who dont know what a peltier is: a peice of 
metal that runs on electricity (12v usually), that generates great heat on 
one side of the metal and very cold temperatures on the other. Place 
heatsinks on both sides of the peltier - the cold heatsink submerged in the 
water, and the hot side exposed to dissipate the heat.
Total cost you may ask? Around $60, including fittings, copper, and peltier.
I haven't tried this idea, but it's so simple and potentially VERY effective 
that I do plan to in the near future as things get hotter here in AZ.

Just some thoughts to help stir the creativity.

&gt;
&gt;Yes - this popular with the performance Corvair crowd.
&gt;
&gt;Might be useful on the hills.
&gt;
&gt;They spray it into the engine fan.
&gt;
&gt;Check Clark's Corvair for the parts. They are on the web.

&gt;&gt;Hi Folks,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I was thinking again (always dangerous) about helping the aircooled engine
&gt;&gt;run cooler and came up with an idea that I wanted to bounce off of The
&gt;&gt;List.  In lieu of spending up to $250 for an external oil cooler and
&gt;&gt;dealing with the mounting and thermostat issues, I was thinking about
&gt;&gt;alternatives that help keep the notoriously-hot T4 engine cooler.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I was driving in the rain yesterday, and noticed that my engine temps were
&gt;&gt;much lower than they usually are on this same route.  I got to thinking
&gt;&gt;(see first sentence) about the cooling and evaporative effects that water
&gt;&gt;has on the aircooled engine, and wondered if the &quot;rainy day&quot; condition
&gt;&gt;could be replicated on dry days.  I live at 8,000 feet elevation, and the
&gt;&gt;air up here is very dry and pretty thin, so its cooling effectiveness is
&gt;&gt;not as great as it is in thick, humid air environs.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;My &quot;rainy day&quot; theory is that road spray on the bottom of the oil sump
&gt;&gt;adds more cooling, which makes the oil cooler.  Also, the increased
&gt;&gt;humidity (both from rain and road spray) gets pulled into the fan where
&gt;&gt;its evaporative effects add more cooling to the cylinders and oil cooler.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I came up with the idea of a &quot;water injection system&quot; which goes something
&gt;&gt;like this:  A windshield washer reservoir on the left-side battery tray
&gt;&gt;with a low-pressure pump that could be actuated by a momentary switch on
&gt;&gt;the dash.  A hose runs from the reservoir to the tin in front (RIF) of the
&gt;&gt;fan, where water would drip onto the tin and get sucked into the
&gt;&gt;fan.  Water droplets would either flash into steam or get atomized by the
&gt;&gt;fan, get blown over the cylinders, and add humidity and density to the
&gt;&gt;cooling air.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;It all seems to work (in theory), but I'm sure there are problems with
&gt;&gt;localized cooling and different rates of metal expansion and contraction.
&gt;&gt;Anybody care to jump in on this one?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks for listening,
