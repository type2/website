&gt;...&quot;will do compression test when we change the oil&quot;...

I'd do the compression test now (especially since you have nice weather) and
then do it again after the tune-up--particularly if you plan on adjusting
valve clearance, etc. The pre-tune-up test will give you additional data to
help you understand the condition of your engine. Also, don't forget that
you must warm up the engine to get accurate results from your compression
test. Many people (including myself) also prefer to change oil on a warm
engine to theoretically get more of the suspended junk out of the engine.

&gt;Thanks again for all the help - especially Bob (Veeduber) who provided
&gt;step by step idiot instructions for me that should get added to the Muir
&gt;book!

I would agree that Bob Hoover fills a deep void of expertise in the world of
VW literature. He's come to the rescue of many a novice (including me).
IMHO, however, Bob is a *much* better writer than Muir ever was. No
disrespect toward Muir intended. His focus was on keeping VWs *alive*; Bob
goes much deeper than that...and as a writer myself, I simply prefer Bob's
style.
