Subject: Type IV head replacement?

This weekend I checked the compression in my new '78 camper:

Cylinder 1: 90 psi (Upped to 100 with a few drops of oil -&gt; rings)
Cylinder 2: 0 psi
Cylinder 3: 120 psi
Cylinder 4: 114 psi

Number 2 offered no resistance and the engine turned over quickly.

I took it down to the local VW expert and he said I probably have a
burned valve and recommended replacing the entire head ($250 for the head
and $400 for the labor, yikes!).  I asked if it's just a valve why replace
the whole head and he said he'd have to grind down the old head and that's
just as expensive.

He also offered (since the mileage on this engine is unknown) to replace
the entire engine for a new one for $2000 ($1600 parts/$400 labor).

In light of the decent compression on one side and the poor compression
on the other, would it be better to fix only the bad side or would I be
better off in the long tem with a new engine?

Or is this mechanic pulling my leg?
