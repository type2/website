Subject: Re: [T2] \What gauge is the wire??

For what you are proposing: Look at the gauge of the
batter cable existing. To run all the way to the
driver seat you will likely need to about double the
size of that wire. 8 gauge or 6 gauge does not even
come close.
Now if you want to disconnect everything except the
starter circuit, that MAY be prectical, but I suspect
you will still need heavier gauge than 6.

Why not INSTEAD look into a remote battery cutoff?
They do exist. Keep in mind that if you kill
everything that your radio presets will go away also. 

I have a &quot;normally closed&quot; (on) relay in my power to
the ECU in my bus. I can touch a momentary switch or
flip a toggle switch and have the relay activate,
which in my method of wiring it cuts power to the
computer effectively stopping all power for the engine
to run, and kills the fuel pump relay as well.

I did not want have this master relay always &quot;on&quot; that
is, the electromagnet holding the contacts closed, but
relays have gotten so reliable that it really is not
an issue.

Look for remote battery disconnects in places like
marine supply (West Marine) Racing supplies (Summit
Racing) Aircraft supplies (Aircraft Spruce &amp; Specialty
Co.)

&gt; OK, i am just waiting for the coffee to perk, and I
&gt; have this bugging me:
&gt; 
&gt; I want to put a battery cutoff switch at my driver
&gt; side seat pedestal base
&gt; (like a boat battery cutoff) to disconnect the
&gt; battery ground .  This means
&gt; running an appropriate cable from the VW bus (RBC)
&gt; battery negative ground
&gt; to the front of the bus and from the switch to a
&gt; ground spot up there.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, this wire will have to be about 11 ft long, so
&gt; I  went to Home Depot
&gt; to check what they had.  They had a reasonable sized
&gt; and flexible wire with
&gt; multi strands.
