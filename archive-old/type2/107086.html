Subject: Front sway bar mounting

I'm trying to wrap up my sway bar research and I was wondering, how do
people mount the front sway bar? The bushings for the 7/8&quot; bar look like the
normal bushings just with a bigger hole, but the stock clamps, which I don't
want to re-use, look like a PITA to install.

I there a t-bolt clamp or similar that can be used on those tapered
bushings? I noticed at aircooled_dot_net the same installation difficulty
comments are mentioned shown beside the stock clamps and they recommend
their SS kit.

Does the link pin of ball joint clamps work on a bus or what do people use
when the clamps are not included in the sway bar kit? For example, the RMMW
kit doesn't seem to include front mounting hardware.
