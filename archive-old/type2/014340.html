Subject: Re: [T2] Oil pressure sender, 914 oil temp sender plate and vacuumport

Al,

I think you are correct... the cooling air loss *is* considerable from the
oil pressure sender, but the fact remains, I have never seen a proper boot
installed.  The part is certainly available.  I am certain it can be
obtained from any of the vendors on the list (I got mine thru Bus Depot),
or any VW parts place.  I have seen one, heck, I have one that I ordered
for the '80 before I got into &quot;tin carving&quot; but it would take considerable
modification to get it over the size pipe I was sold as an extension to
raise the sender above the distributor.

Now if you want a *hard* cooling air gasket to find (at least in any
decent sort of shape...  Did you know that there is supposed to be a &quot;D&quot;
shaped gasket where the oil fill tube passes thru the tin on a Vanagon?
It is very &quot;NLA&quot; AFAIK and the examples I have seen in junkyards (one of
which is installed on my vanagon) are not exactly confidence-inspiring.
For whatever reason, VW did not use an oil-resistant compount on this
gasket that gets oil poured all over it by times :-( Between the heat and
the oil soakage, every example I have seen looks like a licorice
gummi-gasket.
