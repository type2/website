I would like to add a pair of seat belts to the forward facing bench seat in the rear of
my 1977 Devon conversion van. The seat is just in front of the rear axle and there are
two pairs of unused bolt holes behind the back of the seat that would work for one set
of mounting points but where can I put the others? I'll make do with lap belts if I have
to but would like regular 3 point retractable ones if possible. If it is a real pain does
anyone have other ideas to stop passengers rattling round the cabin?
