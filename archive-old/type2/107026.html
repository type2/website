Subject: Re: [T2] Tire Data Sticker?

From: &quot;Karl&quot; &lt;aufever_at_prodigy_dot_net&gt;
&gt; Sounds like you are confusing the vehicles recommended air pressure with
the max air pressure listed on the sidewall of a tire.
&gt; NEVER set your tire pressure by the max pressure on the tire.
&gt; ALWAYS go by the tire pressure listed in the owners manual or on a sticker
on the vehicle.

Okay, I understand what you're saying.  But my tires are rated at 45 psi.
If I set the fronts at 30 psi, they'll be 14 psi under the rated pressure,
and the rear will be 4 psi under the rated pressure.  This is okay?  It sort
of goes against everything that I've known about tires (not that that's
much), but if the list generally seems to believe that it's the right thing
to do, I'll comply.  Weird though...

G has these on him currently (came with G, and are in nearly new condition):

Toyo Spectrum Touring Radials
P195/75R/5R14  92S
Tread Wear 580
Traction A
Temperature B
Load Rating 635/1400

BTW, I know that 1400 is way low, but new tires are over our budget at this
time and G is nearly empty without back seats or cargo, just us and
groceries sometimes.

Thanks!
