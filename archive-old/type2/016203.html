I usually hate worn out threads, but this is a vastly important issue.
Assuming my oil temp gauge is correct, my bus runs like crap at 170-190.  It
runs significantly better between 200-220, but I start taking measures to
cool down when I reach 240.  I can't imagine driving all the time at
170-190.  I hear a lot of people say that you should be able to comfortably
pinch the end of the dipstick after driving a bus that is cooling properly.
To them I say try pinching a dipstick that has been boiling in water at only
212 for a few minutes and tell me how comfortable that is.  I have even
tried pinching the dipsticks in my water cooled Jeep Cherokee, Nissan
Frontier, and Pontiac Grand Prix and this old wives tale is simply garbage.
If you can pinch the dipstick you are running waaaay too cool.  Take care.

Subject: [T2] Oil Temps


Since I plan to put an oil temp guage on my 74 bus, I have been following
this thread with interest. As near as I can summarize, oil temps need to go
above 212F in order to drive out moisture, and temps of 220 - 240 are pretty
much OK.

Now for the monkey wrench: as I was tinkering in the engine compartment of
my bus last night, I noticed the remains of a spec sticker on the fan box.
This is a 74, originally set up with a 1700 engine that, according to the
sticker, met all emissions requirements in effect for CA. It gives the
timing as 10ATDC and then says: OIL TEMPERATURE 170-190F.

That seems awfully low to me. Any opinions?
