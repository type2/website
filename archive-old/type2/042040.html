Subject: alternator, oil cooler, DONE!

Volks- I just came in from installing a '75 alternator into a '74 bus.
You wouldn't think it would be that big of a deal, but the new one seemed
to be bigger, the cool air hose had to be turned from a half circle into
a full circle, and I had to figure out the wiring. I did it all
correctly, and I'm quite proud of myself. Thanks to those who responded
to my alternator questions I posted earlier in the week. 
I also installed an oil cooler. The oil seems like it has a long way to
travel, but my engine didn't starve itself of oil and my oil light goes
out as soon as I start up the bus. According to the Bently Manual, the
oil pressure switch is after my fliter and external oil cooler. That
should mean I have good pressure. 
	Unfortunately, I have two oil leaks. One is from a push rod tube,
and I know how to fix that, I just have to do it, but the other one LOOKS
like it's coming from my oil pressure relief valve (back of bus, driver's
side). Can this be possible? I mean, I've NEVER had oil leaking from here
before, and I've never heard of anyone leaking oil from here before.  How
do I check to see if it is leaking, and how do I fix it, if it is? Just
for the sake of argument, I see the oil filter flange gasket, the gasket
that goes between the block and the arm that the oil filter attaches to,
right above the oil pressure relief valve. If this gasket is the culprit,
would it be possible to replace it WITHOUT taking the engine out? Can
anyone who has done this before let me know, please? Thanks again for all
your help.
