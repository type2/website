Subject: Re: Lookin into 77/78 Campers

A friend and I discuss this often.  We don't like 77s, and we don't
like 79s.  It's generally agreed that 67 and 71 were &quot;good years&quot; for
buses.  I think 78 should be added to that list: the last good year
for buses.  2.0L, FI, hydraulic lifters, no cat (at least outside CA),
sliding side windows.

Just my $0.02,
Rodney
