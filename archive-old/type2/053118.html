Subject: Weber Carb

Last summer I was given a 1978 Bus - free! ( It belonged to a student of
mine,  I teach art at a small university in Southern Utah - he got an &quot;A&quot;.)

Story goes- (long story short) it was sitting in he parent's backyard for 10
years, after an engine rebuild and a F.I. to carb switch-over. The carb was
stolen and so it sat for a decade 'till I picked it up. I located a new
Weber DFEV, bolted it on and after two turns it fire right up! After a
summer cosmetic repairs and general maintenance, it runs great...EXCEPT...
I continue to foul plugs. I have 130lbs the whole way 'round, new Bosch blue
coil and wires, points....timing is on. I'm at altitude so I jetted down to
the point of gas starvation, then back. I have a low pressure bellows fuel
pump. I think it's NOT the carb. All the hyd. lifters seem fully pumped.

I bought a  complete fuel injection from a LIMBO member this winter- ECU,
air cleaner, the works. It was running on the Bus he took it off of but I'm
missing the F.I. fuel pump, and the temp sensor looks stripped.
Even though its a late model, I'm a restoration freak, so I can see
eventually the F.I. going back on.

BUT in the mean time, I have a Bus that seems to run great - except for the
fouling and its really only bad on #4.
The fouling is black and powdery.  The #1 plug is perfect. #2 shows a little
carbon where the electrode meets the threads. #3 Is acceptable but worse,
and # 4 needs a bi-weekly cleaning or it will foul. I'm using Bosch plugs.
After setting the hyd. lifters as per Haynes, there is still valve clatter
on the #3,4 side. I'm going to drop the engine to replace leaky seals
 thanks all for advice on &quot;engine drop&quot;) so I'll probably take a look-see at
the 3-4 head.
Any one else have experience w/ these Webers? Any Ideas?
