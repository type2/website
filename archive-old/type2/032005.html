Travis:

If you want to get that thing off sometime this year I'd advise using a 
little more that light hammer-taps.  The drum is quite sturdy and you're 
hitting it (I hope) right at the perimeter of the drum on its flat face, 
where two planes of metal meet.  If you have a small one-hand sledge us 
that and gradually up the &quot;oomph&quot; behind the blows.

&gt; that damn thing off all day long with no luck -- it's stuck tight and very
&gt; stubborn.  Looks/feels like it's rusted around the hub area.  So, I've
&gt; semi-patiently been Liquid Wrenching the area and lightly hammer-tapping
&gt; the face of the drum in hopes of freeing it sometime soon.
