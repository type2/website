Subject: '71 Pulley size

Hello list,

	My newly acquired '71 bus has a non-stock pulley that has degree
marks all around it.  I love the marks but am fearful that the pulley may
not be the correct size for a '71 bus.  Does anyone know what the diameter
is supposed to be for a '71 pulley?

	Also, while I have your ear (or eye, I guess), there is an
alternator instead of a generator installed in this bus.  Is the altenator
stock for a '71 bus or did the PO replace a generator?

	The reason I'm concerned is the bus is running on the hot side.
Compared to my '70 bug, the bus' pulley looks smaller and its altenator
looks bigger than the bug's generator.  Wouldn't that mean that the bus'
fan is running slower per engine rpm than the bug's, and therefore,
providing less cooling?

Thanks for any help,
Adam Rechs
