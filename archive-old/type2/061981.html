Subject: Generator woes

Hey Volks, 

        I was able to look at the generator and regulator on Ras Bulli
Split yesterday.  It hasn't been charging all week...except for one
brief moment on Wednesday morning when the ammetre showed some
activity ;)  I could only perform the voltage test as my multimetre
can't cope with the number of amps that &quot;should&quot; be involved here.
The preliminary results do not warm I with encouragement...with the
engine running and everything in it's place, there is a small voltage
at the generator terminals...save it appears to be coming back through
the regulator to the generator... I stop the engine, disconnect the
ground strap, then the generator, start the engine up and try
measuring the voltage off the generator without the regulator...nada
:(

I pulled the brushes and they look fine, and the commuter doesn't look
burnt anywhere.  I checked the terminal wiring and cleaned the
commuter and brushes.
I then pulled the regulator and cleaned all the contacts and traced
all the wires from end-to-end...everything is connected properly.

It looks as though I will pulling the generator this afternoon [yeah],
as something must be wrong deep inside...though any visual evidence of
a burnt armature is not there.  It is a little disconcerting that it
was working fine last year, but decided not to come out of winter
hibernation. 

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!

Roy
