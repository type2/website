Subject: Pedal Seals

The ones VW is currently selling are a rubber disc that goes around the
shaft and presses agains the underside of the floor when the pedal is not
in use.  I have also seen similar items at meets.  I don't particularly
care for this style of seal.  My solution was to get a sheet of the
sticky-back foam for insulating and cut a slot and circle in it, stick it
to the inside of the floor around the shaft.  I feel I get a better seal
that way, but YMMV.
