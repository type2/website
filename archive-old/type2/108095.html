Subject: Gen light on??

Ok I have made progress with my 71 Single Cab...  :)  Generator light stays
on all the time but.... Goes out if the belt is taken off.  So basically
turn the key to on position (no light) running bus (light stays on)  take
belt off (light goes out)  AS far as we know the voltage regulator is wired
correctly (according to Bentley with a new wiring harness)  It has a new gen
and new regulator and the light has always been on since even before
rewiring and replacing the gen and regulator.  But The new hopeful thing is
with the belt off the light at least goes out so I have a warning of when to
pull over.

Any ideas what might be backwards??

Thanks so much for all the help so far...

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
