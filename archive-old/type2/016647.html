Subject: Re: best way to ship two pallets of VW items?
References: &lt;199811270519.WAA27406_at_yiff.azaccess_dot_com&gt;

&gt;What's the most cost-efficient
&gt;way to accomplish this?

&gt;One shipper wants $1,000 (for $400
&gt;of parts!?) to move two pallets from
&gt;Ohio to San Diego

Michael:

I'm guessing that it's quite a bit of weight, but perhaps if you broke
it down you might be able to ship it UPS.  They'll go up to 150 lbs.
now.

They've got a page at http://www.ups_dot_com/ which will probably give you
rates and other info.

Giff
