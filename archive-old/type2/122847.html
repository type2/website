Subject: Friday case question.

   I am trying to see how many miles any of you might have on an engine in
your bus that has had the case align bored 40, 60 or 80 over. Please no BS
of I have 100,000 miles on my 80 over, 30 under crank, double thrust case,
pulling my trailer, 4 kids and 3 dogs back and forth across the country in
the middle of summer, unless it's true.


ronnie  TIA
