&lt;&lt; We were at my friend's VW shop today and we saw a
 late 70's Bus with a lowered floor.  My kids said the middle
 floor section was lowered about 4-5 inches.  It wasn't a pop-top,
 but seemed to be a camper, although I'm not sure if it was
 a Westy or some home brewed conversion.
 
 Was a lowered floor a factory option, or was this a custom job?
 
 Thanks

My brother in law had a brown '77 or '78 bus like this.  The floor was about 
six inches or so lower.  This one was setup to be used by a wheelchair bound 
person.  There was a ramp that flipped down once the door was slid upen.  It 
didn't appear to be a backyard conversion, but appeared to have been done by 
a conversion shop.
I should have looked at it closer, but that was in my V8 Detroit iron phase.
It was junked, along with a Westy of the same vintage, by a buggy-builder 
(niether one was worth much)
