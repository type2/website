&gt; Not too hard to do.  The worst you can do is to get it up on two
&gt; wheels, To this you can add the momentary loading caused by hitting a
&gt; sharp
&gt; bump in a sharp dip in the road and so on and so on... :)

	[Crick, Bill [KAN:0W40-M:EXCH]]  At which point you break the
windshield because the 
	old body is not as stiff as it used to be;-)
	Don't laugh, I did this on my 84 Tercel. Cost $350 for the new
windshield.
