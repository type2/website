Subject: Re: [T2] Adjusting flaps/thermostat when in a warm climate?

&gt;How should I set up the flaps when I tighten the screw for the
&gt;thermostat cable when the air temperature is around 70-80F? I imagine
&gt;that I don't want them fully closed as this will delay and even stop
&gt;them from opening fully. The normal temps this time of year during the
&gt;day are between 70-80, and 60 at night.

I lived three years in Italy with temps like you mentioned.

I adjusted the thermostat per Bentley and Muir and all was well all year 
whether I was I snow skiing in the Abruzzi mountains or visiting the beach 
in the heat of August.

VW engineer's designed into enough throw in the flaps to close in the cold 
and open fully when hot. If your flaps won't fully close or open then the 
thermostat may be going bad or a lever might be bent.

Good luck!
