&gt; I understand there's an initiative to drop a '62 23-window deluxe into
&gt; Lake Eeeeeeeeerie to rescue a group of endangered shellfish that can only
&gt; live in breadboxes. Any one else hear about this? ;) Joe

Hesh up, you mollusk. ;) Can't anybody eat those eerie bivalves? They 
make a *lot* of money harvesting mussels out of the Tennessee River. It 
appears to me like those varmints need some predators.

(Of course *I* would never eat anything that came out of Lake Eerie, but 
it ain't no telling what some folks will do.)

(No VW. NONE. I'm done. I really mean it this time.) ;)
