Subject: Re: [T2] Falling dollar and bus parts

&gt; Looking for the silver lining in the cloud, this
&gt; development should cause prices for buses in poor
&gt; to fair condition to drop. It will also 
&gt; send a lot of them to the boneyards.

Or put them on export to Europe :-D
But then they would have to be in rust free shape.
The export is already going on for a few years now.
Perhaps you know these guys:

Their prices are in English-pounds. I think they ask a
very high price but they sell...


yours,

Vincent
