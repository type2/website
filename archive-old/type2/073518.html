Subject: Jack stand safety

Chris and Loryn contacted me via the AIRS list and asked if they 
could stop at my place and work on an oil leak to which I agreed.

San Diego has been having a heat wave and it almost cost us an injury 
while working on their '72. We had the van up on jack stands when the 
stands sunk into the hot macadam and the van rolled off of the 
stands. Fortunately none of us were underneath at the time and there 
were no injuries to people or damage to the van.

The jack stands would be stable on concrete or similar surface, but 
the knife edges of the base can obviously sink into a soft material. 
We put the stands on some 2 x 12 pieces of wood scrap and finished 
the job. The oil leak was coming from a push rod tube seal.

I am going to shop for new jack stands, and really pay attention to 
their safety features this time around. The stands I have now were 
bought in 1971 when I was not so experienced.

Chris and Loryn are now making their way up I-5 to their home in 
Canada. If you see a blue and white '72 van with British Columbia 
plates and surfboard strapped to the roof give them a wave.

Have a good day
