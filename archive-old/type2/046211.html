&lt;&lt;personally I would probably take the I-78/I-81/I-70/I-68/I-70 route
(that detour over I-68 in the middle takes you around the PA turnpike and
a few very stiff grades)


good luck and have a great trip

Bob, 
Wow, thanks for the advice.  I'll take your suggested route.  I'll see how this old panel bus does on those hills.  Maybe stop and take a few pictures of it against the fall colors.

Steve
