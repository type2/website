Subject: Ignition LOCKed

I lately tried to move the currently dead husks of
'75 VW's (in preparation for winter snow removal in
our small town).  One had been idle 6 months, the
other 4 months.  I had expected the brakes to seize
(as described in previous ...);  however, the
ignition locks froze.  One came loose (lots of
silicone spray), but the other refused.  I got it
off the street, but it took some rough handling to
get it pointed in the right direction with the
steering column locked.

Any suggestions for freeing an ignition lock?
