Steve Asked:

&quot;Anyone got a better offer or a better idea?. . . .   but I'd rather find a
high-quality one-piece replacement muffler for '76-78.&quot;


(1) I can show you a BRAND NEW, still in box S&amp;S Header muffler, similar to 
the Pacesetter muffler we have all come to know and love.  I talked the lady 
at S&amp;S Headers into giving me a club discount.  You should be able to get a 
senior citizen discount ! !  !  I still have the receipt .

(2)  I may still have that muffler that you sold to me those many years ago. 
  Rusty on the outside, but solid on the inside (where you can't see  !  !  
!)

(3)  J B Quik Weld will patch the EGR pig tail on the muffler to get you 
through the week.  I am using J B Quik Weld on my after burner pipes until I 
can get the courage to again ask Karl to sell me his.  BTW, how is you heat 
shield.  Maybe Karl has one of those.

(4) I did see a 'local' shop that had a Pacesetter styled muffler hanging on 
the wall.  It was as solid and as heavy as an ANSA muffler, twice the weight 
of a Pacesetter / S&amp;S Headers muffler, and twice the cost!!!

(5) Ron, if you DO have an ANSA muffler way back in your store room, you 
might want to keep it for a museum piece, (or sell it to me for the price of 
a Pacesetter )

(6) You can buy Victor's machine and run that until you come to tgerms with 
your other 3 or 4 vehicles  ;-)
