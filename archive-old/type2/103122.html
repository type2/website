&gt; My bus is having problems with detonating. I'm running

Why are you doing this? You're getting pre-detonation so you're trying a
higher octane?

&gt; and I've screwed around with the timing
&gt; going anywhere from 4 degrees to 12.

Under ideal operating conditions, timing at idle it set about 4 degrees
after pre-detonation would occur. FYI.

&gt; I dont have a
&gt; tach so I dont know what my rpms are however I think
&gt; that its around 875 like VW recomends.

If you don't have the tuned ear of a seasoned mechanic, like myself, get a
dwell/tach automotive meter. Although setting the idle speed is the last
part of a tune-up is handy to watch the rpm change due to timing/vacuum.

&gt; there has been
&gt; some pinging happening and when I go up hills and
&gt; punch the accelerator it begins to ping and then
&gt; changes to a full rough noise and the engine suddenly
&gt; slows. I dont know if its all cylinders firing way
&gt; before top dead or some other problem. thanks for any
&gt; help,

From the sound of it you could be running way too lean. Excessive heat will
overcome octane. Back in September when you did your cross country trip, you
had a problem with high oil temps and high cylinder temps.

What did you do to resolve the problem then?  Did you:

- hook up a vacuum gauge to the air plenum and see what the reading was
despite being unable to locate any leaks at the time?

- have a mechanic check and reset the idle mixture with a gas analyzer?

You lost one head to heat already...
