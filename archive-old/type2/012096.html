I need help with a wiring question.  I went to start
up my 72 which I just finished installing a new used
motor in.  When I turn the key it just cranks and
cranks.  I checked to see if I was getting a spark and
I am not.  It appears as though the wire running back
from the ignition switch is not hot.  Next I checked
its corresponding fuse, and none were blown.  I'm
getting all of my lights and everything, but the wire
isn't giving any juice.  The last time I ran the bus
everything was fine in that department and the new
used motor I installed was running beautifully in its
old home.  Has anybody else had an experience with
this kinda thing.  Thanks

Kurt
