Subject: 72 Westfalia for sale

I am trying to thin the herd a bit (go from 4 to 3 buses).

I have a '72 Campmobile (Westfalia) that I am going to try to sell.  It 
runs and drives good and would make a good traveling companion.  It has 
a '79 Engine and transmission with a progressive two-barrel carb.  I 
have the fuel injection components from the '79 that I would let go 
with the '72 if someone is interested.  I am hoping to get around $2300 
for the bus but I will consider offers.

I can email pic's on request.

Pmail or call me for more info
