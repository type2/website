Subject: Automatic Things...

Whoa!  I was a bit overwhelmed with the responses to my Thing/Automatic 
tranny question but thanks to all who answered.  It makes sense that 
there weren't any automatic Things because of the offroad/manual tranny 
combo that just about any offroader has anyways.  I did, however, learn 
that Things did have a specific transmission and that is something I was 
not aware of.  What makes them &quot;specific&quot; though?  Ratios?  Case 
housing?  Are they stamped &quot;King Kubel Klassic&quot; or what is the deal?  
Thanks for the help with the trivia...

Slater!
