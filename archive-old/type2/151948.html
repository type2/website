&gt; &gt; When reassembling the CV-joints, shouldn't there be a clip around the outside
&gt; &gt; the smallest site of the boot to fix it on the axle? Can someone direct me to
&gt; &gt; this part?

&gt; The clips are part of the CV boot kit, but usually that are not used. The
&gt; boots never leak from that end of the boot, even without the clip.

I always use a wire tie (zip tie) on that end.
  easy to remove and holds well enough
