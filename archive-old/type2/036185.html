Gentlepersons-
                       On page 41 of the Pegasus Racing Catalog is an 
exploded view of the
Weber 32/36 DGV carb. &lt;&lt; www.pegasusautoracing_dot_com &gt;&gt;
                       This carb, and I believe, the 32/36 DFEV, were/are the 
common replacements for the FI systems on the Type ll engines. If this is 
your carb, Pegasus
has some, but not all replacement parts for it...as well as various main, 
air, and idle
jets. Armed with this info, and a small main frame computer to plot the 
characteristics (air flow, etc.), you should probably be able to tune your 
carb perfectly
to your particular engine...
