Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Progressive vacuum advance problem?

&gt;  From your description the most likely explanation is an obstruction in the 
&gt; passage through to the venturi. Unless your progressive is constructed 
&gt; differently to mine, there is no way to disassemble this area. You will 
&gt; need to blow, soak or poke out the obstruction. You need to consider that 
&gt; the hole is smaller at the venturi end so you may jam the obstruction in 
&gt; harder by blowing from the outside!

Does soaking with a solvent then trying to suck it out make sense?
(besides the obvious risks of either killing brain cells, or blowing
 up the vacuum cleaner).

Is there a cut away diagram anywhere that will let me see what I will
damage when I resort to poking needles into it?
