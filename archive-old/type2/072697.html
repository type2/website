&gt;Hey gang,
&gt;
&gt;I have a problem and would really like some of your sage wisdom:

This is the blind leading the blind, but I'll try.

As I said as I talked to you last week at the swap meet, I'm wondering if
it has something to do with the rubber hose and the sending unit being
mounted above your engine.  Could it be like when your light headed and
have to put your head between your knees.  Is it possible to mount the
sending unit so it doesn't drain out when the engine is off.

Also have you checked your oil pressure relief valve for any problems?


Have fun

&gt;After installing my shiny rebuilt 2.0 hydraulic lifter AVP engine in my 79
&gt;bus a couple months ago, I noticed that the oil pressure takes a really long
&gt;time to build up when I start it up.  On a cool day, it takes a good 30
&gt;seconds before the oil warning lite goes off and on a cold day, it takes
&gt;about 45 seconds.  During this 30 to 45 seconds, the engine makes a terrible
&gt;racket, but quiets down once the pressure comes up.  When the pressure
&gt;eventually comes up, it comes up really fast, like just a couple of seconds.
&gt;
&gt;I have just changed oil (Castrol 20-50) and a new German oil filter and the
&gt;problem persists.  Also, I have an oil pressure gage, so I know that the oil
&gt;warning lite is working right.
&gt;
&gt;I would really appreciate any advice you can throw my way,
&gt;
