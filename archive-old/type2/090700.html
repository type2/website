Subject: Re: [T2] Please answer this question now. This is an urgent matter.

 Last Year I bought a 72 411 auto in FT Collins
Colorado( About 70 miles from denver) and we towed ti
with the front wheels on a tow dolly( only because I
bought the car as a parts car and was told the tranny
was bad alreaddy). We Drove back to denver at about
70mph with the shaft disconnected. After a few weeks I
started tinkering to see if I could get the thing
started and I did, I tried to drive it around the
block and it actually made it. I drove that car as my
daily driver most of last summer. The shifting was a
little funky sometimes and it liked to stall in
reverse but I don't know if that is what the last guy
meant by the tranny being bad or because of the
towing. It was decent little car for a about $400
dollars total( including replaced fuel pump, 2 tires,
many FI componants, and battery)I traded it for a
motor for my 74 westy( mandatory bus content)
Later,
Tyler

&gt; If you're discussing automatic transmissions, the
&gt; rule is 25 mph Max, 25
&gt; Miles Max. Otherwise disconnect the drive shafts.
&gt; With standard trannys it can be as much as 100 mph
&gt; at 45 mph. You can tow
&gt; much much farther if you disconnect the drive
&gt; shafts.
