 Gillian:
 
 Very good suggestion.  Don't forget to label those wires when removing the
 engine or playing with the elctrical system.
 
 A video camera is also great for documenting what something looked like
 before being removed or disassembled. Don't try to rely on memory when
 working on a Bus.  
 
 Thank you!
