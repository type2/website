Subject: Free Bay Window Parts

I need to move all of these items at once.  If I don't get a taker I will
drop them off at my local VW dismantler who will will then charge us next
time we need these things.

Rear, middle, front seats for a bay window.

Entire side panel - driver middle section of bus for metal repair purpose.

oil bath air cleaners

door panels

and some other miscellaneous.

Located in Southern California.  The middle seat alone is worth a couple of
hundred dollars.  I would like someone to take all of it at once.  Let me
know.

- Mark
