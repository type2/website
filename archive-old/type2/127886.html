Subject: intake leaks?

i was told today by a guy who heard my van that i probably have an intake leak...he said such a thing is detrimental to an engine...he drives a bay as well so i assume he knows what he is talking about...anyone have any good methods for finding such a leak?
 
many thanks,
Colby
