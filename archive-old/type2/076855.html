Subject: Re: [T2] Z Products Z-Bed Conversion Kit

Tyler --

I'm curious -- where did the seat legs crack and what do you think caused
it? Are the legs tubes that come down, go back along the floor and rise up
again at the rear of the seat, as on a split-windshield bus?

The kit shown on The Bus Boys site is indeed the Z Products one. They're not
in stock, the &quot;Boys&quot; told me today. Maybe if they restock a few (hint) and
others keep signing up (ditto), we'll get a batch made! My thanks to those
who have already put themselves on Z Products' waiting list.

&gt; I think I saw a kit similar to this at the bus boys
&gt; website. http://www.busboys_dot_com I had one of these in
&gt; my 71 deluxe. It worked good except the legs on the
&gt; seats cracked. I went through two rear seats because
&gt; of this problem.
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Tyler
