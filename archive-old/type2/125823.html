Subject: Tow Bars

Bill,
       Where are you (geographically)??  I am located near Annapolis, MD, and 
would be willing to lend you my tow bar if that's a workable plan.  I made the 
tow bar some time ago... not elegant but does the job.  Started with a tow 
hitch made by Gibbes Machine in SC, found on a 60-ish type 2 in Chicago.  Glenn

REFERENCE:
I have to move some a 72 and a 73 camper. I don't have a trailer and my 
friends are probably getting tired of me borrowing their's all the time. 
Does anyone have the specifications on building a bus tow bar? Drawings? 
Pictures?  Thanks Bill
