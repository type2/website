Subject: '77/'78 Cylinder Head Question
In-Reply-To: &lt;199811150413.VAA28928_at_yiff.azaccess_dot_com&gt;
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.4.02A.9811151923210.2515-100000_at_insci14.ucsd_dot_edu&gt;

I need a new 3/4 cylinder head for my '77 California Type 2.  I've located
(and hidden) a candidate in a local junkyard, but wanted to be sure that
it would work before I bought it. There is nothing visiably (to me) wrong
with it.  It costs $30-$40.  Several questions:


1) what shoud I look for in terms of defects?

2) are the right and left sides different?  Is there a sensor on one side,
and if there is, on which side is it?

3) it seems to come from a '78 van.   Didn't they have hydrolic valves,
and does that effect the head.

4) assuming that WD-40 sprayed into the intakes doesn't leak past the
valves when closed, can I assume that the valve seats are in usable shape.

5) if it turned out that the valve guides need replacing, is that work
that a local machine shop could do (I know a local shop that specializes
in head work)?

6) any other advice about buying a used cylinder head?

Thanks!
