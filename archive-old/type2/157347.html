Subject: Re: [T2] Craftsman tools

Nah, I think tools just get heavier as they age.  That's gotta be  it.  I actually like this box because you can take one look at it  and see exactly what's missing.  I've got a smaller Chinese set  like that and after every job I make sure they're all back in  place.  Haven't lost one since.  So this is just a big step  up for me.  Cheers...KR


hmmmm, I've had a big tool box with all those drawers etc, and lately it
seems to keep getting heavier every time I lift it, so I wandered by Home
Depot and bought a couple of the $5-9 Stanley tool boxes and split my
tools up into sockets ,  wrenches,  etc  each getting their own litte box

can't be getting old, must just be getting more tools........ yeah that's
it, more toools!!!!
