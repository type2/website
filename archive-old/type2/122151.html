Subject: [T2] Starting a road trip, need advice

I'll tell you some words of wisdom.  Laptops are greaaaaaat.  They have 
their own battery which allows you to run them whenever and whereever and 
you can use the battery/isolator combo to recharge them.

But!

Don't fret if you can't.  You can get a power inverter from any place 
nowadays.. in Canada, Canadian Tire has them for less than is imaginable (I 
am the buyer at a computer chain/store) and they are decent too.  Get a 700w 
rated isolator.. check the package to compare what you will run to output 
levels.. Preferably one that connects direct to your battery source. Hooking 
into your lighter socket is a bit sketchy and Im guessing isn't easy on the 
wiring if you want to power a lot of stuff. In my van last summer I powered 
a laptop, puter with 15&quot; lcd screen, and Xbox (hooked into the screen) with 
no issues at all.

Don't bother with a UPS, you won't have issues with brownouts that would 
kill your system. Simply get a decent powerbar with spike protection to 
handle that. Smaller is better on the road when you want to save space.

My van was party central while travelling on road and parked :)
Im not familiar with dialup access down there so I can't help you but put a 
wireless ethernet card in your system because you will be amazed at how many 
places you can be and recieve a signal from unprotected network systems. 
Park next to a coffee shop, office building and you have free net.

Fun stuff.
Too bad I didn't know as much regarding tearing my motor apart. But that's 
next!

&gt;&gt;Here's one question, I need a computer and don't have a decent laptop. 
&gt;&gt;Could
&gt;&gt;I run a desktop off a inverter or is that just completely nuts. I would 
&gt;&gt;have
&gt;&gt;to get an LCD monitor which is fairly low power. If I had anything of 
&gt;&gt;a......
