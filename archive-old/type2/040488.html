ron, I have nt heard back from you over the last 6 months. I ? your gas
tanks for my 82 vanagon. I've been in need of one 4 some time now. I ? if
your gas tanks were the cheap ones or OE and have not heard back from you.
You must be having email problems... I also ? your recent post about the
starters.

Has anyone purchased a v'gon gas tank frm Ron? Please p-mail as I am nt on
the v'gon list. TIA
