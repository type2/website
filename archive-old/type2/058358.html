	Part of the reason I have been on this list, and bought the bus, was the
instant community of friends and support. Ever since my wife got her first bus
back in 89, I have always stopped to see if there was any thing I could do to
be of help when I saw a bus that looked like it was broke. No matter where you
are parked, if there are any other busses in the lot, they will find you and
say Hi. I used to stop for any one in an old car that looked like they need
help, I will do more of that in the future. No matter how busy, or how late
for something, there should always be time to help someone. 
	It sounds to me like some people went way above and beyond the call for you,
and that gives me encouragement. Of course you don't live in NJ ( I'll get
called on that one! ) In the paper over last week end, some guy got run off
the road by a new driver, who left the scene, and the laid under his crushed
motorcycle until the next day. No one stopped to see who was screaming all
night.
	As young hot rodders in the 60's, trying to change an image for the better,
we used to always stop and help stranded motorists, and give them a little
card with our car club logo on it. Can we still do this kind of stuff? Maybe
we should give it some thought........................................Johnny
