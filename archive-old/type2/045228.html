&gt;A bus listed as &quot;Westfalia '77&quot; [20-SF-56] has the early bay window bus
&gt;front-hinged poptop.  I can't tell from the photo if this camper has
&gt;jalousie side windows.  Was this bus retro-fitted with an
&gt;early bay window Westfalia poptop, or was the front vs. rear hinged poptop
&gt;available at the purchaser's specification when the vehicle was ordered
new?

I believe this is a retrofit. Over here many vans were converted to campers
after their useful life as a work-horse for a company was over. They could
have used parts of an older vehicle.

&gt;A bus listed as &quot;Westfalia '77&quot; [GJA-622] has some sort of
&gt;fiberglass(?) enclosure on the front bumper.  It even appears to have a VW
&gt;logo molded in.

I know that bus. It's owned by our Dutch Westfalia Register's
contact-person. He lives in Belgium just across the border. His license
plate is Belgian. We call these people economic refugee's (:-) because they
evade the high Dutch taxes! But the bus is original Westfalia and the cover
is indeed fiberglass. This is an add-on I believe was required in Germany
because over there it's not allowed to have anything sticking out more than
x centimeters in front of the bumper. So the bumper gets moved forward too.
I've seen more of them. It does indeed house the spare.

&gt;I'm sorry to be so inquisitive, but in 22 years of driving and
&gt;working on bay window campers I've never encountered these 2 arrangements.

No problem, glad to have some distraction. I'm having a bad day. This
weekend the radio was stolen out of my '81 Vanagon (I now have two
dysfunctional door locks but no other damage) and my Eurovan (that I bought
3 weeks ago!) was stolen last night. Since my son took the Vanagon for a 3
week holiday starting yesterday I now only have the '69 Clipper and my bike
for transportation. The '77 is in major repair (well, that way it's hard to
steal it). But I'm afraid to let the Clipper sit in the parking lot
overnight and my storage is 4 miles away. By now I'm quite sure my bike will
get stolen tomorrow!
