&gt;I just installed a new EGR filter and notice a sigificant change in idle when

Trying to

&gt;From my experience with EGR on other cars, it should not be active at idle.
 In other words it should not change the idle when disconnected vs.
connected.  It should only work during part throttle acceleration.  I would
guess that the valve is sticking, or that you have it hooked up to the
wrong kind of vacuum port.
