&gt; Garage?  What's that?  All my work takes place outside in my suburban
&gt; driveway.  I make sure to do as much as I can during the good weather months

you have a driveway????

&gt; but since our bus is a daily driver maintenance has to go on 12 months a
&gt; year.  Nothing like having to drop an engine after shoveling a foot of snow

BTDT, no fun, although prefer that to 95F and 95% humidity, like today
my 78 is a daily driver too.

&gt; out of the driveway.  Now there's something I won't soon forget.  So if you
&gt; have a garage, even if the bus barely fits, consider yourself lucky!

I have the little pad behind the garage, and it is on a public alley, in
the downtown of a major Eastern city..............garage is full of VW
parts, can't even go to the bathroom without getting a &quot;guard&quot; or putting
everything away and locking the garage door.  Oh can't leave it up on
jacks or anything overnight either,  hazard to the local kids.  power is a
long extension cord, or for bigger stuff like welding or air compressor,
fire up the generator.
