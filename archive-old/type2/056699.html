Subject: Re: parking lights on?

Hi Michael,
  This same thing happened to me when I went and bought a new
switch for my bus.  It was made so cheaply, that when you pushed
it all the way in (to turn off all lights) the little metal rod
connected to the knob, went too far past the back of the switch.
(there is a little hole on the back and the rod is not supposed
to pass through it).
This would cause my parking lights to remain on.  So I would have
to reach up under and lightly press on the back of the switch to 
push the rod back even with the back of the switch.  I planned
on replacing it, but eventually it started working correctly.

Good luck,
Wayne Carlisle

&gt; I noticed this morning that my parking lights were on even though
&gt; the headlight switch was off. Anyone been through this before?
&gt; Bad switch? Trouble in Tangled Wire City under the dash..?
