As im reassembling my cv joints much to my dismay, I noticed one side of the 
cv has a groove and the othe side has no groove . Does it really matter does 
the groove side go against the tranny and the other against the boot or versa 
a visa, I hope it does not matter cause I got em backwards if there is such a 
thing.
