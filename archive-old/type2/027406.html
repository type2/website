Hey, people!!

Just for instance, not like I would really do this, but just for instance . 
. .

What if I THOUGHT I ordered KYB gas adjust shocks for the front, and 
actually got the shocks for the rear.

And, just for the fun of it, what if I (b#tch#ng that these new KYB gas 
adjust shocks were SMALLER at the mounts than my old shocks, had to shim it 
out to fit) put these REAR shocks on the FRONT.

What do you think would happen??

Just for instance, not that I would REALLY be dumb enough to do something 
like that...

rumble trip in the road...
