My guess is that brake fluid is getting into your intake through the vacuum
line that is connected to your booster.  I bet it happens when your bus is
going uphill or accelerating hard (well, *relatively* hard :-).  This is
caused by a seal going out in the master cylinder and the booster filling
up with brake fluid - it's very common in older vehicles.
