Subject: My mouse story and a nest.

I have to add a story.

A few years ago we were camping in Mobilia in the Big Bear mountains 
of California. Early the next morning we were on a narrow and winding 
highway when a field mouse starts running back and forth across the 
front floor.

I don't know who was more surprised, the mouse or us. It was like the 
mouse was running to and fro over the tops of our feet screaming &quot;Oh 
my God! Oh my God! We were laughing hysterically which probably 
didn't help the mouse's agitation with the predicament.

Feather was driving and she didn't want step on the mouse, and lose 
control, as she tried to pull over into a turn out. It was tricky, 
the road was very winding and there was steep drop off to the right 
(and no guard rails). We got over without driving down the cliff and 
took a moment to figure our next step.

The mouse finally figured out that the was gap between the seat 
pedestals and headed aft disappearing under the Z bed. When we got 
home I set a catch-em-alive trap and in two days we had the mouse 
alive, we released him in a local canyon.

I am not sure how the mouse got in the van, the doors are hard enough 
to open for people. It might have climbed up a blanket that was 
hanging out for a while.

One of those memorable experiences that you cherish.

When I got the van there was precious little heat coming out the 
vents. I took off the tube underneath the van and found a number of 
toys, pencils, and gunk as well as good size mouse nest. Check that 
tube, after cleaning I got a lot of improved heating.
