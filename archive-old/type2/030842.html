Steve,
My name is Chris Grant, I'm an old but not-so-vocal member of the list. I have temporarily lost personal internet access and am writing you from work for help.
There is a soldier in my Army Reserve unit who owns a carbeurated '77 in desperate need of a rebuild. On cursary exam the seals are blowing oil, tin is missing, heat exchangers missing, and I believe a valve is burned in number 3.
Her name is Heather and she is sincere in her love for this Bus and would not trade it for the world. She has financial problems but has money for parts. What she needs is technical support, a loan of tools, and a place to work. That's a lot, I know. She lives in Salem, Mass so if there is anyone on the list who can lend a hand or two please contact me at:  cgrant_at_crhc_dot_org
Any help appreciated.
Thanks a bunch,

Chris
'76 Camper
