Subject: Re: [T2] What would you do? UPDATE

Ok.  After making sure the fuel pump was doing something, draining the 
gas tank and adding fresh gas, replacing the fuel filter, and repairing 
the S boot, I got it to run briefly at high idle before it would die.  
Then I checked the brake booster line (which I should have done first!) 
and saw a tube going nowhere.  I clamped it shut with a pair of vice 
grips and it ran at much lower idle for much much longer before dying.  
So, I'm thinking that this is my problem.  But I'm wondering where the 
hell this tube is supposed to go?!?  I couldn't find a place to stick it 
anywhere.   I took a pic of it and it's posted here...

Note:  I have a 77 with charcoal filter thing.  I tried looking at the 
pic on Ratwell site, but since i have the charcoal filter I could not 
figure out how to hook mine up...
