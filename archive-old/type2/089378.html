Subject: Re: [T2] am I leaking?


From: &quot;KYLE LAFERRIERE&quot;

My question is simple, I hope.
How do I turn the stove on in my 79?
I turned the knurled knob outside the car on the propane tank and heard the
hissing sound.
I then turned on one of the burners in the car and heard the hissing sound for
a second and then I could only hear it outside.  Then when I turned the
propane off from inside and outside I continued to hear and smell the propane
for a minute before it finally shut off.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I am a little confused when you say 'you turn the knurled knob' on the tank.
The only 'knurled knob' I know of on the tank is the bleed fitting for when
you fill it.
The correct knob to turn is the one that looks like a hose bib handle to the
left of the regulator. It is between the fill cap and regulator.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I looked in the archives but didn't find what I was looking for.
Am I leaking, or just doing something wrong?
Also, is anyone in CA having a problem getting their tank filled because of
the &quot;improper&quot; valve?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
That regulation ONLY affects portable barbeque tanks. Go here and print this:

If someone is giving you a hard time then have them READ the 1st sentence
where it says VERTICAL and NON-STATIONARY. Your tank on your bus is HORIZONTAL
and permanently mounted. It is NOT a portable tank.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Thanks in advance,
