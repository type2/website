Subject: Re: [T2] Now..the front suspension

[...]

&gt; The early bay beam ('68-'69?) is a different mounting bolt pattern than the
&gt; later bay beam...right? The later beams have disc brakes (smaller ones on
&gt; '70-'71? then bigger latter). And I guess the later ones came with power
&gt; assist brakes as well.

In the USA, 70 was still drum brakes. 72 and 72 had small calipers that used
thin pads. 73 to 79 had wider calipers that used thick pads [lasted longer]. The
outside dimension of the pads are the same.
