Hi,

You are essentially correct in your interpretation. However, 1973 
Westies were not made from sunroof Kombies. The 73 subsequently(I am 
told) has a inch or two more headroom because there is no 
accommodation made for the sunroof pocket. As long as we are steeping 
ourselves in minutia, we had a thread going a few weeks ago about the 
fact the 1972 model year sunroof kombies , Westies in this case, lack 
belly pans at least Canadian spec models do. I forgot to go and check 
out the US spec 72 Westies at EB and check.

Does the guy with late 70s sunroof bus have support pans on the frame 
rails under the cargo section?

&gt;
&gt;What ncbus really meant to say (ncbus correct me if I'm wrong) is
&gt;that the 68-73 westies were built from sunroof buses, but that the
&gt;74-79 westies were NOT built from a sunroof bus, but were built from
&gt;buses engineered with a roof designed to work with the new style
&gt;poptop.
