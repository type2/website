&gt;  Retrofitting the BA6 will be a little tricky since
&gt; the baywindow (AFAIK) never came with the BA6.

My 78 ASI/Riviera has a factory installed BA6 as well.
 In my travels, I have found many 78 and 79 era Bays
fitted with BA6 heaters.  BA6 heaters were factory
installed into late seventies type twos.
