&gt; I know you guys probably know about this, just in case the westy 
&gt;catalog on page 36 has mud flaps. White on black. 

&gt;Where does one find a &quot;westy catalog&quot;?

I think he means www.gowesty_dot_com. Page 36 of their 2002 catalog had VW dealer mudflaps but they haven't had them for a long time and aren't listed on the website anymore. They are working on their own for 68-79 busses. They may have the front ones available in a months time. The rears, I don't know.
