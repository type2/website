Subject: Re: [T2] 009 distributor? Why not?

&gt; I've checked the archives on this (try typing in 009, NOTHING comes
&gt; up). They didn't answer my question. I've been on this list long
&gt; enough to HEAR that you shouldn't put them on a BUS because the power
&gt; curve (or something like that) is all wrong, but I have never seen
&gt; any tests and data on it. Can anyone point me in that direction?

Main reason for not using an 009 is that the advance curve comes in too
late for bus applications.  This causes a bog at low RPMS.

&gt; The reason I'm asking is because last night I was leafing through a
&gt; popular VW magazine and saw a 009 on a single cab pickup.

The last place to look for tech advice is the VW T&amp;A magazines.  They have
lots of pretty &quot;here's my bus and a lot of money, be back in a week&quot;
restorations, but know little about actually driving the beasts.  Their
advertisers sell 009s, so guess what they push in their articles.

&gt; I thought
&gt; to myself &quot;If someone were to spend all that time and money restoring
&gt; that pickup to perfect condition, why would they put that 009 on it?
&gt; It doesn't enhance the performance. Don't they know that?&quot;
&gt; Am I missing something here?

The pickup probably isn't driven further than from its trailer to where it
is shown.  How would the driver know how well it runs?
