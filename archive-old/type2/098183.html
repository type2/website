&gt; Today's marketplace as far as I can tell offers the following tires,

&gt; Bridgestone 603V Highway Rib 185 R 14  Load range D   1855/65 psi...$71 each.

I would not use these!  The RD-603, yes; the 603V, no.  &quot;Highway rib&quot;
tread designs are mostly used on trailers and are designed for straight
tracking.  They are not designed for braking, turning, or traction.  This
may not be true of this tire, but I would still not use them.

I looked thru your questions and don't have answers.  I tried to do a
rational analysis of tires back a bit and got horribly confused and gave
up.  there are just too many variables to do a reasonable job of analyzing
them.  Some (ride smoothness) are very subjective, some are improtant in
some places but not in others (M+S rating).  I don't know :-(
