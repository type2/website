Subject: Re: vacuum dizzy

Eric
Thank you for your response and recommendation.  What is the serial # of your 
dizzy?
Sounds like you got the dual vacuum advance dist.  This is the single vacuum 
advance dist. (the only vacuum access is out of the &quot;can&quot;). My question is 
whether to connect the vacuum line to the manifold or above the manifold 
(different vacuum characteristics)
I think the vacuum should be connected to the lower manifold...but not sure...
Thanks Again
