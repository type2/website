&gt;What's the deal with the &quot;third&quot; fresh air hose that takes hot air from the

*************************************************

The purpose of the carb pre-heat is to to insure that the warmest possible
air is available when the engine is stone cold, especially in cooler/cold
climate areas.  It also helps the often plugged up heat riser on the
manifold prevent carb icing, which can cause hesitation (or stumbling) on
those cold mornings.  That little snout is called a &quot;stove pipe&quot; which
helps conduct that warm air from the cylinders.

If you live in the desert southwest where it is warm/hot most of the year,
you probably would not miss it by sealing off the hole.  But if you live in
the higher elevations or in a cooler/cold climate where the mornings are
often chilly, then you may want to let the engine warm up a few minutes
longer before driving off.

Bonus Answer:  All carb pre-heats are thermostatically controlled, but
depending on the year in different ways.  68-70 models had their pre-heat
flaps in the air cleaner controlled by a cable connected to the
Thermostatic Flap Assembly on the Fan Shroud.  1971 models had a
Thermostatic Spring/Ring on the Air Cleaner itself, but is useable on 68-70
models if the cable assembly (which is NLA from VW) is missing.

Personally, I would reinstall the Stove Pipe and run it the way it was
designed originally.  It can be reattached with the engine installed.  Just
remove one of the exhaust flange nuts, slip it over the stud and reattach
the nut.  It's easier to do if the Rear Apron (UK people call these a
&quot;valance&quot;) and the large Rear Pulley Tin are both removed.
