Subject: FI fuel line - btween filter and pump
Message-ID: &lt;38112E45.684E_at_attglobal_dot_net&gt;

Hey all,
I've followed the recent fuel line thread and searched the archives to
little avail.

I'm looking for the fuel line from the filter to the pump on a FI '76
westy.

It's larger than the rest of the lines.
what's the ID/OD?
Where can I get the line - regular flaps?
Since it is not in the pressurized loop. does it need to be FI specific?

And also, the filler neck - was there a message on where to purchase
this?  I remeber previous threads where people incorrectly used radiator
hose and were quickly corrected by the list.  Is there an aftermarket
part or just get large fuel line from a truck/diesel store??

thanks
michael
