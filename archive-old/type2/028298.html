Subject: Painted Hubcaps $24.95/set of 4

Importance: Normal

I just obtained some painted VW hubcaps, which are stock on cargo vans in
Europe.  These are genuine Volkswagen, and are _much_ heavier duty than the
aftermarket Mexican/Brazilian ones available today (which rust out very
quickly). They are just like the small chrome hubcaps used here on '71-82
busses and vans, except that they are painted black rather than chromed.
They cover the center area of the wheel (but not the lug nuts), and fit
'71-91.

Price is $24.95 for the set of 4 (plus shipping).  Part number 251 601
151B4.  They'll be on the website tomorrow, or you can order toll-free at
1-888-819-DEPOT.  Only ten sets available.  No further discounts apply.
