Subject: UPDATE: NJ inspection woes

I maile the list a couple weeks ago about my difficulty inspecting my '77 
Westy in NJ.  Thanks much for all the suggestions, offers, etc.  After the 
initial phone call when the garage made it sound nearly hopeless without 
properly fixing the body rust and replacing the seats, I went and chatted 
with him and we worked out a plan and she is now inspected until Jan. 2004.  
I'll post pictures of the &quot;new and improved&quot; look soon, but here is how she 
looked last summer. Both doglegs have rust holes, rockers are pretty beat 
up, and on both sides behind the rockers is a good size rust hole.  
Incidentally, a couple of you appropriately asked about the integrity of my 
front beam.  I've checked it out in the past (I just put new shocks, sway 
bar &amp; steering dampner on this summer so had lots of time to look around 
down there :), but can't say I know exactly what I'm looking for.  If I post 
some pictures to a website maybe some of y'all can tell me if it looks bad?

Like some of you suggested, my solution was to buy some metal body tape and 
new seat covers.  The tape looks silly (like I'm trying to chrome the lower 
6&quot; of my van) and the only seat covers I could find to fit were $60/pair but 
they worked.  I also had to remove the aux. driving lights from the front 
bumper (that haven't worked since I bought the van) since they too were 
illegal (!?).

Surprisingly, with a little tweaking, the emissions were quite low despite 
the Weber progressive/009 conversion from the PO.

I kind of miss the looks from people in my wealthy 'burb when they saw the 
Missouri plates, &quot;You drove *that thing* all the way from Missouri??&quot;  
&quot;Several times in fact, though I like it so much here in your little town 
I'm staying!&quot;

Happy bussing

Patrick
'77 Westy
Madison, NJ
