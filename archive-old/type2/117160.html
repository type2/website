Subject: Re: [T2] point gap - who is right???

I noticed that on my petronix it is almost 40 but the bus seems quite
peppy, especially for an automatic.  maybe getting it up to 50 will help
even more.  Would changing the gap change the dwell a bit with the
petronix?

George,

Yep, on Points, dwell never lies and I generally get great
performance and mileage when running stock points....however...back to the
pertronix argument that the dwell on an electronic unit doesn't make
much difference.

Mine runs about 44 degrees, and I don't like it there....seems like the
bus is a little slugish....and *no* amount of adjusting anything will
change it.

My mental processes area little slow this morning as I am still on
German time from my trip(more on that later...with pics!)....so, if I have
forgotten where that discussion on dewll and electronic points went, pleas
forgive me.

Cheers, dave
