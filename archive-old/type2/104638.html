Subject: Westy Weight

Just had a simple quick question and couldn't find it on any of the bus sites.

What's the aprox weight of a 78 Westy?

I'm looking to replace my current car with something that'll have a tow rate 
enough to tow the bus incase it's ever stranded.

Thanks!

Andy
'78 Rusty Green Westy
