Subject: what engine

We have a 1971 bus that needs a new engine, we want to buy a long block but 
who is a good builder. Has anyone had any experience with putiing in a larger 
pumped up engine. California Imoprts has some engines by SIR international 
ranging from 1641cc to 2110, now the 2110 is to much money but something 
inbetween would do. any ideas thanks
