&gt; Hi Guys
&gt;
&gt; This is another day, since you must remember the treads of the number 3
and 4 cylinder head are torn, next step drop the engine and take the head
out. Well I was reading the Tom Wilson book and he advice to hold the
tranny with another jack before drop the engine. Although mine is a 77
Westy she looks like 71 (exported to Venezuela) with just one upper nut
in the right inner side of the engine and a bolt in the left side) and
the tranny is supported by some bolts to a cross member in the chassis,
my question is I still to hold the tranny anyway ?
&gt;

If the rear end of the transmission is supported by the body you don't
need to support it.  It will be very obvious if it needs support!
