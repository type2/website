We are new to the list, but our '79 Westfalia covers most of the Southwest
between Phoenix, San Diego, LA, San Bernardino and on up the Owens Valley to
Bishop and Lee Vining (for Trout Fishing and Backpacking).  It is on the
road monthly.  If a sign-up list starts somewhere, we would be willing to
fill in any gaps in the southwest.
