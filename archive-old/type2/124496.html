Subject: Re: [T2] Can't get it to run right cont'd

The hole was perfect, I guess it may have come that way but it sure was
giving weird dwell readings!  There were major vacuum leaks where the intake
manifold meets the heads, I'll continue to look for more.

&gt; I have seen replacement points with the hole. Was the hole &quot;perfect&quot; or
did it have jagged edges?
&gt;
&gt; Look for vacuum leaks because EVERY VW engine I have tuned had vaccum
leaks.
