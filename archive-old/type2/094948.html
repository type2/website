Subject: Re: [T2] Help with crankshaft endplay (it's WAY out)

&gt;More shims won't fix this problem.
&gt;You should be concerned with the #1 main
&gt;dowel pin hole. It was not designed
&gt;to accomodate your intended solution.

Another listmember suggested in a p-mail that the flywheel can be machined, 
taking a few thou off the surface where the dowel pins mate to reduce the 
endplay. Anyone have experience with this? Worth trying? He also seemed to 
think I should just throw an extra shim or two between the crank and #1, 
since the engine sees so little mileage (&lt;1,000 a year) and that by doing 
this, I could stop the front seal leak and maybe wring a few more years out 
of the engine (at the expense of the case, I'm sure).

Any opinions?

Thanks,
