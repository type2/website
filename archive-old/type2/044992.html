Rob/list
I regret not being able to make it.  It is 500+ miles away for me, the bus's
long trip potential is questionable right now and i'm working through the
whole weekend anyway. Planning, i know- but just having the bus is a luxury
right now.
BBTA 98 saw me crazy-haired and drinking wearing a black 'Maynard Ferguson'
tour shirt. Any u guys remember me? little bitty dude (bout 125 lbs, 5'6&quot;)-
kinda drunk -no bus - just hanging around.. Charlie -i talked to u that night
i know...
I did the trip on a whim in my old T_at_yota 4wd tercel - i was to meet Ted
Finesman in Louisville and hand off a part to trade to Steve Lashley, but i
got pulled over and thought i missed him so i figured the hell with it -and
just made the trip myself!  I ended up beating Ted by an hour or so. 
Turns out he waited longer than he said he would - kind hearted fellow. A full
weber kit for the rear upper storage comprtment from a 78 westy seemed like a
great trade to me, and i wanted to be there.

Thanks to Ted that year for letting me pass out in his tent and for the best
coffee i have ever had the next morning. 

still into it,

clark gordon
Morehead, ky.
