David,

How is your transmission coming along?

Dana and I are REALLY looking forward to the Everybus, and hopefully seeing
you and everyone else.

I am curious, though, about the future of the hubcap. I would like to take
it, back to Asheville, and then maybe towards the general direction of
Yankeeland, but no further than the Mason-Dixon line. Alternatively, I have
a business trip planned to Canada, (Kitchener, Ontario) the first week in
May and I could drop it off along the way. But I fear that there may be a
*Debacle at Everybus* over the cap. I certianly do not want to be
memorialized in a flow chart, or really to give my life over any specific
cause.

However, I did notice that the person currently in possesion of the cap is
not specifically named. If the future of the cap has been predetermined, or
if it is currently under the administration of the Federal Witness
Protection Program, I understand.
