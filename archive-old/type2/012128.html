Subject: Re: [T2] south african buses...

Hi all

&gt;i've been seeing this video on worldlink tv by this s. african rasta that 
&gt;has a cool bus in it...it looks like it has a big evaporative cooler on the 
&gt;front, i guess to cool the passengers...the bus looks like a 68-70 with the 
&gt;wide five wheels....a spare tire stuck on the back hatch and a small pop 
&gt;top....just wondering if any one in s. af. knows how these coolers work...

I must say, I've never seen an evaporative cooler in real life. Are you
sure it wasn't just a radiator? That's a very popular mod around here,
a big fiberglass shell holding a radiator up front, and a Ford V6 in
the back...
