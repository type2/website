One more day till Friday...
any good advice on patching a small hole (about 1&quot;) on the heater box?  Is
there a specific material that should be used?  JB?  Is this a bad idea?
I've heard of exhaust being patched so I assume it's do-able.
thanks! -Chris 73 Westy'  
 Mine started out that way but eventually got so bad I had to replace the
box, which is no fun at all since all the bolts and nuts were corroded in
place from 25 years of exposure.  Most twisted off when tying to undo them.
Plan on drilling out the stubs, which requires a titanium coated drill bit,
since the bolts seem to be high grade stuff. Mine was a 78 so I had to drill
out broken studs in the crossover pipe, very carefully. Also a tip on
removal.  Although the Bentley says you have to remove muffler, crossover
pipe, left connecting joint, it is not necessary.  If you can get the U pipe
bolts off at the front, you can saw through the heater box outlet pipe to
get the box out and have some room to tackle the three bolts holding the
Heater box flange to the crossover flange.  Mine was a right side box
