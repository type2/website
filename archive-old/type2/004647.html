Hi all,

Just bought a '77 Transporter:  85K miles, runs well, smokes little, little
rust, few dents, good glass(enough to pass inspection), intact headliner,
dashboard, and interior vinyl (except for sliding door), good clutch, good
sychronizers in all gears, some kind soul even installed a Weber
progressive.  Just has your normal leaks (mostly pushrod tubes), trashed
heating system, aerosol can paint job, and very sloppy shifting.  All this
for $600.00!  From a used car dealer at that.  Talked him down mainly due to
the fact they could not figure out why nothing happened when you turned the
ignition switch. (heh, heh)  Also because this is not a VW market, and I was
patient enough to wait until he was willing to give it away.

This is my first bus, I promise not to ask too many stupid questions.

1.   I know from owning beetles that the shifter is supposed to be sloppy.
Nearly hits dash for 1st, hits emerg brake handle for 3rd, lots and lots of
play.  How do you tell whether to replace shifter or tighten at tranny?  I
have seen devices for beetles to tighten shifting, will they work for bus,
are they worth the trouble?  (I wouldn't even worry about it, but would like
for wife and son to be able to drive it)

2.  This is a stupid question:  are the parking lights supposed to come on
when the ignition switch is on?

3.  Are there any subscribers out there from the Tupelo, MS area?  I live
near Myrtle, looking for good places to buy used parts.

Thanks for this list and your time

                                                        Frank Stroupe
