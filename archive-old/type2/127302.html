&gt; My bus is a 1971 w/ 1776, mild cam, dual Kadrons and an SVDA

&gt; points. I swear that before I began tinkering with this engine I clocked 
&gt; 19mpg. At the moment I am in a deep funk about this. Gonna go over 
&gt; everything with a fine-toothed comb this weekend: valves, timing, look 
&gt; for carb leaks, AFM, and anything else I can get my little rodent paws on.

I think you are on the right track by checking everything, but if you
have one of the SVDA's from aircooled_dot_net I was told to time them
vacuum hooked up at 7.5 degrees BTDC, what instructions did you time
these to?

also you shouldn't have an AFM w/ carbs, this might be your problem
(hehe). BTW what do the plugs look like? do you think you might have
the kads setup way to rich?
