Subject: Re: &lt;Fri&gt;AMEN ADMIN!

&gt;We'll.  In keeping with my idea of praising the efforts of those who
&gt;have provided this list for our access by storytelling, here's mine:
&gt;
&gt;Of the MANY times the list has saved my bus, including saving it from
&gt;the scrapyard, here's one bus story that I hold especially dear.

[wiper wires fixed snip]

i owe the fact that i have my vehicle for life to the list. a year ago
today a listee dropped the classified2000_dot_com advert on the list. another
listee in the area 10 hours drive away from me sussed it out 30 minutes
away from him. he sent e-photos, put me up and fed me at his house,
introduced me to his friends, took me to work all day before the deal went
down, got the non-running garbage-laden beater rust bucket to idle, and
finally on a very steep muddy slope driveway along a dark wet dangerous
double curve stretch of u.s.101 and logger trucks, he helped me get the
doublecab onto a trailer, which in and of itself was a circus nightmare i
won't rehash. (only took out a mile marker - none of the 10 people involved
got seriously injured) and during that trailering time he had to meet a
special 'nam buddie he hadn't seen in years. but he put that off to make
sure i was on the trailer. then he took me with him to his scheduled
appointment near the guiness tap. shining listee/airs example. alas, this
knowledgable extremely caring and talented engine rebuilder, 'cause of the
silly feuding that goes on here infrequently enough sending these special
kinda folks &quot;back up to the hills&quot;, quit the list. ugly ending right?    -
