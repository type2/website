Hi,

&gt; Aftermarket sway-bars (add one in the back and replace front one with
a

&gt; '75 westy and I already had good reinforced tires. No more white
knuckle
&gt; rides, no fear of gusty side wind.

 I'll second this, but point out that there are quite a few
possibilities
with tyres. Car tyres, reinforced, load range C and load range D. My 
experience is that the thing that makes the biggest difference is the
stiffness and strength of the tyre sidewall and this seems to be pretty
closely related to the Load Index on the sidewall: the number that reads
&quot;99S&quot; or &quot;97T&quot; or whatever. This number is INTERNATIONAL, so doesn't
run into the mismatch between European and US &quot;standards&quot; that seem
to cause confusion.
 The bare minimum for a bus is that the number should be 95 (the letter
only matters for fast cars:&quot;R&quot; is 106mph, plenty, and virtually all
tyres available will rate at least this). &quot;95&quot; means the tyre can handle
690Kg (1521 lbs). As this number goes up the strength of the sidewall
increases and with it the resistance to flexing. 185R14 tyres are
made in various ratings: Michelin's van tyre range is the Agilus and
manufactured as:

 Agilus 61: 185R14C 99R		(775Kg/1709lbs)
 Agilus 81: 185R14C 102R	(850Kg/1874lbs)

Compare this to a car tyre from Semperit:

HiLife M601: 185R14 90S		(600Kg/1320lbs)

 Which is the same size but is unlikely to be safe.

 This information can be hard to get hold of, as it isn't an issue for
most car buyers. It's there on the sidewall, though, and should be in
the catalogues, too. Talk to your tyre dealer.
 95 is safe, 97 will improve handling and is what I'd recommend as a
basis. 99 plus will give you substantially stiffer tyres and hence less
body roll but if you go to 102 or 104 and also have heavy-duty shocks
you may find that the ride is getting a bit firm.

 Incidentally, I did a search for 185R14 tyres in a UK hosted tyre
database
and got 65 listings, including ones from Michelin, Goodyear, Dunlop,
Avon
Yokohama, Firestone, Uniroyal...

&gt; Your idea implies a change in wheel offset. We had a lengthy
discussion on
&gt; this topic a week or two ago. The quick summary is that too much
difference
&gt; from stock will cause undue stress to the bearings among other things.

 Yup. I'm with Sami here, too. You don't need to do this to get more 
stability, and there are better ways to do so.

Cheers,
	W.

PS In my view running &quot;car&quot; tyres on a bus is like running &quot;S&quot; rated
tyres on a Porsche, and potentially could get you into difficulties
if you had to make an insurance claim, as the assessor could
legitimately
claim that you hadn't conformed to manufacturers specs.
