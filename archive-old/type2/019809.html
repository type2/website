Tony,

I just received a circular from Sears today and guess what?
They have those Easy Outs on sale for $35.99 if your a Craftsman Club member or
$39.99 if your not a member.
By the way membership is free.
Think I'm gonna try a set myself.

Hope that helps.
Steve

Gentlepersons-
                       A friend returning from the UK brought back an
improved type of EZ Out.
They're self-centering - making their own pilot hole as they enter the broken
stud/bolt/
what have you. The site I have for them is
&lt;http://www.bardolph.co_dot_uk/search/supplier/aldencorp.htm&gt;
Luckily, I haven't had to try them on an exhaust stud yet...but I've tried
them on some
assorted pieces about the shop, here, and they seem to work quite well. Much
better
than the regular EZ Outs that I've tried. Anyone on the other side of the
pond familiar
with them...or know if they're available stateside?
