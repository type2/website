Hi to all!

I'm taking possession of a 1972 West (or is it the West taking 
possession of me???) tomorrow.

The trip back home is about 400 miles. I saw the vehicle only once 
and I did not have the opportunity to inspect the mechanical aspect 
save for a ride around the block (about 2 miles). 

The ride was good and the engine &quot;seemed&quot; fine. I did not have the 
time to verify more and I bought it right there. That was the 7nth 
West that I visited on this trip and the best of the batch.

My question is: what should I do (inspection, adjustement, 
driving, etc...) to make sure I have the least problems during the 
trip.

Any information will be appreciated...


Thank You all!!!
