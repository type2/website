&gt; I am finally doing something about the outer clack, clack,clack in my cv
&gt; joints, 71 van.
&gt; 
&gt; If i replace the whole half shaft complete with joints and boots from a
&gt; 69, does it matter if i hook up to inner or outer?
&gt; In other words, i cannot remember which side or tranny or wheel the
&gt; replacement shafts were located.

No it doesn't.  in fact, the &quot;twist&quot; direction is the same if you swap the
shaft end-for-end.  It only changes if you switch them left for right.
Some folks find that swapping left-for-right quiets noisy joints, but I
prefer to replace joints if I have the axle off.
