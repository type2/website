Subject: Rear windshield wiper?

Hi all-

I've just found this group, and am pleased to see an energetic and 
knowledgable group of people who will undoubtedly be able to help me 
avoid the pitfalls and errors that a newby &quot;Bay Window&quot; owner such as 
myself might create on his own.

That said, I have a 1979 Deluxe Campmobile in original Mexican Beige, 
with a just completely rebuilt 2.0 litre engine (I couldn't believe how 
much MORE expensive than rebuilding a dual-port 1600cc!), with a 2 bbl. 
progressive Weber/Holley (done by DPO) and 109K showing on the odometer.

There are a number of things the DPO did, such as replacing the water 
pump and sink faucet with a hand pump, disconnecting all of the heater 
cables, removing the levers from the dash, and putting the cables into a 
custom plexiglass &quot;mount&quot; below the dash with NOTHING marked!  The 
peeling dark window film on every single window makes my wrists hurt, 
just thinking about all of the scraping I have ahead of me!  Also, the 
rear window defroster wires in back have been cut, but I do have power 
to one of these, and it is still controlled from the switch in the dash.

I live in Deep East Texas, where it is excruciatingly HOT nine months 
out of the year, and cannot foresee a time when I would EVER need a rear 
window defroster.  So, it occurred to me that perhaps I could use this 
switch and wire to power a rear windshield WIPER, which would be far 
more useful.  Here's my question:  Did VW ever put a rear window wiper 
on the later Westies, and if so, is there any way to retrofit such a 
system on my 1979?  Has anyone ever &quot;home made&quot; his/her own rear 
windshield wiper system?

Thanks in advance for any info.
