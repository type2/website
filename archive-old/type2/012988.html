Subject: Exhaust/heating question 79 bus

	I finally got my first bus monday so this is my first venture into
the world of air-cooled. Normally I would just look this up in the
service manual since it seems quite simple but since it is still in
transit via ups I can't really look there. On my 79 between the heat
exchangers and the heating ductwork there is an exhaust valve. On mine
one end to the duct; one end to the exchanger and one end open to
atmosphere.
	So my question is what should be connected to the open end and what
should control the opening and closing of this valve (i.e. there is a
control cable connected to a lever, but nothing seems to move it from
the environ controls.
	Also, on the passenger side, under the cylinders there is a cable
idler pully, what should the wire on this be connected to? Mine is only
connected to that sky hook.
	Thanks in advance for not letting me go crazy speculating about the
nature of these questions while I await my service manual.
