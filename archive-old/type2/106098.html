Subject: Re: [T2] Friday Content: &quot;PSP&quot;

From: &quot;George Lyle&quot; &lt;glyle_at_pon.type2_dot_com&gt;
&gt; I appreciate your intent, but even friday posts have to have bus content!
Now if you made the medallion bus-shaped...  :)

My apologies, George.

You have no idea how much I'd like to do something like bus key fobs and
such!  I'm working on the horn button master, and tossed out an idea of a
bus series (each button portraying a different bus style) because of the
copyright issues.

I also spoke with Darrell Robertson yesterday (Robertson's Import Auto Parts
&amp; Service), and learned about some of the things that happened to other
businesses that ran afoul of the VW thing.  Yikes!
