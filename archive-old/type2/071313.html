Dear Volks,

We've had our 1968 double-cab a few months and have about 2 months on a
rebuilt engine.  I've been learning the mechanicals slowly, and this is beyond
me.  I have no idea what to look at in the archives, because this seem wierd.
It will be 3+ weeks before I can get into the only trustworthy VW mechanic in
our town, who's booked up further than any doctors, so I need some help.

Last night my son came in and said that whenever he used the clutch and brake
to stop at a light that was about the change, the engine would die.  If he
instead shifted into neutral and coasted to the light, the engine kept
running.  Other than this, it runs just fine.  I suspected a clutch problem,
but he says it shifts normally.  He says it does not sound like it's stalling,
it just dies quietly.  The first few times, he didn't even know it had died.

Any ideas?
