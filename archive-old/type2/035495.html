&gt; &gt; *Very* pretty bus -- fresh paint, gray industrial replacement carpet
&gt; &gt; kit, looks like front bucket seat upholstery has been re-done, camper
&gt; &gt; set-up looks good (gold vinyl) and complete, looks like a decent sound
&gt; &gt; setup with fader and 4 speakers. It's got Hawaiian print curtains
&gt; &gt; (unfaded), blue nose and cargo hatch emblems, 195R15 tires
