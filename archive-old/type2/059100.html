Subject: 1975 CAMPER HELP!!!
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hello, i just bought 75 camper this fine friday eve and was wondering if i
could get some help. first i need to know how hard it is to get a matress
for the poptop,it doesn't appear to be a westy as there is no slanting
poptop or westy tags. it has the straight up acordian style poptop. also how
much would a new windshield run me? i am 15 and money is a consideration.
any help is aprecciated and i should have more info to come. thank you.
