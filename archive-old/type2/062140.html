Subject: Miles per gallon 1977 bay windowed breadloaf

Volks,

My 'loafie has been getting only 15 - 24 MPG.  Just purchased this great 
bus and I was lead to believe by the PO that I should be getting around 
30.  This fuel injected 2 litre engine runs great and starts easy.  No 
smoke and just passed California smog.  Where do I start?

Thanks
