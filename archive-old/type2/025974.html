&gt; lacquer is back, officially available around me (MD, PA, WV) but I'm
&gt; pretty sure everywhere to hobbyists only.  Around here a bunch of
&gt; places illegally never quit selling it, but it is legally available for our
&gt; use again but not for commercial (shop) application.

That's good to know.

Is it just me, or is lacquer the highest-maintenance paint ever invented? To
me, Autocryl's worth its cost in cash and effort to apply because once it's
on, you don't have to devote your life to it.

Get well, Mary!
