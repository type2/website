Subject: RE: [T2] Dwell on this



&gt;For that same price, you can get the Crane CDI.  It comes with the optical 
&gt;trigger(replaces the points) and the CDI 'brain'.

I do not like optical triggers. This is NOT the way to go. They work, but 
look at your engine compartment, look at the dizzy. This is a dirty place, 
and optical sensors get fouled by dirt and grime. Heat also affects them to 
some degree. Avoid optical, and go with magnetic fields.
