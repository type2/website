Subject: 71-72 brakes to 73-79 upgrade?

hi all,

before posting this i searched the archives but came up with nothing that
answered my questions so here goes...

My 71 firewagen has been clunking and thumping in the front lately so it
is time to do the ball joints.  In addition i was thinking about upgrading
to 73-79 disc brakes since my rotors are shot, my calipers are
questionable, and ill have the whole thing apart anyhow....

I have all the parts in the laundry room but have been getting cold feet.

my main concern is that the new beefier discs may require that the brake
proportioning valve be adjusted.  I am always leery of deviating from
stock standards because quite often you end up opening a whole can of
worms that causes a small job to cascade into a large one.

So i guess what i am soliciting is experience with the pros or cons of
changing my brakes to 73-79 models.  If you have done it and love it, done
it and wish you didnt or have any other advice i would really appreciate
it.  I have to get this fixed this weekend as i am going out of town the
weekend after and wish to drive the bus.

also i have a spare set of arms for the front, so i can get balljoints
pressed in without dissasembling my bus (daily driver and all)  One of the
arms has suface rust on the bearing surface where it will ride in teh
beam tube. No pitting but some minor degradation of surface smoothness.
Will this be a problem, i/e is it unusable?

thanks,

Steve

p.s. i am in digest so if you reply to the list i would love to get a cc
as well :)
