Heya Justin,
I drive a 71 also...so maybe I can give some pointers.  My bus did this a lot
too...especially when it was cold outside.  I drove with the heel-toe method for
quite some time.  I would change the fuel filter...and for some reason...that
seemed to help?
I recently changed my carb and now it doesn't die any more upon braking... I'm
not sure why...but my old carb would suck in a little air where the idle cutoff
switch screwed in....someone messed up my threads on that...and the switch
didn't like to stay in the carb that well...
Also... 71 has power disc brakes.  Check your vacuum line for leaks...also check
the one way check valve....thats usually the problem.  Also check for any intake
leaks...and check out your fuel filter.  Even if it doesn't look bad...change
it... mine never really looked bad....and yet it helped.  Maybe it is a failing
fuel pump??  I'm not sure...

hope this helps

&gt; When I am driving my 71 cold and I push in the clutch to come to a stop, the
&gt; motor will die.  If I am coming to a stop and I push in the clutch and then
&gt; blip the gas, it will not die.  Is there something wrong with my idle
&gt; circuit or what?  I could not find any useful information in the archives.
