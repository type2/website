Subject: Subaru --&gt; Type II ...Part 3 of 4 

Part 3: Cooling system and side hinged decklid fabrication. 

Needed:

1.)     ***Radiator out of Subaru, or a taller, wider, but not thicker one.
$50-75 w/fans
2.)     (3) VW bus decklid hinges in good condition.
3.)     Welder
4.)     (2) 21&quot; full flex radiator hoses, 1-1/4 dia.
5.)    3/4&quot; long cabinet lock or equivalent latch assembly.  The locks are
nice because they serve as a    decklid latch and if you get (2), you can
throw a matched one on your gas door.

&gt;From the steel supply store:

5.)     1&quot; Sq. box tubing with 1/16 wall, about 12 feet. $8
6.)     A strip of 1/8 x 1-1/2 flat steel bar $8.  This will be to make all
the bracketry such as latch mount       striker plate, and radiator attach brackets.
7.)     (4)16 gage sheet metal strips.  They will sheer them for you. (2)
pieces _at_ 40&quot; long  x 1-1/2&quot; wide,       (2) pieces 23&quot; long x 1-1/2&quot; wide.  $10
8.)     Enough body sheet metal to cover  the entire area of decklid and
rear apron.
9.)     About 6 feet of 1-1/4 round steel tubing with 1/16 wall.

10.)     (3) pieces of 1/4 or 3/8 steel, 2&quot; long x 3/4 wide.  (hinge
mounts)big enough to make lugs
11.)     A strip of 3/5 x 1/8 flat steel bar about 11 inches long.  You may
as well get a long piece...the price    for a 12 foot piece at the steel
supply will be the same as a 2&quot; piece at the hardware store. $6

Note:  This phase requires a lot of fabrication and welding.  It will also
take a while.  (It took me about 10 hours over 2 weeks time)

*** My 64 Double has a '82 Subaru radiator.  There is room to go 4&quot; taller
and 3&quot; wider.  This doesn't sound like much but that is a lot more cooling
capacity.  The stock radiator is cooling the stock 1600 cc engine fine but I
will be upgrading when I add the 1800cc Turbo.  If you don't have a
radiator, build the decklid frame first, then find the biggest radiator that
will fit on the frame.

Study the existing VW bus decklid.  Notice how the hinges mount to a flat
surface on the bus, and to an angled' surface on the deck lid.  You are
going to mount (3) of these on the right side of the door opening.  (The
only 'cutting ' of your vehicle will be the 6 attach holes that you drill
for the hinges.)  Remove the rear apron.  Notice how the opening is straight
until it gets to the bottom, then it curves in toward the front.  Your new
decklid will be made to follow this contour.  It will fit the entire area of
existing decklid and rear apron. The assembly you will make is as follows:

1.)  A box tubing 'frame' that fits inside the opening and has hinges on the
right and latch and bullet pin on the left for locking and support.  The
radiator is also attached to the 'engine compartment' side of the frame.

2.)  A skin on the outside with matches/lines up with the back of your bus.
It will be flush all around for a nice look.  It also has a large cutout to
exhaust air from the cooling fans out to the rear of the vehicle.  The
cooling fans are on the rear of the radiator and don't stick out past the skin.

Measure the door opening and sketch the inside opening and the outside
opening.  now draw in a rectangular frame inside the opening.  3/8 away from
right side of door opening, 1/4 away from top' and 3/4 away from left. For
my '64 this framework (1&quot; box tubing) ended up at 35-1/4 wide and 20-3/4
tall.  Now with the frame sketched in, shorten the bottom cross piece by 3&quot;
on each end.  Draw in an angled pieces that joins the sides at 8&quot; up from
bottom.  This cleared area will allow you to shape the bottom corners of the
decklid to match the bus curve at the bottom.  Add a 4&quot; long gusset across
each top corner for strength and to kit assembly square.  Cut all your
pieces, and chamfer them for welding.  I would recommend tacking the whole
thing together and checking the fit (right, left, top clearances listed
above).  Weld it all over and straighten.

Look at the right end of frame and right side of door opening.  The hinge
locations down from the top of the frame will be 2-1/2&quot;, 7&quot;, and 11-1/2&quot; to
the center of each hinge.  Cut the right side box tubing at these locations
so that you can weld in the (3/4 x 2&quot;) steel lugs at an angle.  (Look at the
mounting angle on your old decklid).  Weld them in a grind any weld off the
faces.  Clamp all 3 hinges onto a straight edge for alignment and layout
screw hole locations in the lugs.  Pay attention to which way the hinges
go...they can be put on backwards and won't work. If you have metric taps,
drill &amp; tap mounting holes for existing screws.  If not use 1/4-20 flat head
screws. Attach the top 2 hinges.

Modify the lower hinge.  Weld another 3/8 on so that it will reach.  Fill
the holes with weld and grind and re-drill holes at the same distance from
edge as other hinges.  Re-attach to frame.

Cut a piece of the 3/4 x 1/8 flat bar to 11&quot; long.  Center along all 3
(attached) hinges and transfer the hole locations to the center of the bar.
Center the holes more or less along center of strip as best you can.  Drill
and tap for 1/4-20.  This is a long nut plate which will go between the
right taillight housing and the right door frame.

Now fit the frame with hinges to the vehicle.  Don't worry to much about top
and left spacing.  You need to mount the frame so that it is 1/16 below
flush with all bus body metal.  Have someone hold it while you mark the hole
locations.  Drill thru the bus right door frame for 1/4 bolt clearance.  Use
a 5/16 drill.  Hold the 11&quot; nut plate behind the frame and see if the holes
line up.  If they do mount the decklid with 1-1/2 long 1/4-20 flat head screws.

Find a 3/8 or 7/16 bolt that you can cut up (about and inch long).  Grind a
rounded bullet type end on one end.  On the other end grind a large flat
along about half the part and thru about 1/3 of the diameter.  Fit this pin
against the left side frame about halfway down.  This will be a 'support
pin' to hold half the weight of the decklid.  Don't weld it on yet.

Make a 'striker plate' about 1-1/2 x 1-1/2 x 3/16 and fasten it behind the
bus left side door seating surface.  (The surface the door will close
against)  Use flathead 1/4-20 screws from the front.(They will be covered
with rubber trim).  Swing the decklid closed holding the bullet pin in
place, center the pin to the plate and weld it on.  Grind away any weld on
the bullet side.  Mark a hole location for the bullet pin to go thru the
striker plate, and drill.  Make sure the frame is level, even if you have to
pick it up a little bit.  This pin sets your alignment for the whole thing. 

For you latch, weld a 2&quot; x 2&quot; plate flush with the outer (skin side) of the
frame.  Locate it so that it 'latches' on the striker plate.

Radiator mounting:
On the top and bottom frame of your radiator should be plenty of holes.
Some of them will be threaded.  I built (4) brackets, 2 top, 2 bottom, and
attached them to the radiator.  Then I welded 4 'standoffs' (1&quot; box
tubing...about 4&quot; long) to the top and bottom rail of decklid frame.  I then
pinned the brackets and radiator to the frame with clevis pins for quick
removal/service.

Note: Make sure the fans do not stick out past rear of frame.

Upper hose runs to the right thru 1-1/4 steel tubing, then a full-flex hose
into engine compartment.  (I'll discuss more of plumbing on the engine side
later).  Lower hose runs to a brace (to protect from wear &amp; tear on soldered
hose fitting at bottom of radiator.  Then a 18&quot; full flex hose to the water
pump.  The upper hose floats into the battery compartment against the
battery when door is closed.  Lower hose feeds itself forward next to the
valve covers.

Adding the body metal:

Close the door and latch.  Take the 1-1/2 wide 18 gage strips and frame the
door leaving about 1/8 inch all around.  Tack weld into place.  Where the
sides come down bend strips to follow body contour all the way to the
bottom.  Add a piece across the bottom and bend in to meet sides.  Some
custom snipping will be in order here.  Once everything fits smoothly add
welds every couple of inches.  Grind flush on the outside.

Cut the body sheetmetal 'skin' to 1/2&quot; bigger than your frame all around.
Layout the large hole(s) for the fans to exhaust thru.  Fit the skin and
fold over all edges carefully and crease.  Mine needed no welding.

Add some wire mesh or whatever suits you to finish the look of the decklid.
One note:  I tried 1/4&quot; raised expanded metal first, but it created a lot of
interference for the fans.  I switched to some 1/4&quot; square wire mesh.  I
sprayed my fans and that side of the radiator flat black to help hide hardware.

License plate was relocated with a simple metal bracket coming off the right
taillight bottom screw.
