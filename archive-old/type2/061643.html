Subject: A/C into a 1971 Westfalia ??? (questions)
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

FIRST: What year did the A/C start appearing in Type II's ???

SECOND: Has anyone ever transplanted A/C into their bus ??? I know this will
be a great feat, but well worth the bother. 

I may buy an 7? bus that already has it and use this to transplant it into
mine.
