I've bought a lot of S.K tools over the decades, but at the risk of yet
another flame war...

The current Harbor Freight sale flyer/catalog [ends at Retail Stores
2-26-2001] has what appears to be the same kit, box and all, on sale for
$29.99.

I know I recently posted a message about getting what you pay for, but this
might be worth a shot.

In some cases Bus ball joints are so stubborn they require a huge industrial
press to budge them.  I know of a case locally that finally needed a monster
press at a foundry to accomplish the job.  By that time you'd probably be
better off to just go with replacement arms with new ball joints already
installed.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  I have no idea if this will work on a Bus but I was surfing and noticed
it.  The bus joint is a hare bigger than most american style FWD joints
though so...
