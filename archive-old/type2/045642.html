&gt; Hi Everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm originally from Holland and recently moved here for work
&gt; (Portland OR), so I'm not a member (yet). Have been doing some
&gt; camping and have recently rented a camper for a trip through Alaska
&gt; (onle 1 week - way to short). We (me and my wife) really liked that
&gt; and are now looking for a small camper.
&gt; So, we are looking now at buying a &quot;Riviera&quot; type2 from 79. I had a
&gt; look (and drive) at it today and it's in great condition. However, it
&gt; has run 163K and has still the 1st engine. How likely is it that
&gt; within not to much time I would have to replace the engine? And what
&gt; would that cost then? I will only use it for camping so no more then
&gt; 10K a year. The price is a littlebit over $3000.
&gt; 
&gt; Any advice is highly appriciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Groetjes,
&gt; Willem
