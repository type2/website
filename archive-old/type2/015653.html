Subject: Re: [T2] shift rod bushings - front &amp; rear


Do consider having the shift link welded. Two spot welds to hold the
cylinder to the cage. Those crimped joints can fail otherwise.

&gt;
&gt;As long as was going to have it apart, I was going to put in
&gt;a new shift coupler to put in, too. Make sense?
&gt;
&gt;Any help would be appreciated.... espeically major and minor
&gt;pit-falls, if any,  and best &quot;order of operations&quot; for the
&gt;project.
