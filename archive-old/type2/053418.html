When the AIRS site first went up I expressed my concern that it be
access limited. This is exactly why. So perhaps this is a well meaning
guy who would be interested in helping others in turn. But maybe not.
Neato doesnt publish the travel directory to non members and I dont
think this should be either. Opinions?

&gt; We got a call at home this afternoon from &quot;Shawn&quot; [Sean?] of Spokane, WA.
&gt; He was in Tacoma visiting friends.  I still don't know his last name.
&gt; 
&gt; Seems he came over Snoqualmie Pass last night in a downpour, and before he
&gt; reached the summit he lost his 1 [and only] wiper arm.  Off his '62 Type 2.
&gt; With safari windshields/windscreens.  He was desperate to find at least 1
&gt; replacement arm and blade so he could return to Spokane tonight, over
&gt; Snoqualmie Pass, in a downpour.
&gt; 
&gt; My daughter called all over the Tacoma area trying to track down the part,
&gt; without success.  I discussed the situation with Shawn, covering all
&gt; possible scenarios including a large supply of RAIN-X.  His friends found a
&gt; couple of leads up Seattle way, and Shawn was considering following them up
&gt; but his time was getting pretty tight.  He promised to let us know how his
&gt; journey home panned out.
&gt; 
&gt; The point of all this is that Shawn called me because he found my name on
&gt; the AIRS website.  And how that came about is beyond me, because Shawn was
&gt; totally unaware of the Vintagebus List or the Type 2 List, or even
&gt; Type2_dot_com.  I gave him the info. he needed to connect with the Lists, and
&gt; perhaps he'll post an account of his adventure some time.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm still amazed at how far the tentacles of the VW community and this
&gt; Internet thing really reach.  For a few hours today more than a dozen
&gt; individuals and businesses were doing all in their power to bail out a total
&gt; stranger and get him safely back on the road home.
&gt; 
&gt; FWIW.....
