Subject: it's much worse than I thought....

Hey all,
Well, I thought my clutch cable had snapped last night, but it turns out that I'm not that lucky.  The pedal is still staying up and I had a helper press the pedal while I watched underneath and the pedal is activating the operating lever like it should be.  

This means that my problem is definitely an internal clutch problem.  So, my question is what the hell happened?  I was coming to a stop, pushed the clutch in and heard a loud *snap* sound, after which the clutch would not disengage.  I  could only make it home by driving using John Muir's shifting without using the clutch method, which I must say works remarkably well.

The question is what broke?  Clutch plate?  Throwout bearing?  At any rate, the engine will have to come out to investigate.  I'd just as soon do it myself but I think my dad wants to take it to the mechanic to have it fixed.  I don't think I can talk him into pulling the engine.  I'll have the transmission oil seal and the crankshaft main oil seal replaced, as I suspect the clutch will also be oil fouled.  

Any help would be GREATLY appreciated.

Sean
