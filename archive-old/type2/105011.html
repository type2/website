&gt;I don't know what should be included in that exactly, but the job is
&gt;going to run my about $1700 with rebuilt heads. The heads are supposed
&gt;to be a lot better than the AVP and the others I have found online, and
&gt;will run me about $280 a pop. 

$1140 is a lot of labor cost for swapping cylinder heads.

&gt;Should this job include a new camshaft and matching lifters? 

A &quot;top end rebuild&quot;?  No.

&gt;I was just watching my Jake Raby video (ahh, if I could only afford one
&gt;of his lovely motors, dangit) 

I thought his basic rebuilt engine was on the order of $2500.  That's not a whole lot more than what you are paying.

&gt;We decided on a top end rebuild because the oil leak I have right now
&gt;appears to be coming down from the passenger side head, but probably
&gt;from the top two bolts because we tightened the bottom two, cleaned it
&gt;up and ran it again, and again I had oil. Plus, the bottom ones weren't
&gt;out of spec when we checked.

Are you talking about the cylinder head bolts?  These do not leak oil - they are not attached to anything that handles oil.  Oil leaks on the passenger side of the engine could only be from a few sources.  Base of the cylinders, pushrod tubes (either end), fuel pump, dipstick tube, thermostat cable pulley hole, valve cover gasket.  That's about it, assuming nothing is cracked.

&gt; When I mentioned that when I fire it up I
&gt;get a pretty nasty blue cloud some days, that's when they said I had
&gt;blow-by, and while working on this one head might fix this, it could be
&gt;the other one, and a top end rebuilt would be the ideal fix for it,

Reality check - blowby will not be cured with a top-end rebuild!  Unless their idea of a top-end rebuild includes honing the cylinders and replacing the rings.

Now if they misspoke and really meant worn valve guides, then yes, that would be included in a top-end rebuild.

&gt;although we could just work on this one head and see what happens when
&gt;were done. It would be about $700 for just repairing the one head,
&gt;replacing the gasket for it or whatever would stop that oil leak. 

Why don't they do a proper diagnosis before asking you to make a decision?  Has anyone given this engine a COMPRESSION CHECK?  How about a leakdown test?  It should be a relatively simple matter to determine whether the smoke is the result of rings or valves and take the appropriate action.

&gt;So, its another grand to just do the whole thing, which is what I may
&gt;have to do anyway after the first thing mentioned is done, so why take
&gt;chances?

Because it's &quot;another grand&quot;, which is not exactly chump change, is it?  And would that be guaranteed to cure the nasty-blue-cloud problem?  Ask them.

&gt;After all of the talking, I am a little confused on why I would need new
&gt;heads when just needing to reseal it up nice, but I don't know jack
&gt;about these things, so ? 

I may get flamed for saying this, but if your existing heads have 50k miles or more on them, it is probably a good idea to have them rebuilt.  Aircooled motors run hot and exhaust valves can stretch and break.  But it sounds like they are using a different justification, if any.

&gt;If the bottom end is actually the original original motors, and only the
&gt;heads were replaced last time, then the bottom end technically has about
&gt;195,000 miles on it, and I should probably be replacing it as well,
&gt;right? 

Is there anything wrong with it?  If not, and it has been properly maintained... well I would leave it alone but you will have to make a judgement call on that one.  Some people just &quot;feel better&quot; knowing they have a fresh motor under the hood (or deck, in our case!).
