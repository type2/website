Was the engine you bought from MOFOCO (or any of the other vendors)
&quot;turnkeys&quot; or &quot;longblocks&quot;?  It seems on the one hand I could save a
good bit of money with a longblock... But on the other... with a turnkey
I would know that I have parts that go with the motor and might &quot;perform
better?&quot;

==&gt; My first was a 1914 from MOFOCO which ... It has performed
flawlessly even when run in fairly extreme conditions.

==&gt; Which is better... Rebuild your engine, buy a longblock, or buy a
turnkey?
