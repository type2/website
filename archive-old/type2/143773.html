Subject: Re: [T2] connection on tranny question...

not sure but sounds like you are talking about the reverse lights wires???? those wires should run back on the right hand side through the frame there from tranny next to ground strap...... into the engine bay area back to the reverse lights. or did on mine ???
good luck just what it sounds like maybe someone else may know better...
peace and love

Hi,

Right next to the ground strap on the tranny are a few wires also
plugged into the tranny. What are these? Looks like I need to clean them
but what do they go to?. FI 1977 Westy
