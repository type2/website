Hi volks,

Well been a pretty terrible day today.  Driving home from work someone else
decided that a stop sign was just a pretty thing to look at and kept going
right thru the intersection and into my sliding door.  Toasted the door,
flattenned the tire messed up the front dogleg, but I still drove home once I
put on the spare.
  Well my question is what year sliders are interchangable?  I have a 73 and
know the lock was mounted in the door starting in 74, but can it still be
used?
If you want to know which will hold up better a bus or a 98 toy*** .  I did
drive the bus home,  the car was totalled.


Just a reminder only 7 days until the Lowcountry Bus Festival.

I will be there even if I have to go as is.

Peace
