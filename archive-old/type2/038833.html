If you are sure you checked the oil a few days ago and you didn't know of 
any leaks than that would be an odd thing for your engine to do.  if the oil 
on the dipstick was 3/4 between the two lines that is right.  Did you know 
of any cooling problems?  Do you remember any loud noises...or clattering of 
valves?  Find out exactly what the compression of the engine is before that 
mechanic pulls anything apart!
