Subject: Child's Hammock

VW folk,

I found a child's hammock at a junk yard from an early 70's camper. After
getting it home and doing a fit check in my 1976 I found that the poles
were both about 1 inch too short to fit in the '76 mounting hooks. The 
hammock poles are both 55.5 inches long and the mounting hooks on my 1976 
Westfalia are 56.5 apart. Does anyone know what is happening here. The hammock 
poles are round tube steel about 5/8 inch in diameter with mounting tabs welded
on each end. The tubes are painted balck and the canvas is a brownish green
color.

Are the early child's hammocks different than the later (1976) types?
Any comments are appreciated!

Jim
