     ????? I drive a pop-top, and have Yakima racks on it. Carry a big
streamlined box and two sailboards pretty regularly plus sometimes a bike,
and sometimes a canoe instead of the sailboards.  What's wrong with a top
carrier on a pop-top? Other than as I said before, putting the bike on and
off is a serious hassle -- too much of one, IMHO.
