Subject: 1970 High Top For Sale

Hello Everyone,

My hightop is for sale. I have moved to NC and cannot find a way to get the bus up here. 

You can see it at:
http://f1.pg.photos.yahoo_dot_com/bc/stephaniedittrick/lst?.dir=/Steph%27s+VDub+Type2&amp;.view=t

The inside has been sanded, primed and painted. The cargo floor is not and needs work. There is a missing driver's side window. The passenger and driver doors need new window mechanisms. The engine is well maintained and spanking clean, but needs one spark plug retapped and the ignition wire was cut to redo the interior. All the tires are brand new.

The LP system, bed and cabinetry have been taken out to redo the inside.

I am selling it for $200.00 firm. It is located in Fort Myers, Florida.

The rubber for this bus is being sold separately. If you are interested, I have the slider and front door rubber.

Please call Steph at 704-982-7673.

Still plan on seeing you all at rally's as I am going to be looking for a bus up here in NC.
