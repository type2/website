Subject: re Mexican thermostat

I put a Mexican thermostat setup on my 1776 single port head/doghouse cooler 
engine. The rod that came with the CIP kit worked perfectly, it dropped 
right down through the hole in the fins and the thermostat spun on. There 
were no fitment issues, it was pretty easy.  I didn't have an older rod to 
compare it with, so I can't answer that one.. My bus runs nice and cool, and 
has great heat. At any rate, it hasn't overheated at all. I can always grab 
the dipstick after  a long highway run.

&lt;I have a Mexican thermostat and bracket but they don't seem to fit on my
'71.

1. Can the original flap pushrod be used with the Mexican setup or is a
different pushrod necessary?

2. If anyone has successfully installed one of these, did it just 'bolt
right in' or were some other steps required? (i.e. did any pieces need
to be cut, etc.?) What year bus did you install it in?

Thanks in advance,
Bill Moon&gt;
