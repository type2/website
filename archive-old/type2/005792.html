Subject: [T2] German Mechanical Fuel Pumps are Back!


&gt; For those of you who prefer the original-equipment mechanical fuel pumps
on
&gt; your '72-74 (carbureted) bus...
&gt;
&gt; For the last two years, affordable pumps have been unavailable, since the
&gt; $70 South American ones were discontinued, and German ones were just too
&gt; expensive at more than twice that price.
&gt;
&gt; I just bought a dozen brand new original-equipment German made Pierburg
&gt; mechanical fuel pumps, from a distributor who discovered them forgotten on
a
&gt; dusty shelf.  I don't think he realized how expensive they had gotten
since
&gt; he'd put them there, as he sold them to be based on the cost he had paid
at
&gt; that time.
&gt;
&gt; So, they are $99.95 while they last. Part number 021 127 025A ; order
&gt; toll-free or via the website.  Once they're gone, it's back to around $150
&gt; for these babies. :-(
