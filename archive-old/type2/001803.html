&gt;  BTW, the Wolfsburg West repros for these do not include the vertical
&gt;  panel in the aisle.


Actually, there are a total of four pieces that you need to make up a
complete set.  The Wolfsburg West repros (which I also sell) are packaged
two and two.  There is a pair of inner mats (for the area between the seats)
and a pair of outer mats (for the area under the seats).  If you buy both
sets you should have everything you need.
