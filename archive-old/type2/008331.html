Just as a related side-issue, what is the capacity of the brake hydraulic
system? I changed my fluid today, by bleeding all the brakes but instead
of giving 3-4 presses with the &quot;One Man&quot; brake bleeding kit, using about
15-20 each wheel. I used from the reservoir (under the drivers seat) high
to low mark (then topped up) for the nearest wheel, then 1½-2 of these
for the other wheels, and got through a whole 500ml bottle. Incidentally
I used DOT 4 becuase the bloke at the FLAPS didn't know which I should use
and looked it up in a Vanagon manual.

But, have I completely replaced the fluid?

&gt;Wonder where it went?

I bet it went into the booster.  Been there, done that!
