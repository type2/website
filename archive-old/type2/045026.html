Subject: Re: [T2] Engine options

So, to reiterate (because I want to make sure I'm very, very clear on this):

If I get a 78 2.0L with hydraulic lifters and a 210mm flywheel from AVP,
I can drop it into my old engine compartment on my 73, without having to
upgrade either a) my starter, b) my engine tin, or c) my heat
exchangers. I *will* have to rejet my carbs to compensate for the
increased displacement.
