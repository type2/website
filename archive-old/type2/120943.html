Subject: Re: [T2] sand blasting/paint prep &amp; walnut media???

I have psoriasis problems with the hands (split skin on fingers) and
found paint remover very sporadic- SO
For $85/hr (2 hr) I had the entire roof, front, under the rocker panels,
and under the gutters sandblasted (we masked the glass)- they used a
real fine sand and just a
surface hand sanding/palm orbital got it ready for priming.  No
rippling, but the rust pits in the roof (PO hald left it tarped) and
pits from flying debris in the nose came out clean as a whistle (the
rust travels farther under the orig paint than you'd believe); after
priming with highly recc variprime (DuPont) I used putty filler and it
looks fine, no final coat yet.

 I've heard sand blasting can create ripples in the metal if you aren't
 careful.  I don't intend on removing all the paint but there are areas
 in the front, the roof, the rear hatch that need to be taken down a
 lot and grinding with sand paper on large areas will take forever.
