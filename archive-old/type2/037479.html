Subject: Re: towing a '79 on a dolly

&gt;... I'm planning on towing a 1979 van from NH to Toronto (approx. 700
&gt;miles) next weekend. I'll be using a tow dolly  to pull it back, should be
a nice &gt;slow, easy cruise.

Beware that you may need to carry spare tires with you if you &quot;dolly&quot; the
van with the rear wheels down.  I towed a '81 westy from Denver to Michigan
a few years ago and it didn't occur to me that the angle of the rear wheels
changes when the van is not parallel to the ground. Just look at the rear of
your van when it's sitting on the ground, the top of the wheels are tilted
in. That's fine if you are sitting level, but imagine rotating the front of
the van upwards and you can visualize that the contact patch of the tires
are now &quot;toe'd out&quot;.  I always check the bearing and tire temps while towing
and that saved me from loosing a good set of tires early.  I changed to
expendable tires and let them wear.  I did make the trip, but the tires that
were on, were scrap when the trip was over.  Concerning your second concern,
a manual will tow indefinately, and auto will not.  If you still have the
axles on without a tranny,  or its an auto, you will need to pull the axles
and store them until you arrive home

&lt;The van in question has no transmission, but the axles are still in place.
&lt;The owner has heard that moving the van without the transmission may
&lt;damage
&lt;the wheel bearings. Is that so?

NO,  That would be a problem on say a Rabbit where the axle comes out of the
front hub instead of disconnecting from the axle stub (as in a van). In that
case, the bearings would have no compression on them and likely fail.

&lt;If it is,  would there be any problem towing the van with the rear wheels
on
&lt;the dolly instead?
 .As for towing backwards ( on a dolly), I have no experience doing so, but
since the front beam controls the wheels in parallel, it may work better.
