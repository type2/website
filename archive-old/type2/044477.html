&gt;  Any thoughts?

     My favorite argument on this and similar corner cutting subjects 
(read:thermostat) is as follows: VW wants to make a profit. It's cheaper 
to put a 1600 engine in a breadloaf unmodified. VW didn't do that. In 
Europe, where 1600 breadloaves existed, they went to a lot of trouble 
(and expense) to redesign the tin. Why? I'm not one of the engineers that 
made the decision, but if I had to Monday AM QB that game I'd say it was 
to ensure no air leaked. Granted, it may have been a PHB thing, but I'd 
be putting money on the former rather than the latter, were I a betting 
man...
