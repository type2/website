&gt;What I see when I look through the orifice is a moveable metal vane

That's how the AAR works.

Unless you've got a vacuum leak from the two hoses and elbow that connect it to the manifold, because it bypasses the throttle it's responsible for raising the idle not lowering it because it's not closed.

What kind of lifters do you have, solid or hydraulic?
