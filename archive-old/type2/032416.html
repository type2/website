You may not need to replace them. They tend to crack around the connections. If you pull off the connections one at a time , trim the icky part off and reconnect you might just be ok. The are hard to get back on so here is some advice. Cut a small piece of 220 grit sandpaper and fold it in half so that the grit faces out both ways. Wrap it around the end of the hose. The sandpaper will give your fingers something to grip to and the grit will grab the hose. Doing this will allow you too push the hose over the barb on the fittings.

&gt; Hey Folks,

I'm new to the list and hope someone has had a similar problem.

When I try to wash the windshield, I end up with washer fluid on my shoe.  
I'm wondering if anyone has advice on how to change/replace the hose.
