    Figure the perfect '76 is worth $2K and the Westie stuff
is worth another $2K, and $500 either way, since its perfect,
isn't a surprise. Offer $4K cash and see if they take it.

I missed the original post, but want to add that even a perfect looking Westy 
may have some hidden problems.  I paid only $500 for my perfect looking Westy 
over 10 years ago.  It had 125,000 miles on the original engine.  I now have 
a recent rebuild and loads of other new parts.  I would not take $5,500 for 
it now.

You are taking a risk if you don't know if the engine is in great condition.  
Even my 125,000 mile $500 find had great compression.  I later discovered bad 
valve guides.

For $4,500 or more, I would expect a clean recent reputable rebuilt engine.
