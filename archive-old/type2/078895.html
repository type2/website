Subject: RE: Is airconditioning a good idea in stock 71 Westy? 


-Snip-   [william was thinking about putting A/C in his bus]

Hi William

Here is some of my advice and thoughts on this
When I purchased my bus it had air conditioning in it minus
the compressor so it did not work.  During the first month I
turned on the fans in the overhead unit a few times just imagining :)
The fact is now 1 year later I have removed the unit and stored
it in the garage.  I did do some research on the whole setup.
To me it seemed that the engine didn't have a whole lot of
power to spare to begin with - 2000cc engine.  That plus the
idea of getting the compressor some how mounted in the engine
didn't excite me too much. Some time ago to PO had it removed
so I needed the compressor and mount for it.  I might install it
again later thats why I saved it but for now it's fine sitting
in the garage sealed up on a shelf.
I would imagine the compressor puts some sort of strain on the
engine.  That plus the extra weight of overhead unit, and
evaporators would also put more of a strain on the engine.
To counter that though i've heard some people say that it has
not reduced the life of their engine.

To me it wasn't worth it, I live in Tennessee and its not
to hot for me.
I'm sure for some that its the other way around and they
have good reasons to have A/C. Kids , wife , themselves

About the ducting if I understand what your asking, they
have a overhead unit that is usually located above the front
seats.  This is what my bus had, and it reduces some of
the interior room.  I'm tall and it made it a little
more difficult to move through the walk through to the back.
They also have a unit that goes under the dash,
I don't know much about this one though, sorry.

Also the library on type2_dot_com has some info
on air conditioners.

just my opinions
