Thought I'd share a little victory story, if you'll all put up with it!
Don't worry, it's got bus content...
I've been eyeing a '74 loaf w/auto trans with a for sale sign in it saying
$250 OBO.  I called to buy it for parts for my '72 and the guy decided he'd
rather take bids than just sell it.  He called back several days later
telling me he had other offers and that we'd have to go higher than $250,
and if we did then he'd give the others a chance to top me, and on and on
and on.   It wasn't important enough for me to go through the bother so I
told him I was going to pass.  Fast forward a week later and he calls me
again.  Turns out his other buyers was actually one other guy and he backed
out.   The guy tells me he'd sell it to me now for $130........... SOLD
    I love it when things work out!
