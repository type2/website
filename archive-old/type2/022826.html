Rod: I operate two late model busses with upright engines but this trick 
might be of help on your installation. Since these engines had no provision 
for CHT monitoring, and, there is insufficient clearance in the spark plug 
well to permit the conventional spark plug washer type sensor, I simply glued 
the ring sensor to the engine case on a flat surface adjacent to the #3 cyl 
exhaust outlet( normally the hottest cyl) using 
J B Weld. Neither units have come loose in two years. Gives an uncalibrated 
but  reasonably reliable relative indication, which is probably all you are 
looking for anyway. Ray, 68 Kombiwagen, 69 Transporter
