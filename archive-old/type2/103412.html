Subject: Re: [T2] Dual webers

&gt;Anyone out there have any exp. fitting dual webers to1600tp 
&gt;engine?-any help gratefully accepted-Martin

I'm a little light on 1600 practical experience, but I can tell you without
a doubt that dual Weber 40 IDF's are way too much carb for a stock 1600.
Even with 28mm venturis, they just move too much volume.  If you're dead set
on running dual Webers, look to the 36's.  Or consider running a single 40
IDF.

I ran dual 40 IDF's on a fresh 1776 in my single cab a few years back, but
never got them set up to run efficiently (hopefully Matt has got Zorm
running better than 15 MPG by now).

Dual carbs in general are a little more trouble than a single carb because
you've got them get them synched and keep them that way.  If you're a
first-timer, you'd do best to get some help from someone that's been doing
duals for a while.  Once you get the hang of it it's a piece of cake.  

One other thing:  If you do decide to go duals, don't bother with that
rinky-dink Bug-Pack piece-o-crap linkage that some of the discount houses
include with their dual carb packages.  Spend the extra bucks ($100 or so)
and get a Weber X-bar linkage or something similar.
