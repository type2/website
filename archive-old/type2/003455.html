&gt; Just had a complete tune-up done on my new bus and it seems to be running
a
&gt; lot better, but I still feel some hesitation in 2nd, 3rd, and 4th gears.
&gt; When I try to get on the highway I am lucky to be doing 40 when I merge.
I
&gt; can get it up to 65 but that is it.  I read the other day how someone was
&gt; able to cruise at 70 all day long, how?  The second I start going up the
&gt; slightest grade I am down to 55.  This is my first VW so maybe I just
don't
&gt; understand, but I am sure these things have a little more power.
&gt;
&gt; What should I do, look at, etc?

You need to say what year and engine you have. And if any mods have been
done, i.e. fuel injection removed and a carb put on, a 009 dist is installed
etc.


&gt; My machanic said to oil something in the distributer, that might be what
is
&gt; causing the hesitation.
&gt; I am new to this, and didn't want to sound like an idiot in front of him
so
&gt; I said I understood, well I don't, what do I oil?

What he is referring to is under the rotor. You remove the cap, remove the
rotor, and put a few drops of oil in the felt pad in the center. This
lubricates the upper shaft so the centrifigul advance keeps working. A good
maintenance item but I am not sure it will fix a hesitation problem.

&gt; This is a brand new
&gt; distributor, what should I be looking at?
