Subject: '79 crossover pipe - Maryland (rant!!)

I visited a '79 bus, with a crossover pipe in a junkyard yesterday.

It was still on the engine, with a 'U' and cat converter and muffler AND EGR 
filter.

. . .  And decent heat exchangers.


Now, a real busma dealer could probably buy the whole engine for about 
$150!!  Torch the axles and you pick up two solid CV's plus boots in the 
bargin.  Remember to take the brain and fuel pump and ...
(Personally, I would like just the hydraulic lifters and rest of stuff to 
convert a solid lifter to hydraulics, so if I ever get back there, cosider 
the engine 'trashed'.)

The '79 has ('had', if you get there a day late; dollar short) four really 
decent Bridgestone 185R14 light truck tires, like '603' or something.  
Mounted, balanced, rims, etc for like $27 each.  Great thing to ride on 
while you are getting your personal rims power coated!!

See my previous post on 'fresh meat' for more info and locations


BTW, I picked up an EGR filter (not connected) off a Blue Vanagon camper 
'80, along with the 'like new' coil for $5 each.

(This '80 had what looked like stainless heat exchangers; I did not want to 
get dirty looking at it any closer)

The bargains are there TO-DAY . . .

Now, these two yards are crush happy, that is why I am advising the MD - 
NOVA listees to go out here and get these parts NOW!!

What was lost in the past month:  Two '73's, one auto one stick camper with 
real nice interior (I got both starters); one fairly well stripped '77 white 
hardtop camper ( I got the driver side jealousy - it was SOLID!!) with a 
real nice inside roof cabinet.  You know, the one over the engine, with the 
curve on top so you could convert your bus into a camper!! Plus the needed 
side cabinet and all the hardware.

Also lost were a few Vanagons...  any my interest in VWs.
