Subject: Speaking of clutches...

Hi all,
Here's a question that will brand me a newbie fer sure! My clutch 
&quot;comes in&quot; right at the floorboard. 77' bus 70-something T-4. 
The cable seems to be at the end of it's adjustment. The main symptom 
is that it's difficult to get it into gear and there is a thump when 
you put it in reverse. The upshot is I need a &quot;quick fix&quot; to get 
me through emissions here in Phoenix. Once I get my tags I can pull 
the motor and put a new clutch in.
I need tags to get my apartment complex off my back.

Thanks in advance,
Jeff
77' bus &quot;Frijole&quot;
