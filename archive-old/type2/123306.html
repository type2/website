Subject: Re: [T2] '69 and a '71 bus comparison !

Tony,

Can we divide the choice into two classes?

Campers and standard?  Since I haven't been in a camper in quite awhile...

I surely do like my 78 Champagne edition just like it is...although
I really might like a little more subtle interior.

I can't think of anything that it is lacking in terms of improvements
over earlier years...wups! 

except it has earlier model heater boxes and exhaust...that is a definite 
plus!...sliding side windows, so no window rust.  Waste heat dumps
on the heater box flappers so that you don't fry your starter from the
waste heat.  


Cheers, dave

&gt; Say the list hit the last lottery...What would the &quot;reasonably perfect&quot;
&gt; bus have? Answers limited to stuff on 68-79 only, mix 'n match your
&gt; features/deletions...(Doktor Tim not eligible since each bus was per-
&gt; fect when it left Germany and only imperfect owners ruined them... ;-(
