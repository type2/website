Subject: Re: [T2] At least buses don't face these crosswinds

&gt; I used to yearn for a Vespa too and a tiny MGB. Now I want a 
&gt; cabriolet ('93-94 if anyone has one- white of course)  and I did have 
&gt; one of the first Fiat 850's over here. The first few had sloping 
&gt; headlights - like a baby Jag.
&gt; Funny how young people now seem to want HUMMERS!

And HOW! The 2CV gave me an itch for a Beetle with a full length canvas
top. I have seen kits. Not my current Beetle, maybe the next one. Also
wishing for a Vespa and a Fiat 500. Left a 500 in Naples when I moved
(against my will, blame it on the Navy...) to VA.
