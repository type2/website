&lt;&lt; There are a lot of funny statistics on that website. A agree that the 
car seems to violate a couple of the laws of thermodynamics. If you 
are taking ambient air pressure, pressurizing it, then depressurizing 
it to run the vehicle, you can't end up with a net heat loss. The air 
out of the drive &quot;motor&quot; may be cold, but the compressor system will 
require some cooling.

Did you also notice that the &quot;Air Car&quot; is a subsidary of
