Subject: Oil leak ideas?

1976 Bus, 2L engine.

I am trying to find the leak on the left side of the engine.  It is dripping
from above the oil relief valve .  I replaced the oil cooler, used new seals,
and torqued to 60inlb.  The oil pressure switch does not appear to be leaking,
nor the distributor. Is the oil filter mounting flange a common place for
leaks?  Does anyone know the torque value for the filter mount to the case?

Any other suggestions would be appreciated.

I guess that is what I get for switching to a winter oil.
Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
