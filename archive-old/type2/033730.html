Subject: cylinder walls

I'm rebuilding my 1776 for the third time. Total of about 1000 miles on a
new set of Mahle Ps and Cs.  When I bought these from Berg, I declined the
option of having the glaze cut done before shipment.

As I get ready to install these, I notice that the cylinder walls have
lines parallel to the cylinder axis. Not goughes, but lines.  I cannot feel
them if I drag my fingernail over the wall.

My questions:
First: what is accomplished by having that special glaze cut which Berg
describes in the catalog? Why is the pattern that the tool creates of
interest to me?

Secondly:  I find that a short rub with 400 paper erases the lines in my
cylinders.  The pattern left by the paper is, of course, a random one.  I'm
tempted to limit my prep to a thorough rub with the 400 paper.  Is this
wise? Is it sufficient?

Thanks, Jack
