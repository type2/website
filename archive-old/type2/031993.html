I have an EMPI cooler like the one recommended to you. I bought it from 
ORV Warehouse in San Marcos (San Diego COunty, CA). They are a chain. I 
can't remember how much I paid (some 6 years ago) but it was on the order 
of $50-$80, plus a few more tens of dollars for the hoses, fittings, and 
external oil filter mount, hose clamps, bolts, hose mounters and plastic 
ties.

Where to put it is a question. You want it to get good airflow but be 
inacessible to rocks and punk kids. Some mount them outside on the 
driver's side beneath the air scoop. This gets good airflow, but is 
accessible to punk kids and is an eyesore. Some mount them inside the 
tower on the driver's side, where they are out of sight and getting good 
aiurflow from the scoop (at least when you're going fast) but you are 
preheating the engines cooling air. 

Bob Hoover recommended mounting them (for 1600 engines) directly over the 
engine fan housing so that fan sucks air through it. Again, you are 
preheating engine cooling air, but the heat load in either case is 
distributed across all 4 cylinders. I was surprised that a detail 
oriented guy like him would recommend mounting it in the engine 
compartment at all, but there are other advantages I guess (easy, out of 
sight, no extra fan needed).

I mounted mine underneath, driver's side, about where the drain for the
'frig comes down. Used plumber's helper strips to create a place to mount,
and ran hoses forward neatly to it. External oil filter mount goes just
foreward of the cooler underneath. It lowered my oil temp about 30 degrees
F immediately. I usually run abour 200-210 on warmish CA days. On a midday
run across AZ in July I was running about 250F at 60mph. On cold days I
barely get up to the 180F mark, which is the least you should be running
at for operating temp. You can't see it and neither can the punk kids but
it is potentially vulnerable to rocks. I figure the worst that could
happen is I take a big hit in the cooler in remotest Baja and lose all my
oil. So I travel with minimum 6 quarts extra and oil filters. Worst case
happens and I just spin off the mount attached to the stock filter, put a
filter on there like VW intended, fill 'er up, and off I go. I've driven 
some gnarly roads in the last five years and had no trouble there yet 
(I've been hit other places hard twice, but those are other stories- the 
risk is real). 

I figured an air scoop of some sort would increase my airflow through the 
thing so I made one out of an old gas can. It did not noticeably lower my 
oil temp further and it got ripped off on a rock in the desert. I may 
make another one someday, but it's not a priority for me. I've imagine 
building a strong cage to protect the thing from rocks, but made no 
progress towards actually building it. 

I live in Santa Barbara CA where it never really gets cold at all, so I 
don't have a thermostat on the oil system. If you live where it gets cold 
at all, you should install one. They run (um...) about $50? You would put 
it near the engine and it loops 90% of the oil right back into the engine 
until oil temp hits 210, then it runs it all through the aux. cooler. It 
keeps 10% running through there all the time to keep things clean and 
lubed out there. Seems like a really good idea for anyone where it gets cold.

Many talk about installing a big electric fan to blow air through the 
cooler when you're going slowly and it's really hot. These fans are big- 
they suck lots of current. I guess if you really want to run a bus in the 
desert all the time it might be worth it, but as the installation becomes 
more and more involved it begins to beg the question, &quot;Why not just run a 
watercooled engine?&quot; I've done just fine without a big fan, even on heavy 
summer desert runs. You might just think about avoiding heat by driving 
in the cooler times of day, etc., rather than charging for a heavy handed 
technofix that would keep you cool on Judgement Day at high nooon with a 
2000 pound payload on a steep grade.

It has been said many times before and I believe it's really true that if 
you take care to clean your engine, tune it up, seal all the airleaks in 
the engine compartment, manufacture solutions to all the air gaskets that 
are no longer available, and get the engine compartment really tight, the 
stock 2.0L engine runs pretty cool.

IN retrospect, I question the need for an external oil cooler. I installed
one because my bus had a regular operating oil temp (measured in the
oilpan) of 250F and John Muir and others had led me to believe that oil
suffers irreversible viscosity breakdowns above 210F. With my oil cooler,
I run below 210F most of the time. But oil gets much hotter in the heads
than it is in the pan, so oil is going well above 210 on every trip
through the engine. Bob Hoover used thermocouples to collect real data on
1600 engines and recorded temps of hundreds of degrees hotter up there!
And there have been endless discussions here about synthetic oils (which I
do not use) and some discussion of chemistry changes since the '70's when
Muir was opining. And many say that Muir didn't know what he was talking
about anyways. No one seems to have authoritative information on this
subject anyways (just try to find out how hot is too hot from any official
VW source- they won't really tell you). So go figure. I drive under
extreme conditions sometimes (summer Baja surftrips to very remote places
where a blown head would definitely ruin your day) so I erred on the side
of caution. And I always have low level worry about whether slightly 
slower warm up might wear my engine out faster than lower operating 
temps.
