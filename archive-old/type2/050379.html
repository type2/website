Subject: [T2] fusebox/battery

I recently bought a battery at Wal-Mart that works really well. 
Just get one that is the right size and has the posts on top.
The battery that was listed at Wal-Mart for the bus is somewhat
smaller than the one that I bought. I wanted to be able to
use battery power for a while with the engine off.

&gt; I went to my FLAPS and I was flabbergasted when they told me, &quot;We don't
&gt; carry a battery for a 76 Transporter, nor do I even have a listing for
it.&quot;
