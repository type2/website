Subject: safety record

Aside from anecdotal evidence, are there any official reports or stats
on safety issues with 68-79 Transporters? Although we only use the
camper a few months every year for our annual road holidays and I am a
very slow (even by type 2 standards) and defensive driver, I have always
been worried about safety of my occupants in case of crash throughout
almost 20 years of driving a VW bus. I will install new seatbelts (not
from a junkyard!) this spring and make sure all passengers (4 kids, wife
and me) are always buckled up. Still, am I right to be worried? I
checked all the articles and reviews in the Brooklands Road Test book
but did not find much about safety except a statement about the new 72
Kombi that said that &quot;it sets new standards in performance and safety&quot;.
Hmmmm...that's reassuring...
