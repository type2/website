Subject: RE: ignition

As far as operating the ignition switch with a broken return spring, as this 
thread shows, the switch can jam in most any position.  It jammed on Ron in 
the start position and wouldn't return out of start leaving the starter 
engaged.  With broken parts floating around in there, most anything is 
possible.  Were it my bus, I'd look at a replacement soon.
