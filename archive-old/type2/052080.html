Subject: [T2] Swearing, screaming, and starting

Esteemed List,

It looks as if I'm going to have to pull out my starter this weekend.  It's 
making like the drive pinion is going out so............  I went to check my 
bus manuals on removing the starter.  I've never done this before in a Bus.  
(Mine is a 70, stock set-up).  
However, I have done my share of Bugs.  Luckily I have a friend who is part 
contortionist and can get a wrench on that &quot;in back of the shroud nut&quot; which 
secures the starter bolt in Bugs.
So, I went to the manuals to see what all is involved in pulling a starter 
out of a Bus.  The Clymer and VW manuals simply advise to &quot;remove the two 
bolts securing the starter to the transaxle&quot;.  &quot;OK!&quot;, I'm thinking.  But 
Bentley says I'll need a friend to undo the nut inside the engine 
compartment.  C'mon now!  It's hard enough in a Bug; that's gotta be 
impossible to get back there in a Bus.  
What's the story here, List?  Does somebody really have to get a wrench back 
there behind the shroud?  Or do the bolts just come out from the starter 
side?
