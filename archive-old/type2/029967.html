&gt; &gt; 2) What PSI is the windsheild washer bottle supposed to be at?
&gt; 
&gt; that would be an item for the owners manual

42PSI

&gt; &gt; 3) How much fuel does the RESERVE hold? (mine seems to last forever!!)
&gt; 
&gt; not listed that I could find, drive until you reach R, fill it up, subtract amount
&gt; filled from 15.8 and that's your reserve.

You can't use it all.  The last half gallon or so is unusable, as I found
when I carefully drained the last bit out of the tank to clean the screen.
I didn't spill a drop, since I just put the disconnected fuel line into
the fuel jug and left it until it stopped dripping.  Then I cracked the
nut to remove the screen and got a gasoline bath.  Then I very carefully
set the wrench down (no sparks, please!) and went to change my clothes.
