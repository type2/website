Subject: T4 2.4L with Porsche Fan

Volks,

Someone posted a link recently to a stainless exhaust header sold
by a European company.  I always click
biz's so I can bookmark them for future needs... quite a
collection I've amassed so far!

Anyway, I encourage everyone to check out the &quot;NEWS&quot; section and
take a gander at the T4 2.4L
motor shown at a whopping 3,784E.  Am I ignorant, too sheltered,
or what?  That's the strangest setup
I've seen on a T4....interesting!  Is this a common mod among
mods?  I think Raby's Porsche kits are
upright, aren't they?

Incidentally, I kept asking myself... man, woe the day that belt
brakes.  Lots of friction surface.  Eek!

p.s.  Mike, of Casting... drop me an email at
jlsmi11_at_earthlink_noVWspam__dot_net  I can receive emails
at that account, but not send.  Problem solved.
