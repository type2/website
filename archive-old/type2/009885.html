I've used TUFOIL additive in my 78 Westy engine ever since I got it at
60K....never rebuilt it, and have 202,700 mi now on it....get 20mpg still
with 135lbs compression.   Is it TUFOIL (aPTFE additive that's been proven
to extend the life of warehouse machines) or dumb luck or sensible
driving??  Obviously hasn't hurt it!  Seeya at Litchfield!
