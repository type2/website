Subject: Re: [T2] VW Trademarks

I wonder what ever happened to the &quot;hobbiest&quot; license that was on the 
net earlier this year. I signed up WetWesties just to see what would 
happen.  So far, no word either yea or nay. And WW prominently displays 
the VW trademark.... &lt;http://wetwesties_dot_org&gt; Maybe they're ignoring me 
because there's no commercial aspect.

Jim
