Subject: Re: [T2] oil breather hose diameter?

&lt;&lt; I just replaced this hose on my 79 and assuming it's the same size I
just replaced it with a 3/4&quot; radiator hose that had a nice 90 degree
bend in it. It was a little tight and the hose wall is larger, but so
far it seems to be working fine.
 &gt;&gt;

Again, be sure about these replacement hoses. I can't say for sure,
but a hose built to carry water and antifreeze, might not be good in
an oily situation. My guess would be the maker isn't gonna overbuild
a hose for more than its intended use.
