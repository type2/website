Hey y'all
It is possible to replace the rear wheel bearings with the carrier still on 
the bus.  I almost did it on the bus last time I did rear bearings but 
decided to remove the carrier so I could get better pictures.  You have to 
remove the axle from the stub axle and keep it out of the way while you 
perform the operation.  You do not have to remove the backing plate but you 
might want to at least remove your brake shoes 'cause things are gonna get 
greasy soon.  You can drive the stub axle out, I use an old castellated nut 
I keep in the spare bus locker for just this purpose.  Remember that there's 
2 yes count them, 2 big spring circlips that hide behind the seals.  Once 
you have the seals and circlips out, the outer bearing should come out no 
problem.  You can then drive the inner bearing and outer race out of the 
carrier.

Now for the fun part.  The carrier gets really dirty on the outside from CV 
joint lube and grease and road gunk so you've already managed to get this in 
your CV joint but we'll worry about that later.  For not, clean clean clean. 
  As nature abhors a vacuum, bearings hate dirt.  You'll spend lots of time 
cleaning, while sitting on the ground, scattering all the little parts you 
laid out while disassembling the axle and such.  Once it's all clean and 
shiny you can then install the new bearings, the spacers, circlips, and 
seals just like it came apart.  Reinstall your nice clean stub axle, grease 
it slightly so it doesn't tear the seals as it goes through.  You'll have to 
persuade it to go through the bearings, I use the handle side of a 5lb 
hammer, as gently as possible.  Reinstall your brake shoes, then the drum.  
You'll have to give the axle nut a couple tightenings as you go, because 
they seem to work their way in slowly.  Clean your CV joint as best you can 
after having gotten crud in it, add grease as needed, find the CV joint 
mounting bolts and spacers and such that you managed to scatter all over the 
place, and reinstall.  Adjust your brakes.  Clean up the mess, drive it 
around the block, then check the torque on the axle nut again.

After all this, think about how much easier the cleaning and such would have 
gone if you had been able to just set it on a bench.

Have fun, and let us know how it went.

Mad Uncle Dave
