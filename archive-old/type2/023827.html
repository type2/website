Subject: 1999 Reimo Camper Accessory Catalogs from Germany
Message-ID: &lt;67195b4a.243845d7_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I have just received the 1999 Reimo Camping catalogs from Germany.

Over 300 pages of cool stuff for small campers.  Lots of stuff is specific to 
Eurovan and Vanagon.  There is little if any specific to the baywindow and 
split window bus.  There is loads of generic camping stuff though.

The catalogs are about the same as the '98 version, but with a few new items 
including a couple of new side tents.  The catalog is in German, but you can 
easily find your way through it with the numerous photographs.

The catalogs are $10 to US addresses, and $13 to any Canadian address.  US 
funds only with the check drawn on a US bank.  I can also accept postal money 
orders in US funds.

I am the US rep for Reimo, so I can get you just about anything in the 
catalog.  I stock some items here in the US including several models of side 
tents.

To order, visit my web pages at: &lt;A 
HREF=&quot;http://eurocampers_dot_com/&quot;&gt;EuroCampers Home Page
&lt;/A&gt; (www.eurocampers_dot_com) and follow the link to the catalogs.  If you do 
not have web access, p-mail me for ordering info.
