Paul Callender states:

&lt;&lt;  I now have 2 problems, however:
 
 1. I can't select reverse gear. I've adjusted the 
gear selector (2 bolts on  the cab floor) as per the 
Haynes manual, no matter how I try I can get 1st, 
2nd, 3rd, 4th but no reverse! Any ideas folks?  &gt;&gt;

Does it grind and not want to go in or does it feel l
ike a stone wall??  That is something is blocking
you from engaging the gear and the harder you push
the harder it pushes back??
