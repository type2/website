Dave,

Thanks for the info.

For some reason I thought I read that the oil pressure switch was near the
firewall... could this be on other engines...

Wayne,

The sensor should be the oil pressure switch.

Oh, the other wire....hmm can't remember right now, but I think it has a 
fuse on it and goes over to the drivers side of the compartment and then 
to ...hmmm...I beter let someone else answer that one, but I guarantee 
you, if it is not on there, your bus will start(almost), but then 
die....at least if it is the same as the 78 version.


THe diagrams for buses that are a little older are wonderful...somewhere 
along 75 or so, they changed the method that that used to draw them and 
they stink....maybe because things started getting much more complicated 
in later models with FI and lots of other electrical goodies.

Cheers, dave

&gt; OK, I don't know if I'm along in this, but I find these wiring diagrams
&gt; tough to read and understand - I've got a '79 Westy.  I'm not new to this
-
&gt; my Lucas electrical MG has an easier wiring diagram to understand.  I've
&gt; even figured out a buddy's old Fiat's wiring diagram and it was in
Italian.
&gt; :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, on to my question - I've been checking out and trying to
understand
&gt; the wiring in my '79 bus's engine compartment - today is the coil. as I
&gt; understand it, on one side of the coil - one wire goes to the distributor
&gt; and the other goes to F/I to as a trigger. on the other side of the coil -
&gt; one wire goes to ignition to energize the system. where does the other
wire
&gt; go on this side of the coil?
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, BTW, there is a sensor right next to the distributor (towards the
front
&gt; of the bus). what is this?
&gt; TIA,
&gt;
