Subject: Re: pop-top removal

I just took the top off my 72 this past Fall for the exact same reason.
Working on the saw horses made life easy.  The top was easy to put back on
and line up once I was ready.  The luggage rack seems to mount solid in one
place only and the pop top seems to only adjust forward and backward.  While
you have the whole thing apart, replace all the nuts, bolts, and screws with
stainless steel.  It's not that expensive and it will last forever.  I can't
speak for the canvas install though, I haven't bought a new one yet.
