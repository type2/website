When I first bought my 72 I had the same problem.  All the parts were there
and looked good, but no heat.  After a few years of driving around in the
cold I decided to pull all the duct work from under the dash.  I found that
the PO had stuffed foam rubber into all the heat ducts.  I still don't know
why, maybe he didn't like all that heat pouring into the bus when he pulled
the red lever?  After I pulled it all out, the stock heat system worked
great.  Now I just have to seal all the air leaks into the bus and it might
even keep me warm.

&gt; Heat, I am so jealous of these people talking of their wonderful heat.
&gt; We got this bus out of South Cal and it's in great shape.  The heating
&gt; system looks amazingly intact, but still heat is a whimper.
