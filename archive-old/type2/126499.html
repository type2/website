Subject: Re: [T2] Caharging problems

I'd bet money on your battery being bad.

This has happened to me more times than I can remember. The battery
can't quite get enough juice to run the vehicle and maintain charge at
the same time.

I actually put in the cheapest WalMart battery in my bus and it's
lasted since March now with no problems... Of course a good quality
battery is a better choice if you can afford it.
