&gt;It serves a very useful purpose! IT IS SUPPOSE TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF FORCE!
&gt;How close to the limit before the rears lockup is what you might want to
&gt;find out, but you always use a proportioning valve, always!!!!

I told you someone would say it...

If you must play around with
&gt;it, try an aftermarket valve from wilwood racing, its about $60 (US)

I just bought one for $43 from Summit (1-330-630-3030) for my Mustang.

&gt;I do not know if the prop valve on the VW bus is adjustable, most factory
&gt;valves are preset at the factory.

It is not adjustable, unless you count gutting it as an adjustment.

&gt;Whether or not th rears lock up has nothing to do with the amount of
&gt;weight over each wheel on your bus.

Now just a minute...

It is a matter of physics and weight
&gt;transfer.

Yes it is.  I understand these things.  I still maintain that my rear
brakes will not lock up before the fronts.  And despite what you say, it
has quite a lot to do with the amount of weight over each wheel.  You can't
figure any of the &quot;physics&quot; out without knowing the weight first.  The bus
has an IRS rear suspension (read lots of suspension travel) with a lot of
weight over it, even *behind* it.  The drums do not have nearly as much
stopping power as the discs.  That biases the braking towards the front
already.

&gt;MY 2 cents
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Now, I know there will be a few of you who will say, &quot;Don't do this!!!!
&gt;&gt; It's dangerous, the rear brakes will lock up and you'll spin out!&quot; but the
&gt;&gt; my bus has 1100 pounds over each rear wheel and even with some major weight
&gt;&gt; transfer I don't think the rears will lock up.  Ever.  One of these days
&gt;&gt; I'm gonna try it.
&gt;&gt; Or, I may put in an adjustable proportioning valve.  These are only about
&gt;&gt; $40 and have a high coolness-factor.

See?  I mentioned the adjustable proportioning valve.  Did you even read
this far?
