there is a mechanic in Natick named greg (interesting I think this might be 
the guy that left metric systems??) who runs Greg's Repair (of course!!). 
very good very busy.(508)647-9749

and there is also a VW place in Dedham who I have no experiece with but has 
been helpful, called Joe' Auto Sales and Service (I don't have the number but 
is should be in the yellow pages).
