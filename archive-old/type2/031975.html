&gt; (Where to wire the relay for an aux. battery on a '79 Westy)...

This is stock on my '78 Champagne edition Westy. The relay goes on the 
rear wall near the top of the engine compartment just inside the rear 
engine door on the driver's side. Just inboard from the left taillight 
fixture.

It's intended to run the refrigerator. My 'frig crapped out (as many do) 
and I removed it, so I have little purpose for the aux. battery except to 
jump myself as needs be. But I keep it in, with intent to someday wire a 
crossover to run lights and tunes off the aux. battery. But I'd only need 
that if camping for many days and using lots of lights, which is a very 
rare event. Or if I went and bought some power hungry appliance (maybe a 
laptop computer?). So I wonder: what are you going to do with yours?
