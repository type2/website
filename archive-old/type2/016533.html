&gt; I need a new 3/4 cylinder head for my '77 California Type 2.  I've located
&gt; (and hidden) a candidate in a local junkyard, but wanted to be sure that
&gt; it would work before I bought it. There is nothing visiably (to me) wrong
&gt; with it.  It costs $30-$40.  Several questions:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) what shoud I look for in terms of defects?

I'm relatively new at the &quot;Type 4&quot; stuff, but I understand the heads
have a tendency to crack near the exhaust valve.  And of course valves
and guides, and look for warpage, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) are the right and left sides different?  Is there a sensor on one side,
&gt; and if there is, on which side is it?
&gt; 
The left (3/4) head has the sensor, on top, near the front, just about
even with the area between the #3 valve guides.

&gt; 3) it seems to come from a '78 van.   Didn't they have hydrolic valves,
&gt; and does that effect the head.

Yes, they did have hydraulic lifters, but looking at the catalogs, the
heads are the same for non-hydraulics.
&gt; 
&gt; 4) assuming that WD-40 sprayed into the intakes doesn't leak past the
&gt; valves when closed, can I assume that the valve seats are in usable shape.
&gt; 
Probably a pretty good indicator.  My sources (Tom Wilson-- get the
book!) say you should _always_ replace exhaust valves in pre-pancake
engines, but that the sodium-filled valves on type 4 engines can go
through one rebuild, but must be replaced on the second.

&gt; 5) if it turned out that the valve guides need replacing, is that work
&gt; that a local machine shop could do (I know a local shop that specializes
&gt; in head work)?

Unless they are like a local expert shop that frowns on
&quot;non-performance&quot; stuff, they will be able to do it just fine.  Once
again, get Tom Wilson's book &quot;How to Rebuild you Volkswagen Air-cooled
Engine&quot; for all the skinny.  I just (finally) got a copy and don't know
how I managed for so long without it.
&gt; 
&gt; 6) any other advice about buying a used cylinder head?
&gt; 
Good luck.  I've never been brave enough, but the $30-$40 seems like
little enough to risk, except that a good gasket set for it will cost up
to $70 or so!
I've normally either rebuilt mine, or bought a professional rebuild.

&gt; Thanks!
&gt; 
You're welcome.
HTH, YMMV, etc.   :&lt;)
