Subject: chugging to a stall

Just when I had my &quot;stalling at stop signs&quot; problem fixed, up comes a
new one... would love some help from whoever can offer.

	Symptoms:

	Engine will slowly chug to a stall
(VRRRRRrrrrr-rrrr-rrrrr-rrr-rr-r-r-r-r-r----r-----r----r---r----stall)
with the oil/brake/battery lights slowly flickering on the dash as the
engine dies.  When it doesn't do that, it idles so badly that the whole
bus shakes.
	I can remedy this by keeping my foot ever so slightly on the gas until
about 10-15 minutes into the trip when the engine is warm.  Sometimes. 
Other times the problem persists, seemingly no matter how warm that
engine is.

	My attempts so far:

	First I thought spark... I changed the spark plug wires (#1 badly
corroded), coil (tested it, weak as hell), and distributor cap (#1
connection equally corroded).  This didn't seem to solve the problem,
but damn those spark plug wires look cool in there.

	Then air... all my tests seem to indicate that the air supply is not
plugged/deficient anywhere.

	This leaves me with fuel.  Fuel pump kicking the bucket maybe?  I'll
investigate this one over the weekend, but any other clues would be
appreciated.  BTW, can the fuel pump on 72 busses be replaced w/o
pulling the engine?  Someone say yes, please.

	When chokes are on, and engine cold, engine starts at a 1/4 turn every
time.

Thanks in advance,

Jean-François
