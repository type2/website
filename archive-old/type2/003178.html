Subject: Fw: Anyone have an auxillary air cooled on a 2 liter bus?


&gt;
&gt; &gt; My oil temps run too high for my liking in humid Charleston, SC.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If I am going 65 on the interstate, I see 110C as the temp....sometimes
as
&gt; &gt; high as 120C........oil pressure low I guess cause the oil gets so thin!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yes, I know about slowing down, even if I go 55 their is not that much
&gt; &gt; difference...maybe down to around 105c.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The vehicle is an 81 vanagon westy, and the frame is insulated with
should
&gt; &gt; deadening foam, qpads, etc....so it is heavier than a normal van.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Has anyone installed an auxiliary oil cooler, and where can I buy the
&gt; setup?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
