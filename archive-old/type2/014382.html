Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] Cheap timing light/tach-dwell meter and other tools?

&gt; Go to a pawn shop and pick up a good used Sun, SnapOn or Allen timing

&gt; Timing lights are real cheap since VW folks are the only market for them.

Stan,

If you know a pawn shop that has a Snap On timing light for $20, please
let me know the phone #!!!!  I will call right now to buy it!  A quick
search of *bay tells me the price of Snap On timing lights is closer to
$150/$200, at least if the auction is within a day of closing.  Go there
and search &quot;snap on timing light&quot;

The Sunpro would not do for a professional mechanic, for whom a busted
timing light means losing a day's pay, but for a back-yarder, it is
perfectly adequate.  I have one and have been using it for a year or two.
The pickup is held together with duct tape, as I keep busting it up, but
it tapes rather well and keeps on flashing.  When the bulb goes, I will
toss it and buy another.

&gt; Volks,
&gt;
&gt; Thomas has an excellent set of points. (and a good condensor, too :-)
&gt; Some additions:
&gt;
&gt; This is fine for a type1 engine, thru '71 in the U.S.  If you have a
&gt; type4
&gt; engine, tho, you really need a timing light.  Sunpro makes one that is
&gt; fine for our application.  A quick search on the internet turns up a post
&gt; on the Miata list (http://www.realbig_dot_com/miata/miata/1998-01/3887.html)
&gt; that sez you can get them at western auto for $29 or thereabouts.
&gt;
&gt; Second, Barry Burneskis found someone who was selling a sunpro ignition
&gt; analyzer for ~$15 that included V-O-M and dwell functions, a longtime
&gt; dream of mine!  I piggybacked on his order, so I don't know the source...
&gt; Barry?
&gt;
&gt; Third, If you have a V-O-M and don't have cash, you can set dwell using
&gt; it
&gt; as a dwell meter by setting it to low DC volts, connect the red wire to
&gt; the condensor lead on the coil, the black to the engine case or body
&gt; (ground) and then look for 6.67 volts, which translates to 50 degrees of
&gt; dwell while cranking or running.
