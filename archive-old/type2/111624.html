Subject: Slider sun roof solution

While not completed, this project is far enough
along to post a few pics.
  The slider beat me. I no longer want to deal with
fixing it but I didnt want to loose the headroom
when camping so I am converting it to a side
hinged pop top. 
  So here are some pics for those of you asked for
them.
