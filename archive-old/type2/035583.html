Subject: MPG 78 Westy

Hi, As I am getting to know my new 78 Westy I am doing the usual routine.
Fluid changes, lubing, tightning nuts and bolts, checking for potential
exhaust and oil leaks ... I have recorded the mileage of its maiden voyage
at 17.8 UK gal (21.4 US gal) for 352 miles. That is 19.8 miles per imperial
gallon or 16.4 per US gallon. I did not expect to get the kind of mileage I
came to expect from a type 1 engine but what should the mileage range be? My
engine is relatively new with only 2500 miles on it so I assume it is mostly
broken in and the valve clearances and timing should be fine. Is that normal
mileage? It was 90% highway. Runs great warm but idles rough cold so if my
mileage is below par should FI be the first place to investigate?
