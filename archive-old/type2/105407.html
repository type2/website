Two bold posts by John and Robb, going against &quot;conventional wisdom&quot;.  Having
had an oil temp gauge in my bus for... a really really long time, I am
fundamentally in agreement with them.  I think the whole issue of oil
breakdown at high temps is a little overblown.  If you don't want to hear
another long rant, please delete now.

When I bought my bus, the engine needed rebuilding almost immediately.  I
bought it from a teenager and it had a hole in one of the 96mm pistons.  Not
enough info to blame anyone for anything.  In any case, I rebuilt the engine
as an 1800cc, with new pistons/cylinders, all new bearings, etc..  First drive
on the freeway the oil temp went north of 230 and pressure below 30psi.  I was
so scared that I parked it, pulled the engine, split the case and checked all
of the bearing clearances again, thinking that I had made a big mistake.
Everything was to spec though.  Gradually the temps came down as the engine
broke in, but I still often saw 240+ on the highway.

Next engine I built was a 2.0 low-compression hydraulic.  Same story - oil
temps have always been high in the summer.  I've seen 250+ on several
occasions.  25 psi or even less at highway speeds.  Just passed 100k miles on
this engine and I've bumped the compression on it twice since it was built.
The high temps have always worried me a little, so I've run synthetic oil and
backed off the throttle in extreme conditions.

So a couple of months ago I installed an Autometer mechanical oil temp gauge
in my Mustang.  In the sump.  It does not go below 220 when idling around
town.  A few full-throttle pulls will send it to 260 in a hurry.  This in
40-degree weather!  Two of my friends have the same gauge and were reporting
outrageous oil temps - they were over 300 degrees on the track and thought
that their gauges were simply inaccurate.  Now Autometer sells a lot of gauges
and I really doubt that ALL of their oil temp gauges read way too high, but
just in case, I verified the accuracy of my gauge by dipping the sender in
boiling water (read 190, probably because it took several seconds to get the
pot of water from the stove to underneath my car... the sender does not detach
from the capillary tube!) and also by using an IR gauge, one of the gun-style
ones with a laser pointer.  My gauge said 242 and the IR gauge said 232 when
aimed at the brass fitting on the outside of the pan.  I figured that taking a
reading on the outside of the pan could easily account for a ten-degree
difference.  Regardless, it was obvious to me that the gauge was definitely
not reading significantly above the actual temperature of the oil in the
sump.

I haven't been to the track yet with this gauge, but when I think back to the
times that I have run at nearly constant full-throttle for 20 minutes at a
time in 95 degree heat, well... I don't want to think about what my oil temps
were then.  Somehow, the motor held together.  All of a sudden, 250 in the bus
doesn't seem so bad.  Yes, I know a bus is air-cooled unlike a Mustang.  I
don't think that really changes anything - the bearings must stay lubricated
and the oil appears to be able to perform that function even when it is
extremely hot.  How it got that hot is irrelevent.  If it does break down, it
isn't severe enough and/or doesn't happen fast enough to be a problem for me
most of the time.

I have to admit that I did once have a bit of bearing material exit the
crankcase in my bus via oil suspension.  The conditions were about as severe
as you could imagine - full throttle going up a long hill on a very hot day.
I would have lifted had I not basically been in fear of my life because of the
lack of a shoulder on the road, lack of a passing lane and a lot of angry
18-wheelers on my rear bumper.  It was also the first time I had used any oil
other than Mobil-1 synthetic in my engine, but that's probably coincidence.  I
was using Valvoline synthetic, 20-50.  Oil temp peaked at about 270 and
pressure was 18psi at about 3200rpm.  Despite this, I did in fact make it the
rest of the way to Busses by the Bridge 2000, and back home again.  And
another 18,000 miles, so far.

I'm still not sure what really happens to oil at 260, 280 or 300 degrees, but
I'm starting to think it is not all that bad.
