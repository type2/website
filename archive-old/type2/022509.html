Subject: Re: [T2] Bay Window rear sway bar
Mime-Version: 1.0

On my previous bus I fitted a rear sway bay, on the instructions it specificaly stated that it should not be fitted unless an uprated front sway bar is fitted first.

Although they didn't say so the implication is that making the back as stiff (or stiffer)as the front the handling would be adversly effected.

Of course you may have already fitted an uprated front sway bar in which case this warning is unnecessary.

I beleive there are a couple different fittings for rear sway bars depending on what type you have bought. They all seem to fit onto the bolts at the lower end of the rear shock absorbers and either bolt to the chassis rails or to the torsion bar tube. 

As compromising the handling of your bus could be a fatal experience for you and/or your bus I would not recommend fitting the sway bar without the detailed manufacturers instructions - from memory on the type which I had the connection between bar and lower shock absorber bolt had 12 separate parts (on each side) and you realy do want to get it right.

Good luck

&gt; When I was at the Spring meet on Washington I bought a rear anti sway bar
&gt; for my 71 Westy. I decided that I better install the darn thing before I
&gt; travel down to L.A. for the OCTO/Classic weekend. As far as I can tell it
&gt; bolts to the frame rails via supplied brackets and then the ends bolt to the
&gt; bolts which hold the spring plates on. Can anyone who has a rear bar verify
&gt; this or point me in the right direction? Any pictures would be greatly
&gt; appreciated. Also if you see Kate (11) or I in the Roadcow please stop by
&gt; and say Hi.
