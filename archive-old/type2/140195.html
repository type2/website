Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon brakes

&gt; With the cost of new wheel cylinders, shoes, and drums; this is a pricey update to self-adjusting rear
 brakes..... WAY more than the $50 it cost me in nice used parts...
 http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/134242.html

I have a suggestion for Karl about this:

What about putting kits together and selling them for $100?

Not the drums or shoes but everything else. I'm sure folks would like
that, and you'd make a bit of profit.

For that matter, you could do something similar for the 79 Cali
electronic ignition rigs!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At one time I was doing the 79 electronic ign set-ups for $75 for all the pieces.......

But the setback was the harness between the module and the dist. The 3 wire end at the dist was/is a very weak 
point. With age, the 3 wires will crack the insulation and short together. I have about a dozen dizzys but no 
harness's. And the supply is getting thin.

The prices the yards charge for parts has been climbing steadily but the bus/Vanagon inventory has been 
declining faster. Between the 3 big yards here, they were crushing an average of 10-12 buses/Vanagons a month. 
Now I am lucky to find 1 a month in any of the yards.
