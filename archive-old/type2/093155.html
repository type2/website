Subject: Re: [T2] Just a Couple of Questions


&gt;3) I want to be able to listen to the radio when the motor is off but have
&gt;read on the list that the points may weld together if they happen to be in
&gt;the wrong position.  How can I avoid this, I have a 0231 181 012
&gt;distributor.  Can I use a breakerless system in this distributor, if so is
&gt;there more than one brand and which is best and why?

Easier than that - wire it to wire that is hot when the key is off. The 
main red wire coming from the rear of the bus comes to mind. PART of your 
fuse panel is hot all the time. Move the radio power wire to one of those 
circuits.

They make a nice little piggy-back terminal that allows you to slide off a 
female spade terminal, slide on this adapter, and then you have two male 
spade terminals - one for the original female and 1 extra for anything you 
want to wire it to.

Any of your local electrical supply houses will carry this.

&gt;  4) For the first ten minutes of driving or so when I come to a stop the bus
&gt;doesn't want to idle and dies.  It starts right back up but why wont it
&gt;idle?

Carburetor or fuel injection?
