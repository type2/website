&gt;Tearing down 2.0 liter yesterday (I had to pull the heads anyway and then
could see wear on the camshaft lobes. Doh!)...found one of my pushrods had
a spot about 1/2&quot; long where it had milled itself. Okay, something in the
engine milled it; it may have been from a bent pushrod tube (maybe bent at
the inside lip), but I'm not sure.

That is from the spring retainer coming loose or being installed improperly
and rubbing on the pushrod as it reciprocates.  I've seen it many times
before.  

&gt;Anyway, like I said.._dot_camshaft wear: This engine has hydraulic lifters and
I'll assume the appropriate camshaft. It's from a '77, I think, but I don't
know for sure that the camshaft is correct for it. From what I can see
(pre-case splitting), the camshaft appears to be a little dished just
before the lobes.
&gt;
&gt;Comments, questions, concerns appreciated.

My comment is, &quot;I want a roller valve train in my VW!&quot;  :-(  Can't someone
engineer one?  Any shops out there listening?  There's a reason why cam
wear isn't a problem in modern engines and it's roller valve trains.
Doesn't take a brain surgeon to see why.
