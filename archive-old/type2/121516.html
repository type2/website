Subject: Re: [T2] Friday Topic What I learned about driving in Snow!

&gt;I've added some new
&gt;things to my Bus TO DO list: Buy one of these plug in window defrosters
&gt;I found on JC Whitney, add a Cig lighter to plug the defroster into
&gt;(does anyone know if these realy work??),

Buy a box of wooden matches. They work better. Bought one of those 
miserable little 12 volt heaters. Wouldn't clear the windshield (not even 
heat or air) and would not warm me up. I had it against my leg and it would 
not do much but give me a small warm spot on my clothes.

&gt;put in some MORE insulation in
&gt;the front, not to mention boosting and insulting the heating system.

Booster fan... $17 at the local boat store. You'll need a switch and a fuse 
also.

&gt;I'm an avid skier so these are now must do's.
&gt;Yes, VW type 2's are great on snow, but not in snow, that is if you like
&gt;seeing out the front window!!!

Had a Beetle that would make heat like none other and make it fast. I have 
been in a '78 that made GREAT heat. Today it makes so-so heat. It is a '78 
and it is imperative that the u-bend pipes are double walled. Once the 
outer wall rusts away the heater output drops substainially. Don't know if 
you have a late bus or an early bus.

Have you considered a 12v electric motorcycle vest or a 12 volt electric 
blanket? They are much easier on the alternator/generator b/c the 
motorcycles they are intended for have less electrical output than most 
cars and busses.
