&gt;So here's the run down: I have new bearings, tie
&gt;rods/ends, draglink, balljoints, sway bar rubber
&gt;mounts, new tires, new shocks and a front end
&gt;alignment.  The sound occurs at 35 mph and &quot;goes away&quot;
&gt;when faster.  The speedometer moves with the sound
&gt;(flickering with the oscilation I guess.)
&gt;
&gt;What else could it be?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks everyone!

Missy:

The clue for me to consider is the fact that the speedometer moves with the sound, so  I would say to check the speedometer cable that runs from the left front wheel up to the back of your speedometer.  If the cable wasn't screwed in all the way, or if the cotter pin at the hub end has fallen out, these could be the causes.  Or the cable could just have gone bad, or need to be greased.
