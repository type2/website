Subject: Re: [T2] VDO Tachometer wiring question.. short

&gt;I finally bought a VDO 7000 rpm tachometer and need a little help with the 
&gt;install.  All the directions make sense except for the part that shows 
&gt;wiring the tach to the fuse box.  Which fuse do I wire it to?  I think the 
&gt;accessory fuse is #9, I have to look at the manual again to make sure.
&gt;
&gt;My bus is a 78.  I know many of you have them installed, any pointers?

Find something that is &quot;hot&quot; only when the key is on.

Attach wire for tach there and include an inline fuse to be safe. It does 
not matter what the tach gets it's power from as long as it goes off with 
the key.

Good options would be the wipers and the headlight source (which goes off 
with the key).
