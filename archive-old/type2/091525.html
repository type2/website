Subject: on fuel pumps...again

On my 74 the vent line has a short length of hose
which
goes through a hole in the tin that covers the heater
box.
This is original configuration as far as I can
determine.
Question: WHY? 
Seems like a bad idea! If the diaphragm were
to rupture gas would flow through the vent hose right
on
to the heat exchanger box. ?????

2ndly.. Ron is selling &quot;new?&quot; mech. fuel pumps for
about
$100.00... anyone out there bought one and are they
German or Brazil? I didnt find a rebuild kit on his
site
tho. Maybe missed something there.

Again.. TIA
Dan
