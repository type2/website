Subject: Z bed install

I have a 79 with a country home conversion kit, that I just do not like - any 
body interested in it? I do not use the fridge (thats going to the bar on 
my back patio) nor the stove or sink.

I picked up a zbed from a 78 ( I think - the number plate was gone) at a junk 
yard. I see how to put it in my bus with one question. The z bed hardware 
connects in various places including two spots that rest on the back deck 
of the bus. It looks like a sheetmetal screw and a spacer or washers would 
do the trick. The question/problem is, I know that the gas tank and fill tube 
etc. are below this area or near below. Does anybody know how much clearance 
I have. Should I just be safe and remove the firewall btwn the engine and 
gas tank so I can see the clearance - TIA!
