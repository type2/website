Subject: Re: [T2] EGR and driving

&gt; I've also noticed that the engine seems to jerk a little when I
&gt; try to maintain speed with the pedal.  It was smooth without the EGR and now
&gt; it's just barely noticeable on rough roads but I can tell it's there.

How large is the hole in the gasket between the pipe and the valve?
It sounds like you have one of the large hole ones that goes between the pipe and filter.
The one on top of the valve has a tiny hole to partially regulate the amount of exhaust.... too much
EGR will cause your problems.
