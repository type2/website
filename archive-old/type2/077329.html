Subject: heater boxes / part question

Hey Chris,

I think what you are looking for is at cip1_dot_com and listed as &quot;heater box 
connector pipe&quot; part number for the right side is C27-071-256-052, and the 
left side is C27-071-256-051.  They are really nice vw but unfortunately 
they don't come cheap, if you buy them off of their site you can get a five 
percent discount but they are still gonna run you $85.45/piece.  I hope this 
helps.

but when I pulled the heat sheild from the bottom of the motor to continue 
following them, that metal pipe that goes from the heater boxes to the next 
metal pipe (the part exactly underneath the heat sheild) I found these two 
(on both sides, they appear to be exactly the same) pipes to be rather 
crumbly. There is not any large gaping holes in them, but I am pretty sure 
if I poked it with my finger hard enough I could punch a hole right through 
with little to no effort. If I touch them, rust/dust falls from them. In my 
tracing of this issue, this appears to be the only major weak link
