Subject: engine seal and CV boots

Hi all
        I was planning on pulling my engine today to change
the engine seal. I just read a post about a guy who did it
with out removing the engine. Is this possible or am I
dreaming. I really do not have a burning desire to pull
the motor so if I can do it with out......Hurrahhh!!!!!
        Also, I have not yet purchased a manual and I was
wondering if I will need to pull the tranny to change the CV
boots? Once agian, I sure hope not.
        I am still looking for anyone who has experience with
any particular insulation under their carpet in their bus. JC W
offers several differnet kinds and I am not sure which one 
I should get.

A quick update on what i have done so far. I pulled the interior
and found the rust is worse than I thought, but still not all
that bad. I plan on using a wire brush and my drill to scrape it
off and prep it for painting. So that is where I am at.
I hope to locate a compression tester today( borrow or rent) and
check the engine out. If the compression sucks I will be pulling her
anyway, but still not what I want to do. 

Well thanks .........Chip
