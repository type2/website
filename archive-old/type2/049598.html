Subject: Re: [T2] Tires -- Costco, Kirkland

However, that being said, I'd like to add that they have performed
adequately for myself and other WetWesties members.  I had the
'correct' Kumho six ply 'rated' 185-14s on my Vanagon GL.  They lasted
about 30k miles.  They were not 'squirmy' but they were abmysal in any
kind of percipitation.  I had LT27/8.50-14 house brand tyres on my '77
ASI.  They were wonderful tyres.  For 20k miles.  I replaced the
Vanagon tyres with Uniroyal Larados.  I replaced the ASI tyres with
Kirklands.  The handling is similar with both. (It remains to be seen
how they perform in the snow.)  The wear has yet to be determined, but
after 10k, it appears that I'll see the warranted 50k out of them. At
about a 30% savings over the Larados.

If it's a choice between a lesser price tyre and walking, the
Kirklands work for me.  If money is no object, by all means, purchase
the Michelins. 

Another alternative is Continentals available from the Tire Rack. 
However, a couple of years ago there was a fair amount of discussion
about tread seperation with them.

&gt; &gt; They are &quot;C&quot; load rating, which is what is specked by VW.  That's 1435 lbs
&gt; &gt; per tire, which is enough for a vehicle with a GVW of 5,000 lbs.  A &quot;D&quot;
&gt; &gt; rating is around 1700 lbs per tire, and I'm not sure I know of any proper
&gt; &gt; fitting tires in the &quot;D&quot; rating, other than the Michelin Agelis 61, which
&gt; &gt; doesn't seem to be available this side of the Atlantic.

&gt; Wow, 1435 lbs. is LESS than the correct size PASSENGER tire for your bus.
&gt; Right now you are looking at the wrong size tire that was recomended for
&gt; your bus by VW. If you go to page 51 of the 78 bus owners manual:
&gt; http://www.conservatory_dot_com/vw/manuals_nyx/Images/Owner-sManual/78Type2/pg51
&gt; .jpg
&gt; You will see 2 tires for your bus. Both are 185 14. Not 195/75 14.
&gt; 
&gt; A Michelin XSX 185R14C tire has a max load rating of 1710 lbs. I have not
&gt; found this tire to be available anymore.
&gt;
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; No sir, this is NOT the &quot;proper size and load rating for VW vans&quot;.  Picking
&gt; a tire because the tread looks pretty will not get it. But it is YOUR money
&gt; and YOUR bus, you can put on whatever you want. Luckily you are in Canada
&gt; and I am in Southern California and hopefully your ill-handling bus will not
&gt; run me off the road.....
