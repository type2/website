Subject: Engine modifications


This is my first posting to your site, but I have been reading for
several months.  Here is my question.  I have a 1972 westfalia pop-top,
and am about to begin it's restoration.  I want to use it as a daily
driver, so it must be reliable and fairly fuel efficient. Plus I live in

Edmonton, Alberta Canada, and I paln to do alot of camping/driving in
the rocky mountains where the hills can often be steep and long. I want
to be able to tackle these hills without causing a mile long traffic jam

or overheat.  As well the average cruise speed on our hwy's is approx.
70-75 mph on flat land and usually 50-60 mph in the mountains.  What
type of engine modifications would you suggest, or resouces to access.
I was thinking of 1.25:1 rocker arms, new carbs, 1776cc engine rebuild
and maybe a msd ignition.  I have 2 engines the original which is
currently in pieces, and a running engine that is installed and may be a

type 3 pancake engine (unsure if it is 1600 or 1700 cc).  Any
suggestions would be appreciated.
