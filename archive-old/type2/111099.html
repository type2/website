Subject: 72-73 muffler and tailpipe question 

Hello List,

I have an odd question I know that in 72-73 buses,
they used a style of muffler that had the tailpipe
comming out of the middle of the muffler. Are thse
mufflers still available? For some reason, I thought
that the mufflers were available, but I thought that
the long tailpipe that comes out of the middle was
NLA. Am I mistaken? Any how, If anyone is in the
market for one of these tailpipes for their muffler,
email me and i will give you a link to where you can
find one. There appears to be only one though. Just
thought I would pass it along.

Take care!

Regards,
David Kelly
