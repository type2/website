Look on the bright side :)

If you ski, you can wear your full slopes outfit from home to the lifts and
back and not have to worry about being too hot in the vehicle.  You can even
drive a VW bus with ski boots on.  Try that in your typical 4-door saloon...

&gt;&gt;  Before anyone can answer that question, they need to know where you
live.  I live in Connecticut.  During the winter my family would always take
coats, hats and gloves when we went for any drive over 20 minutes in the
winter.  Most of the time we would wear the coats.

This was in a well sealed 71 Westy with the outside temperature below 30
degrees.  The heater boxes make a difference but not as much as you would
like.  &lt;&lt;
