Subject: [T2] groovy pushrods

yeah.  I'm ripping apart my engine, i get the pushrods out, two have 
nice little grooves at the top.  Right where that spring clip would be 
if it didn't get put in right.  The rods were in the #2 cyl.  When I 
said little, I was under-exagerating.  They're really deep.

   So, here's some questions.  Are the grooves from the clip?  Then why 
didn't the clip wear first?  Do I need new pushrods now?  I have to buy 
the whole set, don't I?  Is there anything else I have to do for this?

   Ok then.  Happy motoring.
