Subject: Re: [T2] Friday - VW Planet sighting

&gt;&gt;BTW Since its friday, what's the longest anyone on the list has owned their
&gt;current bus(es)?
&gt;
&gt;I have had my '77 bus for 10 years this spring....my '79 for 4 years...
&gt;
&gt;Collie

me too - coming up 10 years on my 75 westfalia. never will sell. two
children since then, and they love the orange glow when the curtains are
closed, and they love the child's cot (both weigh less than 75lbs).   sure,
people drop by and ask if they can buy it. and i say, jeez, why don't you
just take my dog?    - steve
