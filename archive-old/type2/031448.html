just in this past week my 78 FI started missing at high speed under
load. (60+mph on grade)  it's slowly getting worse.  had this happen once
before and it was fuel filter, but the one in there is about 8 months old
(maybe 12k miles)  usually I change the fuel filter annually and don't
have any trouble...

haven't had a chance to crawl under and swap out the filter (I have valves
on the fuel line so it isn't a gasbath anyway) the weather is pretty wet
at the moment..... any other suggestions I might be missing, have
Pertronex installed so no points other than that pretty much stock.  have
gauges and oil presure is staying in the right place and not running any
warmer than usual.   in fact it is so subtle that no one else in the car
has been able to detect it even when pointed out, &quot;Am I one with my van or
what?&quot;

Thanks
Bob

oh, and after 8 years she finally told me her name,,,,,JOAT
