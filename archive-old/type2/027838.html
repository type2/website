&quot;So, what gets 26 year old back gunky glue off of paint,
without stripping the paint in the process?&quot;

   Almost any solvent will do this.  It depends on how much time and 
physical effort you want to put into the job.  On the slow end of the scale, 
with a lot of scraping and rubbing, would be mineral spirits.  You can get 
it odorless and it probably won't hurt the paint.  On the other end of the 
scale is Methyl Ethyl Ketone, MEK as it's know.  It's very strong and can be 
had at better hardware and paint stores.  The fumes are terrible, and you'd 
better be working with protective gloves on.  Read the safety warnings on 
the can and believe them!  On the upside, the stuff will soften that old 
glue pretty quick and you may be able to wipe it off with a rag.  But before 
long it will soften the paint too so be careful.
