&gt; Volks,

&gt; [78 Westy Deluxe]
&gt; 
&gt; I'm in the process of doing my own brakes; fronts were easy, rears have been
&gt; a whole 'nother story.  Sadly, I've not the five-fingered castellated nut
&gt; remover/puller thingy of death that Bentley says is required... and checking
&gt; Muir revealed that it's &quot;usually 36mm&quot;.... guess what?  It ain't.  'Brought
&gt; a 36mm socket home to discover it's not even close.  What is the size,
&gt; anyway?  Am I approaching this from the right angle to start with?  What
&gt; MUST I do to get those bloody hubs off so I can replace shoes and cylinders?

Everyone else's response to remove just the drum and not the hub was right
on...you only remove the hub to service the bearings. But! Measure the
castellated nut with a ruler and you should find that it's 46mm. 36mm nuts
(which you do have to remove to service the brakes, at least on a Type 1)
are found on Types 1, 3 and 4...not Type 2.

To get this off you need a 46mm (or 1 13/16&quot;, that works too) socket on a
3/4&quot; or 1&quot; drive breaker bar or impact wrench. (One-inch drive? Sears has a
one-inch drive socket set in their Craftsman catalog. It costs $800, so
unless you were a mechanic at an oil refinery you probably wouldn't need
one.)
