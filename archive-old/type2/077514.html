Subject: Re: Park links

Can we settle on a date?
If we're going to go to a Texas park there will not be any problem with
space in OCTOBER/NOVEMBER its more of making sure the park isn't closed
for winter months.
Somebody throw a dart at map.
I'm sure that there are going to be some of us left out because of
date/distance constraints.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; We camped at Buescher this summer. Nice, but a little small.
&gt; 
&gt; Kris S. Seago
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Centerville.  Does anybody know of anything near there.?
&gt; &gt; .........................There is a new State Park at Centerville 
&gt; called
&gt; &gt; Boggy Creek, It is only partially open.
&gt; &gt; If anyone is going to call the Texas Parks Department they might 
&gt; inquire.
&gt; &gt; There isn't anything to do in Centerville unless they have the 
&gt; park
&gt; &gt; opened, not even decent Barbecue close by.
&gt; &gt; ----------------------
&gt; &gt; I think we need to pick the location that will have the best 
&gt; geographic
&gt; &gt; location so we can have the best attendance IE, folks from Wet 
&gt; Westies,
&gt; &gt; Type 2 List, Vanagon List and any other list we can induce 
&gt; participants
&gt; &gt; from. Might even consider scheduling it with a fall time activity 
&gt; in one
&gt; &gt; of the nearby small towns.
&gt; &gt; I think Texas Highways Magazine list the events for most all Towns 
&gt; in
&gt; &gt; Texas.
&gt; &gt; I've just posted this to wetwesties, type2 and vanagon so if 
&gt; anybody else
&gt; &gt; is members of other lists .... lets post to those list also.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; There are only about three actual VW parts stores around Dallas 
&gt; but I'd
&gt; &gt; be willing to post a bulletin at each of them If I get a weeks 
&gt; notice. If
&gt; &gt; someone wants to commit to a date and location and E-mail me the 
&gt; 8.5 x
&gt; &gt; 11&quot; bulletin that I can run off on my supply of copies on my 
&gt; color
&gt; &gt; printer.----------------
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I personally like Lake Whitney State park because it has some wide 
&gt; open
&gt; &gt; areas for baseball, kids can ride bikes, play badminton, volley 
&gt; ball just
&gt; &gt; about anything you've got the equipment to do.
&gt; &gt; Dogs have to be on leashes so doggie frizby games may only last 
&gt; ten
&gt; &gt; minutes.
&gt; &gt; The campsites are laid out so if you have a non-westy driver 
&gt; visiting
&gt; &gt; they can pitch a tent at your site without hastles.
&gt; &gt; They also have screened cabins (four half walls with a roof) that 
&gt; we
&gt; &gt; could get one of for a community get together one night, there is 
&gt; no
&gt; &gt; general store there (never seen it open) but they do have ice at 
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; gate.
&gt; &gt; I'm not packing any dogs, wives, kids or goats so I do not need 
&gt; any
&gt; &gt; special provisions, I normally just go to Possum Kingdom above the 
&gt; dam
&gt; &gt; out on the point (roughing it is bad for dogs and kids because if 
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; tics) and get up on top of a hill and rough it with just Westy 
&gt; luxuries.
&gt; &gt; I seldom actually fish, just throw the line in and take what 
&gt; comes, if I
&gt; &gt; don't completely forget that I've got a line in. I never stay at 
&gt; Possum
&gt; &gt; Kingdom State park, its like a mobile home park, so many big motor 
&gt; homes
&gt; &gt; and big travel trailers.
&gt; &gt; At any rate the trip is normally the reward for me and not the
&gt; &gt; destination but I think we need an inventory of kids, dogs, wives 
&gt; etc to
&gt; &gt; select the best site.
&gt; &gt; Bardwell  Reservoir is dead, nothing, nothing but just the lake 
&gt; and near
&gt; &gt; Ennis (6 miles) with good Barbecue place.

&gt; &gt;&gt; from what I remember it was nice.  Bastrop and Buescher are 
&gt; really
&gt; &gt;&gt; pretty....lots of trees and water.  Did they mention anything 
&gt; about
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Buescher when they said there was a concert at Bastrop?  They 
&gt; are
&gt; &gt;&gt; next door to each other so I wonder if what Buescher's status 
&gt; is.
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; It's tough making a decision - I'm sure they're all nice.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; There may be other more centraly located parks that are county
