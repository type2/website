Stan, buy the Bosch ignition parts called for in their index for your
application. That will resolve all issues with regard to what is truly the
proper spec part. and will function as intended. Same goes for FI parts.
The beauty of using Bosch is the confidence in proper function for long
life. The problem with mix and match whoever production is noting
differences then needing to find out, &quot;Will this work anyway? Could this be
my problem? Is it important? Can it do damage?&quot; I suggest you are damaged
when you have to address these questions cause you lose time trying to sort
out a variable by buying whatever the FLAPS man put on the counter saying,
&quot;Yeah, it meets OEM specs. (Even though it has aluminum in place of copper,
or the rotor tip is 'differnt'.)
