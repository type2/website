My name is Keith jensen and I live in Lake Elsinore Calif.
 I have a very awesome bus that I need to sell. It is a 71 westy with a =
trans vair kit ....which allows you to install a 110 6 cylinder corvair =
engine and trasns axle in it. I have owend this bus for 20 years and =
swithed 10 years ago to corvair power. every thing on this bus has been =
redone.
 bottom line is the powerglide tranny leaks due to a bad torque =
converter , seal ?
  The other day I started it and it droped a valve seat, so its a whole =
drive train rebuild, the bottom end , cam and crank are fine all you =
would have to do is fix the bad head and repair the leak in the =
powerglide.
  my familly used this bus in this configuration for 10 years and is =
alot of fun to drive kicks ass on any bus.
   you can drive it in the fast lane all day.
 All I want is a 1000,00 for it .
  Alot of time and money went into the body work and paint
NO RUST !!!!! lots of new window rubber to many things to list
 sorry for not sending you the pics not (pis) but I found a couple =
recent pictures and will send to any one who requests them.
 Ed Corson built the motor and trans but we have been baffled as to why =
the powerglide keeps leaking.
 It got so bad I parked it and bought a new car.=20
   the paint is awesome , rhe whole front end was rebuilt a couple of =
years the brakes ,rotors ,calipers etc brand new.=20
Please call me at 909 678 4968 there is so much to list it would take a =
book, and if you dont want the coevair set up you can re-install the =
V.W. power drive system back in.
for what I am asking ....I am giving her away!!!!!!!!
    Thanks,  Keith ...._dot_call, e-mail me etc I do have 2 good =
pics....thanks again.       =20
