Hi All,

I received quite a bit of mail from list members when I posted the plans
for my upcoming trip out West in Casper, our 1970 VW Westfalia Bus. 
Oh Boy ! .... 1600 CC of air cooled engine with it's own tent, 
and 150 watts of RF with it's own antenna; 
all crawling down the road at a whiz bang speed of 55 MPH !

The combination of Ham Radio and Bus interests has made for a common
thread to a lot of you out there.

I hope to make a couple of VW bashes and at least one Ham Radio club
meeting that I have been told about.
The righteous ride trip should last 6-8 weeks; shooting out across TX, NM,
AZ, CA. OR, WA, ID, MT, (gets foggy from here on)

To those that E-mailed me, I will send you more info next week on what I
might expect as to route and timings, as I make my final decisions and get
closer to launch.
 
Also, thanks for the generous offers of a camp spot, cold brew, and hot
meal from the many that offered same. We'll see ......... Better to just
meet and enjoy than to impose.  

I do know one thing............... Smaller roads and Route 66 paths are
the preferred concrete.

About the only firm schedule I have at the moment is for the night of July
13th when I will be at a bar owned by the sister of a very good friend of
mine here in Houston. Supposedly, I get to drink for free. (We'll see)

Anyone interested in meeting me at ? .....................
Wayne's World
1832 South 120th, 
Seattle, WA 98168
tel # 206-433-8658 

I would expect to be there late afternoon to early evening time on the
13th.
I understand I should bring my darts.

The turbos are warming, and I am into pre-launch check ,
Bob in Houston
