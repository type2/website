Bob,
You might try Pearl White # 1594 by Plasti-Kote.* Says on the can,  for
light trucks, sport utilities, and VANS*.  Pep Boys  $4.99 a can.   Don't
know if it will be a perfect match, but should be closer than the two that
you've tried.  I once did some front end body work on a 70,  painted just
the front skin with it,  was  hard to tell the difference from the rest of
the bus......

&gt; Picked up a bottle of both and tried test spot with each.
&gt; #3300 is a tad too white
&gt; Wimbledon is a tad off by something ever so minuscule, yellow maybe??
&gt;
&gt; This search for the perfect touch up paint kind of reminds me of the
&gt; three bears and the porridge.
&gt; I can go to the automotive paint supply house here in Houston and have
&gt; a few cans made up for $$$, so guess maybe I will give that a try.
&gt;
&gt; Still searching for that perfect white (other than Dick Cheney)
