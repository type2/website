Subject: Sharing a voltmeter between two batteries

--Andy,

his interest was to keep them electrically isolated, so by running a ground directly to the battery, they would be totally, completely seperate, no matter what the double battery relay was doing, or if for some reason failed, shorted, whatever, as you mentioned at the end of your post.

and if you're already, running wires from both batteries to the front and installing a new switch anyway, no, it isn't that much more work/cost, and it gives a truer reading of the batteries, not derated in any way by excessive resistance/poor connections thru the bus ground, as a good gauge should.

I work for an electrical engineer, and we overengineer for safety/accuracy. That's where I'm coming from.

but...

you're right, you could do it.

Good point about the fuse as well. Put it somewhere easily accessible.

&gt;Wow isnt that a bit overly complex.
&gt;they will have a common ground, the chassis.
&gt;Just run a wire from each voltage source, or 2 individual wires &gt;right back to the batteries if you like and hook up to a spdt &gt;switch.
&gt;you should probably make sure that the switch is &quot;break before make&quot;
&gt;this means it will disconnect the first source before connectiong &gt;the second. this will prevent the batteries from trying to charge &gt;one another through your gauge wiring,  possibly with some &gt;unwelcomed fireworks.
&gt;if you run individual wires back to the batteries you probably &gt;would be safer to fuse them at the battery end just in case of a &gt;short. any sort of fuse would probably be fine anywhere from maybe &gt;1a to 10a. just so it sould blow rather than frying the wire.
