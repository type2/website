Subject: Re: [T2] Electrical mystery

A little FYI on this......
99 out of 100 Kragens/Shmucks/PepBoys or whatever
store that does free testing does not have a clue
about how a Bosch alternator works. In addition to the
3 neg and 3 pos diodes, Bosch has 3 additional diodes.

In simple words:
The additional 3 are used to send the trigger signal
to the regulator. This tells the regulator how much
field voltage to send back to the alternator. The
amount of field voltage controls the amp output. 
When 99 out of 100 bench test the alternator, they
apply full field and the alternator puts out fine so
they say &quot;its good&quot;. You get home and it still is bad
so you throw more parts at it. Probably nothing wrong
with the parts you threw at it! If those other 3
diodes are bad, you do not get output.
