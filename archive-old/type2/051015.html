Hmmm, now you have me wondering, I modified the twin squirrel cage blowers
from an underdash A/C unit to boost my heat system, I have not been
overly satisfied with the unit, and had been considering the inline
blowers from BoatUSA.....the only thing is that it says not to use with
gas heaters, and I have a BA-4 installed,  sort of figured there would be
no problem if I put it in the line BEFORE the gas heater......??????
