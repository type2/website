Subject: Re: [T2] Brakes!!  Pad, Shoes, Wheel Cylinders

Mark,

You biggest problem is going to be getting the rear nuts off the axels
unless you already have the right stuff now.  

Grab your bentley and start there.  You are probably in for about 2 days
worth of work fighting thru
the frozen nuts and bolts before you are finished.

Not to rain on your parade, but to add a little realism&lt;sigh&gt;.

Cheers and good luck, dave

&gt; Hey Everybody,
&gt; 
&gt; The bus runs great, has plenty of power.  After
&gt; troubleshooting and fixing FI, I am now a believer in
&gt; it's superiority over carbs.  I also got a reman
&gt; alternator from a local rebuilder - $57 w/ a
&gt; warranty!!
&gt; 
&gt; Anyways,  The rear right wheel cylinder leaks pretty
&gt; bad, a quart in a week and a half.  I am going to
&gt; replace it tonight.  Since I see brake fluid on the
&gt; front of the wheel and tire (facing out) I am sure
&gt; that the shoes are ruined too.  Here is my question,
&gt; while I have done rears and cylinders on my other cars
&gt; (brat, F.O.R.D. etc) I have never done it on the 78
&gt; Bus.  Any secrets, or straight forward?  Bleeding
&gt; secrets?  Oh Yeah, gonna replace front pads while I am
&gt; at it too. (sat for 6 years)  Secrets for that?
&gt; Anything to look out for?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks everybody for all the great advice.
&gt; 
&gt; Kindest Regards,
&gt;
