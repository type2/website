I'll look at Doonsebury more closely, but there is a newspaper comic called
&quot;Zitz&quot; where two kids (14-15) who's Dad let them buy a van after he found
out it had no engine. It's parked in the back yard and they lay in it and
look through the sunroof and dream of the day they can hit the road.
Recently I realized, it's a split.
