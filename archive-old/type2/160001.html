Hey ??? browndog??     You should be sure it is on TDC  as the piston can be 
at the top and not be on TDC. There are a number of ways to  find TDC you can 
either go by the exhust valve or intake .  I prefer the  intake.  Take the 
valve cover off of the #1,2 side which is the right side  as you look at the 
engine  rotate the engine clockwise and watch the # 1  intake valve  which is the 
back most cly. and second valve on the inside.  When it goes in continue to 
rotate the engine till the valve comes back up ,  continue to rotate the engine 
till the timing ,mark on the pulley lines up with  the zero on the toiming 
scale.  This is TDC. Now rotate the dizzy till the  rotor is pointing towards the 
notch on the edge of the dizzy. Now line up the  wires as Ray said. firing 
order is 1,4 ,3,2  and rotor goes clockwise. Now  the reason for setting the 
dizzy at the notch is so that the next poor SOB that  goes in there knows 
whereTDC is.  later and have fun  Mark  Dearing
