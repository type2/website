Subject: Go west, young man

All,

I will be travelling from Austin to Cupertino Calif. (San Jose area for the
geographically challanged ;-) next week for a few days.  I will be arriving
wednesday 9/23, and have plans that night, but if any one is interested I
would like to get together, and drink some beer, soda, eat food, etc.
either thursday or friday night.  Saturday morning I have to catch a flight
back to Austin, alas no VW for this trip.

Let me know. 

Cheers,

David
