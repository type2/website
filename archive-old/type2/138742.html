Subject: Culinder #3 too far from dash! CHT guage Questions.

Spent the last three days working towards putting my new engine back into the
80 Westy. All is going well with this AVP rebuild so far.

Today I did some measuring in anticipation of installing a CHT guage. It seem
the Vanagon is a little longer than a bay window bus and the gas heater
underneath causes the only possible route from the engine bay to the dash to
exceed 15 feet. : (  It seems the max length of the sensor lead is 15ft. for
all mfgrs. I have found so far.

Questions:
1. Does anyone know of a CHT sensor/guage That works on a different premise
than the thermocouple that most mfgrs use for automotive applications?. Some
way to go more than 15 ft and still be in calibration?

2. WHat happens if the lead is extended beyond the prescribed length? Does the
reading go up or down? Will the guage still work in a linear fashion?

Suggestion:
Per the previous thread about non-temp compensated CHT guages; check this out.

This is a temp compensated guage that is lower in cost than most used in our
busses.
