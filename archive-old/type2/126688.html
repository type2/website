&gt; Anyway the question is this : when removing the distributor (complete)
&gt; out of my old 2 liter fi do i have to move the motor to the timing

&gt; 1 or whatever? Or can i simply loosen that one 13mm bolt facing 
&gt; straight
&gt; up to the ceiling and the distrib should pull out? right?

You can just pull it out, yes.  I have had my distributor out countless 
times, and never set the position of the engine.  My Bus still runs, so 
I guess the approach worked :-)

You can't put the distributor in the wrong way (keyed drive, plus the 
vacuum can limits how far you can twist it around), and there is 
nothing preventing it from coming out once the clamp is loosened.

&gt; I wish the books would have a picture of the bolt im needing to loosen.
&gt; I was thinking maybe the timing mark was simply referred to so you 
&gt; could
&gt; stick the distributor back on easy.

That 13mm nut is actually a PITA to deal with because the vacuum can is 
kind of in the way, esp the bigger can used by the dual-vacuum 
distributors.  You'll probably have to loosen the clamp using the 10mm 
long clamp nut, turn the distributor to gain access to the 13mm nut, 
and possibly unscrew the vacuum can and wiggle it out of the way enough 
to get a socket on the 13mm.  Or, just loosen the 10mm clamp nut enough 
to pull the distributor shaft through the clamp (you might have to pry 
it apart with a screwdriver to actually loosen it after backing off the 
nut), and take the clamp off after.
