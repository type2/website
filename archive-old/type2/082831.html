&gt; Just noticing that Agilis 61 has a load rating of

&gt;  It's the tire pressure that carries the load,
&gt; right?  So lower pressure equals lower load.
&gt; Most of the other &quot;C&quot; rated tires have 1450-1500
&gt; psi at 50 psi load ratings.

The pressure specified by VW is that which will give best handling and
wear on the stock size tires.  If you go to a different size tire, you
need to figure out the correct pressure to carry the specific wheel load
on that tire.  If you don't you will likely get unusual wear or odd
handling.
