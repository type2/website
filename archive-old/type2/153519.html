Subject: Clutch Cable

I used to shift the &quot;Big&quot; 18 wheelers, like Kenworth, without the clutch, by
putting two fingers, very lightly, on the shift knob, and &quot;waiting&quot; for the
trans, to tell me when to shift, and I do the same with the Westy, which
prolly tells me why they have a &quot;skinny&quot; shift stick, rather than the one you
find on an &quot;m-22&quot; Muncie!

Ps Drove an Austin Healey 3000 Mk1, with a chev V/8 for two thousand miles
across parts of Canada, awesome, when the stock overdrive is engaged in 4th,
and every speck of debris, is being sucked out into the &quot;airstream&quot;, as you do
100 plus, at 1800RPM, on a &quot;break in&quot; motor phase!
