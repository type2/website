Subject: Supplemental Blower probs pt.2

Problem: Supplemental blower fan won't work.

The ground connection under the dash seems solid. I'm getting power to the 
relay in the back (per my handy test light). I'm also getting power passed 
the relay which eliminates the &quot;bad relay&quot; theory. I also tried to hardwire 
the fan straight to the battery just to see if the fan motor would work at 
all. It didn't kick the fan on which means the blower motor is shot 
(right?). Where can I get a new blower motor? If a list member wants to get 
rid of one that would work on my 79', please p-mail.
