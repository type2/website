Hi Brian,

I just deciphered my M-plate with help from the German busclub Ig-T2. They
have the same resources as you mentioned from Vincent Molenaar but the Ig-T2
solved an unknown code for me. Vincent has a great list of M-codes and he
has given his information to both Type2_dot_com and the German club Ig-T2.

The L-codes are not only Splitty codes. They come back in the Baywindow
busses too.

You can find the colour codes on a grey or silver sticker behind the drivers
seat near the M-plate. This is where the L code should be. Maybe it is gone
or damaged as it was by my 1972 bus. I just had the code L90 left and the
rest was gone. But you can find out the colour codes via the M-plate too.

Some helpfull links: http://sites_dot_netscape_dot_net/molenari/t2colors.html and
http://www.loam_dot_org/vw/Type2/PaintCodes/


If you have a mysterious code please state the code and I will try to find
out. Or ask Vincent Molenaar at molenari_at_hotmail_dot_com

Subject: [T2] Deciphering my M plate


&gt; Hi all
&gt;    I am in the midst of trying to decipher my M plate.
&gt;   But is there a way to get the paint codes out of the
&gt; other numbers?  My bus is currently the wrong color, an odd grey that VW
&gt; didn't even offer.  Also, the interior is 2 different shades of blue. The
&gt; roof may be the only original paint on this thing- that is white.
&gt;     I have tried several resources, they all give me &quot;L&quot; numbers for paint
&gt; codes to look up- Is there another plate that I need to look at? I think
the
&gt; &quot;L&quot; numbers were for splitties?
&gt;     Anyone know of a site or book with the Bay paint codes otherwise?
&gt;    FWIW- the dechipering I have done so far came from the type2_dot_com site,
as
&gt; well as the book  &quot;The Original VW Bus&quot; by Laurence Meredith.   Both good
&gt; resources.
&gt;
&gt;    Thanks
&gt;   Brian
