This may seem harsh - Okay - if you don't want to make
the either/or commitment to use whatever resources you
can to get the drum off and fix the problem NOW with
the chance that you may not be able to drive it for a
few days while repairing / replacing parts... Just
keep driving until the brakes will barely stop or slow
the bus, then the shoes will likely be worn down
enough to clear the ridge. 

{You're on east coast, right?}

If you have that much corrosion problem - are you sure
your parking brake mechanism is fully released?

Years ago I pulled my badly rusted adjusters out and
cleaned them on a wire brush wheel until shiny. I
coated all the surfaces with anti seize compound and
screwed them in and out by hand over and over until I
was confidant they would work smoothly. Clean off
excess lubricant. Discard parts that you cannot make
work smoothly. The anti-seize compound really works
well. -BaH
