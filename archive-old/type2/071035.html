Okay folks the time has come, I'm in the process of selling my house and 
relocating. After agonizing I've decided the 69 westy has to go. This could 
be a real cool ride, it's a bench seat, has M codes for the ambulence fans 
and a gas heater (of course missing) has a full length complete belly pan not 
just the outriggers, has the small popyop, no engine or trans. I really want 
to save this from the junkyard, $100 bucks to a good home. Also have 
Icebox/sink combo from a walkthru $75
thanks all
Chuck
