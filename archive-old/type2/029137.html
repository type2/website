I have a small leak at the front of my transmission, usually a drop or two
around the carrier bolts. I can find no fluid around the front shift
housing, only around the bellows.

Would it be the Bushing with oil seal Fig.7-2 pg.6-26 in the Bentley book
that I need to replace? Is this available?

Thanks

Meredith
