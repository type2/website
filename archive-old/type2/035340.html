Subject: Re: Leaking brake fluid

Seth writ:

&gt;I'm losing brake fluid on my '69.
&gt;I replaced the master cylinder last month. It's the
&gt;one that has a secondary plastic reservoir on top of
&gt;the master cylinder and a primary reservoir under the
&gt;dash.
&gt;It appears to be leaking around the seals where the
&gt;secondary reservoir goes into the cylinder.
&gt;Has anyone else had this problem? How did you deal
&gt;with it.

I had a similar problem last year on my '69.

After buying a rebuilt '69 OYO m/c for $25 at Advance Auto (GREAT DEAL!  New
is $125 up) I had problems on the install.  The bulk of these problems
revolved around the fact that fluid was leaking from both of the switches
and spraying back onto the m/c itself, making it look like the reservoir was
leaking.  I finally replaced the switches and went on my merry way, nary a
leak to be found.  I did however have to install a little Threadlok 242
(red) on the buggers to keep them from leaking.  Small price to pay, and
everything works well a year hence.

If it really is the reservoir seals, I'd try lubing them up with a little
fluid before installing them (to ensure good seal) and checking the
connecting hoses above.  They are prone to cracking with age and can also
simulate a leaking lower reservoir.

Good luck,
