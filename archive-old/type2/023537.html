Subject: RE: Rocker problems on rebuild

Joe,

Setting up the rocker geometry is not an unusual thing
to have to do on a 'new' engine.  Basically the requirement
is that rocker foot sits in the middle of the valve stem with the
cam at half-lift.  This reduces valve train wear and allows the
valve stem to rotate in normal operation. As you can appreciate,
a too long push rod means the rocker is rotated to far down
and thus is not centered on the valve stem, rather on the edge...

Hopefully, the valve stems are of equal height.  Shorten your
pushrods to get the above situation.  You can gauge lift 'by
eye' or measure with a dial guage (better).

&gt; Clueless Joe here, making headway on his inaugural engine rebuild 
&gt; but running headlong into another snag.
&gt; 
&gt; Reassembling the rocker shafts to the head, using new adjuster 
&gt; screws since the old ones were a bit uneven, but I find that #1 
&gt; Exhaust rocker -- even with the screw back all the way out -- never 
&gt; comes completely off the valve stem.  Zero lash.
