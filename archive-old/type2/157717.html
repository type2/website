&gt; I'll revise; a typical Exhaust Gas Return (EGR) sends un-burnt fuel back
&gt; into the intake manifold to be re-burned

Nope, the amount of exhaust gas returned is tiny compared to the amount of
exhaust gas available.  It's not recycling unburned hydrocarbons, because
even on the dirtiest cars the HC level is only a few percent.

The reason some engines use EGR is that the introduction of the relatively
inert exhaust gas reduces combustion temperatures, which retards knocking
and lowers NOx emmission levels.
