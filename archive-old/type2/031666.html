lots of luck, let me know if you find one

&gt;          2) buy a used one

same answer

&gt;          3) spend 3 gruelling hours in a junkyard for one

probably your best bet

&gt;          4) rebuild my current one

this is what I did, next time I hit the junkyards. but if you are
interested,  I made a fixture to hold that bugger in place, then &quot;cast&quot; it
in place using Devcon and steelwool (not with soap) as a filler, used a
sunlamp to cure the Devcon..it took several hours and two days to cure but
(knock on wood) it has held up for better than 5 years so far. BUT one
time I saw a good one in the junk yard and grabbed it for when it fails..

good luck

BTW - Devcon is a commercial metalic epoxy used for tooling casting molds
and prototypes, it is toxic stuff and takes training to get comfortable
with it.  (I used it for many years at work) and it is outragously
expensive.  (about $50 a pint)
