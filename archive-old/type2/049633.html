Greetings, all!

When we got our 76 high-top Westy last spring, it had some $100/4 tires
type of thing on it. Because the high-top raises the center of balance, and
also significantly increases wind resistance, we decided to go with a
little bit of load overkill, and replaced them with Cooper SRM II Radial LT
185R14C, which are D rated with a maximum load of 1875/tire. In June, we
drove them from Wisconsin to Yellowstone through the Badlands, Black Hills,
and via Tensleep Pass in WY, and the tires handled incredibly well. The
ride was stiff, yet they were gentler over bumps than the old, cheap,
inadequate tires. We ended up spending about $80/tire, including mounting,
balancing, and old tire disposal. I don't know about their durability, but
I believe they'll last a long time. I certainly felt secure snaking around
the sharp turns down Tensleep Pass in the Bighorns (a really beautiful
road), even in very thick and wet fog, with a wet road, and Sylvan Pass in
Yellowstone (ditto). We had to special-order them from our local Cooper
dealer, but it only took about a week to get them. Based on our experience
thus far, I recommend these tires, and would not hesitate ordering them
again.
