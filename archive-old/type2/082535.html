Subject: FS- 79 Westy (not mine!)

Eyeballed a 79 Westy for sale in Gainesville FL
yesterday.  Thought I would post to the list just
in case.  It is a pea green 79 with all the
goodies present.  No apparent rust except the
battery box.  It was dark and I didn't crawl
underneath.  Add says rebuilt engine but recent
bodywork to nose and camper top (front end
crash?).  Anyway, the guys thinks its worth $7000
and can be reached at 352-336-5838 and
552-256-9680.  Call him, 'coz that's all I know.
