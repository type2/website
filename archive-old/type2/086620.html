Subject: Re: [T2] Seat belts for kids in a bus

--=_alternative 0070DCFC85256BC1_=

&gt;&gt;I'm thinking about this as I reconstruct my '79 deluxe sunroof. I'm 
&gt;&gt;thinking about 3 points for the middle seat, and I'm thinking some kind 
of 
&gt;&gt;bolt thru arrangement at the floor in two places (pipe flange or 
&gt;&gt;unistrut), two risers (pipe or strut) and a crosspiece on which to mount 

&gt;&gt;the shoulder harness.

&gt;Maybe you could bolt a removeable cross-brace between the upper seatbelt 
&gt;anchors on each side of the bus?  Harnesses could be floor-mounted and go 

&gt;over the bar.

I hadn't thought of this since both of my kids are still in full car 
seats, but my wife just mentioned my son is getting too big for his and we 
should look at booster seats. 
SO I'm reading these posts with great interest and thinking about how I'm 
going to do this in the backseat of my 78 camper(looking forward to seeing 
anyones solution). One idea that occured to me is the Volvo 240 station 
wagons had 3 point belts in the back and they had the upper point mounted 
on a bar that mounted across the back side window (I'm picturing my aunt's 
old Volvo in my head as I type this). Seems like if these bars are rated 
for this application, given that you could mount them appropriately in the 
bus, they could be a solution.

You can make out the arrangement in these pictures if you look at the back 
window

I don't know what you would do for the middle seat passenger side tho.

PS We have one car (VW Golf) with the ratchet setup and it works great, 
just put a knee in the seat as you take up the slack. The other car 
(Escort Wagon, soon to be replaced with a Jetta Wagon TDI, unless of 
course another mfr comes out with a small wagon that gets 49MPG) we use 
the clips in and the clips stay on the seatbelts all the time.
