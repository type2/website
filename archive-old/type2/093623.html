Hi all,=20

I did a generator to alternator swap on my engine and am now trying to =
figure out where my wires go. On my alternator I've got only two =
connections, a screw type post and a male spade connector. According to =
my information and understanding, this means an alternator with a built =
in regulator???=20

As for connections, the post connection appears to be a no brainer. I =
hook that up to my red wire to the starter (and then back to the =
battery). Which wire(s) do I hook to the spade connector? Am I missing =
anything? (Yes, I've looked in Bentley and on archives but I don't see =
my solution there....)

The engine wiring on this bus is a real hack job from the start and it =
isn't possible as it is to even find the original DC regular wiring so =
I'm really out there havin' fun right now. :-(   All advice appreciated.

TIA,

John B.
