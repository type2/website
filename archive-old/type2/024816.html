Subject: And the answer is?????

--part1_92.19007acc.28ab4b5c_boundary

The question is....I have a 74 bus with two stripped, damaged lug bolts on 
the rear driver side.  What can I do to get them off...
I have tried WD-40, I tried using a 19mm socket, I purchased a 4 ft. piece of 
galvanized steel to add weight and leverage, I have tried hitting it with a 
hammer....I went out and purchased a 2 lb hammer, As a last resort I have 
taken to trying to chisel the bolts off....NOTHING IS WORKING!!!!!!

I admit it's my fault, I had it on a certificate of non-op for 3 years.... I 
ignored it while my cadi was running great....Now I have to resort to my 
&quot;buggie&quot; and I can't get anywhere!!!!  Is it revenge of the neglected bus???  

Is there any help to be found????
