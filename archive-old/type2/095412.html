Subject: Beetle advice (but a general electrical question)

Hi list, can you offer suggestions:

Sande's '71 Super Beetle has developed turn signal woes. When the ignition 
is switched on, the green turn signal arrow on the dash comes on solid, 
full-time until the ignition is switched off. The turn signals no longer 
work at all, and the switch produces no change in the dash light either.

Switch, wiring, or relay?

Thank you,
Mick McQuilton
