&gt; Unless you have a $300+ timing light static timing is the way to go. A cheap

&gt; more.

I've never heard of or experienced this sort of delay.  It would be easy
to check for though.  After the timing is &quot;all in&quot; at, say 2500RPM, If you
were to rev the engine to 5000 you would see an variation of a couple of
degrees even though the distributor couldn't change its advance.

I don't think I'll be tossing my old Heathkit timing light, though.
