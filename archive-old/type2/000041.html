Thanks to all the people that have helped me thus far,
  I wated to relay a little story ad get some feedback. My manual talked 
about laying all pieces out o a clean surface which I did ad eve took it a 
step farther to get anice piece of carpet to work off of.  I got my crank 
installed and a;ll neccessary stufff and buttoned her up torqued my 6 m10's 
to 25 #s and then tippeped my case up to start the other bolts and noticed I 
had sealed the carpet in the bottom of the case. A ssome of you remember Im 
the one that couldnt get the case apart in the first place and now I ve got 
to do it again. It came apart rather easily this time, I added some more 
permetex where I pulled the carpet out ad back together it went.  The moral 
of the story:  Theres got to be one.

  Also and the questio I had (my N button does not work too well!); when I 
was looking at my stuck carpet i noticed the oil sump was jammed and 
evidently i did ot get the bracket lined up in the case ad I have no idea 
what I could have pinched in that process. I did get it straight after the  
carpet incident and the bolt that mounts thru the case to the sump tightened 
up fine. Im woderig though could I have smashed the tube that picks up the 
oil up at the sump and delivers to the pump or whereeveer it goes from the 
bottom of the sump. Im guessing I just pinched the fitting the bolt goes thru 
ad could have damaged that and/or  left some scrapped off aluminum in the 
case. HAs ayone had this experiece? I kow if someone did what I did with the 
carpet, they wouldnt tell that story, so I ll assume no oes done that.

   THanks ,,
