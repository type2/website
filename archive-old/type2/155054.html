Subject: Whistling Bus - The new guy finally fixed his own bus

I emailed last weekend about my bus that wouldn't stay running and whistling, well I fixed it.

Part 1 - I did this little false start, clicked the key and made the engine stutter as I started it, it coughed, whistled, and died.

Part 2 - my engine compartment has been a mysterious place for me, I have relied on my bus for transportation so I have paid a shop to fix it a few times in the last 8 months I have had it, although I did replace the oil cooler immediatly after buying it, besides needing it repaired quickly my shop has been a disaster, the money I have spent on repairs motivated me to work on my shop so it is useful.

Part 3 - I haven't been a gearhead for 10 years, I haven't touched points for almost 14 years, and even though I knew I had a vacuum leak after an hour of staring at my engine I tore into the distributor looking for something in there to blame, I replaced the cap rotor and points, this left my bus running horrible and it could barely move itself, I printed out the Ratwell simple vacuum line drawing and started tugging on vacuum lines, I found that the brake booster line was off but laying in a way that hid it visually, especially for a guy that thinks his engine compartment is a black hole, it didn't make it run any better.

Part 4 - So I had an opportunity to borrow a car for over a week, I took a deep breath and set aside some time for the weekend, I borrowed a timing light, I found my old dwell meter.  The first problem was that the plug wires were really screwed up, the firing order was so bad that it is a wonder that it would start at all, the number 1 wire on the distributor was not where the book said it should be so it took me some time to get this straightened out, but it sure did run nice now, I checked the idle speed, perfect, I checked the dwell, perfect, the timing was off by about 3 degrees, set that, reviewed my vacuum lines for any problems, and it runs awesome now, I finally fixed my own bus, I still have it, I had just put it down somewhere and had trouble finding it, I have inspired myself, I feel like fixing everything now.

Thanks to everyone that gave me advice
