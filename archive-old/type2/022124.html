Subject: Full flow system on new engine??
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hello everybody!

After looking through he archives I still have a few questions before I
rebuild the 2.0 engine in my 77 westy.  It still runs great after 140,000
miles but burns a little oil and has never had a valve job.

  In my 66 bus I built a new, balanced, ported and polished 1776.  With all
the money I put into parts and machine work and time I put into it I went
the extra mile and full flowed the case with a Mesa external cooler that
opens at 170 and an electric fan that kicks on at 180.  I also installed a
Gene Berg oil pump and a sump. After all this and just over 5 quarts of oil
(I get a nice 50 psi on the freeway) It runs at just under 190 on even the
hottest of days.

What I would like to know from you guys is:

Is it very beneficial to full flow the 2.0 case?
Who makes a good oil pump for the 2.0 case?
Is it a good idea to use an oil sump on a 2.0 case?

Thanks for any info,
Harry
