&gt; Results of the test:
&gt;              Idle                       2500RPM
&gt;         Limit    Reading  result    Limit    Reading  Result
&gt; HC ppm   600      1961    Fail       600      161     Pass

Misfiring, too rich. At idle.

&gt; CO %     6.00     8.32    Fail       6.00     6.11    Fail

WAY too rich. At idle and 2500.

&gt; Now, the main querstion is &quot;What's wrong???&quot;  I *think* it is running rich
&gt; as all get out (but see the last paragraph).  I can twist the AFM's tail
&gt; to lean it a bit, but I have a feeling that one cylinder is not firing too
&gt; well.
&gt;
&gt; So far I have set the dwell and timing, and cleaned up some vac leaks.
&gt; Also set the idle speed and checked compression (which is fine)
&gt;
&gt; I just got my intake boots and will install them and the new runner to
&gt; head gaskets today.  I then intend to replace the spark plug wires, spark
&gt; plugs (to take care of any possible failure in the wires/plugs).  What
&gt; else?  I can check and adjust the AFM a bit, but I don't think I will get
&gt; a 2/3rd reduction in HC at idle with only that.
&gt;
&gt; Also, what the heck are the HC and CO measuring?  HC is hydrocarbons,
&gt; which is unburned gas and says I am running rich, but CO is carbon
&gt; monoxide, which would seem to indicate that I need more oxygen i.e. I am
&gt; running too lean.

HC is unburned fuel. You have that correct. Too high = too rich if CO is
high or misfiring if CO is low.

CO is burned fuel. You are NOT too lean, you are TOO rich. You need to lean
it down or lower your fuel pressure or replace your wornout injectors.... As
injectors wear, the pintles pound into the seat, making the point taper
grooved. Like a carb idle screw if you tighten it too tight. The ECU tells
the injector how long to stay open but it can't tell it how much to inject.
New it injects X amount of fuel per millisecond, worn it will inject maybe
twice as much for the same millisecond duration.

What is your compression?

What is your fuel pressure at idle?

What is your timing at idle?

Will Virginia allow you to add a catalytic converter??
