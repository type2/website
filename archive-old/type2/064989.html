Dear Kath,

If you get a little website up and running to showcase the
virtues of Her Majesty the Bitchin' Sano Miracle Resto Bus
Restored By A Goddess, That Makes People Happy, I will 
include a link to your URL from my little VW page. 

With pride.

Don't worry about the Hot VW's and Silicone Mammaries guys. They're
a pretty pathetic bunch of wannabe's really. If they had any talent,
they'd work for a real mag.

Compared with the task of restoring a bus, writing HTML is a breeze.
Go for it.

Respectfully,
Surfer Bob
