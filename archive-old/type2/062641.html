Subject: Busses in The Netherlands? And a dilemma.

Hello,

Here is another lurker, emerging because he needs you! I am looking
around for a nice seventies bus here in the Netherlands. My current
mode of 4 wheeled transport, a Peugeot sedan, is rapidly dying, and
the Volvo in my sig will not be ready this century (I am afraid).

Now I decided that live isn't complete without a VW bus, I am searching
in the papers and magazines, but can't find anything. Does somebody
know where all the seventies busses are for Sale in The Netherlands?

Sometimes I see a camper for sale. But I do not think that I want
a camper. In my humble opinion camping is a lightwheight afair in
a tent, with your elbows in the mud (or the snow). But maybe I can
convert the car-hollidays to camper hollidays and reserve the tent
for bicycle-walking-skiing hollidays?

Is it easy to convert a camper to a normal bus?

Thanks for all the advice in advance, Kees.
