&gt;&gt;Hello from Atlanta.  I need to replace connectors on my cable--thermo time
&gt;&gt;switch and cold start valve ones have cracked--FLAPS said they are not
&gt;&gt;available except through vw dealer, Bus Depot has neither connectors or
&gt;&gt;complete cable with all connectors.  Questions:  Is this dealer only item?
&gt;&gt;Where can I find replacement of connectors or entire unit?  Thanks!

If you don't mind waiting a week to 10 days, I can supply these 2 pin
connectors at around $6 each in small quantity. I can also supply Geunine
Bosch Germany kits with numerous fittings and spec terminals. I would have
to check for a listing of the many components and cost. The spec terminal
release tools are in the kits and I would suspect available as well
singlely. The kits would  special order/warehouse only availability, except
for specialty shops like me who will not compromise the quality of function
inherent in the 'real deal'. My jobber typically has all the components
available singlely one day from me. 

All boots, terminals, housings are available for 2 through 7 gang
interfaces. D-jet, K-jet, Motronic kits are available. 

I also have available the Hella chassis wiring terminal kits with the high
spec German fittings. Definatly not the $19.95 reduced to $9.95 cheese kits
you see on the Whitney and Harbor Freight loss leader inserts.
