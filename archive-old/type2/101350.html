Subject: Re: [T2] Supplemental blower in 79' Westy not working

&gt;Jared, the relay on the fan may have gone bad.  Also, is your alternator 
&gt;working?.  The fan won't work unless the alternator is charging while the 
&gt;motor is running.  If it's not the relay, it may be the little grounding 
&gt;switch under the dash when you pull the right hand red lever down.  By 
&gt;pulling that lever down, it completes a grounding connection which makes 
&gt;it all work.  good luck, greg
&gt;

&gt;&gt;Does anyone happen to know if the supplemental blower in a 79' is on it's 
&gt;&gt;own circuit or what, if anything, shares the circuit with it?

Greg's right. As I understand it the relay gets 12 volts when the key on. 
There may be a fuse there near the blower relay (mine has one anyhow). The 
lever up front grounds the relay and the relay closes. This allows the 12 
volts to go to the blower.

www.partsexpress_dot_com has the relays for about $2 and Radio Shack has them 
for about $6. That is for a generic relay. Dunno if that will plug right in.
