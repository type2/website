I had a 75 rabbit too.  When the accel cable broke, I fixed the pedal return 
at the same time as I fixed the cable, with a spring.

I ended up trading that car for some lawn work.
The floor pans were very, very rusted through.  I was always afraid the seat would
fall thru the floor onto the highway (killing me of course)
It was a red rabbit.  One day I was riding my bicycle home from work (I had a 75 rabbit
remember?) and passed a gas station that had a blue 75 rabbit, that had been hammered, 
and primed, and one coat of blue primer.  It was all in pieces and had no wiring harness.
Guy took $100 and gave me the title.  I drove that sucker home, took the fenders off,
and from then on I had blue fenders, and I had interior panels!

If I would have had any sense, I coulda had an air conditioned blue rabbit without rust.

I did not learn the true spirit of VW until later. &lt;sigh&gt;
