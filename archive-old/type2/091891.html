Subject: Re: [T2] Bus on vacation

You mean they don't look behind the round access panel next to the MPC
&quot;brain&quot;, or behind that little panel sitting in front of the water pump,
or the panel in the sink cabinet hiding the plumbing, or the nifty space
under the fridge, or those great hollow spaces between the interior side
panels and the outer body, or all that space above the front arch panel,
or behind the kick panels, or even around the gas tank??  ( - 8

  Anyway, i've learned some things about
&gt; customs officials.  The westy spare tire compartment baffles them.  They
&gt; know it opens, but they can't figure out how, so instead of looking
&gt; stupid, they just pass over it.  Also, the spare tire well in the rear
&gt; closet of my westy is safe.  I accidentally forgot about a bottle of
&gt; scotch i had in there, and they didn't find it, because they didn't know
&gt; it was there...
&gt; 
&gt; The best part about it is when they come up empty handed :-P
