Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.4.02A.9904200944490.27132-100000_at_insci14.ucsd_dot_edu&gt;

I am rebiulding a '77 van engine (2 L, FI, type 4).  I measured my
crankshaft end play with one shim removed: .016 inces, then I measured the
shim: .013 inches, so great, I've got .003 endplay, which is within the
.003-.005 spec in my book.  So I bolt it all together, measure before
adding the big rubber seal, again .003, so I remove it all, press in the
rubber seal, tork down my torque converter (would be flywheel, but this is
an auto bus), and measure one last time 0.00275, or thats my estimate.  I
measure several times, each time its just a hair under 0.003.  I measured
all this with a dial indicator, a $10 harbor freaght one, which is
graduated in units of 0.001&quot;.  So now I'm freeking out a little, thinking
that maybe I should pull the gasket (ruining it) and get a 0.012&quot; shim,
thus bringing endplay closer to the ideal 0.004&quot;.  Any thoughts about
this?  One of my manuals says 0.003-0.005 with a max wear of 0.007,
suggesting that there is some room for error (of course there must be),
and also that the number tends to increase with age of the engine, so that
mine would migrate towards the higher (and more correct) values during its
service life.  Any thougth of practical experience would be great for my
sleeping.
