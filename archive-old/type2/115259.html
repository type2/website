Subject: Re: [T2] re: gas pedal problems on 72 westy

I have a put small black bungee on mine as well, except that mine is in the
engine compartment. It runs from where the throttle cable attaches to the
linkage up to the roof of the engine compartment. It was a quick roadside
fix that I have kept because I like the improved throttle response when I
step off of the gas.
Maybe some of our resident experts could tell me: Was there supposed to be a
return spring there?
Cheers,
Matthew
