Subject: Yokohama Y356D Tires

It has now been a week since I had my brand new Yokohama Y356D's installed
that I purchased from tirerack_dot_com.  These tires have made a huge difference
in how the bus drives and handles.  I thought that I would give everyone
some feedback on how good they are.

1. Living in the Chicago area means that it is always windy and the last
week we have seen our share of thunderstorms.  The bus hardly reacts at all
to the wind like it did with the previous tires.  Even strong gusts don't
move it like it did with the other tires.
2. Bearing the load - These tires don't feel like they are going to pop when
I have to get off the expressway and make a sharper than desired turn.
Before my bus felt like it was going to always blow out the tire that was
bearing all of the weight.
3. They are so quiet!!!  I can't believe that changing tires would make such
a difference, but these things are great.
4. My bus handles better at slower speeds.  It doesn't feel all squishy when
I have to make a sharp turn either.
5. On the negative side, they don't have a whitewall.  I can live without
that due to the other things.

I am so satisfied with these tires and with tirerack_dot_com for getting me the
tires that I wanted.  They are 8 ply and I would recommend these tires to
anyone that is looking to get new tires.  Outside of replacing all of the
old fuel lines, this is the biggest improvement that I have made to my bus.

Have a good one,

Ted Kitch
