&gt; Most of the above tires are also available in 195/75/R14, load range C and

&gt; me know.

Definitely not a better choice.  Too small in diameter and the 75 series
tires have lower load capacities for a given load rating.  You need &quot;D&quot;
rated tires in 195/75-14 where you only need &quot;C&quot; in 185R14.  Stick with
the straight 185-14

&gt; #1.  IS THIS TRUE? &quot;There isn't any good argument for spending $109 for the
&gt; Agilis, when the $50 Continental will do almost same thing for the vehicle.&quot;

I'd tend to agree.  The spec for a bus is 1520 pounds max load, more than
that is nice, but not required.

&gt; #2.  I AM UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS PIECE OF DATA: The
&gt; Yokohama 356D shows a measured tire width of 5 inches, and all the other
&gt; brands show a 5.5 measured tire width. Is this significant?

Tire widths do vary within sizes.  Not really significant.

&gt; #3.  IS THIS TRUE? &quot;All the above listed tires will fit my steel 5.5 x 14
&gt; H1 ET39 original rims and will meet the MINIMUM load-bearing requirements
&gt; for the vehicle.&quot; I can't go wrong safety-wise buying any of the above
&gt; tires...

True.

&gt; #4   IS THIS TRUE? &quot;All of the above tires have reinforced sidewalls that
&gt; will stabilize the vehicle...

Some may be more reinforced than others

&gt; #5   IS THIS TRUE? &quot;None of the above tires will make the vehicle ride so
&gt; stiffly...

True.

&gt; And the same argument applies to all those brands in between. For instance,
&gt; why should I buy the Bridgestones over the Continentals?

Availability.  I bought the bridestones because they were available at a
good price locally.  Next time I'll check the Continental dealer

&gt; Are the Yokohama's a slightly better choice than the Continentals?...

I doubt that I could tell the difference.  Frankly, bus tires serve to
hold the rims off of the ground.  There is some handling considerations in
sidewall stiffness, but if they are reinforced they should all do fine.
Buses aren't exactly &quot;driver's cars&quot;, so the Nth degree in performance is
not required.
