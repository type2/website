 Hi. I've had a couple interested people, but no takers yet, and the bill 
 collector is a-knockin'. Price now even lower, so I can at least get 
 something back out of this, and still meet current obligations. Price 
 negotiable depending on purchase time.
 
 Howdy there. I picked up this 70 bus intending to fix it up as my 
 driver/highway mobile to spell my double cab a bit, but alas at this time 
 bills prevent me finishing it.
 Bus is in Raleigh, NC, with freshly rebuilt engine, new carb, Bosch 
 Distributor &amp; Voltage regulator, good tires, very little rust, especially 
 for an East Coast bus. it's a kombi, so it has no interior in the rear, 
 which just means you have a blank slate for doing your own interior, or 
 throwing in a camper kit. It has some 20 year old Bondo (over dents, not 
 rust 
 holes) that is starting to peel off, but other than 2 spots, even looks good.
 The only thing it really needs is (I think) a headlight switch. The fuses 
 are fine, but no sign of low or high beams, or 1 tail light. I'm asking 
 $1000, which is very negotiable, as unfortunately I have other financial 
 needs that must be dealt with soon. 
 This is basically a good solid bus that will go a long way with a little 
 more fixin'. For more details, or a more specific list of all the work 
 done and needed, please e-mail me. I really need this bus to find a home 
 soon.
 Thanks,
