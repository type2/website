Subject: Compression

Hi Volks!
I just did a compression check on 'blue', and she's at 115,120,122, and 130. 
Not too shabby! She still has life in her. My concern is that all the plugs 
were changed about 2000 miles ago, and the have a lot of carbon build-up. 
Could it be running too rich? or are the rings going? I assume the rings may 
be fine because of the compression, but it is 22 years old with no major 
engine work. Plus it only has 125,000 original miles on it. Any ideas?
