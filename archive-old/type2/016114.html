first step on a restoration, take it to a body shop and get estimates on the
body work. that will most likely be the largest investment in your restoration
and they can tell you if a restoraion is even worth doing. you may have too much
rust for the shops to do the job right. body work is first.

Okay... here's the guff.  Just bought a 72 westy.  Its in not great 
shape, but not bad either.  The engine is out but the tranny, which is 
supposedly okay, is in.   I bought this westy &quot;Folly&quot; &lt; I think&gt; and a 
parting out van of same vintage for 900 bucks CDN.  Folly's engine was 
tossed in the back of the parts van... I do mean tossed... it was in the 
back of the parting van.  Now, I paid a first visit to that parting van 
today but couldn't toss the engine into my 88 westy cause I didn't have 
the people power.

So, there... a bit of a picture.  Now, you'll have a billion questions 
over the next few months / years.  Here are two...

Where should I begin this slow restoration process... engine... 
brakes... body work?  Wadda ya think?

Where can I get a Bently for Folly, cheap?

Okay, three... I hope Folly is an orginal, if not, I'll change it!!!

Thanks.
