Subject: re: Flywheel won't budge

Jamie; 

The flywheel should just slide right off by pulling it towards you once
the gland nut is off. Assuming you have the same engine as me - and I
think you do, from what I remember from your adventures up in Ontario a
few weeks back! (1600 type 1?). 

One of the dowels may be bent, or the flywheel slightly warped or
something, but nothing else holds it on but the gland nut. 

Did you have fun getting the gland nut off?? I promised myself I'd rent a
flywheel locker next time I have to do that.

ps - use a new gland nut when you put it back on! 

cheers
