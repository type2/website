Dave:

I had the same problem last year (and god, doesn't the
wife hate being 50 or so miles away from home and
driving with no clutch...some people just don't get
it).  I never figured out exactly what caused the
problem, but my theory is a clogged/crappy cable tube
combined with crummy Brazilian/ Mexican/Italian cables,
which broke off at the driver's end.  I went through 3
or 4 of them before I went to the dealer (!) and
ordered a $17. clutch cable, honest to god CHERMAN VW. 
It does come with all new hardware and a new Bowden
tube, so it's not so outrageous.  And, oh yeah, it
doesn't break (although I've probably jinxed myself now).

Good Luck:
