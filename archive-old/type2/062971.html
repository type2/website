Subject: Re: Online Bus Raffle? (was Re: Who's going to Jerome?)

ok---here is a scarry idea---

My 76 Westy is for sale---I need to get $2500 out of it to help pay 
for my new 79 Westy.

If I can sell at least 100 raffle tickets _at_ $25.00 each that would 
cover it.

OK---Give me some input---Is this ethical/Legal---Sounds like a fun 
way to sell my bus and give at least 100 of us folks a $25 chance on 
getting an OK Westy???
