Subject: GEX update

I just returned from the garage and hada look at the head in question. The
intake vlave seat on number was not dropped or dislodged by pushed
in a fraction. There was exhaust etc from where the head was not meeting
the cylinder. Any one familiar with this one?

Cheers - DC
PS thanks for the advice from all. If it were not for a) the fact that
the  first engine I had from GEX had to be replaced (without ever being
run) because
the end play was out of spec by a wide margin, b) the head failure at 20k
c) a drop in compression in all cylinders from 145-110 in a short year and d)
the general opinion of them on the internet I would probably go with GEX.
Maybe they will get this message????
