Subject: Re: [T2] KYB Gas-a-justs shocks

&gt; Well, like I've said before, I like the KYBs on the back. With the
&gt; original oil filled shocks up front the bus feels nicely balanced. I'd
&gt; like to try the KYBs on the fronts too. But that will have to wait for
&gt; the 71 to hit the road since I'm getting the Konis for the GWB.

I have KYB's GA's all the way around my '71 right now and the ride is a bit 
stiff.  I am considering going to the Alco shocks up front from the Bus Depot 
and see if that is better.  I really am very disappointed I missed the big Koni 
buy, I would have just LOVED to have a set of those on my bus.  I guess I 
will just have to keep on checking the swaps, maybe I will get lucky.
