Subject: Where Are You?????

I love these lists, hearing about trips, seeing busses for sale, listening
to people who could use a hand.  But it is so frustrating reading through a
post, being interested in what is going on, but then at the end there is
only a name and a listing of VW's.

Knowing this is the World Wide Web, please don't treat emails as if the
person you are talking to knows where you live, we may not even be in the
same country!!

If you are tring to keep your location a secret, at least let us know what
country and state you live in.

This group is a lot of fun and I am not afraid to let you all know wherer I
live.  So if you are ever in my area, give me a call, there is always a
cold beer in the fridge and I have a great bass pond you can drown a few
worms in.
