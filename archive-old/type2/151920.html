&gt; There is a T2 question here. There's a nearly square box with a rubber
&gt; cover on five sides that has input and output for the speedo cable and
&gt; an round electrical connector. What is that part and where is it
&gt; supposed to mounted? Mine is not secured but fits snugly between the
&gt; lip of the floor and the inside of the nose behind the kick panel..

that's the way all of the ones I've seen have been.  speaking of that my
speedo cable has broken is there an easy way to determine which cable
broke...
