Since this debate has been going on all week, I thought I'd add this handy 
guide to decipher VW bus ads:

1) Rust-free ( my personal favorite) - 200 lbs of bondo covering all the rust

2) Has Minor Rust- The rockers are completely gone, the battery is on a piece 
of plywood, and the windshield is about to fall out.

3) Calif./AZ car- I bought it out there for $2,500.00 and now want $7,500.00 
for it ( East Coast ads only)

4) Rebuilt engine- I dumped a can of &quot;Motor Medic&quot; in the crankcase last week

5) 200 miles on  professionally rebuilt engine-  done by GEX and it's already 
got a knock, trying to get rid of it before it blows again

6) Rebuilt engine w/5K on it, not running- another GEX rebuild

7) Project car, no time to complete- I've taken it all apart and can't figure 
out how to put it back together. Bring boxes.

8) Drive it anywhere- better get AAA+ or God Sam membership first

9) Needs nothing- needs EVERYTHING.

10) Not driven in last 8 years- has been used as storage shed/chicken 
coop/mouse condo

Some of my other favorites: You're looking at a bus thats worth maybe 5 or 6 
hundred bucks, and the seller is saying &quot; I've found something else I want to 
buy, and it's $3,000.00, so I gotta get $3,000.00 for this one&quot; and the ads 
that read &quot;Wanted- Westy in good condition. Must run and have little/no rust. 
Willing to pay $1,000.00 to $1,500.00&quot;       

Have A Good Weekend!    Jeff S.
