 &lt;&lt;  I am not a pilot
  nor do I play one on my computer (never got the hang of those flight sims).
  I am open to other reccomendations! &gt;&gt;
 
   I am not a pilot but I am an aircraft mechanic and CO poisoning is 
something to be very much on guard against.  Sporty's pilot shop and most 
airport shops where planes are serviced sell a small (2&quot; square or so) 
passive CO detector.  This is self adhesive and can be mounted on the dash.  
It is a plastic panel with a circle of chemical that is yellowish white in 
the center.  When exposed to CO it turns brown to black and is good for 
several months.  They sell for about $5.00.
