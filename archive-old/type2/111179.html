Subject: Re: [T2] intake air vent rust removal (see pics)

Hello,

With mine, I used a Dremel tool with the snake like
extension that you can get for it. The extension
allows you to wire brush quite a bit of the inside of
the vent because it fits through the vent slots. I
used that with a pencil shaped wire brush attachment
and some paint stripper. I will spray Por-15 grey to
cover the area and then I will use Por-15 Whitecote to
finish it. I will mask off the outside of the vent so
no Por-15 gets on it. I will just paint the outside of
the vent with regular automotive paint when I paint
the rest of the bus. 

Good Luck!

&gt; It's the rust I'm 
&gt; worried about mainly because it's such a difficult
&gt; spot to get to.  I've 
&gt; conteplated a few possibilities and would like to
&gt; know what's best.  Is 
&gt; sandblasting an option?  Perhaps an anti rust
&gt; product like POR-15 (which 
&gt; I havn't used yet).  After all it's not like
&gt; nobody's looking in there. 
&gt;  What about cutting it open and welding it back. 
&gt; The thought scares me. 
&gt;  I also notice a seam behind the headliner inside
&gt; the car.  Can I open 
&gt; things up from in there?  I'm moslty curious to know
&gt; what people have 
&gt; done in similar situations.  No doubt I'm not the
&gt; only one who's hiding 
&gt; some rust back there.
&gt; 
&gt;     Thanks for the advice,
&gt; 
&gt;     elijah
