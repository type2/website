&gt; Could be true, but do you really think this part is so sought after that
&gt; people will envy you :-)

Jan....

LOL!!! Believe me, I know the difference between rare and desirable... :-)
Hantavirus, for instance is rare, but not terribly desirable; Westy
tents are not particularly rare, but *very* desirable!

I was amazed that anyone would shell out the extra money for the Wolfsburg
interior and then not get a radio.  There is a frame screwed in under the
dash for an aftermarket radio and some wierd wiring for speakers that will
be coming out as part of the general inspection of the wiring.  Some of
the wiring on this beast is already terrifying me and I expect to have to
go over the harness and fuse box with a fine tooth comb.  Quelle bummer!!!
