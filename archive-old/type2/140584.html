Subject: Re: [T2] k&amp;n air filter

Sam said:


 Tonight i went out to the garage and i took a look at
the air filter that was currently in my bus oh my god
it was nasty and dirty thank god earlier in the week i
went my local auto parts store and i special ordered a
k&amp;n air filter for my bus. Currently i am using one in
my jetta. Anyone on the list currently using one in
there bus and did they see a improvment in horse power
and fuel economy like k&amp;N proves you get better buy
using there airfilter well take care to all I am so
happy the weather in CT has been so mild it has been
50 for the last 2 days a nd i can drive my bus and
break in the engine with 400 miles on her so far she
has been handling beautifully thank you Bob Donalds at
Boston Engine

Here is an interesting test of K&amp;N against other filters. Granted, the base subject was a Chevrolet filter,
but the comparison was using other filters that fit the same vehicle. It would not matter if it were all Yugo
filters or all Mercedes filters. The results are not skewed.

I would love to see REAL results to contradict this, NOT seat-of-the-pants BS like 'It felt more powerfull'
crap.
