Subject: Re: Oil leaks

Any time we changed our gasket covers, we took off the old covers, put
some weatherstrip cement on the gasket and the cover, let it get tacky
and then put the gasket in the cover.  Don't put any cement on the part
that touches the engine though.  Then just put the cover back on and you
shouldn't have any problems.  The cement holds the gasket in place so
it's not slipping out of the cover when you're movin the cover around
trying to get the spring over the cover.  If you still have a leak, it's
probably because the spring that holds the cover on is loose and you'll
need to get a tighter one.

later,
Mike

&gt; I just replaced the valve cover gaskets and the driver's side is leaking.  I
&gt; have another gasket but was wondering if anyone knows of any tricks for
&gt; preventing a repeat leak.
&gt; It also appears that my oil cooler is leaking.  I have the two gasket for
&gt; that but am not sure if that is a simple fix or not...any thoughts?
&gt; Thanks,
