Subject: Mexico says adios to beloved VW van



 Mexico says adios to beloved VW van
 By Mark Stevenson, Associated Press, 11/24/2001

 MEXICO CITY - The era of peace and love really is over: The Volkswagen
 van that took a generation on long, strange trips is going out of
 production in Mexico at year's end.

 Sales are scheduled to halt at the end of next month. And in Brazil,
 the only other place where the boxy VW bus is still being made, union
 officials say they suspect Volkswagen is planning to end production
 soon as part of cost-cutting measures.

 The van, known in Latin America as the Combi, was introduced in 1950.
 Distinctive because of its air-cooled, rear-mounted engine, the van
 was last offered in 1982 in the United States as the Transporter.

 It is being replaced in the VW lineup by the Eurovan, a more modern
 vehicle with a water-cooled front engine.

 The demise of the old bus has saddened a lot of old hippies here, as
 Volkswagen conceded with full-page ads in Mexican newspapers that read
 ''Adios, Combi'' above a picture of a teary-eyed, aging flower-child
 in a tie-dyed shirt.

 ''I think it's going to be a big surprise for Volkswagen fans that
 they were still making them down there,'' said Ryan Price, editor of
 the magazine VW Trends. ''In the same sentence, I think there will be
 some remorse.

 ''It's the end of an era. It came to symbolize a certain sense of
 freedom, as if they could go anywhere.''

 That was the basis of the bus's reputation in Latin America, which was
 a little different than in the United States, where it endures as a
 1960s icon.

 Multicolored paint jobs are uncommon here, and the vehicle is more
 prized for its sturdiness, seating capacity, and high ground clearance
 - a must for dirt roads and mountain villages.

 Proof of the difference? In Brazil, one of the last big customers for
 the Combi is the army, which uses them to move personnel.

 Volkswagen officially lists the Combi's capacity as ''eight to 11
 passengers.'' In some parts of Mexico, groaning microbuses are still
 used as buses, somehow carrying as many as 18 to 20 people, not always
 in strict adherence to safety rules.

 Volkswagen said in a statement that the Eurovan would ''offer the
 modernity, new technology, and space that current customers demand.''

 The famous Volkswagen sedan - the original Beetle, or ''Bug'' - will
 continue to be produced at VW's Mexico plant.  Green-painted Beetle
 taxis are as common in Mexico City as black cabs in Britain.

 While Volkswagen officials in Brazil refuse to say when or if
 production of the Combi would end, unions there - currently on strike
 at one VW plant to protest cost-cutting - say the company is
 uninterested in keeping old production lines going.

 For the last five years, production has been split, with Mexico
 manufacturing the Combi's engines and a Brazilian plant making the
 chassis. It is unclear where Brazil would get the motors to continue
 making the model.

 ''It's an absurd decision. I wish they wouldn't kill it,'' said Israel
 Gomez, 28, whose 1964 ''panoramic'' microbus - which has 21 windows -
 draws admiring glances on Mexico City streets. ''It's made for road
 trips. It has great sight lines.

 ''I can't imagine Mexico without Combis,'' Gomez said. ''It's a
 vehicle that's part of history here.''
