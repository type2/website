Dear Tachless David,

You might check out one of your local RPM/MPH calculators, such as:

http://www.cbperformance_dot_com/tc_frame.htm &lt;&lt;--- that one... to give you an
idea of... well... RPM/MPH per gear.

I think your 72 still has the 3.80, 2.06, 1.26 and .82 (1,2,3,4th gears).
Find out your R&amp;P gearing (4.86 or still the 5.375?), and put in a maximum
of 8000 RPM (we can dream, eh?).

I can sit and look at the results all day!

&gt; Volks,
&gt;
&gt;   I dont have a tach and was wondering on my 72 poptop pancake, what is my
&gt; rpm in relation to speed in each gear. As in, when should I go from 2-3rd
and
&gt; 3rd to 4th what speed is a good shift speed and where is my rpm at that
time
&gt; on a 1800??? We have lots of long tall hills in CO  and I would think Ill
&gt; need to climb in 3rd maybe 2nd, where would be a safe long 3rd and 2nd
&gt; climbing speed\rpm.
&gt;    Tachless in CO
&gt;   Thankyou,
&gt;    David
&gt;
