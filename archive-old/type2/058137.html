Subject: Weber and vac dizzy

Is it possible to use a vacuum advance distributer with a Weber progressive
2 bbl carb? I am sick to death of trying to adjust the 34 pict 3 on my bus,
trying to get it to idle below 1000 rpm. I'm thinking a different carb may
be in order for two reasons:
1) Stock solex does not cotton to modified engine like mine (lower
compression, bigger jugs)
2) The damn thing may just be worn out.

When I adjust it, I do get some response from screwing the mixture screw in
and out, but the idle speed screw (the fat one) bottoms in its bore before
I can get the idle below 1000. This has a lot to do with timing, I think. I
am running 37 degrees total advance (no flaming or lectures please, it's
per the advice of Gene Berg enterprises due to the fact that I am running
their &quot;semi-hemi heads) and cranking up the advance makes the thing idle
faster.

Anyway, I'm thinking of a Weber two barrel. Can't use dualies 'cause I got
a gas heater installed and the two systems simply cannot share an engine
room.

But I DETEST 009 distributors--the advance curve is all wrong for a bus,
So, can anyone tell me if it's possible to run a Weber with the stock
vaccuum advance dizzy?

Many thanks
Bob
