Last year a few Type2 people complained about not hearing about BBTT, 
so here it is in plenty of time:

http://www.enter_dot_net/~bloss/vw/bbtt/

Please make reservations with the campground early so we can be 
placed together.  Details are on the web page.  If you have an e-mail 
only acct. (e.g. juno), p-mail me and I'll get you details.

BTW, I'll be at Carlisle, PA this weekend for the import show, so 
stop by and say hello.  I'll be on the show field with the LiMBO 
crowd.

Regards,

-Karl
