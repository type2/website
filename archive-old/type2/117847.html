Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel pump trouble?

Barry,

If those were the ones that I looked at....you *dud* notice that they are 
all **mechanical**!!

for example...That means a copper tube from the oil pressure to the 
gauge...maybe 5 feet for an american car, but 20+ feet for a bus is waaay
overboard.

good luck, dave

&gt; &gt;Thanks for the lead on the gauges, Barry.  I ordered a set :)
&gt; 
&gt; Did you notice that there was a set price for shipping, if you ordered ONE 
&gt; set or 10 sets!!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, thanks for mentioning.
