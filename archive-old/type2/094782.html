&gt;Any thoughts?

Hi Jan,
	I would hose this thing down with carb cleaner to begin with, and as you 
are checking things out, see if any fuel is leaking from the carb.  Anywhere 
fuel leaks, air can enter.  I have had bad diaphragms cause this, as well as 
clogged air-correction jets.  Pull every jet and clean them all with a can 
of carb cleaner.  Clean every passage that the jets supply fuel to, and draw 
fuel through.  If this doesn't solve the problem, rebuild the unit.  At this 
point you will probably only need to replace the diaphragms, barring the 
possibility that there is rust inside the bowl.  Another thing oft 
overlooked is the needle and seat and float level.  CHeck to make sure they 
are spec.  Happy atomizing!

	Eron
