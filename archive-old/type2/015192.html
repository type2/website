Ian,

Sorry to see that you are leaving the list as the Aussie presence
on the list is a bit underwhelming as it is,given the number of
Kombis of all descriptions on our roads.

Anyway I just wanted to say thanks for introducing the list to me
in the first place some years ago and I've enjoyed talking VWs
with you since then both on &amp; often off the list.

Hope you can safely remain a &quot;Volvo Aware Rider&quot; on your motorbikes
and don't hesitate to get in contact in the future if you need any
T2 bits you can't locate locally.

Best of luck for the future and hopefully we'll see you back on the
list sometime.

Cheers,

Steve O.
