Howdy again folks,      Well, my bus is being packed up tonight for
another adventure out into the beyond.  I'm heading southwest in hopes of
finding sunlight.  Over the course of the next couple weeks I hope to be
down in the Grand Canyon area, then north through Colorado (Telluride,
Crested Butte, Aspen, Leadville, Boulder, Estes Park, etc.)  Steve Dolan,
maybe we'll cross paths.....I'll be on the lookout for your creme colored
' 80 Westy.  I'll be in my chrome yellow ' 77 Riviera poptop.  If you see
me on a freeway, it's probably not me.......I tend to stick to the 2
laners and gravel roads.
        I'm crossing my fingers that the bus holds up well.  If I'm
parked on the shoulder, don't hesitate to stop and say hello, or more
likely, diagnose and help me fix my problem.  ;-)

Regards,   Kevin  Snow
