Hi Craig,

The el-cheapo solution is foam pipe insulation. You can buy six-foot lengths
at Home depot for about $1.50 each, they already come pre-glued with
double-sided tape! 

In time it will flatten out, but it's certainly cheap enough to replace
annually. Black cloth (Duct) tape on the end joints will help keep it from
peeling. I ran my 73 Rustfalia with this type of seal through three winters
and it worked OK for me, YMMV.

IIRC there never was a seal on the cargo rack,  it doesn't come into contact
with the roof so it doesn't need one.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; 
&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone ever come up with a good subsitute for the rubber seal around
&gt; the pop-top and cargo rack?  I have a 72 westy and was wondering if
&gt; there was a cheaper solution?
