Subject: Pumping gas 101

Hello all,

I've pumped gas once or twice in my lifetime, but I've never had happen wha=
t
happened to me this morning while I was trying to fill up my '78. It had
under a quarter of a tank and after I pumped a few dollars in I snapped out
of my standard gas pumping zen-like trance and noticed a small puddle of ga=
s
developing below my gas tank. At first, it wasn't dripping out of the
opening of the tank, but rather somewhere underneath=8Bbut not from the gas
tank. Stupidly I suppose, I tried pumping some more and this time the gas
started pouring out of the gas tank opening by the nozzle. So basically it
seemed to act as if my tank was full, but it was nowhere near full=8Bjust ove=
r
a quarter of a tank actually. This is only the third time I've tried fillin=
g
her up (new owner here), but this didn't happen the first two times. As far
as a leak in the gas tank=8Bthere is none. I drove off and the fuel gauge
remained steady. I then parked it and returned an hour later to no pools of
gas on the ground. It seems to me I just somehow  pumped the gas wrong, but
I'll be damned if I can figure out how. Is this a somewhat common Bus
occurrence? I can tie my own shoes, I swear.

Steve
