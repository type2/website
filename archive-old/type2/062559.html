Hi All,

The latest Classic Motorbooks catalog came yesterday, and as usual I 
(ahem) &quot;sat&quot; in the porcelain library reading their latest book 
offerings. 

One thing that struck me was a new book called &quot;Air-Cooled VW Engine 
Interchange Manual&quot; by Keith Seume. It claims to: 

&quot;Find out which parts will fit your engine and what they'll do for it 
with this valuable guide to all engine, ignition and carburetion parts 
for your classic VW engine. Filled with parts and tuning recommendations 
on equipping engines for economy performance, mild performance increases, 
fast road or full race performance. Includes stock part interchange specs 
and parts numbers, and describes the wide range of aftermarket parts 
available. Softbound. 144 pages, 300 b&amp;w illustrations. 19.95. Not 
available until 10/15/96.&quot;

Sounds potentially like this book could be pretty useful. Anybody read 
anything else by this Mr. Seume?

If you're interested in ordering, Classic Motorbooks phone number is 
800/826-6600. For those of you outside the North American toll free 
dialing area or those who wish to send an email, they can be reached at 
mbibks_at_win.bright_dot_net

I am not associated with them in any way, shape or form. Just a satisfied 
customer.


Cheers,

Bren
