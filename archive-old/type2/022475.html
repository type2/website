And Jim added:

&gt;You have disc brakes on your Super? I can assure you that it didn't come
&gt;that way! And further assure you that they won't fit (SB has 15&quot; tires; bus
&gt;has 14&quot; ones). They probably won't go on the standard bug either; the
&gt;suspensions on SB and standard beetles are different.

The S and LS Superbeetle models came with disc brakes here in Europe, 
you might have a Euro model superbug, or a US model with altered brakes. 
Even though disc brakes have the advantage in that they are auto-adjusted, 
this setup is not really an upgrade, well maintaned drum brakes 'feel' like 
they bite better, and stop sooner, at least, that how I felt, I've never did any 
test or anything. The pads seem like they would be small on a go-cart, 
and they require more pedal pressure than drumbrake cars. The master 
cylinder is different for disc brakes, different in that it will not keep a slight 
overpressure in the system while not in use, like drumbrake cars have. 
14&quot; wheels fit over this setup. It will not fit any bus, nor will the spindles 
fit a standard Bug, however, if you find original VW spindles for the 
standard Bug, I think that the discs will bolt right on, and the calipers as 
well. You'll need a master cylinder for a 1600 engined standard Euro Bug.

For a Bug a good upgrade would be to go to 356 drumbrakes, though 
the stock drumbrakes are perfect for a stock engined car. The cheap 
after market disc brake set ups seem to use the small VW caliper, and 
again, that is not really an improvement, although it might seem like 
one when you replace worn/unmaintained drumbrakes with them. 

 For the Bus you could retrofit later parts from a donor bus, I would get 
the master cylinder and brakebooster as well, I have no idea if it is 
a straight bolt on.

Hope it helps,

Brian
