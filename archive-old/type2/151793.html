Subject: Re: [T2] 69 Bus No spark ?

Bob,

Points??????  No points opening and closing, then no spark.

Verify points gap and condition of points....Don't wonder, takethem out 
and look...or leave them in and look.

Rotate engine while looking...does the rotor move? 

Don't touch anything else till you get spark....consider electronic 
points.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Help,
&gt; 
&gt; 69 bus, 1600 sp.
&gt; 
&gt; Ran fine, turned engine off after getting to work,
&gt; evening, no start.
&gt; 
&gt; Checklist run, no spark observed from HT wire from
&gt; coil to distributor when disconnected from rotor and
&gt; leaning against metal of distributor body while
&gt; cranking.
&gt; 
&gt; New coil, same problem.  Verified that the ignition
&gt; wire (15) is getting power by holding against metal
&gt; distributor body with ignition on, sparking observed.

&gt; 
&gt; Help in what to check next !
