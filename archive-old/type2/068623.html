Subject: Front End clunking funkily, and, a trip update..

Hey alls...

I'm now here in the sometimes cold midwest...Kansas City to be exact. 
the trip from augusta went great..at least, except till my heater cable 
broke on a cold day outside of li'l rock...tied it open&lt;still...&gt; with 
bailing wire...oh, and yeah...just one broke...other was broke when i got 
the bus!:) so its been open too....



anyhow, i took I-20 to anniston, saw some family, then went down 78 
through birmingham, and...oh...the megajunktypeplacefullofVW's...yeah, 
its there. right down 78, outside of oxford. about 2 miles off of Quintard..
i didnt stop for a few reasons...one: cold. two: pissy mood. three: it 
looked closed...  four! lazy!!:)

anyway, it looked like some had been cleared out, but at parts they were 
definitly stacked 3 high, at least...but anyhow...

so, 78 on to memphis, then to li'l rock..&lt;i think, dont quite remmeber 
for sure...&gt; anyway, somewhere i got on i-40, to Ft. Smith, onto 71, 
which, btw, was a FUN drive!! to joplin, saw some old friends &lt;as in, i 
last saw this guy when i was 4....&gt; then on to KC, where i have been 
working my ass off at rockhurst college, helping my dad finish getting 
this show done on time....btw, anyone got any job openings in the KC area 
other thatn &quot;the paper&quot;?...:)


anyhow, so, the bus sat in harrisonville most of this week while i car 
pooled from there &lt;dad's girlfriends house...&gt; to to school with 
dad...now, as i've started to drive it again, it makes a very feelable 
&quot;kaclunk&quot; at odd times. usually as i turn the wheel from center to the 
left. and i can usually reroduce the sound at anytime....at least, since 
it started.

and, since its been wet tonight, i've yet to really look under there. 
but, i couldnt quite see anything wrong, but...of course, i cant turn the 
wheel and look at the contraptions under the bus at the same time now can 
i?!?

oh, did i mention that it is defnitly comming from the right wheel 
area..front...

it feels about like running over a medium sized dog at 45...anytime it 
happens.:(

i had first thought the wheel was rubbing the fender...but 
no....soo....its up to you guys....



thanks.....





&lt;a quick note to ftg96....i lost the version of this i had for you and 
mike...armory crashed on me..:( so, this will work, and....what is this 
about shaun? and more, pass this on to mike 4 me...thanks....&gt;
