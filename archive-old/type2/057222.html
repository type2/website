List-
Please put up with my questions, I don't have time to look everything up. I
have to work fast and get this bus going before the landlord gets back.
I'm puting a 74 1.8 L in a 72 Westy.
-Is the 74 alternator compatable with the 72 electrical system?
-Are the alternator and generator interchangable?
-Since a change may have already been made , how can I tell them (alt.&amp;
gen.) apart by loooking at them?
-Where exactly does the Ground (-) from the battery connect to the frame or
engine?
-What solvent can I spray onto all these greasy push-on electrical
connectors so I will get a good connection?
Thanks,
John Ingram
