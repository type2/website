Subject: Rear Spline Grease Revisited
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.A41.4.03.9903091252290.18680-100000_at_dakota.gate_dot_net&gt;

Well 6 replies told me to use wheel bearing grease, which is what Ive
always used BTW. The reason I wondered is that I was never happy with what
the bearing grease looked like when the drums came off. Todd and Cal both
suggested Permatex anti seize in the grey(silver?) pkg. Reasons that it
wouldnt dry or wash out like grease. That seems like a good reson to me so
Im trying it.
