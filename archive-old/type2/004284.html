I would like to thank all of the members who forwarded me diagrams and
descriptions on how to re-hook up my Aux battery.   I had to remove it to
replace flywheel seal and forgot how to hook it up.  OR so I thought.  I
checked my wiring and it was exactly like Patrick Dolan describes below.  I
looked closer at the relay and saw that there was a fuse on the side of the
relay.  I removed it, couldn't tell if it was blown or not but went ahead
and replace it with another 15 amp fuse and all is well again.

Hope this helps someone in the future.

Thanks again, the list rules.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,

&gt; hey- so here is what I did: mounted the relay box, leads pointing up,
&gt; to one of the left side screws that holds the fire wall in place.
&gt; Terminal 86 went to coil+. Terminal 87 went to aux battery+. Terminal
&gt; 30 went to the main battery with a ~20 amp fuse in between (16 - 25
&gt; amp is ok, no higher). Terminal 85 went to ground, which I used
&gt; another screw that holds in the firewall.  A better solution (though I
&gt; didn't do it) is to connect the ground to the lead from the alternator
&gt; to your dashboard idiot light. The merit of this was recently
&gt; discussed on the type2 list. The idea is that if aux battery is
&gt; completely drained, the main battery will start trickle charging as
&gt; soon as you turn the key, before the bus is even running and could rob
&gt; it of enough juice to start the bus. By grounding it to the idiot
&gt; light, it doesn't start trickle charging the aux battery until the bus
&gt; is actually running.  I've also heard you can do this with the lead
&gt; from terminal 86.  I've never had a problem with the simple way but I
&gt; don't know if I ever completely drained my aux battery, and I have a
&gt; pretty strong main battery. I grounded the aux battery in the same
&gt; place the main battery is grounded since I couldn't find a suitable
&gt; place on the left side of the motor.
