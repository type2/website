Subject: Re: Sticking a tap in a heater box

+AD4-You can't just tap sheet metal like that, it doesn't work.  The heater
boxes
+AD4-have clinch/weld nut inserts on them (like your engine tin).  You might be
+AD4-able to use a self tapping screw, +ACM-12 maybe, or weld a nut on, but it needs
+AD4-to go on the inside so things get tricky.  Do you know any mice with
welding
+AD4-skills?

+AD4APg- fresh arm. However, the heater boxes I put on don't seem to
+AD4APg- have a hole for
+AD4APg- the bottom end of the damn thing.
+AD4APg-
+AD4APg- So:
+AD4APg-
+AD4APg- Where do I tap?
+AD4APg- If I go tapping holes into the heater boxes, am I gonna get
+AD4APg- an exhaust leak?
+AD4APg- Any suggestions for alternate methods?


I don't know if this helps, but I had my boxes apart to switch the covers
over from an earlier model. This required a load of messing about and I
won't do it again. The later heater boxes have a thread in them with a hole
through the outer tin. Some earlier ones don't have the support bracket, but
there is the same lump of metal inside into which you can tap a hole. You'd
just drill through the outer case and into the inner pipework. There's a
flat on the outer tin where to drill, though I've no idea how deep you can
go.

I don't think you would want to rely on a threaded insert into the outer
tin.

I decided in the end not to fit a bracket as I reasoned that the earlier
ones managed to get away without them, and so far in 1 1/2 years it's not
given any trouble.
