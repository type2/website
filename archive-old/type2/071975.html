&gt;Sean wrote me privately about a shifter rattle that was driving him
&gt;bonkers.  I am posting my response, because I I have the same problem and
&gt;would love to hear a solution.  My take on the problem is that it is a
&gt;combination of factors, worn bushings, wear in the trans, and the ball and
&gt;cup getting worn over time.  Replacing the &quot;shuttlecock&quot; guide bushings
&gt;on the shifter rod would help, if anyone made them.  Replacing the shift
&gt;coupler does help, but is only one step in the process, and it seems a bit
&gt;extreme to rebuild the trans for an annoyance.

Mine used to rattle.  I found that it was the shift linkage hitting the
frame where it passes through just before the coupler.  I fixed it by
adjusting the front transaxle mount.  Something to check anyway...
