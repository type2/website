Subject: Re: [T2] New Carb Question

Hi,

It's actually the old carb that is leaking, not the new one I got from
Richard (as far as I can tell that does not leak). But, it is the new
one from Richard that I cannot get running. I'd like to exhaust all
options for getting the new carb running before I'm forced to contact
Richard for a possible return.

Thanks
jules

&gt; The carb I sent to Richard Carey for rebuilding also leaked gasoline when
&gt; it came back to me.  I took it back over (I'm local) and they reworked it
&gt; (within a day), but it still leaked fuel in the same manner as you describe
&gt; when I reinstalled it. My fuel bowl would actually weep and become damp
&gt; with fuel, almost like it was porous. I returned it to them and exchanged
&gt; it for another rebuilt carb.  The second one was fine.
