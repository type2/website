Subject: RE: [T2] charcoal canister

After late '69 all buses/single cabs/double cabs have charcoal canisters. 

However, in the BustedBus yard I have seen them installed in buses as early
as '68. 

I noticed there are 3 different air cleaners from '68/'69. Even the charcoal
filters can be unique. Some have three ports and some have two. I have seen
air filters for the non-charcoal (one port), one for two-port charcoal
canisters (two ports top half), and one for a three port canister (two ports
one top half and one lower half). I suspect one of the styles was for the
late '69  and carried into the '70 year.

What is really strange I have only ever seen a schematic for the
non-charcoal canister system on the '68/early '69. 

If memory serves me, I also only remember seeing charcoal canisters on
deluxe models for '68/early '69, but that might just be a coincidence. I
suspect the combination of air filters and canisters were installed on
condition of the port the Bus was going to accommodate different emissions
laws. 

The emissions equipment confusion started earlier than just the Type 4
motor!

Can someone help me confirm whether or not the charcoal canister  
first appeared in 1970 or 1971?

Thanks.
