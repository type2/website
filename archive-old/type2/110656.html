Subject: Re: [T2] Busted CV???

&gt; The wife was driving my bus and busted a CV Joint, assuming that was the only
&gt; prob.  Busted it right off the wheel, Broke the bolts (allen head screws???)
&gt; right off in the wheel. OUCH!!!!!!  So, with that in mind, and Just
&gt; happening.  The bus still moves (With one driveline), Oh I didn't mention
&gt; this is the REAR CV, How do I attack this disaster.  I haven't consulted with
&gt; my books yet.  It's seems to be just a  natural reaction to address the list
&gt; and read my book while the feedback comes in.

Been there, sort of. A week or so after doing cv work I lost it on the
road to work. Turned out the cv bolts had backed out and I guess the last
one holding sheared. Got AAA to tow me to home so I didnt have to fix it
on the street.
The bolt that sheared messed up the threads in the stub axle. Got a
matching tap from the good tool supply, got a whole new set of triple
squares from the flaps (old ones were allen). Tapped and reassembled all
good.
The stub axle bad to come out and it was all a PITA but not too horrible.
