Everyone,

I am in trouble and need some help. The trouble is my dog is very ill and is 
in the ICU center of the vet hospital.  She has been there since Saturday.  
So far the bill is $2,000 and they have not conclusively determined what is 
wrong with her.  It's touch and go.  Anyway, my family just gets by.  You 
know, the paycheck to paycheck lifestyle that many American's live.  Well, 
needless to say, we cannot afford to pay the bill.  Even with maxing out my 
credit card there is still quite a bit to pay.  Don't get me wrong, I am not 
asking for hand outs.  What I would like to do is sell some stuff to earn the 
necessary money.  Right now I have several items for sale.  Just go to 
www.photopoint_dot_com to see my photo pages.  When you get to this main page and 
enter my e-mail address (vwdude1957_at_aol_dot_com) and it will show you photo 
albums.  Click on the SAVE ZOE 4 sale items  book to see what I have for 
sale.  I will be adding more items as time permits.  VW people are always 
generous and kind.  I'm looking forward to hearing from you guys. 
Thanks in advance for your help.

Dave
