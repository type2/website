Hi Dave

Do you want PSI? as your dad is pretty heavy for such a short person! :-)

No one is going to get sleep this year at every bus!!  and you can't sleep up
there whilst on the road,, so 

Tell him about the sleeping qualities of your lounge chair,, you know , the one
I usually pass out on... it holds your beers toooo!

LOL, if your cot isn't a little rotten from age, and he can fit length wise,,
and I am sure he will put most of his weight on the side rails anyways,, it will
hold anyone who can climb up there and lay down,,,, notwithstanding those really
heavy, height challenged people... as the PSI increases considerably hahahaha!!

Watch for 2 serious &quot;notches&quot; in his back when he wakes up,, they will match the
side rails of the cot.

Hope that helped!
