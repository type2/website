Subject: Re: [T2] painting an engine

I won't comment on paint versus no paint on an engine where thermodynamics 
are concerned.

I will comment on materials.

Powder-coating only survives about 400 degrees F because that is the oven 
temp they apply it with. They do have higher temp powder coatings though.

My local powder coater charges $40 an hour, as much as she can do in an 
hour. That translates to about 16 wheels if they are all the same color. 
Every color change represents a new hour. (Cleanup time).

I did my shrouds with cheap spray can paint several years ago. We scrubbed 
and soaked the tin, wet sanded it, primered it, wet sanded it, re-primed 
it, wet sanded it, and then applied Rustoleum high temp paint.

This stuff is useless on exhaust as is most paints because it bakes off but 
has survived wonderfully on the tin. It also has a nice shine to it - not 
glossy and not flat. I cured the paint when i re-installed the engine by 
doing the 20 minute cam break in and allowing all to cool again before it 
really got used. Have heard that this does the paint some good. Take it 
with a bit of salt please. Worked for me.

Total cost? Less than $20 + alot of hours.

No chrome on my engine, just painted metal. I'll leave the chrome to the 
trailer queens. I like back roads and dirt roads.

Ciao!
