&gt; I have the 120V outlet in my 77 bus.  I am preaty sure
&gt; that this is hooked up to the second battery.

You cannot get 120V AC out of a 12 V DC battery unless you have some fairly
specialised electronic converter.
I think you should make sure what you have and where the AC socket connects
to, probably just city power.

&gt; I assume that since the battery is 12V you are sucking
&gt; watts 10 times faster than a 12V appliance.

If you do have a cnverter it would be even worse because of the losses in
the converter.

&gt; laptops-computers that is, not pets.

You may well be able to run your laptop directly off the 12V DC. Inquire at
your computer dealer. They may have an adapter cable that plugs into the
cigarette lighter (12 VDC).

&gt;  I have the little floresent on the drivers side, but I would like to get
a good bright
&gt; light(12V?) to read with on those early winter nights.

Use two or more fluoresent lights. These are the best power economy wise.
