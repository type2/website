&gt; &gt;Be careful with prying the engine off of the tranny.  The input shaft
&gt; &gt;of the transmission isn't all that strongly attached, and if you
&gt; &gt;manage to pull it out of the tranmission it'll compound your
headache!
&gt; 
&gt; I understand there's nothing but a circlip holding it? Is that right?
&gt; Tonight that circlip withstood me and Joe prying on the moustache bar,
&gt; wedging against the frame members, me with a 5-foot pipe and him
with a
&gt; crowbar. Nothing gave though.

Yow!  I think that it's actually a threaded stud that holds the input
shaft into the transmission, but I could be mistaken.  In any case, it
can be pulled apart, search the archives for particulars.

&gt; I don't think the engine is coming out. 8) Bear in mind that I am
cluless,

O ye of little faith!  It'll come out one way or another!  Either
you'll pull the input shaft out of the transmission, or you'll pull
the pilot bearing out of the gland nut.  Hopefully, it'll be the latter!

&gt; it looks like there are two choices:
&gt; 
&gt; - dismantle the engine from around the crank, ending up with a
&gt; transaxle with a flywheel, gland nut and crankshaft welded to the
end of
&gt; it. I don't know what I would do with such a thing, it won't even
burn. 8)

Pretty hard to do with the lower engine mount studs holding the cases
together.  I suppose that you could extract them somehow, but there
isn't much stud protruding to get hold of.

&gt; - try to take the differential out of the trans, detach the shaft,
&gt; and end up with an engine with a trans shaft welded to it. Start
cutting
&gt; the clutch off then? I dunno. From Joe's Bentley it looks as if this
&gt; approach is do-able but even if it is, it probably won't be obvious
what is
&gt; stuck to what.

I don't think that it'll come to either of these drastic measures! 
Neither option sounds very pleasant!

&gt; I am able to get something over 1/2&quot; of separation between then
engine and
&gt; trans now. Intelligent people have discouraged me from prying with
metal
&gt; tools. I have tried hammering long, thin wedges of white oak between
the
&gt; engine case and the bell housing but there's not enough purchase. I
can't
&gt; wedge up into the bellhousing because the flywheel is in the way.
&gt; 
&gt; If I can get another body here tomorrow we'll try your way of moving
the
&gt; crank but I am not optimistic. Any other opinions before I try
opening the
&gt; trans?

Give the &quot;turn the crank&quot; method a try.  It took quite a few
back-and-forth operations and a few blue words to get the pilot shaft
out when I did it, so keep at it.  All you need to do is get a little
play into the pilot bearing and the shaft will come out.
