         Sounds a lot like the starter is getting a bit worn, so when
it's hot it take more juice to crank it, and then the coil isn't
gettting enough juice to make a good spark, so it floods. You might want
to pull the starter and take it apart, maybe just new brushes and
regrease the bushings at each end (one end being in the bellhousing).
       What I also did before I switched to FI was that I took the extra
termininal on the starter, which is for the FI and only sends out extra
juice during cranking, and ran a wire straight from that to the coil,
which helped starting immensely, especially  in Winter. Not all starters
have that terminal, and you have to be careful, because the other ones
supply voltage all the time, which means you can't use them.
