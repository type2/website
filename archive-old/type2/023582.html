&lt;&lt;Further to my query on seatbelts, swaping in a set from a Vanagon was
suggested and it seems like a good idea.  Anybody done that?

Todd,
I sell new retractable seatbelts from Mexican buses.  Unfortunately, It seems
I bought out all the belts in Mexico.  I ordered another batch, and have the
belts in, I'm just waiting for the clip ends.  You know, the part the belts
clip into.

I will post an update when I get the rest of the parts in.
