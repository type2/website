Subject: brake warning light problem

Hey y'all (from Memphis),

Last night I switched on my lights (to see in the dark) and the brake
warning light came on. It went off every time I hit the brakes. This on a
'72. My guess is that I've got some wires crossed either at the light
itself or at the brake booster. Anyone experience similar and have advice
for me?

Hopefully I'll dive into this and other problems (minor and known) tonight
after work.

Thanks! Joe
