&gt;My goof.  Already have a nickname (still looking for the right spelling), I
&gt;really meant the &quot;westy/Westfalia&quot; parts of some of the tag lines.  I know
&gt;that my baby's a Microbus, but &quot;Microbus&quot; sounds so sterile, unfeeling.
&gt;
&gt;Maybe I should have asked &quot;What's a 'westy'?&quot;?
&gt;
&gt;

Do some research, Mike.  Look at Type2_dot_com in the library and maybe even 
in the classifieds.
A Westfalia is a camper made by the Westfalia company, after the van was 
produced by VW.  Westy is short for Westfalia.
There were also Adventurewagons, which is another camper conversion 
company.  You can usually tell the difference between campers from their 
tops.  Adventurewagons mostly have a dome type top, whereas a westy has 
a flat top that &quot;pops up&quot; to make the upper bunk.  
Check around... there's lots of styles of buses, too many to list here, 
and it could be that yours is just a bus, or transporter.
