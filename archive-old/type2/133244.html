&gt; Perfect location---Pretty part of the country--

well using Cookeville for my planning (not sure how close that is but)
MapQuest says I 632miles away and they jokingly say 10 hours driving
mostly on I-81,  ROTFLMAO  not in a VW bus, not even one showroom new,
but within range..

&gt; This could be a doable thing---but there has to be more than enough
&gt; participants, and no junk yard dogs--this is supposed to be a paint fest
&gt; right?
&gt;
&gt; All we need is some electricity--a decent compressor that can keep up

well I have a 3000 watt generator and a medium sized compressor,  would
run one or two sanders or a paint gun but not multiples.

&gt; with stereo or quadraphnic DA sander's and my paint guns-- a off the
&gt; beaten path place to do this--and bodies.

well count this body and his 78 auto tranny bus in if we can get the
schedule worked out right..
