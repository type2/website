Subject: Re: [T2] VW Trends follies

I have found VWT to be a very poor produced magazine.  They mix up pictures
and captions.  Many photos are have terrible, blurry, etc.  Content is
filled with conflicting and/or inaccurate information.  Many typos and
grammar mistakes.  If it were not for the appealing subject matter, I would
never touch another one.  I am grateful, however, that there this magazine
exists.  It appears to me that they lack an editor.  I would suppose that
the company that produces it just does not pay for the editing that it
sorely needs.  My message is, look at and enjoy the pictures, just don't
believe all that you read.
