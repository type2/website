Subject: Re: [T2] Why VW buses die


&gt;
&gt;In the glove box, we found a receipt for service from a tractor repair 
&gt;company. Remember, this is northern Idaho. Probably not many good VW 
&gt;mechanics for hire up there. We heard it was driven in, making a helluva 
&gt;racket. D'ya think?
&gt;A friend just came out from Kansas for a wedding. His mom had a Westy 
&gt;pop-top camper until it blew the engine, and they couldn't find a good VW 
&gt;mechanic out there, so sold it for a song. Neither could work on it and 
&gt;had no tools. Luckily, someone bought it who knew how to work on VWs or 
&gt;was willing to learn, and they still see it running up and down the roads 
&gt;out there. But it seems that's what it takes.. These are tinkerers cars. 
&gt;They'll take a lot of abuse, but they need someone who understands 
&gt;air-cooled engines. A lot of buses would still be on the road today if not 
&gt;for their drivers and ignorant or sloppy mechanics.    Jan B

These are the very reasons anyone who owns a vintage car - anything not 
mainstream - should learn to do their own repairs. There are alot of crummy 
mechanics who think they know about Volkswagens. I would say very few 
common mechanics are qualified to work on a vintage VW these days. I also 
own a Honda and that too will never see the inside of a mechanic's garage 
b/c so many are hacks...

Buy some tools, buy a few good books, and learn. It will be cheaper than 
any mechanic and a much better quality in the long run. Learn how to not be 
a hack.

Fix them, don't sell them. It's cheaper to fix a blown engine than &quot;give&quot; 
away your VW.

Otherwise you are stuck driving a car payment the rest of your life.
