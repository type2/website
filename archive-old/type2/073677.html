&gt;&gt; with my .009 and 34pict3 set up. &gt; What\Where is this hole in the throttle plate on the carb that I am &gt; supposed to plug up. &gt; John Baker,Remove the carb and turn it over. The air bleed hole that you want to plug is about 3/32&quot; dia. located just off center in the round brass plate(throttle plate or butterfly). By plugging this hole, all of the air at idle is forced through the idle circuits. This enables a better transition to the high speed circuits in the carb -- helping to eliminate the hesitation.You will need to reset your carb after plugging this hole! A great procedure for this can be found at:http://www.w-p-c_dot_com/buggy34-3adjust.htmI do agree with with John Connolly though, the 009 distributor is not well suited for street use. A dual advance distributor(vacuum and centrifugal) will give you better driveability, and fuel economy. Even if you can't find the absolute correct distributor for your application, there are many out there that are very close. Any of those, properly set up, would be better than the 009.-- Sten Bedwell (longtime lurker)
