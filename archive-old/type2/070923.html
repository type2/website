hello eveyone

 Today despite the fact that it's snowing ( a rarity here ) Ive had the air
cleaner out. And as usual some things are confusing me.  I have 'Keeping your
VW alive', the Haynes manual and the Bently manual but none cover it in enough
detail.

The engine is an AS in a 1600 1971 van, I dont think that effects the air
cleaner, just a larger flywheel.  The air cleaner does have a small counter
weighted flap near the oil bath end of the snout (crankcase fumes?) but the
small pipe next to it is open and completely unconnected, should this be piped
to the small pipe next to the oil filler?

This weighted flap doesnt have any facility for connecting to the bellows
thermostat by cable (nor does it have any mounting nearby for the cable end),
from what he books have said, I should expect then to find a second thermostat
on the side of the air snout. This is not the case, the snout from above is
completely straight whereas the ones shown in the books have a sort of
shoulder nearest the oil bath to which the thermostat is fixed.

Even stranger is a sort of 'blob' fixed in place by a wire clip between the
air intake and the warm air hose. This blob has a hose going from it to the
oil bath lower half. Looking inside the snout, I can see that the blob
protrudes slightly inside. Is this mysterious blob a different thermostat or
some kind of filter for fumes?

Anyway, I have answered one question today...the previous owner DID keep the
oil bath filled correctly ( he had to do something right!) but I have an
unused outlet, and no recognisable thermostat!  let me know what you think,
the bus and I will be very gratefull.

The reason for all this work is that in three months I'm off around Europe for
half a year and dont fancy overheating out there. Thanks again,

Adam
