You might just get a &quot;bulk head fitting&quot; that is barbed on each side.
These have threads and a nut on them that will lock them to the sheet
metal, then you attach your fuel line to each side.


&gt;Greetings to the Esteemed List,
&gt;
&gt;I was wondering if there was any kind soul out there in Listland who might
be
&gt;willing to share one of Bob Hoover's sermons with me.  I'm referring
&gt;specifically to the one covering the making of a fuel line protector for
the
&gt;spot at which the fuel line passes through the engine tin.  I remember
seeing
&gt;this a few years ago.  I checked the Library and both George and Jerry
&gt;(excellent articles!) make casual reference to this little device.  I
believe
&gt;lamp parts were an essential ingredient in the recipe.
&gt;At the very least, I have to change the fuel line.   It looks like it was
&gt;last attended to during the Carter administration.  And I'd like to take
care
&gt;of that &quot;sore spot&quot; at the engine tin.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks all!
&gt;
&gt;Mike
&gt;
