Subject: Re: [T2] Spare tire hold down?



&gt; After sweating over body and painbt for several months, I decided to 
move my
&gt; spare off the nose, where is dented the sheet metal, and into its 
original
&gt; location.  I got the two little rubber bumpers that bolt to the wall, 
and
&gt; the plastic tire cover.  But isn't there something that holds the 
wheel up
&gt; against the wall?  I haven't seen anything in my hunting.

There is a nylon strap that goes through the loop on the wall, over the 
top of the tire, and through the center hole of the tire.  There is a 
plastic piece that protects the nylon from the center hole of the rim, 
and a metal buckle to tighten the whole thing down.  You could 
duplicate this setup functionally with common nylon webbing and a 
plastic buckle.
