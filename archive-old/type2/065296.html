to which I say......I too had a glass filter.  Loved it. Could see the
filter status and fuel flow.  The down side is exactly what you feared, a
fire hazard.  The glass is sealed with o-rings on each end which will deform
under high heat and leak.  
Heave it and heave it now.

The little clear plastic ones are little better.  I had a bug I bought after
a fire and noted that the little plastic filter melted into a puddle.

Now running ugly metal filter and feel better when I drive.
