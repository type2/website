Subject: Hydraulic System Bleeding

Just when you all thought this bleeding thread had died..........

In the aviation industry, they use pressure bleeders that fill from the
slave cylinder end; also have a connection at the master cylinder end for
handling overflow from the reservoir.  This information comes from a skilled
friend who is a commercial-airline pilot, able craftsman, old airplane
restorer.....  all 'round good guy.  He says the hydraulic systems of
aircraft need to be very tight and bubble-free, and bleeding from the slave
end is preferred practice.

This idea might not work as well on autos, where the wheel cylinders seem to
accumulate most of the rust and dirt...... but it would be easy to fabricate
this kind of pressure bleeder.  For someone who keeps his/her hydraulic
system clean, it may be an opportunity?   Any thoughts?   (Jason: your
father may have ideas on this.)

Enjoy Saturday ----
