Subject: dizzy wizardry mystery partially solved

thanks listees for helping out with my squirming distributor doing its own
base jumping thing. i tweeked the dizzy clamp for about 20 minutes in my
vice so that it mated perfectly well with the engine case. thanks for
concern and thoughts. not sure yet whether i need to shim the drive gear,
just have to see i suppose.  fweem dreams  - steve
