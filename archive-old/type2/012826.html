I'm assuming this is the reason the junk yard gave me a 'new' fuel tank to put in with the fuel injection set-up? The FI tank has two gas lines. The old carbed model fuel tank has only one.  Is that what this is for?  Since the engine is being pulled and replaced I figured I'd better have the full FI set-up.

Peace,
