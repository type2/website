Subject: Re: [T2] 2.0 Type IV Rebuild 

&gt; 1. Does all of this sound right to you?

i am NOT an authority, but i have been doing my homework lately, and i'm
building a motor which is almost EXACTLY the same specs as yours, down to
the cam grind.

&gt; 2. What is the best way to arrive at compression ratio from deck height?

there is pretty good stuff in the type2_dot_com library for this, including
links to an excel spreadsheet for the final calculations. the important step
is to measure the combustion chamber accurately. once this is done, it is
just plugging in the deck height, chamber size, bore and stroke to get the
CR.

&gt; 3. Can you think of anything I am missing here?

maybe one little niggly one - the case plugs on the BACK of the motor (oil
pump side) should also be done.

good luck,

scott lyons
