David,

Here ar ethe ones I know:

#1: That's the decel valve  It controls the rte at wich your engine
    decelerates.

#2, 3, 4 (black hose)  that goes to an elbow on  the aux air valve.  The
aux air valve is at the right rear corner of the air dist box, attached to
the engien block.  It has a short lenght of hose on one end attaching it
to the air dist box, the other will have an elbow and this hose attaches
to that elbow.

#2,3,4 (green hose)  This hose routs crankcase gases from the EGR box (at
the rear of the engine) back into the intake to be burned.  it should
obviously not be loose.  Gettign the proper diameter hose in the US is
damn near impossible, tho.  Clamps are not good, but the best bet here.

#5 This is part of the charcoal canister system to recirculate gas vapor
from the gas tank.  It is sopposed to have one of the lines from the
charcoal cnister attached to it.  The other line attaches to the right
side of the fan shroud.

#6 Yes.  *IF* this is the - or 1 terminal, then it gets the green wire
from the condensor on the distributor.

#7  I have never seen a hole and gasket in a filler cap...  maybe a DPO
had a dipstick sender installed there?

#8&amp;9  You have me, I don't know

Whee!!! that was fun!!!  send more pics!!!! :-)
