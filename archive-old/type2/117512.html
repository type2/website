&gt; I have a 78 stock motor automatic trans westy.

&gt; existing motor as a doner.

no there are some differences between the auto and manual tranny hookup

.the flex plate would have to be swapped for a flywheel, and this REQUIRES
setting the end play

. the starters are different

. the accelerator linkages are different

. not a biggie but the ECU and Decel valves are different (get from donor
bus)

it's late that is all I can think of at the moment, wanna sell your
auto tranny??
