Sorry for the apparent confusion in my original post.  Judging from
multiple replies many of you seem to have though that I have a functional
EGR and just decided to disconnect it. Actually I have a '79 bus with a
EMPI dual exhaust coming right off my heat exchangers.  Just recently I
found out what an EGR was and that I don't have one.  The pipe that would
lead to its location if the filter was present is just busted off right
where it goes through the cooling tin.

Thanks for the replies though. I will no go make something to stop that
vaccumm leak I have unknowingly been driving with for the last 600 miles
since I disconnected the EGR valve swith from the throttle arm.

No viscous desire to pollute present here.  Just an old bus with only some
if its parts present.

Anybody desiring me to change this can just mail me the appropriate EGR,
crossover pipe, and exhaust system.  I doubt I'll ever spend the money to
recreate this system. Sorry.

Thanks,
