Subject: Re: [T2] Parts sent: Westy Tow?

&gt;From: Access Systems yup, hauled my 78 from Richmond to Baltimore without a 
&gt;problem, the bigger
&gt;the truck the easier the haul in my opinion.  I used a 4 wheel trailer.

&gt;Bob


Thanks Bob that was going to be my next question. 4 wheel or 2 wheel with 
axles removed.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
