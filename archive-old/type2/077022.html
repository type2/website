&gt;VW afficianados,
&gt;A friend of mine recently took her 78 westy to the shop and they 
&gt;attributed the majority of her oil leaks to the oil pressure switch not 
&gt;being torqued in enough. what kind of oil pressure does a 2.0 L generate? 
&gt;this is not urgent, i am just curious how much pressure would be pushing 
&gt;upwards towards that switch and the threads that hold it in?

Probably no more than 70-80psi when the engine is cold.  The shop could be 
correct, as the pipe threads in the oil pressure switch fitting are tapered 
and rely on torque to make a seal.  I would be very careful about 
overtorquing though, as this one would be a bear to fix if the threads 
stripped or the sender snapped off.
