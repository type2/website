Subject: Re: What's the biggest box y

OK - technically I don't qualify 'cause I have a bunker burner Vanagon, but:

Swing set?  mine came with a 12' top &quot;beam&quot; in the form of a single steel tube
, all in a long relatively skinny box, 12' + long.

Also carried home on seperate occasions, without significant problem, 12 X 20'
roll of carpet, a bunch of  14' 2 X 6s, a dishwasher brought home behind the
3rd seat because all the others were full of family,  a plastic &quot;play fort&quot;
that came in two HUGE carboard boxes that would have filled the bed of a full
size pick up truck (took the pieces out of the boxes and managed to fit all
pieces from both boxes into the back of the van, assorted sofas . . .

Bob's closing comment -&quot;I was also impressed that the *(_at_#^$% swing set was
harder to assemble than the bus!&quot; is greatly claified by his signature line: 
&quot;Programmer at large&quot; - 
waddya 'xpect from a s/w wienny???     :-)
