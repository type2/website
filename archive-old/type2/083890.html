Subject: Undercarriage storage and tinware

Two questions, one email:

1. Has anyone tried fabbing an undercarriage storage compartment? There's
tons of room under there and it would be nice to keep my jack stands, jack,
tools, spare parts outside of the bus.

2. On my '74 with the original 1.8l, I am missing the two bottom-most
pieces of tinware - the ones that make sure the air coming from the fan
gets blown across the heads. Because of this, I have been running with my
thermostat disconnected. Does anyone have a lead on these two pieces of
tinware? pmail if possible.

Thanks!
-Eric
