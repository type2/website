Bryan,

I got a good chuckle out of this post.  I haven't done this, but it does
sound like something I would do.  It's a great idea.

So now to think of some obscure thing that my local VW dealer definitely
would not have for a  76 Bus.  And if I ever get ahold of the mexican Bus at
my work, well that opens up a whole 'nuther bunch of fun.

&gt;Hello all,
&gt;The recent notice to local vw guy Metwizard by VWOA got me thinking. I know
&gt;that it is within VWs legal right to protect their trademarks so this is
not
&gt;another gripe. What i suggest is a constant 'counter attack' on our part.
&gt;This is something that I already do myself, just for fun. Does anyone
&gt;remember the ads that VW put in VW Trends and Hot VW showing a bug next to
a
&gt;jetta? It says to keep it real , buy genuine VW parts.  I started  going
&gt;into the dealerships around here asking for the front apron for my 71
&gt;squareback , or the treasure chest doors for my 68 single cab , the front
&gt;turn signal lights on my 62 single cab as well as other things, Of course
&gt;the answer was that it was no longer available.  My point was that i was
&gt;responding to VW ads and to just pester them.
&gt;If we all ,the internet vdubers as well as the rest of the community , call
&gt;or go in person to ask about air cooled parts perhaps vwoa or at least
local
&gt;dealerships and their staff would be more inclined to &quot;look the other way&quot;
&gt;or maybe even start selling some of the stuff that is made south of the
&gt;border or in dusty dealer storage rooms.
&gt;
&gt;just a thought
