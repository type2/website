Subject: Re: [T2] Motor changes for the bus

Well I've got to say that yes the buses have &quot;fragile&quot; handling at highway 
speeds and if you add a bunch of power and speed you ought to consider some 
better brakes, sway bars and 15&quot; tires with a better load rating.

I too am not seeking much speed - just enough power to keep up with the 
modern highway traffic. That 4 banger makes enough power for the back roads 
b/c you can slow down and go to third if you need to without getting run 
over by semi-trucks running 85 mph.

Do us a 911 conversion. I want to hear all about it. I would do one in a 
heartbeat but I don't have that kind of budget and a refined Corvair 110 
will do everything I need to make a VW bus do.
