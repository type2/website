First post, so, sorry for the length.

I recently purchased a stock 78 bus. 2.0L Fuel injected.
Compression tested well, ran OK, clearly a project, but the body and interior was in Fair+ shape.  
Tuned it up last week - new plugs, points, rotor, cap, condenser, wires, (did not replace the coil) - set idle, dwell and timing to spec's,  - needs a muffler, but runs well.
Changed oil, installed correct new oil filter, air filter.
Found the engine has no seal in the compartment, and the fan that blows down into the (heat exchangers) - I think, it's been 15 years since my last bus), missing the in-line fuse.  Installed fuse, and it works.
 
Two miles into it's test drive, it quits.  Going thirty-five, motor just cuts out - no flickering lights, nothing.  
Try to restart it and no luck; plenty of battery, spins like a top.  Spend about fifteen minutes of pulling wires, etc.  Was not getting spark from the main coil lead.  Try everything I know two miles from home with no tools, (all right, more like ten minutes), prepare to walk home and decide to try one more time, and Bang, fires right up.  Continue about three more miles and she quits again.  This time, without touching anything, she fires back up after waiting about half an hour.  Get almost home and she quits again.  Walk home get a ride back to the Bus, ( 30 minutes or so pass) and she fires right up.  Happened again today the same way.  
 
When I drove the bus home the day I bought it, and it ran OK, the main Vacuum advance hose was not connected - it is now, and timed accordingly and runs great at 7.5 btd - when it runs!
 
I'm looking for ideas on where to start. Could this be caused by a bad new condenser, or, could the coil be in the process of failing?  Could it be a bad vacuum advance/distributor?  I removed the distributor when I replaced and set the points, and the advance seemed sticky - hard to move, hard to return, BUT, the timing mark moved perfectly under the timing light. 
 
Last problem - and responses to this will determine how much time and money to dedicate to the balance of this project.  
While inspecting the vehicle in my driveway in the full light of day, I find that the two large brackets that hold the lower front axle beam to the frame, are almost completely rusted away. (Axle beam look ok) It appears that the driver side is rusted all the way through, and the passenger side is starting.  Will/Can this (need to) be replaced?  It seems to be a big project, but the rest of the bus is in decent shape.  Could I have someone weld some bracketing for the beam to the inside of the existing brackets?
 
Thanks for any help!
