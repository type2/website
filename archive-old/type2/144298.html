Subject: email addresses on web pages

Just an FYI to everyone on the list, especially those
who are putting up web pages showing bus stuff etc -

It's good practice never to put your email address in
plain text on a web page. unscrupulous spam companies
have software that visits web pages and sucks up all
these email addresses automatically, and adds them to
spam lists.

One way around this is to write it out long-hand,
something like:

myname AT mydomain DOT com

or to create a GIF image of your email address and use
that isntead, so it's not machine readable. Same goes
for mailto: links in HTML code

Of course, if you really like getting email offers for
v^iagr^a and pen15 enlargement, go for it ;-)

cheers
