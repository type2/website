Subject: volts &amp; ohms &amp; sliders

To Bill in Portland. Glad my write up was of use to you. Was
nice of you to say so. Thanks!(that write up is also on my site)
  On the other hand... my slider cable got kinked and now the
roof is inoperative &lt;sigh&gt;... any source for cable out there?
(I hear laughing way off in the distance) anyway would be nice to fix
my roof for the summer! Orrrr can I remove the cable system and slide
it by hand... of course installing a latch for when it is closed....
anybody done that with success? Or.... maybe just bag
the whole slider and adapt one of those splitty pop tops to cover the
hole... any thoughts?  Thanks!
