Subject: RE: [T2] gauge and carb questions

What? No they are down at 0 before you crank it. The guage is functioning
but there is no pressure. the gauges functioning has nothing to do with
the engine running or not once the gauges are powered they read.


&gt; All of the VDO oil pressure gauges I have seen do this when they first
&gt; come on and you havent cranked the engine.
&gt; Once you crank it it should start reading the correct pressure.

&gt;
&gt; In hooking up my VDO oil pressure gauge, the needle pegs anytime it gets
&gt; +12V.  Is this a bad gauge?  I now have 2 that do this.  Has anyone else
&gt; experienced this?
&gt;
