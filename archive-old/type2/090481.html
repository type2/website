&gt; Need a little memory help here.  Checking the basic timing of this 2
&gt; litre engine.  When we are at tdc (#1) which cylinder and valve do we
&gt; check to see if this is the power or intake stroke?  (Which valve on
&gt; which cylinder will have just closed? &gt;or opened&lt;)

If you're turning the engine clockwise, the intake of #1 will close 1/2
engine revolution before TDC on #1.  The exhaust valve will open 1/2
revolution after TDC.
