Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel pump question

&gt; I probably wouldn't run a return line either but keep your testing

Well, Richard came over yesterday and helped me test my pump (thanks, 
Richard!)

Interestingly enough, the new pump was *somewhat* noisy running from a 
gas can, as well.  But it was definitely noisier when run from the 
tank.  When run from can, the slight noise didn't show up until the 
fuel rail came up to pressure (with engine off, AFM operated manually, 
fuel pressure gauge read ~38-40).  I guess it's the ball bearings 
inside the pump?  Is this sound normal with the new Bosch pumps?

We also tested the old pump (ran it with two gas cans).  The old pump, 
when it did not have any outlet pressure to speak of (i.e. no FPR), 
made a normal whirring sound.  I guess it only gets noisy when it comes 
up to pressure, too?

Anyway, I have pretty much resigned to dropping the engine, pulling the 
tank, and inspecting/cleaning the outlet.  I'm going to have to have 
the shop do it, since I don't have a place (or the free weekends, 
unfortunately) to do this, and that means a tow, grumble.  I am going 
to also replace my filler neck elbow with a federal type (if I can find 
one) to eliminate the possibility of breaking off another chunk of that 
!_at_#_at_$^ bird-beak.
