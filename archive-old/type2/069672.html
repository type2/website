Subject: Re: Clutch probs 75 Kombi

ou can drive it without the clutch- just slip into neutral and &quot;feel&quot; the
gear by playing with the gas pedal.  Stopping is easy in neutral, but
starting requires you to turn off key, slip into 1st, and turn starter to
lurch forward.  Used this for broken clutch cables and sticking pilot
bearings...
