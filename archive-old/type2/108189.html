&gt; IF you'll read the comment: &quot;What's next, a charge to take our money to
the bank.&quot;
&gt; I was referring to the guy who said he actually had to drive a product to
the shipping center.

That was me. :O)

The weekly trip to various shipping centers comes out of the company's
budget; it isn't free.  I can either divide it up between each customer's
shipping costs, or I can increase the retail price on my products.  Either
way, it comes out of the customer's pocket, just like in any other business,
brick and mortar or mail-order.
