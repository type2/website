Subject: [T2] oil filler tube needed pronto 

Volks- I need an oil filler tube for a type4 engine (1800). I guess it
cracked or something and the PO had it fixed somehow, but now it's
leaking again. No one I could find sells them, so I need one off of an
old engine. I'm supposed to leave for a  long trip in two weeks, and I
can't go without this part. 
A BIG THANKS goes out to all of you who helped me solve the mystery of my
leaking oil gallery plug. I pulled it out and tapped it just a few
minutes ago.  I used a 3/8 inch pipe tap and end to seal it up. One thing
that no one mentioned to me, but was important, was to drill out the hole
with a 9/16 or better yet, a 37/64 inch bit BEFORE you begin to tap.
There is a lip that the plug rests on inside of the case, and when your
tap hits it, it won't bite into it, it just strips out the threads you
have already tapped. Ask me how I know. Fortunately, there was enough
meat after that part that I was able to get a good solid thread.  Oh, and
if you really expect to do this without getting any small metal shavings
in the oil passages, think again. I did the best I could, but I think I
left some microscopic sized pieces of metal in there. Fortunately I'm due
for an oil change, so I'll run the engine for a few minutes to get the
shavings down in the sump, or better yet, in the filter, and then change
the oil and filter. Thanks again to all who responded. I love this list.
