Thanks for the great info.
I'll look into it, wire it up like you list and see what happens.


Now, how about all those Vacuum hoses?
Anyone have a good diagram for a 72?

Thanks!

&gt; I hate to say it, but the wireing that the PO had is most likely
stock, or
&gt; just a copy of stock. All the Buses I have had this is how it was
wired.
&gt; Form the coil, to the choke to the jet, to the..... in one big loop.
It uses
&gt; the power from the coil to power all those little things on the
carbs. It is
&gt; the same on Bugs, they just have less stuff. What I do on all mine
is to
&gt; pull the wire off the coil and run it to a relay. Then I run a lead
from the
&gt; battery to the realay and I power it by the + lead on the coil. This
way
&gt; when you turn on the key power goes to the coil and just to the
relay, the
&gt; relay then gets power from the battery to power all that stuff. I
also use a
&gt; relay for the coil on some. I do this so that the coil gets full
12vdc from
&gt; the battery and does not have to travel over 20ft of old wires to
get to the
&gt; coil, just 2ft from the battery and one relay. If you need a diagram
I can
&gt; send you one.
