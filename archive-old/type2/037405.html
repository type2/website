Subject: automatic ring and pinion

Hi Volks,

I don't add to much to the list, just read and learn, but I have a question
(archives turned up nothing).

I'm going to be getting my '74 going for my daugters 16th b-day. The big
prob I've got is the final drive on the automatic. The ring and pinion are
lunched. I do know the cause but to embarrassed to talk about the lack of
fluid. Are the ring and pinion the same part as in the sticks? Just looking
for a little info before I start my search. I'll be going out shortly to
look for part numbers.

Thanx everyone!
