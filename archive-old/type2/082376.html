Subject: [T2] Used engin for a 72 Westy


Hey

I bought my first VW a few months ago, then promptly
blew the engine!  I really want to find a cheap used
engine I can put in the van until I can afford to have
the original engine rebuilt.  Does anyone have a used
engine or a source for a cheap used engine.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks

Michael
