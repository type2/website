&lt;&lt; Someone commented that a Bus would probably produce as much pollution as a
 new V8 Jeep.  I think that the Bus would be much worse.  Has anyone done an
 emissions test of their Bus and compared it to new vehicles?  I imagine
 that the newer FI catalyst-equipped busses would fare best, but it seems
 that pollution control technology has come a long way since they were new.
 
 That Honda commercial hits home to a guy who wants to be environmentally
 friendly.  Can the Bus be modified to run cleaner?

I'm sitting on my hands here.  They're trying to get to the keyboard, but I'm 
keeping them down with considerable effort.  And I know I'll get flamed.
