Subject: indian busses 

If you read in that hardcover bus book, the 50-79 picture book, it shows lots of pics of busses from around the world that they shipped in &quot;CKD&quot; &quot;completely knocked down&quot; form.

Those indian busses are front engined I believe.

VW gave them some major pieces and they built the buses themselves out of crates.
