Subject: Kadrons w/ 009

Can anyone with my set-up - 1600dp w/ 009 and dual kadrons - no choke
please tell me whether they experience the same things that I do - I find that
the bus requires pretty heavy rev's to move as well as when changing gears -
if not it feels as though it is chugging then finally smoothes out
Really hard to start when cold ( 19 degrees today )and when I get it started
it has to warm up for quite a while (15 mins )- if you touch the gas it acts
as if it going to stall
I have the 009 timed to 7.5 btdc 32 total - when I first got it was timed to
43 total but seemed a whole lot smoother ( 20 btdc)
Is there any reason that it could have been timed like that ? Combination of
jetting or something else- doesn't experience any of the symptoms at start-up
that I described



Eric
