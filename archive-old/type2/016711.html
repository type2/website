Subject: Type IV assembly

I have started assembly of my type IV engine.  And wouldn't you know it,

the first thing I try to do I have a question.

The rods don't have the little bumps on one side like the type I rods
do.  Is there any recommended way that they are to be installed?
Muir makes reference to the numbers at the big end being on the
same side as the bumps.  I presume I could just make sure they
are 'up' when I bolt on the rods.

Thanks in advance
