Subject: Re: [T2] Valves keep tightening up

you might get away with a new/rebuilt head if all other things are in good
shape,  a 2L engine should be good for about 150,000 at least so you
probably have a good 40k left in it.  but it does buy you some time so you
can do the rebuild on your schedule.

&gt; I need some advice..
&gt; 
&gt; Background:
&gt; 
&gt; 1977 automatic westy, 2.0 liter, Stock Fuel Injection,
&gt; 110,000 miles
&gt; History unknown except for last 3 years its been with
&gt; me.
&gt; 
&gt; Problem:
&gt; 
&gt; My Valves keep tightening up, actually just the #1
&gt; cylinder tightens to the point there is no compression
&gt; in the #1 cylinder.  Initially I thought I had a fuel
&gt; injection problem, took it to a local kansas city shop
&gt; (v-village) and they diagnosed it as above.  They
&gt; adjusted the valves and compression was over 100 in
&gt; each cylinder.  by the time I drove the vehicle home
&gt; 30 miles it was performing poorly and the shop
&gt; beleives the motor needs to be rebuilt.  OUCH !  
&gt; 
&gt; I've always known i was on borrowed time as I haven't
&gt; known the history of this motor, but I need some
&gt; advice as to where to begin.  I'd like to rebuild the
&gt; motor myself.  All suggestions welcome.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Bob
