Mark, check the backup light circuitry first. Find which fuse (might be by
itself in the engine compartment in an inline fuse holder) and take it out
of the holder. See if the engine still dies when you put it in reverse. If
it doesn't then you know you have a short in that circuit, so start tracing
back from the transmission connection till you find it.
Hope that helps,
Courtney

Hi,
 
I just bought a '74 van, and it dies when I put it into reverse gear.
Has anyone on the list had this happen to them. I am assuming it to be a
short, but not sure where.
 
Thanks,
 
Mark
