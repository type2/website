[...]

And also give the year, whether it is a Calif or Fed version, and whether it
has a manual trans or auto trans.
If it is a 76, also give the production date on the drivers B pillar.
It makes a difference if it was built up to the end of 12/75 or from 1/76 up.



&gt; I think the best thing to do would be to take some pics of exactly
&gt; what you have. Post a url to the list &amp; ask people either what exactly
&gt; you have &amp; what it looks like you are missing, then with this list you
&gt; can call/search around &amp; get prices.

&gt; &gt; So the word is stick with the injection, problem is I didnt take it out of
&gt; &gt; the last bus the guy I bought the engine from did. So we are missing
whatever
&gt; &gt; control modules and aircleaner stuff that all this FI plugs into.
Everything
&gt; &gt; that is bolted to the engine itself was there. So who might have this
extra
&gt; &gt; stuff, what is it called and how much to atain it. Can I test anything
with
&gt; &gt; it out of the vehicle and missing the control module. thanks again Dylan
