Subject: Oil everywhere (1700 Type 4)

Hi All,
     Searching the archives for
oil AND spraying AND filler
oil AND leaking AND filler

didn't yield any real answers, so I'm hoping the list can help.

I have a 1700 Type 4 engine in my bus. Just clear out of the blue, it has started dumping tons of oil, enough so that I can no longer drive it. It's everywhere on the back of the engine.

If I pull off the filler pipe cap while it's running, tremendous amounts of oil start spraying everywhere. It appears that the leak is coming from the base of the filler cap where it clamps onto the metal pipe.

All of this to say, I'm getting a lot of pressure and blowing oil from the filler pipe. I'm afraid to know what causes this. I'm thinking it might be a valve problem, but I'm not really sure. Any ideas?

Thanks, and happy Saturday (or perhaps Sunday),
John
