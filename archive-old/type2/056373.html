Subject: Need directions to Mylan show

Hi all....

Can anyone help me with directions from Detroit/Windsor for this show &amp;
help with some details...it's only a week away, &amp; I don't know how to
find the place yet....yikes...nothing like last minit planning....is
there a website or anything.._dot_comments from anyone on how big it is..

Anyone coming to the show from Chicago &amp; would be willing to bring some
paint for me from a fellow listee up that way???maybe haul a couple of
small things back to him to complete the deal....

TIA to anyone who can help...

Den...
