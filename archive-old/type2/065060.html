Subject: Phooey on HOT VW's and Westy Parts Needed

Well I've been hanging around for a few weeks as one
of those unscrupulous(sp?) lurkers, but  registered
with Uncle Joel the other day and thought I'd throw my
.02 on the Hot Vw's thread.
    At the Sacramento Bug-In 38 I was approached to
do feature articles on my 60 bus by Trends, HotVws,
and Volksworld( French Mag). The Trends guys were
really cool and said they'd work around my Schedule
as I was planning on starting home(500mi away), right
after the show, and the Volksworld guys were also
very accomidating(sp?) but the Hot Vw guys said they
were interested but only if it was exclusively shot by
them and on ther time schedule. &quot;Maybe some time
tomorrow we could fit you in&quot; Fit me in ?  They're are
making money off my car in there mag,  what a bunch
of _at_#%#  !! Anyway look for my bus in TRENDS &amp;
VOLKSWORLD but not HOT VWS &amp; BTB's  BTW
there are no babes in either of the shoots (Kathy).
Look for it to hit the Mags after the 1st of the year.
P.S. good call Ric on the make up of the list vs
DB&amp;HVWS readership
