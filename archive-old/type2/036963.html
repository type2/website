Subject: Dual carb type IV questions

A couple of questions that I want to ask after trying to get
a good tuneup on my PDSIT carbed type IV. This is a new
engine to me, so I dont know its previous tuneup history
or much about it in general. I am a 34 PICT 3 man.

1) I adjusted the air control on the left all the way closed
in order to drop the idle down to 1000 rpm. I cant get
it to go slower. Where should I look next? Could the 
butterflies not be all the way closed? If I unscrew it even
1 turn the rpm goes to 1800. The carbs are balanced at idle,
so says the uni-syn and the floating ball is rock steady.

2) Does anyone make a replacement hot air thermostat
vacuum unit? I can suck air through mine all day and
it wont bring hot air up from underneath. I didnt see 
a specific VW number on the unit, nor did the 
number from the fiche match anything on busdepot_dot_com.
All I need is the vacuum can, even a used one that was
good would be nice.

3) What is the size of the vacuum hose that is used to seal 
all of the idle balance tubes and other 'large' vacuum pipes
on the engine? I want to get the right stuff. There must be
a dozen 2 inch sections in there.

Thanks,
