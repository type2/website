Subject: Tune up woes solved!

Thanks to everyone who tried to help me with my tune up problem.  It
turned out to be something very simple: the parts shop sold me the wrong
spark plugs!  A mechanic friend of ours came over and put the old plugs
back in and it runs fine.  Being new to this game, I didn't know I was
supposed to get the plugs by number, I just said I wanted Bosch plugs
for my 78 bus and figured that was good enough info. Oh well, live and
learn.  I am going back tomorrow to get the RIGHT plugs and will attemp
to put them in BY MYSELF my next day off.  I am trying to view all this
as a learning experience...Beth and the 78 Hippychickmobile in NJ
