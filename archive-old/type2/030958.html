&gt; well at the very leat I need a valve job on my 74 bus Automatic w/fuil

&gt; valves and maybe find out the engine also needs a rebuild for another 1k.
&gt; Or do I just go buy a rebuild and drop it in?

do neither, find someone who does know how to rebuild ?1.8 liter engines
and get him to work together with you and rebuild the engine with the best
materials, take your time and learn as you go.

so what if you have to pay him something, you pay tuition at school
