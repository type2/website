Subject: RE: [T2] Westy Seating Question

The early baywindow and Riviera interiors are great for camping but quite useless for &quot;regular life&quot; IMHO - trips to the store and trips to the junkyard. I like the ability to put fairly large objects inside my '78 Westy. I've hauled (with no damage to the bus) engines, washer and then a dryer on a second trip, chairs, transmissions, etc. It's not a HUGE quantity but it has been useful when I didn't want to bring my 5x8 utility trailer along (when it rains and swap meet finds usually happen when I don't have a trailer along...).
