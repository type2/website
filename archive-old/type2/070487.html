&gt; Praise the lord that you didn't cut the bumper!!! :)  Bus exhaust is not _that_ much  more I don't know
&gt; why people were so willing back in the old days to sacrifice rear bumpers to save a few $$
&gt; 
&gt; straight original bumpers are becoming more of a precious commodity, between people hacking them
&gt; for beetle exhausts and fender benders there are not a lot of staight ones left
&gt; 
&gt; Out of curiosity, what years typically had to have the bumper cut to fit
a beetle exhaust? When I put the bumper back on my '71 after having the 
enigine out and installing a new beetle exhaust, it fit just right. 
Granted I did have to install just the bumper brackets first and then
the bumper. The bumper fits just above the exhaust tips without touching.
Sound about right?
