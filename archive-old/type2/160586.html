&gt; Needless to say, between exceptionally long times
&gt; for
&gt; shipping and poor communication, I am very
&gt; disappointed in Bus Depots customer service. I still
&gt; plan on purchasing things from them here and there,
&gt; but at this point, I would rather give my money to
&gt; Chris at Busted Bus. At least he replies to personal
&gt; emails in a reasonable amount of time.&lt;&lt;

I'm not trying to stir things up or anything, but
didn't you just ask this question yesterday??  If so,
you really should give a person\business at least a
day to respond before you start slamming them in public...
