Anti-seise copound is not a good idea! IT acts as a heat barrier and your plugs 
run hotter.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;I have heard, though, that platinum plugs will stick in cylinder heads and
&gt; &gt;&gt; will become nigh on impossible to remove.  (They last tens of thousands of
&gt; &gt;&gt; miles (in a healthy engine)&gt;&gt;

&gt; I use an anti-sieze lubricant on all sparks plugs, everytime.  Why risk any
&gt; plug thread problems at all?  Any plug does seem get more stuck when they've
&gt; been overheated, but that may or may not have been the fault of the plug
&gt; (probably not).  I've got the platinums W8AP (stock temp) and they have run
&gt; beautifully so far and I believe helped pass smog.
