Subject: [T2] Splitting T4 cases.. a little progress


&gt; I found the 20th fastener; the one under the oil cooler. Now I can get a
&gt; start on splitting. At the flywheel end, I can get it open 0.5mm using a lead
&gt; hammer; t the &quot;tabs&quot;, maybe 0.2mm. However, at the crank nose, nothing. I
&gt; can't even show a crack in the hardened grease at the parting line.
&gt;
&gt; Any tricks for this bit?

Remove the oil pump.
