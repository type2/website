Subject: Re: [T2] Installing interior wood panels

to install my interior panels i used the button type clips that are used
throughout a stock westy's rear section.  they work great on the front door
panels also and allow you to use the stock holes in all 3 doors and the
rear hatch.  the only thing you must make sure of is that the holes are
relatively lined up between the wood and the doors unlike the stock covered
door panels.  it makes for a very clean install and allows you to remove
the panels as necessary.  they can be got cheap at the junk yard or i'm
sure one of our vendors sells them or even an auto upolstery or maybe an rv
shop.  i used wood on all my door panels to give it a surfer look and
because you can't beat making 2 door panels for 7$.
