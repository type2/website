I found a bought a stock 1600cc engine from a guy on eBay a few days ago 
(also comes with a tranny) I will go to get it in the next few weekends. I am 
only paying a couple of hundred for all this. I would like some opinions on 
this info (seem fair??) Thanks

BTW...how do you think it will fit in my Jetta A3. with the seats down?
