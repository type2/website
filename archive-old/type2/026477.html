Subject: RE:  Water Temp Gauge as Oil Temp Gauge?
Date: Tue, 23 Mar 1999 10:05:24 -0600

&gt;Wally World (Walmart for the uninitiated) has water temp gauges, 
&gt;complete with sender, for the LOW LOW price of $10.  And it 

Using a water temp for oil temp is no problem as long as the gauge will show
temps from at least 100 up to at least 300 degrees Fahrenheit.  I'm using a
water temp gauge from a Porsche 924 in my 73 Westy and it works just fine.

&gt;-Am I whizzing into the wind?

That's something I'd rather not see!

&gt;What I'm really wondering about is clearance if used in the sump 
&gt;plate. There doesn't seem to be much.

The new VDO sender kit I got for the type1 motor in my 58 has instructions
for mounting it in the sump plate.  Apparently you drill an appropriate hole
in the plate, stick the sender through the hole with a washer and attach it
with a nut on the other side.  I haven't yet done this.  Mostly due to being
chicken-sh#t and partly due to not having 4 or 5 spare plates to destroy
(usually take me several tries on something like this) and finally due to no
having a drill bit big enough.
