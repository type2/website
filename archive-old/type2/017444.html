Subject: Re: How do I clean out my Gas Tank???
References: &lt;36F8653D.6D5D_at_pacbell_dot_net&gt;

Remove all the gasoline from the tank before you attempt to remove it
from the van.  Just logical that it weighs less.
Once out, fill it with water and a little dish detergent to get as much stuff

out as possible.  Drain and rinse.  Set it out in the sun to warm up and dry.

If you can see inside the tank, look for any signs of rust.  If there are
some,
do the following:
1. Get some lengths of small chain and put them in the tank.  Pick up the
tank and shake it has hard as you can to rattle the chain around the inside.
That will knock off some of the rust scale.  Now, go to a paint store and
find a liquid rust stopper called OSPHO, or PHOSGO.  This is a chemical
that seals the rust and transforms it into something else.  I can't remember
all the terms right now but it works.  Pour the bottle in the tank and shake
it around.  Let it set for an hour and pour the liquid back out.  (Save it,
it can be used on other rusted areas.).  If you can't find it locally, it is
available from the folks that sell POR15.

If there are rust holes in the tank, either buy the gas tank repair kit from
POR15, or take the tank to a radiator repair place.  They will usually
patch the holes.

Good luck

&gt;  1) What's the procedure YOU have used? I'm new to this VW lark and
&gt; don't have the funds to get the professionals to recondition every part
&gt; of the bus. So the gas tank will be my job.
&gt;  2) Should I remove the tank with fuel in or should I do it empty? I'm
&gt; under the impression that the gasoline vapour is even more volatile than
&gt; the gas itself. What do you do?
&gt;  3) The gas gauge goes from half tank straight to zero, what should I be
&gt; looking to repair or replace to rectify this.
