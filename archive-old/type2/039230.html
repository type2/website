Subject: Re: Bad smell on compression (1971)

&gt;My 1600 DP engine, all stock, has a bad odor. When I come to the top of a
&gt;hill or if I need to slow down just by lifting my foot from the gaz pedal, a
&gt;smell of fuel and oil comes from the heat ducts. The 2 heat box are old but
&gt;tight. It never smell when the engine is propulsing me. Just when I slow
&gt;down, on the compression.

&gt;Des idées? Any clues?

This is your wake catching up with you!  Your car smells like that all the
time (tho the exhaust IS richer when you are slowing down); you just don't
smell it normally because the bus is going fast enough for the slipstream
to carry all the combustion products away. When you slow down, all that air
travelling behind the car is briefly going FASTER than you are, and comes
in the cab through heater boxes, old window seals, holes in the floor, the
open window, etcetc.

I actually use this to my advantage - I briefly slow down and sniff the
wake  from time to time; I can smell a hot engine, flooding carb, bad oil
leak and such before they bite me. With all my guages, I now just use this
method to judge whether the carb is working/jetted right. Too much gasiness
means it gets yanked and a look-see.
