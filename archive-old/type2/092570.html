&gt;Dear List,
&gt;
&gt;I have an 82 air cooled vanagon,
&gt;I believe my bearings and oil pump are worn
&gt;   Should I consider a rebuild now? or just wait until I drop a valve seat 
&gt; and then do everything at once.

Save the crank. Budget for and do a long block with uncut crank mains 
possible as soon as feasible. Do yourself a favor and pay the price for a 
proper motor from Jerry at NW ConRod in South Seattle. Add a bit more money 
and get a full engine balance for smoooooth long life.

Do not break in these motors on Castrol. Jerry has had some repeated 
failures in this instance (cams going away with new German cams). Castrol 
during break in was the only common denominator. He can consult on any 
particulars for any VW motor, air cooled or otherwise. Great place to get a 
Rabbit or Golf or Jetta motor, too, gas or diesel. Same high quality parts 
and workmanship.
