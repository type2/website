Subject: Re: [T2] Deep Cycle Battery FAQ

&gt;Interesting that to get the same cranking capacity as the stock size of
CCA battery, the deep cycle must be 20% larger- that should be easy as
&gt;we have a lot of room for changing to larger batteries.

What really got my attention was the heavy pan on sealed gel batteries.
I was just doing some research ahead of ordering an Optima when I came
across this. The solar industry seems to be pretty tuned in to deep
cycle battery technology. I've since read the same opinion in several
other places, and am now looking into AGM battery sources.
