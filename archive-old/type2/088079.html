Subject: My 2nd &amp; 3rd &quot;Westy&quot; question...

in a series of questions that I know will be long!

Question 2:  We hooked the city water up to the camper and that seemed to
work more or less OK, except the faucet &quot;off&quot; position wouldn't really turn
the water off, just &quot;down.&quot;  I know we have very high pressure where we
live, but I'd guess this should work better.  Are there any replaceable
parts inside this faucet that might fix this situation?

Question 3: According to the '81 camper supplement manual I found on the
'net there's supposed to be a vent for the internal water tank.  The manual
has a photo of it and it looks like it should be on the left side of the
van, but I can't find it!  Where the heck is the water tank vent on an '82
Westy?

As always, TIA!
