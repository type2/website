Subject: Re: [T2] 69 DC project

but I think the cost and energy
&gt;involved in a floor/frame-up resto will be quite involving.

Busses are wieird that way. Yes it will take work. You see, when the bus was 
made, they could weld this part, then weld that part and sort of like a 
sandwhich put it together.
To further this analogy, lets say you have a peanut butter and jam 
sandwhich. You find the half of it is moldy, so you order another sandwhich 
half and cut off the offending part. But how shall you put it back together? 
You can get in and reconnect the peanut butter and jelly, you can only work 
on the outside, the bread.

Ok thats simplistic, but how are you going to weld inner seams before the 
outer when you put the part in place?
Ok it can still be welded on the outside, and can be made to look as good, 
but its a lot of work, and it never will be like the factory made it.
Heres the question: How well do you weld, and are you willing to take a 
project that could eat several years (assuming you cant work on it full 
time) of your time?

On the other hand a Dual Cab was not imported to the US as far as I know, so 
it IS a rare vehicle here (relativly). The end result would be a nice thing!

So now I have said my peace and even confused you more.....good luck!
