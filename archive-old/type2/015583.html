&gt;Hi All,
&gt;Well Happy finally left me walking.  It sat for a week, ran fine before,
&gt;but last night developed a slight sputter.  This morning, the sputter
&gt;became worse and finally quit.  Upon inspection, I find the fuel filter
&gt;is dry.
&gt;I am looking for ideas of where to check first. 

First, make sure there is gas in the tank. Yes??? Blow air back through the
line. The screen at the outlet could be blocked. Still no flow. Check the
fuel pump. Still no flow? Unscrew the outlet and replace the screen. Be
sure to siphon the tank as best you can and be prepared to safely drain the
gas remaining into bucket. It goes without saying, but extinguish all open
flames in the immediate vicinity before proceeding.
