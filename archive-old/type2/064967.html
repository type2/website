&gt; &gt;With the Singlecab, I don't want to reach the point of saturation
&gt; &gt;where I can't sell it for what I have into it.
&gt; 
&gt; Then bail. Fold. Get out while you still can. Seriously, you do not do a
&gt; full resto on a car with limited collector appeal and expect to break even
&gt; or even close to even. You can get an excellent bus that somebody *else*
&gt; took a bath on for a third of what you're going to dump into that money pit
&gt; of yours.

Well I don't feel so bleak.  I'm doing 80% of this resto for my 
satisfaction in seeing my old singlecab running and looking good.  The 
resto isn't going to be perfect, but nor is it going to be a &quot;smoke 
and mirrors&quot; job.  I've already got an eventual buyer lined up for 
it, and I'll possibly recoup about $500 of my time--so I'm not feeling 
that bad...

And that brings me to another point about old VW's (or old cars in 
general).  In comparison to my '95 vehicle that's already depreciated 
$5-6k, you can't go wrong with an old car.  My '57 23-window may 
have cost me a few hundred to keep going, but it's always been 
reliable and usable and its value has increased!  My new car might be 
more comfortable and safe, but I'm paying through the nose for it!

So even if one loses $1000-2000 in an old bus, you're still doing 
better than all these guys losing BIG bucks on new cars.  

The reason I've posted about the singlecab is that I'm looking at 
it as a fun business oportunity, with a small possible monetary 
payback, and a much larger satisfaction payback.  I guess that's the 
whole reason I'm doing it, is to be satisfied in seeing an old VW 
running and looking good.  The money is a potential bonus.
