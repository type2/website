&gt; I got a reply the other day about finding TDC by removing the #1 spark plug
&gt; and 
&gt; sticking the eraser end of a pencil down the hole and whe thy piston is at
&gt; it's 
&gt; highest point you got TDC. They also mentioned something about it not being
&gt; the 
&gt; exhaust stroke? Can someone elaborate on that and how to tell if this is the
&gt; exhaust stroke or not?

Visual inspection of the valve springs under the valve cover. As you rotate
cw from TDC they will tell you whether you are starting the power stroke
(what you want) or the intake stroke.

Have you already looked at the notch on distributor?
