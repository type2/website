&gt; Not a bad idea, but the energy for the electrolysis has to come from

  BUT....  &quot;Burning&quot; hydrogen and oxygen is an extremely efficient,
hot burn.  More oxygen = more gasoline gets burned.  We're playing
with electrolysis, haven't hooked it up to any engines yet.  In theory
you should be able to get more MPG, because you're burning more
of the gasiline that goes into your engine.

  Have you looked at the efficiency of a gasoline reciprocating engine?
Only ?%15? of the available energy in the gasoline is utilized, the other
85% gets spit out the exhaust pipe.  If you inject oxygen, or maybe
even air, you should be able to burn more of the gasoline, and have
the combustion pushing harder on the piston, for a longer time during
the power stroke.
