Did you have to install a second coil, as others have described on this 
list in recent months, to get a functional signal to the FI brain?

Or did that little crossover  circuit described on the yellow handout 
from Universal do the trick?

I built the crossover circuit, but it doesn't work. I haven't got mine
working yet. I'm getting discouraged. My Universal Tiger CDI languishes 
in a cardboard box and the project it getting cold.
