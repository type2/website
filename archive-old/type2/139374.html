Yah, I am planning on calling Mallory tomorrow to ask about that.

I'm not sure the distortion of the casing is actually caused by 
&quot;melting until it's liquid&quot;... the bottom of the casing is still pretty 
stiff... I think maybe the top hatch is pressing on the casing a 
little, and thus distorting the softened plastic.

In any case, I do want to find out if it's normal for it to be that hot.
