Subject: Bus Engine Clarification

I've been a bit foggy as to what years the engines changed from the Type 
I variety to the Type IV variety.  I am taking a wild guess but it seems 
that Type I upright engines were used until 1971 and then in 1972 they 
went with the pancake engine, correct?  Thanks for clearing this up for me...
