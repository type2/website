&gt; There is a fan mounted to the dash and it

&gt; My question is how do you trace
&gt; down the problem?  Do you unplug everything or should you be able
&gt; to shut off the lights, fans, etc. and then turn each one on until you
&gt; find the problem?

If it's a short in a wire, it's usually easy to find. Turn off 
everything and attach an Ohm meter (available for under $15) to the 
removed fuse on one lead, touch the other to ground (the chasis of the 
van). If there's a short, it's a matter of tracing down the wires until 
you find the cause. If there's no short, turning on each component, one 
at a time, can give a clue. For instance, if the light switch is turned 
on and the amps suddenly exceed the fuse rating, you can guess the 
problem is in that circuit.

I would guess the fan might be the cause. Check its amp rating, and that 
of the fuse that blew. If it, plus the other loads, is greater than that 
of the fuse, then the fan will need to be wired to a different fuse. 
Another alternative is to run a heavy guage wire, with an inline fuse, 
to the fan, so it's on its own circuit.
