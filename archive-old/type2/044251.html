&gt;Subject: [T2] bucking at low throttle problem (please read)

&gt;Dear list!
&gt;I need some advice.  My '77 FI bucks as if missing when I drive with the
&gt;throttle anywhere between all the way up and floored

I had a similar problem on my '71.  It turned out to be the CV joints.  They
were a little loose and I guess it introduced just enough slack in the drive
train to let it surge, hence the bucking feeling.
