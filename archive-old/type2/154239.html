Subject: Re: [T2] Found a Westy

----- Original Message ----- 
From: &quot;Shad&quot; &lt;
&gt;
&gt; It's a '73, mostly solid, and seems to have 99.9% of the original sheet
&gt; metal on it.  There's only a few visible rust holes in it, at the back
&gt; and front corners, and underneath above the ribs in the cargo area.

&gt; What's extra with it -
&gt;  A 5x10 tandem axle, enclosed trailer that contains various spare parts
&gt; and a rebuild-able motor and transmission.

What is a 5x10 tandem axle, enclosed trailer worth in your area.... It would 
go for $2500 in a NY minute in my area....


&gt; *Did the Westy come with a little ottoman/footstool?  This one has a
&gt; stool that the gentleman claims is OEM equipment.

That Stool is worth a million!  ,,, almost worth the deal right there...

&gt; The gentleman is asking $3,500 for it with all the extras.

&gt; Does that sound reasonable?

Me ,, I would line up selling the trailer ,, buy the deal and turn over the 
trailer to cover your costs....

ymmv
