This is the second instance that I'm aware of where a Mark Stephens engine
came with worn parts. In the other instance, among other things, the oil pump
as worn out and in both cases the warranty issue was a problem. 

I have Stephens heads and like most people think they are excellent but I
believe I would wave anyone off from buying their engines. Just my opinion....
