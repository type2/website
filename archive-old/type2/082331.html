Subject: Re: [T2] Is there an alternative to a BN4?

&gt; The idea of a supplemental heat source, particularly one that can be
&gt; used while in camp, is extremely attractive to me. Is there another

I bought a Coleman PowerCat for $65. It uses those 16oz propane canisters
and has a DC fan. It puts out about 3000btu/hr for 8 hours on one $1.80 can
of propane. The fan uses two D size batteries or can be plugged into an
adapter and run off the 12v DC in the bus.

What is most impressive about the PowerCat is the base is large enough to
use while driving. I've never had it tip over. It also fits nicely between
the front seats in my '74 Campmobile.
