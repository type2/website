&gt; You have a point here.  I hadn't thought about the gyroscopic forces.  Of

Did you say where you read this article? I'd be interested in seeing it 
myself. 

Turbines are supposed to be very efficient in power/weight and 
power/fuel consumption, but they have other design problems. Chrysler 
experimented with them back in the 50s, according to my dad. They 
supposedly released a few for road testing (dad said he saw one down in 
Nashville). Using an &quot;infinate speed&quot; variable tranny, they didn't shift 
gears in the normal sense. I understand acceleration was not good, noise 
levels were high, and high exhaust temps were problems.

These, of course, would not necessarily be problems in the design you 
are talking about. Hmm... the flywheel would act like a big rubber band 
to store energy. Depending on the efficientcy of the flywheel drive 
systems, this could prove to be considerably more efficient than 
batteries.

BTW, did they mention how long it takes to spin up the system in the 
mornings?

I've also been told that buses ARE being operated that use the system I 
mentioned earlier... in San Francisco and other cities, complete with 
the charging stations. Imagine... electrically powered vehicles that can 
free themselves from their power supply for periods of time... then 
quickly charge up... and away they go again.
