Subject: Re: [T2] shifting

One more thing for you...

It may just need an adjustment but I kind of figure that it has received no 
maintenance for about 30 years so it couldn't hurt a thing to get some new 
grease in there and do all of the adjustments.

When I have to futz around with one item on my bus that has never gotten 
any attention from me I just do the whole shebang...

Consequently most everything is in good shape in a reasonable amount of 
time and not waiting to fail so late dark rainy night on the highway... &lt;grin!&gt;

&gt; &gt; You need to do the full maintenance schedule for your tranny and then
&gt; &gt; reassess it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Grease the shifter, replace the shifter bushings, replace the coupler,
&gt; &gt; adjust the shifter, adjust the clutch, replace the tranny oil with GL-4
&gt; &gt; spec oil ONLY (GL-5 will damage it).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Then see if things have improved. Should be able something you can do at
&gt; &gt; home and thus not a high cost.
