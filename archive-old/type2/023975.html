&gt; &gt;What I'm saying is Learn to drive your volkswagen! If it means riding 
&gt; &gt;the clutch alittle to smooth the dead spot, then do it. Don'be a baby 
&gt; &gt;about a little hesitation!!!!! 
   
 &gt; I would say this argument is ridiculous! Learn to TUNE your VW! Don't 
 &gt; ride the clutch (early clutch failure), Don't settle for dead spots, 
 &gt; Don't settle for hesitation. 

How can I not agree with that? 

&gt;VWs _never_ would have been as popular as 
&gt;they were if they ran this way new, IMHO. 

The were popular because they were inexpensive, and using a vacuum distributor
rather than a centrifigal one 
probably saved them saved them money, instead of trying to figure out how to
make a centrifical one pass emissions.


&gt;I believe you _can_ tune a 
&gt;VW   to run well with a 34PICT &amp; 009 if you tweak the carb,
&gt; but the characteristics of the stock distributor &amp; stock carb are probably 
&gt;better, especially in something as heavy as the bus. 


Let me Quote Muir as he's much more adept
at saying what I was trying to above:

&quot;The vacuum advance distributor(s)...are another sop to American buyers who
refuse to learn to shift a car with a little coordination. This is a personal
beef, so forgive me. I use the straight mechanical advance distributor...which
advances the distributor on RPM as the engine speeds up...it gives a very good
power curve on the VW engine.
The vacuum distributor advances the spark based on the vacuum in the
carburator (as opposed to RPM) and they will never make good since the
principle is wrong.&quot; p.104, HTKYVA! 

Furthermore this is about the only customizing I ever do to  VWs. The only
things I think of changing on a VW are the so-called 'sop(s) to American
buyers'  like an automatic transmission, air conditioning, usually the
34pict3, not because I ride my clutches out after 20 miles or can't stand the
dead spot but because they were introduced on the 1971 bus instead of the
european twin carbs to power the 1600, because it gives more exact control of
the vacuum, but also because using a hybrid centrifigal/vacuum distributor in
conjunction with it would allow it to pass the california emissions.

So what I'm saying is I prefer the 009 for $60 bucks I now where my next ones
coming from. (I also know where my next inspection sticker is coming from -
don't ever throw away your vacuum distributor) It works for me. The 34.3 on
its shiniest day out of the box about town, is well...eeeehhh. The 30 pict 1 &amp;
2  are simplier, provide plenty of power for highway driving 55-65 without
trouble, work on the dual port just fine with the 009 and once you feel and
shift with the motor there are no deadspots.
