Subject: [T2] 68 Westy to good home only(free)

Hey volks,  (Located in Omaha, NE)
after much debate in my head i am looking to give my
68 westy a new home.  its price will be free, the same
price i paid for it.   there are conditions though: i
saved this bus from the junkyard so i would like it to
go to someone who is looking to get it on the road,
not part it out, if that were the case i would chop it
up and eb_at_y it.   basically if you are looking to
restore a bus or just get one to go on tour or cruise
the country as a driver, then you can have it.  as far
as its condition, its decent.   
Motor:
Not in bus.   1600 taken apart but everything there to
put it together minus heads(as far as i know).   case
looks good, pistons/sleeves new in box, all gaskets
new in package, all bearings new in package.  crank
redone and still oiled in a bag.   basically a whole
lotta parts in some boxes.  if you know youre upright
engines should it not be too bad.

Exterior:
body panels straight, someone replaced doglegs and
rockers at some point and riveted instead of welding
them on, but did a very good job of it as far as hacks
go, ie it is very presentable.   nose has small crease
in it but again is presentable.   sliding door has one
rust area about 12 inches up from bottom, one rust
hole passenger side in front of rear wheel well and
back driver side corner was hit and is bondo city.  
pop top would need rubber grommet that seals it to the
body when down, pop top functions fine but looks OLD.
canvas is tore up pretty good but again could be
patched for a travelin bus.

Interior:
westy side cabinet and z-bed in good shape, also has
seat behind drivers seat in good shape.   front seats
beat but there.   has upper cot.   missing sink unit. 
 wood panelling above rear seat is present and on
sliding door, but rest is MIA.   floors have some
surface rust, one small hole but mostly pretty much
all solid.   front floors im not sure of, but my feet
havent gone through.   i beleive someone lost the
original key so they took apart the ignition, but
there is another one there with key.   original
saphire radio in the dash.

so there you have it, a project, but a free project.  
im sure there are some bits and pieces missing as it
was a project someone else started and stopped, but i
hate to see any bus cut up or junked when it still has
some life left.  the only reason im getting rid of it
is that my wife and i will be moving cross country and
have to get 3 vehicle east, so a 4th that doesnt run
is a bit of a headache.   there are some pics of it on
my web site in the VW section and im happy to take
specific pics of anything you want.   im sure there
are some extra parts included so you could even sell
these to make an extra buck.   pmail me if you would
like to give her a new home.  if someone wants they
can also post to vintage list.
