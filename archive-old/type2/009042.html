Subject: UPDATE - 78 BUS FOR SALE
Message-Id: &lt;199904241653.MAA25737_at_mail.99main_dot_com&gt;

78 VW bus for sale in SE CT - $1500 OBO.

Got it running this morning - seems to run pretty well -
still not driveable - shifter needs replaced.

Body in good condition - no holes - originally from 
west coast (only been east for 5 years - has sat covered 
for last year).  Currently not running appears to have a problem 
with FI - engine turns over.  Tranny rebuilt in 1994.  Comes
with tow bar. 

Pictures available on request.
