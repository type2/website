Subject: Re: [T2] 68-71 Bus' have upright motors, but can you&gt;&gt;&gt;

&gt; I know these are upright motors, but what is the

&gt; 
&gt; Otherwords, can you simply take a motor from a bug and
&gt; bolt it right up to your bus??
&gt; 
&gt; The only thing i can think of that would be different
&gt; is the bottom motor bracket.. but then again im just
&gt; generally familar w/ the T1 motor and still learning
&gt; about bus'..

been a long time since I had my upright engines but I am pretty sure the
fan housing is different, it is flat on the top so the engine is a bit
shorter
