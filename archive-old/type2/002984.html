Well, Like I said I've been know to make bone-head mistakes. With my new  0
degree timing mark, I took my timing right down to 7 1/2 BTDC and it
obviously slowed the rpms but it idled just fine. My DFEV is clean, jetted
for altitude and running fine. Thank you Dr. Tim and sorry for the trouble.

&gt; My '78 doesn't have a TDC mark on the pulley. Haynes explains that later
&gt; Busses had a TDC marker on the flywheel- and I should &quot;take my Bus to the
&gt; agent....&quot; So for the last year I've just timed it &quot;by ear&quot;.  When I
pulled
&gt; my engine last week, I finally was able to visually find TDC on #1 and
mark
&gt; the pulley.  My dwell is around 45degrees. My RPM is at 900-50. I bought a
&gt; black plastic pulley/timing gauge from RMMW since mine didn't have one.
&gt;
&gt; My confusion is that the only way I can make the Bus run smoothly is to
have
&gt; the timing set around 16 -20 degrees BTDC! and when I rev the engine it'll
&gt; go as high as 40 degrees BTDC. According to Haynes I should be at 71/2
&gt; degrees. It'll will barely idle at 71/2.
&gt;
&gt; I've been running it at 16-20 BTDC for a year and it's been running great.
&gt; I'd just like to know what's up?
&gt;
&gt; I have a Weber DFEV progressive instead of F.I.
&gt; The distributor has to #s, top 0231 168 005 and bottom 021 905 205 P also
&gt; says JFUD
&gt; Any help appreciated.
