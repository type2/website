Subject: oil suction pipe
Message-ID: &lt;0.d73a4ea.2555d350_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

    Greetings Everyone!
        Muir says to remove the oil suction pipe before cleaning the case.  
He indicates that there is a single bolt or screw holding the assembly on.  
In bently there is a picture of a screw holding the large round piece to the 
floor of the sump.  The case in the picture is different from mine.  I have a 
1700, and there are no fasteners present.  The closest thing is an 8 or 9 mm 
allen set screw (actually more of a plug) peened into the exterior of the 
case.  Looking down the oil passage from the oil pump bore I see no signs 
that this screw(plug) is hold the oil pipe in place.  I can wiggle the pipe 
but it does not want to come out.  Has anyone else encountered this 
situation?  Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks
