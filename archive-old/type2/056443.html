Subject: Transmission choice.

Hi Volks,
          I think that someone out there knows the answer to this, but I couldn't find it in the archives.

 I am planning a 911 engine swap for my '77 camper. I anticipate using a VW gearbox to simplify the installation but the one I have at the moment is a bit crunchy, so I plan to replace it.
 I'd like to move to a higher top gear, if it's practical. A five-speed would be nice if it were a bolt-up to the existing transmission mounts, shifter linkage and driveshafts.

 If I'm staying with a four-speed the the early vanagon transmission seems to have the highest ratio. Does this bolt up to the '77?

 The later waterboxers and diesels had five-speed boxes, I believe: 
 I guess that the diesels have different mounts because of the different engine layout- the stock setup has a low final-drive ratio, too, but that might be correctable if the mounting setup were the same. Anyone know whether this transmission fits?
 I read that the waterboxer engine is shorter than the aircooled four and that the transmission mounts are therefore different. Is this true? Does it make this swap much harder?

 I know it's feasible to put a Porsche 901 or 915 transmission into a bus but I don't want to tackle the challanges associated with it this time round. If there's an easier option using a VW transmission then I'd like to pursue it but otherwise I'll probably just go with replacing my current gearbox.

Thanks for any input.
Cheers,
        W.
