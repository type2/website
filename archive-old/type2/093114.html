Subject: Re: [T2] black smoke

Carb mixture. It will need an adjustment first. If the tuning doesn't help 
then you need to re-jet the carb. Typical problem.

Start by checking to see if the choke is stuck shut.

I suggest the Weber carb book. I got mine through CB Performance but I'm 
sure ANY bookstore can get you good Weber carb books.

&gt;    I have about 3000 miles on my 79 Westy's rebuilt 1800cc engine. It has 
&gt; a webber carb kit on it. My question is how do i get the black smoke to 
&gt; stop coming from my tailpipe. It is to the point where it stains my 
&gt; bumper, I don't know if it is the mixture on the carb or what. The idle 
&gt; seems to be set a bit to high as well. I have no clue which screws on the 
&gt; carb are for the mixture and which are for the idle. I have tried to look 
&gt; up stuff on the web to see if there is a diagram but I have had no luck.
