Subject: LOUD noise, almost random, =?iso-8859-1?q?huh=3F=3F=3F?=

Howdy all, here's a weekend stumper that I could sure use some insight
with.                                                                 
I'm posting to both lists, since (I think) it's a drum brake issue.   
(1964)                                                                
Friend arrives at my house last night, and says front end is making a 
horrible, loud, metallic sound that vibrates the whole vehicle. She's 
pretty tweaked, so I agree to drive it around and see what I can find.
She couldn't really tell me what made the noise happen, only that it  
seemed pretty random.                                                 
I hop in, throw it in neutral, and it starts right up, idles smooth,  
runs great.(engine fine, I deduce)                                    
push in the clutch, no noise. Shift into reverse, no noise, back out  
of parking space, and proceed to drive around my block, making all    
right turns. No noise accelerating, slowing, turning, braking,        
anything. She is upset because now it seems fine. So, I agree to      
re-trace her route to my house, and see if we can figure out what     
happens. As soon as I make a left turn, it happens- loud, vibrating   
noise, from the front. I hit the brake pedal really hard, like 3      
times, and it stops, and we're still rolling. Weird...so I drive some 
more, no problem with straight, stopping, starting, or right turns,   
but as soon as I make a left turn, I get this noise. My best guess is 
that the brakes are somehow grabbing, because when I stomp the pedal, 
it stops, but why the heck would it only happen on left turns? What do
left turns have to do with the brakes? Argh! This of course was       
happening already after my bed time, after working overtime all week, 
so my brain's not on the best functioning level.                      
 Anyway, I really appreciate any hints, leads, advice, clues, what to 
check first, etc. Current plan of action calls for pulling the front  
drum for a look-see, but I'm working all day today, so I don't know   
when I'll get the chance.                                             
Oh yeah, front drums were hotter to the touch than rear wheels...     
thanks.
