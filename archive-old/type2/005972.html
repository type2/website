You old timers on the Vanagon list, know that we poured about $6,000 into 
improving the heat, interior noise level, and body longevity on my wife's 
(now former) van. I made a bunch of photos and diagrams at the time and 
(like many of us have), made bold proclamations about an upcoming 
website...

At long last, HERE IT IS.

This &quot;case study&quot; is focused on a 1976 2.0 FI (air-cooled), but there are 
PLENTY of lessons for any vehicle is you are interested in reducing 
interior noise levels, improving heat, and increasing the longevity of your 
van/car. Recent thread participants discussing insulation will be greatly 
rewarded.

Those folks finishing yet another winter in an air-cooled VW with no heat 
will find this to be their last winter to wear a coat in the car. In the 
words of the van's current owner: &quot;...on the way up to VA last weekend we 
had to turn the heat OFF...it was baking us out.&quot; (It was in the high 20's 
to low 30's that weekend).

I ask only two things. First, visit our &quot;Terms of Use&quot; page. 
http://www.bulley-hewlett_dot_com/page19.html It basically tells you: &quot;All 
material on the site is copyright(c)1999 Bulley-Hewlett &amp; Associates&quot;, and 
&quot;use this info at your own risk&quot;.

Second, please don't call our business line with VW questions. You KNOW I 
want to help, but e-mail is the best way to reach me without disrupting my 
business. If you think your question would help the knowledge-base of the 
respective mail group, post it there, and I will respond there. (I am off 
the T2 list, but will answer mail to my address). Thanks!

Now, Happy motoring. http://www.bulley-hewlett_dot_com/VWindex
