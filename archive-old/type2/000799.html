I got this from the vintagevw list but I thought it was especially
appropriate and sounds like a genius idea, if you have a torch...

hi jeff,
this is not ajoke -try it!go to the grocery store and purchase parafine wax
it is used in canning,comes in a big block. heat the stud red hot ,apply the
block of wax to the stud -it will melt onto the stud-95% of the time stud
will screw out with your fingers after it has cooled down. you can use a
pair of pliers if you cant wait.the wax will get into places in the tapped
hole that havent seen the light of day for 30 years.penitrating oil doesnot
travel down the stud like you hope it does.try it brefore you laff.bill may

&gt; One of my heads I have successfully rebuilt has one more thing to fix, a
&gt; broken exhaust stud.
&gt;
&gt; There's about 3/16 of an inch stub sticking out.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone have tips on how to remove this sucker?
&gt;
&gt; TIA
