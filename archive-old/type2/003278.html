Hey Christopher,

I really would repair the Type 4 engine instead of putting a 1600 Type 1
engine in a Camper.

I've the old 58 split 1200 cc for more than 20 years now, but I learned to
love the 77 westy with it's 2.0 pancake engine.
Yes, it takes more petrol (about 85 cent per LITER here), here in germany I
have to pay more road-tax than for a 1600 - but I'd never swap it against a
1600 westy.
The 2.0 is still a good motorised Bus, a 1600 with 50 hp has been it in the
early 70s, when a beetle had 40 hp. Today every Golf has got at least 75hp
and all the owners do use the power.

The other thing is durability. We've nerver had a 1600 engine in a Bus that
lasted longer than 70.000 mls. When I got my
2.0 westy it had 125.000 mls with first engine, the only reason to change it
was, that I could get a brand new VW-engine for little money.
The old one still lives in a friends car, who never leaves the city...

Best wishes,
Michael

'58 split ( 1200 upright)
'77 westy (2.0 pancake)
'74 412L (1.8 pancake)
'70 914 (1.7 pancake)
