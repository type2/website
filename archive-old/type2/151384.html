Subject: Re: [T2] New concept van in Michelin Challenge with bus feel

Hi Michael,

VW killed off that project quite a while ago. Probably because  
pricing would have been in the $60K range.

It's not that I didn't like the verdier design, it's just that it  
wasn't even remotely possible with current technology. There was so  
much camping gear and storage space that there was nowhere to put an  
engine or a fuel source. But the verdier concept had some great  
Ideas... my favorite was the passenger seat that converted into a  
staircase to access the pop-top.

Happy trails,
