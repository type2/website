Oh, great carburetor god, when are you next planning a trip to L.A.? :-)

&gt;Remember that you need three basic things for your engine to run - spark,
&gt;compression, and fuel.

Yep, I remember. :-)

&gt;You already know that you have compression.

I'm considering having that tested again. Don Boneau and I did the test in
May, and came up with #1 _at_ 128, #2-4 _at_ 115. She's hardly been driven since
then. That was also when we found out the #2 cylinder wasn't responding to
removal of the plug wire at the distributor cap.

&gt;Test
&gt;for fuel by dripping some fuel in the right carb with a turkey baster or
&gt;straw while the engine is idling.  Do the cylinders suddenly start firing?
&gt;Then fuel is your problem.  Otherwise, it's spark.  See how easy that was?
&gt;:-)

So you're saying I should remove the #1 plug at idle, drop some gas in the
right carb, and look for hesitation. Repeat with #2 plug. Correct?

I just don't see how it could be spark since I've replaced everything but
the rotor -- and how could a rotor only effect two cylinders?

I had the carbs replaced because the mechanic said the left one was no good
(and he sent the first replacement left carb back because he was
dissatisfied with it). It's been the LEFT carb that's been showing
problems, but the RIGHT side of the engine that's giving me/us fits -- all
because it doesn't falter when you pull the plug wires at the cap.

&gt;I'm assuming you're talking about not pulling weight at idle.  If the right
&gt;head were not pulling it's weight under heavy throttle, you wouldn't be
&gt;able to get up to 60mph on level ground.  Since I don't hear you
&gt;complaining of no power on the freeway, I'll assume you are hitting on all
&gt;four when you're on the freeway and the problem is only at idle.

I did notice that the idle seemed high and she would bog down just about
when I was ready to shift (higher RPMs). Also, she used to get up to about
70 before I'd know it, but now it's cruising at 60, but smoother, easier. I
went back to the mechanic and he adjusted the throttle cable, which he said
was too tight.

Now, on the way home tonight, she stalls at lights -- not quickly, but say
if I just hit the red light, just about the time it turns green the idle
slowly drops off to nothing, and then she doesn't want to start right back
up again. And instead of a nice clicking noise from the electric fuel pump,
it was making this kinda warbly sound (but now it's back to clicking).
Maybe I need a new fuel pump? But that would just go or no go, right, not
fade out of service?

&gt;That
&gt;*really* points to a fuel problem since you have a separate idle circuit in
&gt;your carbs.  If you don't understand your central idling system, break out
&gt;the books and start reading.

Central idling system? I haven't a clue what you're talking about. 'S Greek
to me. Tell me where to start. I'm still on Carbs 101. What's a throttle
bushing?

Yrgh,

Nikki
