I'll offer the following with the standard &quot;this is what I did but follow my
example at your own risk&quot; disclaimer.

I have a '79 Westy that I've used as a daily driver for about 12 years, so
it rarely sits for long.  But if I either a) leave it for a week or more, or
b) park it on a steep hill overnight, it will sometimes make the loud valve
noise for several minutes on starting up.  I believe (someone correct me if
I'm wrong) the oil has drained out of the hydrolic valves and it sometimes
takes them a while to refill.  Is this bad for the valves?  Probably a bit,
but the occasional occurance doesn't seem to have done mine any serious
harm.  So depending on how you feel about risk taking, you might try running
the engine a few minutes before tearing it down.

Good luck!

Sounds like you need some valve work. The same thing happened to my 1982
Vanagon. It knocked loudly when you first started it in the morning, then it
would go away after a few minutes. The mechanic took the head off, and
noticed the worn valves. The engine _at_ the time had 156,000 original miles on
it. Good luck with yours, and yes, it was an expensive repair.

I got home and decided to take my 79' westy out
to the local campground and relax. Well heres were my
problem occured, the van has been sitting a few weeks
and so i decided to turn it over via the start switch
installed in back, w/the coil unplugged I turned the
engine over a few times to pre lube it. no peculier
noises then. but when i started it up w/ the coil
hooked up it sounded horribble a very loud knocking
sound that didnt seem like it was going away so I shut
her down. What is it thats wrong. It made noise in the
past at start up but quite very quickly within a
minute
as oil pressure built up. I beleive the latter to be
normal. Any help or insight would be greatly
appreciated! Im afraid a rebuild will probably have to
be added to my to do list:( Thanks for reading and
thanks for any help.
