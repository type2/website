&gt;Mike, where do you camp?  Most of the parks I've been to allow the giant 
&gt;RVs (TVs, gens, ACs, etc.) to park right alongside the tenters.

I group campgrounds into three basic categories:

A)  Campgrounds with all facilities that accomodate large RVs (have large 
pull-through &quot;campsites&quot;).  All KOAs are in this category.  This type will 
have at least one huge RV parked with their four umbilical cords hooked up 
(electric, cable, water, sewer) and the A/C on, unless you get really 
lucky.  They are usually close to the highway and around $20/night.  Not 
really camping in my book, more of a cheap motel substitute.

B)  Campgrounds that can accomodate large RVs but do not have 
electricity.  Some state and national parks fall into this category.  This 
type will have at least one huge RV parked with the generator running 
constantly to support A/C, fridge, and lights.  This is my least favorite 
type of campground since generators are noisier than A/C and since there is 
usually natural beauty around to be spoiled, unlike in type A campgrounds 
which are usually between the interstate and the railroad tracks.

C)  Campgrounds that do not accomodate large RVs.  My favorite type because 
they are usually in out-of-the-way places which are more beautiful and (an 
added bonus) cheaper because of the lack of services.  Sometimes this type 
of campground will be ruined by someone in a small RV that brings a 
generator and runs it to power their rooftop A/C or charge their 
batteries.  I wouldn't be caught dead doing this!

My goal is to make my bus as independent as possible so that I can camp in 
type C campgrounds, but not utilizing a generator.  This means lots of 
batteries, solar panels, and electrical efficiency.  It also means no A/C, 
but that's usually not a problem since type C campgrounds are usually in 
the mountains and cool off enough at night that it's possible to sleep 
given adequate ventilation.  If it's too hot to sleep, I will take the 
window A/C unit and stay at a type A campground at night.

As for permanently mounting a rooftop A/C unit in a VW camper, I would 
advise against it unless you never leave the Gulf coast and spend all of 
your time camping in type A campgrounds.  The weight/aerodynamic/aesthetic 
penalties are IMO just too high otherwise.
