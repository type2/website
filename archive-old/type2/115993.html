&gt; BTW...my youngest son *does* know how to rebuild a dp 1600!
&gt; Pretty proud of myself over that one&lt;grin&gt;.

i am proud, too. my 6-year old daughter has helped me rebuild every engine i
have done in the past 1 1/2 years (3 and counting). i mean it, she actually
helps for real. she is especially good at using the torque wrench on low
settings. so much so that she asked me a few months ago if she could have a
torque wrench - she has her own collection of tools starting up. i told her
she could have one if she could tell me what a torque wrench is used for.
she told me exactly, &quot;dad, it is so you don't make the bolts too tight or
too loose&quot;, so now my little girl has my sears torque wrench, and i have an
excuse to buy myself a snap-on...

cool.
