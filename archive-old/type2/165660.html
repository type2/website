Subject: Re: [T2] Catalytic converter flow only one way?

exhaust is supposed to flow into and out of it. That's the way it should be mounted with the arrow heading towards the muffler.
You wouldn't go up the down staircase--right?
Go into the door mark &quot;Women&quot; ?

**Thanks Terry, No, I wouldn't do those things, I'm not stupid. It seems that you missed the text I wrote. I do know why they stamped a flow arrow on the cat. The question was not &quot;why is it stamped on there?&quot; The question was:
   &quot;It appears that the baffle may have been installed onto the cat. backwards, as the flow arrow is pointing towards the triangle flange, which actually should connect to the inlet Y-pipe. Is it OK to assume they installed it backwards and does direction of flow through a cat. make a difference in its function?&quot; Does this clarification help with a suggestion?
  Thanks, Chris
