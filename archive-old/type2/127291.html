Subject: Battery Drain

Hey type two guru's.

I need some help. I have a 71 standard bus that seems
to drain the battery dead overnight. everything on it
seems to work ok...........and it runs alright but i
need some advise as to what the culprit might
be......? my first thought is the voltage regulator.
what do you guys think or suggest that i can try?
Rus in b-ville.
