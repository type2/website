Subject: Re: [T2] Garmin GPS

Hi Richard, I was trying to buy the Garmin 330 which has an internal drive, but my local supplier kept postponing it's delivery date, to the point I just cancelled it. I really liked it, but the 320 doesn't have the locked in HD, instead it uses SD cards, and you can load other things onto it. 
I ended up getting the Lowrance Iway 250C instead, and am really happey I did. It was cheaper, but has the same color touchscreen, around 2.5&quot; square. It is like the Garmin 320, it uses SD cards, but in my opinion is better. The Garmins don't allow waypoints along the way, you have to &quot;stitch&quot; shorter trips together. It also will not tell you the long. and lat. like the Lowrance does. I am REALLY happy I couldn't buy the Garmin, because I stumbled upon the Lowrance 250C which does more in my humble opinion. Check one of those out before you buy a Garmin, or compare the two side by side at http://www.gpscity_dot_ca/
I have had mine for 10 days now, and love it.
HTH,
Courtney

 I was shopping over the weekend and came across a specialty store 
 selling Garmin GPS devices. They've come a long way since I last 
 looked at them a few years ago finally offering pleasant color 
 touch screens.
 
Does anyone have any experience with them to share?
