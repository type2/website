Subject: Re: Help on touch up painting

The one thing I was disappointed by when I painted my bus recently was
how easy the paint chipped afterward. Painting and body prep is an
ART.... If it's not your fortay you will end up with so so results that
only a few people will notice, however you save lots of money by doing
it your self and you have allot more pride in your work. Since you say
you paint chips are small this is what I would do:

Look in your Yellow Pages for Automotive Paint Supply's, I would think
even the smallest town should have one shop, First ask them if they can
find your paint code listed, I had no problem with Pastel White but that
is fairly common. If not they might have a device that takes a picture
of your paint and comes up with a color formula.
Then they will mix you up a small container that has color ready to
apply to your chip spots. I have found a small Make Up brush works best
when touching up small chips, my wife had several old ones she gave me.

To prep the chips I would lightly wet sand only the ones that show rust
with some 1200 grit sandpaper, let dry and paint. Try to contain your
sanding only to the rust in the spot, a small pointed Orange stick is
perfect for this, the wife had an extra one of these also.

I hope this helps and good luck finding your paint code, have you
checked out the Wolfsburg West Sight? I also recall finding the actual
mixing codes for my paint somewhere, it might be linked from their
sight, I think under Glasurite. Someone correct me if i'm wrong please.
