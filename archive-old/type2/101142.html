Subject: Re: [T2] Starter woes

Even if autozone does sell a bosch starter they charge insane amounts of
money for them. I remember about a year back i needed a new starter and
they quoted me something like a few bucks shy of $200 for an &quot;OEM&quot; quality
starter. bad news. I ended spending 100 on a new bosch one. I refuse to
put crap in my bus and that is generally what you get at autozone: really
expensive crap IMHO. 

They also get aobut $170 for their bus alternators, who knows where they
come from, their employees certainly don't.

Who is to say whether or not autozone's stuff is good or not. What i know
is
that VW but bosch stuff in my bus. And VW spends some serious money
producing their vehicles. They know what they are doing. Bosch parts have
always proven to work for me and
I will continue to put bosch stuff on my bus, and nothing but bosch when
its available. And why not
when you can get it for half the autozone price from the bus depot? I will
not risk taking chances with offbrands. German stuff is always better.
There is too much aftermarket crap floating around at stores like
autozone. I put VW/Bosch/hella stuff on my bus and GM/Delco stuff on my
chevy. period. Sometimes it costs more upfront but it *always* saves you
money down the road.

Just my 2 cents.
