Subject: Re: [T2] cal/fed busses (was clutch)

From: &quot;Billy&quot;
&gt; --California busses varied in their exhaust systems from other busses, but I
don't believe california/federal had any bearing on whether they were carbed
or f.i. The cc's and fuel delivery systems were the same for any given bus of
any given year (73, 1700, dual carbs/76, 2l, f.i.) etc.

Whoa, not true.
74 Cal bus with AUTO trans was FI. All other USA 74 buses were carbed. FI
started in all 50 states in 75.

And all 215 flywheels I have seen have 2 sets of threaded holes: 7mm for 215
clutches. 8mm for 210 clutches. Yes, you can put either clutch on IF you have
the bolts. In a pinch, not knowing if you have a 210 or 215, you can get a 210
and the 6 8mm bolts...
