Subject: need type2-digest V1 #271

For some weird reason I could not read yesterdays Type2 Volume 271
digest.  Every time I tried to open it, it would destroy my email program
and lock up my computer.  Anyone else have this problem?  If not,  could
someone forward me a working copy of it.  TIA Ken  82 westy
