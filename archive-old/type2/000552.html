&quot;This question has to do with part of the exhaust system on my 79.  On the
driver's side &quot;U&quot; of the crossover pipe before it gets to the catalytic
converter, there is what looks like a large bolt-like thing sticking out of
the pipe.  It is threaded and about 1.5 inches long, with what looks like a
6-sided nut on top.&quot;

Sounds like the test port for gas analysis - normally when adjusting fuel
mixture you remove the cap, thread a pickup hose onto the port and set the
CO (with the O2 sensor disconnected). To properly do this adjustment you
have to read the exhaust gas content upstream of the catalytic converter.
