Subject: Dropped the exhaust again and took some pics

I thought the re-used copper gaskets to the heads were what was
leaking. Fooled me. Check out the pics exh1 - 3.

Yep. Definitely leaking from the pushrod tube seals. I s'pose I'll
have to tackle those soon. I need to do a valve adjustment anyway...
There's at least 2 more leaks, one possibly from the case seam and the
other looks like it's from one of the plates in the oil sump.

In the bottom right corner of this picture, you see a nipple. That's
the fuel pump... Where is that supposed to be hooked up? Or is it just
a vent and I could run the hose aft?

Exterior pics. Yep. Body's even rustier than I thought. :-(  Still
seems to be just surface dusting on the frame and floor though. Whew.
