Subject: Ventilating crankcase with an alternator on upright engines

 I wonder if I could get some advice from the list gurus. I have recently
installed an alternator in my upright engine. As most of us know, the
alternator oil tower doesn't have a road draft tube, they just have a double
big hole that presumably leads to the air breather. I have the j shaped hose
that goes on that outlet. My 70 air breather of course uses a  hose that is
considerably smaller.

Is it enough for engine breathing to couple the two hoses together with a
hose fitting? Should I put a T inline so excess pressure has somewhere to
vent? Is the suction from the breather enough under these circumstances?
What did others do here when installing alternators?
Should I vent the rocker covers to a breather box? The engine is a 1776cc.
