Subject: won't turn off

Hi Everybody,
This morning I locked the house and went out to my bus to go to
work.  As the engine was warming I decided to run back in and get
my gloves as it's starting to get a little cold here in Northern
California.  I turned the ignition off, pulled the key out  and
made a little wish that there was a way to take the key out
without turning the ignition off.  That way the Bus could
continue to warm while I ran back into the house.

When I pulled into the parking lot at work and turned the
ignition key off, my wish came true.  The bus just kept on
running as if nothing had happened.  I tried several times to
turn the ignition on and off but it had no effect.  I finally
pulled the coil wire, but then the idiot lights stayed on so then
I disconnected the battery.  After work I hooked everything back
up, turned the ignition key and it started right up.

A preliminary inspection has turned up no loose wires under the
dash, in the engine compartment, or at the starter.  The
electrical half of the ignition switch is only 2 years old, but
my guess is that this is where the problem is.  Does anybody have
any other ideas?  I'm open to all suggestions.

If I had known I was going to get one wish this holiday season I
would have wished for World Peace or a New Canvas for my poptop
or something big like that.

Thanks for the help and Happy Holidays.
