I said my 1974 Westy was a B but now after explaining the parameters I'd
have to go for the C. It's still got the original orange paint faded of
course. And the po ran something over and ripped a small hole in the metal
just behind the right rear tire. But it does have new canvas,seals,carpet,
and birch paneling on the doors. And the odometer says 71,000 original
miles. The engine runs great but it needs new tires.
