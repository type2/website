Subject: FS: 76 Dlx Westy Camper w/78 eng in S Delaware

Very very nice deluxe package Sage Green Westy Poptop Camper w/'78 
engine (love those hydraulic lifters and 150 lbs compression when last tested). Garage kept. Just a bit of rust on sliding door and bumper. Body nice/straight except minor dent in sliding door. 
VDO gauges. Great running condition - so much so I used as my daily driver when the Civic was in the shop for a couple months. Ah the irony.

Original, nearly perfect, green plaid interior (front seats re-upholstered in mismatched plaid). Stove, refrig, 2 tables, jumpseat/storage/trash box, rear hatch screens, 4 new tires, new brakes, new batteries, new windshield. 

Serviced almost all its life at dealer. All orig receipts from the 2 
previous S Cal owners and myself. 

If you want a near perfect pop top camper that, with very little work will be show material, this is it. Or even if you just want to toodle across the country withthe family - this is it.

Price: $4600.00

Selling :( I got a job and am moving to the UK. If I can't get what I think she is worth, into storage she goes to wait my return.

Van can be found in Southern Delaware about 2 hours from DC, Balt, and Philly. Near Cape May-Lewes Ferry.
