Subject: Re: Putting in the Pop Top

    One of the posts on this thread stated that there wasn't really much
reason to bother with the poptop, since it's only use most of the time
was to allow standing room for getting dressed. I disagree.
     Having lived in my van for over a month straight now, I quickly
discovered that a major drawback to the VW Westy as a long-term camper
is space -- not nearly enough. Even though it's just me and my cat, a
lengthy stay requires one heck of a lot of stuff. And I'm constantly
wishing I had stuff I left at home, and at the same time constantly
bitching about having way too much stuff -- there's no place to put it
all. 
     So what I use the poptop for is extra storage space. During the
day, when I drive to work, of course the poptop is down, so that space
is gone. The whole back area behind the back seat is filled with
bedding, pillows, and other stuff. My big suitcase and dirty laundry bag
occupies the back seat. My big tool box just fits along the left wall
between the rear seat and the rear-facing passenger seat. On top of it
is a box of kitchen stuff, and another one on top of the rear-facing
seat. Another suitcase is on the floor between the seat and the
cooler/sink, with my briefcase and laptop on top of it, and another box
of food, etc. on the floor in the big space in front of the rear seat,
along with the 2.5 gallon jugs of store-bought drinking water (I won't
drink tap water from anywhere, especially here in Mobile, one of the
most polluted places in the US), and then sometimes the pet carrier for
my cat, if he decides to come to work with me, so he can have his kitty
litter and food/water. Whew! A lot of stuff! Oh yes, the floor space in
front of the front passenger seat is also filled with a large box of
kitty food, litter, other junk.
     Anyway, it would be impossible to stay this way at night and on
weekends, so up goes the poptop, unfold the cot up there, and most of
this stuff goes up there. And voila! I have floor and seating space
again. 
      The poptop is great -- if you're doing any real camping, it's a
must. Another plus is when it gets warm -- and this actually happened
this last week -- you can unzip the windows up there to get more
*screened* ventilation. Who'd a thunk I'd be getting hot at night in my
van in Febuary, even in Mobile, but it was. Of course last night it was
back down in the 30's and even with my 1500watt electric heater going
full blast I almost had to break out the down sleeping bag to augment my
wool quilt. Brrr. 
     Some other bus came into the park last night, from Fla. I went over
this morning to meet them and see if they were on the list, but they
weren't up yet. Probably came for Mardi Gras. Maybe I'll catch them this
afternoon.
