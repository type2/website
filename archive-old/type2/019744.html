If anyone's interested, I found a 1966-67 15 window sp;it(I know,
68-83), but just had to share it with you all1 In decent(some rust, bad
front floors) condition, with tranny, 2 rebuildable engines and a tow
bar attached to the bumper! This is a make offer kinda deal, the ladies
husband died and she just wants to clean the lot. She also has about 15
or 16 tomato boxes full for VW bug-type parts:shrouds, heads, cranks,
carbs, dizzys etc., for $500.00 firm. If anyones interested, I will
p-mail you her phone #.

Bussingly yours,
