Subject: Battery Tray '72

Has anyone replaced their 'off side' passenger - right side battery tray in 
a '72.  If yes, what did you use for a replacement, the bus depot / bus boys 
battery tray [Battery Tray (Pass Side) 68-72 Bus] or the Just Kampers 
battery tray [T2 Battery tray 7/71 &gt; 5/79 offside ]

The battery tray I got from  bus depot  have seems to be at least two inches 
too wide for my '72.

Hopefully the '72 battery tray is not a 'one year' items
