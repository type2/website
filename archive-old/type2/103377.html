Subject: Re: [T2] Max temp

&gt;Everyone is saying, 180-200-210-220-230-240-250, my
&gt;question is simple. What is the max allowed temp on
&gt;the T-4 2.0L engine? I have a 80 Westy with a newly
&gt;rebuilt engine and it runs at 190-220. Phil

The oil has a lower tolerance than the engine. Get the oil too hot and it 
stops lubricating and that point is when the engine has problems too! &lt;grin&gt;

I have it understood as 212F is required to get the moisture out of the oil 
(condensation), and a bit higher than that for a period of time to get the 
combustion byproducts (acids) to burn off. There is a point around 240 
where basic dino oils quit doing their thing. Synthetics are capable of 
higher temps yet. HOWEVER it is not as simple as just temps. It is how hot 
for how long. Short bursts up to high temps are not as bad as extended high 
temps. Extended high temps cause some of the oil's ingredients to either 
evaporate or change towards something like tar (deposits?).

That's my layman's take on it and that requires a huge dose of salt. I can 
zip up all my &quot;archive&quot; articles (PDF docs) and send them to you if you 
like. There are gathered from various car and motorcycle lists.

Oil temps can be anything reasonable if the oil can handle it and the head 
temps top out when the valves burn and the seats fall out! &lt;grin&gt;

Seriously - can anybody correct me?
