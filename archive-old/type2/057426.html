&gt; Now I don't have any doubt that the above affects the heating/cooling of

&gt; And a previous post today made a good point in the lack of unnecessary
&gt; items in the design of the engine.  Why would VW design an &quot;air cooled&quot;
&gt; engine with flaps whose presence or absence makes no difference in the
&gt; ability of the engine to cool itself?  Granted, the thermostatic system


When the thermostat is open, the flaps help to guide the cooling air to
the right (hottest) spots in the engine.  The engine will probably cool
itself fine without them, due to a bit of overengineering, but it is
better to leave them on.  

As far as engine seals go, I've accidentally driven around without them
and not suffered any bad, but it was in the cool damp fall.  I think the
biggest benefit to having them is the positive pressure they maintain in
the engine compartment, meaning less work for the cooling fan and
therefore the motor.  The amount of hot air that gets sucked up there is
negligable when underway, as the exhaust heat is getting blown back
instead of up.  At idle, there is a lot of heat coming off the exhaust and
I would worry about sucking some of it up into the engine compartment.  Go
stand bahind your bus after a long drive, you can feel the heat coming off
themuffler from quite a ways away.
