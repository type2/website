&gt; &gt; stock '70 bus is spinning its poor little engine pretty fast at 65, let

&gt; &gt; real MPH.
&gt;
&gt; I should have mentioned that my front tires are 70 series (purchased before I knew any
&gt; better) so that wasn't my real speed.  From surrounding traffic and engine speed I would
&gt; guess I was probably going about 10 mph less than indicated.

Borrow a GPS and you might be in for a shock!  75MPH on my speedometer
translates to about 61 real MPH!
