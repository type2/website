Hi, I just thought I'd tell all of you about the 2 Minnesota shows I know
about.  The first one is in June, either the 6th or the 13th.  They didn't
know the exact date when I called.  Copy &amp; Paste the address below to find
out the directions to West Side VW (that's where the shows at.)

The 2nd show is in August at JAC Auto Repair &amp; Sales in Anoka, MN.  Phone#
612 421 2705.  They also didn't know the exact date of the show...

If you need any other info. email me.

Thanks &amp; Happy Busin'
