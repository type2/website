Hi,

A coupla years ago I was able to purchase the correct length seatbelts from
B.F.Y. http://www.bfyobsoleteparts_dot_com/ . They do not look stock but they
serve the purpose. I am sure there are other sources on the Internet as well
or maybe even your FLAPS has 'em.

About the perfed stuff under the windows.....I think that is part of the
headliner. Mine needs replacing as well but the rest of the headliner is
fine so if you have a solution to that problem lemme know:)
