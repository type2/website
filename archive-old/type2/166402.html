&gt;They all are working but the tach is kind of erratic, like it is getting

Gary,

If you were to look at an ignition spark signature on an oscilloscope you'll notice that the spark rings at the end of the burn duration. This can wig out the tach as it thinks it's seeing multiple spikes during a single spark event.

There ate two inexpensive cures I know of:

- wire a 1N4005 diode between Terminal 1 of the coil and the tach wire (cathode end goes to wire). Sometimes this method works; sometimes not but it's the $0.25 solution.

- use a 50kohm potentiometer and wire it like so to damp out the ringing (^ is center tap on pot):

Terminal 1---/\/\/\/\/\/\---gnd
                  ^
                  |
                  +---- VDO tach wire

Start at 0 ohms and increase until you get a stable tach signal at all rpms.
