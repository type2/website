Subject: Re: [T2] &quot;Tune-up's&quot; was:Horsepower question

Guys,

You are correct about the compression tester being one of the more
valuable tools in the box....

Most of the examples so far have been vehicles that have been on the road
for quite a few years with problems that have seemed &quot;odd&quot; to start with.

The kind of customer that I saw at the time(1972) were two kinds of
folks...people with 20-60k miles who wanted their cars to run better and
those with  older vw's that needed a rebuild anyway(and they knew it).

The folks with newer cars 20-60k just wanted to get better gas
mileage...seems like gas was the outrageous price of $1.50 at the
time(1972).  They drove in, wanted a &quot;tune-up&quot; and valve adjustment and
then wanted to pick up their car and drive on...

The folks with older vw's just wanted it to run a little longer before
they tried to decide if they could afford a rebuild....lot's of hippie's
driving vw's in those days.

I almost dreaded changing plugs out because about every 10th car would
strip the threads on a head....heavy handed &quot;american&quot; mechanics and
people who used the wrong plugs and hadn't changed them in 20,000 miles.

A lot of these people wanted to move over to Honda or Toyota cause they
got better gas mileage and had an A/C that worked too....You paid about
$1500 over invoice for either of those cars cause of the gas shortage.  
VW's then were &quot;cheap&quot; transportation and people wanted &quot;cheap&quot; tuneups.
I'm &quot;sure&quot; that the folks at the BMW and Mercedes dealerships did a
compression test....they had owners who could afford it.  Would you do a
compression test on a new vw with 8,000 miles that the owner wanted a
tune-up?....probably not.....

I did a lot of driver/owner education in those days about what was needed
and my customers appreciated it.

What we have now is a &quot;select&quot; clientelle who love their vw's for
what they are, not just a good mileage car.  Dr. Tim, I would have loved
to have the kind of customers then that you have now, but what I had were
people who wanted a bargain(tired of vw dealer rates) and still wanted
their cars to run well and get good gas mileage.

I always drove the cars before *and* after working on them to decide if it
ran well...if it didn't, I pulled it back in the shop and found out
why...even if it meant pulling the plugs again and doing a compression
test.

You guys keep doing compression tests...I will too....*now* is a different
time from then...and the people who have VW's now probably take a lot
better tender loving care of their cars than back then.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Yup,, the best thing in the tool box is a compression gauge,, even though I
&gt; prefer the leak down tester,,
&gt; 
&gt; I had a Late Bay bus come into the shop, that had been in another shop after it
&gt; quit in the middle of the intersection right beside their business.
&gt; 
&gt; The customer started to accelerate away at a green light,, and hadn't even got
&gt; the clutch fully out, when it quit, Bang, No go
&gt; He tried the key,, click click click... bummer
&gt; the shop was right at that intersection so the crew of mechanics came out and
&gt; pushed it in... hmm, I guess it needs a battery,, 
&gt; new battery installed,,click click click  nothing,, 
&gt; must need new batter cables,,click click click  nothing,
&gt; geeez! .. well That PROVES it is the starter!! They sent the starter out to get
&gt; it rebuilt as there were no new ones available...  and Talked the customer into
&gt; a &quot;tune Up&quot; while it was waiting to get the starter back...
&gt; Tune Up done...
&gt; Rebuilt starter installed...
&gt; click click click  nothing,
&gt; 
&gt; NOW the customer started to get upset,, he got into a heated discussion and that
&gt; garage decided to tell him to take his car and shove it,, But PAY For it
&gt; first,,, 
&gt; He ended up paying for the parts only,, would not pay for HIS own starter,, so
&gt; they took it off,,,,, 
&gt; He had it towed to where I worked,, 
&gt; 
&gt; I tried to turn it over by hand using the pulley, and it wouldn't turn, 
&gt; I pulled off the rocker cover,, and the spring etc fell out .... the keeper had
&gt; come off the stem, the valve had sucked into the cylinder and been shoved back
&gt; through the head just north of the guide.
&gt; 
&gt; You have to ask,, How can you tune up an air-cooled without setting the
&gt; valves????
&gt; When I got the engine to look at ,, It had been tuned up by professional North
&gt; American mechanics,, they don't adjust valves,,
