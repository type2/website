Subject: Re: [T2] It could be worse... Or could it? (A novella)


&gt;You are letting these mechanics put way too much emphasis on compression
&gt;tests.  If that was all you had to show it was blown when you first had it
&gt;worked on, then that was not enough, and you should have demanded more
&gt;explanation, especially since after 7 years of sitting there could be
&gt;various things wrong that might be correctable without an engine rebuild.
&gt;There is a real art to getting one going that has been sitting for a long
&gt;time but the right techniques can work miracles.  Besides, many auto
&gt;mechanics I've seen use the regular old compression gauge instead of a
&gt;differential type, and this will not give the best determination of where

SNIP:
  Glen: could you elaborate on what you mean by a differential type of
compression gauge?  I've not heard of those.
