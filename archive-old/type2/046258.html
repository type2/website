Alex,

15 gallons sound about right, check the owner's manual.

The float arm on your fuel guage sending unit may be adjusted
incorrectly.  Mine never reaches the full mark,
but runs a long time near empty, giving me a substantial reserve..

When you pull the tank to fix the leaking hoses, fuel filler, left and
right vent hoses, you can adjust or
replace your sending unit out of the vehicle   Adjust even a new one by
wiring it to your guage, grounding  the
brown lead fron the sending unit, and powering the guage.  Since you
drained the tank to remove it, block off
the fuel connection on the bottom of the tank.  Depending on your
preference, fill with one gallon of water at
a time till full watching the indication on the guage for each
additional gallon.  Or just fill with a hose and
bend the float arm until full is full.  I would suggest that setting the
float level to indicate the start of
reserve (right line) on the guage with 3 gallons in the tank as a
conservative reserve, about 60 miles.  If the
guage does not reach all the way to the full mark, it is no big deal. 
You will learn to recognize where full
is.  Besides, doesn't the nervousness increase as the guage approaches
empty.  Make sure you drain the water
when you are done and set the tank, opened up, out in the sun for a
while to evaporate any remaining water.  In
front of a heater will also work.

Some get at the sending unit by cutting a hole in the metal floor of the
bus just above the fuel tank sending
unit.  That won't help you check out, and fix, your leaks, though.  I
won't violate the solid integrity of the metal
floor between the engine/ fuel tank, and the interior on my bus.  It
could be a time saver though.
