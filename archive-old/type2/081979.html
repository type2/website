Subject: Re: [T2] Continued 78 FI air leak.....Im Confused...


&gt;             Im confused.  I took a pic of where the throttle body was
&gt; removed from the intake air manifold.  Just so I know that I am not
&gt; making a stupid mistake..this is the throttle body right?

Correct. The seal is the black rubber inside the end shown in this pic.
And yes, I see the split nipple. I wonder how that happened?!?
If you want another housing with a good nipple, let me know. I can get you one
Saturday.
