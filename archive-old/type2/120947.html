Subject: Re: Subaru engine in Vanagon

Probably shouldn't say anything yet until the birth...but, I'm knee-deep
in doing this to my 78 Westy right now.  Got a Legacy for $600 bux and
gutted it for what I need.  Really looking forward to having A/C and
cruise!  Went the Kennedy Engineered Products route and am very pleased
with their workmanship and customer service.  Go here and search the
library for the engine conversion article &quot;2.2 Subaru Engine in 1984 VW
Westfalia&quot; for a good start on the road.

For the purists, don't worry I won't do anything this radical to my 62
or my 67 21-window!  They are each getting the love and attention they
deserve.  It's a long story that I plan to document, probably next
summer.  But the short story is, Sits 15&quot; over stock (9&quot; custom body
lift, 6&quot; from the tires), running 33&quot; BFG A/T's needs more hp than the
T4 can deliver (at least that I can afford to make it deliver!)

I am posting this question for my brother-in-law, who has an 81 Vanagon
Westy.  He want to replace the original engine with a Subaru engine, and
wants some feedback on the pros and cons of this.  Thanks!
