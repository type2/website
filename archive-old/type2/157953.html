Subject: Front tire wear

OK, So I bought a 78 Bus.  I haven't physically seen it, so I had a friend
pick it up and take it to his favorite (but not VW specialist) mechanic for a
check-out before agreeing to the purchase.  He looked it over and said the
only bad things were (1) bad tire wear on inside of front tires, steering box
going bad and poor handling in the front while driving.  He suggested having
the ball joints replaced and front tires immediately and eventually do the
steering box.

Here's my question.  Based on what I've read in the tech
articles (Ratwell, Type2 et al), tire choice is very important on the bus.
Wrong tires and they won't ride or wear well and possibly strain the steering
box.  So, is the ball joints a dead end and I really just need the right tires
and then fix the steering box?  My friend found another local mechanic that
works VWs (who hasn't seen the van yet) and he says he can replace the ball
joints but he rarely sees these go bad on the bus.

Thanks.
