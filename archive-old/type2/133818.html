Subject: Re: [T2] shift problem.

Hello Gail  Check your rear drums  If they were loose they will eat the 
splines out and the bus wont drive.  Take the hubcaps off and have someone start 
the bus and put it in gear and let out the clutch and check the axle nuts to see 
if they are turning  . Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
