From: &quot;Ted Kitch&quot; &lt;tedkitch_at_tedsgarage_dot_com&gt;
&gt; This is a virus.  Make sure that you delete them without opening them.

Bus Content: We're doing a limited first run on sliding door inner handles.
The &quot;stock&quot; color for our handles is tan, but we can do a variety of colors,
too.  A local club member wants a purple one. :O)

The last one that I got was addressed as if it came from a listee, but it
addressed to &quot;undisclosed-recipients&quot; rather than to quattro_at_audifans_dot_com.

I'm running Nortons AV, which nailed the message, disinfected it, and
indicated that the attached file, &quot;KPG EXHAUST-1864CFM.doc.pif&quot; was infected
with the &quot;W32.Bugbear.B_at_mm&quot; virus.

This is the second time in 30 days that this virus has used listee addresses
to set up false &quot;From:&quot; addresses in infected emails.  It's probably not the
fault of whoever's address is picked by the virus and used to ID the
&quot;sender&quot; of infected messages.
