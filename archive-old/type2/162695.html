&gt; &gt; I used a recessed nut and bolt, trying to remember what they aare called
&gt; &gt; where the nut has a shaft and the bolt goes into it, has worked fine for
&gt; &gt; several years and allows you to swap out the guide without taking all
&gt; &gt; apart.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; took the old rivet to the home center and found a matching set. in the
&gt; &gt; specialty bolts drawers
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Usually, &quot;threaded insert&quot; but good luck at Home Despot... I've found
&gt; that if you're askin' for anything less common than a nail, you're
&gt; usually met by a blank stare... 8-(

I rarely ask those guys, I know the 3 or 4 that have a clue, I rumaged
around in the drawers until I found what I wanted. didn't ask, which is
probably why I couldn't remember what it was,  knew what I needed and
where to find it so looked until I found the one that matched.
