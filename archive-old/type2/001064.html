Subject: Re: [T2] 79 Type2 Not starting after a long drive.

&gt; I have another question.  Yesterday I drove my 79 for about 3 straight
&gt; hours.  I stopped the engine to unload some stuff, than I tried to start
her
&gt; up again... and nothing happened.  I heard a little hum as I turned the
key,
&gt; but the starter never kicked in.

This started happening to me in my '77 on my last road trip.  Banging it
with a hammer or rolling the car and letting out the clutch usually fixed
it.
When I got home I replaced the solenoid thinking it might be weak,
but the problem remained. Then I realized that it would engage if I just
switched the key on and off up to 8 times.   So I took my starter out for a
look over and it looked great.  Then I noticed my battery was low on water
(duh).  So I filled it up and the problem went away.  My theory is that if
your
battery doesn't have enough umph to get the motor moving that's what
happens - all you hear is the hum of the fuel pump.  When the car is hot
it's harder for the starter to turn the motor because all the cables are hot
and their resistances go up.

Good luck,
Christopher Darilek
