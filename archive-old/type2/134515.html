Subject: Aux fan

I was going to install a bilge blower in our bus when I realized that I
still had the aux fan from before the engine switch.

The motor is completely shot.  The shaft pulls in and out about .25&quot; and
moves side to side almost .5&quot;.  Obviously shot.  But the squirrel cage fan
and the housing itself are in tip top shape.  It even has both of the little
flaps.

I searched Bus Depot for the part, but could only find an Auxiliary Fan for
$330.03.  A bit pricey for me, though I'm not sure it's actually the part
that I'm looking for.  The part is labeled &quot;Hot Air Fan&quot; on the fiche
(028-00), part #2.  BTW, The squirrel cage is pressed on, not held on with a
nut like in the fiche.

Is it worth fixing this baby, or should I just go with the bilge blower?
