&gt;67 BUS, shortened by 4', runs good, good brakes, needs minor rust
&gt;repair, does wheelies, $1750 or best offer. (860) 350-3756 Joe or Sue 

I think this one was on display at the Terryville, CT show a couple weeks
ago.  Apparently nobody bought it (I'm shocked!!! ;)

INGREDIENTS IN THE MAKING OF A SHORTENED BUS:

**One bus with rusty middle (preferably very rusty rockers and cargo area,
but decent front and  rear)

**One fun-luvin', mal-adjusted, and/or torch-happy owner

**One plasma-cutter or Sawzall

**A welder to rejoin front with rear

**Time on your hands


Mix the above ingredients thoroughly.  Add a liberal amount of &quot;a flair for
the absurd&quot;.  Try desparately to sell it to circus clowns or cross-eyed bus
lovers.
