Subject: Rabbit oil filter compatibility?

All right, what is the final verdict.  Does the readily availible Rabbit
oil filter fit a VW bus ('77 bus to be exact).   Does it work as well as
the stock Bus oil filter?  Finally, is it easier to get off?  I often have
to poke a hole in my oil filter just to remove it.  I would guess the smaller
rabbit filter may be easier to grab onto.
Any thoughts?
Brett
