Subject: '77 exhaust

First message--hope I'm doing it right....

I've got a '77 Westy and I pulled off the fan housing to clean up oil
and replace seals and stuff and noticed that 1). The &quot;air non return
flaps&quot; (the small metal flaps that used to go in-between the lower fan
ducts and the heat exchangers--according to Bentley diagram) are
missing.  Also one of the heat exchanger clamps (above where a flap was)
is missing and is replaced with a muffler bandage.  And 2). A &quot;heat
shied&quot; is missing on one of my exhaust pipes--at least I think that that
is what is missing.  It is the pipe that bolts to the engine.  On one
side there is a shield piece of metal attached to the pipe as one unit
and on the other side this outer bit is rusted away leaving only an
un-rusted pipe. These are the exhaust pipes right above the lower engine
tin and below the push-rod tubes.

My question is: Do I need these flaps (1) and &quot;heat shield&quot; (2)?  I
called around to local shops and everybody said don't worry about
either, but I am.  What do the flaps do and should I replace the exhaust
pipe or wrap something around it to keep heat from the push-rod tubes?
or what?


Thanks in advance.  The archives have been an immense help to me so far.

Ben
