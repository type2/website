X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

Thanks David,

Not to start an argument, but how did the German's do it on the original
covers?? The wire was in them when I took the old covers off.   Maybe I am
not seeing something here, but I believe when you, not meaning you
personally, but when a company states they make or build to the original
OEM, doesn't that mean to original factory standards??

Bill
