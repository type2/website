Subject: [T2] RE: Volunteer Bug Jam

&gt; Any listees attending the 7th Annual Volunteer Bug Jam in Knoxville this
&gt; weekend?


While we will not be in attendance, The Bus Depot is a major sponsor of this
show.  They will also be raffling off a Westfalia camper which has a lot of
donated Bus Depot parts on it (with the proceeds to help fund the show and
the local VW club that sponsors it). Maybe a listmember will win the camper!

If you stop by the NVWSA booth (where the camper is, I believe), you can
pick up a free copy of our new Catalog (which is usually available only for
a charge).
