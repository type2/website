&gt; &quot;well when I rebuilt the engine I used a brand new hyd cam.  used the old
&gt; lifters but one failed and I replaced it with a brand new lifter.&quot;

&gt; My point exactly.

the lifter that failed was a broken spring in the lifter,, only problem I
have had with hyd lifters in the 12 years I've owned this van..
