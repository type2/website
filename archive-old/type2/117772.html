Subject: update...78 bus and vacuum readings

Thanks to all who responded with tips.

Bought some starter fluid yesterday at lunch...when i got home, I put on a 
long sleeved shirt, my organic vapor mask, leather gloves and had my 
fire extinguisher in the other hand.

Guys, I sprayed the daylights out of the intake area on both heads(covers 
injector seals and head gaskets).  I sprayed the throttle body and up and 
down the s stube.  I sprayed the plenum area all over.....nothing...

So...I don't have a vacuum leak anywhere(brakd booster conn was plugged  
as well).

I took my gauge out to my 68 sp and hooked it up to the carb...the port 
that faces directly to the rear...and get nearly 20&quot; of vacuum.  I can't 
remember if that port is above or below the throttle plate, but had to be 
below for that kind of reading....so it's not the gauge.

So, I decided to get forget it for awhile and get some more miles on the 
engine.  I will check the temp sensor on the head this evening as I have a 
new one and it is probably the one thing on the whole engine that I did 
not replace....but *did* test....although it did read a little low when I 
tested it.  Since it regulates the pulse width of the injectors when cold, 
if it has gotten very far off, then it may be lying to the ecu and 
saying that the engine is warm when it is not.

More updates as they occur...

Thanks ,dave
