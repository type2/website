Subject: Re: [T2] Backwards dist. drive

Be sure to rock the motor back and forth with a wrench - that is slightly 
rotate the engine back and forth while you pull.

You might even clean the hole with carb cleaner, and glue the pencil in, 
pull out the drive, and then drill out the pencil later (wouldn't require 
any real effort nor damage the drive as the pencil wood would &lt;!&gt; 
disintegrate before the metal of the drive).

Some of the resistance that the drive will give seemed to be related to the 
stickiness of the oil.

BE SURE none of the shims falls into the engine.

I have removed about 5 or 6 this way. Really any wooden dowel would do the 
job if it fit tightly.

&gt;I saw that tip in the Muirs book I just bought used. The correct tool is
&gt;expensive and a pain in the ass to use. I found the gear was kind of hard to
&gt;pull out when I did it with the tool. I wonder if the pencil will hold
&gt;strongly enough in the hole for a sticky gear? I'll try it next time if I
&gt;have to do it again. Somebody else suggested a strong magnet, which sounds
&gt;workable if it's not stuck. Tom

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;If it is positioned wrong, you simply lift it up off of its mating gear,
&gt; &gt; &gt;rotate it, and drop it down in the correct position.  The
&gt; &gt; &gt;complicating factor is that it takes a special tool to get hold of the
&gt; &gt; &gt;drive gear.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You can pull the drive out of the engine with a blunt end #2 pencil. Just
&gt; &gt; go buy a pack, they're cheap - I ruined a couple before I got the drive
&gt;out
&gt; &gt; of the '81 Beetle engine I had problems with.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I sent this little blurb to the Muir folks while I was stationed in
&gt;Naples,
&gt; &gt; Italy and they actually printed it in the back of the 'Compleat Idiot'
&gt;book
&gt; &gt; in the 'Hints and Techniques' Section in back.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Found this edition of the book in a book store in Key West, FL while my
&gt; &gt; ship was in port and I got so excited I showed everyone near me - guess I
&gt; &gt; looked like a real looney. I don't normally send things to publishers...
&gt;Or
&gt; &gt; get things printed in magazines or books.
