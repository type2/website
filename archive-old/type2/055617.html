Subject: bottom door roller bracket needed '72

Hi All, 
	Just figured out why my sliding door on my '72 is a pain to close.
The bracket with the roller on the bottom front corner of my sliding door 
is in three pieces!  Anyone have a good one lying around?  How about an 
entire rust free door?  Let me know what ya have and what ya want.  I am 
near AnnArbor Michigan.  The zip is 48170
Thanks.
ED
