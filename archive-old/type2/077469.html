Subject: Re: Free '74 Camper in Philadephia

&gt; I have decided that I need to get rid of my camper, a white 74, that has
&gt; been sitting in my yard for two years now. I am in Germantown,
&gt; Philadelphia, and the bus is yours (or anyones) for the asking. The engine
is broken
&gt; down in the garage, as I was tearing it down for a rebuild. The body is in
&gt; okay shape, but has a rusted out front axle. Let me know if you are
&gt; interested.

If this is an original white Westy it should have the blue &amp; green plaid 
interior.  This would be the same as my '74 Westy, but the outside paint on 
mine is Yosemite Yellow.

In my opinion the blue &amp; green plaid which was only offered in the Yellow or 
White Westy in '74 &amp; '75 is the nicest interior and layout offered in any 
baywindow Westy.  Someone should jump on this if it is a candidate for 
restoration.
