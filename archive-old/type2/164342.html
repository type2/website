Subject: Re: [WetWesties] Is Les Schwab still selling their Jupiter
  tire?

Thanks Bill! I have chains for the really bad stuff, but since we have the
same climate as you in Seattle, (I'm in Nanaimo on Vancouver Island) the
occassional 3-5 days of yearly snow makes getting these a pretty safe bet. I
suspect the rubber compound on these is quite hard then, so would expect good
mileage from them. How are yours looking after 2 years? What miles have you
put on them?
Regards,
Courtney

  Just wondering if Les Schwab is still selling their Load Range D tire for
  our Westies? I believe it was called a Jupiter? Also known as a Signet,
  WooSung, and something else. I believe they were excellent value at the
55-65 dollar
  range?

  I bought a set of Jupiters 2 years ago from Les Schwab for my '76 and while
  they're a very good tire I wouldn't call them a great tire. They're fine for
  normal use and have enough side wall stiffness to keep your Westy feeling
  comfortable in a cross wind. They're excellent in the rain and roll well at
all
  speeds. But, they're not so hot on ice and snow as well as mud. I got bogged
  down at Sammamish State Park in slick grass and mud this past May coming
back
  from the Cruise for the Cure and needed a push from several bystanders to
get
  going again. Although part of the problem was my hesitation in crossing the
  slippery area. If I had speeded up instead of slowing down I probably would
  have made it across OK. And, earlier in the year when we had some snow and
ice
  in the Seattle area, about 3-4&quot; at our house, I had problems on a hill near
  our house. Had to park the bus and then come back with a shovel to clear a
  path for the tires. So, if you're going to be doing some serious ice and
snow
  driving and/or off-roading in muddy conditions you might want to pass on the
  Jupiters. But, for normal every-day usage, they can't be beat.
