&gt; Think &quot;roof rack.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; No, not for the cargo, for the kids.  8o)

Wow, what a greate idea!  This in one of the reasons I haven't seriously
sound-proofed the bus yet... the kids have to scream to get my attention
and I can always feign road-deafness if I don't feel like answering
them.  What really gets me is when they all yell a question in
chorus--pretty hard to ignore.  Also a reason we don't keep the middle
seat installed--they'd be sitting too close to the front seats...

So how many kids under 12 can you strap to a roof rack?

As many as are BUGGING the boogers out of you at the time?
