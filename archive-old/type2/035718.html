Subject: Re: Bus Insulation

Gentlepersons-
                       Careful about insulating the front doors on your 
bus...There are holes
in the bottom of the doors to allow water to exit. Come spring remove the 
inner panel
and have someone else run a garden hose on the closed door. The seals around 
the win-
dow leak...even more so now that they're 20 or more years old. The doors were 
meant to drain. Adding fiberglass could plug the drains. I've got a mylar 
faced closed cell self adhesive rubber on the door skin. But only after 
liberally coating the inside with POR-15
paint.
