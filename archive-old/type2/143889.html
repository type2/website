Subject: Re: [T2] oil pressure sender

if it is the oil pressure switch under the dizzy it is anywhere from a 21mm to a 27 mm depending on which one is there that you have installed.... some take the big gm socket and some are smaller mm its a special socket i had to search for one that big around here was a tuff find.. napa ended up having it....?
if you are refering to the sender for the oil pressure temp gauge??? 17mm???? 19mm just a guess?
you know how to test if its good or not dont you?
good luck to you...
peace and love
chris
