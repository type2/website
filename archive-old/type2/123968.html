Subject: re New Mexican thermostats, new Empi axles for buses

I just got my bus back running down the road finally. I can give my personal
impressions of some interesting new parts available to anyone who's
interested.
I installed a pair of the new Empi complete bus axles, so far I have about 100
miles only on them, but they appear to be of excellent quality. Open the box,
and bolt them on, grease is ready to go.

Re the new Mexican thermostat kits being sold by CIP- It took some doing, but
I scared up all the parts for a complete flap and thermostat assembly for my
single port head-doghouse cooler engine. (thanks to Karl for the 1 flap
assembly and the great Hoover bit)  I had my fingers crossed on this
conversion, would the thermostat fit and work with single port heads, Cool
Tins,  etc.??
It fit right up and works like a champ! I took the bus down the highway today
and it is running nice and cool, just as cool as it ran with no flaps or
anything else. The entire thermostat kit is genuine VW/Audi in factory
packaging, everything you need from the thermostat right up to the loop the
rod goes through on the flaps.
Not sure if it would work with type 4 engines, but I think I read somewhere
that someone was trying to come up with a kit.
