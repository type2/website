&gt;One of my books suggests a 'poor mans' version of a compression test
&gt;from which overall state of each cylinder may be infered.
&gt;
&gt;You will need a tachometer (the same one you use for your tuneups), 4
&gt;three inch wires bared at each end, and a jump lead.
&gt;
&gt;Take the HT leads off the distributor (one at a time so they dont get
&gt;mixed up) and as you replace them insert the short peices of wires.
&gt;You end up with four bare ends stiking out of the top of the distributor
&gt;one for each cylinder. Ensure the aren't touching anything. Put one end
&gt;of the jump lead onto a good earth. Connect the tacho.

Why is it you can/should not just pull a spark plug wire off the cap
while the motor is running?  I thought I heard someone say that was
bad, but don't remember why?

thanks,
    brandy
