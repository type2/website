Subject: wire terminal numbers

Terminal X is hot with the ignition on. It's used to
feed the headlight switch on vehicles that switch the
headlights off when the ignition is off. I've never
been clear on exactly which models used this system.

Steve Elms

&gt;One of the harnesses coming from the ignition switch
&gt;has several DIN terminal designations, and lo! they
&gt;are just as you said, Su, X, etc. I've been able to
&gt;determine what 50, 30 and others are, but not the Su 
&gt;or X. As to the website that someone posted, neither
&gt;Su or X are listed.  Anyone know what they relate to?
