According to the Haynes manual for my '80 here are the numbers:
width non Pick-up   1845mm or for the metrically challenged 72.7&quot;
width Pick-up         1870mm again for the challenged          73.6&quot;
  
&gt; To further perpetuate this trivial thread, I would suggest:  Does anyone
&gt; have the statistics on hand for early vanagons ('80, '81, etc.)?  If they
&gt; are the same as for the '79, that would further the theory that the '79
&gt; figures are for the vanagon and not the baywindow.
