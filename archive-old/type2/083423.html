Subject: Anyone traveling thru....

Is anyone traveling through Alexandria, VA down south in an westardly
direction (say toward Nashville, TN). I might lift an engine from the
hands of Steve Dolan. Problem is I don't have a free weekend anytime
near now, to drive the distance. I was hoping someone might have a
course that could perhaps move this motor to a lower lattitude :)

TIA.
