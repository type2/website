Subject: need help engine removal type 1

Listees-

This is a call for help with a ghia, but I know bus people are the best, so here goes...
I need help. My ghia is in the shop getting body work done and a paint job. For it to be completed correctly the engine needs to come out of it. A friend was going to help me pull it at the shop, but he's pretty much been a no show. 
Anyone on the list have any interest in helping me take the motor out of my 67 ghia? The car is located in Southern Maryland, about 30 miles south of DC. I need to have it pulled asap (like this week or weekend) as it is holding up the works in getting the car finished. I'm willing to pay a reasonable price and provide tools. 

Many thanks, 
Melissa
