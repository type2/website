When I was a young fellow and just starting out on this road of mechanic
madness, I was so paranoid about a car falling on me that I hated to get under
the car even when it was sitting on all four wheels.  I gradually got over this
as my attention became absorbed with the work at hand and the attendant cuts
bruises, sweat in the eyes, dirt and oil in the face, etc.   Today I need to
remind myself of the danger of being under a car, but I still block the wheels,
put in the jackstands AND put the roller jack under a strong central support
spot.  Then I can go about my business under the car without worry or haste.
I have had cars fall off of jackstands...it is no joke.
