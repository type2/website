Interesting. If you select &quot;about us&quot; their address is obscured by the picture they macked from thesamba_dot_com image gallery. Based on the area code and the letter B I will guess Baltimore, MD. Bob(access systems) do you know these guys?

They scanned a parts book to use for the parts diagrams. I like the layout. I also would like to hear any feedback from folks who have used them as a parts source.
