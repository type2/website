&gt; I am planning to lower my camper, using the tried &amp; tested method of
&gt; fitting a Foksy adjuster.

Not such a good idea.  This method will result in a rough ride,
possible damage to the ball joints, and strange wheel alignment and
tire wear problems.  

If you must lower your bus, use lowering spindles as this is the only
method that preserves the suspension travel and steering geometry.

 However, I've just read the &quot;How To&quot; article in
&gt; Volksworld and it says you need a heavy duty balljoint splitter,
27mm and
&gt; 36mm combination spanners, and possibly a 7lb and 28lb hammer! 

A 28 pound hammer?!  Even John Henry (the legendary greatest steel
drivin' man ever) wouldn't use such a monster!  If this is
Volksworld's best advice, I wouldn't take their word on &quot;tried and
tested&quot; mods.

&gt; The large
&gt; hammer is apparently for 'persuading' the beam off once all the
nuts, etc,
&gt; are undone.

Heck, if you have someone who could swing a 28-pounder, you needn't
trouble yourself with removing the bolts first!

&gt; Is there anybody who's replaced a beam and can tell me what tools I do
&gt; need? I have (what I thought was) a well-stocked tool cabinet, but
these
&gt; tools are going to set me back quite a bit (I mean, those size
spanners are
&gt; a fortune!)

You won't need a hammer to remove the beam, nor can I think of any
fasteners that require wrenches bigger than 17 or 19mm

&gt; And does the beam just drop out once the bolts are undone, or
&gt; do you really need to force it out with a sledgehammer (sounds
dangerous in
&gt; the confines underneath a bus).

No hammer required, but have a couple of friends handy to help catch
the beam.  It's pretty heavy.

&gt; Any help, hints, etc. on this will be warmly received - hopefully if
I have
&gt; the bottle I'll go ahead this weekend with it.

Other than &quot;Don't do it, leave it stock&quot;  I don't have much.  Hit all
the fasteners you can with penetrating oil every few hours for a
couple of days before you work on them.
