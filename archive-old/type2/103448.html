Subject: EveryBus 2003 Feedback

Hi,

Everybus is coming up in about 6 weeks. In an attempt to salvage the 
event and its location for the 5th annual EB I made the decision the 
author the EveryBus riot act - www.everybus_dot_com. Feedback was mixed. 
Some folks were quite grateful and others were put off by it. Some 
who would attend that have no issues complying with park regs will 
not attend because the feel the spirt of the riot act is not 
congruent with that of VW bus camping. I respect their opinions and 
in part I agree.

Below is an excerpt form a reply that I wrote to one person who has 
decided not to attend on principle.  I am glad they contacted me to 
express their decision and opinion.

&quot;I agree that fellowship is the key point of VW bus camping events.
However, at recent events the small but visible &quot;party element &quot; is starting to
outshine the VW bus fellowship. EB 2002 is a good example of a small group of
people behaving badly that jeopardized EBs standing with the park
management.

I have personally invested a lot of effort and personal resources into EB
over that past 5 years. Hundreds folks have invested their time and money
to attend. I strongly feel that I should make an effort to ensure that their
stay is pleasant and returns the personal and material investment that
they made to attend.

The riot act is meant to tip the balance back in the favor of people who
want to camp, enjoy their buses, have fellowship with others of similar
interests while maintaining a reasonable amount civility and respect for each
other, the facility and staff of HST.&quot;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To put it another way, the riot act was intended to separate the 
signal from the noise. It appears some of the signal was lost in the 
process and I am sorry for that.

At this point I need to get a realistic idea of who is planning on 
attending so I can finalize some planning issues. In the past the 
carabus list has been helpful but I have not added that feature to 
the web site this year due to time constraints. If you are planning 
on attending please let me know.

Thanks
Chris
