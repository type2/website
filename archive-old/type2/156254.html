Subject: Re: [T2] engine wiring harness wanted

if you dont find one it is pretty easy to make you one out of the right gauge wire....
   
  i had to make my own after mine grounded out and i couldnt find a harness and when i did i had already done it myself....
   
  bought everything needed at local radio shack..
  peace

  the engine wiring harness has so many splices in it
from whomever worked on it in the past it is a
nightmare, anyone have one for a 1977 2.0 FI? Maybe
this is why my van stalls once in a blue moon, maybe
not, but I just want to make it stock looking, so its
easier to work on, and will look alot cleaner in
there.
