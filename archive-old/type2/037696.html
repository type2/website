Subject: Carb Icing ?

     Sorry for this but just remembered another unrelated bus prob.
As i was driving home along with the brake warning light snag the bus was
sluggish at low rpms and would stall at a stop.
Checking at home (45 min drive) i noticed the right hand intake manifold(73
westy dual stock carbs) was white,
Ice! Man i thought the type 4 with the short manifolds was almost immune to
this but it was ice.
Would this cause the stalling?

Cure?

Thanks Again All
