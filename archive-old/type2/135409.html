Subject: Re: [T2] Mallory

there is no comparison of a Unilite with a/any stock distributor. To further
clarify, &quot;any distributor&quot; includes MSD, or any other distributor made for
or by VW, for the Aircooled Flat-4 VW engine. Yes, &quot;any&quot; means ANY. No
exceptions. Yes, that one too. And that one! #$)&amp;*#)(*&amp;

The power increase was related to the DISTRIBUTOR. A CDI or other secondary
ignition upgrade can work with a unilite or a stock distributor, they are
not required when you change distributors. The power increase Jake Raby has
seen time and time again, and that I have seen in-the-vehicle, is exclusive
of a secondary ignition upgrade. The power increase is related DIRECTLY to
properly setup distributors. Any of them. And once again, &quot;any&quot; means ANY.
Yes, that one too. :-)

I am also confused. I do not understand how I can be coming across as
&quot;unclear&quot; or leaving some room for interpretation. If I'm any more blunt
I'll surely be viewed as a $)*(#&amp; by many reading these posts. I am FINISHED
with this topic for fear of this being the case.
