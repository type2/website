Subject: [T2] fender flares

  What year did VW flare out the rear fenders on the Bus. I know the
68-7? had a little flare, but what year did it grow to finnal size, was
it 71? or 72? The reason I need to know is that I need new fender
openings and want to know if some off a 73 will work on my 71. Thanks

71 Westy
72 Super
76 Super 'Vert Triple White
