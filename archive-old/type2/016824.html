Subject: about those NOS heat exchangers

About those NOS heat exchangers the Bus Depot is selling:

I don't know how Ron does it. His prices for those can't be around for
long.

I believe to know where these heat exchangers originate from. About 3
years ago NOS original heat exchangers swamped the european market. I
won't go into the reasons for this, but a friend of mine bought 3000 by
himself. He sold them through his shop. I myself bought 70 together with
some friends.
To the best of my knowledge there was only one major source for these
(and one smaller one) but they spread real fast and there are none left.
After the appearance of these heat exchangers the price naturally
collapsed because they were all over. 
By now the market has absorbed the parts that were sold for dumping
prices and the prices are rising again. They can only go up.

The price that Ron is currently charging would even be a good price on a
european parts market, let alone the shipping.
I would never sell mine for Rons price. He's really dumping. You gotta
love him.

If anyone has an NOS 79 Bus California left heat exchanger, I would be
willing to some serious trading though.
