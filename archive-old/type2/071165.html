Subject: Loss of power - fuel pump?
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

It happened again on the (cold!) way home this morning.  Driving along
everything seems fine, then suddenly the engine seems to just go to idle
regardless of where the pedal is, I described this before as loss of power, I
guess it is, anyway, it seems to go to idle and start shaking all around
because I am usually in 3rd or 4th and engine idle is not enough to keep it
going in those gears.  I usually put it in neutral and pump the gas a little,
and it goes a way for a little bit.  I have no idea what the problem is.  My
fuel pump was &quot;repaired&quot; not replaced, so I am thinking maybe a fuel delivery
problem, or timing maybe?  Any ideas would help keep my from having heart
attacks when I lose power all of a sudden.

Thanks,
Tripps
