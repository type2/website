&gt;[...]
&gt;I bought my first 1971 in 1978 and everything was original.  The was no way you
&gt;could open the hatch from the inside and there was no tug knob.  I saw several
&gt;71's in junkyards twenty years ago and never have I seen one with a tug knob that
&gt;unlocked the hatch.  The only Westfalia I saw with an original equipment lever for
&gt;opening the hatch from the inside was my in-laws 1970.  The wood panel was
&gt;specially cut to expose the lever on the lock.

Great info! Thanks for setting the record straight. My hatch presently
has no paneling whatever and the exposed latch hardware looked suspiciously
ready for a knob or such. Now that you mention it, I don't remember seeing any
inside access to the latch on previous buses either.

But I like the non-stock option of opening it from the inside and your rod idea is a keeper! &lt;G&gt;
