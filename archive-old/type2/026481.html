&gt;I notice that the 3/8 wrench goes from about 5 to 80 ft/lbs.,
&gt;whereas the 1/2 goes from 25 to 250.  Which one would be 
&gt;a better purchase, and if I go for the 1/2 inch drive, then what 
&gt;about the proper torques below 25 ft/lbs.?  I can't afford both.

If you're only going to buy 1, then definitely go with the 5 - 80 pounder.
There's only a few nuts/bolts that get torqued to more than 80.  They're
important ones, but I'd rather not strip out my small case bolts and know
that I've got my heads torqued right then wonder if those heavy-duty ones
(the ones that you just tighten down 'really damned tight') are just right.

I prefer the 'click' type wrenches to the lever-arm type.  It's damned hard
to watch that needle while your holding the engine and applying torque at
the same time.  With the click type, you listen/feel for the click while
your eyes are free to watch other things.

My opinion and your mileage may vary (disclaimer).
