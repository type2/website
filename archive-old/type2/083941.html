Subject: Re: [T2] steering question

Hi Greg,

It sounds like the castoring action of the wheels has not been set correctly, this is how much the contact point of the wheel with the ground is behind the pivot point of the wheel.
I'm sure a purusal of Bently manual will tell you how to set it. If that wrong then have a carefull check of the toe-in and camber too.

Good luck

&gt; 
&gt; After spending mucho $$$ on complete front end rebuild, the front end is 
&gt; nice and tight!....as a matter of fact, it's TOO tight....after turning a 
&gt; corner, the steering wheel does not return to normal forward position 
&gt; easily.  What could be causing this?  Is the whole front end just too 
&gt; tight?  The mechanic and I have adjusted the steering box in both 
&gt; directions with no effect.  Any opinions?  tx...
