Hey Volks,
	It took five guys to help me carry my type IV 1800 into the basement
and now that I am working on it, I have some questions about the rusty
exhaust. 
1) What does the EGR filter do? Does it help the engine run better? Is it
good for the environment? What would happen if I just left it off?
2) My heat exchangers have some holes in them where they meet up with the
exhaust pipes. Have any of you used exhaust tape for this? Other than
welding in new metal, what options do I have? 
3) My exhaust is pretty rusty, but other than the heat exchangers, there are
no holes anywhere else. I want to take a wire brush and scrape all the rust
off and paint my exhaust. I saw some paint at Wal-Mart that says it is for
exhaust. It is supposed to withstand temps up to 1100 degrees. Have any of
you used this before?   
Thanks,
Joel
