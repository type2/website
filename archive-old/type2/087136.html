Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Booster removal; replacement

Chuck,

I just read the same thing after I removed mine and cleaned it up and 
painted it.

I'll know sometime this weekend&lt;grin&gt;.

I think it is one of those &quot;german&quot; things.  I couldn't see how removing 
it and reinstalling it could make a difference.


Cheers ,dave

&gt; I am about to remove my brake servo and my steering dampner to use one of
&gt; rustybus' tow bars. (It clamps to the crossbeam and these items would
&gt; interfere with it, which is not uncommon with towbars.)
&gt; 
&gt;  In my Bentley manual, it yells at you that if you remove this item, you
&gt; must rebuild it (replace the filter, a seal and o-rings).
&gt; 
&gt;  Is that strictly correct? Can I safely remove this thing and put it back
&gt; the way I found it, without doing that? Any advice?
&gt; 
&gt; I sure don't want to spend the $160 or so to get a rebuilt one...after I
&gt; screw it up.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
