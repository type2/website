Subject: Re: [T2] '71 westy interior question

There is NO countertop on the sink on my 71 Westy. I'm 99% sure that my Westy is all-original.  Are you 100% sure you have a Westfalia camper?  Are you sure its from a 71?  Do you mean the table on the side of the cabinet where the sink lives?  Or is my Sink maybe missing something??  All these questions ;^)
Peace, John Baker

Hi Everyone,
    I have a question regarding the camping interior in our '71.  When I
open the countertop on the sink, it goes past  horizontal by 15 or 20
degrees.  Is there suposed to be some kind of support on the aisle side of
the sink/icebox cabinet to support the opened countertop?  My cabinet does
have some small holes drilled on that side of it, as if there were screws.
Right now the metal hinges rest against the side of the cabinet when the top
is open, is that right?
