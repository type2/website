I dunno, I'm one for one with them.  Best price, the right stuff, fast and
convenient.  Only thing they haven't done yet is answer an email question
about hatch rubber.  But the parts are fine.  Talk to them, I'd say.  Small
businessfolk live and die on satisfied customers, and I bet they'll bend
over backwards to make it right as they can.
