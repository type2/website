&gt; Your not the only one, though the vast majority of posts seem to
&gt; be positive.
&gt;
&gt; I ordered a 10mm head stud kit from them.  It was dropped shipped from
&gt; RMMW.  When after a week it didn't arrive I called BD and they said they
&gt; meant to call and let me know it had been delayed...
&gt; when I finally got around to installing them, I find out RMMW
&gt; mislabeled eight 10x188's as 10x240, making my set only half complete.  BD
&gt; said to send them back and they would refund me, which is cool.  I got the
&gt; impression that the late date was not a problem, but they weren't exactly
&gt; willing to replace, only to refund.  They told me that if I
&gt; wanted to order the correct studs that I would have to go direct, not
through them.
&gt;
&gt; I get the impression that they are a bit overworked at the Bus Depot.  I
&gt; will however continue to order from them.


I thought I'd explain how your order from The Bus Depot gets processed, in
the hopes that some insight will help you better understand how most orders
get delivered so quickly, while others get delayed. This is a bit of a long
e-mail, so hit delete if it doesn't interest you.

RMMW (more accurately, their wholesale subsidiary) is but one of about
fifteen different suppliers I use, including Volkswagen, West Coast Metric,
a dozen large-volume importers, and several small manufacturers.  I pick and
choose among them, based on quality, price, and speed of delivery, so if you
order six items from me, they may have come from four different sources
depending on who had the best deal on each one.  For example, RMMW's front
door seal kits are a great value, but their rear engine lid seal is twice
the price of WCM's, and their rear hatch seal is merely a rebadged VW seal
that I can get cheaper elsewhere.  I also love to play one supplier against
the other and see who can come up with the lowball price.  As a result,
you'll always pay less than the prices charged by RMMW, WCM, etc.

Some orders ship from my shop in Pa., while others drop-ship directly from
the supplier.  I'm a big fan of dropshipping orders when possible.  If a
customer in, say, California, orders a brake drum, and I can get a
wholesaler in California to ship it right to him, he gets it much faster and
cheaper than if I sent it all the way from Pa. That's why you'll sometimes
see incredulous posts to the list by someone 1000 miles away from me who
ordered a part and it showed up the next morning. The wholesalers are not
crazy about dropshipping because it's a lot of extra work for their shipping
departments.  But in many cases, I am one of their largest wholesale
accounts, so they deal with it.  The exception is very small orders (such as
those head studs), which are just too small for them to be willing to
dropship.  With an item like that, which is not a stocking item for me, I'd
have to add it to my stock order, and then re-ship it to the customer.
Depending on where I get this part from, this can take a day (some of my
suppliers ship to me via overnight air), or a week (if that part is coming
from a supplier who only ships via ground).  I almost always know which is
the case, and do my best to warn my customers if an item they have ordered
will not be in for a week.  Of course you can always ask me when ordering.

The downside to drop-shipping is that once in a while (albeit rarely) a lack
of communication can occur. If a wholesaler is out of one of the items he
was supposed to dropship, he is supposed to let me know right away so I can
ship that part from here (assuming I have it or can get it elsewhere).
Usually this works well, but once in a while an item gets backordered
without my knowledge.  So if you place an order, and receive only a partial
drop-shipment, it is extremely likely that the balance of the order is
shipping from here and will arrive a few days later.  But in the rare case
where it doesn't show up a few days later, it  never hurts to check in with
me just in case.

Steve is right that we are horribly overworked.  The new webite (hopefully
beta-testing next week) should solve this, as it will allow you to get
prices and order right over the internet, reducing my phone call volume
tremendously.  This will allow me to focus on getting your order to you
quickly and cheaply, rather than quoting prices.  Of course I'll let you
know when this happens.  Meanwhile, the best option is still to call, at
(215) 234-VWVW. Do be patient; we try to answer calls as quickly as possible
but during certain hours call volume can far exceed manpower.
