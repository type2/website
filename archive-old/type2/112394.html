&lt;&lt; OTOH, Dealers are no guarantee of quality.  A friend had his Toyota
serviced at the dealer and when he got home found no oil on the dipstick.
Took the car back to the dealer and found that there was only 1.5 quarts
in the 5-quart sump.  Seems that their automatic filling nozzle had
malfunctioned and dispensed only 1.5 quarts no matter what the dial said.

The scariest thing was their attitude:  &quot;Yeah, it does that now and
then...&quot;

From another list:
One of the list members (who works for a rather upscale auto firm from
Sweden) reports that the &quot;trend&quot; in dealership service is to only employ
one or two &quot;technicians&quot; (defined as someone who can read the read out
from the self-diagnosing cars) and leaves a memo on the car for the low-
er paid grunt...i.e. &quot;remove and replace gizmo A-98765&quot;... ;-(
The &quot;gizmo&quot; however, could come from an off-shore factory with a &quot;Brand-
Name&quot; that doesn't even pay it's workers a salary...Could just be piece 
work...A certain number of gizmos must be assembled per hour to make 
anything like a wage...Good, bad, or indifferent... ;-(
