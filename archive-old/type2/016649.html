&gt; What's the most cost-efficient way to accomplish this?
Michael:
Talk to United Van Lines or other household movers. You might have to
repack it into smaller packages, but it might be worth it. Reportedly
they are very reasonable for shipping motorcycles. Also I shipped a 911
engine on a pallet from Iowa to the west coast and it was appr. $150.
That was probably 10 years ago though. I think the rate you pay per/cwt
is largely determined by your description of the goods. It seemms like
USED AUTO PARTS was the best rate in my case.
