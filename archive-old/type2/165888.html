Subject: Re: [T2] Re: theorerectially looking for hypthesis(dropped
  exhaust valve?)

finally pulled off the pushrod tube.  took way too long, but i didn't
damage it.  yea, saved some money.  could see the solid lifter up
close and personal.  still with the magnet couldn't pull it out.  too
frustrated to try pulling off the #4 intake pushrod tube.  does anyone
have a good picture(s) of a good solid lifter?  views from the top and
bottom, side, all that?  i'll check the web and see what i can find.
took off the header and look up at the exhaust valve.  looked just
like the #3 except for the bad combustion residue.  would bad
combustion be a by product of (hah) whatever it is that is wrong?
stupid question, i know.  sorry.


thanks, again everyone.
