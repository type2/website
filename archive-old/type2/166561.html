By Jove, Jamie, I think you're onto something!  Instead of pulling the bike with the bus, I'll pull the bus with the bike.  Brilliant!  Better aerodynamics and better power to boot.  But uh oh, what happens in one of those nasty crosswinds??  Maybe not. :)

 Cheers...KR

&gt; Three or four years ago, I didn't need my Honda Goldwing anymore.  A good &gt;friend of mine had been begging me to sell it to him so I did.   I've been &gt;trying to get him to sell it back to me.  Well, I finally caught him in a &gt;moment of financial embarrassment  and he sold it to me.  &gt;WHHOOOPPPPEEEEE!   Same price and he did a bunch of upgrades to it. 
 

&gt;Now I have an excuse to get a trailer and a Jamie Rivers hitch set-up and hit the road.  Well, If I could only get out of Chattanooga.  :)  Have a great weekend!  KR   
&gt; 
 

Ahhh,, the point of owning a bike is to ride it....   ;)
I don't make hitches for Goldwings....
so I am assuming you are going to put a hitch on the Bus,, and tow your 
Goldwing??
your motto...??  we haul our rides everywhere.  I won't tell you the acronym 
for that cause I can't spell acronym..
