&gt; well..while at the shop today I got a lot more work done...I'll get even
&gt; more work done tonight...by the end of the night the bus will be ready
&gt; to weld up.
&gt; I cut out the drivers side rocker (what was left of it) and the inner
&gt; rocker as it was rusted to bits...
&gt; after getting through the inch deep bondo and fiberglass sheet...I found
&gt; something I never want to see again...
&gt; PAPER BAGS wadded up inside the rocker to support the bondo!!!!  I must
&gt; have pulled out 2 bags or more.._dot_cardboard etc..!!! still damp too!!!
&gt; wow...I couldn't believe it.
&gt;
&gt; so I will be ordering my metal soon and welding it up and putting the
&gt; bus back together....
&gt;
&gt; tip of the day : don't shove paper bags inside of your rockers.
