&gt; I've put myself in a big hole this time...
&gt; 
&gt; Yesterday I pulled off the drivers side axle to replace both cv boot
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, I can get the circlips on the axle, but when I push the
&gt; joint back 
&gt; and forth on the axle, the circlip flies off.  This leads me to
&gt; believe the 
&gt; circlip is useless and will not hold the joint to the axle while on
&gt; the car.  
&gt; Am I right?
&gt; 
&gt; Last time, I did not &quot;test&quot; the circlips strength.  I guess the
&gt; bottom line 
&gt; is these circlips need to be on the axle and must stay put, right?

OK, you just need to get the circlips on better.  Pull the joint back
off, make sure that the circlip groove is squeaky-clean and free of
burrs.  Find a socket that just fits over the splined end of the axle. 
Put the CV back on (omit the dished washer, per VW's modified
instructions), then install a _new_ circlip.  One face of the circlip
may be rounded a bit, and this face should be facing toward the CV
joint.  Support the opposite end of the axle with a block of wood, put
the socket over the end of the shaft (resting on the circlip) and give
it a firm tap with a brass hammer (or a block of wood).  This serves to
seat the circlip in its groove.

Another handy circlip tip:  Before installing the circlip, use a small
carbide cutter in a dremel tool to put a pair of small notches in the
end of the ring.  Now the ring will behave when using circlip pliars to
spread it for installation.  No more tearing the shop apart to find a
ring that has flown the coop!
