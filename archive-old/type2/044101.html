kim-
for a heat shield,working on the principle that air is an insulator,
you might find a metal wrap with a clamp ( food container or aluminum
roof flashing-type material) . cut two slots for the clamp to grab the solenoid.
a firm grip on the solenoid will hold the cylinder, and a loose fit around the starter
is OK, the ends being open for obvious reasons...hey, i gotta try that myself...
