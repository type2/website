Subject: 73 Westy; What to strip off?
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

My son and I are getting a 75 Westy back on the road. I have the opportunity 
to get a parts bus (73 Westy) really cheap. The problem is that I can't keep 
it on my property due to landlord restrictions. I will have about one week's 
grace before I get a nastygram.

This bus is missing the engine and has the front end/windshield smashed.

I want the front brakes, the master cyl, tranny and drive shafts, steering 
box, a few interior parts and a few body panels.

Would anyone on the list who is experienced with the topic of &quot;needed spares&quot; 
wish to suggest what might be useful to remove and store against possible 
future need? I have limited storage space, so things like the front beam and 
camping gear aren't possibel for me. I'm thinking more of mechanical gadgets 
that break frequently.
