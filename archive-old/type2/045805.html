Subject: [T2] Removing Fan Hub - Late Bus
Content-Disposition: inline

I've always used a $7 harmonic balancer puller for this job and it's always
worked. I guess it wouldn't if the thing was really
stuck. But I just stick the center shaft into the middle of the hub, use a few
M8 case parting bolts instead of what they give
you with the puller, a few flat washers so the bolt heads don't get pulled
through the puller, then stick the 3 bolts through the puller and screw them
into the hub a few turns, then tighten the center shaft with a 17mm open end
until the fan hub drops
off. wear goggles.
