Subject: Re: [T2] petrol smell in cab

&gt;Aren't these symptoms due to the no longer made filler neck tube being
&gt;worn/cracked ?  Laura

I had the very same problem with my '78. I had very, very poor rubber 
connections at the filler neck and the vent lines in the top of the engine 
compartment were broken. Repair was $35 or less.

When my filler neck fails this time I hope there will be a suitable 
replacement or I will have to fabricate a new one from metal.

Folks fix this ASAP because this is your second warning that your fuel 
system has failed and your bus is in danger of burning to the ground. (The 
first warning is the cracked and rotted rubber). Much cheaper to fix this 
than replace the bus. &lt;grin&gt;
