oh I do, I give thanks for this list,,,,and all you guys/gals and I give
thanks for AIRS and I give thanks for BustedBus, and Bus Depot and all the
other folks that try to help us keep our old beasts on the road and I do
give thanks that many years ago VW actually built a vehicle for the masses
and made it work.

so happy Thanksgiving to all weather your officially celebrating tommorrow
or do it at another time of year or not at all. THANKS to all of you.
