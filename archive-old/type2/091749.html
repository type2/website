Simple problem--simple solution--

Go to your automotive paint store---

Give them the year and the model of the vehicle---

They have the paint codes----you really don't need it--if you know what
vehicle you own--and a basic idea of what color it was---like red,
Brown, orange, blue, white---they have everything you need to know
there---

Later,

Terry

It must have been a *bad* day in Germany when they built my 78 Champagne
edition....probably built on Saturday or something. 
I have absolutely *NO* Mcode plate!!!! 
I have my bus almost ready for the painters this afternoon. 
Radio out, wiper motor out, plastic underdash fresh air vents out. I
cleaned the top of the air box from the passenger side door to the
steering column brace. Started looking at the other side and.... 
No mcode plate...holes for it are here.

What the h*ll do I do now???? I need the codes for the paint
colors for the painter. 
I *really* needed them for the interior color seats and panels as the
colors on my &quot;cloth&quot; inserts really don't seem to match what other
people have. I was hoping to catch a clue about the carpet color also. 
Anyone with a standard 78 Champagne edition with a copy of the mcode
plate? Someone had a pic of one that looked like mine, but I can't
remember who. 
Anyone? Help?? 
Cheers, dave
