Subject: Re: [T2] What IS this?

&gt;   I bought something on eBay, and I am not sure that I got what I thought I
got. Can anyone give me their opinions on this item, what it is, what year
it's for, or if it's even VW? I haven't opened the bag, but I cannot see any
indication that this part was made by VW or for a VW.

Vanagon Westies have a clear plastic roof vent in the center of the pop top.
Not sure when they started using them but I have seen it on an 85. It should be the seal that goes around the
clear vent.

That is my guess....
