Subject: RE: [T2]  Fiamma Rack

&gt; Anyone on the list have the Fiamma bike rack sold by
&gt; JustKampers?  How is it?


We also carry the Fiamma rack, so you don't have to order it from Europe. It
is sturdy and custom fit for the Bus.  It holds two bikes as shipped. You
can get a third rail that allows you to add a third bike.
