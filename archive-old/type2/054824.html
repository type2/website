Disconcerter_at_aol_dot_com sends:

&gt; ok folks, I got a bently, and found that I need molybdenum  grease on the
&gt; throw out bearing sleeve(also found out the sleeve means I have a later
&gt; tranny) But when I went to the flaps all I found was moly-graph, molybdenum
&gt; grease with graphite added. And ever since I found out about the whole GL-4
&gt; vs. GL-5 thing, I've been a little paranoid. will it be ok to use the
&gt; moly-graph in any aplication on our v-dubs calling for molybdenum?

It might even be better than the straight molybdenum. Graphite is just
carbon, it shouldn't hurt your car.
