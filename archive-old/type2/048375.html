&gt; Friends,

&gt; My bus and I are embarking on a journey from Austin, TX up to Minnesota in
&gt; ten days or so, and I have a few questions for you.
&gt;
&gt; 1. I need a place to sleep in Wichita, KS and in Sioux Falls, SD.

Hey.  I got a tip today from a college anthropology teacher.  I haven't tried it
yet, but i sure will next time I go on a trip.

    This guy says to call colleges and universities in the area you're planning
to stay, and see if they have empty dorms you can rent.  He said they usually
charge about ten bucks a night.  It's a pretty cool way to go, I think, and you
don't have to freeze in your bus.

    If you do end up staying in your bus, without getting into the coleman
death-heater issue, I would suggest buying a catalytic propane heater.  Just
read the directions, and crack a window.  I didn't die, and I did it for a
week.  It's really nice when it's chilly out.  I'm thinking about buying another
so I can run two when I'm driving.

    Good luck.

Plans to buy another bus are on hold, until next summer
when I will somehow have enough money to go to CA and buy one.
