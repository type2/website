Wow that had to be heavy! get any help? :)

&gt; I've been told by one vendor and a dealer that this 
&gt; item is no longer available, but I called a VW
&gt; junkyard this morning and was told that the drain
&gt; plugs are the same as the 1600's.

I'm not sure,but ron at bus depot has this part listed as available.
It has a different part no than the 1600 drain. I would give them (or
any of the other list vendors) a call &amp; find out for sure if this item
is still available. I would sure try &amp; hunt down the correct part from
a few more vendors than to give up quite yet. good luck.
