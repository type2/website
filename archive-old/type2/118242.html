Subject: Re: '71 Westy speaker location

Last week, several people offered tips on where to place speakers in 
a Westy.  Thought I'd pass along my own solution.

I had a pair of rather large speakers left over from an old personal 
stereo that no longer worked.

I bent two pieces of 1/32&quot; aluminum sheet into U-shaped brackets so 
that they hugged the rear seat back rest. I bolted each speaker to 
one of these. Wiring was easy and the sound is, well, awesome.
