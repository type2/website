Maybe it's just yours.  My local VWoA dealer, Burnsville Volkswagen, has 
always been most helpful in getting me anything for my '72 Westfalia that is 
still produced or not longer produced but still in an inventory in another 
Volkswagen dealer.  No laughs, no snickers just lots of help.  This was also 
with the 1987 Vanagon GL Syncro that I had.

&gt; Well, when I inherited my '78 Westy, I immediately went to the local VW 
&gt;  dealer (Houston) to get some replacement parts and was nearly laughed out 
of 
&gt; 
&gt;  there.  Not only did they not have any in stock, they were completely 
&gt;  uninterested in even trying to help me get any parts.
&gt;  
&gt;  Maybe just my local dealership, maybe not.
&gt;  
&gt;  I order thru Bus Depot or go down to BAP Geon to get local parts for my 
&gt;  Westy.  Both are always very helpful.
&gt;  
&gt;  Just my 2c worth.
