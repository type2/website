Subject: 40w Oil Report

Some of you may have read my post last week about my personal observations 
concerning the use of 20w50 oil in my 73 with 2.0 914 engine.  As I stated, 
I've just recently switched to straight 40w and have just completed a 900 mile 
trip that included running my engine WAY to hot for a large part of it.  The 
resulting oil pressures are virtually identical to what I was seeing before the 
trip.  Conclusion?  The straight 40w doesn't seem to suffer thermal breakdown 
like the 20w50 does.  I'll be running straight weight oil in both my aircooleds 
from now on.
