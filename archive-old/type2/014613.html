Hello everyone!

     My rear brakes, seems to be backing off. A month ago I adjusted my
rear brakes, and my parking brake, after adjusting my brake pedal was
nice and hard, now my parking brake comes way out again, and I have a
hard time stopping, this is how it was before adjusting them, I can tell
my front brakes are doing all the stopping. so whats up with these
brakes? I replaced the shoes about a year and a half ago, I also flushed
and bleed the brake fluid. I'm going to adjust the brakes again
hopefully this weekend.

    I just received new 1600cc heads from Bus depot, and was wondering
what the best way to store them is? I don't want the valves to rust or
anything. I'll store them until a future project. And Thanks Bus Depot
for great service.

     I just bought a timing light from sears, but it did not come in a
case to protect it, so I bought a hand gun carrying case, with the egg
foam in it, to store it in and to protect it. It only cost $8.99. 

    Sorry for the long post, but I had allot to say.

     Hope everyone has a safe and happy holiday!

Thanks,
Shawn Reed
