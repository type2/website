Subject: Re: [T2] Rust

Joshua,

The archives have tons of messages about the wonderous powers of POR-15 (and
I agree) but someone mentioned here that plain ol' grease smeared on will
stop rust at least for awhile.  It doesn't get any cheaper.  8^)

&gt; Let's consider this:
&gt; assuming I have rust, albeit minimal and largely cosmetic (slight wheel
well
&gt; edge, back left where a collision occurred, floor below the driver and
&gt; passenger seats, scattered etceteras) (which I do), and assuming I do not
care
&gt; for it, and care for it to eat my bus to death (which I don't) how might
one
&gt; prevent further corrosion, say stop the rust where it is until the budget
can
&gt; handle a complete overall, full body work and paint? Mind you, the
Southwest
&gt; is very dry, but this bus (71) did manage to get a speck here and there
&gt; (largest area 10 x 10 inches), despite being in New Mexico since 1971.
