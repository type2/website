Subject: R: [T2] wattage use of a laptop (was Auxiliary batteries)

Laptops draw as much as 90 watts when switched on, specially the more recent
ones.

This is not a problem for our busses though, I regularly use my laptop for
music and it's attached to a &quot;12v-to-19v&quot; transformer; it is quite cheap and
wastes less energy than a system &quot;12v-to-220v-to-19v&quot;.

Anyway, if you left the laptop charging only, not switched on, I do not
expect it to draw more than 20w; it all depends on your computer
transformer.

Andy
