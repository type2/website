All the expensive sockets aside, in an emergency, a 24&quot; pipe wrench and
a 6 foot cheater bar usually work fine! I have removed many a stubborn
36mm and 46mm castellated axle nut fron VW's, bugs as well as Vans, and
didn't even wreck the nut! I have however, broken a 46mm socket on a
particularly rusted rear axle, one of those China specials!  have a
Craftsman 3/4&quot; brakes bar and a SnapOn t-handle($5.00 at a flea mkt!,
100 bux + from the dealer!)and can't seem to hurt either one.

My .021/2.

Chris.
