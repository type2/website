Subject: RE: [T2] Rust Under the Windshield

Please Ron--

Give me the names, phone number's and the location's of the professional
body shops / restoration facilities that use this gruel--

I want to talk to them--

Garbage--

The rest of the info you drew out here was on the money--

All except this (non) miracle in a can.

Professionally Your's,

TK

&quot;I'd also recommend that you use POR-15&quot;

&quot; This one works, and is commonly used by professional restorers.&quot;
