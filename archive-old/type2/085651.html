Subject: Penetrol and MCM sound deadening

 
--David,

thanks for the review, I'm planning this myself, and my head's spinning about all the different products/prices. I guess the truth will be told when you put your bus on the road and listen.

Mr. Bulley makes some pretty serious claims about q-pad and quietude, which almost makes me want to pony up the extra $2/sqft. But your testimony may sway my opionion.

I'd like to hear more as you progress. I've been filling the non-water draining cavities with the &quot;great stuff&quot; foam lately. I would recommend to apply in the shade, as heat makes it run. Filled my rear hatch, tailgate, and lower portions of the quarter panel inside above the rear wheelwell.

Again, we'll see what happens.

Billy

&gt;I recently tried out two products mentioned on this list.
&gt;
&gt;The first was Penetrol, which I found at Home Depot as advertised.  &gt;The second was sound deadening material from MCM Electronics
