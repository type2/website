Ronnie and all...

I had one in the mail when I got home from the OCTO show.
It had Sweinhagen's red BD on the front of it.

&gt;     I had heard  that one was supposed to go out a few weeks ago (the
classic news letter), I won't hold my breath. A
&gt; couple people are working there ass's off to save NEATO but that's it in
my opinion. They tried to save it, it got decent
&gt; for a while and is back on the track of SOTO. I heard the news letter
editor passed it on and someone else has picked
&gt; it up, he's a good guy and I hope he can get it going and back on track. I
have gotten a couple NEATO short e-mail
&gt; news letters in the last 6 months, but haven't seen a news letter in 2004,
paid in full 3 times in 2 years.
&gt;    At least they could send a letter to the members to let them know they
still exist and are working on getting it back
&gt; together again. 400 members X's 38 cents for a stamp, 15 minutes to type a
letter, go to kinkos have it copied, folded
&gt; and stapled, print out the mailing labels and everyone is happy, some news
is better then no news
