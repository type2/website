Subject: RE: [T2] How do I mount this thing??? - I'm done.

Jason, 

Mine was mounted on the front when I got it.  Sure, in a low-speed front end collision it might cause more damage if you hit something high enough.  But I would want that extra bit of padding in a higher-speed collision.  After all, there ain't much between you and the front bumper.  Less than most any other vehicle.  I doubt it affects the aerodynamics noticeably.  (Wow, aerodynamics and bus in the same sentence!)  Plus I think it looks cool. I did get my tire cover from BD.    Just wait 'til you see mine with a saxophone painted on it!  I'm working on it. And trust me, Ron is good to his word.  Sometimes he just gets swamped as in any small business.   

Still saving for Koni's....KR
