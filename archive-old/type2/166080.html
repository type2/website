Subject: RELIABLE kit source for conversion of '71 to LPG?

Hi there. I've been away from the list for quite some time. But I'm back 
now, and after searching the archives and to hell and back on the www, I 
have a question.

Does anyone know of a _reliable_, tested source for LPG conversion kits 
for a 1971 camper? I'd like to get everything I need, perhaps minus the 
tank/s (shipping ouchy), in a kit rather than cobbling something together.

Any helpful information will be greatly appreciated. Any snide remarks 
about converting my bus to LPG will be cheerfully ignored. ;-)

Many thanks,

tank
