&gt; this one is certainly the most attractive, but I'm not happy with the
&gt; engineering aspects of the installation.  It does nothing to prevent
&gt; recirculation, which is the usual cause of overheating.  I think that the
&gt; spare tire arrangement would work fine in motion, but would have problems
&gt; when moving slowly or stopped.  I note that he used an extremely efficient
&gt; (and expensive) custom radiator, so he might have enough excess capacity
&gt; there to overcome recirculation problems.

Oh, he has excess capacity coming out the a**. There's an electric fan on
it. There's also a secondary radiator under the car with a fan on it.

What would work fairly well on an inline 4 is an adaptation of the VW
Quantum's radiator setup. That engine is so long a radiator in its normal
position won't fit in the car, so they've set the engine off to the side
(one halfshaft is longer than the other) and put the radiator next to the
engine.

Hobart Kennedy does say that purging the air out of your coolant lines is
the hardest part of a front-mounted radiator setup. You'd be stuck with this
problem even in a watercooled Vanagon conversion.
