Subject: Upper Trailing Arm Removal - Replacement
In-Reply-To: &lt;44.aa19b5c.279c36cd_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Volks,

I was consulting with another list member about removing/replacing the
trailing arms on his bus.  Two points came up that may not be apparent
immediately when you start in on the job.

1. It is all but imposible to remove the upper trailing arms if you have
not removed the bump-stops from the horns of the beam.  These bump stops
are held on to the horns by a post and clip arrangement.  To remove them,
look inside the horn and you will see a clip much like the ones that hold
the rubber brake hoses in place.  Wet that clip with penetrating oil and
rap it with a hammer and punch untill you free it up.  Lif the trailing
arm off the bump stop with a pry bar and rap the base plate of the bump
stop to free it up as well.  Then reach in there with a needle nosed vise
grip and remove the clip.  Pry the arm back up and remove the bump stop.  

The upper arm is *still* a bear to get off, even with the bump stop gone,
but it is at least *possible*.  A bit of grease on the horn to ease the
sliding of the arm is also a good idea.

2. Once you have the steering knuckle off the upper trailing arm,, you
will note that the diameter of the stud for the upper ball joint looks
much larger than the stud on the new ball joint... this is because there
is an eccentric bushing on that stud (it *usually* come off with the
arm... if you don't see it, look in the steering knuckle)  As much as it
looks like it is part of the ball joint stud casting, it is a separate
piece!  Remove it with a puller, heat, a heavy hammer, whatever (you are
not looking to save the old ball joints, which makes brute force a bit
more acceptable here :-)  Save the bushing, obviously, and do your best
not to mar the outer cone surface.  The hex flats on the upper part of the
bushing *are* part of the bushing, they are not a separate lock nut.  
That groove between the bushing and the flats is just a groove, not a
separation.

and lastly, Heloise sez: if you mark the orientation of the
bushing on the steering knuckle and the bushing, it will make the trip to
the alignment shop a lot less exciting.  You *still* need a front end
alignment, honest, but having the wheel *way* out of alignment can make
steering more fun than you can safely stand.

OK?  any questions?
