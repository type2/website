Subject: old windshield washers

I filled pressurized my windshield squirters.

When I hit the button, it sprayed beautifully, but
wouldn't stop--the button on the windshield wiper
switch would not pop out. Finally all the water and
pressure peed out.

If i can't find a reasonbly priced replacement, i
might try some other kind of valve.
Ergo, can anyone explain briefly how the valve works?

If all else fails i'll put in an electric pump I've
got around here somewhere.
