Subject: Re: [T2] Heat exchangers and tin

Hi Kate,

Do you have a Bentley manual? If you will look at the exhaust diagram (page
12, Engine &amp; Clutch in mine) you will see something like 1-inch wide clamp
that connects the smaller muffler heat exchanger to the large separate heat
exchanger. If you purchased a muffler installation kit, two probably came
with it.

Separately, this is part number 113-255-341A  (heater box to muffler clamp).
Bus Depot lists them at $1.25 each.

Unfortunately you may have to remove either the heat exchanger or the
muffler to get the clamp to slide into place on the tubes. Once in place you
will find you will be able to bridge the space between the tubes with the
clamp. Tighten it has hard as possible with a screwdriver to secure it.

It will not affect the mechanical running of your bus but it will keep air
that should be blowing through the heat exchangers and into your bus on cold
days from escaping.

Cheers,

John Rogers

&gt; I bought a set of the nice, heavy dansk ones from busdepot a few years
back. Wasn't able to install them at the time. When I did finally get around
to it, I wasn't able to get them to connect with... uhm... the part of the
muffler that moves back and forth on the little tubes.... &lt;grin&gt; I know,
that's terribly helpful, isn't it? Anyway, I don't want to beat up my heat
exchangers, but I'd like them to fit together. I suspect the bus still won't
run right, but I'd feel better about it. Any suggestions?
