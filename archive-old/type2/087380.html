Subject: Re: [T2] Message to VWoA &amp; MVVC

&gt;For anyone else who may not know, In a nutshell, Volkswagen of 
&gt;America is coming down very hard on
&gt;many small businesses and web sites that promote products for VW's. 
&gt;Any company that has the word
&gt;&quot;bug&quot; or &quot;bus&quot; in their name is in danger of a lawsuit from VWoA.

Sounds to me like the infamous &quot;kitty litter letter&quot; that many 
journalists get. Use the words &quot;kitty&quot; and &quot;litter&quot; together in a 
national publication and you get a letter from Ralston Purina (or 
whichever corporation currently owns the trademark for Kitty Litter.) 
I've never heard of any actual legal action. It's just something a 
company has to do to protect a trademark in this Byzantine era of 
intellectual property laws.

  I'm guessing the most appropriate action to a VWoA threat is to say 
&quot;ha! Ha! Ha! I got the kitty litter letter.&quot; But I'd make sure I 
opened any subsequent certified mail.

Sorry if I'm beating a dead horse to death  here.
