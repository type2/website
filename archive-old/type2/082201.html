&lt;&lt; nope..the back hatch is not 4' wide, to the best of my knowledge....I tried

Unless mine has middle age &quot;spread&quot;, it's 48 1/2&quot;...I think that's a bit
higher through the hatch than the spacing at the deck height. A mov-

the widest part of the opening...
Again, I'd recommend a local lumberyard while you still have a choice.
