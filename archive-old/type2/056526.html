Subject: Hold the Mayo:  PART II

Thanks to Joel Walker for his directing me towards
Bardahl Oil Treatment as a quick fix for my sticky
hydraulic lifters.

Of course, as the story unfolded, I could not find
Bardahl, but I hit upon GUNK as a quick and cheap
alternative.

I am still absolutely happy with the product.
After I changed my oil, and found that the
mayonnaise was gone, I took a trip to Trak Auto
during my lunch hour yesterday to copy down all
the particulars from the GUNK ValveMedic yellow
plastic bottle.  In fact, I included the specifics
for the two ingredients (Aliphatic Petroleum
Distillate &amp; Naphtenic Petroleum Oil Mixture).  I
was fishing.  I was expecting that many of the
chemical engineers out there would come back with
some esoteric (Heck, I have 'spell check' on this
new Navigator/Communicator browser,  I can use
words like that, now.) explanation of the
properties of these two compounds, and why they
did whatever they did.

Nothing.  Only two responses.  Everybody sleeping
out there?!?!?

Well, I went out on the net with my FAVORITE
SEARCH ENGINE -

     http://infind.inference_dot_com/infind/infind.exe

an put in      aliphatic    ----  Nothing
interesting.

Then I put in    68476    (from the code
68476-34-6 for Aliphatic Petroleum Distillate) and
I got a bunch of hits.  Well, look at this one!!

Is ANYONE surprised?!!?

PLEASE bookmark that search engine.  It is the
best thing since sliced bread (hold the mayo!!)
