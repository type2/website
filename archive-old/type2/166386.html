Subject: RE: [T2] 1971 Type 2 Engine Recommendations

The consensus seems to be that, given my time, finances and resources, I
should probably go with a longblock in my 1971 westy.  The vendors that
seem to be rising to the surface appears to be Mofoco and Old Volks
Home.  Unfortunately, Old Volks doesn't seem to sell parts any more.

Here is my delimma.

Mofoco has the following ...
=&quot;0 miles&quot; dual port 1600 _at_ $1399
=(87 Bore) 1641 _at_ $1559
=(90.5 Bore) 1776 _at_ $1599
=(92 Bore) 1835 _at_ $1599
=(94 Bore) 1914 _at_ $1599

Logically? It seems I would want the most &quot;bang for the buck&quot; and there
isn't much of a price difference between the new 1600 and the 1914.
(Especially pushing a Westy down the road)  However, I am stuck asking
myself what problems (and additional costs) might I experience if I
&quot;upgrade&quot;.  Can I use the same stock carb, intake, distributor, exaust,
etc...?  Will I have overheating problems?

Suggestions...Comments...

Thanks,

Michael
