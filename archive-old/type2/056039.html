Sounds like you have a problem with the booster or the oneway valve in the
line to the booster.  Take out the oneway valve and check it - it's a small
plastic piece just in front of the engine (in front of the tin).  Air
should pass through one way (towards the engine) and not the other way
(towards the booster).
