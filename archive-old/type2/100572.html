Subject: Re: [T2] so, if I am testing for shorts, what am I doing wrong?

--Does that make sense Chris?

Won't the bulb in series just draw whatever it requires to light itself (load) no matter what the short is doing? It's a simple circuit. (12vdc+/short/bulb/12vdc-)

Billy

&gt;I would suggest using a dome light bulb in series with the battery &gt;to see if it is a large load (bright light) b/c most of the $20 &gt;multimeters would let the smoke out if subjected to a 5 AMP load in &gt;the current meter setting.

&gt;If the bulb is bright, big load, if the bulb doesn't light or is &gt;very dim you might be okay testing it with the meter.
