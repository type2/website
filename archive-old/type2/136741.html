The Click and Clack software plays on stereotypes. if you are gay you drive these vehicles, if you are female you drive these vehicles, etc. &lt;griN!&gt; 

I used to find them entertaining but their &quot;misinformation&quot; has been numerous enough that I have lumped them in with &quot;VW trends&quot; and &quot;Hot VWs&quot;. Misinformation for the newbies... 

I've seen that Dwelle show many times. REALLY great! Interesting cars sometimes too (thinking VW Eurovan with Porsche 911 engine stuffed in the backend for one...). You can watch the channel live online for free.

I watch it during my lunch break sometimes.
