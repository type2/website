&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a Craftsman Professional wire-feed welder that is running
&gt; &gt; flux-core
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; gas just works so much better
&gt;
&gt; I have a hose I can hook up for gas, but it is another thing I am very
&gt; unfamiliar with.

it is actually easier to learn

&gt; No idea. It seems just like a very sturdy steel frame. Grinds pretty well.

sounds like regular steel..

&gt; &gt; Duroc suggested slowing down the wire speed - which I did, but then I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; hard time maintaining an arc, and the results are the same.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; turn up the amps, the other switch on most welders....
&gt;
&gt; Amps are up as high as they will go (Duroc's suggestion - up the juice)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; well the big mistake I was making was trying to move too fast,  stay in
&gt; &gt; one spot longer, until the metal puddles
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I guess I could spend a little more time in a spot and let the metal heat up
&gt; more. Just gotta maintain that arc I hear.

yeah gotta maintain the arc, one other problem that can affect these
smaller welders is the power supply, gotta have the full rated power
needed avaliable.
