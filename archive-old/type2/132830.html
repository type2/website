&gt; Tranny, it makes this cool sounding howling sound, I know it's bad but
&gt; what exactly causes this. It has NOT popped out of gear and feels pretty

Checked the oil level lately? If you find it low then drain what's in
there, refill, drive a couple hundred miles, drain, and fill again (maybe
do that twice -- drain fill after some miles). You're going to have metal
shavings in there if it ran low, the idea is to try to flush them out.

If it's low enough to require the above you should also plan for a
rebuild/replacement within the next 12 - 18 months.

I think there are a couple of other possibilities that cause howling but
others will have to chime in. 

And, like the &quot;growling&quot; from another post it could be CV's on the way out.
CV's create all kinds of unusual noises that are darn hard to pinpoint. If
they're getting sloppy they could be setting up a resonant vibration when
you are at cruising speed in 4th.
