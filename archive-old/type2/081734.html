&gt; lets be realistic your gonna do what every one else on the list has done
&gt; ME INCLUDED!!
&gt;
&gt; I  got my bus while I was still collage, (1998)
&gt;  and when ever I would go &quot;home&quot; (about 200 miles)
&gt; I'd run it wide open, (usually runnin the &quot;front door&quot;
&gt; for some trucker trying to make time)
&gt; &quot;DA-BUS&quot; was/still is a stock '78,
&gt; the previous owner had removed the fuel injection,
&gt; replacing it with a Weber &quot;dune buggy carb&quot;
&gt; lost the CAT, and put a &quot;MOZNA BIG BORE&quot; muffler on,
&gt; he was an idiot but that's another story, any way
&gt; 70 MPH or higher was my rule of thumb on good old I-75.
&gt; and I was haven a blast, running joke with the boys,  was if
&gt; we did a road trip in DA-BUS I'd cover gas but every one
&gt; would have to pichen in for the case or two of oil I'd go through.
&gt;
&gt; then on one fateful day (visiting mom in Cinny) I went to back on
&gt; to my &quot;work&quot; ramps so I could do ________ I forget exactly what now
&gt; and &quot;pop&quot; yah that quiet so I figured hay the bus is still running I can
&gt; make
&gt; it bake to Toledo (200 mi) well we, DA-BUS &amp; I, made it about 170mi
&gt; on our own _at_ 55 -60 mph. that's when she started smoken......
&gt; I was young and stupid, so I said she'll make the last 30 mi. if I just
keep
&gt; it
&gt; at 45-50.
&gt;
&gt; well we all learn at some point.. she made it another 17 mi. before
&gt; she dumped the oil, and I called the tow truck to get us home.
&gt;
&gt; She sat for a year, (remember I was still in collage no $), and when
&gt; my (then girl friend now wife)'s car started to die (like all water
coolers
&gt; do)
&gt; we did the math  and  went for parts...
&gt; I spent the next month learning how to take apart and rebuild a T2 engine
&gt;
&gt; Two months latter we drove (Toledo, Ohio to Boston, MA) to my best friends
&gt; wedding, That's when I turned in to my Mom, we drove 55 the whole way,
&gt; and it now takes me 4.5 hours to get to Canny from Toledo, but I do it for
&gt; the
&gt; love of the Bussen life!
&gt;
&gt; basically I said all that to say this,
&gt; you  cant really appreciate the &quot;COST&quot; of hot roding in your bus until
&gt; you spend a few nights under around and over your engine dismantling it
and
&gt; rebuilding it because the valve you dropped  smoked the head and destroyed
&gt; the piston.
&gt; then and only then do understand the damage that is caused by somthing the
&gt; sise of a baby spoon.
&gt;
&gt; in closing my davice is this. if you must roll at 65-80 MPH, go ahead,
&gt; do it, have fun, and enjoy your self, but have an extra $1,000.00 in the
&gt; bank
&gt; to pay for membership in to the  &quot;ben there done that club&quot; that all long
&gt; term Bus
&gt; oweners belong to.
&gt;
&gt; good luck!
&gt;
&gt; Mike and Adrienne LaBarge
&gt;
&gt; and of course:
&gt;                         DA-BUS
