Travis,

     Without the exacting details, what part of Portland are you from?  I am

&gt; Lukas --
&gt; My girlfriend had a similar problem with her 77 bus.  After a long drive
to
&gt; Seattle and back, just as she rounded the corner for home, she began to
get
&gt; some grinding/whirring noises from the middle to back of the bus.  Once
she
&gt; got it home (fortunately she was close by) I went out to attempt a
&gt; diagnosis.  With the engine running and me working the clutch and shifter
&gt; (but not moving the bus), I found that there was much difficulty engaging
&gt; all gears; really had to push it in as the noises accompanied.  I then
&gt; found that when I would let out the clutch and try to move the bus, it
&gt; wouldn't move at all; the shifter felt like it was going into gear, but I
&gt; was obviously mistaken.  After a while of doing this, things went from bad
&gt; to worse in a hurry: the thing finally went into 1st and wouldn't come
back
&gt; out again -- not even with both hands.  Dead in the water.  I looked in
the
&gt; engine compartment and there appeared to be fluid or gear oil splattered
&gt; all over the inner walls.  Anyway, to make a long story short, she was the
&gt; &quot;proud&quot; owner of a &quot;new&quot; rebuilt transmission about a week later after a
&gt; respected mechanic's inspection.  Clutch and all else was fine.  Sorry to
&gt; be a downer, but your symptoms sounded similar to ours.  You may want to
&gt; get the tranny looked at.
