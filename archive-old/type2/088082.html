Subject: Re: Even More FI Rich/Lean Questions

Chuck,

Yes, you have correctly stated the purpose of the fuel pressure regulator.
It keeps the difference in pressure constant between the fuel and the intake
air. This keeps the &quot;flow per second&quot; constant out of the injector.
Theoretically if the pressure regulator overcompensated in this fashion it
could provide enrichment based on engine load - but to my understanding this
is not the purpose.

&gt;Why does the L-Jetronic fuel pressure regulator in my bus sample the air
&gt;input manifold pressure?
&gt;
&gt;If the vacuum line to the regulator is removed and blocked would the engine
&gt;run richer? Would the vacuum drop.
&gt;
&gt;Is the differential pressure at the injector tip the signed sum of the air
&gt;manifold pressure and the fuel manifold pressure?
&gt;
&gt;Is the differential pressure at the injector tip held constant by the fuel
&gt;pressure regulator control loop?
&gt;
&gt;If the differential pressure is held constant would fuel delivery per
&gt;injection pulse be affected by changes in manifold pressure?
&gt;
&gt;Is the function of the fuel pressure control loop to control the
&gt;differential pressure at the injector tip?
