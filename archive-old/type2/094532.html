I agree here, let's also consider the pollution involved in the production of new cars, multiplied by a two year lease times 50 years of driving life. Plastic, upholstry, etc etc.

Heard on KPFA the other day that if the Chinese ran cars like we do, we'd be on a dead planet already.

My bus may pollute a little more than a newer car, but I also walk a lot, ride the bike, keep the bus (with catalytic) in tune, stay out of the consumer-industrial purchasing trap, and most importantly, teach it to my kids.

Up late, broke bus.
