Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Hurricane Wilma 

I didn't mention my bus is a 73 camper. I have also
looked into the ragtop alternative. The only reason I
would like to keep the fiberglass top is to maintain
the bus' original style. 

The only place I found a ragtop was on the following
website:

http://store.streetbeatcustoms_dot_com/slidragtopvw-c.html

If I can get a complete camper top for the same price
or less, I may stick to the camper option.

&gt; He also really wants to have the massive moon

&gt; it into a Weekender with a rag top is really looking
&gt; like a good option for him.
&gt; 
&gt; If someone WAS to actually have a Westfalia and
&gt; wanted to install the large moonroof hardware on it,
&gt; where would you get it from and how difficult is it
&gt; to install? Does it require any modifications to the
&gt; body? or does it simply all bolt in?
