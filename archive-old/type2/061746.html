Subject: Re: re buses by blue ridge question

&gt;i think its very sad that noone answered my question but 2 list members took
&gt;the time to write and inform me i had committed a mortal sin for typeing in
&gt;ALL CAPS....

What if they expected sentences to begin with capital letters and end with
periods? What a savage world it would be around here then. =^ )

I heard a rumor that they aren't going to do Buses on the Blue Ridge
anymore because it has just gotten out of hand.

Some of us were talking about an annual event at Fall Creek Falls,
Tennessee in addition to/place of it.
