Subject: RE: [T2] bus tail pipes...IGNORE THREAD!

Oops sorry, I'm sending the beetle one back and getting a crisp german 
exahust. Whooohoo.


&gt;I got sent a beetle muffler by mistake and am wondering if the bus tail 
&gt;pipes (the ones that shoot the exaust to the side) can be put on this 
&gt;muffler?
