Subject: 1700 Engine/Parts Wanted

Hey Folks,
   I know it's a long shot, but anyone out there got a complete 1700 engine
and/or parts they are looking to sell? Specifically looking for
pistons/cylinders, heads, etc. don't really need any other stuff. It would be
great if someone heading to Everybus had this stuff, as I'll be there. Could
perhaps even use an 1800. Thanks,  Jeff
