Subject: Re: [T2] Bentley on Automatics

Richard,

I also have a 77 Westy Automatic, and just changed the gasket and screen.
They come together in a kit, and are pretty cheap.

You can tell the difference in the gaskets when you go to the FLAPS because
there are a different amount of bolts in the 2 different models. The picture
in the Bentley is for the early model. Count your bolts on the pan and then
check the gasket against that when you go the the FLAPS to make sure they
give you the right one before you remove the fluid and pan. Also I didn't
find a &quot;drain&quot; plug on mine....we had to loosen the bolts and let the fluid
collect and drain at one corner...this will make a mess!! So be prepared
with a large container to catch the old fluid.

Good luck!
