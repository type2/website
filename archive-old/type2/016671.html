I am contemplating the stock dual carb preheated air intake, in which
there is a elbow macaroni shaped piece of tin that draws warm air from
below the #1 cylinder and connects to the top front tin on the right
side of the engine compartment.  My question is: What goes between the
squarish whole where the air enters the engine compartment and the round
hose which draws the air into the air cleaner?  Would someone please
describe this piece to me so I can know what I'm looking for in my piles
of junk?  Thanks much.
