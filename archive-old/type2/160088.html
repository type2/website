Subject: Re: Dog house oil cooler &amp; pedestal questions

hmm... I also have an external oil filter and external cooler from another
motor...

Where is the best place to mount the external oil cooler?

I suspect this will be the better way overall to go, plus! I have the
hardware for this.

Wish I thought of it before I spent too  much money on the internal cooler.

&gt; I'm building a franken motor for my '70 bus out of a bunch of 1600cc.
&gt;
&gt; I purchased a doghouse oil cooler &amp; pedestal in hopes of converting
&gt; everything to dual port.
&gt; Only problem is that they did not come with hardware.
&gt; What do I need to install this?
&gt; And now that I am looking at it, I am confused as to how to mount it.
&gt; Help! hehe
