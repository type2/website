Re solid cot poles not fitting 74- later Westies:
I think the early (71 bus-68 bus) Westies had the solid painted shorter
poles.  The later ones had the adjustable stamped/bent flat steel
galvanized &quot;poles&quot;.  I probably have these somewhere in my morass of a
garage, since back in '94 I made a much better front sleeping area for
my child, consisting of 3 1/1&quot; oak poles designed to sling from over the
front dash to loops hung from the seatbelt mounts.  A board made from
thin ply went over this  (cut to match curve of windshield in front and
reaching to seat on other side) and it was all held in alignment by pins
made from nails that dropped thru holes in the board and thru the
poles.  It sat right over the steering wheel and allowed the doors to be
opened.  I stored it above the top folding bed and placed the poles in
the slot over the rear cloths closet. (78 Westy) A foam mat went over
this.  Holds much more weight than the 40 lbs the cot claims  (110 lbs
no problem; my daughter used it until age 11!  Then I designed another
board bed that spans lengthwise between rear bed and up to front dash,
but that's another story.
