Subject: Re: [T2] Uh-oh ... what have I got here?

&gt;Well, Chris, the update is: I retorqued the head and adjusted the valves on
&gt;the left side and ran another compression check. I got a perfect 135 psi on
&gt;#3 but nothing on #4. I guess the culprit was the valves were too tight and
&gt;I got burned. I'll open her up in a week or to and see what I've got, but
&gt;assuming it's an exhaust valve what is your experience? Grind and replace
&gt;the valve or spring for a new head?

Readjust the valves on the heads that got retorqued. They may be too tight 
and holding the valve open.

If anyone adjusted the valves while the head was loose, they would be too 
tight once the heads were torqued.

don't forget to torque the other head too.

Did you JUST torque the nuts under the valve cover or did you torque ALL of 
the head bolts (the ones under the cylinder tin).

I would torque ALL of them so that you did not pull the ones you just 
torqued after a few heat cycles (it's possible, not for sure). They will be 
doing their job + the work the top row (under the tin) is supposed to be 
doing too.
