Subject: Re: [Q] Restoring Daily Driver

The time frame you mentioned is absolutely impossible.  Maybe the pimp my ride
crew could do it in a week.  I think a rolling restoration is possible and can
lead to good results.  For more involved jobs like removing window glass, you
will need to take it off the road for awhile.  Do whatever you can to take
time pressure off yourself.  Good luck.
