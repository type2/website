Subject: Re: [T2] Transmission drain plug with '80s hairdo

Thanks for your replies thus far.

Don, no it didn't make any unusual noises nor was it difficult to  
shift.  After the oil change it is still shifting fine and making no  
untoward noises that I can hear.

I am going to do exactly as the list has recommended and change the  
oil again in a few months.  I suspect the magnet will be fairly  
clean, but that's really just a guess.

If all else fails, there's always the spare trans from the parts bus!

Thanks again,
Zack

Change the fluid, drive a thousand miles or so, then change it again
and see what comes out.
