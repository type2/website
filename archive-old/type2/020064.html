Subject: Fuel gauge wire

I seem to be missing the fuel gauge wire in the 69 -- the one that runs
from the tank to the gauge. The schematic shows it as a brown (ground)
wire. The compartment for the gas tank has, in the upper right front, a
welded-on large washer and threaded nut that accesses under the back
seat. Does that missing wire route through there? And where does it go
to get to the fuel gauge? Inside the walls? Along the edge of the roof?
Or somewhere else entirely?
