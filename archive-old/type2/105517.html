Subject: Re: FW: [T2] More F.I. questions and pictures. Any ideas?
  Thanks  for the help!!!!

Hello Richard,

Hmmm... This is making me think. My bus is a 74. If I
remember correctly, my back up lights worked the last
time I actually had the tail lights installed. I will
go over the differences in the wiring for 74 back up
lighting vs. the late model bus back up lighting. This
is an example of one of the bugs that has to be worked
out when putting a late model bus F.I. in an earlier
bus. No big deal. :)

Thanks for the info. Now that I know what those wires
are for I can see if they are acutually needed or not.
Thanks again for all of your help!!!! 

Thanks guys!!!

Regards,

David Kelly

&gt; If Karl is right then the wires you found must
&gt; couple somewhere partway
&gt; under the body.
&gt; 
&gt; I believe it is up front in the shifter.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I believe that the wire you are referring to
&gt; powers the backup lights.
&gt; &gt; &gt; If it has 12 volts on it then this is almost
&gt; certainly where it goes.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Took me a long time to figure that one out
&gt; myself. The bus did not have
&gt; &gt; &gt; working backup lights when I got it, and it took
&gt; some time studying the
&gt; &gt; &gt; wiring diagram to figure out that the power for
&gt; them came from the coil.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Check your light assembly on the drivers side of
&gt; the bus for a hot
&gt; &gt; &gt; connection for the backup lights.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So where is the backup up switch for the automatic
&gt; transmission? It doesn't
&gt; &gt; appear to be on the nosecone like the manual.
