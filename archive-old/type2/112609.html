Subject: Distributor drive gear shims

Finally got my dizzy drive gear out of my 69, after dealing with the broken 
fuel pump base that was down in the case and had to be fished out. I'm trying 
to figure out why the PO had wallered out the old dizzy clamp to make the old 
dizzy slide in further to accomodate a lack of height in the drive gear. After 
pulling drive gear I discovered it had the two shims that a stock engine is 
supposed to have but this is a replacement case and a note in Bentley says that 
on some of these replacement cases the seat for the drive gear was machined a 
little deeper and required a 3mm thick shim under the two standard shims. Does 
anybody have a part# for this 3mm shim or could I just use extra standard shims 
to bring up to the height where it mates up with the dizzy? The only thing I 
don't quite get with this is that with the distributor clamp removed the 
distributor mated up but the clamp is only about 3-4 mm thick itself, so that 
tells me that the the distributor doesn't mate up completely anyway because the 
male and female ends are longer/deeper than 3mm. Somebody put me in check if 
I'm completely off base.
