Subject: Hi!

Hi to all!
I am new in the list and this is my first posting. I
own a 1969 transporter in good condition. Has a new
1600 SP engine. This one is my 6th Bus. I am looking
for a conversion to use a golf 2L engine. I know lots
of people oppose to this kind of modifications but
after restoring 3 from the ground up from Vintage to
mildly modified(including Campers); I will like to
have some thing different to play around. I have seen
the conversion to put a rotary 12a or 13b engine, a
1.8 Toyota engine and a Golf. Like most of you I am a
VW nuts and I would like to stay with VW brand engine.
I saw the modification been sold for Vanagons few
months back in VW Trends or Hot VW's from a company
base in Ca., but at the moment I can't find the
source. So if anyone knows where to get that
modification or have any information, comments please
let me know. Or if any one knows some body that have
done some thing similar fell free to write me.
Thanks!:)

Keep Busing!!!!
