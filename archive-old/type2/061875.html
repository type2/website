Anyone have a VW reference that lists displacement by motor numbers?? I
need to know what size the following are;

CB104218    1.7L or 1.8L???
EA067548 (from a  411 or412???) 1.7L or 1.8L??

CB is a dual carb 1.7 from a 72-73 bus..the 73 would have the smog pump (or
the remains of it's mounts anywhere from 63-68 hp, depending on who you
believe
 EA 1.7 FI engine from a 72-411 or 73 412 *automatic* (remember to put the
pilot bearing in the end of the crank for bus use) should be 78 hp with the
FI...
CB in my 72 bus developed 37 hp at the wheels, the EA in the same bus, had 49
and the W series 1.7 FI,  66 hp!
These are uncorrected HP figures on the same Clayton water brake, during the
course of several months..but you get the idea I never put the carbs on an EA
but drove one..seemed &quot;stronger in the mid range...but, thats kinda
subjective,no?
Stop wishing for a 1.8..they were less powerful, with smaller valves and
all....
I'd go with the better of the two...remember, that CB has pushed a bus over
many a hill...the EA was hooked to a nice soft automatic....in a car....
