Subject: Re: [T2] 70 turn signal switch wanted??

Hiya Craig,

Yep, that turn signal switch can be a bit of a problem on a 70.  When I had 
to replace the turn signal switch on the Duck a couple of years ago, I was 
unable to find a new one for replacement.  Well, truth be told, I did find one 
that was selling for $139.  That was a tad steep for me.  So, I settled in to 
Plan B.

I went to swaps and shows and whenever I found a turn signal switch from a 70 
(and they are out there surprisingly enough) I grabbed it.  Most cost way 
less than $10.  I usually laid out around $5.  Then, with all my switches (I 
rounded up 6 of 'em) I sat down to build one good switch out of the parts I had.  
Worked great for me and my total out-of-pocket was less than $40.  And, I 
might add, the switch is still in there and doing a great job.

I do have a bunch of switch parts if you need any.
