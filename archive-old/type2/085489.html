George Lyle sends:

&gt; I've seen a couple of conversions where the radiator is located in the
&gt; left engine bay, drawing air from the left air intake and exhausting it
&gt; through the gaps around the engine (no more engine bay seal)  I've also
&gt; seen a conversion done with the radiator replacing the engine bay door,
&gt; but that one had cooling problems, probably due to lack of shrouding
&gt; around the radiator to prevent recirculation.


This is THE primo radiator shroud...

Roadcow's radiator is on the roof toward the back--he field-modified the
luggage rack section on a Westfalia poptop to hold the radiator.
