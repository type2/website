Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator cooling boot

Very bizarre indeed....

Since reproing this item in January 2004, (VWG/Airhead Parts) has sold 263
of these with nary a peep about &quot;hard-to-fit&quot; or &quot;doesn't fit&quot; from the
shops that we mainly supply to (including Bus Depot).  I have an NOS Boot
and one of VWG's here side by side on my desk and cannot tell the difference
in materials, shore hardness (how hard or soft it is), size or shape that
would keep it from fitting properly on Troy's Bus.

A few calls to stores &amp; installing shops this afternoon that have bought
large quantities of this boot for feedback yielded no complaints, so I am at
a loss to explain the cause of Troy's problem (Too late in the afternoon to
call Bus Depot, so Ron, chime in here if you have any feedback from
customers) or to offer a solution.

Keep in mind the one VWG/Airhead Parts makes and supplies currently is for
models equipped with the 55A alternator.  It will not fit the 70A Optional
alternator setup.  VWG/Airhead Parts is in preproduction on the 70A Boot due
late this spring or summer.

As to different manufacturers, there was only the OEM and VWG/Airhead
Parts.  Troy may have confused this boot with the infamously repro'd
Dipstick Boot that ratwell has done a comparison on (speaking of
which, VWG/Airhead Parts is undergoing a rather rigorous test phase on the
latest repro dispstick boot sample for fit and durability - hope to have
them available late this spring).

&gt; &gt; Yes.  And to clarify, the shroud side is loose...as opposed to
&gt; &gt; tight.  When the alternator is rotated into a more correct position,

&gt; &gt;opening.

&gt; That's bizarre. The one I got from BD as been no problem. Even after 3 alt
&gt; swaps since installation last summer.
&gt; Maybe it just needs to be rotated some?
