Subject: hole in floor?


I have a 79 bay, what is the purpose of the
hole in the center of the floor just in front
of the middle seat?  The PO had covered it up
with some duct tape under the mat.  If I remember
correctly it looked to be about 2&quot;, looks like
it would scoop air from the road.

Thanks,

Rob
