&gt; I don't know for sure on a Vanagon but on a Bay the roof is flatter on the
&gt; Westy. (from the factory???)  the upstairs bed would not fit right if you
&gt; just put the top on.

Only from '73-ish on though.  The old style that hinges
at the front has a rounded roof underneath, and an opening
that isn't much bigger, if at all, than that of a 
sunroof bus.

As for the Vanagon, the one I've seen from the inside didn't
seem to have the normal metal roof under the camper top.
Looked pretty much like on a late Bay to me, i.e., no
metal roof there at all, but a crossmember on which rests
the bed.  But this is only from looking -- I've never 
owned nor dismantled anything like that yet.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
