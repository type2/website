&gt; I'm just finishing a 74 Safare that my friend put a Porsche 914 engine

&gt; stouter cam than the VW. Takes a little getting used to the oil filler 
&gt; and
&gt; dipstick locations. Others have told me the metals in the Porsche are 
&gt; better
&gt; than VW, but I haven't heard any substantiation on that. Any other 
&gt; opinions?
&gt; Better head flow or anything else different on the Porsche?

On the Type 4 engine, I don't think Porsche used any better metals, 
except perhaps for the valves (didn't the Porsche Type 4s have 
sodium-filled valves for better heat dissipation?)

Besides cam differences, the Porsche heads also used larger valves than 
the VW heads.  Not sure about stroke/piston shape.

In any case, while the Porsche flavor of Type 4 is a great little 
engine, they're not as advanced as the similar vintage 911 engine.  It 
really is a VW engine with some performance tweaks.
