&gt; List,
&gt; 
&gt; i was just wondering what exactly is the cv.  My bus just recently started
&gt; making a loud clunking noise after traveling at higher speeds for a while.
&gt; Espeacially while accelerating.  Maybe i am having a similiar problem if
&gt; anyone can help me deterimine the culprit of my noise i would appreciate it.

CV means &quot;constant velocity&quot;--the whole term is &quot;constant velocity joint.&quot;
If you look at the back wheels from underneath the Bus, here's what you will
see...the wheel, a big hunk of machined steel, a rubber boot that looks a
little like an accordion, a steel bar (the driveshaft) running up to the
transmission at around a 20 degree angle, another boot, another big hunk of
machined steel, and finally the transmission. These two big hunks of
machined steel are the CVs. In them you will find another hunk of machined
steel and six steel balls. These things allow the power to be transferred
along a slight bend and also allow the wheels to move up and down
independently. While they are called constant velocity joints, if one fails
you will suffer an immediate lack of velocity along that side of the
vehicle.

A quick check is to get under the bus, grab the driveshaft and make like
you're pumping iron by trying to push it straight up. If you can do it at
either end, the end you can do it at needs a new CV. (If you can do it at
both ends, you really have problems.)
