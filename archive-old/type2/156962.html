Subject: Re: [T2] oil temp?

Mike Benthin has already done that.  See the archives.  Don't  mess with the VDO guages.  I've never gotten mine to work properly  with either a dipstick sender or a sender in the taco plate.  A  good head temp guage is next on my list.  But I may buy the 11'  thermometer in the meantime.  That's long enough that I can snake  it around under the bus and tie it to the side mirror.  :)   Cheers...KR

thermometer can only be read if you pull over.  Is the next 
development to make the probe of this thermometer a permanent 
substitute for the dipstick, marked with the same oil levels, and 
mfr of a long connection to the humble $7 gauge promoted to the glory 
of the dashboard?
