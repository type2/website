Subject: Re: RE: [T2] Fuel Injection Parts Photos - and Megasquirt

Intake air sensor - used the MS standard GM air sensor, put a hole in the air intake box and JB-welded a pipe fitting into the hole.  It is a necessary sensor because the air density is part of the fuel equation, and is correlated to air temperature.

TPS - this is more interesting. I bought a used 914 throttle body which is the same as the VW part except for the extended throttle shaft poking out the bottom (as installed). The 914 had on it a switch style TPS. You need a potentiometer type for MS. I bought the Bosch part std on Volvo 850s (FCP Groton for Volvo parts). I made an adaptor of 3/16&quot; aluminum since the mounting holes did not line up and then I didn't even need to cut the shaft. Works perfectly.

O2 sensor - std 1 wire Bosch part on my Vanagon since it is a California model. You can have a bung welded in place if you do not have one.  Here is a link to an early installation on a Bus. He improvised the O2 sensor installation and doesn't even use a TPS.

Maybe you can share your experiences with 
&gt; the following items and how you incorporated them into the engine 
&gt; or eliminated them?
&gt; 
&gt; Intake air sensor (if you needed this, not sure from the MS website)
&gt; Throttle position sensor
&gt; Oxygen Sensor
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Corbett
