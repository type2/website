Subject: Re: [T2] Thinking ahead 30 steps or so

Mark,

#1 yes you can leave clutch hardware out.

#2 yes, but why....is this trans a new unknown quanitity?....or are you 
just paranoid?&lt;grin&gt;.  The problem will be how to shift with no shifter 
and how to pull the clutch arm back enough to use it.

I have used a pair of vice grips on the hockey stick in order to shift it, 
but it's rough on scoring the metal.

Make *durn* sure you have everything strapped down and blocked up...yer 
gonna get some serious torque when you shift.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Two questions, just to remove some ambiguity in my mind:
 
 1. I'm going to be testing my engine and doing the first twenty-minute 
 run before installing it by bolting up the whole transmission (no &quot;old 
&gt; bellhousing&quot;). For this test, can I leave the clutch hardware out with 
&gt; impunity? (If there are leaks behind the flywheel, I'd rather they 
&gt; didn't foul the clutch disk right off).
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Once I've determined that there are no oil leaks (fingers crossed), 
&gt; can I install the clutch hardware (new), bolt the transmission back on, 
&gt; and test the clutch? That is, can I make gear changes and so forth with 
&gt; the transmission out of the bus? And if so, should I test with the 
&gt; engine running? Or would a &quot;static&quot; test be satisfactory?
