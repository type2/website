Subject: Anybody Have These?

&gt; I need the two lower cooling tins that go between the heater boxes and the
case for a '73 1700.

I don't believe these are critical for cooling. The cooling tins go above 
the pushrod tubes. The tins between the case and heater box are only stone 
guards to prevent damage to the pushrod tubes.
