I would get another mechanic...now, and insist that the flaps are
re-installed.

Your mechanic is wrong, period.  Refer to Gene Berg's technical writings
about the flaps.  He ran them himself.....few people have as much knowledge
about the ACVW motor then the late Gene Berg..............I doubt it very
seriously that your mechanic is more knowledgeable than gene.

Actually, those flaps have different angles to them that actually help aim
the air over the cylinders when open....taking them out assures uneven
cooling.  Also, taking them out assures you that for most short runs in your
car, your engine will not be warmed up, meaning decreased engine life.
Also, after you run it a while, take off your oil filler cap and look at the
grey sludge in it...no flaps encourages this to occur for the motor rarely
gets hot enough to get rid of the little moisture that gets in the
system....

My .02......I think that someone out there should really read some of Gene
Berg's technical writings in regards to this issue, and they will be sold.

&gt; &gt;Today, he told me that the Georgia heat justifies permanently removing

&gt;
&gt;  I don't see why he would bother....Call me old fashoined but I take the
&gt;  view as many others do that if VW put it in there,it's meant to be there.
&gt;
&gt;   He also indicated that the flaps
&gt; &gt;aren't too critical for warm-ups in the *reasonable* winters here...
&gt;
&gt;  That's probably true,but why permanantly disable the flaps? If the
weather
&gt;  is warm the concertina thermostadt thingy will open the flaps in a very
short
&gt;  time anyway and everythings sweet.If the thermostadt fails the flaps
&gt;  default to the open position anyway,again no problem with them left
in-situ.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I've never heard this before, and I certainly don't remember seeing it in
&gt; &gt;Muir.  Does anyone have any perspective on this?
&gt;
&gt;  VW built a world car (or van) It can/could be found in every continent on
&gt;  earth.The Australian scientific boffs even had two Beetles in Antartica
&gt;  back in the '60's.VWs were built to withstand (within reason) all
&gt;  manner of climatic conditions.They didn't for example put the flaps in
&gt;  ones destined for cold countries and leave them out of ones for hot
&gt;  climates,otherwise the Australian ones wouldn't have the flaps either.
&gt;  Even warm places have cool times and it's nice to have the engine up to
&gt;  operating temperature as soon as possible and if you need it,the heater
&gt;  will be a-happening too.Never before time in an aircooled VW!
&gt;
&gt;  I just don't understand why your mechanic would want to permanantly
disable
&gt;  something that can only be of benefit in cooler weather and have no
negative
&gt;  effect in warmer climates.
&gt;
&gt;  But that's just my opinion...
