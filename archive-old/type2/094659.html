Jack,

Just a personal opinion, but if I had the money, and was going to Baja.
I would dry sump the engine and add a large oil cooler and fan combo,
that way not only do you have a cooler, but you have a larger oil
capacity so that the oil has further time to cool before it is dropped
right back into the hot engine case. Again, this is just a personal
opinion, and im sure there are some reasons out there why you would not
want to do this. 

Jonathan

Glad you posted this. I'm heading to Baja where temps are often over
100, and also have a 79. I have a 1.5 quart extra sump that I have to
yank because it hangs too low for off-road in Baja, so I need to add a
cooler. .......
