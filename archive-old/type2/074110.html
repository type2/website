Billy,

My guess is that it is a casting artifact.  For whatever reason, they
needed a hole there.  There is nothing on top of that hole as far as I
have ever seen.  Maybe Stan has it, maybe there was some accesory pump or
something that needed access to the cam and that was how VW got it.  On
our motors, it is a nice place to put the oil temp sender and that is
about it.

On draining the oil prior to removal, I know that there are some people
out there who do drain their oil *thru* that hole.  When you release the
nuts holding the plate on, be sure to have a pan handy, as some oil will
surely spill out there.

Lastly, the two holes thru the plate for fastening are *not* symetrical
(on a diameter)!  It only goes on one way, don't force it!
