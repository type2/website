Several years ago a tire shop employee crunched the sink drain plumbing
under our '70 Westy with an
ill-placed floor jack.  They were willing to pay for repairs, but asked for
estimates from RV repair shops.

I got estimates from 4 different RV joints, including Camping World, and
every one insisted the repair parts would have to be ordered in from
Germany.  They all stuck to that story, even after I pointed out the clearly
readable US markings on the pipe and fittings.

Don't confuse me with facts, etc., etc.....

FWIW...

&gt;&gt;  The drains on Westies are inch-sized fittings and you should be able to
head down to any plumbing
supply house and pick up replacement parts, in both the US and in Europe.
