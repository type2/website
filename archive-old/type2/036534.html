Subject: burning oil

Hey all...when starting up my 71 today (with a 1600SP in it) I noticed
smoke rolling out of my drivers side tail pipe (beetle
muffler...hey!..it was cheap)  I revved it a bit and more smoke came
out...just out of that tailpipe...
so I'm thinking its the #3 or #4 cylinder thats burning oil...but it did
this for a short amount of time....30 seconds maybe... it has done this
before too...but just for short little spurts....it doesn't happen much
at all...but I'm curious as to why it happens.
could it be that the rings rotated so that the openings in the rings
were lined up letting a bit of oil into the combustion chamber and then
moving so it was sealed again?
This motor is a very strong motor and will propel Stella at 70-75mph if
i really want it to.  i keep it around 60-65 though.
I notice at the 70-75mph mark that Stella likes to eat oil...not
much...but a bit...

any insight?
thanks!
