Subject: colorado rockies camping this weekend

It's not too late to joins us.  Come for the day, or come for the 
weekend.  We will be at the Reverend's Ridge campground in Golden Gate 
Canyon State Park Friday and Saturday leaving Sunday morning...

The plan is to camp in &quot;Loop C&quot;.  I'll try to be there around noon-ish. 
  We're not terribly organized, and we're a pretty small group.  Please 
make sure you bring your own supplies, and perhaps some firewood to 
contribute to the group campfire.

Be there or be square.  Jon ... We'd love to see you for the day if 
nothing else.
