Subject: Re: [T2] engine seal how to

&gt;Richard is right.  I did it and it is very, very easy and will  make 
&gt;a big difference in engine temp.  Buy one today!

	But what does it cost compared with the solution I've found 
fine?  As mentioned to youse within this past fortnight,

		Stopping leaks from that engine compartment is 
essential to good cooling of the engine.  But the official gasket is 
needlessly expensive compared with a yard or so of Armathane 
(Armstrong corp of Canada) closed-cell foam crammed in all around the 
gap.  This material is sold as exterior thermal insulation for 
hot-water pipes.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;is it possible to replace the mangled, rotting, and missing engine seal
&gt;&gt;without removing the engine.  i have never seen any information on the
&gt;&gt;subject in my searching. my seal has completlely disappeared and i know that
&gt;&gt;i need one to insure proper air flow. i am thinking of buying the one listed
&gt;  &gt;on busdepot.
