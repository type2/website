&gt;1. This should be a 36 hp, or a 40?

I think 40hp..
&gt;
&gt;2. If the bumpers are original they should, or should not, have overriders?

US model should, Euro no.  Minor detail

&gt;3. Panel van should have basically no interior, right?

A panel should have plain gray hardboard panels in the roof, front doors,
and kick panels.  Thats it.

&gt;4. Can you win any money at shows with a truck like this, or do you guys 
&gt;just do it to show off? ;)

We do it to make the east-coast guys jealous.

&gt;5. This is too late for a split-case trans, right?

Yes, - mid '59 was the last split-case tranny

&gt;He's asking $6500. Once the Cruise Director talks some sense 
&gt;into me I imagine I'll share its location with the list. Groan.

Oye!  It better be _really_ nice!
