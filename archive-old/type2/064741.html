Subject: did the brakes, new axle leak problem

Hi. This weekend I did the rear brakes on my '66 Kombi. Thanks especially
to Thom and Clara for their advice. I spent most of Saturday afternoon
tracking down parts. The best tool I bought was a big piece of cast iron
shaped like an exclamation point. The head of the exclamation point has a
46mm hexagon cut into it, and the base has a 1/2&quot; square cut into it for
insertion of a flex bar. As I found out, you can also beat the hell out of
the base with a big hammer to get the axle nut to move.

Sunday: Spent one hour removing the nuts. I had been bathing them in Liquid
Wrench all week and they wouldn't budge, even with a 4' cheater bar. I got
out the propane torch, a 22 ounce ball peen hammer, and started heating and
banging the base of the aforementioned exclamation point tool. They came
right off.

I did the easy (nonleaking) brake first. It only took about two hours. I'm
glad I left the brake on the other side assembled for easy reference.
Changed the reduction box fluid (ack phth).

No on to the leaking brake. Couldn't find the leak. I took the top plug off
of the reduction box, then started to torque on the bottom plug when gear
oil started coming out of the top hole! What the...? Anyway, I drained the
box, then closed it up to see what would happen if I left it empty for a
couple of hours. When I came back it was nearly half full again of clean
gear oil. I presume this is coming from the transmission case. Is this
normal? If not, what does it mean?

Next problem: Removed the bearing cover to change the seals. Gear oil oozed
out of the bearings while I had the bearing cover removed. The seal kit
given to me by the FWVAPS (kit # 113 598 315, but on the price tag it says
#111 598 051A) has an orange paper gasket, 2 rubber rings, 2&quot; and 3/4&quot;, a
flat metal washer, that hard plastic thingy with the rubber washer and
spring inside it, and a cotter pin. Well, the only things I could find in
there were the hard plastic thingy and the paper gasket. Where do the other
parts go? Did they give me the wrong kit? The metal washer and the small
rubber ring don't fit on the axle. The big rubber ring was the same size as
the inside of the bearing cover, so I figured it goes there. I have Muir,
the RMMW catalog, and another manual, and couldn't figure it out. I put
everything back together, and now I have tranny fluid leaking from the
between the axle and the bearing cover. HELP! I don't want to put
everything back together with the oil leak, but I have to get the bus out
of the garage by tomorrow. Thank you in advance for your continued (or is
that continuous) advice.
