&gt; VW engines run like crap at 14.7:1. Stoic is chemically correct, but not

Like I said, 14:1 or richer for air cooled.  I set mine at 13.8:1.

&gt; if you swapped the carbs and had to run leaner jets I will agree that in
&gt; YOUR SITUATION (which is rare) you experienced what you experienced.

I did not run leaner jets as I was happy with the increase in richness.

&gt; But, if
&gt; you used a different set of carbs, jet size is irrelevant, since you used
&gt; different carbs (even if they were the same size and model).

But, I did not use different carbs, took em straight from the 1800 to the 2.0L.

&gt; Tuning hundreds
&gt; of cars has shown to me that even the &quot;same&quot; combination uses different jets
&gt; on different engines.

Same as I have found.   Just depends on the resultant mixture you are looking
for.

&gt; I have even had some engines that needed different jets on each CYLINDER.

With everthing cc'd, decked, matched length rod,  and matched piston pin
heights, I would agree that you could benefit from a larger jet on the #3 cyl in
the type 1 engine.  Now an inline engine does tend to run rich nearer the carb
and leaner at the further cylinders.  If you had one carb per cylinder, other
than the type one, all should be the same or you should start checking for some
other problem.

VW retarded the spark to the #3 cyl Type 1 to assist in it's cooling.  What
adjustment do you make with a 009 or 050 mechanical advance distributors,
neither of which have this retard built into the point cam?

How do you adjust the FI systems to obtain a variety of fuel flows to individual
cylinders? Vary fuel injectors with different oriface sizes?

Love,

Mike D.
