Hello all,
The time has come to sell my beloved '81 Vanagon Westfalia.  Here are 
the details:

'81 Vanagon L Westfalia camper.  2.0L air-cooled engine, Bosch 
L-Jetronic fuel injection.  Deluxe camper package with three-way 
refrigerator, propane stove, and sink.  Approximately 126,000 miles.

2 rebuilt AVP cylinder heads
2 Lobro CV joints &amp; Bilstein CV boots
clutch master cylinder 
clutch slave cylinder
rear brake shoes
2 heat exchangers

pushrod tubes and seals
crankshaft main seal (fan end)
pilot bearing
throwout bearing
crankshaft main seal (flywheel end)
vacuum hoses
intake manifold boots
intake manifold to cylinder head gaskets
fuel injector seals
voltage regulator

OTHER GOOD STUFF:
The van is in very good condition.  It passed, in June, Virginia safety 
and emissions inspections.  It was repainted the original color (medium 
blue) shortly before I bought it from a vanagon listmember, Rick Koller 
(inquiries about the van's history before I got it should be sent to him 
_at_ rkoller_at_helix.nih_dot_gov).  The body is in good shape with the exception 
of a couple rust spots which I will detail below.  The interior is in 
great shape.  The seats still have the original funky upholstery, which, 
in the front, is covered by comfy seat covers (easily removable if you 
so desire).  The cabinetry is all in excellent condition, the pop-top 
canvas is perfect (no rips/tears), the upper bunk fabric is perfect, the 
lower bunk/seat fabric shows signs of wear but has no rips/tears.  The 
fridge works on all three power sources, the stove works, and the sink 
water pump works.  The van comes with both an oil temperature gauge and 
oil pressure gauge installed, as well as a Sony in-dash detachable face 
CD player.  The van also comes with Bosch front fog lights and a red 
rear fog light, both wired to a stock VW fog light switch in the 
instrument cluster.  The van has all the curtains and all are in good 
shape, including the windshield curtain, the sliding door curtain, and 
the rear hatch bug screen (in excellent condition!).  The pop-top has 
the skylight (which is apparently rare on the earlier models) with bug 
screen and curtain (and it doesn't leak).  The van also has both tables 
and table supports.  The van is riding on 4 Michelin XZX 185R14 
reinforced tires, which still have a reasonable amount of tread left.  
The front brakes have PLENTY of pad left.  The van also comes with a 
couple boxes of spare parts, including lots of FI spares, gaskets, wheel 
bearings, etc.

THE NOT SO GOOD STUFF:
Rust:  There is not a lot of rust in total, but there are a couple 
spots.  There is of course the typical seam rust, which is just now 
starting to bust out in a few places.  It's not bad yet, you have to 
look closely to see it.  The driver's side rocker panel has rust 
bubbling through the paint.  No rust is visible yet, but you can see the 
bubbling.  Same thing with the driver's side rear fender lip. The bottom 
of the sliding door has a small spot of rust, and the bottom sliding 
door track has some rust (as is typical).  There is some rust under the 
seal of the driver's side middle side window that needs to be dealt 
with.  And there is some rust under the windshield seal.  That rust is 
surface rust at this point, but it has made the sealing surface uneven 
and as a result the windshield leaks rainwater at each lower corner.  
The interior has the typical Westy Wallpaper Disease in some parts.  
It's not severe, but it is showing signs.  Some of the paper is peeling.
The vinyl covering over the driver's door panel is shrinking and sagging 
a bit.
I'm keeping the nifty Hella 500 driving lights (but the fog lights are 
staying) and the CB radio.

This is all I can think of at the moment.  I am asking $3300, but of 
course this is negotiable.  My e-mail address is bartnik_at_hotmail_dot_com or 
you can call me at (703) 426-5427.  The van is located in Fairfax, 
Virginia.  Also, you can see the van at 
http://www.type2_dot_com/bartnik/myvan.htm. 

I will be putting the van in the Washington Post classifieds this 
weekend (weekend of 10/24).  It would be nice if a listmember got it, 
though.  About the only times I will be available to show the van will 
be weekends and weekday evenings.  
 

Thanks,

Sean Bartnik
