Just put new engine in my 82 westy.  All elec/fuel/vac lines hooked up correct.  Engine ran briefly then stopped.  Discovered that i left alternator unplugged, figure i drained the battery.  Plugged it in, hooked up different battery(fully charged) tested to see that engine would still turn by hand.  Tried to start....nothing...just clunk from the starter.  It appears to be engaging---i can see a little twitch on the alt belt when i try to turn over but doesn't even bbudge the motor.  Before i condemn the starter, anybody have any ideas or suggestions?  and yes, i do have oil in it.  Doest this sound like a starter/electrical problem--like the starter does'nt have the power to turn overf, or something more serious?
Thanks
Mike Edwards
82 Westy
