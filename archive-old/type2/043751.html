Subject: [T2] RE: Engine Mounts Riddle

&gt;How easy is it to fit new engine mounts on a 1973 Bay.

Assuming your 73 has a type IV motor and not a type 1 motor, the following 
paragraph on motor mounts applies.  If you don't know the difference, just look 
in the engine compartment.  If there is a fan in the back center with a belt 
running almost horizontal over to the alternator it is a type IV.  If there is 
just a pulley in the back center with a belt running upwards and to the right 
to the alternator then it is a type 1 style motor and the following does not 
apply.

Motor mounts can be replaced on a type IV motor without removing the motor.  If 
I remember right, you will need to remove the muffler and both heat 
exchangers.  Brace the engine under the main part of the case at whatever 
height it is sitting at (you can do this without raising the rear of the bus, 
but you'd have more room to work if it was up in the air a bit).  Then you can 
drop the engine bar by removing the 2 (13mm?) nuts that attach the engine to 
the bar and the 4 13mm nuts/bolts (2 at each side?) that attach the bar to the 
bus.  Once the bar is out of the way, you should be able to remove the nut from 
the top of each mount and remove them.  Installation, as the say, is the 
reverse order of removal.

&gt;Is there a winter/summer setting on my engine. A mechanic told me that
&gt;it was	set on a winter setting. If so can I change this easily?

I've been puzzling over this for a day now and still haven't arrived at any 
conclusions.  The only possibilities I've come up with are:
1.) Choke mechanism in place and functioning properly?
2.) Thermostat and flaps in place and functioning properly?
3.) Heater boxes wired open?

Unless your mechanic can give you some plausible specifics on what he meant (if 
so, please post them to the list!) I'd say he's full of it and should get no 
more of your business.
