Subject: Re: Kombi definition w/insurance ?

A personal opinion...

Kombi is used a generic term but isn't realy; so what makes a 'Kombi' a
'Kombi'?

If Kombis were sold with optional headliners and seats in the back (see
recent posts) then the only thing that makes it uniquely different is
the chassis no.

If you have your van/bus/camper insured as a Kombi but following an 
accident your insurers find its chassis number does not begin 23 (before
1981 model year) or WV2X (before 1992 model year) then that may render
your insurance invalid!

Even having a pop-top that your insurers don't know about may cause you
problems as thats a structural modification (removes one of the cross
beams in the roof)

I think the Kombi had only basic trim, for higher trim it was necessary
to begin with a one of the minibus shells.

So I say check your chassis no and tell your insurers exactly what you
have eg. for chassis no 2882nnnnnn with a Westfalia conversion tell them
&quot;I have a 1978 7 seat minibus Transporter converted to a camper van by 
Westfalia with 4 seats and a rising roof&quot;. 

I also sent photographs with the insurance application when I changed 
policies a year or two ago, This covers modifications you have forgotten
about like spare tyre on the front, extra lights, air dam, special 
wheels...

Be straight with them, then they won't have a chance to screw you.
