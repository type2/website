Subject: Re: Need Help with VDO Oil temp Sender

&gt; 
&gt; I just installed a VDO oil temp sender and gauge.  I seem to have everything
&gt; hooked up right, but when I start my bus, the gauge slowly moves all the way
&gt; to the right.  I rechecked the connections and can't seem to find any problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Think I got a bad gauge or sender?
&gt; 
Sounds like you don't have everything hooked up right.

I would make sure the wire to the sensor hasn't come off and grounded
somewhere.  Otherwise, re-check your connections and make sure you have
followed the instructions carefully.

Also check the wiring as it is on the gauge, if you have wires touching
back there (it is kinda crowded) it can make the gauge do weird things.

I once had a situation where my oil pressure gauge would be fine until I
turned on the parkings lights (and hence, the internal gauge lighting).
Then the gauge would not light up, but the needle would go all the way
to full pressure.  Wiggling some wires on the back solved that one --
something to do with the grounding of the gauge light I imagine.
