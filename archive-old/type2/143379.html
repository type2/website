Subject: Re: [T2] finally picking up my engine from Boston Bob

How do these warranties from Raby, Bus Depot, Aircooled_dot_net and Boston Bon work if they have some massive failure just 50 miles down the road? Do they pay for the tow and the fix if the problem was something verifiable like an oil gallery plug? Just curious... 

Yeah bad karma flies further and faster than good karma... As a business owner you've got to be sensitive to that.

As nice as these turnkey engines sound, I'll have to stick to building them myself b/c 1st I couldn't afford one and 2nd, so far nobody has done work (paint/engine/etc) like I would. Not saying I am better than everyone else I've used, but simply that I can't afford to hire the quality I can get by sweating over a project for months and months fixing and refixing my mistakes until it's JUST right. &lt;grin!&gt; Try long enough and we're bound to get it right - right?
