Andy, et ALL...

I didn't mean to imply that I &quot;coined&quot; the word
&quot;FART&quot;, but that I was to blame for it being an
acronym on this list
(Frequently-Annoying-Recurring-Thread...F.A.R.T.)...

I'm neither proud nor ashamed for it though...

By the way, the term &quot;FART&quot; is becoming a &quot;FART&quot; in
itself...

Get over it for Christ's sake!!!!

&gt; &gt; I guess I'm to blame for the acronym (or maybe
&gt; &gt; &quot;netcronym&quot;;-) of FART... A couple of months ago,
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; half-jokingly wrote to the list about some
&gt; annoying
&gt; &gt; thread that kept popping up (geez, I think it
&gt; *was*
&gt; &gt; oil, now that I think of it!) and proposed calling
&gt; &gt; these items F.A.R.T.(s) for
&gt; &gt; &quot;Frequently-Annoying-Recurring-Threads&quot;. Get it?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Whups, Jamie, a quick search of the archives turned
&gt; up references
&gt;
http://vw.i405_dot_com/sm.asp?path=\type2_at_primenet\03\0171.txt
&gt; as far back as Jul 96.
&gt; Call me an old fart...
