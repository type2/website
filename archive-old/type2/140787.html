Subject: RE: [T2] Weird signal light behavior?

Poor connection somewhere - possibly the ground from the taillight to the
body (spade connector inside the engine compartment between hatch and
taillight housing). Stepping on the brakes provides an additional path to
ground and thus increases current.
Sounds like you have a mechanical flasher. Do yourself the favor of getting
an electronic Hella relay - any VW (and most other European cars) at your
favorite junk yard will have one waiting for in their fuse panel.

My signal lights work normally when I am driving and sitting still, UNLESS I
put the brake lights on. If I do, the signal light speeds up.
