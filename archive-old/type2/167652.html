&gt; Jason,
&gt; It is conventional to rent one's tanks from the
&gt; welding supply house and buy the gas that is in
&gt; them.  I do annual rentals as would most in a
&gt; &quot;shop&quot; setting.

I did a cost comparison, and for the occasional hobby welder it seemed
buying the tank was cheaper in the long run, your right rentals work best
in a production setting.  I use maybe a tank a year so for me it wasn't
very cost effective.
