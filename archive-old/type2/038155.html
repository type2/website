Subject: Re: Valve Cover Gaskets

Replacing the valve cover gaskets can definitely be done with the engine
in. From under each side of the engine, pop off the bail holding the
valve cover on (I use a door panel puller), replace the valve cover
gasket, and voila! Some people a) use a little Permatex to hold the
gasket to the cover and smear a little oil or grease on the top of the
gasket or b) smear a little oil or grease on both sides and pass on the
Permatex. (If you use the wrong kind of Permatex it hardens on there and
is a real bear to scrape off -- nail polish remover helps). Carefully
replace the valve cover, pop the bail back on, and you're good to go.

You may as well do a valve adjustment while you're down there.

Head gaskets, I believe, have to be replaced with the engine out.

&gt; I need to change my valve cover gaskets and was wondering, can I do this
&gt; without taking the engine out?  ('72 Transporter)  It's got the stock
&gt; 1700 type IV engine in it, please tell me I can do it without taking the
&gt; engine out, I've done it once, and it's not a fun job.  Actually that's
&gt; why it's leaking oil.  I took the engine out, and after I put it back in,
&gt; it's now leaking a bit of oil.  It never did before I took the engine
&gt; out, and I didn't do anything to the engine, I just took the fuel tank
&gt; out and changed it!  Ugh.  It does look like the oil is coming out of the
&gt; passenger side valve cover, so I'm going to put new gaskets on them.
