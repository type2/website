Subject: Re: [T2] locking gas cap

You could make a pair of hasps that bolt under the three filler bolts and
then cover the bolts when locked over the cap.  Nothing visible from

&gt;  My 70' came from the p.o. with an aftermarket locking cap.
&gt; It used a collar that clamped around the filler neck with a set screw.
&gt; I took it off cuz I didn't really feel the need for it, and I didn't want to
&gt; loose the one and only key.
&gt; Also, as I recall that collar might have had a tendency to want to spin
&gt; while opening.
