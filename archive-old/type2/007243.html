Subject: Paint code

&gt;What is the paint code for the black paint?
&gt;(Hah, I knew you were waiting for a paint code question)

And if somebody got the paint code list, and begin to give codes on this
mailing list, may I have the code for the paint of my &quot;olive&quot; green '76
van??


Thank you

Hi!

The CCCs are a bunch of VW Bus and Vanagon owners who get together and
go camping several times a year. CCC used to stand for California
Camping Crazies - but - since we just had Joel from Alabama and Dave
from Texas drive all the way to Mammoth Lakes, CA. for our last one -
maybe we'll have to consider changing our name!

:-)

We have all sorts of fun on these trips - great food - awesome company
- - musical jam sessions - and ALWAYS a butt kicker of a fire. Not to
mention truly fine dog time and lately, super cool kid contacts.

Maybe you all can get it together and join us for a CCC Blow-out
sometime!

:-)

Kath, Mark and Her Majesty ('68 VW Bus - as far from original as we
could make her!)
