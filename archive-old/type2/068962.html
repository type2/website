Subject: visit to VW Canada

The visit to Volkswagen Canada was prompted by the discovery of a pair of
Volkswagen Canada Remanufactured stickers on the 1700cc motor I recently
removed from a '73 parter.  (Pumpkin)  I called VWC to inquire about the
stickers / numbers and was referred to Mr. Voytek Okulicz.  I think I
caught him on a good day.  He spoke with me briefly during the first call
and was immediately able to identify the engine as a 1700 rebuild, but
computer records didn't go back far enough to give an exact date.

Voytek noted that I was living in Sudbury, &quot;in the middle of nowhere&quot; , a
common Toronto misconception, and offered to &quot;help&quot; me with engine parts
and a tour of the facility should I wish to come on down!  I was hooked.
In the days following that initial call I ran the gambit from taking the
whole family for the tour to settling for simply my good friend and help
mate, Eric Moore.  After all, I'd need the extra space for those parts
right??

Wednesday November 20th, the date was set.  I called Voytek the day
previous.  He remembered me but seemed somewhat distant.  7 am and we were
on the way in Moo, my 88 Westy.

400 Km and 4 hours later, we're in the big smoke, an hour for lunch and we
finally spotted VW Canada's remanufacturing plant in Scarborough, a suburb
of Toronto. Scarborough is a city waiting to happen.  (20 Astonbee Rd  for
Torontoites) VWC was in a very large nondescript building.  My friend and I
saw very few VW's in the employee's lot, but a few spiffy models did dot
the landscape!

Voytek Okulicz, P.Eng. met us quickly, and we off.  NO PICTURES were
allowed. I was not pleased.  As soon as we entered the plant my eyes were
drawn to huge bins filled with connecting rods... the bins were easily the
size of Moo!  Other similar bins contain other pieces that were easily
stored in the bins, that is, flat.

The Plant is laid out in a similar fashion to engine dismantling. There was
a section that took the heads, another for the casings, another for the
cranks another for the cams and so on and so on.  A large section was
simply dedicated to WASHING the engine pieces.  In the same area could be
found high temperature ovens to burn off old gaskets. The same spot dealt
with valves and valve springs. There were bins of valves springs and boxes
and boxes of push rods.  All of these stations had crews working on engine
rebuilding.  One fellah I saw was working on stacks of heads drilling or
inserting coils, I'm not sure just what, but we were told he does batches
of 100 at a time.   All parts of the plant were simply a stage where one
engine's part was either being taken apart, or another was being rebuilt.
All parts were sandblasted and repainted.

One really interesting portion of the plant was set aside from the others.
It was staffed by just two mechanics.  Their job was to take brand new
engines apart.  I mean just shipped from Germany engines, not yet in North
America.  Their job was to develop manuals for VW mechanics because the
engines were originally assembled via robots. The two Toronto employees had
to develop written guidelines for human hands!! There were a number of
engines in that room, all on stands all in some stage of dismemberment
except for one... it was a brand new porche engine, the only one in NA.

Two other tidbits.  We were told the output of the plant was at the VERY
least, 120 engines a day.  The engines are packed in VW labelled Blue
wooden boxes.  There were hundreds in the plant, and were told that a
nearby warehouse was filled to the roof. This plant supplies all of the US
and Canada with rebuilds.  The other tidbit was simply that VWC's
remanufacturing plant is now doing contract work for GM and sure enough,
there was a part of the plant where the Mopar and GM trademarks were easily
spotted.

I spotted several type four 2000cc engines on a trolley... all about to be
rebuilt all a shining silver colour.  It was weird to see an engine in a
plant filled with everything but what I had in my basement.  I was surprise
I actually knew what it was! ( I'm new to all this remember!)  I guess they
don't do a lot of 70's vintage rebuilds but they are still available
through VW.  The Scarborough plant will not sell to employees or to the
public... this is too bad.   There was a very very very nice looking beetle
engine on a stand sitting in the middle of the assembly line where they do
&quot;batch jobs&quot;.  I sure would have liked to take a few snaps!

Voytek told me it takes a team of two one hour to do the most complicated
head that VW makes.  To do the heads of Folly's 72 vintage 1700 would take
15 minutes. He mentioned that obsolete parts were broken and tossed out!  I
got weak in the knees at that point and I intend to write to beg for stuff!

Oh well.  The tour lasted a grand total of 20 to 25 minutes.  I was under
the impression that we were imposing.  Out the door,  a handshake, no
cranks, no tin, no gaskets, no nothin'!  We were on our way home, another
400 Km to go, another 4 hours for 20 minutes.  But, I love it.
