Hello Listees,

   I just wanted to share with the list and with Scott Afred that it was
basically Scott's website about the Wayback Machine, pictures of it,
storyies about driving in it, and camping excursions in it that sold me n
wanting to get a camper.  I can remember showing my Aunt the website and
telling her I wanted to travel  in one for months.  That's exactly what I
am doing right know -- living in Bogle for about 8 months or so and just
traveling.   I also remember just staring at the Wayback Machines lines
and curves and just being enraptured by its style.  When I saw Scott's
post today that it was sold I felt as if I was losing my own bus in a way.
I would just like to thank Scott for his great Website.  Thanks Scott. I
would also like to thanks the listee that responded to my posts thay
helped, as always, a great deal.

        Someone asked me &quot;why I sleep in my bus when I could sleep in a
perfectly good motel&quot;  I said &quot;why sleep in a motel when you could sleep
in a perfectly good bus&quot; :&gt;

&gt; Morning all,
&gt; 
&gt; Well we are no longer bus owners. The Wayback Machine left Las Vegas on a
&gt; trip to her new home in Portland, Oregon. Just got a note from Andrea and
&gt; Roger saying that it was a long drive but they made it just fine. 
&gt; 
&gt; I have a Mr. Swampy -- that they didn't need in Oregon -- for sale as well
&gt; as a brand new Solex for a '71. I didn't grab the PICT number but know it
&gt; was the model for a '71. Make an offer on either and I'd be happy to ship
&gt; them.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll be leaving the list. It's provided a lot of great help over the years
&gt; and I've made a lot of e-friends -- and even met some of them in Mammoth!
&gt; I've been asked to leave my site up by lots of folks and so I will. 
&gt; 
&gt; Good driving,
&gt; 
&gt; Scott
