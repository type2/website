Subject: Re: [T2] Stinger on a type 4 engined bus?

I Have a 72 and am running a straight header with a monza style glass pack.
I have thought of just cutting the glass pack off right after it's pipe
connects to the header and just welding the stinger onto that thus having
the stinger shoot out the right side..

&gt; I have seen it done with t4s put into bugs,  but the question is...did
&gt; yours have a cat on the exhaust. dont remember what year cat converters
&gt; were put on.  This may make it difficult to do in a lot of states.
