Subject: Re: [T2] Another shim/spacer question

At 10:16 AM 02/24/2001 EST, you wrote:
&gt;I just re-read the article in the library on cylinder spacers and CR. It 
&gt;indicates that the total shim/spacer thickness doesn't have to be the same 
&gt;for every cylinder. I could definitely use an extra spacer on one of my 
&gt;cylinders to equalize the CR, but I would think that an extra .009 height 
&gt;would rack the head enough to keep it from sealing.
&gt;
&gt;Any advice? Again, I'd appreciate a direct reply, if you would be so kind.

Both cylinders tops when torqued must be dead on plane, just like the
heads. Verify that. Then verify the head space of the pistons with base
shims in place. If they are not the same, you have a warped case or
improperly cylinder base cuts, (they must be in plane as well), or
mismatched pistons or cylinder of differing length or a combination of
synergies. Rod lengths can differ as well.

That's why you must make these specific measures to have a balanced and
sealed CR of known value.
