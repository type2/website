&gt; I was going to do a FI install on a 74 bus and I didn't even consider 
&gt; cobbling the fuel return.  I figure if automotive engineers decided that it 
&gt; was necesary for running FI on the bus (and all other CIS vehicles for that 
&gt; matter) I WAS'NT going to second guess them, particularily on issues 
&gt; surrounding fuel delivery.
&gt; 
&gt; Either swapping for a later fuel tank or installing a fuel sump of some sort 
&gt; seems to pass the muster of most folks that do this kind of thing 
&gt; proffessionally.  Check under a late 80's VW Fox the next time you visit a 
&gt; u-pull-it.  They have an easily removable small plastic tank that appears to 
&gt; function as a sump.  
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe someone on the list with more knowledge than I could comment on the 
&gt; necesary capacity of a functional sump?

Keep in mind the purpose of the return line.  It's supposed to keep a flow
of cool fuel from the tank to prevent vapor lock in the pump.  The fuel
tank has a large enough surface area to transfer the heat picked up by the
fuel to the outside (even though it pretty much lives in an enclosed area)

A small sump contains a small
volume of fuel will be picking up the heat, which cannot escape easily 
through the small surface area of the tank.  You've increased complexity
without reaching the desired result.

I see two ways around this.  One way is to install a small heat exchanger
between the return line and the tee.  This will transfer the excess heat
to the air much better than a sump tank.  An oil cooler or even a power
steering cooler would work well for this.

In my '71, the fuel fitting is essentially a washer with a tube brazed
through it.  You might be able to make a custom version with two tubes
that will put the return gas right where it belongs, in the tank.  There
will be complications with the fuel screen and you might want to dispense
with it and run a good in-line filter in the outlet line.  That way you
could put some separation between the inlet and outlet lines.
