Subject: Re: [T2] Powder coating - more

Powder coating melts at 425-450 degrees F. so if your rims are getting that
hot around the bolts because of your drums or discs, I would suggest that
you have problems. Perhaps someone with a temp gun can shoot a reading off a
lugnut and let us know? I would REALLY doubt my lugnuts are getting anywhere
near that temp.
Courtney

&gt; Indeed, I have heard that under the heat of the brakes the powder coat
will
&gt; become elastic and relax the bolts.
