Broken rotor??
Dirty points??
Unplugged or bad condenser??
Have someone turn the engine while you hold a grounded test light on the
coil terminal that goes to the condenser. If it flashes your points are
working, if not your problem could be there.
This is assuming throwing a new coil at it doesn't work.
Good luck
Brian

Subject: [T2] new engine in 71 bus will not start


So I am having a couple of problems in getting my brand new engine to go.
The first problem is no spark coming out of the coil. I have 12v coming into
the coil from the switch up front but when I pull the center wire off the
cap and hold it close to a ground while having the bus turned over I see no
spark of any color. Can a coil be bad? It is such a simple thing that I find
it hard to believe. I have a compufire installed but it isn't a complicated
install so I don't think that it can be wrong, as long as the wires are on
the correct terminals. Problem #2 was discovered before I knew there was no
spark. When I am turning the engine over without the plugs in, so as to
prime it, it turns like a champ. Once the plugs are back in, it is VERY slow
in turning over. Everything on the engine is brand new so should I just
assume that it is the strong compression of a brand new engine that is
causing this? This is my first vw so any sage like advice would be most
appreciated.
