Subject: Re: [T2] RE:Finishing Interior

Barry:
There is a company called Mohawk that makes all kinds of stains and mail
orders them.
Basically, I know of two different types: oil and aniline dye. Maybe the
aniline would take even through the previous finish.
If anyone is interested, I can find out more about Mohawk, my wife buys lots
of it.
