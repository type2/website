Subject: RE: [T2] gauge mounting

If you are going to mount only three, and don't mind cutting your dash, I
would mount them under the stereo.

		Subject:	[T2] gauge mounting

		    I have decided what gauges I am going to install  and
decided on 
		three to protect my new engine.
		I am going to purchase a head temp and oil pressure first.
Later on I'll 
		add oil temp. So I want to plan
		on provisions for three. I am not really sure where I want
to mount them 
		yet. Where are yours mounted and how do you like them there?
