Subject: Re: [T2] I really need help, folks

Crazy - but what brand plugs?

We had a weird problem with Autolite plugs in an RX-7 just like this.

Went back for a set of NGK and all was well.

&gt; &gt; Hello Ray      How you doing , other than the
&gt; &gt; firing problem.
&gt;
&gt;Well, I'm doing ok, except that I gotta get this
&gt;thing ready for HCBF.  I would hate to miss it--
&gt;no pun intended.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Did you use new
&gt; &gt; plugs?
&gt;
&gt;yes, and I also switched the plugs that fired ok
&gt;in other cyl's to #4, no change.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;you have re-checked the valves,
&gt;
&gt;no but the valve cover's coming off tonight, I'm
&gt;suspicious of a cam problem because I think I've
&gt;ruled out anything electrical.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; firing order,
&gt;
&gt;several times
&gt;
&gt;vacuum leaks, srayed
&gt; &gt; carb cleaner into it to see if it fired.
&gt;
&gt;yeah.  Since I replaced the plug on #3, it has
&gt;fired ok.  I cannot think of any reason that a
&gt;carb issue would allow #3 to fire and cause #4 to
&gt;be dead.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks, Mark.  I hope to see you soon, brother.

Ciao!
