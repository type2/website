And I answered:

I am not sure that pic does you justice. Perhaps you need to go to this one:
 http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/aircoolsystem.html

I believe you guys want the plastic ring that goes between the alt and the tin, K in this pic.
Be aware that there is early and late tin and ring. If you scroll down to K, you will see the
part numbers.

K. 021-119-281U Alternator Coverplate, Used 1972 to 1974  CALL

K. 022-119-281 Alternator Coverplate, New 1972 to 1979  CALL

K. 022-119-281U Alternator Coverplate, Used 1972 to 1979  CALL

Note: When using the 022-119-281 plate as a replacement on 1972 to 1974 models, the plastic gasket for the
Alternator must be replaced with newer style - order 022-903-203.

At least they list the early ring part number on the charging page. But the charging page does not tell about
the tin difference.

F.  021-903-203U  Plastic Seal Ring, Used, 1972 to 1974  CALL

F.  022-903-203  Plastic Seal Ring, 1975 to 1979  $4.90

Unless you knew which tin you have, you cannot know which ring you need.
I try to keep the tin and the ring as a set when I find them. That ring seems to be a
part like the Hoover Bit and flaps on a type1 engine.... ''VW wasted a lot of money putting
this extra crap on........''
