It's one modification that many with 72 * first year for dual carbs* 73, and
74 busses seem to go for.  I installed a single  Holley/Weber carb on a 73 I
had a few years back.  Could never get it to run right was always on the
rich side.  I think SCAT sells the manifold, single 2 bbl carb, and the OE
rebuilt dual carb setup as well......

Subject: [T2] Newbie with intake manifold question


&gt; Hi everyone, I am new to this list. My bus is '72
&gt; Westfalia. The question I have is this: Is there an
&gt; intake manifold that would allow the adaptation of a
&gt; single 2 bbl carb? has anyone out there had any
&gt; experience with such a setup and would you reccommend it
&gt; or not?
&gt;
