&gt; Karl (and others),
&gt;
&gt; This sounds like a good way to go.  Is the Vanagon distributor compatible
&gt; (in terms of advance curve etc) with the earlier ones?  If not, is there a
&gt; way of mixing 'n' matching parts between the two to make it work?  Anyone
&gt; know which other cars use the same ignition system as the Vanagon?  They
are
&gt; not too easy to find in junkyards but there are plenty of Golfs etc.
&gt;

The distributor vacuum and centrifical curves are almost the same as the
76-79 2.0L 021 905 205P or 022 021 905S except full centrifical comes in 200
rpms higher and vacuum advance is 2 degrees more. This is if you only
connect ported vacuum to the advance side of the dual vacuum element. The
021P orn 022S is a single vacuum dist. The 79 Cal/ 80 to 83.5 Cal Vanagon
039 905 205C is a dual unit, but you can use one side if you want. This is a
California-only distributor.
It is even closer in specs to a 021AB or 022AB which I believe fits 73-75
dual carb 1800's and 75 Cal FI 1800.
I don't know of any other distributors that will fit in a pancake engine
except pancake distributors. You can fit in type1 distributors, but you
wouldn't have enough advance.
