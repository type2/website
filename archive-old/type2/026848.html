Ed,

If you buy one just make sure they have pressure tested it in order to 
detect pinhole leaks that you may not see.  I threw a used cooler on when 
putting in a rebuilt 2.0L and it developed a leak after two days.  It turns 
out they hadn't pressure tested the one I bought (they said they always 
write the results of the test on the cooler w/ a grease pen &amp; mine had no 
writing).  They gave me a new used one that had been pressure tested and I 
haven't had a problem with it for over a year.

The biggest problem for me was that you practally have to take the engine 
out to change an oil cooler on my 82 Vanagon.  Could be easier on a 74 and 
thus less of a pain should you get a lemon.

&gt;
&gt;How risky would it be to buy a used oil cooler from a vendor to use on my
&gt;74, 1800?
&gt;
&gt;The price looks good, but I dont want to take any chances if it is not a
&gt;good idea.
&gt;
&gt;thoughts?
