Subject: [T2] Update I killed my DC engine

Well I pulled the engine and popped the valvecovers and turned the engine
over several times so I could watch the valve train and it looked fine. I
tried to do a compression test and only got 75 psi in #4 and no other
readings. #4 was the only spark plug which had sooty deposits on it? I think
I'll check the valve clearances and try another compression check.
