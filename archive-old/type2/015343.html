&gt;&gt;Guess you would have to pull the tank and shake the crud out, IF YOU HAVE 
&gt;&gt;ANY crud.  (Your question was 'How can I find if I have any crud' or 
&gt;&gt;similar, and my opinion is that you CANNOT find if you have any crud
without 
&gt;&gt;looking, which probably means pulling the tank.

That's called, &quot;Verification by empirative evidence&quot; and is very DM.

You can buy kerosene at over $30 per gallon in the form of 8 oz., $1.95
FLAPS fuel additives if you want. Which method is more likely to get the
desired results???? 

Just recognition of a Swell comment by a Swell Guy from a Swell browed
Neanderthal engineering tech with 45 years hands on experience since he
took apart the windup alarm clock on the kitchen floor before he started
school. Dad wasn't happy cause that windup Westclock cost 4 hours of his
1955 wages to replace. Dad was happy with my curiosity about what I did not
know, he just made sure all the mechanicals were put on the higher shelves
until I could reach far enough for the next experiment.
