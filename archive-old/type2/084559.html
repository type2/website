&gt;THE QUESTION
&gt;
&gt;What exactly (using specific product names) should I do to the bare
&gt;metal spots and pitted rust areas, keeping in mind that it could be
&gt;another week or so before I can get the rig to a painter?

Use a heavy wire brush to loosen rust scale. Give it a wash of Ospho to 
convert the rust to a hard, black base. Light brush after it's dry to 
remove any powder that forms. Then seal it with a primer/sealer. Then build 
up a few layers of sanding primer, dry and sand smooth and recoat and sand 
as necessary to get the level of finish you want. Then take it in for the 
finish prep and paint. Be sure you verify with your finish painter the 
brand and type of primer you use to insure it is compatible with the finish 
paint.

Note that problems can occur when trying to overcoat original paint or 
primer no matter how you prep it. If you don't remove all the original 
paint, there could be problems in a very few years. The old paint and new 
paint will expand and contract at different rates and whole sheets of paint 
can just fall off.

That's all just rule of thumb. Follow your journeyman painters advice as to 
all materials and procedures.
