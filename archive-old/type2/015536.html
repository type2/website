Engine maintenance inspection required.

1. compression balance
2. ingition energy measure or strong snap at the gap and timing verified
3. verify no vacuum leaks
4. check and adjust CO with a proper guage, unless this one has an OXY
which you can monitor with       a VOM. Just turning screws by guess and by
golly results 90% of the time in no solution or    worse problems.

Follow Bentley procedures in all cases. If you don't have the tools, buy
them or hire someone who has them and experience with Bosch KE Jetronic
systems.

&gt;The bus has just over 1500 miles on a rebuild. Until recently cold start
&gt;worked just fine. First starts would crank right up and idle. The first stop
&gt;sign would result in a stall however. This was not too anoying because the
&gt;next stop would usually be Ok and idle would be fine there after. What was
&gt;wierd however was that subsequent starts would have idle difficulties again
&gt;until I drove a little and then no problem.
&gt;Recently I loaned the bus to my brother and he took it to the mountains.
&gt;Upon return, cold start is not working, and idle only works after driving a
&gt;bit - 2nd - 4th stop on a trip. I have checked timing, electrical
&gt;connections, cold start connection ( I will check this again) all fine. I
&gt;also attempted to adjust idle and fuel air screws to the best I could. Any
&gt;suggestions would be appreciated
