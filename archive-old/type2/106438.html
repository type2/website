Subject: aftermarket tires

Must ALSO consider:

1 - the custom wheel's designed weight load, per wheel.

2 - offset, yes, and also the fit to the rear drum (two exposed bolt heads 
are exposed back)

3 - the need for new, longer studs to accomodate the increased thickness of 
the alloy wheels

4 - size of the custom wheels' stud holes (12mm or 14mm) and center hole

5 - proper nuts for the shoulders of the custom wheels' stud holes


From someone who cares a lot, but doesn't know enough
