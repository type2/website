Subject: RE: [T2] More Tire FART Goodness! (Vredestein vs Nokian)

&gt; I took a look at the tires but I have to
&gt; wonder if the shipping doesn't kill you?


It's not dirt cheap, but it's not as bad as you might think. Tires are big,
but are not all that heavy for their size. Every carrier has a different
threshold for what the post office aptly calls a &quot;balloon&quot; rate; a higher
shipping fee for packages that are very large for their weight, because
you're mostly shipping air. (If you haven't noticed, a tire has a big hole
in the middle. :-)  I investigated every carrier and eventually figured out
that Bus tires generally squeak by just under that surcharge if we use FedEx
Ground and bundle them in pairs. Now we have a special FedEx pickup for
tires each day. The shipping cost went down about 30% versus other carriers.
