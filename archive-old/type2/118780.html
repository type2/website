Subject: Re: the craziest off-road trip you've taken in your bus

Well were does one start.
I suppose the best (worst?) was a trip Jan last year. Over 600 miles in 110F
heat on moderate to bad dirt roads. The start of the journey had warning
signs of entering remote area's and to plan accordingly. It was a day's
drive and we never saw another vehicle the whole trip.
As for off road ability I have had my stock '77 2L (except for 215/75R15
tyres) on the beach, muddy goat tracks and creek crossing with water up to
the floor, all without worry.
They have great off road ability, just get to know your van and it's
limitations!!
Funny thing, with all the off road work I have done, the one time I got
bogged was on an entrance to a driveway. That's what you get for being over
confident and not planning how to attack the obstacle.

&gt;So, I was curious what the craziest off-road trail is that people have
&gt;taken their bus on.  We're talking the standard loaf, 79 and down, 2wd,
no syncros ;)

Got pix to show?  Let's see 'em!

Can buses get through sand or do they just sink?  Can they handle
football sized rockbeds?  I guess a bunch depends on the tires, huh?
There's a camping trip coming up and I'm curious as to what my 78 can
endure.

later,
Mike
