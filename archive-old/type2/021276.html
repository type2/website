David, Eron:
My 78 had VPC air installed by me in 84(?) I never slowed down! I could feel the
compressor kicking in, but it wasn't much of a load. It's not quite like on an
American car where the condenser is in front of the radiator. The condensers (2)
are under the front by the front axle and under the driver's side rocker on the
VPC.
So, running the A/C should not increase the operating temperature in any way,
only thing it would do is reduce the amount of power the engine had to propel the
vehicle.
Some company even offered add on air for 71's! I've always felt that an auxiliary
full throttle switch like FI uses might be a good idea- to cut off the compressor
when you need full power.
Still, on my 87 Vanagon, I've towed trailers and even other cars over the
mountains, and when I really needed the power, it's pretty damned easy to reach
up and shut off the A/C selector switch, which immediately releases the clutch on
the compressor drive. Certainly quicker and easier  than downshifting, and it's
only till you crest the hill!

&gt; Running with A/C will just remove 1-5hp from your engine.  If you drive a
&gt; little slower than you would otherwise to compensate, you won't kill your
&gt; engine any faster!  A/C killing aircooled engines is a myth perpetuated by
&gt; people who think they can still put the pedal to the metal with the air on
&gt; high.
