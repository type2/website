&gt; Got my new poptop seal; from Bus Depot. Question: The seal that was on
&gt; previously was short - only went across the back of the poptop. The new

&gt; poptop. Which is right for the '73 Westy?

Hmm.  73 has the luggage rack at the rear, and just a cot upstairs, right?

Ok.  the original seal was a one piece unit, covered the &quot;rear&quot; part,
where it meets the luggage rack, as well as going completly around the
rest of the top.  The aftermarket seals are 2 piece units, one piece is
the piece you have.

Call ron, have him send you the 15 dollarish rear section, he knows what
your talking about.:)   Now...to install!

The long piece goes from one rear corner where it connects to the seal you
have on there...(i'm presuming the rest of your seal is long gone..) all
the way around to the other corner.  Got it?

Ok.:o  Install that seal last.  ~24 hours after you install the other
piece.  What?  The flat piece you have is in great shape?  fine.  go ahead
and put this other part on, then!:)

First off, to install the new flat piece.   Its a PITA.

you're going to need some clamps of some sort, large spring clamps are
good for this.  The seal needs to be glued on.  So go get a tube of
construction black silicon, and a caulking gun.  Pull the old seal off,
clean clean clean.:)

Pop the top, and stand on the luggage rack, if you can.  May be able to
work off of ladders.  Or if you have some scaffolding you can back the bus
under.......:)

Clean the &quot;groove&quot; on the rear seal piece, and let it all dry good.

Now, run a decent bead of silicone down this groove, one end to the other.
Be careful, and try to keep clean.....yeah right.:)

Oh. first.  Make a nice straight and smooth cut on one end of the seal,
that will be your starting edge.   

now, line this edge up with the edge of the top.  Outer edge, same edge
the other seal sits on......got it?  You want this to run from one outside
edge to the other.

Slip it on, be wared, silicone makes things SLICK!  Slide it on, and clamp
it on whichever way you can get it to stay.  Practice lots before you
apply silicone.

Got it on good and even?  Leave the excess hanging off the other edge
until its good and dry.  Clean your mess. (carefully, of course...)


A good day later....smoothly cut off the hanging end of the seal, flush
with the top.

Now to install the long seal.  It has a &quot;bulb&quot; side.  that goes &quot;in&quot;
towards the canvas.  Cut a good clean end on one end, note that it
contains aluminum clips, so use something apropriate to cut it.

Oh.  remove all remnants of the old seal, and clean.  No gluing this time,
just another trick.


Press the seal onto the fiberglass edge, to start.  Now work a few inches
towards the front.  From now on, all the way around, you need to
&quot;compress&quot; this seal.  Dont &quot;stretch&quot; it, particularly around corners,
where your instict is to pull.  dont.  Push it back into itself, towards
the end.

why?  In a few weeks/days/years, as heat hits the rubber, and it begins to
shrink, if it is stretched, it will become smaller, and over all shorter,
and give you a gap at the ends!  if it is compressed, it wont do it near
as much, it will still shrink, but since your overall length is longer,
wont be obvious.

Work like this all the way around the top, till you reach the last 4-6
inches.  Mark about where you need to cut the seal, and give an extra
inch.

Put that end on, and work the sag out of the seal.  May need to pull the
seal back off a little farther up and compress more, but you WANT the
extra inch.


A variation on this would be to put the long seal on first, all the way to
the corners, instead of flush with the rear seal.  I think that this way
looks better, but do it whichever way you prefer.


just my experiances....(learned about compressing that sort of seal doing
sunroof seals.  Stretch one of those, you'll have a nice fat gap in a
week...)

later....david
