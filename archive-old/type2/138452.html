Subject: Re: [T2] Cylinder Head Paint

&quot;Actually, Fisher recommends two other approaches than paint. One I
previously mentioned was black anodizing. &quot;


Anodizing = To coat (a metallic surface) electrolytically with a protective 
or decorative oxide

Man, if you have a rich pitina of rust on the cylinder heads, all you have 
to so is spray the cylinder heads (outsides, fin area) with phosphoric acid.

This will 'coat the metalic surface . . . with a protective or decorative 
oxide' of [[ does anybody know the answer?? ]]

Just do not get the phosphoric acid on any aluminum, please!

And remember to wash the phosphoric acid spray off the cylinders right after 
you have waited an appropriate 10-15 minutes.  Blow dry, or let the sun do 
the work.  Look at the results 1 hour later.  Now, aren't you satisfied with 
yourself.

This process also works great on rusty road wheels, after you sanded as much 
rust off as humanly possible (5 minutes per wheel).  Makes for a great base 
for painting the Krylon colors.
