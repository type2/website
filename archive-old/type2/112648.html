Subject: Re: [T2] Oil pressure light remains on

&gt;There's a long version to this story (read further down).
&gt;
&gt;The short version is that when I turn the ignition key ('82 Vanagon
&gt;with 2L air-cooled), the oil pressure light comes on bright. Then it
&gt;dims but does not shut off.
&gt;  
&gt;
Did the mechanic wash or steam clean the engine? I recently had a 
similar problem on my newly acquired Vanagon. Gave the engine a good 
scrubbing to get who knows how many years of oil and Arizona baby powder 
dirt off. During the scrub I noted there was no rubber grommet for the 
oil pressure sender. After the scrub I started the engine and all seemed 
well. Turn key oil light comes on, Start engine, Light goes out. The 
next day, Turn key, Light comes on. Start engine Light flickers then 
stays on dim. I started to sweat and the temp outside was maybe 37 F. No 
Lifter noise, Good Sign! Shut the engine off and changed pressure sender 
out with a known good unit that came off my 75. Turned key, Light on. 
Start engine, Light off.

Installed threaded end of bad sensor in drill chuck. Pressed a file on 
the crimped metal part of the sensor that holds the plastic part on and 
ground off the crimp. After opening the sensor I discovered moisture and 
corrosion on the contact inside. I believe this was an after market sensor.

I have seen on oil pressure sender do its' job correctly on a too tired 
type 1 engine with truly low oil pressure. Believe me there is no dim 
indication for kinda low pressure, only off and arrrrrg. oops I mean on. 
I would try a new genuine v dubya sender.
Hope this helps.
Tom
