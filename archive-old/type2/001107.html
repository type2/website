I would imagine it might be as simple as the canvas getting in between the
arms.Watch how your canvas lays as you close the top and make sure its not
between the arms. Failing that perhaps the drain stack is sitting up too
high, although if the clamshell piece is there it shouldnt be a problem.
When putting it up, you'll probably have to reach over with one hand and
push the arm to its full upright position and then do the same with the
other side.
