Subject: value of NOS splitty emblem?

Anyone have any thoughts on what the value of a NOS (still 
in the plastic bag  w/ old german sticker/part number on it) 
&quot;VW&quot; front emblem is worth. It is in primer. I looked in the 
RMMW catalouge and they sell repro emblems in primer for 
$69.95 US.

Does anyone know if the repro emblems are the _exact_ same 
as the originals?
