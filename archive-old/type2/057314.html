Subject: Bob Hoover

I have read the list for several years and enjoy the wisdom and spirit of  helping your fellow man/woman out in times of VW need.  Bob Hoover's sermons were one of the best sources of information to the list.  Any method of making the wisdom of St. Hoover available to the list while protecting Bob from the rage of idiots would be greatly appricated.   To lose such wisdom is not an acceptable outcome.  Let us find a way to protect Bob while enjoying the enlighting sermons.
