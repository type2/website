I've worked on 73 Westys that were not built from a sunroof body as the 71's were.  The wood panels appear to be the same.  The cot is different.

&gt;Gurus, Correct me if I am wrong, but I am pretty (very) sure that the 69-73
&gt;Westies were built from sunroof models, so the roof and ceiling should are
&gt;exaclty the same.
