&gt; Quick question for all about the tire pressure. If the placard in the bus
&gt; wants 40psi and the tires are only rated for 35psi max, do I only inflate to
&gt; the 35psi or should I go ahead and inflate to 40psi?

You have passenger tires on your bus.  You should change them to
reinforced tires
with at least a 1540 pound load rating.  These tires will be strong enough
to take the added pressure.

Don't risk those passenger tires on the highway, expecially in the summer
heat.  learn from my mistake!
