A friend of mine has a Falmouth Cutter 22 sailboat with a
fiberglass hull.  On the inside, the cabin areas have thin
cork glued to the hull.  This keeps the hull from 'sweating'
on the inside.

Some late model pop-tops have a velour or fuzzy covering on
the inside.  If it gets wet and stays wet, it mildews.
I wonder if cork would keep the inside of a VW pop-top dry?

I can't tell if my May'73 pop-top roof is the same as the
sunroof station wagon model or not.  My headliner has never
been out and I have not seen a '73 sunroof up close.
