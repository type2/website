Subject: Weber Weirdness

Hi Everybody!

My '78 Westy has a '73 1.7 L running a single barreled Weber that the PO
installed. It looks like a 32DFEV although I'm certain. The choke was not
working so I pulled the electric choke off and cleaned the brass shaft that
was impeding the operation of the choke. The one behind the arm that goes
into the choke spring, flat on one side round on the side away from the arm.
Well now the choke works but the bus won't start, apparently I have angered
the gods. How do I appease them?
