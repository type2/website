&gt; Can I install a BN4 heater in my 73 bus so that it connects to the main
&gt; heater pipe under the bus and not use the stock heat exchangers?  I want to
&gt; have heat and defrost up front, is this possible?

I have a BA4 under the front of my van, have removed all of the heat
system behind the front axle, duct the heat into the heat duct above the
front beam.

not only is it possible, it works nicely

&gt; Also, how much for a fuel pump for this BN4?

don't know much about weather the pumps are the same, BUT you cannot use
an engine fuel pump, they are different designs
