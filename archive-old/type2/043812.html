Subject: [T2] News of the lorax engine removal

-- Hello,
We, yes WE removed the engine from my 1980 van on saturday.
it was so cool, when i got the new engine last year i didnt have much of
a part in getting it in or out for that matter
but saturday i got pretty personal with the old lorax.
We found burnt crusty valves mostly white and gritty, we got some
grinding compound and cleaned the one side all up pretty. then when we
got a look at the other side we found a dropped valve seat and opted to
just send them both out to get machined and cleaned. I had a groove one
one of the cylanders,too. I think it's a real good thing Eric is
schooling me on this whole thing. I just feel like all the things i've
heard on the list is now coming together with what eric is showing me.
It's great. surprisingly I'm not bummed about not having things go my
way.
it will all be better soon and I will definately be at the October bus
fest.
thanx alot.....
