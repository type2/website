Subject: Re: Heat (Electric Fan in Engine Compartment)

+AD4-this fan is a booster for the heating system only.  It functions to move
+AD4-air into the heater boxes when the engine is idling and not moving much
+AD4-air with its own fan.

I used to think this was so, but in fact I do seem to get a noticeable
improvement and faster warming with the electric fan on. I met somebody who
had managed to link two fans up so one blew down each side of the engine. He
used one outlet on each fan and blocked off the other side and got really
good heat.

Note that for the blower to work at its best you've also got to make sure
that you've got the small flaps between the fan and the heat exchanger or
else like in the fan, the air will blow back in the wrong direction when the
engine is at low revs.
