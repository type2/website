Subject: Re: [T2] What kind of oil is best to use on a Westy?

&gt;Hey bus folks,  I ws just wondering what type of oil would be best for my 70 
&gt;Westy.  I use it only in the summer and some freeway driving.    Just 
&gt;wondering...  thanks!
&gt;Cleveland Ohio
&gt;1970 Westy.

Tim, I'm in WV at about the same lattitude.  My personal recc is to go
by the VW book (but a later book including modern oils.)

Basically for us in the summer this means, straight SAE40, 20W50,
or 15W40 (that's DIESEL weight note the 15).  NEVER 10W anything
in an air cooled VW if you want to keep it over 50k miles.

I personally run Castrol 20W50 in the summer, but a good staight 40
weight is a great choice as well.  The 20W50 stretches into spring and
fall around us as well but I tend to run the 15W40 in the winter, usually
a good Shell or Mobil formualtion.  Straight 30 weight can also be used
in the winter with adequate warmup.

Run good oil, blow the extra $0.50 a quart.  Synthetics are worthless
in your type 1 engine unless you have a sand seal and full flow filtration
so don't waste the money.  Personally I tend to use Valvoline, Castrol,
or Shell oils.  Avoid Quaker Sh_at_t at all costs as most sensible people
will tell you.  I'd do oil changes and filter screen changes every 1500-3000
in a type 1 engine and check valve adjustement at the same time.

And blow the $40 or so it will take to install an oil temperature gage, that
combined with a proper functioning thermostat system is the best possible
indicator you are using the correct oil.  You want to make sure your temps
on the freeway stay in the 200-220F range.  Some might say lower, even
down to 180F but to keep the water out of the oil, right around 195-200 is
probably optimal and occasional forrays up to 220F on extremely long
grades won't hurt.  This assumes the sender is installed in a location where
it is correctly in the active oil stream.
