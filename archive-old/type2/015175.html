List,

Did an emissions test on my not-so-recently tuned '78 Cali. Westy.  She
passed the hydrocarbon (HC) portion just fine but bombed on the carbon
monoxide (CO) part.  It passed fine last year with new plugs, filter,
oil, oil filter, etc.  Any comments or suggestions on where to tweak
would be most appreciated (I get a free test within 10 days of flunking
the first!).  Here's the data:

TEST	  	Idle		2500 RPM  	LIMITS		RESULTS

HC PPM	237		148		400		Pass (both)
CO%		4.57		5.90		3.00		Fail (both)
CO2%		10.5		11.0		N/A		N/A (measure only)
RPM		1200 rpm	2340 rpm	1300/2500	----------------


The mechanic suggested new plugs and making sure the engine was fully
warmed up.  He said sometimes driving an air-cooled hard for 30 or more
minutes before the test really helps, especially the HC part of the
test. Again, any comments or suggestions would be appreciated.


The other thing no one can seem to shed light on is the M-Code #764.
Anybody out there know what this one means?? Both the factory and
the estute Vincent Molenaar are stumped. . .

TIA,
Craig in CO
'78 Westies

PS  This Westy lives and breathes (and gets e-tested) at 8,000 feet!!
