Subject: Re: [T2] Amazing engine


&gt; What is interesting to me is the shot of the interior....this bus appears
&gt; to be a Champagne edition, but after blowing up the interior shot, the
&gt; upholstery on the back seats does not appear to have the cloth inserts!
&gt;
&gt; I went out and looked at the original dealer brochure on this site
&gt; http://www.72camper_dot_com/champagn.htm
&gt;
&gt; and the inserts appear to be there, but they are not the gray/brown that I
&gt; have.
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone out there with a 78 champagne edition set me straight on this?
&gt;
&gt; Did they just make them different? or what....mine has a 3/78 production
&gt; date.  They say the pic is from 10/97....may be just different production
&gt; date changes?

Grey is wrong. All 78/79 Champagne buses have the same interior. Red/brown
vinyl with a golden yellow insert. I have the same brochure and the bus
interior pics leave a little to be desired....
I will attach a better interior pic via pmail.
If anyone else wants it, pmail me.
