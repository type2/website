&gt;This weekend, I plan, I my grand scheme for putting my bus back

&gt;I fortunately have the original mats from the front of the bus, and have
&gt;cut out the board for the back - these I can use as templates for the
&gt;carpetting...my only concern here is whether the carpets will need to be
&gt;bound at the edges or not....I figure they shouldn't fray given that
&gt;they have rubber backs.

I don't know what kind of carpet you want to use, but here's my $0.02:

At Home Despot, I bought some thin indoor/outdoor type carpet that
DOESN'T FRAY when cut.  The back doesn't look like the back of regular
carpet, with the regular row/column cross-weave.  Instead, it looks like
someone just took tangles of string and pressed them down into some glue.
I can't describe it any better than that, but that's what it looks like.
And, it doesn't fray.  And it's cheap.  And it's sold in the 6' width
instead of the regular 12' stock most carpet is sold in.

So if you're not looking for plush shag carpet or a Berber wool loop
or something, I would recommend this type of carpet.  I've been using
it as a door mat inside our front door for the last 3 months or so,
and it's wearing quite well.

One drawback, it's only available in a few of the neutral colors
(black, grey, beige I think--maybe blue also).  If you want the brand
name/manufacturer, I'll try to remember to look if/when I'm at Home
Depot this weekend...

Later,
Rodney
