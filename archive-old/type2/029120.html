Every one that knows me thinks so :~)

But I'm speaking of my engine.

Now that my Tranny is ready to install when my parts arrive I thought I
would get back to the engine.

To Update:
On a trip to the beach the other week my Engine started to Ping under load,
if I knew then, what I know now, I would have adjusted my timing to the bad
gas I must have got, I always run 93 Amoco Gold, and that's what I thought I
put in that day, must have been mixed. Like a idiot I kept driving until the
engine got so hot it stated loosing power, so I finally stopped, however the
damage was done, I now had a leak after I let the engine cool completely,
and since it wouldn't idle I the adjusted my timing and drove another 320
miles before we made it home.

I felt this might be above my mechanical skills so I asked the local
mechanic to come take a look, sure enough the compression on the 3 and 4
head was bellow 100 and a chirp could be heard as the engine turned over. He
told me to drop the engine and we would work on it when he got a chance.

One of the reasons I got into VW's was because I could actually work on one
and make it RUN, a good feeling for a old Southern Red Neck! However I don't
know every thing and still seek advice!

Being impatient I started reading the archives to find out about doing a
leak down test.

So I bought my self a leak tester and found that I have a leak between the
Head and the top of the Piston.

I pulled the rocker arms off and found my lower bolts to be Super Loose, The
top ones where still close to torque spec, torque every bolt to spec and did
another test, this time the leak had decreased significantly but was still
there :-(
Also two of the bolts would &quot;snap&quot; as I torqued them, does this mean the
stud is turning in the case?

Now where I could use some help since I have never BTDT.

1. What do I need to do to make my head seal back around my piston?

Thank you for your time and help if you can respond, I would love to be able
to fix this my self so I can say, BTDT!

Meredith
