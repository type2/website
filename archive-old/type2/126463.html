Subject: Re: [T2] Heat Exchanger Question.

When I pulled mine off, I cut up some sheet aluminum and siliconed the
pieces to cover the heater holes in the tinwork. But there's heater
pipes that go from the other end of the HE's that you'll need to block
off as well.

I haven't had a problem since my pipes are all well sealed, so when I
turn off the heater from the levers at the front, nothing comes
through.

&gt; I think my heat exchangers are toast. I'm getting exhaust up through my air
&gt; vents. I took the accordian tubes off of them to keep the exhaust from coming
&gt; up. Well, they almost fell off they were so rusty. :)
&gt; 
&gt; Is their anything else I need to do? Heating the bus right now is SOOoooo low
&gt; on my list of prioritys. Should I block off the outlets or anything?
