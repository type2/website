Subject: Re: [T2] Trailer Lights

Quoting James Jackson &lt;firesong4ng_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;:
&gt; Can I use a standard 4 wire trailer kit?

Nope. You need an adapter to integrate the amber turn signals with the brake
lights. Canadian Tiren and Napa both carry these for around $20.


&gt; Anything funny I need to think about while
&gt; wiring it up?

Nope. Unless you want to consider creating a trailer with amber turn 
signals. I
did that with the westrailer. The voltage for the amber lights is supplied
using a 2-terminal connector in addition to the standard 4-wire setup.

&gt; Wheres the easiest point to tap into the
&gt; wiring.. at one of the rear lights?

That's how I did it.

Happy Trails,
