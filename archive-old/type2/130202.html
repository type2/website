Subject: Battery won't hold a charge

Hi Blake,
           Before you lay out big bucks for gen/alt replacement, how old is 
your battery?  You can get a new one for less than $50, maybe less than $40, at 
the mass merchandisers.  If your battery is 4+ years old, a new one is cheap 
preventive maintenance.

You may be able with a flashlight and mirror to look in the opening in your 
generator to see the top brush.  If the brush is grossly worn, all you may need 
is a new set of brushes [though to install them it's best to pull the 
generator].  

I agree with the other List member who said you probably ran the battery down, 
and did not give it sufficient recharging.  You could think of removing it, 
checking the electrolyte, putting it on a charger..... etc.  Then cleaning the 
terminals and posts for a nice re-install.

Good luck...... Glenn

Hi all,

The other day I went to start my '70 bus and noticed I had left the 
lights on and drained the battery. I got the bus started by jumping it. 
I drove it around for 20 minutes went to the gas station to top off the 
tank and when I went to restart it it was dead. I again jumped the 
battery to get it started and drove it back home. As soon as I turned 
it off, I tried to start it again to see if I built up a charge and it 
was completely dead. So I pulled out Muir's Guide and I think its the 
generator, but since this is my first foray into fixing my bus I wanted 
to throw it out to the list and see what else it could be. If it is the 
generator, I was looking for prices at MidAmerica Motor Works and 
Wolfsburgwest and noticed a conversion to alternator kit. Is there much 
of a benefit to doing something like that?
