Driving off from the church in a bus would be
great...if the new wife is into that of course:)  
when my wife and i got married (before i had the bus) 
we left the wedding in our lifted jeep cj with a
couple others following behind.   we got a lot of
looks, especially since she was driving...in her
wedding dress.   anyways, congratulations!!!!!

&gt; Congrats there bro.  I wonder if he's going to the
&gt; honeymoon in his bus (with cans attached)?
