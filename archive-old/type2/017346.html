Subject: Type I and IV motors and busses...

There has been some discussion about putting type 1 motors in later
busses, and having owned both types of busses (a 74, a 72 with a 1800cc
motor, a 70 with a 1600 SP and currently a 72 with a 1700) I have to add
my opinions here.

With the type I motor in a bus, you have got to remember at all times
that your driving a bug that now weighs 2000lbs,and  has dramaticaly
increased wind resistance. Driving the 1970 cross-country, I had to be
really careful when the temprature got over 90 or the grade more than
5%. also  35mph uphill on the highways in Montana is ALOT slower then
the other traffic (the only vehicle I  passed in Montana said &quot;John
Deere&quot; on the side of it.) use your flashers and be wary in the upper
midwest (hell be cautious in Eastern Oregon) it doesnt matter whos at
fault when your dead.

The 72 on the other hand, can keep up with the flow of traffic (for the
most part) never gets really hot even going to Eugene OR on a 105DF day
loaded with crap at 60MPH. I dont think Id want a type I as a city daily
driver (my 72 is right now). For the most parts my investments in parts
have been in the last 30K miles about the same. Points, two distributers
(for the 72), coil, wirtes, master cylander, front pads etc. The only
chronic problem I havbe is the dual solex's on the 72. So far they have
cost me about 300$ (I had to buy some good used ones, but hell the car
was only 500$ with a new motor), and they are at bes, fair at this
point. This leads me to either buying new/rebuilt twins or exploring
aftermarket progressives (Im not thrilled with the maintance scheduale
on dual carbs). FI is not an option in my case.  So, Im still out on
that one. I realize that if I had a type 1 a hundred bucks later Id have
a new carbs, on the other hand Id still be on my way home from work from
friday too.

A lot depends on the condition of the car. If a car with a &quot;bad year&quot;
rap (IE , my 72) that has had a good owner, its better then a &quot;good
year&quot; car
owned by a cowboy electrician. Thats my .o2s worth. 

I like type IV. cause I like 4th gear too.
