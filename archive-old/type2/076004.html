&gt; &gt; I don't know the size of ring you are speaking about, but I got a BIG
&gt; &gt; set of snap ring pliers from Sears for like $15.  They are MUCH heavier
&gt; 
&gt; Internal or external?  Sears sells a *beautiful* pair of large *external*
&gt; snap ring pliers...  I have 'em, I love 'em, I used mine an hour or so ago
&gt; to take the ring off the CV's.  Alas, I have never seen an equivalent for
&gt; *internal* snap rings.  If you have, *PLEASE* let me know!!!  Especially
&gt; post the Sears part/tool number!!!!

yeah me too, I've broken a few things in there.
