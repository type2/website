Subject: Re: [T2] Pulling Side Windows

Mark,

I just did this to a '79 I had to leave behind in California.

From inside the bus, push on a corner near the frame with even pressure from
the palm of your hand, have a friend outside to pull once enough of the
seal/frame is there to pull safely.

They will pop right out.  My seals were well worth saving.

Billy
Murfreesboro, TN


&gt; My question is, how do I pull the sliding windows out?  Should I just use
&gt; a sharp utility knife and cut the seals?  Or do people use rope/twine
&gt; soaked in soap to pull the seals out like they get installed that way?
&gt;
&gt; Any help woould be most appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; Mark
