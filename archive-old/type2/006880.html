Now, I've got that 1975 Westie with a 1972 412 FI engine in it, and one
cylinder is at 75 psi (the other three are at ~130), which my FLARS
diagnosed as the cause for my illegally high hydrocarbon emissions.  Ian's
note made me think of something crazy -- please tell me how crazy, exactly.
Don't hold back!  (Well, perhaps that illiterate, profane, anonymous listee
could hold back, a little...)

Can I somehow disable the injector on that bum cylinder, and bring my HCOs
into a legal range?  Please note that this would be a temporary expedient,
and I know that I'm due a valve replacement anyway, but would this work?  If
so, how would I go about it?

Thanks in advance!
