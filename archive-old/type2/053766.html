Subject: motor needs attention

Here is my problem.  I put in the the motor with the dog house cooler on it 
but forgot to attatch the vent flat bar.  So no im out of luck right?  
Because it wont get proper cooling.  Heat is not a major factor as the motor 
has installed j pipes anyway.  Does anybody know how to get the flaps to stay 
open permanately?  Its not hard taking out the motor but i really would like 
to not.  Its summer in pa and i need proper cooling!!  

Thanks,
