&gt;David, what do you use as insulation for your under-bus oil temperature
&gt;sender wire?  I've always wondered about that little detail and have never
&gt;seen anything about it here.  &gt;

Travis:
I believe the insulation that David is referring to is the coating on the wire itself.  The most common insulation (coating) is any of a number of vinyl formulations.  It's cheap, flexible (easy to work with), and can be found at any FLAPS, Radio Shack, etc.  The negatives about vinyl wire are that it won't last forever(heat will dry it out and make it crack), it's not very abrasion-resistant,  and will melt off if the wire gets too hot, which effectively limits it's current-carrying capability.  I personally am re-wiring my bus with Teflon-coated wire, which was developed years ago for the Aviation, military, and space industries.  It will outlast my bus.  It's harder to find, but I have a couple of good sources if you're interested.
