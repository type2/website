Ted,

The Y356 is the highway tread and the Y370 is the Mud &amp; Snow rated tire with
a more agressive tread pattern and probably a bit noisier.  When I was
buying tires a month ago, the Y370 was available only in 195/75 R14.  The
Y356 was available in 185 R14 (stock size).  You could put  the wider Y370s
on back and the skinnier Y356s on front.
Good Luck,

&gt;Does anyone know the difference between the Yokohama Y356 and the Y370
tire.
&gt;The local idiot at NTB doesn't ( says one looks better). All of my driving
&gt;is highway, no off-road) so which one is better? Please reply by p-mail and
&gt;I'll let the list know the consensus of opinion. As always, TIA TBear
