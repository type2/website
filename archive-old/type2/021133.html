&gt; Great month up here in the great white north

&gt; Now it looks like I'm to be the new owner of a 77 Riviera. This bus has
&gt; apparently been converted to a single carb, can anyone suggest a better dual
&gt; carb set up. Can the solex'es off the 1700-1800 work on a 2 liter?
&gt; Can Kadrons be mounted on proper manifolds.

Chuck:
Yes, most everywhere but in the US used 32-34PDSIT's clear up into the Vanagon
years. BUT, I think they are WAY more trouble than factory FI, and inferior in
most every way. May have SLIGHTLY different jets, it might say in Haynes
manuals.
