&gt;The sad truth is now I have to decide between a head job, a home rebuild or
&gt;an AVP longblock.  After a quick look on the internet it dosen't look like
&gt;the dollar difference between the three options is that great, so i'm now
&gt;leaning toward the AVP longblock.

The dollar difference is a small consideration in this case. the larger consideration is your growing
relationship with her (the whole bus, including the engine) if you're hoping for a lasting relationship
I'd advise you to pull the motor yourself, get the head off, have it rebuilt or order a new one, then
put it all back together. If you do that, life will be better than good. I wouldn't go for an AVP longblock
if your compression is good in the other cylinders. That would be throwing out the baby with the bathwater.
good luck
