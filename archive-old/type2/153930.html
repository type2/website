Subject: Re: [T2] intake manifold question

The carbs in this ad look a whole lot to me like the original 72 or 73 
carbs, which were of course type 4 intake carbs. In fact I'd be willing to 
bet on it. And it looks like they come with a rebuild kit too and the 
linkage.

Some are for or against the FI setup and there have been about a million 
posts about the Weber carb you can get most anywhere so you can research it, 
but I have used the Weber on 3 different buses over 6 years and never had a 
problem with them, and you can get one NEW as opposed to a used set of carbs 
that are 33 years old. Just my thoughts.

Good luck,

Rob Henley
