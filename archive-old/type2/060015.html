Subject: Shifting Problem (77 bus)

Howdy All --
My friend's 77 bus is giving her some grief, so I thought send out a query
for anyone interested to chew on.  She's having a hard time getting the
gear shift into 1st gear (most always) and 2nd gear (sometimes).  At a dead
stop, she really has difficulty getting it into 1st -- although this
doesn't happen every time, it happens more frequently than not and she says
it feels as if the slot the shifter goes into is too small or something;
I've seen her really have to strain and push hard to get it in there. 
(She's even had to start out from 2nd after not being able to get it into
1st.)  This also sometimes happens -- although less frequently and with
less severity -- when going from 1st to 2nd.  She pointed out that when
this doesn't happen, it just feels like normal shifting; she also said that
there are NO problems whatsover shifting into 3rd and 4th.  Here's a few
other points she made:  (a) The transmission was rebuilt within the past
couple of years, according to the PO; (b) Easing up on the brake pedal
seems to make it easier to get it into 1st -- this didn't add up for me but
I thought I'd include it anyway; (c) There is no grinding when trying to
get it into gear -- it just won't go; and (d) The shifter goes into 1st and
2nd with ease when the engine is turned off.  

Does this sound familiar to anyone -- could it be a minor shift linkage
problem, or is it most likely something a bit more serious?  Of course, if
I have described this incompletely, please let me know and I'll add what I
can.  Thank you for any help you can provide.
