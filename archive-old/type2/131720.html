Subject: RE: [T2] hydraulic valves

&gt;From: &quot;sam&quot; i came to a answer yesterday as i was adjusting my valves. I am 
&gt;going to buy hydraulic valves i was wondering if it is worth it and what do 
&gt;i need to buy to convert my valves over. Any imput from the list would be 
&gt;great. Also if i didn't want to do the work  can my local machinic do the 
&gt;work who usually services my bus also i heard you don't need to pull the 
&gt;engine out of the bus is that true i would like to do it to my 1976 bus 
&gt;which as everybody knows is a 2L engines

Sam,

You need the Hydraulic Cam as well. You do have to take the out to replace 
the cam but the lifters you do not have to pull the engine if replacing them 
with the same type of lifter. Hydraulic old to Hydraulic new, Solid old to 
Solid new.

Shameless plug to fund the &quot;el Verde&quot; resurrection.
