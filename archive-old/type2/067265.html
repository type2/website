The Quest:  A potential Search and Resuce of a undeterminable  bus.

We finally found the &quot;fellow&quot; who owned &quot;The Bus&quot; after stopping and
asking a couple of kids walking home from the school bus.  This was a
much &quot;safer&quot; approach than attempting to contact another &quot;TrailerPerson&quot;
as kids are usually just kids, whereas &quot;TP's&quot; are known to &quot;get edgy&quot; if  you
interrupt their concentration while watching &quot;Oprah&quot;.  As were were close to
Oprah Hour and out of &quot;dog treats&quot; we decided to take our chances with the
bookish crowd and asked a youngster wearing a &quot;Garth Brooks&quot; t-shirt if he
knew a guy who had a buncha V-Dubs at his place.  &quot;Sure he says, right up
the road there past the Smith's place.&quot; &quot;Don't worry&quot; he said, &quot;He ain't got no
dawgs, but watch out fer his horse!&quot;  &quot;Cool&quot; I think, &quot;I've got sugar cubes...&quot;

Not only did this guy have &quot;The Bus&quot;, but upon wandering around his &quot;plot&quot;
we spotted (2) 412's, a dozen or so 60's beetles, (2) early 60's ghias, a
sweet `59 Impala &quot;Duece&quot;, a Greenbriar Corvair (no motor) and a bevy of
indistinguishable mid-70's american muscle-cars.

&quot;The Bus&quot; was parked off to the side of his pasture, on top of a small oak
tree which grew up through the rear bumper between the engine lid and the
rear drivers butt-cheek, which was noticeably absent.

&gt;From a distance (scanning the horizon for horse) &quot;The Bus&quot; looked rougher
than most we'd seen recently. By the time we walked up to it I had almost
decided to pass on it's availability, mentally trying to figure out a way to
politely
back out of the sale. It's roof line was crusty, the rockers were obviously
losing
the fight with gravity, and the doors skins on the drivers side
were...wait!.. the
double doors on the DRIVERS SIDE!

&quot;You alright?&quot; the fellow said. &quot;I musta stepped into a hole&quot; I blurted,
trying to
cover up the sudden weakness in my knees as I realized &quot;The Bus&quot; was a
double door panel.  &quot;Yeah&quot; the fellow said, &quot;It's kinda rough pasture out here..
&quot;Watch out fer horse-shit&quot; he said, &quot;Not that the stuff is dangeruos, but if the
&quot;Horse&quot; smells himself on ya he'll try to hump ya!&quot;  I think he thought I was
worried about &quot;the horse&quot; as I sped/ bolted toward the bus.

In the shadow of &quot;the Bus&quot; I noted it was `prolly a 59 or 60 (turned out to be a
1961) and that the condition was much worse than even I had peeped from
the north end of the South Fourty.

Not near as nice as Bob Hufford's 59 he sold out from under me...;-) but
MUCH closer than Missouri......

Details:

Rockers shot
Rear Drivers Butt-Cheek toast (tho the taillights and lenses were ok)
Roof line was crusty, but predominantly limited to paint peeling
Front dog-legs were strong, but crusty
Nose was nice down to the lower valance (floorpan level) where it had started
        to crumble and flake.
Doors were'nt bad, handles were'nt pitted AND worked
Some rot under the windsheild.

Further inspection devulged:

Wheels rolled ;-)
Lug nuts came off easily as we replaced the pancaked bias-plys with a set
        of radials I pulled of &quot;Lemonhead&quot;
Engine turns over nicely (36hp w/govenor and stock air-filter)
Engine compartment ID tag in place as was the M-Code plate
Two sets of front bench seats, 1 toast, one near new...
Original took kit (plus a couple of tool boxes I haven't peeped out yet)
A few early mechanical Bosch Dizzies (BR8) and a new 36hp crank still in
        it's VW box covered in machinists wax. 
A neat ambulance &quot;style&quot; searchlight mounted in the drivers A-pillar above
        the front windsheild.


All-In-All a complete 61 panel bus. Well used, but not abused as most of the
interior looked free from the normal dings and bumps we usually find with
work vans.

Once we got the bus hooked and by the time we pulled it around facing the
gate, it was dark. We thanked and paid the fellow and said our good byes to him 
after promising to come back next week for a &quot;few more&quot; of his treasures, We
were almost at the gate when &quot;the Horse&quot; strolled up.

I tossed him sugar cubes as we drove past. The smell of horse-poop in the
car was strong.....
