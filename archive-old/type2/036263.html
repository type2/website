Subject: Re: heater control knob in 71 westy

&gt; It seeems to lead to a heat junction under
&gt; the seat, but what part of the heat does it control?

It controls heat flow into a box that &quot;blows&quot; heat to the back seat
passengers.  Look for a 3/4&quot; lip at the bulkhead between the front seats at
the floor, facing towards the back.  This was VW's pitiful attempt at rear
cargo area heat for the Kombi busses, at least the passenger busses had more
vents.

I took the hose off and stopped up the connection.  There was a slight
improvement with defroster output.

Hope this helps
