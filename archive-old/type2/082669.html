&gt; HI EVERYONE! MY NAME IS JACKI. I DONT KNOW A DAMN THING ABOUT CARS, BUT I
&gt; HAVE A 1969 VW BUS AND I PLAN ON RESTORING IT INSIDE AND OUT WITH AS LITTLE
&gt; HELP AS POSSIBLE. DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS ON:
&gt; 1. WHERE IS THE BEST PLACE TO START WHEN RESTORING A BUS?

Absolutely, positively, no doubt, I will defend this to the death:

THE BRAKES!

More important than the body, more important than the engine, more
important than the trans!  A car that will not &quot;go&quot; will not kill you.  A
car that will not stop, on the other hand....

&gt; 2. WHAT BOOKS WILL HELP OUT THE MOST ALONG THE WAY THROUGH THE
&gt; PROJECT?(REPAIR MANUALS, UPHOLSRT,ETC.)

Well,  the Bentley manual is the best of the printed repair manuals.  On
the other hand, there are very few procedures you would care to do that
are not covered in the type2 library at very low cost (free :-) see:
http://www.type2_dot_com/ and click on the library link.

&gt; 3. ANY HELPFUL HINTS ?

Remember that this car was designed to be put together by teenagers :-)
Look at all the VW mechanics who advertise that they &quot;worked at the
factory&quot; or were &quot;trained by VW&quot; and remember that all these buses are
20-50 years old!  Subtract 30 years from the face of that mechanic and you
are looking at a teenager!

Sure, VW had lots of very experienced workers who did a heck of a job, but
to be sure that any worker could be assigned to any task, they had to
design to the lowest common denominator... i.e. your typical 18-year old
boy :-)  And the first time they walked thru the factory gates, the didn't
know a damn thing about fixing or building cars either!
