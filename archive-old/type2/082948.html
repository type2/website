&gt; There was a tear in the Right side outer boot and  rust and water that were present.   I swapped the right
&gt; side assembly after repacking the newer ones and installed them.  Steve was right there were two different bolt
&gt; heads.  Some 6mm Hex and some Torx drive.   A few stripped but luckily, Mr Vice-Grip stepped in when he was needed
&gt; and everything was fine.  One of the easier jobs on the westy.

They were not Torx.  they were triple square.  If you tried a torx driver,
that is probably why they stripped.

I've done a lot of these, and I've yet to strip one, but I tend to be very
picky about cleaning the recess.
