Subject: windshield rust
Content-Disposition: inline

hey everyone...
  I purchased my 1968 Bus back in January. For the most part it is rust free (just a few holes in the cargo floor that the PO drilled and failed to treat) except for the area under my windshield. I understand that this is a common problem for buses. does anyone have any suggestions on how I should go about correcting this offense?

Peace &amp; Harmony
