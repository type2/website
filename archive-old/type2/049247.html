Subject: [T2] Squeeks &amp; Rattles when I Roll

After putting up with rattling and squeeking cabinets in my Westy, I finally
pulled in for a pitstop at the friendly local big box hardware store and
picked up some 1/2 diameter sticky back felt pads.  I think they are called
&quot;furniture protectors&quot;.

A sticky felt here, a sticky felt there.  Generally, I put them two to a
swing out door, on the sides and top of the box the drawer slides into, and
on all four sides of the &quot;portal&quot; behind the sink.  Where ever doors, lids
or drawers can rattle, squeek and bang.

I drove off, and over some railway tracked.  Thunk, thunk.  A nice solid
sound.  All, and I mean ALL noticable cabinet chatter was now gone.  Of
course, its still sounds like a VW, just not like one about to come apart.

Best $2.50 I ever spent on Gretchin.  Just a reminder to those Westy owners
who may be putting off such a simple cheap improvement.  Don't get them too
think, or things won't close when you are done.  The 1/2 round pads worked
perfectly well.
