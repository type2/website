Hello all,
  I posted over the last fw days about a bunch of parts for sale including a
Speedo with trip, bumper,type 4 heads, etc. I got swamped with replies and am
working through them as fast as I can, please bare with me. I am working with a
very slow ISP, and using Yahoo! to boot. I am changing ISP soon, but staying
with the same address. I will be sending out replies to everyone today, but if
you do not hear from me by the end of the day, please write back, your message
may have gotten lost at my old address(scott.solomon_at_mcchord.af_dot_mil) Please
write to me here.
  Now, for those of you that wanted to see the Speedo(now sold) and the Bumper
with the super hitch, I have them up on my web page. Just go to the for sale
page. I also have there a picture of a very strange Mirror. It has a 2-3in
extention in it that I know nothing about, but it looks like a factory Mod. Its
for sale if yuo want it, but I would really love to know why it has be
extended. If you know, please tell me.
  So I thank you all for your patients, I will write you today(my day off).
