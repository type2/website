He said  he had left them out because they were not on there to begin 
with - he  wasn't totally sure if he needed them.  However, he did say 
that  there were no head gaskets and he did put 0.010 shims underneath 
each of  the cylinders.

I'm wondering if the headers are really seating against  the exhaust 
ports.  We'll run it again and do some more  research...

You should be able to either feel or see the exhaust leak at the  headers.. 
wish you guys luck   later  mark  d
