&gt;  you said:
&gt;  'Brake lock up is caused most by unmaintained calipers, then by 
&gt;unmaintained hoses, then by unmaintained master cylinders'....
&gt;  is there  maintenance other than the 'flushing and renewel of fluid 
&gt;periodically' that you mention?? thanks.

As to calipers, just inspection of the boots when replaceing pads. As to
rear wheel cylinders, just inspection of boots when replacing shoes. As to
hoses, visual inspection yearly when flushing the fluid. As to master
cylinder, really nothing else but inspecting for leaks.
