Subject: I need help with 79 2000cc FI computer 

Dear Type2,
 
I have a 79 tranporter with a 2000cc FI engine and I would like to learn
more about the computer and all of its inputs and outputs for
troubleshooting purposes.
 
Do you know anyone or any resource for documentation and knowledge about
how the computer works?
 
My engine is a California type and it is supposed to have a O2 sensor.
It doesn't and I am wondering if the computer expects and O2 input.
 
My engine seems to be burning rich and I think that it is because of the
computer not getting all the right inputs etc..
 
Any help is greatly appreciated.
 
Thank you for your time,
