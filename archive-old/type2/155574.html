Subject: Zinc Additive?

Mark mentioned zinc as an additive in Penzoil, and is required to properly
seat lifters to cams.

And, according to this site: http://skepdic_dot_com/slick50.html

&quot;

*zinc: good for the common cold &amp; your car's engine*

Another type of additive is *zinc dialkyldithiophosphate*. Zinc-d is found
in Mechanics Brand Engine Tune Up, K Mart Super Oil Treatment, and STP
Engine Treatment With XEP2, among others. The touting of zinc-d as a special
ingredient in engine oil additives is a little like the Shell ads which
touted &quot;Platformate.&quot; (Most gasoline has similar additives but under
different names.) Zinc-d is an additive in most, if not all, major oil
brands. The wonder oils just put more of the stuff in a 50 weight engine
oil. It would be useful if your engine were ever operated under extremely
abnormal conditions where metal contacts metal: &quot;the zinc compounds react
with the metal to prevent scuffing, particularly between cylinder bores and
piston rings....unless you plan on spending a couple of hours dragging your
knee at Laguna Seca, adding extra zinc compounds to your oil is usually a
waste.... Also, keep in mind that high zinc content can lead to deposit
formation on your valves, and spark plug fouling&quot; (Rau).

If zinc-d is so good for your engine, why haven't oil manufacturers been
putting more of it in their standard mix of oil and additives? Actually, oil
companies have been *decreasing* the amount of zinc-d because the evidence
indicates that zinc-d causes deterioration of catalytic converters.&quot;
