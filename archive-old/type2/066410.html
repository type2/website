Subject: Re: Double Cab Snorkel?

        Bren,
        Of all the very cool things on your very cool double cab, I
think the snorkel/air intake is THE coolest. The little connector pipe from
the rear-quarter sheetmetal to the under-bed rail had a 26xxxxxxx
part number- Post the number, and people could amaze their parts 
persons by asking for one :) 
        Oh yeah, post the manufacturer's plates too- there must be
an M number for the snorkel option!

         Since I've got all my parts catalogs packed, has anyone got an 
86 or later catalog showing unusual single/double cab parts?

        Thinking about it, I can't remember seeing any air-intakes
for cooling air on the flanks of your double cab- but I DO remember seeing
there was extra boxing-in behind the rear-fenders. Do all 1976s have
vertical sheet-metal behind the rear fenders- is it a later-bubble
feature? I was wondering of there was some sort of air-intake or
air-water-separator... Someone else on the list has a mid-70s
double cab yes?  where does it get its cooling air? 
        Sorry I didn't stay around to help pull the cover back on it-
I'll be a more useful visitor next time!

        Bill
