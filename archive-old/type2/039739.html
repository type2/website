Subject: Cup holder

Volks,

I found a nice cupholder at Wal-Mart that attaches to the dashboard vents.
It is made of black plastic and looks real cool. They attach to the vents in
the dash by either door.

Last I looked, they still had them.

And lets try and stay off the black and white versions of cupholders. I use
cupholders, but am quite responsible with them. I don't drive with my knees.
I have recently been in a head on collision where the other driver came into
my lane, yet I still chance the &quot;dangerous&quot; cupholder.
How can German logic be wrong, some of you might ask? With the possible
exception of WWII, the Germans could be considered logical people. Not on
par with Clingons, but none the less logical. Hell, I'm half German.

I personally believe that if the driver is responsible, a cupholder can be
safe...

Or are Germans the only race whose laws are valid on this list?

Hmmm...

I'll take my chances with a non OEM Whizbang cupholder.

Ok, let me have it!
