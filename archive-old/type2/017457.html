Subject: PDX rebuild info.

Always VDub- I worked on one of there rebuilds and wasnt particularly
thrilled with the lack of attn to detail. The particular car hadnt been
treated well since it had been rebuilt, but still, it was ghe little
things.

I know that Halsey doesnt rebuild motors anymore (they install the
dreaded GEX, but they stand behind them with their own warranty I
believe) but Tom, the mechanic who workks on VWs there is a
starteforward by the numbers kinda guy. Id say take it to him for a
complete tune-up and diagnostic. Hell tell ya the compression what it
means and whetehr the bus is worth it (I heard him tell one guy that not
only was his motor toasted, but his front end was shot, and the cost of
the work would be more then the value of the vehicle. His suggestion was
&quot;go out and find  a same year bus with a strong motor, and then youll
have parts forever.&quot;). I like a man who thinks like that. He coulda
milked that guy for a buttload of money, but talked him out of it
instead. He also old me that &quot;your carbs are old, but we got them
adjusted right. Run them into the ground, but start saving for new
ones.&quot;

My opinion.

On end play: If you can see the pulley wheel shaking, its probably too
much.

Max wt on cots: 180lbs (if I recall correctly)
