&gt; okay,
&gt; the other day i was asking about tires.  currently, i have cordovan 
&gt; 185/70R14 on my 1975 Westy thanks to the PO.  so, i bought 4 new 
&gt; tires....Yokohama 185R14 Load Class D.
&gt; 
&gt; well, they arrived (in lightening speed i might add) yesterday.  so, i'm 
&gt; looking at the old tire and the new tire.  the old one (185/70R14) is much 
&gt; wider of a tread than the new ones i just bought (185R14.)
&gt; 
&gt; are these new tires going to fit on my old rims?  the old rims, i believe 
&gt; are original.

Yes they will fit.  The 185R14 is the correct size and D is a good load
range
