Subject: re: splitting Folly's case

Barry's mechanic shattering a socket reminded me of the warning in a tool 
catalogue about chrome vanadium sockets.

The warning was that chrome vanadium sockets were liable to shatter under 
extreme stress - specificaly if used with an impact driver. For use in impact
drivers they sold case hardened sockets which were black not silver.

Sounds like we should consider these when using 'cheeter bars' on tough nuts.

Sorry for wasting your time if you already knew this.


To Barry - have you tried heat?
