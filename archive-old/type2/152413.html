Subject: Re: [T2] CV joints

Bart,

You can train with the old CV. It will have more slack than the new
one and be easier to put back together. Bentley shows how to do it.

If the new one came apart, there is a way to reassemble it, clean it
real well and play with it in front of TV, or in bed :-)

There are 6 balls, and each may need to go in it's own grove. That is
6*5*4*3*2*1 = 720 combinations. Out of these, I'm sure there is more
than one that works.

I have used duct tape to avoid loosing the stuff while greasing. Good luck

-Arnaud


&gt; Any suggestions on how to assemble the CV-joints? I bought some new ones
for
&gt; our '68-bus and while adding grease I unfortunately disassembled them. I
&gt; read the archives about the small and large intersections but the inner
race
&gt; with the balls just doesn't want to fit in the outer race - the balls seem
&gt; to be too tight...
&gt;
&gt; I would aprreciate some tips?
&gt;
&gt; Bart
