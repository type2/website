Subject: Re: [T2] Starting/oil question

If you have hydraulic lifters you will get a few seconds rattle.  The 
pressure light switch is a different matter.  Are you sure it is really 
taking that long.  Mine with the sender i am currently using because of 
its location takes about 1.5 seconds to register.

&gt; My '78 will rattle a bit and the oil pressure light stays on and gauge 
&gt; will
&gt; not register pressure for about 5 seconds when I start it.  You can hear
&gt; things quiet down back there and then the light goes out and the gauge
&gt; registers.  The bus holds good oil pressure once it is running.
&gt; It is getting to where I wince every time I turn the key.
&gt; I am using Mann filters from Bus Depot and Castrol Syntec oil.
&gt; I thought that german OE filters had some sort of pressure valve in 
&gt; them that
&gt; US filters lacked, supposedly to prevent something like this.  Could I 
&gt; have
&gt; gotten a bad batch of filters?  Or is the alleged valve there for some 
&gt; other
&gt; reason?
&gt; Also, what is the best way to add an oil cooler?
