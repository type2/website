Subject: Re: [T2] Best stereo setup???

Not that anyone asked, but...
My rig:
JVC 35wx4 CDplayer/am-fm (with IR remote!) in the original hole (had to hack it a bit-oh well)  with an MTX wedge box containing two 8&quot; full range elements and 2 tweeters behind the Z-bed facing the rear hatch.
Also, two old Sony 4&quot; portable stereo box speakers under/behind driver and passenger seats. 
Nice bass (a little boomy sometimes) and highs from the back with mid/voice coming from under yer a$$.  Still tough to clear the road/wind/engine/tranny noise. System sees most use when bus is at rest. Get all uptight when i can't hear the engine.
Total investment: $90.00

Pawn shops, man. Pawn shops.
