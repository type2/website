We are definitely going to Alaska the end of June and the whole of July. 

Could anyone on our route be of assistance, if we need it?  The beast is
in good shape ('71 bus) but just in case, y'know, it would be nice to
have people we might get help from, or information from about stuff to
see (good things to do with kids) on the way.

Our route will be as follows:

To U.S. Interstate 5 north from Rancho Cucamonga, through California,
Oregon and Washington, to a short Washinton State 539 over the
US-Canadian border to Trans-Canada 1.

Then Trans-Canada 1 to Cache Creek and then 97 through Prince George to
Dawson Creek for Alaska Highway &quot;Mile 0&quot; then Alaska Highway (also known
as 97 and 1) to Tok, Alaska, then on to Fairbanks and Anchorage in
whichever order we feel like. Maybe to the Kenai Peninsula for some
fishing. . . 

And then back home same way, probably.

Thanks all!
