Dear Dave.

Back in 1991, I too modified the circuit of electric heater booster fan (ex 
1976~79 VW 2000 Type 2 - bought from a breaker's yard in South Africa whilst 
on holiday in 1980) I fitted to my 1973 VW '1600' Type 2 Westfalia 
Continental (soon to have a 1911cc VW 17/1800 Type 2 &amp; 4 hybrid engine!). 
However, I chose to use both a VW Type 2, 2-pole manual switch and the 
standard, white nylon spacer (between the heater levers), with earth (i.e. 
ground) contact.

By having both of these connected in series, the fan doesn't get left on by 
mistake, when the heating is not needed and when the heating is in use, you 
have the option of turning off the electric booster fan.

If you no longer want your white nylon spacer with earth contact, I need an 
extra one, so that I can implement the same circuit modification on my pair 
of retro-fitted ventilation booster fans.

Regards.

&gt;I have effected a cunning modification to Sally's heating system that I
&gt;thought I'd share because I've not heard of anyone else doing it.
&gt;It annoys me that it is not obvious whether or not the booster fan is
&gt;running:  Lever almost all the way down = off, lever all the way down = on.
&gt;Also, it would be nice to have max heat all the time and turn the fan on
&gt;and off without messing with the lever.  So I took the wire off the lever
&gt;terminal and connected it to a switch, then connected the other end of the
&gt;switch to ground.  Close switch, fan comes on - easy.  I just have the
&gt;switch dangling under the dash at the moment while I trial the system, but
&gt;it seems to work well.  This mod can be put back to stock at any time with
&gt;no permanent alteration to the wiring.
