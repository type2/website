Dear list,

sorry I was wron about the timing.  The staic light came on when the notch
which is either 5 degrees BTDC or 0 degrees was 12 degree to the left of
zero.  Looking at a diagram in the book i guess this is actually BTDC.  So
if the notch is 5degrees BTDC then my timing would be set at about 7
degrees BTDC.  or 12 BTDC if the notch is at zero.  Sorry for the
confusion.  Anyways what is causing it to run so hot?

TIA
