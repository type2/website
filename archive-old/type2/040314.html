77 WestFalia
Bright Yellow (original paint)
94,000 miles
$5,500 obo

No rot / rust / leaks anywhere. Original paint is in beautiful shape.
Engine (stock FI) runs very strong. Exhaust and heating system is solid through
and through.
Original interior is in excellent shape. No rips/tears/stains in the fabric at
all. Carpeting is in
perfect shape. I just had the front seats re-padded but kept the original
fabric. No
cracks/fading in the dash. New VDO tach,oil temp, CH temp, oil press. In dash CD
player.
All cabinets and molding are in very good shape. FG top and seals are perfect.
Canvas has one little
tear from PO pinching it in the clamp, other then that there's no fading or dry
rot. I have all repair
and service receipts from day of purchase.

This bus is truly beautiful. I'm moving to Colorado shortly and  I can only take
one vehicle. Since I'm
towing a horse trailer the bus is out of the question. I have some pictures but
their not online yet. I'll
post when I have a link to some pictures. If interested email me direct or call
at (603) 895-8431- lv. msg.
