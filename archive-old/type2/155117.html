Subject: Bus Sub Questions - water leak, will a deep cycle run an amp?

I am building a custom subwoofer to fit behind the drivers seat in my '77 Westy, I taped it together to trial fit it and left it in the bus over the long weekend, I pulled it out today and the corner on the bottom, closest to the drivers door, was very wet.

First question - Does anybody have a &quot;9 times out of 10 if your floor is wet right there it is from...&quot; kind of answer for how the water is getting in there?

I have pictures of the sub, I am trying photobucket for the first time, i hope it works http://i142.photobucket_dot_com/albums/r112/Rodewarrior/P1010013.jpg

There will be a grill hiding everything when it is done.

Second question - I am still working out how I will wire the amp, can I run an amp off of a deep cycle battery? It is a little thing, i am not about BOOM, just great listening.

I am thinking that today may be the day to finally order the wiring kit for a second battery and make it part of the project.

I am planning to talk to some people that are smarter than me about the wiring, but I am thinking about some kind of system with a relay so I can turn on an accessory system off of the deep cycle with an inverter, the radio and the sub amp for when I am parked camping.

Thank you
