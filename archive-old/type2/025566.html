&gt; Do regular and high test really have different densities?  Back when I was
&gt; in college we had to use a special motor-driven test engine with variable
&gt; compression and standard fuels to measure octane rating accurately.

*Accurately* is the key, and I know about the octane test engine.

I did a search...the two hydrocarbons in the &quot;reference gasoline&quot; are
isooctane and normal heptane.

Octane--57.3 lbs/cu. ft.
Heptane--42.42 lbs/cu. ft.

A hydrometer and a trained operator would be able to decide whether to take
the gas back to Raleigh for further analysis. It's kinda like those little
dipsticks we used to use to screen urine for drugs--if it turns color, send
it to the test lab.
