LISTEN TO YOUR WIFE!!!!

I've been married long enough to know that life is always more pleasant if
you listen to your wife......


&gt; No, the decision has been made. I still feel the same way after
&gt; sleeping on it. I have 3 cars I can jump into and go without worrying.
&gt; They don't take the time this bus does. Maybe if I had one that was
&gt; perfect to start with it wouldn't be so bad, but this bus has me
&gt; feeling like I'm chasing shadows.

there is no such thing as the perfect bus,...except the one you have
worked on for years, like the one you have.  I think everyone here could
match you sob story, it isn't perfect like a woman they have their good
days and thier bad days, totally a mystery, as soon as you think you have
it figured out.  but in the long run their both worth it (women, make that
men)

&gt; I don't want to leave this community forever! Just until I can fit
&gt; another high-maintenance woman into my life. ;-)

you won't live that long,  LOL


your choice you call your life
but wait at least a week, month might be better see if you still feel that
way, cover it with a tarp for a month and see if you aren't out there
loooking under the trap before the month is over.  (dang things are worse
than drugs)
