Subject: Re: Missing Studs?

&gt;Hello All,
&gt;
&gt;I noticed the other day a stud was missing on my exhaust port manifold as  
&gt;well (another list member noted the same thing on his engine) , I was  
&gt;told by the PO that the heads were installed by a pro - can these studs  
&gt;fall out by themselves?
&gt;

Well, it's possible, but that speaks to the quality of work they did. It
only takes a little locktite to make sure they don't fall out. 

If it fell off, get another and put it in.._dot_using locktite. Make sure you
use the right torque specs for tightening. More likely, it's broken off and
you'll want to use an easy-out or some other method to extract it...though
you'll probably want to remove the exhaust for this procedure. I've seen
other folks drive with broken studs and have also been guilty of it myself.
I believe there's power loss potential, though...and for some reason, I'm
thinking cooling problems can arise if the gap between exhaust and head gets
wide enough to notice.

Have fun! Joe
