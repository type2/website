&gt;
&gt;So why don't water-cooled cars use electric pumps?  My guess is cost, and
&gt;that they think it's not enough hp for the average consumer to worry about.


Just for comparison, my 360 gph pump uses less than 2 amps at 12v.  I would
have some hesitation in using only an electric pump given that a failure may
result in a fried engine, and one wouldn't have the usual knocking and
clunking that announces a mechanical pump's failure.  In the case of the air
cooled engine, however, the main cooling system would not be disabled, so
the consequence of failure would be survivable.

Regards,

Grant
