Subject: Little dizzy springy thingy

Been having trouble getting a 1600 DP engine started,
it cranks and cranks and occasionally tries to fire
but won't go. I seem to have spark and gas, have not
checked compression yet.  I put a new distributor in
today and when I took out the old dizzy, i saw that
ther was NO little spring down there underneath the
dizzy (down in the hole between bottom of the dizzy 
the distributor drive gear.
SO, would the ABSENCE of that spring cause an engine
not to start???
