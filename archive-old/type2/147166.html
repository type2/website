Subject: engine carrier bar for 1600cc in a late bay.

I'm &quot;tossing&quot; a 1600cc in my '74 bus temporarily until I get the type 4 
motor fixed. The motor is a '67 type 3 (TO).

Can I use a stock late bay engine carrier bar to mount the 1600cc engine 
or do I need to get the '68-'71 bar? Can the later one be modified to 
fit? What do I need to make this happen?

Is this carrier bar completely necessary? The bus isn't going to see 
much action with this setup... Probably no road time at all... just need 
to be able to move it around the driveway.

thanks
Eddie
