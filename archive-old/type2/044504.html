&gt; &gt; &gt;You can convert the stock 2.0-liter '77 Type IV engine to hydraulic
&gt; &gt; &gt;lifters (no more valve adjustments) fairly easily. When rebuilding the
&gt; &gt; &gt;stock '77 engine, replace the cam, lifters and pushrods with the
'78-'83
&gt; &gt; &gt;hydraulic versions of these. Voila! Instant hydraulic-liftered Type IV
&gt; &gt; &gt;2.0-liter engine.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Can this be done to my 1700 motor?

 &gt; Absolutely.  There is also a small difference in the rocker arm
assemblies
 &gt; - I can't remember exactly but I believe there is a difference in the
 &gt; spacers on the rocker shaft.  If you have a 78-up parts motor, use the
 &gt; assemblies from it just to be safe.

 If you have a 68-79 Bentley, go to section 5, page 62, figure 17-8. You
will need to install the flat washers, wave washers, and spacers.

 The valve springs are also stiffer, but I have never had a problem using
solid lifter springs.
