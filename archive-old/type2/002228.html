I have been a bus owner for about 6 months. At nearly 50 years old, I often
wonder what the heck I was thinking in buying a VW camper. I remember the
TR3s, the muscle cars, the cad*ys, etc. Then my thoughts return to that
Rainbow chick I spent a few nights with a few years ago in *her* camper and
say to myself &quot;oh, yeah, that's why&quot;

After being on the list for the time I have owned a bus, I have a sense that
everyone has a &quot;reason&quot; for owning one. This is definitely not a mode of
transportation that one buys because one needs a practical, affordable car,
one that will reliably get one back and forth to work and still be able to
get the kids to the soccer games on Saturdays. I suspect, though, that the
underlying reason for owning a bus, maybe a reason long since forgotten by
some is the &quot;Spirit of the 60s&quot;, the ideals of that generation, the concept
of a loving community (wouldn't that have been nice), etc. I recently went
to a bus club meeting in my area. The people looked like people do
everywhere nowadays, but the club T shirt was tie dye!

You might think I am headed toward a &quot;c'mon, guys, let's all get along&quot;
spin, but no. Rather, my point is that there was a common component to those
old days, a common characteristic to those &quot;original&quot; bus families, and one
that I think many on the list share today. They were all broke! Like I am
now! Keep the affordable parts coming.
