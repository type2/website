Many thanks Richard, very clear!! I seem to have a high idle as well, and after reading the fellows post about the decel valve, I notice that my hose off the decel valve is disconnected and just sitting there. From your picture it is the big one on top going off to the left of the pic. I know this should be connected to something. Could this be why I have a high idle?
