Subject: Re: [T2] Belly Pan Question

Richard, 
By pointing out that 73 Westy bodies are different than 68-72 Westy bodies, I was thinking that this may mean 73 may also have no belly pan, as reinforcement was added to the roof.  In fact, my 73 has no weld marks or holes where a belly pan might have been.  
Anyone else know?

&gt;&gt;73 is an exception from 68-72 in that for 73, VW did not give Westy the sunroof model but simply a bus with a big hole in the roof (same size as sunroof).
