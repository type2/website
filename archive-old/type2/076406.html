Subject: Re: [T2] Spare tire hold down?

Here, here! I too am guilty as charged and as soon as I get home tonight I'm 
going to see to it that my tire is strapped down, and everything else is put 
away or removed. After hearing the stories about the rollovers and 
accidents, my eyes are opened a bit more.

Marko, glad to hear that you're still around, sorry to hear about the death 
of your bus, but it sure beats hearing about the death of a list member.

I've only had my bus for about 9 months, and my 1 year old spends a lot of 
time in there. So any kind of preventative safety measures, even simple 
things like keeping the spare in place, are one of reasons I stay on this 
list.

Let's all try and keep the shiny side up during the winter months so we can 
meet our fellow bus brethren and sisters in the summer.
