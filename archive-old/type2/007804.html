Checked in with local VW guru and he had two suggestions.
1) you cannot afford to pay me to fix this :)&gt;
2) With the T4 engine it would be easier to pull the axels and drop the
tranny to access the clutch and its associated components. 

I have neither pulled the engine or dropped the tranny before. Davd Schwarze
whose opinion I value suggests pulling the two together. I have one floor
jack to work with so I wonder whether this is feasible?. Opinions are
welcome

&gt; In each case the engine has to come out. Good luck! Greensboro is too far

How far is too far to drive for free beer? What if  pizza is offered with
beer? :)&gt;
