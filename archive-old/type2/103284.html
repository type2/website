&gt; &gt; What happened with you defective head? Did the rebuilder make good on it?

&gt; 
&gt; Well, I sent the head back to AVP per their instructions and I checked the
&gt; UPS tracking number and it was delivered to them over a week ago.... they
&gt; haven't called me back yet about the issue. I called them this evening and
&gt; got an answering machine and left my number ...still no call back.

have some patience at this point, the Northeast has been hit by the worst
snowstorm in history.  most areas are shut down, electric and phone
service is iffy...
