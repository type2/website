&gt;Last week I drove my bus a good distance in the pouring rain.  It was about
&gt;a 3 hour drive.  When I got to my destination I set my emergency brake and
&gt;left the bus for the weekend.  When I got back two days later, I started up
&gt;the bus and attempted to drive away... but my right rear wheel was locked up
&gt;so I could not move.

Not at all uncommon, although not usually on busses.
