&gt;I'm finally beginning to reassemble a 1976 2000cc engine for my 1975
&gt;bus. Last night I was going to replace the connecting rod bushings (the
&gt;little ends) when I decided to do a little measuring and fitting. I
&gt;found that the wrist pins seem like they wont fit into the new bushings?
&gt;Do I somehow have the wrong bushings? Do I need to hone the bushing to
&gt;allow the wrist pins to fit? Please help. I can't find any reference to
&gt;how the wrist pins should fit in the bushings. The old pins had a pretty
&gt;free fit in the old bushings. I think if I heat the rod and bushing the
&gt;pins may fit but when everything is at the same temp, I don't think the
&gt;pins will be able to rotate in the rods at all.

The wrist pins must slide into the bushings and be able to rotate.  They
should be a snug, but not tight fit.  If they don't fit you will have to
hone the bushings, but be careful not to overdo it and be sure to keep the
surface absolutely true.  If in doubt, have a shop do it for you or replace
the bushings with ones that are properly sized from the start.  If you
don't already have measuring tools like a micrometer and inside micrometer,
go get them and measure the pin and the bore to determine how much you are
off.  Don't short yourself on information when assembling an engine!  And
by all means don't use heat to install them.

&gt;Also, these bushings do not have the 2 little oil holes like the
&gt;original ones. Can I get away with drilling them after they are
&gt;installed in the rods? Should I leave them as is?

I can't answer that one - anyone else know?
