Joe Fournier asks,

&gt;Last Friday, Murphy played a cool trick on me: cool for him, that is.

&gt;He made my engine spit out the rear (RearIsRearOfBus) seal. I'm wondering
&gt;if anyone's successfully replaced this seal with the engine in the bus (or
&gt;half-way) dropped.

Yes, it can be done. In fact, I did it in a motel parking lot once. You 
just need to remove the middle rear tin piece, the fan, and the hub. 
Getting the hub off without the VW tool can be difficult; the best thing 
to do is to have a pulley or some other robust metal disk drilled with 
three holes so that you can bolt it to the hub, then pull with a puller.

The other trick is to get the new seal in straight and clean. This is a 
tough one, because there is not enough clearance to whack it in with a 
hammer and a block of wood all the way around. Use finesse.

Good luck.
