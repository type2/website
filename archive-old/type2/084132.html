&gt; Ok,, there has to be someone who will sell me a FM Bus privately! I'll
&gt; never win an auction with dial up connection! Them guys squeeze me at
&gt; the last second...

Jamie,
That sounds like good advice to me.  I checked the completed auctions on ebay
and found two recently closed, both between $80 and $85.  Bid $90 and sit back.
Here's one you can have a crack at
http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=1087120857

OR
you could round up a friend with a DSL connection and have them try and bid for
you

OR
you can subscribe to one of those auction bidding services where it will
automatically post your bid at the very last second.  You don't even have to be
around.  Snoozing away and winning bids.

Scott
