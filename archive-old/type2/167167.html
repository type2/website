Subject: mikes trip report

&quot; I think I'm still in denial that people are actually different outside of 
LA,&quot;

Mike, we can chat for days about that. I've been out of LB for only a month 
- a month today - and I'm still thrilled to be around genuine people now. 
They were in LB, just harder to find.

About the soapy water res: try soaking a vinegar solution in it, then flush 
it out 3 or 4 times. If that doesn't work, maybe scrubbing with baking soda. 
One or the other - not together: unless you want a volcano flow.

Glad you're back safely!!

Stef
