Vacuum Distributor!?!?

Bob
&gt; Here is the perplexing problem.  The two  whose engines have never been
&gt; pulled make the transition off idle the way I remember vws when I bought
&gt; them new many years ago.  For all five that have been rebuilt- various
&gt; combinations of vacuum distributors, 009s, dual Kadrons, and 34PICT 3s are
&gt; represented in this group -   the transition off idle and at low rpm is
&gt; more a chugging than a smooth pull.  Unless one is generous with the pedal,
&gt; all five act this way.
