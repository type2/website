Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Depot Heads

&gt; &gt; has anybody had experience with the $189 heads that Bus
&gt; &gt; Depot offers?  Mr. Salmon, could you weigh in with some 
&gt; &gt;details about the improved valve seat design?

&gt; Bus Depot sells AVP heads, right?  If so, you might be able 
&gt; to get more info from www.avpworldwide_dot_com


The weakness of the Type 4 head has historically been their valve seats,
which have a tendancy to &quot;drop&quot; if the head is overheated (and even
sometimes if it is not). While some may argue as to whether there is an
inherent flaw with the type 4 head design, the fact remains that there a
huge percentage of type 4 head failures are due to dropped seats. So
even if one were not to go as far as to claim there to be an intrinsic
design flaw, it cannot be denied that the valve seats are the type 4
head's weak point.

There have been a couple of rebuilders that have addressed this issue by
specially peening and heat treating the seats. This seems to almost
completely eliminate this tendancy. The two companies most known for
this are/were Mark Stephens (now defunct) and AVP.  Mark Stephen's,
whose slogan was &quot;never again a dropped seat,&quot; had a nasty habit of
keeping most or all of your core deposit, on the grounds that the head
you sent back needed &quot;extra work&quot; to be rebuildable. This is frankly not
unusual.  a common ploy used by rebuilders. They use their core deposit
as a profit center, chipping away at your core refund unless the head
you sent back is so clean that it didn't need rebuilding in the first
place!  AVP has never played these games. They use this special valve
seat design on every type 4 head they build, whereas some rebuilders
don't even replace the seats at all if they &quot;look&quot; okay - which is
almost a guarantee of future failure!  In fact even the brand new type 4
heads (made by AMC/Spain) do not use this improved valve seat design. So
AVP's heads are actually more reliable than new.  

I have used AVP exclusively for our rebuilt type 4 engines and heads for
years and cannot say enough good things about this company. They are a
small, family run business, not a mass-producer, and unlike other VW
rebuilders their speciality is Bus/Vanagon engines. They're not a Bug
engine rebuilder who &quot;by the way&quot; also can sell you a Bus engine. Most
importantly, they genuinely care about their customers and the quality
of their product. I have almost never had a defect on an AVP rebuild,
and in the rare cases that one has occurred, they've gone above and
beyond in standing behind their product. I have seen them stand behind
engines and heads that were clearly abused or improperly installed,
which no one else would have covered. In fact I would go as far as to
say that of all of the vendors I deal with (and I deal with hundreds of
them), AVP is by far the most customer-oriented of them all. If all of
my suppliers had the &quot;customer first&quot; attitude that AVP has, my job
would be a whole lot easier!  It's for this reason that I won't sell
anyone else's rebuilds, even though I could make more money if I did.

Incidentally, I personally have used AVP rebuilds on my last three
Westies.
