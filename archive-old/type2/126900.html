Subject: Re: [T2] 1979 Westy donor to '79 Kombi sunroof

&gt; town as a daiy driver? I believe the sunroof model
&gt; has the same roof opening
&gt; as the Westy. Can you conform this? Any tips on
&gt; moving the pop-top over?

The roof opening of the early Westy's (up to 1973 I
think) is indeed the same as the roof opening of a
sliding roof. But from 1974 the roof opening became a
whole lot bigger. But who knows: may be you only need
the smaller sliding roof hole...I am not really a
Westy expert.
