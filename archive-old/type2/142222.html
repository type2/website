&gt;Remember, after the valve stretchs to the point where the valve gap is
&gt;zero, there is no force left to stretch the valve.  It'll burn the valve
&gt;and seat, but it won't stretch any more!

I see two problems after that happens:

- the neck of the valve is weakened by the stretching and breaks off before the reduced clearance is eliminated by engine heating. This happens mainly because the clearance is reset to 0.006 after it was noticed that the valve went tight.

- the head of the valve deforms from the the heat because it cannot seat properly, makes contact with the seat and then breaks off.
