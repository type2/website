&gt; I'm having starting problems with my 75 bus with a 79

&gt; runs for 3 to 5 seconds, then stops..  Do it again-
&gt; same result. Again, and it runs for  3 to 5 seconds.  
&gt; Finally, the 4th attempt results in a running engine. 
&gt; If it is warm outside, it may continue running after 3

&gt; run on the first try.

definately sounds like the temp sensor, does it run really rough at first,
the first couple seconds is probably starting from the cold start injector
and system, then when it cuts out the main system should keep you running
(very oversimplified) but it is not getting a reading or getting an
incorrect reading from the head sensor. as the engine warms from running
it has been tuned well enough to keep running

&gt; I have shop manuals, and decided to run through the
&gt; procedures to check the FI system. New points,

&gt; Everything checked out okay until I got to the part
&gt; about checking the temperature sensor #2 (the one on
&gt; the head by #3 cylinder).  I find no temp sensor #2. 

AS far as I know there is only one temp sensor and it is on cyl head near
the #3 cyl

&gt; Am I hallucinating? Did they put it somewhere else on
&gt; some engines?  I don't really want to take everything

don't know of it being anyplace else,  does the head have a hole for the
sensor, just forward of the #3 spark plug on the flat part there should be
a hole through the tin into the head.  is it possible that when the engine
was assembled they used your old tin and covered over the hole for the
sensor and didn't bother putting one on

&gt; apart to pull the cooling tin and check out the
&gt; cylinder head itself.
&gt; Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

you can pull up the edge of the tin by the #3 spark plug and look under
with a mirror, if there is a threaded hole then just cut out a little tin,
a nibbler would work great, and stick in a sensor (Ron and others have em)
now finding the wire to hook it up too might be problematic since it may
have been cut off, or it could just be laying there for you to hook it too

&gt; I have had other late model buses, but they were all
&gt; earlier and this is the first fuel injected one that I
&gt; have had.

you really do need that sensor for the engine to run, I am almost
surprised it even runs at all without a sensor when starting especially.

maybe someone with a FI engine will let you take a look at theirs, where
are you located??   

good luck
