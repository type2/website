Subject: '72-'74 versus '79 heat exchangers?

Another one, if one were building a square port head engine to put into a '72
or '73 using '79-'83 heads and used the available federal '79 heat exchangers,
what engine tin and steel tubes up to the flapper valves work?  Would the 
'72/'73 stuff work (the front lower tins and under pushrod tins?) are the
outlets
of the '79 exchangers round like the early or oval like the '76-'78?

Don't have the parts in front of me at the moment, can't remember as I haven't
seen '79 stuff in 4 years, and am trying to figure it out.

Thanks
