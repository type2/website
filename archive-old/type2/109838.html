&lt;&lt; My point is we all use import parts to replace the old US spec stuff but 
when EVERYTHING is labelled imported isn't somebody (border inspectors) 
going to develop an attitude? Maybe get it across the border and then do 
the swapper-roony? Not that I've ever crossed that border and have the 
slightest idea of what it is like. Maybe nobody cares... &lt;grin&gt;

Don't know about crossing the Mexican border, but crossing the Canadian
border with an old Morgan in the bed of an F250 was bad enough...Besides,
I'd tend to think border guards are a bit testy these days, no...?-(
