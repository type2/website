Tom, Don, Hal,

Thanks for the nice comments on the bus...I have 2 years of 
restoration and more money than I can account for in it.&lt;grin&gt;
and I *do* grin when I drive it!!(when I'm not nervous about someone 
hitting me). 


Hal, The heads were pretty much perfect.  The # 2 exhaust didn't mate
&quot;perfectly&quot; as the others did, but I put new early model heater boxes
on it when I re-did it and they fit quite well.  When I stop for
a light, I sometimes wonder if it is still running...it is very quiet.

I *did* pull the valve covers off and sand blast them and powder
coated them and then put them back on.  One or two of the push rod
tubes seemed to leak a little, but after I drove 50 miles to the show
in Eureka Springs, there was no leakage at all.  The bottom side of that
engine(after about 1,000) miles looks the same as it did in the picture.

My only problem was having to take it partially back apart cause the 
oil cooler *I* put on it started leaking....I had cleaned and 
pressure tested it prior to assembly too!

Hal, how may miles on yours and how is it running?  

Cheers, dave

&gt; Looks about like the AVP I got from aircooled_dot_net.  Did you have to fark around with the
&gt; exhaust studs to get the heaterboxes on?  Mine were ever so slightly not-straight.
