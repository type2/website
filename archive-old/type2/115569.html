Subject: popping and the repair shop

  Well, I took it out once again for a short trip to the bank.  Same issues. 
  When I returned, I noticed alot of condensation on the manifold under the 
carb.  Carb was also very cold, and seems like it may now have some sort of 
icing problem.  I checked my new fuel filter that was replaced yesterday.  
It is attached before the fuel pump, and yes, it has a very good amount of 
rust particles in there.  Could the re-setting of the air fuel mixture 
caused this condensation?  Never had it before.  I think this may all be 
leading to a contaminated tank.
