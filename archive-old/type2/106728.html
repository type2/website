&gt; Not that I want to delve into anyone's possibly larcenous past, but is there
&gt; a non-destructive method of bypassing the ignition switch that will allow me
&gt; to start the bus?  Giacomo is my primary vehicle, and I need him running in
&gt; order to get parts.

Does anyone have a better idea than the usual remote starter switch?

&gt; I'm looking at possibly getting a used ignition switch from a local VW mech.
&gt; Is going used a good idea/bad idea?  Whether new or used, is it possible to
&gt; re-key the ignition to match the door keys ($11.00 last week for keys, don't
&gt; really want to waste it)?

Try Steve Sandlin &lt;www.steveslockshoppe_dot_com&gt; or Gabriel Garcia
&lt;gabvwkey_at_cs_dot_com&gt;. Both of those guys do that kind of work all the time. I
saw a new ignition switch a Gabriel's swap table on Sat. for $100. Ouch.

&gt; Thanks for the help.  I don't know how I'd get back into buses without this
&gt; group of wonderful people.

Me neither.
