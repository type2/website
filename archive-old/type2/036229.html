Subject: Brake Dilemma:'69 Westy

To Jaime---------

Too bad this isn't 1997:  I gave a few dozen Type 2 brake drums to a local
VW shop because there just wasn't space in my then-new living quarters.

If I were in your place, I would look around for a couple of replacement
drums, buy them and put them on the shelf, as insurance for when you rebuild
your brakes.  Also this would give you a pretty good idea of your
dollar-exposure if you score your rear drums beyond remachining limits.  I'd
keep driving -- in rainy/snowy/cold weather it's no fun to do a brake job,
even indoors...... unless you have a nice heated garage.

Be aware there are two common widths of rear brake shoes on the Type 2 [that
I know of].  So measure your drum along the direction parallel to the axle,
and match this dimension with what you buy.

Best of luck,
