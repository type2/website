Ok. With all of this talk about late paint codes, it has me wondering about my own.  Where do I find the durn thing?!?  I've looked anywhere, nothing even resembling the codes listed the other day.  Help me!  Also, does anyone know the production run for 1969?  I just want to know where I stand in it (239-180-097).

Those old digests got me thinkin, too... I've seen a rear(In the cargo Hatch!) louvered loaf westy window somewhere.. anyone got the low-down on this too-cool item?  I _KNOW_ they exist! Saw them at a show a few years ago, cranked it with my very own hands.  Was in a highroof camper.  Oh, well. Dreams.
