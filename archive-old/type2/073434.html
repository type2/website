Subject: Re: mixing octane?
Message-Id: &lt;v0401170eb4330fa8c6fe_at_[207.138.30.76]&gt;

&gt;I got a quick simple question about fuel octane.
&gt;  when your tank is half full of 87, and you add the other half full with 89,
&gt;does it all mix and make 88, or will the gas have a natural tendencie to stay
&gt;seperate?

They mix.  In fact, when you get mid-grade 89 at the pump (at least in
Texas, not sure about other places), what you are actually getting is a
mixture of 87 and 93 octane gas.  The pump just pulls from both tanks, at a
specific ratio (two to one in this case).  The gas stations don't want to
have to produce, ship, and store three kinds of gas when they only really
have to handle two, you see.

I didn't know this until one day when I was filling up with 89 and the gas
was coming out real slow.  Reason being they were out of 87, which meant
that I was getting straight 93 octane gas but only paying for 89.  Needless
to say, I didn't mind waiting a few extra minutes for the tank to fill.  :)
