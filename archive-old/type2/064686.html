Subject: RE: Olympics/Mike Hall/62 Splittie

Just letting everyone know that one of our Olympic Gold hopefuls is a
guy named Mike Hall and he drives a beautiful 62 Split Window. I believe
he is a free-style swimmer. They did a up close and personal with him on
the Today show this morning.  Pretty hip guy. He has to race against a
swimmer known as the Russian Rocket.  So let's all wish him luck and
the rest of America's finest.
