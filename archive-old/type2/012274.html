Subject: gas heater fuel pump
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I need some help Volks.  I just got a 12v BN2 gas
heater and I'm having problems with the fuel pump.  It
gets power to the terminals (I've hooked it up
direct)and I get no clicks or pumping.  I regapped and
set the points and filed them down and they make good
connections.  I've checked the diaphragm for holes and
re-set it for volume, and cleaned the vent hole. I
also checked continuity on the leads to the coil ans
it has arount 6 ohms of resistance.

I don't know what else to do.  Any suggestions, or is
it unrepairable?
