Subject: New Head

After a year of bad valve chatter and fouled plugs in my #3,#4 side, I've
decided to replace the head on that side when I drop my engine next weekend-
finally going to replace those leaky seals!
Although my compression is good 130lbs the whole way 'round, lifters
pumped,new coil, wires......
The tapping and fouling seem to suggest something's amiss on that side.

I've gotten every thing I can think of for the job including a
remanufactured head from the Bus Depot. I expect it any day now.
Q: If the head is bad, what will I be looking for?
Q: Is there a gasket between head and cylinder?Bentley speaks of gasket
rings. I assume they must be replaced w/ new ones? Do I have to buy a whole
gasket kit to get them?=$60?

Any advise is appreciated.
