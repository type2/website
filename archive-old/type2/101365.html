&lt;&lt; I've been told that if you get an old Pinto air-cleaner from a junkyard, it

has an intake for the heat riser. I have a generic circular cleaner on mine

and am not sure right now how I'll make sure that the warm air from my fabbed

riser will be drawn in over the cold air from the rest of the engine

compartment.

Hey, look over there...A whole herd of Pintos...Sorry to josh you, but
Pintos are long gone from junkyards. Besides, I thought most of 'em
were burned in rear enders...
With the limitations on junkyards, these days, most stuff is under
ten years old anyway...At least around here.
