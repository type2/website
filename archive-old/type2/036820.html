Subject: Need help with VDO cyl. head temp gauge

First off, I checked the archives and didn't see anything about the problem 
I'm having.  I started to install my gauges today in my '78. On the 
instruction sheet that came with the CHT gauge it showed 4 terminalson the 
back of the gauge labeled 1, 2, +, and -.
The problem is that my gauge has only the + and - terminals.  There are no #1 
or #2 terminals.  I had to lengthen the sender wires about 6 inches(almost!) 
so I realize that the accuracy will be compromised some--and I hooked the red 
wire from the sender to the + and the black wire to the - terminal (seemed 
logical). I installed the sender on the #3 spark plug.  Then I fired it up.
Doesn't work. 
What did I do wrong?  How else could it be done? There is no way to follow 
the instructions.
Is this some sort of updated gauge in which the other terminals are deleted?  
Could it be the wrong gauge for the application? (I ordererd all of the 
gauges from The Bus Depot, and the CHT sender was included in a kit with the 
CHT gauge, so this is unlikely, I think).
The only other connections are the two threaded studs that hold the U shaped 
clip on the back to mount the gauge to the pod.
Could it be a sender problem?  How can I check the sender?
Please help!  I want to get that thing working.  Anyone had this problem 
before?
Many thanks,
