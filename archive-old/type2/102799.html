Subject: Re: [T2] Bosch H4 ... and less expensive alternatives 

&gt; Richard--
&gt; 
&gt; And you are correct on the fit of these lamps--they are a loose fit--and
&gt; are loose in the buckets--
&gt; 
&gt; I had to lay a bead of silicone all the way around the back side of the
&gt; bucket and let it harden up to keep them from rattling.

I got some Hellas for my bus a while back. Some of them come with new
retainer rings that hold them in tightly. Mine didn't so I got a couple
rubber seals made for bug headlights and stretched them over the
Hellas, and they fit nice and tight now. I'm afraid I don't have the
part number anymore for the seals, but they should be easy to find.
