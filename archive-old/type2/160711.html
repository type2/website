&gt; Have you attempted a rebuild of your louvers? It's a lot of work, but
&gt; my faith in them has been restored since talking to a bus owner while
&gt; I was in CA that recently did his. They move smooth as silk and have
&gt; no rattles, even when driving with them open.

I don't have my Bentley in front of me, but I don't remember reading a
procedure in there.  You wouldn't happen to have a procedure or a link
to one for this, would ya Don?  I already have too many pots on the
boil to do it myself this year, but so far my 2008 is pretty open :D 
My jaleous windows rattle and clatter from engine startup to shutdown. 
I like them when we're camping, though.

TIA,
