Subject: BN4 Relay Question

Friends,

I'm getting closer to being able to put this heater together, but I've
got a couple more questions...

It appears that I'm missing the relay between the switch and the
terminals on the heater itself.  Is it a DPDT or DPST relay (or
something else entirely)?  Looks like it's supposed to have 4
connections (plus ground)...I imagine any 12v 30A relay would do the
trick, but I'd like to know if someone out there could confirm what an
&quot;adequate&quot; (at least) relay would be for this job...I'm pretty new at
reading wiring diagrams.

Also, I'm curious if anyone had a source for BN4 ductwork.  I'm
expecting to fabricate it myself, but it never hurts to ask.

Finally, on an unrelated note, I'm curious if anyone out there has some
old bus curtain rods they want to part with.

Thanks folks,

Jonathan
