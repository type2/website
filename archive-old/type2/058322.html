&gt; &gt; I think the Kamm Effect is one of those 'better but not perfect' items -
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; teardrop shape WOULD reduce drag as much as possible, but then you'd
&gt; have a
&gt; &gt; bus 20 feet long!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Sometimes yes, sometimes no... the air flowing over the surface causes a
&gt; bit of friction itself, so if the surface is smaller (e.g. the back end
&gt; is chopped off like our busses) the resulting skin friction drag is
&gt; reduced.  If the airflow's already turbulent, then it doesn't make a
&gt; huge difference, but if  the vehicle designers have done a good job and
&gt; the flow is laminar (smooth), an abrupt end to the body is just peachy.
&gt; 
&gt;

	 Getting way off base here, but.... If you break the flow off
sharply enough, can you 
	get a virtual surface, like a boat hull can have a virtual hull, and
therefore extended 
	waterline when planing? I had a windsurfer that would have 8 -10
feet of virtual
	waterline. You could see the shape of the virtual hull in the water
like it was made from
	clear plastic.
	IE: Can you get the benefits of a 'virtual teardrop'  without the
associated drag?
	I suspect yes but due to density, reynolds numbers etc, the effect
would only work for
	centimeters, not 20 feet.

	Sorry
