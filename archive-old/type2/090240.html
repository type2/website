&gt; How cold does it get where you are?

I am not in TX, but in VA.  Here it gets to 0F on very rare occasions,
usually the lowest is in the 20's

&gt; Do you think the 5W50 work in the real/real cold?

Superbly!  5W oil is made for very low temps!

&gt; I have pesky leaks on the valve covers that wont go
&gt; away.  DO I need to make it leak proof prior to
&gt; changing?

First, price synthetics.... how many cans of $5+/qt oil do you want to
add?  the *first* thing you need to do before you switch is make sure
there are no leaks in your block!  This is not for mechanical reasons, but
financial ones :-)
