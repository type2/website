The closest thing I found in a spray can was Krylon Truck and Van Paint,

Picked up a bottle of both and tried test spot with each.
#3300 is a tad too white
Wimbledon is a tad off by something ever so minuscule, yellow maybe??

This search for the perfect touch up paint kind of reminds me of the 
three bears and the porridge.
I can go to the automotive paint supply house here in Houston and have 
a few cans made up for $$$, so guess maybe I will give that a try.

Still searching for that perfect white (other than Dick Cheney)
