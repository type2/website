Subject: RE: [T2] 1971 Westfalia: Which muffler? &amp; Advice for
  Massachusetts  Inspection

David,

My experience with Mass inspection is they are overly strict when it comes
to inspecting cars. It's a nice backhanded way of them forcing you to drive
a new car and pay the state more money in taxes. I've heard of them failing
cars for pinholes of rust or even slighly opaque lenses in newer cars. I
live in CT, but my wife's family is from Mass and I hear lots of horror
stories.

My advice... if you have holes, worn tires or Godforbid, ehaust problems.
Don't go into inspection until it is all fixed. I don't know what others
will say but I wouldn't rush it and instead make sure she's close to 100%
before going through. That or move south of the border... we don't have
inspections for cars under 25 years old in CT and over that, they're still
pretty easy.
