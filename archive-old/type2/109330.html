&gt; There are two differnet sides with two different part numbers.  211 255
482B and 211 255 481B.  The prongs that hold them in are angled differently
and are not interchangeable.  They are also curved very slighly the long
way.

Right on.  #211-255-482-B goes on the passenger side, and #211-255-481-B on
the driver's side.  I hadn't pulled the driver's because it was too early in
the morning to do &quot;bus yoga&quot; to get to the driver's side vent insert. :O)

Both of mine seem to be in good shape overall.  They'll need a little clean
up, but it shouldn't be a job like the long mirror stem has been.
