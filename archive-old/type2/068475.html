Subject: Re: 3rd Gear grinding Sound and Radio Install and Brakes

&gt; 1) When I shift from 2nd to 3rd, there is a slight grind noise, like I tried
&gt; to do it without the clutch.  If I wait till the rpm's drop quite a bit (I
&gt; have no tach) it doesn't grind, but none of the other gears do this.  I read
&gt; the post about shifting linkage and possibly one of Rev. Bob's homiletic
&gt; prizes on shifting, and nothing was really mentioned about this.  Any clues?
&gt;  I just put in a new clutch cable, but it was doing this before I did that.
&gt;  (my old one broke)

I would say that your new cable has stretched some and you should try 
tightening it up a bit more. It is not uncommon for the cable to stretch 
and also notuncommon for the tranny to only grind in one gear.  good luck!
