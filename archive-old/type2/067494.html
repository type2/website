&gt;Mark Twain National Forest (near Springfield, MO)
&gt;Ozark National Forest (NW Arkansas)
&gt;Colorado (in one of the many parks)

I am not familiar with any of these parks, but I do have a suggestion of my
own.  Hot Springs National Park in Hot Springs Arkansas.  From what I've
gathered, this (or maybe its another Hot Springs somewhere else) is a
pretty common spot for VW enthusiasts.  I stumbled upon it in my first, and
quite spur-of-the-moment road trip and really enoyed the atmosphere of the
park as well as the town of Hot Springs.  I think I mentioned before that I
met a family at the campsite who were living out of a great old school bus
and working wherever they could.  They were also teaching their 7- or 8-
year old child Japanese.  Wow.  That's pretty much in a centrally-located
position as well, so maybe I can enter it in as a nomination?
