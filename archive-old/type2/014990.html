There goes Clark, spreading lies about me again! ;) Getting the FI wiring
figured out was HARD! Without the help of the list and the Bosch FI book,
I'd still be scratching my head. And in fairness to the Carb contingent, I
haven't realized enough trouble-free time in the saddle to say it's a
benefit. In theory, it looks like FI is a better idea. In practice...well,
ask me after I have a little more practice. In theory, the FI conversion
should have been *easy* too, but keep in mind that my wiring harness is 20+
years old, and unless you buy a new one, yours will be too. Connectors will
need attention, and wires may be damaged. I started with unknown condition
of FI parts, and some of them were bad...and I didn't know enough to
troubleshoot that. The FI Troubleshooting site
(http://www.simplecom_dot_net/dakhlia/afc/afc.html) was an enormous help! And
without Karl von Salzen, I never would have figured out the vacuum setup.
Then there were the parts, with Karl and John Anderson coming to my rescue
along with others.

As for the conversion issue, let me toss in a twist: 

I was trying to build a 2.0 liter engine on the cheap and scrounging
parts/deals from whereever I could. In retrospect, I believe this is false
economy. Shortcuts tend to cost far more in time, money, and frustration. I
came in only slightly lower in terms of cost that I would have to buy a
good rebuild from a reputable mechanic. It took me many months to do this
and my family endured hardships I'd rather not recount. In truth, we play
our checkbook close to the curb, so if I had to do it over again, I'd
probably have the same choices to make. (Thank God I have a good retirement
program.)

What I ended up with is a Type IV engine without a proper designation.
Check this out for a mix/match of parts:

- '77 case (came stock with solid lifters)
- hydraulic lifters and cam (solid cam was heavily worn)
- 2.0 liter pistons and cylinders
- 1.8 liter heads
- FI from '77

This powerplant was installed in my '72 Riviera. I used the '72 tranny, but
I had to use the '77 bellhousing and starter to match the later flywheel.

What fascinates me about this journey is that I had never even seen a Type
IV engine before I began, even though I'd built several earlier bus
engines. Most of the knowledge to accomplish this mix came from the list or
from commonly available reference books. By far, the mix-and-match info
came from the list.

I don't have empirical data on the performance of this engine, nor can I
compare it to others. This is the only Type IV bus I've ever driven. I will
tell you that it blows the socks off the Type I buses I've driven, in terms
of power and performance. I can be going 75 MPH uphill and tap the gas and
she'll give me more.

I don't know what the top-end speed is, nor do I know what the fuel economy
is. I have had bad exhaust leaks up until now and I still have a slight
vacuum leak from the brake booster. Until I fix that, I can't dial the
engine in right to get a true performance/economy reading. My *guess* is
that I'll see between 14 and 17 mph in city driving, but highly related to
the weight of my foot. I tend to go a little faster than I ought to because
it's still quite a novelty not to be the slowest on the road...and I love
the idea that I'm shattering stereotypes about buses. Some days I'd like to
get a bumper sticker that says: &quot;Pass me if you can.&quot;   ;) Joe
