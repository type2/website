Subject: Vacuum Hose Sizes

Due a small, but nonetheless still a demand, here are some diameters 
and lengths of the vacuum hoses on my '80 FI Vanagon.  Most 
of this information will apply to any of the FI busses.  I recently 
replaced these hoses.  I measured them after installation, so the 
diameters had stretched a little.  So far I have found that on a '76 the 
Fuel Pressure Regulator is located differently than mine (R vs L).
If anyone knows the REAL diameter (as opposed to measured) I would be 
more than happy to update this list.

Intake: the area immediately after the AFC control box and before the 
throttle.

Diameters listed are ID, unless otherwise mentioned.

Intake to Oil Breather: 7/8&quot; (22mm) x 10 5/8 &quot; long
Intake to Aux Air Regulator: 9/16&quot; (14mm) x 9 &quot; long
Aux Air Regulator to Manifold: 9/16&quot; (14mm) x 3 1/2&quot; long
Intake to Deceleration Valve: 3/4&quot; (19mm) x 13 1/2&quot; long
Deceration Valve to Plastic Tube: 1/2&quot; (12mm) x 2 3/4&quot; long
Plastic Tube: 5/8&quot; OD x 1/6&quot; wall x 11 1/2&quot; long
Distributor Top to Throttle (Fwd Top): 3mm x 18&quot; long
Distributor Rear to Throttle (Rear Bottom): 3mm x 20&quot; long
Manifold to &quot;T&quot;: 3mm (1/8&quot;) x 20&quot; long
&quot;T&quot; to Pressure Regulator: 3mm (1/8&quot;) x 2&quot; long
&quot;T&quot; to Deceleration Valve: 3mm (1/8&quot;) x 8&quot; long

The long 3mm lines have a 4mm OD plastic line starting about 4 inches 
from termination to break up the long length of hose.  Not necessary 
for function, but probably original.  Have not found a source for 
this pipe stuff yet.  Also not found a source for the 3mm hose 
either.  I cut off the expanded section and managed to make it fit.

On the 3mm hose, it is VERY easy to mistake 5/32&quot; or 3/16&quot; for 1/8&quot; hose
or 3mm stuff.  I have some SLIGHTLY larger than 4mm that will NOT 
make a tight seal where it looks like it would.

I used hose clamps on all the larger hoses except the Oil Breather 
and none on the 3mm ones.
