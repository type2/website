Dave:

I just got these rubber boots from Ron at Bus Depot.  They are also known as
1600 dp manifold boots.  Ask to speak with Ron directly if the person on the
phone doesn't know what you're talking about;  this is a &quot;non traditional&quot;
use of this part, i.e. because of the use of the Weber carb on the VW.
You'll need four.

Anyone with a Weber carb should take a look at these;  mine (came with carb)
were badly cracked after only 2 years...Made quite a difference when
replaced.

Good luck.

&gt; I need to buy the rubber connectors that go from the
&gt; base of the single carb to the 4 intake runners.  I've called
&gt; a few parts places, but they want a part number.  Does anyone
&gt; have the part number so I can order these parts?
&gt;
&gt; BTW, these are for a '72 bus, type 4 engine with the single
&gt; carb conversion.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
