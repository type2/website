I'd'a posted this last friday cuz that's when I saw 'em, but was on the road
and in meetings all day.  Here in KY we aren't exactly et up by VWs.  Headed
to Louisville via. the West KY Parkway.  Stopped in Princeton for lunch at a
restaurant with a big &quot;EAT&quot; sign (quaint!).  While ordering, some canary
yellow caught my eye.  A big, bright yellow poptop in back of the
restaurant.  Absolutely gorgeous!

Finished lunch, paid.  As I step out the door I see there's a second bus
beside the camper.  I tell my friend that I GOTTA take a minute to look.
I'm anything but a bus authority, all I can say was that neither was a
split, and for my money they both looked like my 72.  The bus was tan, a
little beaten up and dented but not bad to my eye.  The camper looked SO
good...til I got within ten feet or so.  Paint on top of chipped paint, and
a little rust was showing through here 'n there.  Actually, it might not be
a bad thing.  They didn't do the bondo-the-crap-out of it route.  Looked
more like a decent attempt at restoration.

I didn't have time for a good look.  Boxes of stuff inside but the front
seats were empty.  They may not have been used in a while but don't have the
&quot;abandoned&quot; look to them.  So my VW colleague is going to call the
restaurant and find out if the camper is for sale.  If so we may run up and
take a better look.

Perchance, if the owner is on this list and wants to sell, email me...
