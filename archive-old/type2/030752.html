&gt; Moral: '68-71, no original rear trans support.  On US models at least
&gt; (can't speak for others).  '72-79, supports on bellhousing.  
&gt; 
&gt; Any corroborative evidence?

Skutter's a 71. My former rip-off mechanic told me that sie's got a newer
tranny, with a different gear ratio. Sie's still not running. :( Sie's
at home and I'm at work, so I can't look to see about the supports on the
bellhousing, but I know that the tranny isn't supported in the rear by the
bus. &gt; 

Kate without Skutter
