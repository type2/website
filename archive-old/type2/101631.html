Subject: [T2] 2 big little problems


&gt; Hey everyone,
&gt;   Here goes it.
&gt; I got the bus working yesterday and put the new plates on I went to take
it
&gt; on the road and things that were working last week are now mad at me. The
&gt; turn signals on my 76 bus which worked last week are functioning as brake
and
&gt; running lights but no longer flash, my horn, also working last week is no
&gt; longer working, and my dash lights, worked last week, are no longer
working.
&gt; Anyone have this problem before and if so please tell me its just a
fuse!!!!
&gt; Really if it's not tell me anyway.

John- It's Just a Fuse ! ( No,Really:)
Give all the fuses a turn to break corrosion.
Get the wiring diagram from www.vintagebus_dot_com
Verify every terminal on every defective item.
Meter Grounds,Bulbs,Switches and Volts.
Problem solved. ( What is the other problem:) ???
