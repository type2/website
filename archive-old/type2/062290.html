Nope.

A Weekender is the kind of bus that consumes all of your weekends.  I've got
one of those, too.  If you were truly devoted (obsessed?) you'd get a
Neverender.  I think Rusty VanBondo has one of those.  Of course, try and
stay away from the Rearender/Endoverender style busses.  They're more
maintenance still.  But all of these types of busses fall into the
Bigspender category. :(

I'm rusting poetic, it must be Friday somewhere.
