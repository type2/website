Subject: vw pics and vwoa license


I kinda hate to open this can of worms again, but has anyone seen this
yet?

http://vwlicense.ipprotector_dot_com/ent.html

Yes. I know it is on the &quot;evil' website, but after reading
thru it, it looks like it might be &quot;halfway&quot; reasonable.

The part that really bothers me though is this part...

&quot;Licensee is also permitted to display images of Volkswagen Vehicles, 
provided those images were not taken from the official Volkswagen website, 
www.vw_dot_com, or other Volkswagen copyrighted documentation.&quot;

So, does this mean that I m not permitted to show pics of any of my
vw vehicles unless I sign this agreement?....I don't think so...I &quot;own&quot;
those cars, I don't license them from vw like software.  And should be 
able to display pics of them anywhere I want ....and give others 
permission to do the same.

Ummm, you two lawyers out there...what think you?

Cheers ,dave
