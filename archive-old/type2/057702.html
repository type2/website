&gt;Just replaced the main seals on my 73 Westy since they were leaking and put
&gt;in a new clutch, since the leak had soaked it). She is now leaking oil
&gt;through the seam between the two halves of the engine. Mechanic says he can
&gt;pull the engine and properly fix the leak. Or, try to seal it from the
&gt;outside, which probably won't hold for very long.

I'd try to seal it from the outside first.  To do it &quot;properly&quot; means
tearing the engine completely down, which will cost you hundreds of dollars
of labor.  If he cleans the area really well and applies an industrial
strength sealant, it will probably hold.  There is not that much pressure
in the crankcase.

&gt;The bigger problem is that
&gt;the compression is 65, 70, 70, 70 and I'm wondering if I should spend any
&gt;more money on this engine.  She still runs great, but ...

If it runs great, then I would get a &quot;second opinion&quot; on the compression.
Make sure the engine is cranking quickly and that all four plugs are out
before they start testing.  If it's cranking slow it will give artificially
low compression readings.  The fact that all four are very close leads me
to believe that the reading was taken incorrectly, because of either the
engine turning too slow, or a bad seal on the compression tester.  Another
possibility is that &quot;someone&quot; might just be trying to sell you a new engine
to pay for their kid's dental work.

&gt;I can't do the work
&gt;myself and I need a couple of alternatives as to where to get a new engine.
&gt;I already know about GEX from the list (don' do it), mechanic says that he
&gt;can get an engine from VOA which will be around $2,000 completely installed
&gt;and has a 12-12 warranty anywhere in the US, which, as a middle-aged single
&gt;female, I like. However, it will take 3-4 weeks to get the engine. (There
&gt;goes Jerome, darn it!)

&gt;$2,000 seems like serious bucks for an engine and replacement. Is it?

Not for a '73.  That's a decent price, especially since it's rebuilt by
VWOA.  I I didn't even know they were rebuilding type IV engines.  But I'd
at least put this off till after Jerome... it's going to be the greatest VW
bus gathering yet!
