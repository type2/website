VW never made a headlight switch 211 941 531. VW could have had a casting
number for a headlight switch part. The correct switch for a 71 vw bus is
211 941 531 E. After market switches may or may not have the escutcheon. I
would recommend using your old one if it fits. This item is not as nice as
the original but, what can you do? BUStedVW has new switches and used ones
for these 71-79. The new ones sell for $35.00 and the used ones sell for
$21.00. There is usually no returns on electrical items so we recommend that
you do not try and rig something to work. Test all used switches with a
gauge before installing and beware of hot wires while installing headlight
switches.

AFAIK the 211 941 531E is a universal * aftermarket* headlight switch, and
fits 71 thru 79,  they don't come with the escutcheon/ring, and it would
need to be connected a little differently than the original.

We have the aftermarket one new, a good used one from a yard, and/or the
escutcheon/ring available.

&gt; I'm certain that Karl is correct; however, if you're not interested
&gt; in a 100 point restoration, you can also try a switch from a late
&gt; model Beetle.  That's what the PO did for my bus.  You might be able
&gt; to find one in a junkyark.  The only feature that doesn't work is the
&gt; indicator light in the instrument cluster that lets you know when the
&gt; parking lights are on.

&gt; &gt;No, 71 is one-year-only: 211 941 531 plain
&gt; &gt;There is a difference in the terminals.
&gt; &gt;The parts books are wrong. The E as it is will not work.
&gt; &gt;A while back someone posted a work-around circuit to make the E work
&gt; &gt;in a
&gt; &gt;71.

&gt; &gt;&gt; The 211 941 531E fits all type 2 buses from 1971 to 1979, the 531
&gt; &gt;A should
&gt; &gt;&gt; actually read 311 941 531A which fits 1968 to 1970 type 2's  and
&gt; &gt;other
&gt; &gt;VW's

&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Quick question (I hope)
&gt; &gt;&gt; I wish to replace my headlight switch for my 71 westy. Bus depot
&gt; &gt;has part
&gt; &gt;&gt; number &quot;211 941 531E&quot; for 71 thru 79, and &quot;211 941 531A&quot; for like
&gt; &gt;68-70.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Mine currently says &quot;211 941 531&quot; - NO LETTER. Will the &quot;E&quot; part
&gt; &gt;work
&gt; &gt;fine?
&gt; &gt;&gt; How about the &quot;A&quot; one? Anybody know the term numbers on each? I
&gt; &gt;sent an
&gt; &gt;&gt; email to Bus Depot and haven't yet heard a reply. Also - when you
&gt; &gt;order
&gt; &gt;&gt; these switches - do they come with the escutcheon?(The little ring
&gt; &gt;that
&gt; &gt;&gt; holds it into the dash) - mine is missing and my rheostat shot
&gt; &gt;switch is
&gt; &gt;&gt; currently dangling from the dash by the wires....
&gt; &gt;&gt; wink
