Subject: Re: [VB] Looking for Show Single Cab, what is it going to cost?

My wife has given me the okay to buy a perfect clean single cab, the only
catch is that I can't do anything to it, so it must be perfect.  What is
it going to cost me?

www.thesamba_dot_com is the place to go look.
Try to find one that will accommodate your new handicap.
I'd try to find and automatic with power steering since its going to cost
you an arm and a leg.
