When i was running the 74, i toyed with the idea of taking it down to the
local jake-leg dragstrip and running it just for laughs.

I have been advised that i would probably be the only one in my class and
would probably walk away with a trophy.
That would have been neat...

I'm kinda thinking about entering the VW drags at Bandemere after the RMMW
show 
this August.  I think I can take those 300 hp drag-bugs...

Actually, there was a guy that entered his stock 64 bus last year.  I don't 
understand drags, but apparently you win by staying closest to your time each

time?  Anyway, it was kinda fun watching.  He'd start off, people would go get

a beer at the concession stand, and come back and watch him finish :)
