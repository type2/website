Subject: Re: [T2] Type 4 questions



&gt;
&gt;1) Tried to time the engine yesterday, and the timing marks are gone.
&gt;Is this a decal, and if so, where can I get one?

Look for a tiny notch on the pulley(fan).  As to any decal, no.  There is a
plastic scale shaped like a fourth of a circle more or less that has &quot;o&quot; and
several BTDC and ATDC increments marked.  This is attached just left of the
fan pulley.  Contact a list vender, a good Cali junkyard, etc for the
plastic piece.

&gt;
&gt;2) The air pump on this engine has been disconnected from the exhaust
&gt;manifold, but is still mounted to the engine, and is connected by a
&gt;fan belt to a pulley that seems to be mounted to the center of the
&gt;fan.  The pulley doesn't turn with the fan - it seems to be
&gt;independent.  Can I remove all of the air pump related stuff without
&gt;difficulty?

I got lost in this description, but if it is an A/C system, sure you can
remove it.  Just make sure to replace any holes or gaps in the cooling tin.
&gt;
&gt;3) The electric fan mounted in the top of the engine compartment.
&gt;Does it have something to do with engine cooling?  Is it
&gt;thermostatically controlled?  Or is it only for passenger compartment
&gt;heating?
This is for heating the bus.  It is switched via the red levers on the dash.
&gt;
&gt;4) Finally, assuming that I need some engine parts, who/what is a good
source?
Now Dave, how can you live in Cali with a nice crop of busses and need to
ask where to get parts.  From your list of rides, I'd say the place for
parts is Daves garage.  JK, there are good list vendors that have tons of t4
parts. Junkyards and engine builders are great for the obscure stuff.
Good luck and welcome.

 Ha, I know, they are those old busses in the magazine pics of the shows in
Cali.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for the help
