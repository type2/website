Subject: Re: [T2] Legal assistance in Cincinnati

Mike,
I wasen't implicating any dishonesty, just how in the heck coud anyone
possibly know that a throw out bearing, brake line, or anything fail?
It's an imposssibiity to note everything that could possibly go
wrong--and to some folks, even if you disclosed every item that you know
about, something else could go wrong and it would be your fault------  

This is life in the big city--and there's not much you could ever do to
satisfy some people--regardless of your honest disclosures--

Like I said--how old are these things?

How long are they supposed to go without failure of one sort or another
?

You just can't cover it all---

Later,

Terry

 
E-mail message   
 
Hence my caveat that &quot;It's everything that I personally know is wrong
with the vehicle&quot;, and the big upper-case &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;NO RETURN&quot; on the
bill of sale. 
They sell a lot of used vehicles down here, so it's rather accepted that
there's probably going to be something wrong with it when it's sold.
It's just my own thing to be someone honest enough to fill you in before
you buy it.
