Subject: RE: [T2] Re: '76 Camper 1800cc to '72 Transporter?

&gt; The 2L is wider than the 1700/1800 (I think).


The engines are the same width and interchangeable. But BJ says this '76 has
an 1800 cc engine in it, not a 2000. That would mean the '76 does not have
the original engine, as it should indeed have a 2000. Look for the engine
code on the top of the block near the oil breather. If it's a 2 liter it
will start with either GD (solid-lifter, correct for a '76) or GE (hydraulic
lifter). Do not go by the stamping on the fan shroud, as someone may have
swapped out the engine without swapping out the fan shroud (or visa-versa).
In either case the engine will fit, and in fact there is little real-world
performance difference between the 1800 and the 2000.
