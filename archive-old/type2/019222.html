Jim,

Is your '71 Riviera a straight up small pop-top?  By that I mean, is it a 
squarish top, centered on the sliding door and pops up, but doesn't have any 
way to sleep up there?  A lot of the folks on the list with Riviera's have 
the larger 3/4ish pop-top, that sleeps two folks.

Mine is the small pop-top, centered on the sliding door.  The trim came off 
easily enough, and the wooden holder strips as well.   same as on the top.   
Take photos or good notes to remember how it looked and how it all went 
together..... I have a fairly good memory, but the time between taking the 
old top off and getting it back on was two years and I had to scratch my head 
a bit to get it all back together.

For the canvas top, I just bought some canvas at a fabric store, and sewed it 
together and laid out where I wanted my windows/screens.... I didn't bother 
with flaps or zippers.... my wife had to sew them in, as my skills were 
limited to joining the ends together.... her machine can handle the stiching 
of canvas.  I got a nice hunter green canvas, as the color scheme of my bus 
is hunter and cream..... so, I wanted the top to match the hunter green I was 
using for the new curtians, and to compliment the green in the seat/folding 
bed fabric replacement.

For me, I had the fiberglass top off to do some repairs and replace the inner 
liner.... so attached the canvas to the pop-top first, then set it on the 
roof and after getting the bars and springs reassembled, pushed up the top 
and pulled the canvas down snug and installed it.... the corners were a bit 
tricky, but getting the middles fastened first, and then smoothing the 
corners seemed to be the trick.

If you don't have the small squarish pop-top, then I figure the larger top 
might be similar, but a little tougher.  Hope this helps ya out a bit.  If ya 
don't sew, or have a friend that does, then an Auto upholstery shop, or even 
a furniture upholstery shop could probably fabricate a new top for you..... 
and the auto place may even be able to do the replacement.... but it will 
most likely be more expensive than doing it yourself....
