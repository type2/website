Subject: Re: [T2] Heater blower running hot

&gt; Did you replace the original holder?

Yes, the whole thing was disconnected and all the wires cut as it was
from a hot part of Australia hence I have replaced it with a spade
fuse connector. I would have wanted an original but the UK is dry for
parts.

&gt; How hot do the wires get? The smaller ones closest to the fan.

I checked them before, not hot just warm, the one with the fuse is not
bad at all.

&gt; I've never noticed that.

If you get the chance to touch it after its been running for a few
minutes I would appreciate it.....

&gt; As the fan gets older is will draw excess amounts of current until it
seizes
&gt; completely. It normally draws 6-7A at idle, hence the double rated fuse.

This is I think the sign of a dying fan......hence me going from 10A
to 13A to 20A.....Umm I could ofcourse test the amps being drawn
usiing a multimeter.....I'll do that now.


&gt; Junkyard is the best bet for replacement as the NOS fans seem to have dried
&gt; up (cip1 was the last source I knew of a couple of years ago).

Bugger......lets hope the sustained current is 6-7A

&gt; When you rotate the squirrel cage by hand, you should feel some resistance
&gt; but it's not rubbing, it's the magnets inside. Any kind of noise is
&gt; unwanted.

Its not that noisey but its not that quiet.....its a little stiff.....

Thanks for the info....

Charles
