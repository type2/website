Subject: Need Advice on My 77 Westy

Hello all,

I've been pretty much a lurker so far because, well, I haven't actually 
driven my Westy yet. Here's the scoop. It ran fine when I looked at it. Then 
I bought it, had it towed home (not because it couldn't be driven but because 
I was in NJ and it was in Philly and the city was about to tow it in their 
effort to clean up for the Republican Convention later this month... forgive 
me I digress!). So it was towed here. I have a knack for buying VWs that run 
when I look at them and then stop running as soon as they arrive here!

Anyway, I replaced the ignition switch (which was bad when I bought it), and 
then it wouldn't start. Turned over fine, just never caught. Then I went on 
vacation to the UK. When I came back there were stickers on it that it would 
be towed in 24 hours if not removed from the parking lot (condo). Not being 
able to start it, and new to all this, what did I do? I had it towed to the 
only local aircooled shop I knew of. 

They say the engine won't turn all the way and that I'm probably looking at a 
rebuild job. They seem like nice people, though I have no experience with 
them, but I'm hesitant to go the rebuild route because of the $$$--they 
haven't given me a price yet. They said they would pull the engine and try 
and determine the source of the problem and then give me a better idea of 
what I'm looking at. I'm going to talk to them tomorrow.

So, what should I ask? Is it reasonable that the bus ran fine, was towed 
here, I replaced the ignition switch, it wouldn't start, was towed there, and 
now needs a new engine?? I guess stranger things have happened when it comes 
to VWs :~)

Any advice appreciated. I really don't know what to do from here. I've 
started doing some work on my 65 Bug, but no engine work per se (well, I did 
pull the carb and replace it). Mostly brakes, fuel lines, etc.)

Thanks all...and hello to the other women on the list especially, it's nice 
to know we're out there too.
