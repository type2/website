Subject: need idle advice

I am having trouble with the idle on my 77 2.0 litre, man trans. At startup,
it will not idle.  I need to keep it running with the pedal until fully
warm...at which point the idle may or may not be right, depending on the
speed the bus decides it wants to idle.  It is occas 900, but if I throttle
it, idle stays at 1300 or (insert any number).  The idle screw changes
things minimally, but it is still variable.
I tested the intake air meter today per bentley and found 2 specs that
warrant replacing it. I have a used one that is in spec and I installed it.
Now the bus slows until it dies even if it is warm--unless I keep it going
with the pedal.
FWIW, all tune-up items are new, plus recent temp2 sensor, cold start valve,
thermo time switch. Aux air reg is in spec. Decel valve is not working
properly, but that shouldn't affect the ability to idle, right? No fuel
problems, can't find a vac leak, and I am stumped! Gap/timing/spark, etc
verified and reverified.
How to make a bus idle so it does not require three feet at the stop
signs??? Oh, it also takes a lot of turning at startup...NEVER EVER fires
the first time...not in the 11 yrs I've owned it. Installed the bosch relay
kit which didn't help.
Any help appreciated if this condition rings a bell with you!
Jay
