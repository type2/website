Subject: Re: [T2] Odd vacuum problem

The first thing that comes to my mind. Maybe where this leak is, the heat
expands the hose or the connection temporarily sealing the leak? That idea
is way out there though, as the vacuum system shouldn't have that much heat
in it. The plenum does sit close to the case though. Hmmm.

Subject: [T2] Odd vacuum problem

&gt; It appears I have a leak but as the engine warms up the leak goes away. If
I park for 30 minutes the engine runs fine next start but if I wait 4-6
hours it's back to running rough again at startup.
&gt;
&gt; Any clues why this leak seems to be temperature related?
