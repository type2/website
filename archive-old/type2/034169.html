&gt; The loop I used was about 2&quot; in diameter, maybe a bit bigger, so

&gt; no question. I put it in a loop because it looked like that would be
&gt; lower-stress than a straight run, but I may have erred.

Probably.  The &quot;5xRadius&quot; is simply a rule-of-thumb, and obviously a
larger radius will be better.  Don't be afraid to bend the metal line
if it will result in a better alignment with the fuel pump.

 I'll try
&gt; a straight run. Since I bought this bus as a glider with the former
&gt; engine
&gt; in a cardboard box, I don't even have previous work to go by :)
&gt; 
&gt; For general information, the parts book also shows a 'protector'
&gt; (plastic or rubber at a guess?) and a loop fitting to hold the
&gt; original 
&gt; steel line in place somewhere between the firewall and the fuel pump.
&gt; I know I don't have one, but I'm going to look for the screw hole it
&gt; should
&gt; have mounted to... maybe on the shroud? Seems like a good idea.

I've never seen one, but that doesn't mean that it didn't exist.  The
line is held pretty steady by the grommet and the rubber lines on each
end, so I don't think that another fitting is really needed.
