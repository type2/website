Subject: Window Scrapers

Hi there listees,

Does anyone know what difference, if any, there is between inner and
outer front door window scrapers on my '72 Westy?

I have a set of the inner scrapers in hand, although what I actually
ordered (and what I need to replace) is the outer scrapers.  But looking
at the old scrapers on my doors, the inner and outer look awfully
similar!  Note, though, that I have *not* taken anything apart, so I
can't tell if there are differences out of sight below the edge of the
window.

I'm tired of water going down the window and into my doors... I really
don't want them to rust from the inside out :-(

As always, thanks for your help...

-chad
