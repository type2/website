Bill,

If you look under engine then cooling air control you'll see the
illustration you are looking for. The thermostat is under the left lower
heat channel. Quick check, if the thermostat is puffy when cold then its
bad. These are sealed and when they heat up they expand (some gas inside,
air probably good question). When the engine heats up the thermostat gets
hot and opens then the cable lets the flaps open to allow air to blow via
the fan.

Subject: [T2] how does fan/thermostat work?


I have a 78 Bus I am trying to finish up and get on the road. This is my
first aircooled having owned several
water leaking vanagons. I was trying to locate my thermostat and can't
find it. I looked at the rod connected
to the flapper where a half in piece of cable is clamped to. I also
noticed these flappers(what do they do)don't move much.How does this all
work?Does it help with heating up,keeping the engine cool?Any one have
pictures of the thermostat set up? I have two new thermostats already.
What brackets cables do I need?Any info greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Bill
