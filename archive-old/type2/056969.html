&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  Greetings...
&gt;  
&gt;  I have recently installed an oil temp gauge in my 71 camper.  Upon driving
&gt;  it, I have noticed the oil temp reaching 250 deg. while driving on the
&gt;  highway...  
&gt;  
&gt;  Yikes!!!
&gt;  
&gt;  As far as I know, there are no calibrations necessary for an oil temp
&gt;  gauge, so I presume my oil temp is really that high..  First check is the
&gt;  thermostat, to see if I'm getting air flowing over my cylinders...
&gt;  
&gt;  Pull of the right, underside tin to reveal... (drumroll please)...
&gt;  
&gt;  No Thermostat!!!
&gt;  
&gt;  Yep, whoever rebuilt the engine before I purchased it forgot this little
&gt;  nicety.  There is nothing on the stud where the thermostat should be
&gt;  mounted, and as far as I could tell, no way for the fan flaps to open
&gt;  (obviously).  
&gt;  
&gt;  Now I am not able to see the air control flaps when I take off the curved
&gt;  tin (which makes me wonder if I've got the correct tin), but I was
&gt;  wondering if it made more sense to install a thermostat, or to fix the air
&gt;  flaps in the permanently open position?  
&gt;  
&gt;  I wasn't able to get a good view of the flaps and the manuals (haynes,
&gt;  bentley, or muir) don't really have a good diagram of the way this cooling
&gt;  system operates, so I'm not entirely sure what's involved with installing
&gt;  a thermostat.
&gt;  
&gt;  The main question, is:  under normal circumstances, do I need to remove
&gt;  the engine to install a thermostat?
&gt;  
&gt;  As far as I can tell, the engine hasn't suffered any adverse effects from
&gt;  this overheating, but it is naive of me to think that I can get away from
&gt;  this problem for much longer...
&gt;  
&gt;  Any advice is appreciated...
&gt;  
&gt;  Thanks...

Hi Tom,

Yes 250F is on the high side for your oil temps.

Yes there is no calibration required but if you have a dip stick sender then
do the following test.

With the engine running (to achieve normal operating voltage) put the dip
stick sender into some boiling water the gauge should read 212F this will
check the accuracy of the system which may be wrong for the reasons below...


On my camper if I turned the head lights on the regulator would compensate by
increasing the current and droping the voltage and &quot;hey-presto&quot; the oil temp
would go up by 3C (5F).
This is because you are not measuring the the temperature directly but are
interpolating it from the varying voltage drop due to the change in resistance
of a heated thermo-couple; so the following can be considered.

the causes of low voltage (and hence a high gauge reading) can be 
1. bad electrical connacts in the sender gauge system - including a bad earth
from the gauge.
2. a bad battry taking too much charge out of the system.
3. a bad alternator/dynamo not producing enough to adequately power the
vehicle
4. a leakage of current anywhere in the whole electrical system - sufficient
to lower the voltage but not to blow a fuse.

Having said all of that if the electrical system is good and reading correct
temps then there must be something wrong mechanicaly.


So the thermostat - Yes it should be there it helps the engine warm up (before
the choke comes off) and the flaps help to direct the air to the hotest end of
the piston barrels. so the whole system helps with cooling too.

VW designed the system to fail-safe so if the termostat breaks or is removed
then the flaps should go to the max cooling position. You need to check this.

As you have a 71 then I assume a 1600 type 1 engine

Put your right hand around the back of the fan housing to find the cross bar
which joins the two sets of flaps together - it will be at the bottom of the
fan housing, below the intake hole for the fan.

If it is present then push it to the left it should spring back if it doesnt
spring back then the spring is missing and the flaps will close so you need to
wire the flaps to an open position.

If there is no cross bar then see if you can feel the cranks that control the
flaps
if they are present then the flaps will be closed - so rotate the cranks to
the left to open the flaps (4 cranks 2 each side) they should be wired into
this max open position.

If the flaps are there and you cannot succesfuly wire them open then the
engine should be removed and the fan housing taken off to remove the flaps
completely to ensure that the do not close again.

If its only the thermostat and a broken spring then look to replace the
missing parts from a swop meet.

Of course if you have no flaps at all and are driving at or below 60mph and
are still getting high temps then there is something else wrong.

1. do you have the correct amount of oil in the sump - too little ORTOO MUCH
will raise the oil temp (been there done that)
2. check the tappet clearences a loose exhaust tappet will not allow full
clearence of the hot exhaust gasses.
3. check the ingnition timing - is is set correctly  - an advanced ignition
will cause the engine to run hot (I boiled my oil and ruined the top end of
the engine with a grossly advanced ignition - thanks Dad)
4. have you got the correct spark plugs (correctly gapped of course)
5. have you tuned the carb correclty as a lean mixture will burn hot
6. is the valve that allows the oil to bypass the cooler when the engine is
cold missing or stuck open.
7. if you have a dual reliefe crank case then is the high oil pressure return
valve stuck open causing insuffifient oiling of the moving parts.


So if all the cooling system is all present/all missing/in a fail safe
condition and your standard maintaince as above does not get the temp down
whats next

Clean the inside of the engine to remove blockages - not too difficult as its
done with flushing oil get some at the auto store and follow the instructions.

If that doesn't work then you have to start looking for a problem

do a compression test - leakage of the hot gases into the crank case would
raise the temperature.

check the oil pressure is OK (does the idiot light come on when idling?) do
you need to replace the oil pump?

The flushing oil should have cleaned the oil cooler but remove it and back
flush it under pressure.

If the oil temp still isn't down then either rebuild the engine now or
disconnect the gauge, join the AAA and start saving for a new engine which you
will fit after the AAA have towed you home :-)

Any way I hope you find one of the easier soloutions to your problem

Good luck
Bob
