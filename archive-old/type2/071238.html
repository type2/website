I'm not sure you could get enough excess gas to thin the oil passed the rings
and still keep the engine running. I'm sure some one will let me know on that,
but you might check the fuel pump. I'm making the assumption that with carbs
you have a mechanical fuel pump. A leaky diaphragm could send gas pouring into
the crank case instead if the fuel lines. I'd check there,
