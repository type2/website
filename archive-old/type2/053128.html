Subject: Gas mileage

Hello List,

 I took my 82 Westy on her first long run this past weekend and I wonder if
the gas mileage is average or not. My bus has a stock 2.0l with fuel
injection, running 20W50 Castroil,
just had the new head installed 2 months ago, and it got a tune up while in
the shop. I got 16.5 to 17 mpg, driving down a fairly level hiway. I could
maintain about 65 mph, which is what I like to cruise at.  I checked the
archives and it seems that on the hiway, I should get 22-25 mpg. On my old
73, I got 19 mpg with a 1800 with a single Weber carb.

 So am I panicking, or should I be getting better gas mileage??
