Subject: Re: [T2] Belly Pan Question

From: &quot;Dave C. Bolen&quot;

Over the years, this has been discussed and I think the consensus was that
belly pans went on all busses that had part of the roof cut out...to help
stiffen the frame.

Obviously, a westy should have a belly pan unless it has an A/C.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In that case I might be looking for a Belly Pan if I remove the AC. Anybody 
out there that can throw a stamp on one and send it to me;)?

Thanks,

Michael Knight
