&gt;So, if I go all-out, like I usually do, where would I put the
equalizer/amps?? I am also planning on installing a complete entertainment
system in this thing (TV, VCR, and video game package) like on the newer
vans. Do I need a larger alternator/battery??

If time/money is no problem, build a custom console for between the seats
and house all the electronics in there. Or check the law enforcement/EMT
equipment catalogs. They have all kinds of custom mounts and consoles for
UHF/VHF accessories and shotguns and such. Add up your amps for all the
accessories. Have the alturnator rewound and enhanced for extra amps, which
again will require no time problems to search and find someone who knows
how and no money problems to pay for his custom skills.
