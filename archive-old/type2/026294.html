&gt; Laurin J. Schmidt, sed :
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone diagnose my problem?  My 77 withnewly rebuilt engine has 20
&gt; feet
&gt; on it (0 miles) and I cant get it to go any farther. I am told to keep the
&gt;  rpm up initially. This can be accomplished after 3-4 starts-and-dies if I
&gt;  really beg it and almost over-rev it. Otherwise the thing rev's down and
&gt;  dies on its own.
&gt; 
&gt; do you still have the fuel injection system installed, sounds like either
&gt; a vacumn line off/miss run or the failure/disconnected cold start, thermo
&gt; time switch problemp
&gt; 
&gt; Bob
	[Crick, Bill [KAN:0W40-M:EXCH]]  If FI it sounds very much like a
missing vacuum hose.
	A big one like brake booster, or Decel valve. Listen for &quot;whoosh
whoosh whooo&quot; like sounds just as it turns
	the last time or two when it stops and then rocks back part of a
turn
	.This is you pistons sucking you are hearing through an open intake
system

&gt; 
&gt; Hello to all of you!
&gt; 
&gt; My name is Jenny and I am the co-owner of the Westhaus Garage (the other
&gt; co-owner is my husband, yannick). many of our client e-mailed and called
&gt; us to let us know their was a lot ok talking about us in the mailing
&gt; list, concerning the &quot;link' located at the bottom of our web page. Since
&gt; we are very (and i mean it!) busy having fun repairing westies, we don't
&gt; have much time to read every digest every day. But from what I have been
&gt; told, I guess I have some explaining to do.. ;0)
&gt; 
&gt; We opened this garage almost a year ago (June 1st!). About 6 months
&gt; agon, a good client of our offered us to create our own web page. So he
&gt; did, giving us a little space on his own web page (I suppose you would
&gt; call him &quot;a host&quot;). This client has a lot of family in the Kosovo area
&gt; and I guess the war really affected him. But HIS beleives ARE NOT ours!
&gt; Period. It might seem stupid but I really thought people would make a
&gt; difference between a personnel page and a commercial site. I don't have
&gt; to tell you that I now know that I was deeply wrong.... Obviously, somme
&gt; people think that we (including all french-canadians!) are racists and
&gt; etc...
&gt; 
&gt; Just like I said, we DO NOT share HIS opinions. They have NOTHING to do
&gt; with us or our garage!! We are just ordinary people working on the
&gt; coolest and funniest vehicule on earth. As bus owners (we have a 71
&gt; Sportsmobile and a 79 bus), we like too much people and traveling to
&gt; worry about politics and/or frontiers of any kind.
&gt; 
&gt; I will do something about this link tonight... and if you have any
&gt; questions about this issue, please, feel free to contact us. We'll be
&gt; happy to clarifie this situation.
&gt; 
&gt; Peace (and excuse my poor english!)
&gt; 
&gt; Jenny (and Yannick)

&gt; 
&gt; Hey all.
&gt; I have read the archives, there isn't that must recent there about poptop
&gt; canvas replacement. Has anybody shopped for this lately? I'm redoing a 71.
&gt; Any inputs on best price and quality? Ron, plan any specials in the near
&gt; future? I'm like broke but the weather in SC is wonderful..Camping HO!!!
&gt; Any input is appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Plus as an added bonus another question. Ever use paint stripper for
&gt; fiberglass? Picked it up at HOME D*POT. Before I melt the gel coat any
&gt; tips?
&gt; 
&gt; Friday is almost here, Thank GOD and everything VW.
&gt; TIA

&gt; &gt; &gt; Faced with the problem of locating the correct mark on an unknown T4
&gt; &gt; &gt; engine, I offer the following advice:
&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; On the scale, as far as I know, the T4 used only one from 72-83, and
&gt; VW
&gt; &gt; &gt; still sells them!  Which is nice because my engines tend to eat them
&gt; :-(
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The 72-74 type 4 motors (and maybe slightly later) had really nice METAL
&gt; &gt; timing scales with white backgrounds and numbers painted on, so if you
&gt; &gt; see a 72-74 bus being parted out that's a nice part to rescue!
&gt; 
&gt; unfortunately after cleaning one up, I found they do not fit on a later
&gt; model T4,  probably Fuel injection was when they changed to the black
&gt; plastic.
