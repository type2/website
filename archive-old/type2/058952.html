Subject: chnge dem points ben

 Ben,


&gt; I just heard that letting a bus sit with the ignition switch on, but
&gt; without the engine running (listening to the radio, etc) can burn up
&gt; your points!?
&lt;&lt;Yes&gt;&gt;
&gt; I've been trying to track down the cause of a really strange surging
&gt; idle and a loss of power overall and a mechanic friend asked if that
&gt; might be the problem.
&lt;&lt;Install new points and condensor, or buy a pertronix ignitor which
eliminates the points/condensor. Then adjust the timeing&gt;&gt;
&gt; Is replacing the points a tough thing to do? Anybody got any helpful
&gt; hints?
&lt;&lt;If I can do it,,you can! Unclip the holddowns on the cap.
Lift the cap up over the rotor, carefull to not to pop the spark
plug wires off, you dont want to lose track of where they go
on the dist. cap. Slide the rotor up and off the shaft.
You are now looking at your &quot;point set&quot; which is the
assembly that looks like part spring part electricle thing.
There is one screw that holds the points in place. Take it out.
OOpps! dropped the screw, eh! Take the little magnet that you had glued
to a small dowel before you started all this and fish it out.
Pull the point set out and disconnect it from condensor connector.
Now install the new points useing the above in reverse,,,this includes
dropping the screw unless you are real talented!
  If you look at the metal shaft you will notice that it isnt round but
kinda sorta square with rounded corners. when you set your gap
make sure that the part of the point set that rubs on the shaft is on
a low spot. the points contact on the high points and open on the
low points of the shaft. You can get the rub block to a low point buy
hand
turning the engine via the fan/belt...just make sure it's in nuetral.
  Make sense? Go for it and be patient on your first try. If it doesnt
run
on the first try just go back in and re-gap the points. It took me about
three
attempts...ok 4, to get the thing running again on my first points
change.
