Subject: [T2] Checking for Electrical Problems

Greetings List,

After reading several posts concerning suspected electrical problems
(especially FI busses) I would like to offer the following suggestion.  I
have used this method to trace and correct electrical problems on my FI bus
on a couple of different occasions.   

Take a 15 ft piece of 18 gauge or so wire and connect small alligator clips
to both ends.  Attach the wire to a voltmeter which you should already have
(or purchase for less than $20) and run the wire all the way to the
dashboard.  Ground the black negative wire on voltmeter near the dash and
hook the red wire to your 15 ft wire via the alligator clip.  Place the
voltmeter on the dashboard or some place where you can easily and safely see
it while driving.  The other end of the 15 ft wire can be run through the
engine compartment hatch (late busses) or out the back hatch and through the
engine hood (pre-72  busses).  You can now connect the wire to anything in
the engine compartment to test while driving the bus.    I have found shorts
in my fuel pump and also my double relay that would only occur while driving
and producing a lot of vibration on the road.  In both cases I could never
get the electrical shorts to rear their ugly little heads while sitting in
my garage.  You could test either side of the coil, fuel pump, or whatever
with this simple procedure.  Most shop manuals will tell you what the
readings should be and you can simply test to see if your readings are
close.  Problems are especially obvious if you have large spikes or erratic
readings on the voltmeter while driving.

Good luck,

Randall and Kermit the Bus (The lean, green, mean machine)
