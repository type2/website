Subject: Re: [T2] A Few Questions

&gt;Thanks to everyone who responded on the GL4 question. My local NAPA doesn't
&gt;have it. I'm going to be in the Detroit area the next couple weekends and
&gt;you can bet I'll be calling around to see if anyone has it up there!

David -

I finally had to get mine in a self-supplied can from Steve's VW (or Steve's
Automotive?), west of Pontiac, a block south of M-59, I believe on Elizabeth
Lake Road.  Good shop.  Man that stuff is hard to find.

I have his card at work.  If you can't dig up his phone number, email me at
jhartranft_at_ssoe_dot_com and I'll send it back to you.
