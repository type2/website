&lt;&lt; &quot;&quot;Now, a 73 transporter isn't an AC, so my analogy isn't ideal either.
But it's a tad closer than yours.&quot;&quot;

I thought AC was for AirCooled. HUH?
 &gt;&gt;

AC can trace it's history back to 1901 in Merrie Olde England...The
original cars were named Autocarriers, but it was shortened to an
AC inside a circle in 1907...The AC Cobra was an AC Ace aluminum
(or aluminium ;-) body and a Ford 289 eng. and trans...Caroll Shelby
presided over the marriage and the Rip Chords did the music... :-)

If you're into name changes, BTW, Jaguar was SS before WW II
(Swallow Sports or Standard Swallow) but the SS was not a good
choice of name for anything when the letters also appeared on 
black Nazi uniforms... :-( 

Tony in NJ (Who drove a 289 and was taken for a very quick ride
                  in a 427...A car with no reason to exist besides a de-
                  sire to be over THERE before anybody else... 8-)
