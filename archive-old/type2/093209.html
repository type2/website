&gt;I've been looking through the archives and bently and cannot find enough

&gt;and use the 72 tranny?

I'm not going to say that it won't fit, because I haven't tried it.  What I 
WILL say is that from looking at it, I don't think it would fit very well 
if at all.  I would keep the '72 tranny, bellhousing and starter and use 
the 215mm flywheel and clutch from a '74-75 bus with the '78 engine.  In 
fact, that's equivalent to what is in my bus now.  A very nice combo, I 
think.  Of course, you will also need an electric fuel pump that is 
designed for carburators since the '78 engine does not have the hole in the 
side for the fuel pump driveshaft.

I have tried a '78 tranny with the 2-liter engine using the '72-74 
bellhousing/starter/flywheel/clutch.  It fits but it's a tight squeeze - 
uses up all of the &quot;slop&quot; in your mount points and the upper rear tranny 
mount will even have to flex a bit to make it work.  I was uncomfortable 
with this for the long term so I had the stock tranny rebuilt and put it 
back in.  Now everything fits perfectly again.
