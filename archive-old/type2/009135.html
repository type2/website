Is your shift linkage adjusted correctly? I recently took out the drivetrain
and put it back in (and out again then in again) and I found it really hard
to get 3rd-2nd gear changes, before I readjusted the linkage (the plate 
under the carpet at the front).

If your clutch doesn't bit too much (and it shouldn't even if new) then you
don't NEED to match revs, unless you're changing gears without the clutch - 
have you checked this out, ie. adjusted the wing nut to spec, etc? The reason
I took out the drivetrain was because my clutch was dragging (ie. wouldn't
disengage). Maybe you have the same problem? For info, it was traced to a
faulty gearbox oil seal, which contaminated the clutch, which makes it go
funny.

RE:	downshift strategy

I own 3 acs and have trouble downshifting into second on all three.  I've
read here on the list that one should rev the engine to facilitate this
downshift.  My question involves the target rpm for such a rev. Is one
trying to match some rpm exactly?  Or is it enough to get the rpm above
some value?

thanks, Jack
