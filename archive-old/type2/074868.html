Subject: Admin: Re: [T2] Adm. Any Ideas

Bus content?  I think Sean already mentioned something about this, and 
very recently.  I would like to think that we are all intelligent human 
beings here, and can understand why we must refrain from discussing 
viruses (virii?), Microsloth Outlook and other non-bus topics on the 
TYPE 2 list.  Okay?  Okay.  Deep breath, let's proceed.

p.s. If you don't want to get a virus, GET RID OF OUTLOOK!  It smells 
bad!  Use Eudora (http://www.eudora_dot_com) instead.

&gt; I don't think its her fault just bad luck!
&gt; I suspect the subjects are picked up from MS Outlook Email and Address
&gt; Books.
&gt; I think that if we all cleaned out our E-mail boxes and deleted all our
&gt; addresses we could kill this cycle, but there are no guarantees.
