Subject: Update On the Free Bus

Well, I tore into the engine, and as expected it was a mess. When I popped off
the 1-2 valve cover, there was no pushrod on the intake for #2. When I split
the case, I found the pushrod and lifter in the bottom of the case, as well as
a cam lobe! The cam shaft had broken in two. Two pistons, the jugs, the cam
and crank, and of course the case are destroyed. The number 2 rod was bent and
broken into several pieces. I have to believe this was not a sudden and
unexpected failure-my guess is the guy kept driving long after noises from the
engine would have told a person of any sense to shut it down. Dozens of small
bits of metal in the bottom of the case. On the upside, the interior has
cleaned up nicely, and I'm really leaning toward getting this bus back on the
road if the title issue can be resolved. I really like the interior on this
Westy. If I can't get clear title, I may switch parts of the interior over
into my '77. I've also heard for years about a seal that goes around the
inside of the jalousie windows, and today I found this Westy has them- never
seen them before. I have pictures posted of the destroyed engine parts, as
well as the case with a big hole in it. Follow the link below, then the free
bus link at the bottom. Sorry- it's a freebie Geocities page, and will shut
down temporarily if too many hits.
