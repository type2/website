&gt;does anyone have a seat belt for the middle of the back seat for a 70

For a cheap solution, I'd suggest looking at wrecking yards for a middle
belt.  I'd avoid a donor bus with obvious collision damage, in case the
belt has been stressed and damaged.

Your safest bet would be to purchase a new unused middle belt, of course.
I'm sure there's a list vendor you could help you out with that.

IMPORTANT: with an infant (or any child not old enough to use belts alone,
or belts with a booster seat--and I'm talking *booster* seat, not a kids
car seat) it is imperative you use the seat in conjunction with a tether
strap.

Unfortunately, buses don't have built-in tether strap anchors as modern
cars do.  As I see it, here are basically two solutions to this:

1) drill a whole in the rear deck, at a place where the hole will pass
through one of the reinforcing members that run under the ceiling of the
engine compartment.  Use big bolts, big washers, big everything.  This will
work, will provide the restraint required for your child's safety, but does
involve an ugly  (and irreversable) hack to your bus.

2) What I did was have a tether anchor plate custom fabricated out of heavy
guage stainless steel.  The plate fit neatly under the rear cargo door
striker plate, with a tongue that extended into the cargo area. The seat's
tether strap attached to the tongue.  The cargo door was still able to open
and close normally without obstruction.  I hope you can picture this.  On
the downside, the strap runs the length of the cargo area, effectively
bisecting it left and right as far as cargo-carrying is concerned.  I
figure, c'est la guerre.  On the plus side (and a big plus) you don't have
to modify or damage anything on the bus--just unbolt the striker plate,
insert the tether anchor plate under it (like a shim), and re-attach.  It's
a solid set-up, as the thing is held in place by not one but *two* bolts
which bolt directly into a strong part of the bus (the reinforced part just
under the cargo door), and the load in an accident will be nearly
horizontal anyway since the angle of the strap is so shallow because the
anchor is placed so far back.  In fact, you may need to purchase an
extension for your seat's stock strap.  If you can't find an extension at a
car seat specialist retailer, try an outdoors outfitter as they have seat
belt material for sale by the foot in various widths.

I had my anchor plate custom fabbed by a shop that does all the tooling for
spacecraft and space robotics applications at the University.  They did it
for me for free, 'cause they thought it was a cool (and worthwhile)
application, and it was probably nice to work on something that'd be used
on the ground for a change.  ;-)

If other folks have come up with different solutions, it'd be great to hear
them.  I know a lot of folks on this list have kids in car seats, so it's
an issue a lot of us have been dealing with.

Happy camping (with kids)!
