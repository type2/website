&gt;&gt; I wonder  how they handle the differential heating of the  heads?

&gt; hey George  the only problem I have had with mine is getting the rings  to
&gt; seat. Doesn't seem to run hot at all, I am using a doghouse oil cooling  system
&gt; on mine . The best thing about these is that everything is stock VW. the
&gt; manifolds are stock dual port ends that you cut, block  and weld an  addapter that
&gt; comes with the kit to. The cam is a really neat as it has double  lobes so
&gt; that the thing pumps every stroke.  Later  mark  Dearing


I wasn't so worried about overheating as I was about the fact that one
side of the head is being heated by combustion, while the other is being
heated a lot less by pumping air.

This is just academic speculation, though.  Obviously these compressors
are working and working well.  Very elegant adaptation of existing
hardware.
