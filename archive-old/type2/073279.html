Subject: Would you?

Hi All,
I'm contemplating the purchase of a 1978 Westy. The owner is a friend of
mine who bought it a few years ago and drove it some 5400 miles in one big
stint and then parked it. No rust, new paint, new canvas pop top, just had
it smogged in CA. He's asking $3000 for it.

Here's the snag it has this curious habit of consuming oil. To be clear it
doesn't SEEM to burn oil (doesn't blow smoke, doesn't even leak when
parked). It just eats a quart or so every 300-500 miles.

It's had this nasty proclivity since my friend acquired it. As he was
driving all over the country at the time it made him a bit nervous at
first. En route he took it to three different mechanics who couldn't really
figure it out. He says a VW guru in Moab CO told him just to keep putting
oil in it. Said he'd seen this kind of thing before. Suggested that putting
in really heavy weight oil might solve the problem. As my friend was on the
last leg of his tour he never got around to trying this suggestion.

Considering these facts is $3000 a reasonable price? The Bus is really
clean, runs well, original plaid upholstery. Doesn't have the stove/frig
package though just sink.

Should I kill the deal on principal over the mystery of the disappearing
oil? Worst case what's the going  rate on a rebuilt motor.

Final consideration I have to travel from Colorado to California to pick up
the beastie.

Give it to me straight. I can take it.

Regards,
