Subject: re: CB radios

OK you old Hams (Isn't that redundant?),

It is time that I buy a new CB antenna anyway, I don't think that my
very old loaded-coil Antenna Specialists antenna is doing its thing as
well as it should. Since CB radios are considered de classe, I am
embarrassed to ask you guys, but what is the current hot brand? (Over 20
years ago, a Ham told me to buy an Antenna Specialists antenna).

I don't have room for the six-foot Firestick. Is there anything else a
bit shorter? And please point me to a URL where I can buy the durn thing
on the Web. We don't have any decent CB shops in the San Francisco Bay
Area, and I am not going to ask at HRO.
