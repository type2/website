Subject: Battery Tray

I assume that the proper way to replace ones battery tray that is rusting is
to remove the battery/motor/i.e. &quot;stuff in the way&quot;, and then get in there
with a grinder and mechanically grind all the crud out, then depending on
preference, clean the surface of finger print oils and such and then weld a
replacement tray in, clean surface to clean surface, then of course comes
the array of preferences on surface prepping/painting.

Can this job be done without dropping the motor?  I'm not really interested
in doing a quick and dirty pop rivet job that leaves the rust and nastiness
in place, but there isn't much clearance between the battery tray and the
heat exchanger below.  Anybody with some good/bad advice or some funny
little battery tray swap out anectdotes?
