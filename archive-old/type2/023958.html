Hi and THANKS to everyone that has helped me in the quest to getting my 78 bus running.  Just one problem, its still not running.  It turns over and gets fuel but will not start, not even a putter.  I've tried a bunch of stuff, such as testing the FI, Starter, seloniod, distributor, spark plugs, combi-relay, compression test(on a cold engine) and some other smaller stuff.  Actually, My next step is to check the ignition switch. 
 
My Question is;  Could my problem be valve related??Could the valves cause the engine not to start?? The engine sounds ok.  No odd noises, grinding or loud pops.  I'm not sure what I should try next.   Does anyone have any idea how to fix this problem????  Please help!!  Thanks Mike.
