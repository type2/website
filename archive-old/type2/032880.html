Subject: So Cal Christmas Toys

Folks,

I threw out the idea that doing a toy run in So Calif might be a great
&quot;reason&quot; for a get together.  We could start in some parking lot and end at
a Park or something.  Have a BBQ and just get together.

What response did I receive.  One.  I know I didn't post it on a Friday and
it has been suggested that some folks didn't want to raise the ire of the
Admins, which is really great and does serve to keep the list dedicated to
the cause of maintaining our busses.  But, it is Friday and I was wondering
if there is any interest in doing this?  It could be a good first meeting
for those in So Calif.

I have found that it's always a great feeling to do something for somebody
else during this time and there are so many kids out there that aren't going
to get much.  I went in Toys R Us the other night and found there are a lot
of the currently very popular Pokemon items for about $5.00.  Go big and you
can get an action figure of somekind for $7.00, and for $10.00 you can get
the kid the world.  Plus we can meet, have a BBQ compare bus
experiences...just have a great time.  What do you think?

P-mail me if you don't want to put your response out there.
