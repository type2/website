Subject: RE: [T2] Small Problem

Yup,
it used to happen to us all the time in Ketchikan and Kodiak,..
especially Kodiak, where everything gets super icy.  In any event,
having nicely machined drums and new pads in the rear doesn't mean
diddly when the wind is blowing at 40 to 50 mph and there is 6 feet
of snow and ice on the ground.  Parking the bus in that weather with
the E brake on would always ensure that a member of my family would
be out there with a rubber mallet knocking on the drum with cold
fingers and even colder steel.

We just learned to park it in gear when the weather got really foul,
and to only use the E-Brake when the weather was a little more
amicable.

I'm pretty certain that this is a normal hazard for drum brakes in
general.

On the other hand,... when it gets super duper cold, you don't have
to worry about a radiator or radiator hose bursting either.  For
years as a kid I never understood why all of the other cars in the
parking lot had to plug their cars in to warmers when it got bitter
cold, but we never had to worry about it.....   and then there was
also the obvious fact that our bus was extremely sure footed on snow
and ice when the other muscle cars of that era were spinning and
sliding and going to snow tires much earlier than we ever needed to.

Soooo,.. don't sweat the small stuff and try not to keep your
E-brake on in cold weather.  Same rule applies for Buses that are
going to be sitting for a long time.  If you don't set the E-brake
you wont freeze up your breaks with rust/ice.  If it will be sitting
for awhile, leave it in gear and block the tires.  Or better yet,
get it off the ground and on stands if you are going to let it sit
for awhile.
