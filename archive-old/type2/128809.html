Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Pressure Light on- advice needed

Well you are a lucky SOB. 

When the light comes on it is intended to mean you have little or no oil pressure. This usually is followed in just a few seconds with a major and catastrophic engine failure... 

You can have an engien that is full of oil but without oil pressure the bearings seize quickly. 

We tried puncturing an oil filter on an otherwise good Fiat engine one time. It lasted 30-40 seconds until it seized. Longer than I expected but it was unrepairable... 

That light is an on or off warning light. If it is changing brightness then you have additional electrical issues. 

You can be low on oil and make pressure. Our Fiat engine had oil pressure until the oil was so low it would not get picked up by the oil pump. 

You need to get a &quot;real&quot; oil pressure guage on the engine (screws into same place as the pressure switch). 

I bought my gauge from the local Co-Op, a bit of oil line (or fuel line or whatever you've got) and the barbed fittings from the local haredware store... 

May not be accurate but at least it will be +/- 5 psi. I think mine is better than that.
