Subject: RE: Child Cot

[...] I would suggest that maybe your daughter was too light for the design.
Our daughter was about 5 when we got our '71 Westy and, until she outgrew
the cot, we never had any problems.  Her weight kept the canvas tight
preventing the poles from coming out.  We always kept our luggage on the
front seats which reduced the drop in case of an accident.

&gt; Subject: RE: [T2] Child Cot
&gt; 
&gt; Many years ago we were camping with my daughter when she was one and
&gt; a half years old in our 71 Westy.  She woke up and started to crawl
&gt; around on the cot but not for long.  All of a sudden on of the one of
&gt; the poles slipped out from the latch on one of the pillars. 
&gt; Fortunately, she wasn't hurt as she landed on one of the seats.
&gt; 
&gt; If you examine the tabs on the ends of the poles you'll notice that
&gt; they aren't very long.  Doesn't take much shaking to cause them to
&gt; slip out.
