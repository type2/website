&gt; hi, I was just wondering if anyone knows weather a fuel tank and
&gt; exhaust from a 75 bus can go in a 78.  They both have stock 2.0's.  I
&gt; have alot to learn about the type 4 engine.  Everyone on the list have

tanks are two basic types, fuel injected and carb...fuel injected can be
swapped, carb tanks can be swapped but they are two or three different
sizes BUT I think all bay van tanks are only those two different types
