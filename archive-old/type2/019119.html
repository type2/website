In my  pre-list days, I had no idea where to go for VW bus help.
I didn't know anybody made a hitch for a bus so I set out to make
my own.  My dad used to own a welding shop where we built and
installed hitches so I kind of knew what I was doing.  But this
time I had to do it with a few hand tools instead of the nice
fancy shop tools.  I used a hack saw, vice, drill press, and a
1/2 inch drill.  The drill press made it easier, but it could be
done with only the 1/2 inch drill and a vice.
I estimate it cost me 40 bucks (With my bus, I only measure
money, I never measure time) to build the hitch; I don't remember
how much for the wiring stuff.  Anyway, I attached it to the 3
mysterious bolt holes in the rear body section of my 72.  I tried
every different size metric bolt I could find, but in the end a
3/8 bolt fit the best.  I still haven't figured out what the bolt
holes are really for.  My hitch is also supported by the bumper
mounting bolts.  My bumper is 1/4 inch lower now.
I built the hitch by hack sawing a bunch of metal, drilling
holes, then bolting it all together.  Kind of Erector Set like.
Afterwards, I removed it all and had a welding shop weld a bunch
of it together to turn it into a 3 piece hitch.  It probably
would have been fine without the welding but I wanted to be extra
sure.  All in all it's a very clean set up that fits the bus
nicely.
I've been towing a 16 foot Hobie Cat for three years now with no
problems.  I estimate the loaded trailer weight at 700 lbs and
the tongue weight at 75 lbs.  My manual say's the 72 can handle
1000 lb gross trailer weight and 100 lb tongue weight.  I guess
if there were no mountains or hills on this earth then that would
surly be true.
If anybody is interested I'd be willing to draw up some plans.
Of course, these plans would only work if other year busses had
those mysterious bolt holes in the rear body section or someone
was willing to drill holes in that area.  Anybody know what these
bolt holes are for?

Side note:  I actually went to a custom hitch shop first.  The
guy came out to my bus and the first thing he said was, &quot;I don't
think you can put a hitch on a VW&quot;.  Right after that he
said,&quot;It'll cost you about 250 to 300 bucks plus wiring
charges&quot;.  I thanked him for his time then drove home.
