Subject: Re: Timing - Rule of Thumb

&gt; 
&gt; With the engine AT IDLE, turn the distributor (advancing timing) until the
&gt; engine runs at its fastest...this point will be clearly heard...(the revs will
&gt; pick up to a 'peak' and then die as you over-advance).  Once you've found this
&gt; 'peak'  turn the distributor back at bit (about 1/4 &quot; retarding timing about 3
&gt; degrees).......
&gt; 
&gt; 
I've used this procedure, but I back off the distributor until the engine 
starts to cough a little then move it forward enough to stop the 
coughing.  This will keep the timing from being set too far forward and 
overheating the engine
