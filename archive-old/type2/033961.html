Re oil temps- I consider anything below 212 deg F as too low for the oil
temp- you gotta drive off the corrosive water vapors!  With 211,000 mi
on UNREBUILT engine, I average (in summer) 240 on the oil temp,
sometimes 260 on hard 75mph driving.  Now in outside temps of 45, it
gets just above 212 on the highway, but never goes above 140 if just in
town driving.

&gt; David,
&gt; In my 72 with 1800 P&amp;C's my head temp is about 220-290 F on the flat and level
&gt; _at_ 50 F outside.  It seems to fluctuate by about 25 degrees depending on if the
&gt; heater is on.  CHT goes up with heat on and down with heat off.  My oil temp
&gt; stays about 140 - 160 under the same conditions.
&gt; I've come to the conclusion that if my CHT stays below 350, I'm fine, and that
&gt; my oil isn't even working hard until it reaches 190.
&gt; I'm no temperature expert, but these are the temps I look for.
