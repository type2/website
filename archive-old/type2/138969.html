Herr Herr,

That's the order. You only want to adjust the valves once if you can help
it.

&gt; Also, I tried to get my bus started yesterday when the temps were in
&gt; the mid 20's and it idled really really rough, I'm hoping this will
&gt; improve once everything is adjusted properly, it just kinda surprised
&gt; me how much difference 15 degrees and some moisture in the air made
&gt; between my attempts on two different days.

Like Dave said throwout the old gasoline. Even if the gas doesn't smell
pungent change it anyway.
