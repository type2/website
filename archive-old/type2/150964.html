Subject: Re: [T2] oil cooler

Scott,
You have my interest, but I am concerned about clearance issues with the 
sandwich adapters. I don't know if they fit once the hose fittings are on. 
Last time I changed my filter I had a long look up there and things are 
pretty tight around the top of the filter. That's why I am putting the 
question to the list though. I hope to get as much info as possible so I can 
make an informed decision. Please do take a look at the adapter and let me 
know what you think.

&amp;gt; Tom,
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; You can use a sandwich plate adapter. It mounts between the oil filter
&amp;gt; takeoff and the filter. It has a crude thermostat built in, I think they 
&amp;gt; are
&amp;gt; made by mocal but the package says empi. I have one at our shop I can have 
&amp;gt; a
&amp;gt; look at tomorrow for the part number, and yes, you can still use a good
&amp;gt; filter, it will hang about 1&amp;quot; lower. 
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
