WOW!!!  Consecutive &quot;hot start&quot; posts!!!  This has to be a record!!!  not
just two in one day, but two consecutive posts!!

OK, both of you...

1) Go to www.type2_dot_com

2) click on &quot;Library&quot;

3) click on &quot;Electrical (Primary)&quot;

4) page down to &quot;Starter&quot;

5) the first article under that heading, &quot;Hot Starting Problem: Starter
   Relay Installation&quot; is what you  are looking for.

Certainly cleaning the contacts on the battery will help.  Cleaning the
ground strap connections (battery-&gt;body and body-&gt;transmission) will help,
but the relay is also (usually) necessary.
