Subject: intake gasget

fellow list volks: i have my old intake manifold off on the 68, and was
more than a little suprised to find no gasket that popped out. upon close
inspection and scratching at it, it looks like a copper ring that could
well be mashed so tight in there. if its a gasket as i hunch, how do folks
get it out? its pretty tight. will continued picking at it be a mistake?
otherwise having fun.
