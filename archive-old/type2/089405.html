&gt;The 1700 head  inside diameter is 87mm. Values:  40mm intake  35mm exhaust

1.7L Head  inside diameter is 100 mm, Valves 39.3 In X 33 Ex

&gt;the 1800 head inside diameter is 92mm.  Values: 39mm intake  32.07.... exhaust.

1.8L Head inside diameter is 105mm. Valves 39.3 In X 34 Ex ( FI Head )
( The Carb Head, same part #, has 41 In X 34 Ex , and one or two EGR holes. )

&gt;The diameter where the actual cylinder fit into the head was 105mm on each
head.

Ezackly. Don't know where you are getting those other #'s.

&gt;I looked, and there was no machining to the 1700 head it appeared. the
thickness of the head &gt;was proportionate  and all.  It was the 1800 head which
had been machined previously in it's &gt;lifetime though...

The 1.7L head has been flycut from 100mm to 105mm to fit the 1.8L  cylinder.

&gt;Next discovery, she isn't a 1700, but a 1800. Okay, Cool!  but now the funny
stuff... they did &gt;put a 1800 head (p/n 022 101 371 H) on the 1 &amp; 2 side, but on
the 3 &amp; 4 side, they put a &gt;1700 head.. (p/n 021 101 371 J)
&gt;Has anyone ever heard of this?  I checked, the 1700 was not bored out and the
1800 had &gt;previous seat damage to the #2 cylinder...


The best choice for big valves and carbs is 41 X 34 valves ,1.8 Carb Head.
Also a good choice for an upgrade to 2.0 L or 96mm Big Bore Kit .
The 2.0L FI Heads are too small valves for me. As you will see, the 1.7L
head has bigger intake valves than the 2.0L. ( 39.3 vs. 37.5 ).
