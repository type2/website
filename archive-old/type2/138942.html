&gt; May I solicit recommendations for good paint for my fresh from the

VHT hi-temp is already flat black contains ceramic and is rated for 1200F.
Assuming you can get it to stick it should be good for that use. It will
smell for a several hours after you run the engine until it's cured and I
would recommend following their heat cylcing instructions.

This is the only paint I've been able to stick to my muffler and make last.
