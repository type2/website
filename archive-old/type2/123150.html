&gt; So how would you remove a broken tap?
&gt; Help! How do I get this d*%$ thing out of there? Can't drill it with my 
&gt; ordinary drills, too hard. Rotary stone ala Dremel? (knowing full well the 
&gt; Dremel ain't really for REAL work... &lt;grin&gt;)
&gt; 
&gt; It's wedged in there pretty good!!!

the only way I have found to reliably get the _at_&amp;#*_at_ things out is to
break em up with a punch and hammer....not fun, WEAR GOGGLES, maybe 50/50
odds of damaging the hole too.  make sure all of the pieces are out before
trying to drill it over as the least little piece will booger the new
drill

good luck
