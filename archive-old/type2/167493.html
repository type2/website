&gt; Well, it's running a bit rich, but you have quite a bit of leeway on the
&gt; NO side so you might want to lean it out a few clicks in the AFM
&gt; (tighten the spring).  The EGR will also help keep the NO down as you
&gt; lean it out as leaning the mixture raises NO levels.
&gt;
&gt; Now, I am guessing that the AFM works the same way as on my 78.... I'm
&gt; sure someone else can confirm.


the screw on the AFM is backwards I believe from the other dials.

Right is Richer
Left is Leaner
