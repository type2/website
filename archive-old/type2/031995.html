Hi all:

Seems to be my time for asking lots of questions.

Took my new CV joints and bare drive shafts to a shop to have them 
pressed on.  (Should've just banged them on myself, but I was busy with 
other things.)

Anyway, the guy who put on the CV joints used the spring washer that comes 
with the boot kit, though none of my 3 manuals shows the spring washer 
being used in the Vanagon and the instructions that came with the kit 
make it clear that some applications use the washer and others don't.  

So, question 1): is this a big deal??  Should I insist the washer be 
removed?

The guy who put on the joints also put them on &quot;backwards&quot; from the way 
my old (original with car) CV joints were installed and &quot;backwards&quot; from 
the way they are shown in the various manuals' illustrations.  That is, 
there's a groove on the circumference of the CV joint near one of the 
flat faces; it looks like the cap attached to the rubber boot might 
&quot;snap&quot; into this groove.  But, this groove was installed AWAY from the 
boots in my original joints, and the illustrations indicate likewise.  
None of the manuals indicate any sort of orientation in the text, only 
the pictures.

So, question #2): any significance to this?   

TIA.
