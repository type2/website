Subject: RE: [T2] free 77---&gt; actually a 78!  bus Update

I re-read my E-mail, and must observe it sounded like
I was looking a gift horse in the mouth.  Sorry all. 
I'm very fortunate to have been given the opportunity
to keep this T2 alive, and I appreciate Matthew for
all of his work.  And, the new owner of the bus spent
time today cleaning the interior.  So she is showing
interest.
   
A free Camper bus, given to someone who has always
wanted a VW Camper, and in doing so, am keeping
another bus alive.  A good thing.  Don-cha think?
