Subject: Re: Looking for a High-top.

&gt; But you do realize that the slightest crosswind sends your poor bus into
the next lane with a
&gt; hitop, right?

Highs winds can make for a lot of work in a Hi-Top, but if you
steering/ball-joints are up to snuff I think this would be minimized.  I
normally cruise at 60 mph in calm conditions, and slow to 50 - 55 depending
on the winds.

&gt; You will have to cut the roof, if you plan to sleep up there.  There is
only about 17 inches of room with my set up.  If you planned
&gt; to save the cross arch and put a bed on the existing roof, that would give
you 14 inches. Not much room (like sleeping in a coffin)
&gt; Email me if you have any further questions.

You get a ton of extra space in a Hi-Top for storing light weight stuff and
you can stand up anytime.  It's handy for transporting odd-sized items and
gives a convenient spot to attach a retractable awning above the slider
door.  You can also add upper windows/roof vents for extra light and
ventilation.    My wife loves it.

My Hi-Top was a Get-Away conversion and has a humungous roof cut-out, larger
than a Westy.  We don't have a bed up top, just storage.  We also have a
unique removable wardrobe/stove/cupboard unit (stove/cupboard detaches for
more flexibility) which sits behind the driver's seat which take a lot of
gear while still leaving a lot of space.  The only items not put in a
cupboard on our last trip was the water jug and the Kool-Tron 12V cooler,
which sat behind the wardrobe.
