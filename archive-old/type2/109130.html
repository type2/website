&gt; While driving around the beautiful state of West Virginia, my accelator
begins
&gt; to develop a mind of its own.  When I take my foot off the gas, the bus
keeps
&gt; going along at a merry clip.  A friend calls it &quot;hillbilly cruise
control.&quot;

Steven-

My first bus (long ago) was a 68 Westy that decided to pull this same trick
in traffic one day. Never having dome so much as an oil change before, I
took it to a mechanic --at Kmart, no less-- and he found the problem right
away. Under the bus near the engine the accelerator cable housing had become
damaged and was pinching the cable. The spring wasn't strong enopigh to pull
the cable back though the housing, so I had an idle speed of about 30 mph.
We trimmed the end ogf the housing and I never had a problem with it again.

Just thought I'd add an easy solution you could check first.
