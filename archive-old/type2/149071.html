Subject: Re: [T2] ?SO-69 conversion?

Tina,

A '69 Westfalia would not have the head banger cabinet... it would
have a net instead.  The headbanger cabinet started in '70.

Take a look at this:

http://type2_dot_com/library/camper/westpics.htm

The first two pics are SO-69.  SO-69 is rare here, but more common in europe.

As for documentation on how to use the stuff... I don't know of any.
I suspect the fridge on an SO-69 would actually be an ice box... that
is easy to use, just put in a block of ice!  Not sure about the
stove... does your bus have a propane tank on it?  The cabinet should
have a small water tank in it... fill that up and start pumping the
handle for water.

Enjoy the westy!
