&gt;Normally these are lubricated with engine oil and (somebody tell me if 
&gt;I'm wrong) it is not necessary to do this in the case of a routine 
&gt;replacement of the top half of the fuel pump (the pump part).

Ken they mean in my estimation the bottom of the pump above the
plastic thing where the pushrod contacts the pump lever in the pump.
That's what I pack full.  Oil can splash up there but not a lot as the
fit on the plastic thing to rod is close and the gaskets are a close fit
as well on the rod.

&gt;In any case I did not want any newbies to go squirting grease into the 
&gt;brass part of a fuel pump. Do not do that. That would be a very bad 
&gt;idea. Daniel Winkert probably knew that perfectly well and is way ahead 
&gt;of me. =^)

That much is certain.  As to the first question about moly or wheel
bearing (lithium) I don't think it much matters.  You shouldn't mix though
and likely it was a multipurpose closer to the latter, not the moly before.
Not that it matters much if you replaced the pump, but if you just had
it off...  Now if it were a new motor I'd just use the same moly I'd been
using as assembly lube.
