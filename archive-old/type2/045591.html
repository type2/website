Subject: [T2] Re: Help, just bought my first bus

Volks- I had A/C in my bus when I bought it, but took it all out.
Interestingly enough, the vent was neither under the dash nor on the
ceiling. It was coming out of the cabinet behind the driver's seat. That
whole small closet behind the water holding tank was full of A/C stuff. I
took it all out and my wife thanked me for the extra space (we've been
traveling and camping all along the East Coast for three weeks now and
the bus is running great).
