If the shop is going to rebuild it, I believe the book calls for 13 hours 
labor out/rebuild/install. If they are not a vw shop, and just a general auto 
shop, they may not have access to the parts and prices we are used to seeing, 
more along the high end of retail as their cost, with a 40-50% mark up. I've 
seen this happen before, and while it doesn't sound right, to them it's fully 
justified. This can easily put the bill over 2k. Just make sure you have a 
written estimate before you have the work done, and aim for them installing 
someone else's engine if thier estimate is too high. Also find out(either 
way) which parts will be new, rebuilt/reman., or simply reused. Beware of 
locally rebuilt heads, they may just knurl the guides, and regrind the 
existing valves, giving you a head which may only last 10k. Good luck.     Ed
