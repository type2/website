Subject: Steering Wheel Smoke?

Hello!

Took my '70 campmobile out for a spin this weekend up to Winter Park, CO
area.  All went will - slow up the hill but made it without problems
over the 11,000 foot Berthoud Pass!!

This morning however, we were about 1 mile from the campsite and I
noticed smoke coming from where the steering wheel and turn signal
switch meet!!  While I was looking at that, my wife told me that the red
light on the dash (with a B in a circle) was flashing.  Sure enough it
was!  So i stopped the car - noticing that the light went off as soon as
I stepped on the brake pedal...

I unscrewed the turn signal switch and looked for signs of anything
burning but saw nothing.  Not having a clue what was wrong, I looked
under the car - all looked ok.

I paged through Muir and didn't find much - am I correct in assuming
that the light is the Brake Warning light?  Anyway, after several
minutes I did the old college try.  Started up fine - no light - no
smoke.  Headed on our way home - no more signs of anything.  I put the
turn signal switch back in.  Everything groovy all the way home.

Anybody have any ideas or suggestions?

P.S. Sticker idea - I'm sure everyone has seen the &quot;Share The Road With
A Bicycle&quot; stickers...how about &quot;Share The Road With A Bus&quot; ???  I've
been passed *ON THE RIGHT* of a 2 line highway, once too often.
