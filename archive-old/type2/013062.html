&gt; My question is- how does one trouble shoot bad gas mileage? Any 
&gt; suggestions
&gt; on where to look first, tests to run, etc. The wisdom of the list is
&gt; needed!!!! as always TIA TBear

Other things which may effect gas milage:

- improperly inflated tires
- bad alignment (i think)
- bad or going wheel bearings

I'm assuming your carbs aren't too rich...

I would say stick with the vacuum dizzy for fuel economy/heat reasons,
but that's just me...
