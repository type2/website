Wow!  That's unusual.

&gt;Went out to get replacement parts, and figured I'd get a clutch
&gt;(driven plate) as well, since the one that's in there is probably
&gt;close to 5 years old. The replacement I got (korean) has little springs
&gt;running concentric to the hub (that is, not radially, but the other way).
&gt;The old one (Sachs Brazil, I think -- Brasilian, anyway) does not -- just
&gt;rivets around the hub.
&gt;
&gt;Any difference? Ok to use either type?

Mine has the springs.  I'm sure it's okay to use that type.  If you used
the other one for 5 years, I'd say it's okay to use that type too.  :)

&gt;The old one looks surprisingly
&gt;good, btw...not visibly thinner than the new one. Are they all supposed to
&gt;have radial grooves when they're new? The old one doesn't, but it came
&gt;with the rebuilt engine 5 years ago, so I don't know if it did or not.

Mine does not have radial grooves, although clutch discs for other types of
cars almost always seem to have them.

&gt;If they are all supposed to have them, and they're a wear indicator, then
&gt;the old one is shot. :)

I bet your old one is good for another 5 years.  My current clutch disc has
9 years and over 50,000 miles on it, and it *still* doesn't show any signs
of wear other than a slight glaze which is normal.

&gt;If anyone has any spare positive karma, shoot some this way -- I'm fighting
&gt;off some general depression, and am not really psyched for the never-ending
&gt;battle against entropy right now.

Sounds to me like you're suffering from engine-out blues.  Get that bus
back on the road!  :-)

p.s.  As far as I'm concerned, clutch discs aren't subject to entropy
unless they are abused.
