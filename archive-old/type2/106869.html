Subject: Re: [T2] RE: T2 tune up question

Dave,

Ya know what relly works good for ths application as well as any other
you could possibly think of ?

GOOP

This stuff is more sticky than 3-M weather strip adhesive--and is oil
proof, water proof, and bullet proof--and won't come off--of anything

It's original intention was to repair the soles of gym shoe's--and will
repair or stick just about anything together.

Crazy stuff--

Later,

Terry

Richard, 
Had that problem with my socket too...I grabbed my favorite stuff(3m
weatherstrip glue) and just glued it back in...I don't think it has ever
come back out with a spark plug again. 
Shameless plug for yellow weatherstrip adhesive! LOL 
Cheers, dave

Just be sure whatever wrench you use, that the rubber gasket inside the
socket holds the sparkplug securely...Otherwise, it's magnet-on- a-stick

I've had back luck with spark plug sockets. My preferred tool vendor was
changing manufacturers and as a result their spark plug socket became
unavailable. I bought a crasftsman spark plug socket and I found that
the rubber inside gripped the plug to much and the socket stayed with
the plug when I tried to pull it out. I eventually found a better
fitting regular socket and put the rubber piece inside and tailored it
to my needs. With the engine tin in place the 6-sided top that most
spark plug sockets have doesn't really come use anyway. 
The hose technique is a good trick but I still don't like dealing with
plug #2 on a FI bus.
