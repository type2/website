drivers seat out and noticed a pull switchwith a
missing knob under the drivers seat on theright side
of thepedestal&lt;&lt;

That diverts the heater air from the front vents to
the rear passenger compartment. When pulled out, the
heated air comes into the rear area from a vent on the
floor right on the back side of the walk-thru section
of the floor between the front seats.
