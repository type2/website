&gt;I've got a '69 Westy and I can't figure out exactly how big the gas tank is.
&gt;The PO told me around 10.something gallons, which I know is wrong and
&gt;Bentley says it is 15.something gallons, but I don't think it is that big.
&gt;When my fuel gauge reaches the &quot;R&quot; at the bottom, how much is left in the
&gt;tank?  I filled up the other day when the gauge was just above the &quot;R&quot; and
&gt;it took 11.5 gallons.

I have the same question about a '71 Type 2.  Can't find
gas tank sizes anywhere. Anybody ?

Thanks,
