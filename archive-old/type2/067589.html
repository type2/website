Subject: M-Code in headlight bucket

One of the unknown M-Code's for my bus shows up in the right headlight bucket.

I pulled the headlights to install new seals and found &quot;SK1032&quot; written in
the right headlight bucket.  The code is written using thick paint or
adheasive.  It shows up as raised letters under the blue of the bus.

Has anyone else found a code in their headlight bucket?  Does it match an
M-code that you already know?
