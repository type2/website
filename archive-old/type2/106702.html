Subject: Re: [T2] strange oil temp sensor

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Check your ground connection on the oil temp gage. As others have said 
this is most likely a ground issue. To be sure I get a good ground on my 
gage they are on a different ground wire that runs directly to the place 
where the battery grounds to the frame so that I am sure I have a good 
ground for all my gages and they are not affected by things like the 
lights. If you have not done so consider running a dedicated ground wire 
for your gages to the place where the battery ties to the frame.

Good Luck,
