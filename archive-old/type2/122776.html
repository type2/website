Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Anyone using a B4 in their Bus

Hi Dave,

The BA-6 will fit fine under your bus, that is where they were designed 
to go. We have one installed in Franklin, my Dad's 75 westy.

It's not a simple install, but it will give excellent heat.

Happy trails,

&gt; I don't have heater boxes, I'm running an upright T4.  I did buy a BA6 
&gt; with
&gt; all the switches but thought it may be to big to go under the Bus.  
&gt; Sounds
&gt; like I'd better use the BA6 or opt for a SW under the back seat.  Have 
&gt; no
&gt; room in the engine compartment with dual carbs and second battery.
