The Bosch relay kit designed for  this problem works.  I have them on all my
VW's and have not had a problem with starting since.

&gt; ive had the same prob on all my VWs here in AZ. After a long hot trip:
click
&gt; click. The way I do it is to have a helper rock your bus forward and back
IN
&gt; GEAR, while you keep bumping the starter with the key at the point the
&gt; tranny engages and the wheels lock. Bus doesnt go anywhere, just rocking
&gt; basically. Takes a couple tries usually. The flywheel sort of &quot;frees the
&gt; starter&quot; if you will, so I know its heat related. Then when the starter
&gt; becomes operational and your bus stutters forward in gear due to the
starter
&gt; magically working, stop rocking, disengage the clutch and start it
normally.
&gt; Tried many different starters including self supporting in case there was
a
&gt; binding issue on the starter shaft..... No difference. I'm BANNED from
&gt; taking back my lifetime warranty starters at the local FLAPS. Tried 5
before
&gt; they told me to get lost. Im using new wiring, new starter, new battery,
new
&gt; tranny to ground-ground strap, new battery to ground-ground strap  -Still
&gt; locks.
&gt; This method sure as heck beats push starting for a mile in 120 degree
&gt; weather or getting underneath on the scorching pavement. Ive tried the hot
&gt; start relays, still doesnt do much except eventually blow the fuse on the
&gt; relay. I can &quot;bump free the starter&quot; by myself in a bug fortunately (foot
&gt; sticking out on the ground, rocking it back and forth). Will click all day
&gt; unless i bump it free. Maybe ill try the heat shield...never thought about
&gt; it.
