Hey Y'all,
  I am selling my 1970 Bus with a westy pop-top and Z-bed. It has a
1600dp with about 30k miles on rebuild, doghouse cooler, Alternator,
heater assist blower. This Bus is nice but needs paint and a little
TLC. It is currently used as my daily driver, so it runs great and
everything works. I have too many prodjects and one has to go. I am
asking $1000 but will take any resonable offer, please drop me a line I
want this to go to a good home it has a lot of potential.
