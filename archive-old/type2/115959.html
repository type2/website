&gt; I was making small talk at a function the other night with my boss's boss.
&gt; He a real Porsche fanatic.  The conversation drifted around to AC engine

&gt; considerably higher horsepower.  He replied that it used to be that one could
&gt; &quot;chip&quot; a 
&gt; Porsche engine.  But nowadays they were so built that one could no longer
&gt; &quot;chip&quot;.  I had no idea what he specifically meant by &quot;chip&quot; and so, not to
&gt; look like 
&gt; a complete idiot, I smiled and comiserated with him.
&gt; What does he mean by &quot;chipping&quot; an AC engine?  Anybody out there familiar
&gt; with this term?

I believe he's referring to replacing one of the logic chips in the Motronic
ECU. To alter the fuel mapping, etc.
