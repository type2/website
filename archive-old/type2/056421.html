Subject: fi conversion - trans

list,
Currently, FI to carb conversion issues discovered by myself have been - 
1. the throttle linkage will have to be modified
2. the coil needs to be switched out?
3. the heads may need to be switched out?
4. a low pressure electric fuel pump has to be installed
5. there is a vacuum line coming from the auto trans - can this affect shifting (someone is laughing at me - i can hear you!)? if so, how can i get this vacuum source back?

anything anyone else knows about this auto trans or future problems w/ a carb conversion would be appreciated...
thanks,
clark gordon
