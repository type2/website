----Subject: Cool Discovery: Easy Hydraulic Lifter Bleeding

---I'd like to pretend that I used my gigantic brain to figure this out,
but truth is that I just --stumbled upon a very easy way to bleed the
hydraulic lifters. I was doing the ----pan-full-of-oil thing, pressing
down on the lifter for 30 seconds to get maybe 3 or 4 --bubbles out of
it. VERY tedious and time-consuming.----snip----It took me 30 minutes to
bleed 2 lifters the old way; it took less than 20 minutes to bleed the
remaining six the new way----

I bled my lifers by using a small mechanical press - I put a pan of oil
in the press and built the lifer right there and used a type 1 pushrod
and pressed on it with the press.  Bleeding Took about 15 to 20 seconds
per lifter - try at your own risk - usual disclaimers apply - anyone else
try this tatic?  WARNING - lifters assembled this way have not been
tested in the engine yet
