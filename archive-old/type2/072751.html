If you have a Bentley, look at page 22, fig 4-24.  Are you sure its a three
prong plug?  The thermo-time switch plug is brown and in that area
(2-wire).  Are you sure its a '77.  The 76's EGR had a green (2 wire) plug
which was also in that area.  That also might explain your high idle.

Have fun

&gt;Hello All --
&gt;While I rooting around inside the engine compartment of my girlfriend's 77
&gt;bus trying to investigate a high idle problem (checking for vacuum leaks,
&gt;etc.), I found a loose wire back behind the #3 cylinder (that's the one at
&gt;rear left, right?).  The loose end has a small 3-prong plug, while the
&gt;connected end meanders down around and under the central area of FI
&gt;components -- I couldn't determine where it actually goes to exactly.  The
&gt;wire casing, although very greasy black, seemed to have a light brown or
&gt;tan color.  Does anyone know what this might be for and if/where I need to
&gt;reconnect it, and (a stretch) could it be FI-related and attributable to
&gt;the high idling thing?  (It doesn't idle high on start-up, just when warm
&gt;and been driving awhile.)  Thanks for any input!
&gt;
