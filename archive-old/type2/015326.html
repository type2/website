&gt;They come with one side porous and one side smooth. I've never figured
&gt;out which goes where, but just put the smooth side up to keep it from
&gt;absorbing oil that might blow out. Does anyone on the list really know
&gt;which is correct?

I speculate that the smooth surface is more resistant to soaking up
oil and water and therefore install that side down but I don't know
fer shur. That it is installed either way is the key to cool motoring.
