Subject: Re: [T2] Just added up the cost of parts that I want/need for
  my bus

From: Access Systems
&gt;first you NEVER add it up, because you can not afford it.

&gt;it is always just one part after another...only count the cost of the next
&gt;part you need
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plus you can't do it all at once unless you are a lucky SOB. Try to focus 
and get what you need to get started. Along the way you will be suprised 
what you might find for less than what you were going to pay for. Others 
have done this and sit parts they bought only to later rethink their 
strategy and find themselves with parts they could have spent the money on 
what they didn't think about or plan on changing.

TravelOn,
