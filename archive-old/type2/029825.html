Phil,

Nikki and I ran into a problem just like what you describe on that exact
window on her bus. I am sorry to say that some seals are just too thick
and will not go in. The window+seal should go into the opening and sit
such that the flap of the seal is up against the flange before you pull
the cord. It may take a *hair* of convincing, but it should *not* take a
hammer and block of wood!  If it does, you are the victim of poor quality
control on the new seal.  You need to talk to whoever sold the seal to
you.
