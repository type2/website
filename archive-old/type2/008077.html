&gt; A friend brought me his '71 bus to look at.  I'm more familiar with type 4
&gt; engines so I think I need some help.  
&gt; Upon acceleration, not consistently but about 50% of the time, there is
&gt; terrible hesitation to the point that the bus wants to die.  Stepping on the
&gt; clutch will bring it back to life.  It sputters through first gear and at
&gt; initial acceleration in second.  
&gt; Also, during deceleration, the engine has a tendency to stall.  
&gt; Rotor, points, condensor and dist. cap all are brand new.  Timing was just
&gt; adjusted this week.  Stock solex carb.
&gt; Can anyone help advise me where to begin?  Is the problem most likely in the
&gt; carburetor or is there a chance the fuel pump may be involved?  I'm new to
&gt; this type 1 engine.  


Sounds to me like one of a couple of easy things to check:

1) Check that the vacuum can on the distributor is OK and not leaking.
(What, no vacuum can?!? Get the original distributor on there!)
2) Check that the two vacuum lines are hooked to the right places.
The one on the dist. side of the can should be connected below the butterfly
and on the away side of the can should connect above the butterfly at the bast
of the carb.
3) Mabye it is too rich. Check that the main jet in the base of the fuel bowl
is still screwed in tight and that the idle volume and mixture screws (big and
small on left side of carb) are tuned according to spec.
4) Check advance timing with a timing light to make sure that it moves
about 30 degrees advanced, or notch about 2.5 inches to the left at 3000 RPM.
5) Check the timing on all four wires. 1 and 3 fire near notch, 2 and 4 fire
opposite.

Overall, it sounds like it is not happy with the advance curve. Like when I
had
the dreaded 009 in mine. Idled OK, but you had to 'pump' the accel to get it
to advance. Check the vacuum lines to the advance vacuum can and that the
weights inside are free to move. A timing light is the best way to check 
the advance.

Good luck!
