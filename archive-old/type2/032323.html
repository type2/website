For your motor it is showing that it's starting to get tired.  I have
always used the 100PSI mark as an indicator for rebuild time.  That and
also a PSI difference of 10 or more in any one cylinder.
Did you perform this test with the motor at temperature?  Also, did you do
the test in two parts?  The second test of course, being where a good
squirt of oil is shot into each cylinder thru the plug opening and then
tested again for PSI.  If so, what were your second readings?
On a similar note of interest...I have found that wrecking yard motors
give their PSI readings taken from cold motors that have been sitting.
I find that to be a relative reading and not too trustworthy.
