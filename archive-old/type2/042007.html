Subject: Re: Starting problems--temperature sensor #2?

I want to thank everyone (especially Sami and Bob) for
their help and advice concerning my cold starting
problem.  I'm awaiting delivery of a temp sensor #2 so
that I can figure out where it might fit, and
hopefully it will make a difference in the starting
and running of my 75 bus with a 79 engine.  Apparently
the #2 temp sensor is located in a different place on
later engines, which isn't mentioned in the Bentley or
Haynes manuals that I have.  Maybe in the Vanagon
manuals?

Once it starts, the bus runs well, but uses a little
oil--another project when I have time.  (Currently
doing brakes and rear seals in my 65 double cab, so no
room in the garage.)
