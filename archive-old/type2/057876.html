Subject: It (80 Westi) lives!

It's finally back on the road! A few months ago I bought an '80 Westi at
the end of its life from a fellow listmember (Jeff Carver) for a very good
price. Now, a few months, a few hundred dollars and a donor parts vehicle
later, the Westi finally runs!! But poorly....So, here's the situation.

After starting it, it runs very rich, blowing black smoke out of the
tailpipe. It's very weak and if you open the throttle, it powers up for a
moment, then slowly loses power, as if it is flooding.

It's an all california model, emission wise and everything seems to be in
decent working order. Is there something obvious I'm missing? I've played
around with it most of the evening, but haven't had any luck. Thanks!
