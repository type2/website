andy2 and anyone who cares.
I was on 135st and 95 at like 930 this morning and thought hell ill give a
call and see although I was to meet you there at noon (sorry)
So i went. I got a couple upright heads and a bent rear bumper from
Bunny(this guy is pretty bad off)
Ill prob go back when I have time to dig. 
Noteworthy:
I saw several Type 4 heads that looked new
Lots of type 4 motor parts
i might look harder at the westy interior 76 I think up on top of loft
ill prob try to dig for more SP heads and maybe see if I can find more
older motor parts they are scattered in 2 old bugs (1 turned into a pickup
and 1 with a truck camper attached to the back which has busted the rear
suspension and fallen in parts) and 2 trailers (bunny calls them his
buggies)
there seems to be most of a 76 or so westy in parts. front beam an
overhead
AC and god knows what else
Its all in pretty rough shape
also ther is a whole camper in the warehouse windows out i didnt look
inside I think a 76 as well

watch out for the bucket of dog doo
there is a jar in the beetle that he says has aborted dog babies in it so
watch out for that too
