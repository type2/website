&gt; Occasionally, I can turn my starter switch and the
&gt; starter doesn't hit a lick. Sometimes I can try
&gt; again and it will hit immediately on the second try.
&gt; Sometimes it takes 3 tries.&lt;&lt;

Do the dash lights dim a little bit when you turn the
key to &quot;start&quot; postion? If so, it is probably NOT the
ignition switch.  
Next time it happens, crawl under the bus and knock
the side of the starter and solenoid a couple of good
whacks with a wrench or small hammer. The try it
again, if it starts then, you got old dirty solenoid
or starter parts that get bound up inside the casing.
Just replace the suspect parts and off you go.
