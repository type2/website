Today found me taking a day off from
the BSODs and GPFs of working on my
research and finally popping the
heads off the 2L engine from my 80
Vanago &quot;project&quot;
 
Well, there was 1 cylinder that didn't have
obvious cracks from the seats.  The rest didn't
look too hot.
 
When I bought the van, non-running, the engine
was fairly oily.  From the looks of the heads,
its been driven pretty hard.  The flywheel is
pretty banged up, and one of the fuel injectors
was melted somehow.
 
 
I have an irrational desire to rebuild an engine
on my own, but I just don't see it making any kind
of economic sense at all given what I think would be
the condition of this unit.
 
My desire to have this thing out of the garage is growing.
It just doesn't seem worth the effort.
 
 
On the other hand, I'm dumping time into fixing major
rust in the wheelhouse area of my 77.  The engine, a GEX
unit with about 30k on it, runs like a top. I usually run
about 75-80 on the Interstate with it and it seems
to be happy.  I noticed that the little &quot;overheat&quot; circle
that was epoxied to the engine finally disappeared, but
I like to pretend that it just fell off after 5 years. 
 
I could take the engine out of the older Van and toss it into
the Vanagon with some work, but I like the breadloaf styling 
a lot more.
 
There are some structural issues that concern me with the older van,
and by all rights, I shouldn't do anything at all to it, but
driving it makes me feel good, so what the heck, eh? I don't
know under what circumstances I would ever get rid of it.
 
My apologies for the rambling; I'm at a bit of a crossroads
with this project, and in life in general.
 
Ideally, I'd find someone interested in fixing up the Vanagon. The body
is almost 100% rust free. It does need some very minor dents fixed, and
has
a primered nose section.  I was planning on painting it, putting in a
new headliner
and installing Camper bits (the stove/sink unit and bed) and turning it
into a sort of Weekender.
 
It would be a waste to part it out I think.  I will try to get some
photos for folks that may be interested......


have a good weekend all-
