Subject: Interior light door switch?


Might someone possess this knowledge?

The front ceiling interior light in my 1969 Transporter works if you reach up and switch it on, but
I'm wondering if there was ever a button or something on the door jamb so the light would go on when
you opened the door.  I see no evidence of anything on the door frame, but the light itself has two
male connectors, one of which has nothing connected.

I'm just starting to learn how the wiring in my bus works - I could be looking at the right wires,
connectors and almost not know it.  I'm loath to pull the headliner to see if there's a wire
floating around free up there...

Thanks!
