Subject: Re: peparts_dot_com and seat belts

I bought and installed the retractable seatbelt from gowesty_dot_com a few
months ago. I installed it on the passenger side of my '79 Westy and bolted
it into the original seat belt locations with no problem. Although the
instructions that came with it said to drill a separate hole in the wheel
when about 1 inch away from the stock hole. I am not sure why since it seems
to fit in the stock hole and appears to function OK, looks pretty vertical
etc.

On my drivers side I have a JC Whitney retractable belt that I installed 2
years ago. It was also a bolt on installation and was $99? on sale. The
gowesty belt is much nicer, heavier duty, smoother action and was $109 if my
memory is correct. 

Personally, I would get the gowesty_dot_com belt if I had to do it over again.

&gt;I found them in a print ad and they their website says they have a 3-point
&gt;retractable seat-belt for 68-79 busses. The print ad mentiones genuine Repa
&gt;parts so I'm interested in anyone has bought this and installed it.
