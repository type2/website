Not True! a catalytic converter is a chamber of catalyst ( as the name implies)
that catalyzes the combustion of unburned fuel and reduces nox and sox (somebody
correct me if im wrong on the nox and sox or have it backward with the unburned
fuel, i am not an engineer/chemist)  If you don't care about smog and air
pollution don't worry about it, but if you do the cat is integral to the
emissions system. (leaving my personal opinion out to avoid flames from a
certain subset of listees ... can't teach old dogs new tricks)
Also reduced back pressure can lean out the mixture so readjusting is a good
idea.  but i also wonder if it is a fitting for a cat or an egr? my impression
is that it is more likely an egr hookup, at least that make more intuitive sense
to me.   I imagine most listees can vouch that an egr is a good idea regardless
of your feelings of social responsibility, if only for keeping temps down.

&gt;  Catalytic converters simply force you to
&gt; keep your emissions in check or they will melt down, clog the exaust system,
&gt; and choke the engine until it dies.
