Subject: Timing Is Everything ;v)[free bus]

hey volks,
oh happy day!   how weird timing and karma etc. pan
out.   decided to take a half day at work so i left
and headed home.   on the way home i saw an old woman
stranded with a flat tire and slowed down to turn
around.   before i could get turned around, two other
cars pull over and get out to help, ill let them do
the good deed today.   proceed towards home again.   i
get into town and decide to stop by a nearby house
that has just moved an old westy onto the street.  i
pull up next to it and check it out, full of parts,
looks a little rough but pretty cool.   no one home so
i go to take off.   just them the owner pulls up so i
back up and ask him if its his bus.  he says yes and
says the junk man is a comin.   i say whats he giving
you for it, reply &quot;nothin&quot; to which i respond, well
ill take it!!  its yours then! awesome!   so if i had
not left work early, it would have been long gone, if
i had not stopped to see if the lady needed help i
would have missed the owner and not saved the bus
either.   funny how it all works out:)   anyways
enough friday dribble, the goods are as follows:
1968 westy, mid project so its a bit of a mess.   lots
of wiring needs finishing off and engine is out.  
heads bad, but lower end new, as in redone crank, new
pistons and sleeves, and a bus full of parts.   body
is in rough shape, but passable.   cant wait to dig
into it and see what ive got.   sorry for the
rambling, but im pretty stoked.
