Subject: Two Questions

With question 2 answered fairly well.( I haven't had a starter problem with a
twelve volt system...lucky me.)   .the answer to Question #1 is...: If the
ignition fires when the mark is to the left of the crack, then the ignition is
advanced.  If the ignition fires when the mark is to the right of the mark, then
the ignition is retarded.  The Rotation of the pulley is clockwise when the
engine is running, so mark to the left means before tdc and mark to the right
means after tdc.    John Jensen in Annapolis
