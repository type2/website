&gt;Wow! This was great. Thanks. Now I have another question. What is the major
&gt;difference between motor-oils, and what does everyone recommend?

There are no MAJOR differences between oils meeting current SF specs.

Everyone recommends all different kinds of things, for reasons of every 
variety, and in some cases with no reason at all in play. I recommend 
looking at the oil charts for your engine and using any brand name motor 
oil in the appropriate weight rating for the ambient temps the charts show. 
More important than anything else, keep it clean by inspection, not milage 
or time.
