Subject: RE: [T2] Synthetic oil

&gt; I also went with Mobile1 15W50 after the break in.  Before and after the
&gt; rebuild, if I was running at 65 on a 85+ degree day and let the engine
&gt; idle while coasting down a hill or just pulling over for that
&gt; matter....my oil light would flicker to the beat of the engine.  Before
&gt; the rebuild I ran SAE 40 and afterwards used 20W50.  Since I have
&gt; changed to the full synthetic 15W50, my temps stay much cooler (220_at_65 /
&gt; 230_at_75) and the oil light does not come on anymore.  Now, I do not have
&gt; an oil pressure gauge so I am not certain.  My question is... Was my oil
&gt; pressure dropping do to the higher temps of the oil?  Sometimes this

dino oil gets thinner as it gets hotter, synthetic doesn't anywhere near
as much if at all.

&gt; would occur even if the oil temps were not all that high. Say, around
&gt; 230 or so.  This was with the petroleum based oil.  I have had my oil
&gt; temps go up to 250 since I changed to the synthetic but the oil light

wheeh I won't let mine get that hot, at 230 I slow down, at 240 I drive at
55 at 250 I pull over under a tree and open the engine comp door and run
at a fast idle in neutral or park

&gt; has never flickered.  What am I missing here?  It has been my
&gt; understanding that as oil temps rose, oil pressure dropped.  Do I have
&gt; this wrong? 

not wrong for Dino oil, synthetic operates under different rules....the
heat resistance of synthetic is one of it's greatest advantages

&gt; But, if the oil temps were 230, why would the light still
&gt; flicker. Or, does this have nothing to do with the oil pressure and I

shouldn't flicker with synthetic...

&gt; just need to go to bed because its too late for me to think right?

nite nite!
