If you know the builder is GEX, or you know not the builder, the only way 
to spec the motor is teardown, then skilled use of precision instruments 
certifiable to a standard, then proven procedures to prove tolerances 
within acceptable limits.

Save the most possible money and get a long block from the rebuilder with 
the best rep for best results with VW motors. They will put mostly new 
parts in it with properly machined used rods and cranks and cases, or you 
can specify all new parts. Try NWConRod if you're in the NW US. All they 
charge is in the motor you buy, with but a weekend 2 line ad in the local 
classifieds for an ad budget. Word of mouth keeps them hopping doing all 
the machining and assembly verified spec or better. If you maintain it as 
well as they built it, you will get the life of a new original factory 
motor easy.

I've never had a back charge for an unacceptable core yet, and some were 
burned up by garden hose full flow oil cooler add on junk. I can't imagine 
what parts in them could be reworked or used. But a skilled machinist can 
determine any part that will be reusable.

The problem with GEX is, the highest salaries are paid to the advertising 
and graphics supervisors, not to the assembly room manager.
