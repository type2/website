Subject: Re: [T2] '79 bus engine tin needed - hot running

I looked in the Bentley, but no help there. If you go here and look at K:
http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/exhaustcomp1979-cal.html
Look at the right end where the muffler would attach. See that 2&quot; round pipe
sticking up? [not the best drawing....] That is where the heater fan tube
attaches. Not thru the upper cylinder tin like 72 to 78 and 79 Fed engines. On
those other engines, the heater box is sitting where the cat is on a 79 Cal
engine.
Go to this page and scroll down to Engine Tin 72 through 83:
http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/aircoolsystem.html
G is 79 Cal only. Part number 039-119-527
Sorry, no pic.  But if you are looking at the engine and the corner tin, it
will be in the shape of a large L. Where the part of the L is _, it meets the
center piece. The 2&quot; hole is in the _ section where it curves down to meet the
center piece.

&gt; &gt; Just a little FYI:
&gt; &gt; The left rear corner on a 79 Cal version engine is one-year-only. It has a
&gt; &gt; large round hole in it that no other one has....
&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, I don't have one.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; ?????  mine had a round hole further forward where the pieces of tin
&gt; joined, you don't mean that do you.... I flattened a 100ft roll of film
&gt; can painted it black and bolted it to one side over the hole...found to
&gt; seal it completely I had to bolt both sides
