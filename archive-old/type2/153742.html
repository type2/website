I think with MB there is also a certain amount of &quot;image keeping&quot; in the
US market.  We don't seem to get the more &quot;pedestrian&quot; models that are
sold elsewhere.  MB seems to want to stay upscale in the US.

(my opinion, of course.  Karl, correct me if I am wrong.)

The same seems to apply to other makers.  Small station wagons from Japan?
Forget it, all the US gets is mini-SUVs  that sell for 50% more.

Correct, MB is now talking about bringing in the Smart 2 door car, which is already in Canada. But it will NOT
be sold or serviced by Mercedes dealers in the US. It will be franchised thru Penske's United Auto Group.
