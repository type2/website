Subject: 12 point star tool for CVs

        Rodney wonders:

BTW, will a Torx bit fit those 12-point bolt heads?

NO! TORX is not the same as 12 point. Try your local
Mac or Snap-On professional tool service. To make sure
you get the right size, ideally bring a bolt with you.
The hex-head version uses a 6mm hex driver, so odds are
you want a 6mm 12 point star driver.
