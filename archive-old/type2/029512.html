Volks,

I got my horn working yesterday.  To do it I had to tear the whole bloody
steering column apart.  I took a bunch of pictures as I put it back
together, to try to explain what is going on in there...  One major
problem, tho is that even after having done it, I still don't understand
it.

As with so many VW circuits, the switch for the horn is in the ground
wire.  The theory is that power comes to the horn from the fuse box, then
the ground wire emerges from the horn, heads over to the steering column
and is connected to the base of the shell around the steering shaft.  This
shell goes up to the steering wheel, and connects to one side of the horn
button.  the other side of the horn button connects to the steering shaft
and then to the steering box.  When you press the button, it closes the
switch and connects the steering column shell (and thus the horn) to
ground.  The horn blows.  

The problem is that if the steering column shell connects to ground (the
body of the bus) anywhere except the horn button, the horn blows full
time!  It is isolated by a plastic bushing at the base and a rubber donut
at the top.  If either of these are out of place, you will probably not
have a working horn.

Anyway, the pictures I took are at:

I hope they help anyone who is trying to get their horn working on an
early bay.  The theory will be the same on the later steering column, but
the layout at the top will be very different.  I don't have a late bay
(yet :-) so I am only advertising these for the early bay.

In addition, the last picture in the series shows how the turn signal
switch is *supposed* to engage the column so that it does not twist on the
column... another constant problem.
