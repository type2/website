Subject: [T2] Exhaust fumes in cab

Hey all!
When I bought my '75 camper, all the heat channels, heat control boxes, etc. were gone.  Yes completely gone.  The heat exchangers were both there and appeared to be OK.  Being the financially strapped master of &quot;rig&quot; that I am, I &quot;creatively engineered&quot; a new main channel out of PVC pipes and connected the heat exchangers to this pipe via flexible aluminum vent pipes.  Amazingly enough, this rig seemed to work in getting some heat into my bus!  That's the good news...the bad news is that I started smelling fumes, and my eyes got a little watery and burning (not a good sign, right?).  My question is this:  Is fumes in the cab a sign of a bad heat exchanger or is it probably just a &quot;design flaw&quot; in my engineering marvel (possibly not a perfect seal where the alumnium pipes connect with the heat exchanger??)  Any advice would be appreciated..
