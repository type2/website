These are pretty thick and rarely go.  If compromised they will let air
into the intake and run you lean.  Before removing, I'd seal them up
over the outside with E6000 sealer (urethane), check boat or plastics
supply places- this stuff is great on canvas, hoses, etc, flexible,
strong, and sticks far better than silicone.

&gt; The 4 flexible hoses that come off of the intake air distributor on my
&gt; '77 appear to be old and crumbly and I'm wondering if it is worth while
&gt; to replace them.  I mean, can I just cut them off and slip new ones on
&gt; or is this another big project?  Also, If they are leaking what are the
&gt; consequences?  I'm sure that this has been asked before but I couldn't
&gt; find the information in the archive.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Ben
