--part1_6.1d739ed1.28f7eaba_boundary

All this talk about insulation!!  I've been thinking of doing the same for my 
76.  Anyone know of a good supplier (cheapest) for the foil backed dynamat?  
And what about the 3M spray?  Should any paint shop have the stuff or do I 
have to look around?

Many thanks in advance.
