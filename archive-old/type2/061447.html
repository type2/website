Subject: Let's talk fuel lines

With the recent talk of fire, and since I am in the middle of replacing my
fuel lines on my 1970 Westy, I thought it might be a good time to bring
this up.  Especially since I have a few questions. :-)

- The filler hose.  Has anyone made the hose from NAPA work?  When I
removed my filler neck, my original braided filler looked straight.  I did
not realize it was bent until I searched the archives.  Someone mentioned
using a 45 degree copper elbow.  Is it a big enough bend that it will not
work with straight hose?

- My Westy had the original fuel hose with the metal line running straight
to the fuel pump.  I obviously need to keep a piece where it goes through
the firewall (yes I have a new grommet), but how much metal line should I
run before I go back to the braided cloth?  Just enough to run through the
firewall (6&quot; or so) or should I keep the original metal piece with the bend
in it going until about 3&quot; from the fuel pump?  Any advantage to either?

- Finally, what is this bulkhead fitting that The Honorable Mr. Hoover
talks about?  I have not bought a CD yet, and the sermons are well...you
know.  I saw talk of it in the archives.

Yes I put new clamps on everything.

Thanks for your $.02
