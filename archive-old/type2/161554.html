Subject: RE: [T2] YES!!! JUST DROVE MY BUS!!!!

&gt;What can I do about that lifter?

Aye, there's the rub.... I have a muy flat cam lobe from one of those rat 
bas*ards. Engine's in boxes, bags and cans right now awaiting the new 
cam.......hopefully this week.

Did you install new push rods when you rebuilt? New lifters?
