Subject: DP in a late bay

OK I know it can be done, I am putting a 1776 upright into a 73 bus , Other
that the missing tin, what do I need to know? A friend said that I need
longer bottom studs, does that sound correct , as for the fly wheel will it
fit? Any input would be great.

Ian in va( can't wait for EB!!!!!!)
