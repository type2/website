Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel warning

There are additives that stations add to their fuel tanks to cut down 
on corrosion  and other stuff like condensation. I have heard of this 
stuff getting overused.  It sounds like maybe somebody got carried away 
and a station may need to clean its tanks.  not much chance of that 
though.  the normal station manager is going to let the customers take 
care of that.   a lot cheaper.  no everclear in CA anymore??  
darn..years  ago  when i was in CA,  Chico and other locations lived on 
it and  Mad Dog.
