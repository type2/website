http://www.gacker_dot_com/odd_latch.jpg

this pic is of under the rear seat on the passenger (right) side of the 
bus. what the heck is that lever/latch that i'm holding used for? It 
clanks around when i take turns or hit bumps. you can see where its worn

the paint. And... what is that little white knob there for?

this is a '74 westfaila with the stove, sink and refrigerator.
