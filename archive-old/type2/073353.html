for those interested, i've been doing some research on plywood for my 71
westy. i plan to replace the wall panels in the back, as well as the panels
on the front doors and under the dash and i'd like to re-do the veneer on
the cabinets as well. now that i've gone to the trouble of recarpeting it,
i want to replace the rotted out birch plywood with something nicer. so...

i found a place here in boston [somerville, actually] that specializes in
marine plywoods. Boulter Plywood. http://www.boulterplywood_dot_com/ - a boat
builder friend recommended them. I called to get a price on 3mm mahogany
plywood and found out that it's actually pretty cheap. at least, it's a lot
less than i had expected. they have african mahogany plywood, 3 ply, 3mm x
4' x 8' sheets, for $39 or so. they also have a better grade of the stuff
for about $69 a sheet. I also asked about veneers, since the veneer on my
cabinet is starting to peel off. mahogany veneer, 10mil [says it's like
heavy walpaper] is about $60 per 4x8 sheet.

i'm going to swing by there on saturday morning to take a look at the
selection. if there's anything interesting, i'll let you all know.
