Subject: oil pressure readings
Message-ID: &lt;37582E68.7F24921E_at_aztek-eng_dot_com&gt;

I apologize for the vague question.  How low can my oil pressure go
before I need to start worrying?  Obviously I'm curious about idle and
highway speeds?  I can't remember what the Bentley says...   BTW, I've
got a FI type IV engine with a VDO oil pressure sender/guage and stock
idiot light.  I live about 6000 feet above sea level and plan on making
some passes at 12,000 feet.  TIA

Pete
