Subject: engine swap/assesment 2nd post

Greetings,

I am getting ready to pull the engine out of my rusty, canabolized '79 westy 
and intend to put it into my '78 restoration project. The engine, FI 2.0 
Liter Hyd. Lifters, has about 60k on it since the last rebuild which 
included everything including a total balancing job (AMC heads). I had the 
engine rebuilt shortly after I bought the bus ~6 years ago, all the 
maintenance has been under my control. It runs well. I am wondering what I 
should check before i pull the engine and what to check while it is out. The 
engine has not had a thermastat or the flaps as long as I have owned it but 
I have a set of flaps now. All fuel lines and vacuum lines will be replaced 
and the gas tank cleaned and coated. I have pulled several engines in the 
past so I am really only looking for advice about what to check that will 
save me headache in the future.

Here is what I have so far but I know there are more things I should check.

Before pull:

Compression test - Done. all 4 are 110 to 120


While out:

cluch inspect
install thermastat and control flaps
Clean and paint tin
Replace rear main seal? (I think this is what is leaking, up by the 
flywheel/bell housing) This is the worst.
replace pushrod tube seals (at least one is leaking)
New injector seals?
Check end play.
look for other oil leaks.
replace pilot bushing? in bell housing for starter.
check the rubber engine mounts


I've thought about checking the heads but I'd rather not take them off? Any 
comments?
I've checked the archives (most stuff I search under is about removal) I 
remember this was on the list just a few weeks ago but they're not in the 
archives yet, should have saved those.

Many thanks,
Brandt

little
