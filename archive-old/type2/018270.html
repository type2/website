Subject: Re: recommended MAX spark adv.

Ok, I'm learning.  As a point of curiosity, would somebody explain to me
why the type IV engine is supposed to have a higher total advance?  My
understanding of advance is based on Muir's explanation, which makes it
sound like the point of advance is to get the spark there a little
earlier at higher rpms, such that the propper amount of advance is
solely dependent on rpms; in which case, it would appear that 3500 rpms
on a type IV engine would require the same advance as 3500 rpms on a
type I engine.  What am I missing here?

BTW, I'm sorry if this has been answered already.  I know I asked it
once before, but I've been losing mail due to a &quot;migration&quot; recently
underway here at 'jhu_dot_edu' -- I know I didn't see my own question in any
of the digests I've gotten.  Oh, and then there's the fact that I'm
apparently not quite up to speed in understanding carburation &amp;etc.

Thanks.
