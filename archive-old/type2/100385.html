Subject: Seat Rebuilding

Has anyone ever attempted to rebuild the seats in their bus?  I don't mean
simply new padding and covers, but actually replacing broken springs, etc. to
bring the seats back to their original level of firmness.  I put new cushions
on my old, tired out seats, and it made a big improvement, but I noticed that
a few of the springs on the seat bottom along the front edge and outer side
were broken, causing the seats to sag and not provide adequate support.  I
tried to patch the broken springs (these are the springs that look like &quot;s&quot;
stacked on top of each other) with some steel tube and light brazing, but it
didn't hold up for long.  The other day while at the fabric store I noticed
some spring material that looked almost the same, and probably would work just
fine.  I also just thought about replacing all the spring material in the seat
bottom with a big foam cushion.  Anyone have experience in this area?
