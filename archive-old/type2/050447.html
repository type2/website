Subject: [T2] seat springs

I stripped my seat down to the springs yesterday to get it ready for my new 
seat covers and pads. Of course all of the springs
are rusted and the frame is too. I am going to paint the frame and was 
wondering if the springs should be painted also? Is this a
good idea or just a major pain that wouldn't do any good? When the seats 
were brand new were the springs painted or bare
metal? If anyone has tried this before, please let me know.

Thanks in advance,
Nathan  74 Bus
