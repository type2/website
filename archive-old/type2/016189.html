&gt;I did it! I took the plunge and am now the owner of a 77 Westfalia
&gt;Campmobile. I have started the renovation first by simply cleaning her up.
&gt;I am in need of some parts but primarily I am interested in a good service
&gt;manual. Does anyone have a lead? 

Get both a Bentley and a Haynes.  Bentley is best, but the Haynes has good
info also.  I've seen both at parts stores, book stores, and various book or
bus websites.  

&gt;Also, my next step is to change the oil
&gt;and filters etc... Is there an oil treatemnet or addative that is
&gt;recomended for air cooled engines? 

I havn't used any oil additives in my bus, but I have used Duralube in my 89
Jeep with 260,000 miles and it doesn't use a drop of oil.  I added a new
additive called Energy Release to the power steering pump and it actually
fixed it.  Before I added the ER, I could barely budge the steering wheel if
the outside temp was below 30 degrees.  Since I assumed I need to replace
the steering box I assumed I had nothing to lose.  I added about 4-6 ounces
of Energy Release and now it works like nothing was ever wrong.  I'm
actually amazed because I have never noticed any difference (good or bad)
with other additives in the oil, transmissions, differentials, power
steering pumps, etc.  As far as fuel additives I use STP fuel injector
cleaner about every 5,000.  It works well and makes a noticable difference
at idle and starting.  Others use Techron and I tried it, but it seemed to
work about the same as the STP.

&gt;I want to start with the simple things.
&gt;It seems like there are alot of disconnected wires hanging around. This
&gt;model camper has the stove, sink (with external pump), refridgerator (does
&gt;anyone know if this refridge is propane fueled -  how I may find out?)

The fridge is NOT propane.  Your lucky if it works at all.  If it does work,
it runs off AC via the plug in the side of your bus or off DC via the
auxillary battery.  Good luck.

&gt;I suppose these wires at one time were ment to opperate these features but
&gt;now hang uselessly waiting for someone to really love this poor neglected
&gt;van. I need some handles for the cabinet doors - the ones thaat have the
&gt;little button that you push to open...

Somewhere on the net (I think it's on the TYPE II website) is a wiring
diagram for a Westy.  Most wiring for the camper is pretty straight forward.
The Bentley or Haynes manual will have wiring diagrams for the bus itself,
but not for the camper options.  I buy most of my parts locally at a import
parts store, but Busdepot_dot_com also has excellent prices and products.  It is
one of the best sites for camper items such as handles, pumps, window knobs,
etc.  
  
&gt;Your help is super appreciated,
&gt;David Day

Good luck and congratulations on your new purchase.
