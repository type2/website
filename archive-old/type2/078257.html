&gt; &gt;  Just thinking about running synthetic in my new motor. Is it worth it?
&gt;  &gt;What brand and weight should I choose? I have heard Mobil 1 is the best.
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  I use Mobil One 15w50 year round in Minnesota with good results.  No
&gt;  jump-starting, even in our winters.

I used to use Castrol 20w-50 in the summer and 10w-30 in the winter, also 
Minnesota, but tried Castrol Synthetic 5W-50 this winter.  So far it's done 
pretty well.
