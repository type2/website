Yo List

So this guy wrote:

&gt;      Well,gang I had some nice words and not so nice words dealing with my
&gt; art. file format.  I won't be selling the bus to the people with the not
so
&gt; nice words (you know who you are).

What is with people - there must be some real d*ck h*ads on these lists. So
the guy didn't realize what kinda files he was loading - big deal.    I
recall that not that long ago Clara was resigning from the list, if I recall
correctly, because of some insults by a couple of AH's.  I recall a similar
situation with NQ.  I loved NQ's posts and I appreciate Clara's as well.  If
people are going to be so obnoxious as to make people quit the list or not
post - maybe those obnoxious people should be shown the door.  As has been
said in the past - the list is not a democracy.  There is no right to free
speech on the list.

To parapharse Confusious:

&quot;The problem with being rude to people is that you are a reflection of your
parents and how your parents brought you up.  Being rude shows that you had
really bad parents.&quot;
