Don't forget to check the CV joints.  They can make a lot of racket.
I assume that you have checked the exhaust joints for leaks.  
After the non-CA to CA conversion on my '80, it was a LOT quieter.  
The primary culprit was the donut sealed joint immediately before the 
muffler.

&gt; The '82 GL I recently bought is a lot noisier than my '84 (grit your teeth) 
&gt; waterboxer which is an automatic. The engine which has an aftermarket 
&gt; &quot;bugpack&quot; exhaust connected to the heat exchangers. I think it's mainly the 
&gt; exhaust makes this engine a lot noisier than mye '84's. The manual transmission 
&gt; is also a lot noisier. Could the '84 have a lot more undercoating and 
&gt; soundproofing as compared to the '82. Aside from the differences in the 
&gt; powertrains are the older vans inherently noisier? I suspect this is the case.  
&gt; Don't get me wrong, I like the '82 it's a lot more fun to drive and a lot peppier 
&gt; than the '84. The noises that bothers me most in the '82 though come from the 
&gt; loose suspension things that rattle and go klunk when I drive over rough roads 
&gt; and (slowly) over speed bumps. My '84s suspension is quite tight and I'd like to 
&gt; make the '82 the same!
