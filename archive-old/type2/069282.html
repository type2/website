Subject: Help with Sunroof on 65 Deluxe

I'm finally finishing up the quick 6 year restoration on my 1965 
deluxe microbus and I have just a few left over parts and a couple 
of questions on the sunroof assembly.  If anyone has done one of 
these sunroofs, any help would be really appreciated!

I am replacing the sunroof lining and outer cover and in the 
Bentley book under the section on Removal of the Top Cover 
Lining, it says remove 4 screws securing lining to guide bow.  
What 4 screws??  Where do they go and what do they look like?  
As far as I can tell, cause I just don't remember after 6 years, there 
should be 2 screws, one on each side at the forward most section 
of the guide bow.  These screws would fasten the leading edge of 
the liner material to the bow and would be partially hidden in the 
track when it is all put back together.  I don't have any screws left 
over that will work.  Do these screws have finishing washers like 
the other screws that hold the liner to the other bows?  
Unfortunately, none of my pictures and notes makes this clear.

The other problem is a couple of extra parts that I don't 
remember where they go.  There are 2 rectangular chrome pieces, 
each approx. 3/4&quot; wide by 1 1/2&quot; long.  Each one has a slight bend 
to it that is similar to the bend at the tips of the tensioning  bows.  
Each one also has a small hole in it.  Where do these guys go??

After working on this baby for 6 years, I can hardly wait to finish 
it, and the sunroof is just about the last thing to go.  Soon we'll be 
on the road again!
