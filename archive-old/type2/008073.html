Subject: orange plaid
Date: Tue, 15 Dec 1998 15:31:03 -0500

Does anyone out there have any of the orange plaid upholstery that came
with the 74 and later Westfalias that they would be willing to part with? 
I am only looking for a small amount in order to recover the jump seat.

Thanks
Ed Woenker
74 Westy
