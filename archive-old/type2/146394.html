Subject: Question about new pistons &amp; cylinders

I am in the final throws of making a purchase for some new pistons &amp;
cylinders for my 1700 '72 transporter. I believe I have found what I
need; they will replace what I have and within a reasonable price range.
I do however have one thing holding me back. Every once in awhile I will
run across a posting talking about how much better quality German
manufactured parts are than Brazilian. How much of this is true? In this
particular purchase, should I even be concerned?



Thanks,



Chris
