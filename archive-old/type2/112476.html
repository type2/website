Subject: Fluke 77 continuity?

I have this Fluke that I borrowed and was wondering what kind of readings I 
should be getting for continuity. 

I'm still &quot;plugging&quot; away at this wiring problem in my 69 and am new to the 
multimeter thing and was only reading 3V at certain terminals that should be 
12V. Jiggled the wires and suddenly got 12V. All of my connections do not seem 
to be corroded to the point where it would cause interference. So I thought I 
should check continuity in the main wires coming from the starter.
