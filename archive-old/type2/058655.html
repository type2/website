Subject: Missing Exhaust studs
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

I apologize to the list for my earlier bone-head post about thread repair on
exhaust manifold studs. With some additional effort and time, I finally
figured how to search the archives but subject matter instead of just title.
There was quite a bit of stuff on the subject so it must be a common problem.

I'm now a little concerned about helicoil repair of stripped threads. Sounds
like spark plug holes don't do well with helicoil repair long term. Looks like
the heat and weight of the exhaust system would weigh heavily on those eight
studs. Does the helicoil hold up well longterm?

Nobody in town seems to have timesert repair in 9 mm and the only hope of
helicoil in that size is Pep Boys which I will check tonight. 

Thanks for not sending the deserved &quot;look it up in the archive, Stupid!&quot;
