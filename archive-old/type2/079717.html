Subject: Re: [T2] More FI questions/woes


&gt; &gt; Not only does it help reduce emissions but it
&gt; &gt; keeps the heads cooler.
&gt; &gt; Sounds win-win to me.  The goal is not to cool
&gt; &gt; the exhaust gases down as
&gt; &gt; that wouldn't really help anything that I know
&gt; &gt; of, but to use the exhaust
&gt; &gt; gases to keep the combustion chamber temps
&gt; &gt; down.
&gt; 
&gt; If this is the concensus by the learned guru's,
&gt; and so far no one has commented to the contrary,
&gt; then I'd better go check to ensure my EGR is
&gt; working.  :)  

When I reinstalled the EGR system on my '77 2.0L with stock everything I
noticed a 5 degree drop in head temps and 7-10 degrees cooler on the oil
for roughly equivalent conditions and driving style. I am sold on the EGR
system being a good thing, and will keep it installed until I can't fix or
find the parts anymore. Hopefully for a long time to come.
