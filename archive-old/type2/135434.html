Subject: Shopping list for head replacement

Back for more advice after great response last time :)

I've decided to go ahead and replace the head on my '83 aircooled.
While the Bentley wings its way towards me, and I pore through Muir
and Haynes each chance I get, I'm trying to put together a shopping
list for this project.

Would anyone mind helping me with a list of required parts? What sorts
of gaskets will I need, do I need to replace the cylinder head nuts,
valve cover, etc? I'm assuming that the busdepot_dot_com head will arrive
with the valves and springs already in place? Are there nuts or bolts
or electrical connectors that are commonly rusted that I'll be
removing with the engine, and that should be replaced?

And what is this &quot;8mm triple-square&quot; that I hear talk about? Is it
simply a 12-point wrench?

Thanks a lot for your help!

Regards,
Mike J.
