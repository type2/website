Subject: octane and compression ratio

An interesting statement on p 66 of the October issue of VW Trends. 
Paraphrasing:  a fuel with an octane rating of 87 spontaneously 
ignites at a certain value of compression ratio. The implication is 
that 87 should not be used at ratios higher than whatever value is 
associated with it.

Has anyone seed a table or graph of maximum compression ratio versus 
octane rating? If, indeed,these exist, then they could serve as a 
good guide when one is choosing the compression ratio during a 
rebuild. For example, if one were to choose 7.3:1, then he would know 
that this will mean he will have to fill up with the corresponding 
octane forever more.
