Subject: Jerome Bus Raffle

The 1st ticket on the Jerome raffle bus was 900325, the lone person standing
by the bus had 900324---So she missed winning a 1966 Original E-Z Camper by
ONE number--So I reached into the bin of over 15,000 tickets, and pulled
900951 !!! just a difference of 26 numbers  This time she WON!! Incredible--
But the story does NOT end there  The holder of the 1st number 900325 was
ASLEEP and he missed winning the bus !! I guess she was destined to win the
bus--
PS: The holder of 90025 NEEDED a bus as his was broke !!


If anyone has pictures of Jerome,  and it was one of the best eve,r  Please
forward them to--
Arozona Bus Club Newsletter or Kyle Tillman. Please !!
