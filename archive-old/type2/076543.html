Subject: Fires don't always start with fuel lines

Personal note.
    I had a good friend discover his bus was on fire while he was =
stopped at
a light.  Turns out the auxillary blower shorted and started to melt =
wires,
which then ignited spilled oil around the filler tube.  No major damage =
or
explosions, but his AFM and most of his engine wiring harness were
destroyed....  I can only image what would happen if the fire had burned =
for
much longer.  Which is why everyone should carry a fire extinguisher in
their bus.  I keep mine in the slot under the drivers seat(always close =
at
hand and usually&quot;hopefully&quot; far from the fire.  Another point to make =
about
fire safety is to keep your fuel ring up off the tin surface.  Of course
this relates to my 78 transporter and YMMV.  Maybe there is a flame
retardant coating that could be applied to high pressure fuel lines that
could delay tragedy.  Any thoughts??

&gt;
&gt; &lt;&lt; And another note, aren't most of the first in VW busses caused by =
old,
&gt; cracked
&gt; fuel lines?  If you change your lines, what else would cause a fire?  =
just
&gt; curious?
&gt;
&gt; Mike &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Any number of electrical sources for fires back there. Loose wires
shorting...
&gt; battery not bolted down, etc. Add some old spilled oil and you could =
have
&gt; enough
&gt; of a start to cook a fuel line and really BBQ your VW...
