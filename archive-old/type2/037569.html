Subject: Camshaft Gear Rivet Failures

Hey All:

I've got a rebuilt '79 type IV engine (18 months ago) with about 6500 miles
on it.  It runs well, has power etc.  I've got a ticking noise, similar to
a collapsed lifter, except a little quieter (but getting louder) and at a
higher frequency... like each time the engine fires.  Investigation with a
stethescope points directly to the oil pump area.  A few months back I read
about camshaft gear rivet failures so I checked the archives.  Sure enough,
seems to be all too common.

My question is this:  Where can I get a quality camshaft?  I don't need to
be tearing the engine down every few thousand miles.  Can these things be
welded?

I would like to hear from some of the folks that have experienced this
problem.  Chris Slaymaker, Bob Perring, Joe Fornier, Blake Sartin  etc.  Is
there any way to test for this without ripping the whole damn thing apart?
Can this be checked by pulling the oil pump?
