Subject: Re: [T2] if it ain't one thing...

silly, i know there is a difference between 6 and 12... i was wondering
if the alt was compatible with both. sorry, misworded it. didn mean &quot;does
it matter&quot;, i meant... uh... whatever i already said. oh well, that is
why i am an artist, not a poet.

ok, so my bus is a 70... that is 12v, right?

;^) thanks for humoring me,
chris

....QUESTION: is the alt generally a 12v or 6v or does it matter?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes 12 volts is different from 6 volts and I don't think there was 
&gt; ever a 6 volt alternator.
