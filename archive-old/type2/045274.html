Subject: [T2] Catch of the Day

Went back to the junkyard today and mostly found Vanagon parts. Two sets of
rear lenses with bulbholders (have you seen what those go for new?!), and
two sets of red side markers (them, too!).

I've been going through my stash, too, and I've got more Vanagon rear
lenses, plus some front turn signal lenses, and a spare rear bumper rubber
strip for the square bumper (73-79), if anyone's looking for one of those.

More news as I delve.
