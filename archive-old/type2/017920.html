snip..
&gt; p.s.)  Of all the cubbyholes in the westy, a well trained dog or persistent cop is going to find your stash. Nothing beats the security of keeping ones stash tucked securely in ones undies snip....

Years ago when I use to follow the Grateful Dead tour we used to stash
our &quot;stash&quot; inside the drain pipe for the sink.  There is that great
little screw on cap, a little duct tape and up the tube it went.  We
were pulled over perhaps a dozen times in such delightful, open minded
places as South Carolina, New Jersey, Illinois, Indiana etc., and never
once was it discovered.  Also I was aware back then of a court decision
that had thrown out charges against someone who had been charged with
possession of pot.  The reason the charge was thrown out was that the
pot was found outside the vehicle, it was in a hub cap, and the
defendant had successfully argued that they had been traveling and that
it was not there's. Since the possibility of it being placed in the hub
cap by someone other than the defendant could not be ruled out, the case
was dismissed.  That was a different time back in the mid '80's, so this
case may be moot now.
