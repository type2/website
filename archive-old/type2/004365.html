Subject: Heeeellllppp!!! (trans/final drive)
Message-ID: &lt;0058022ea47f$06e32f60$8858fed0_at_default&gt;

Ok I was drving along today in my 80 westy automatic when I start hearing
this clunking sound that is dependant of speed... about 2 miles later there
is a huge bad sound and I am forced to coast into a parking lot.  I got
under the van and the left drive shaft is very misaligned and now moves left
to right. When I start the motor and put it in gear i get a loud
crashing/clanging/banging/expensive sound. I'm going to pull the pan off the
bottom of the final drive tomorrow to see what I can see but I don't really
know what I'm doing or what it could be. Im hoping its just the CV joint or
something else easy and cheap.  It just seems odd that i get clanging when
the van is in gear but I'm not moving.  There souldn't be anyting turning in
the final drive when I'm not moving should there?  I've never had to work on
anything in the drive train before.... any ideas/suggestions?  I know I'm
new to the list and asking a lot of questions but how else do you learn ya
know :) I am deeply appreciative of any help.

thanks
