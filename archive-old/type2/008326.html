Hey All,


I've got a new one for you all, when was the last time you checked
your accel-cable travel vs. your carbs linkage-travel?


Seriously. 

Get someone to sit in the drivers seat of the bus and &quot;floor&quot; the
gas-pedal while you sit and look at the carb. While they have it
floored, check the play in the carb's linkage. Is there excessive
play? If so, it ain't right. I've been told that 1-1.5 mm is normal
travel without engaging the carb. True?

 I found that while the pedal was floored, there was still about 3&quot; of
travel left in my carbs linkage. 

That means lost power.

I will find the answer and post it. 


Anyone giving advice/taking odds?



Jaime
