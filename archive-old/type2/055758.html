Subject: re: Haynes vs Bentley

I have the Bentley manual you seek at

http://www.peak_dot_org/~maynardj/books.html

as well as many other manuals and VW books.

And all profits from this webpage go to NEATO and LiMBO Chapter
Volkswagens of Western Oregon to put on the Jurassic Bug In, July 25 in
Corvallis, OR.

Hows that for a bunch of plugs? :)
