Subject: Gas heater question
Date: Thu, 30 Nov 2000 16:01:38 -0500

Volks: My 76 bus has the standard gas heater under the middle of the bus.
It works fine, but about every half hour or so it trips out, an I need to 
reach up under the dash to the left of the steering column, and click the
little red 
lever sticking out of the bottom of a little 2&quot;x2&quot;x2.5&quot; black box. It will
then run for about an other 1/2 hour
and trip out again, and so on. Any ideas what is wrong.

Note that the heater exhaust pipe has been rusting away, and now has some
holes near the 
heater end if this makes any difference.

Other than that it works fine, although if you turn it up to max temp, it
will cook you out of the bus 
pretty quick. The thing seems like way overkill for temperatures down to
about -25F. Maybe its 
sized for the North?
