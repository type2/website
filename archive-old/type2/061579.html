Subject: Phil Lesh

Sorry for getting everyone's panties in a bundle, I did not mean to
indicate that Phil could not afford nor was bumping anyone out of line
for a liver.  I figured I would inform the VW Bus community that he
had finally gone into the hospital, I believe to get the needed liver,
after months of waiting.  I figured not alot of people would know, but
a nice thought or prayer was all I indicated which I believe can help
others.  I think you are all justified to say if he got preferential
treatment it is warranted to say that it is Bull Sh*t!. We will have
to wait and see. I would prefer if you have any comments please flame
me not to the list, I meant to inform and maybe didn't have 100% of my
facts straight but thought a decent amount of people in this
commuunity would want to hear about it.  Once again any Phoenix area
listees who want to have a beer and show off their busses between the
26-2 let me know, I will buy!!!  I will periodically be checking my
email.

Happy holidays and lets be careful out there!

Flynn
