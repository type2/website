&gt; 'On/off valve seat events' is called ramp speed.
&gt; Lift and duration has nothing to do with ramp speed.

I disagree. Though there is no DIRECT correlation of these to one another, a
mild cam (low duration) is very unlikely to have a fast ramp, and a long
duration cam is unlikely to have a slow ramp. The reason is anyone that
want's one pretty much wants the other too. How many &quot;mild&quot; cams with 330
degrees of duration would you sell? How many HOT cams with 220 # .050&quot; (not
many).
