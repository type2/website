Subject: RE: [T2] Where to buy fuel line clamp

Ever had the golf tee come out for whatever reason.  Makes a real mess until
you find it and plug it in again. If you are working in your garage, near a
furnace or hot water heater, your house could go up in flames. This actually
happened to a neighbor of mine when messing with a dune buggy. Lost his
whole house (no one was hurt thank GOD). Safety pays...... (and we all know
how much Frank likes fires)
IIRC- Muir also recommends the 009.... Ted

Don't take life to seriously -- you'll never live throught it....
