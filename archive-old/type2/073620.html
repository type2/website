&gt;I have my engine out now and I'd like to put it on the stand.  I have an
&gt;engine stand that I borrowed from a friend, but when I try to put it
&gt;onto the engine, the clutch gets in the way.  

You need the VW engine stand adapter. Most of the VW vendors have them.
Even the one I got from JC Whipme years ago works well. Also, you could try
some bushings and longer bolts with the standard type mount, but in my
experience the standard type arms will not swing to the proper orientation
to center the VW motor so it is reasonably balanced.
