Subject: Loose mixture screw

Well 2 days into Mr Whipy's resurection &amp; I need help. The mixture screw
keeps winding out &amp; making the the mix too rich. Can I use PTFE plumbers
tape around the threads? How about thread lock fluid (need this for all the
tire F.A.R.T's). Any ideas needed as we want to try him out this week end!
