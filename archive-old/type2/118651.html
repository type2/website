Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel Pump...NOT

Turbulence = resistance = less flow.  So I guess we are both right in a
way.  Good way of thinking of that though.
 
I did notice that the CO screw has little effect on the mixture at
engine speeds above approx 1800 RPM.  I had to tweak the spring tension
to get my mixture within spec above that.
