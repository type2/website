Subject: Re: [T2] Splittie profiteering

Gray Baskerville was a Hot Rod Magazine writer for over 30 years, he drove the same car the whole time, I think it was a '32 Ford that still had the fenders, i read an article about the car after he died and they had a thing about him saying that it had gone in and out of style 3 times while he worked there and there were times when he would hear the young guys snickering at him in the parking lot for driving it, it is very cool, its a driver, another great story is about him getting invited to the 50th Anniversary Oakland Roadster Show after they had heard about the cars history, he showed up and the refused him entry because of the primer spots and worn upholstery.

It is amazing, my mom drove a 1964 Mustang, 1964 Falcon, and 1968 Cougar when I was little, because we were poor.

I bet guys that have been driving their bay around 30 years have felt the in and out of style and been snickered at, but you always knew you were cool.

&gt; Then - I think the price of the car is at it highest when the 'collectors' 
&gt; are between the ages of .... say 45 and 65 ... and many of those people are 
&gt; buying cars that were around when they were kids .. I think ... buses will 
&gt; go up and up in price .. until they reach a plateau and then prices will 
&gt; either drop or level off and not keep up with inflation.
