If you haven't done this repair before, you will probably need to pick 
up a socket that fits the sensor.  I'm not sure what the size is as I'm 
not near my garage, but I'm sure someone here will chime in.  Also, when 
you screw it in, screw it in until it stops and turn it a little bit 
more until it feels secure, but that's it.  It's a pipe thread so 
there's a taper in the thread.  You have to be really careful about 
stripping the thread.
