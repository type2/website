Subject: runon after stop

my idle is high, fuel mixture is adjusted optimally
timing is on, clearances are correct.
i have a small hole in my muffler,

it runs as though there is a piston slightly off stroke
until it warms up very good,
and after a fairly long steady run at 55-60 it 
dies to almmost stop, and fires back up again for what
sounds like one cycle. after teh key is off that is.

any suggestions to this runon thing would be appreciated.
idle high thing is not so bad, i had a low idle before teh last
adjustments so that it was dying on mme.
still, the idle cannot be adjusted any lower. the screw
is off the throttle arm - not touching where it normally 
rests against...

engine runs cool and smooth at higher speeds, hwy 5, 101, 
etc. sounds fantastic, just can't figure the runon...

hot cylynder?

pardon the typos, my wrist is broken in a cast.
does not ake repairs/restorations very easy.
not to menton typing.

thanks in advance.
