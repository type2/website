Subject: Re: [T2] distributor replacement

Nathan,
Before you're pummeled by the list about the 009, check the archives
for your distributor choice.  The 009 is not the best for T4's.  T1's
with stock carb is just as bad.  Lack of advance is the culprit, as I
recall.

The Kads have to be ported for vacuum signal, I would strongly suggest
the pro's do it.  John at aircooled_dot_net offers a choice SVDA distributor
that might work for you.

Good luck,

Simon Ramirez Jr.

&gt; My 1974 1800cc with dual Kadrons has a 009 distributor, I would like
&gt; to 
&gt; replace it with a better one. Would the original dist. work well with
&gt; the 
&gt; Kadrons? and how would I get the vacuum for it to run correctly (where
&gt; to I 
&gt; tap into)? Or is there a better dist. out there? 050?
&gt;
