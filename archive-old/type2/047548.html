&gt;Greetings. Was wondering what the expected life span (MTBF) of a rebuilt
&gt;Bosch 55amp. alt. was. Put one in my ' 78 Westy four months ago, and just
&gt;lost one of the three diodes in the pack today. The original alt. lasted 105k
&gt;mi. Do the rebuilds from Bosch suck, or did I just get a bad one?

My Bosch rebuilt has lasted about 8 months now, no problem.  The cheapo
rebuilt before it only lasted three weeks.  Yours should have come with a
one year warranty straight from Bosch, I'd use it and hope you just got a
lemon.
