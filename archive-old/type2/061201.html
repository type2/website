Objet : BN4 gaz heater project






Hi

I dismantled a rescued late BN4 to restore it like a new one.  I came to a
point where all the parts are appart.  One of the objectives is to remove
all the spiders nests or other bugs (bébittes).  I took the stainless tube
alone to the bath and use water to cleen it.  Then I realised that I was
removing something from the inside of the combustion chamber.  It is a
lining who was fitted on the inside of the combustion chamber, directly on
the stainless.  The texture looks like an ice cream cone. I think it could
be a refractory material use to control overheating of the stainless due to
direct rediation of the flame or it could be some king ok sponge use to
absorb the fuel that overflow.

My questions are:

What is that?

What is it for?

What obout if I run the heater without it?

Any suggestion for a remplacement material and precedure?

I took over 50 pictures of my work on the heater and if there is some
interest, I will put a page on my web site.  See URL at the end.
