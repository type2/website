Subject: Stripped cylinder head studs

A friend of mine found out that the threads were
stripped out on the case of her 1500 SP (66 bus) where
the cylinder head studs go into the case. So I
suggested she get some self-tapping replacement studs,
which she did. Unfortunately, when the old studs came
out, she discovered that they WERE the self tapping
studs, so it had already been done ane they stripped
out to.  So does she have any options other than
getting a new engine case??  Are there any kind os
timeserts or heliocoils that can be installed into the case??

Peace, John Baker
