Hmmm... well, different cars, different experiences.  I had continuing
problems with the copper rings between the exhaust manifold and head.
After a couple of go-rounds with replacing them, I ran out of time once
and brought the job to a shop.  The mechanic told me that (a) the reason
that the rings failed and (b) the reason that the studs were so out of
line was the missing hangers.  According to him, after a period of time,
the weight of the exhaust system pulling on the hot manifolds warps them. 
With the holes no longer parallel, the manifold becomes difficult to
remove and install and since the faces of the ports are no longer at 90
degrees to the heads, the rings don't seal like they ought and eventually
fail. He refaced the ends of the manifolds and then bored the holes for
the studs slightly larger and all held for a long time thereafter.  I have
since had similar experiences on other vans, so I figure he knew what he
was doing.

Another responder, Karl Von Saltzen (aufever_at_hotmail_dot_com), wrote of cracks
forming in the manifold, which has not been my experience, but which I can
well believe. I, like him, have seen many broken and welded manifolds in
junk yards, just never thought this was why.  The only time I have had to
deal with a broken manifold, it was on a van that had been backed into a
tree *hard*, which explained the damage for me :-) 

(He also wrote that my dyslexia had struck again {which was true :-})
switch right and left as you re-read my original post, the alternator is
behind the passenger, not the driver :-)

&gt; My apologies to the friendly list admin.  :-)

None needed, every van is different, and the larger the universe of data,
the more accurate our judgements.  One thought that occurs, your van has
triangle-port attachment for the muffler?  or trapezoid ports?  I wrote as
if this applied to all T4's, but it may only be for the 76-78 style
exhaust.  Since the 72-75 and 79 have the manifold and heat exchanger
combined, there may not be a need for these supports.

Lastly, someone asked for a better description of the hangers, and I will
post that tomorrow night (going out tonight to have a *fast* time :-)
