Subject: VIN number

The VIN on my '67 (287019561) doesn't seem to match any of the VINs on
lists I've seen.  Judging by replies to my interior questions, it is a 
standard microbus (the fancy interior looks VERY original).  The bus 
doesn't have back-up lights though, which I understand were standard on 
'67s.  My title says the original factory list price was $2,337 if that 
helps (though I have no idea how the AZ dept of trans got this value), 
and it also claims the bus was first registered in Nov '67 (so it's 29 
this month!)

I appreciate any replies,

Matthew F.
