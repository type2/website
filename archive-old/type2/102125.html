Subject: Re: [T2] bleeding clutch question

I've used the &quot;Gravity Bleed&quot; system for my previous Vanagons. As the clutch 
slave cyl. sits quite a bit lower than the reservoir for the same, it works 
just fine. Pop the cap off the fluid res. crack the slave bleeder and keep an 
eye on the fluid level in the res, top it off after you've had a beer, and 
your done. This trick makes up for the BS one must go through to bleed the 
freaking coolant system on a H2O boxer powered Vanagon.
