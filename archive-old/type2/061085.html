&gt; you get on a scale.

Not too hard to do.  The worst you can do is to get it up on two
wheels, which doubles the vertical load on the tires.  It also adds a
side load of (assuming really sticky tires) about the same as the
vertical load.

Good 'ol Pythagoras says that the resultant of these two equal
perpendicular forces is about 1.4 times the forces themselves so if
you multiply it out you get that the total loading is about 2.8 times
the static load.

To this you can add the momentary loading caused by hitting a sharp
bump in a sharp dip in the road and so on and so on... :)

Fact is, the dynamic loading can go way beyond the static value, which
is taken into account by the tire manufacturers.  Tires can (and are
expected to) take far more load than that printed on the sidewall, but
only for very short periods of time.  

The load rating is just a guideline to follow, which relates the
strength of the tire to an easily measured value, the weight of the
bus on that tire.  

I doubt that anyone wants to instrument their bus to determine the
actual maximum load force applied to a single tire (well, maybe BH
&lt;g&gt;) so the static load number is the best way to go.
