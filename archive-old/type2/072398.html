Subject: Re: [T2] need help with rust - FOUND

Thanks to everyone for the info.
Well it took quite a bit but I finally did find a zinc chromate primer. DuPont makes one, the place selling it was listed in the yellow pages under Automobile Body Shop Equipment &amp; Supplies. This place seems like the only one around that has the zinc chromate. It sells for $18.11 / spray can, he did refer me to a product called Extend which is only $7 / spray can. 
Has anyone heard of Extend? I'm guessing that its this product:

Also while looking for Extend I found something called Corroless, has anyone heard of this?

thanks.
todd.
