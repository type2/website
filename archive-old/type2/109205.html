Subject: Weird Wipers

I recently bought new wiper blades for the bus and am puzzled as to the
performance.  I searched the Library and the Archives, but couldn't seem to
find the info that I need.

Granted, I got 16&quot; blades and had to trim the plastic rail on the blade (but
not the blade itself) a bit to make them fit, and their not OEM.  (I was
navigating a storm and had to see where I was going at the time, so please
be forgiving.)

The wiper arms are working fine mechanically, but with the new blades the
driver's side blade wipes partially on the up stroke and then completely (as
designed) on the down stroke.  On the passenger side the blade only wipes
partially on both strokes, leaving a swath of unwiped windshield between the
ends of the blade.

I know that the problem is probably the stiffness of the blades combined
with the curvature of the windshield, but I'm loath to do anything to the
blade arms themselves without asking here first.

Thanks for any help.
