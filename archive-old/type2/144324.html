&gt; Hello.
&gt;
&gt; Is there any difference in quality of the seat stand mats from either Bus
&gt; Depot, Wolfsburg West, or CIP1??

Quality of mats, I don't know.  Quality of service would make me go with
Bus Depot or Old Volks Home.

When was the last time you saw anyone from CIP1 posting to the list?
