&gt; I am working on getting my charcoal canister set up to vent my fuel lines
on my 74 Westy, 1800cc.  I am in need of the pipe that comes out of the left
side of the fan housing that goes to the canister.  Mine is missing and is
currently plugged.  If anyone hase one of these, let me know how I can
aquire it from you.

Hi Ed,
Kinda hard to explain it but......it depends on the year of the bus/
location of the cannister as to whether you are supposed to have the tube on
the left end of the fan housing. [This is pertains to USA buses with the
type IV engine] In the early years, 74 to 76? the charcoal cannister was
mounted in the right corner above the battery. 77-78 it was mounted on the
left side of the gas tank panel. 79 it went back up in the right. 77-78 had
the tube on the left end to go to the left end of the cannister. The early
ones and 79's got the hose tube connection from the 1/2 upper cylinder head
tin. I put a couple of pics of it here:

This is a 79 Cal version I had laying around. You will see the tube sticking
out forward of #2 spark plug hole. There are 2 versions of this tin. 77-78
does not have the tube.
Yes, people mis-match the fan housing and tin all the time....
Where is your cannister mounted?
