Subject: I got my motor...

Hi all...

I jushad to write.  My motor came in (finally) on Wednesday, so once I can 
get Lily back out of storage (my uncle was putting her up to keep me out of 
tickets!) We'll be rolling again.

I have *never* pulled a 2 liter with FI.  does anyone have experience they 
can pass on to this newbie on what I should and shouldn't do, how to keep all 
the wires straight, and stuff?

Any info helps - you might want to send it P-mail to keep the list from 
overlaoding!

Thanks a million,
Susanne

(and Lily... soon to be on the road again!)
