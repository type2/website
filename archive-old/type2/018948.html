Hi Isaiah-  If your brakes didn't drag, the pistons should move.
    Lacking fancy clamps, I've always pushed the pistons back to get the
pads out using a wooden wedge that is tapped in with a small sledge
hammer- actually I do this on each side of the disk equally, to  cause
no undue force on just one side of the disk.  The wedges can be cut from
any hard wood.  2 Pickle forks (tie rod separators) could also be used,
but don't force them between piston and pad or you might cut the
telescoping rubber of the piston seals.  If you have the pads out and
want to push the pistons in for new ones, slip them back in to act as
spacers against the piston, using the wedge between the disk and
spacer.  I remember also using a small &quot;cat's paw&quot; pry bar to push on
the hollow center of the piston and force it back in further when the
pads were out.
