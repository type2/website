&gt;I am thinking hard about whether or not to rebuild or replace my engine.
&gt;I live in Las Vegas and I'm interested to know if anyone has good or bad

&gt;another? 

I know of an excellent VW mechanic in Vegas - it is Meyers Foreign (702-457-2966 3552 Boulder Hwy)

They do excellent work at fair prices and are one of the few places in the US that I would trust to do work on my bus.

Not sure if they will rebuild an engine or not.
