Subject: RE: [T2] Shocks for Van = Shocks for Bay?

&gt; I don't know much about them at all. I was hoping someone 
&gt; with experience with both might know if they would fit.


While I haven't tried it myself, I'd be very surprised if they could be
interchanged. They are completely different part numbers, both from VW
and in the aftermarket. Even the aftermarket shock manufacturers (i.e.
KYB), who are usually quite adept at making one shock fit as many
applications as possible (so they can produce fewer SKU's), list a
totally different shock for the Bus vs. the Vanagon.
