7.  I can work on the underneath stuff without a jack.
6.  I have never had to get out of it and walk (unwillingly).
5.  It makes people happy to see it.
4.  It makes people happy to ride in it.
3.  Other old VW owners are usually friendly.
2.  Nearly everyone has owned an old VW and wants to tell me about it.
