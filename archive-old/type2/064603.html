That's a lot of money, even Canadian.  The disadvantage to the single carb
is the long pipes needed to get the air fuel mixture to the heads.  I've
heard of people having bad icing problems with a single carb.  I wouldn't
do it without also rigging a way to get some heat to the pipes in the cold.
I think you would be better off with some high performance dual carbs and
manifolds.  I'm kind of sold on the stock carbs at this point - they have a
lot of advantages, the main one being that they are STOCK.  If you decide
to swap, can I have your old Solexes?  :-)
