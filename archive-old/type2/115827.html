&gt; Interesting point. I have just been told by two Australian VW places the
&gt; fixed ones are NLA.

Strewth!

&gt; I hadn't thought about fitting two adjustable ones though, sounds like a
&gt; good solution. Any brands to stay clear of??

Without thinking about it, anything from Mexico or South America.

The Meyle (of Germany) ones are made in Italy.

&gt; On the issue of steering, I have also been told it's worth replacing the
&gt; 'centre steering pin' if your going through the whole steering system.
&gt; What's involved in replacing this?

That sounds like all the parts that make up the relay lever.
