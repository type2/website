Subject: RE: [T2] SVDA with Stock 34PDSIT carbs

Within reason, does it really matter what dizzy goes with what fuel delivery 
system?

Obviously some outrageous combinations may not work, but moderate 
improvements in advance curve and/or carburation shouldn't interfere with 
each other should they?

I would think the cam performance would be more affected by either...
