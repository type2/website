Subject: Re: [T2] replacing fuel lines and lifter noise

Hi Marcus,

DO NOT ignore that hose. It's as prone to leaks as any other  
pressurized hose on the bus, maybe more so.

When I replace these lines I cut the crimps off with a dremel tool  
and replaced them with a fi hose clamp. If you take the injectors to  
a rebuilder you can get new lines crimped onto them.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; the
&gt; injector side. What do folks usually do about this? Simply ignore  
&gt; this last
&gt; stretch of hose?
