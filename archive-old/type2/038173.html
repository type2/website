Subject: Re: Westy sink (early 70's)

The other is.....the drain vent pipe. It goes up and vents out the roof and
thru the pop top. I will see if I can find a picture.




&gt; I recently purchased a VW van that the PO had install the Westy interior,
poor job I might add.  The sink has two holes that I would like someone to
tell me what they are for.  (The guy never hooked the sink up).  Please
don't tell me they are for the drain and faucet.  I have already identified
those.  I'm guessing one is to fill the water jug, which I don't have, (can
someone give me the specs on it) and the other is..........
