Correction !

In my original web-page on tires I made an error. George Lyle kindly pointed
out to me that I based my calculations on a 185/75R14 tire while the
standard size on our buses is 185R14. The absence of a slash and a number
indicates the default value of 82%, giving a slightly higer side wall. I
redid the math and the corrected page is already in place.

See : http://www.hrps_dot_demon.nl/jwbus/T2-tires.htm

More feedback is appreciated!

Since this information also applies to Vanagons can someone please crosspost
it there (I'm not on their list anymore).
