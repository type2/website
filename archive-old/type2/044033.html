&gt;Listees,
&gt;
&gt;I am curious to know what you think about the oil temp guage versus the 
&gt;cylinder head temp guage. What are your opinions?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks

You don't say what kind of engine you have but I think that the cylinder 
head sensors are more for those with fuel injection.  I would think that
the oil temp gauge would be fine if all you're looking to do is measure
the longer term heating of your engine.  You already know that the 
cylinder head temp is going to be hotter then the oil and as long as 
you have a good working cooling system it would just be *somewhat* 
duplicate information.  YMMV.
