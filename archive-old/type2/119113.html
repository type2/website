Subject: Re: [T2] Reattaching oil pickup in a 1600cc engine

T4 oil pick-up is different from T1. The screen cover is held with
a single center nut, and the pick-up is suspended with a  bolt
through the case halves. There is risk of breaking the case web
from overtorquing the cover fastener, and another from stripping
the threads in the case when overtorquing the pick-up mounting
fastener, or galling the case threads when removing one.

&gt; &gt; Hello Guys   It can be done but you will have to bend the pickup plate some
&gt; &gt; to be able to get in there , run the stud in then attach the nut to a box
end
&gt; &gt; wrench using dum-dum or 3 m wheatherstip glue after tightening re bend the
&gt; &gt; plate back in to shape.I would also use locktite and a lock washer here.
Not the
&gt; &gt; prettiest way but way better than tearing the motor down.   later and have
fun
&gt;
&gt; is this only for a 1600 engine or will it work also on a 2liter engine
