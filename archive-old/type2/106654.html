Subject: Re: [T2] T IV Valves

Doc Tim is spot on. Another thing to think about this summer. Those of us 
running the engine hard and hot like on the interstate and then stopping 
for food and gas. I believe if you shut the engine off while it is really 
HOT it will &quot;hot soak&quot; and the engine temps will go up for a while after 
the engine is stopped and this can lead to valve seat problems. Back off 10 
mph for the last minutes pre-stop, or at least idle the engine for a few 
minutes after you stop. Dump some of that heat.
