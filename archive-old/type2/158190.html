A  clogged fuel filter can act just like the old governors on 
rental  cars  -  motor stumbles severely when you raise cruise speed  
above a given value  -  say 45 mph.  Ease off and the motor  resumes.
Does yours recover reliably when you slow to, say,  40 mph?




I put on a new Bosch fuel filter and opened the bleeder between 3&amp;4  
cylinder. I'm getting plenty of fuel.
