Subject: Bad a/c compressor

On my friend's 72 bus, the receipts show that the a/c compressor wasn't
working as far back as 1984. The repair shop wrote that they couldn't
pinpoint the problem and recommended replacement which the PO must have
decided was too expensive to fix.

When I dropped the engine and the compressor was no longer obscured by the
frame it was pretty clear what had gone wrong:

What a piece of junk.
