 I got a side mounted DOMETIC awning from CAMPING WORLD (they have stores
and catalog) back in '94 for our 78 Westy'ws 10,000 mi trip out of NJ.
Bought the van gutter clips to attach it, but got the 12 fr version so I
could fasten the front (with a spacer and bolt) to the luggage rack and
also have room to hang the stock tent from it when I wanted an enclosed
space.  It pulls out as far as the stock tent is wide.  Saves carrying all
those heavy poles, and acts as a fly and a roof so the tent isn't soaked
when you break it up in the rain.  If you don't plan to do this, the
lighter 10 ft version is easier to roll/unroll.  The awning was great for
shading the side of the bus (I parked so driver side was naturally shaded)-
you can extend it just 3 feet in a parking lot and tie the feet to the tire
rims.
     At the time there wasn't a store close to us, so I had it delivered.
The carrier smashed one end, And since I had to leave, decided to mount it
and replace it at a Camping World in Ohio.  Learned then what the wind can
do- to undo the screws from the clips one must extend the awning, and being
on blacktop, I just stood the front legs down and while standing on the
stool to undo the screws, the wind picked it up and blew it right over the
poptop!  Bent it up a lot-  so in putting on the new one I made sure
someone was holding on to it!
   The material seems to be a plasticized cloth- has stood up well.  The
front legs fold up and lock the cover down.  My only beef is that the
awning rolled up can shift sideways a bit so the legs don't fold readily
into their cover-locking groove (located in the endcaps), but you can just
whack the end to recenter it.  Also, if on blacktop, you can bungee/tie the
leg bottoms to the tires (or use the clips that screw to the body, which I
didn't).  If storms might come in overnite, run a cord over the awning end
to end to prevent liftup if the ground pegs come loose.   Water can collect
between the roof arms if you don't have it angled well down in rain.  (You
can angle one end high, other low).  MB
