Subject: Giacomo Lives!!! :O)

Topped off Giacomo's battery today in order to start another round of trying
to get him to start, and bingo!  On the first turn of the key.  Sweet!

Now the question is &quot;What did I do wrong the last time?!&quot;

Ah well, at least I'm halfway home to actually making Giacomo my daily
driver. :O)

I inadvertently deleted your post, but a &quot;thanks&quot; to the listee who told me
to pry on the plastic and not the metal ring to get the horn button off.
