Subject: Re: [T2]oil filler cap seal

If you are slinging oil out between the filler tube
and the plastic neck, you don't need a seal.
You need new rings, you have TOO much crankcase
pressure.

 can someone tell me what size the seal is that goes
 inside the tube for the oil filler cap .
  
 i am talking about when you take pliars to the metal
 clamp and pull the whole thing off the plastic part
 up inside the black plastic there is suppose to be a
 seal that goes there?
  
 i found that the large size pushrod tube seal will
 fit it but is to fat and want let the oil filler cap
 go all the way down correctly on the metal sooooooo
 what can i use here&gt;?
 its causing oil to sling out everywhere and i even
 tried sealent but that doesnt hold but a day course
 thats without any kind of seal at all and just
 sealent.
  
 its a small ring looks just like a pushrod seal but
 thinner.
