Subject: [T2] External Oil Cooler Kits Whose to Use?

&gt; Oil temps on the bus have approaced 250
&gt;That's not very hot... if you have good oil pressure and synthetic oil.

So how about those Oil temps???? (Flame suit on)

&gt;I think I will mount the cooler under the cargo floor area of the
&gt;bus horizintally.

&gt;How are you planning on protecting it from road hazards?

My bus (78 Westy) had air conditioning when I got  it. Well it was not
working but most of the stuff was there. Under the cargo floor area of the
bus was the evaporator/condenser whatever the hell that thing is. I removed
it but it was not in bad shape at all and it had lived there most likely
since 78. I would imagine a good quality cooler could survive the same
treatment. The condenser did have some fans mounted on it, don't think I
will use these with the oil cooler. Plan to intall a thermostat later this
summer before fall.

Any other thoughts here folks? I have not had much of a response to this
question and I would think you southern bus folks would be all over this
one...
