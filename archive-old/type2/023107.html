Thanks for all of the friendly and fairly entertaining advise.  I knew that 
one of the first things I wanted to do, was to replace all of the fuel 
lines...I just never thought--mice chew, hmmm fuel lines...

Anyway, since this morning, I have upgraded my AAA membership to the Plus 
(100 mile tow.)  I've decided to sweep out as many droppings and the nest 
tomorrow and have the bus towed from MD to VA.  I planned on having it be 
my traveling home for 6 months later this year, so I don't want to take any 
&quot;fire&quot; chances.

I'll replace all of the lines next week before I drive it anywhere.

Oh, yeah...anyone have any used Bentley manuals for sale?  I need one for a 
'76 and a '80 (newer engine, older bus.)

Thanks again everyone!
Missy:)
