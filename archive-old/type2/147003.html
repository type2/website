Subject: Oktoberbus site updated

http://www.crazyauntiesherry_dot_com/Oktobus/OktoberBus.html

I updated the site with cost (a next to nuthin' $10. per bus) and a real 
road name (at least that's what the sign at the end of the dirt road says).

I was working on the site yesterday and Walter was saying how excited he 
is to host us this year.  He seems to think I'm a typical moonie, and I 
didn;t have the heart to explain that none of us are exactly &quot;typical&quot;.  
His son has a bus, alas it's &quot;resting&quot;, but he may still show up.  I 
also expect some non-bus folks who remember us from 2001 at the old place.
