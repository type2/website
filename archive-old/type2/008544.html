RE: The Six Large Case Nuts
Tom,
	As a fastener engineer (yes there is such a thing), I recommend
in a special application such as case nuts, that you obtain the genuine
item.  You would not believe all the special parts that are created to
solve application problems.  It could be quite possible that &quot;standard&quot;
(whatever that means) are fine, but I personally  (being a fastener
engineer) would not follow that route.  

The 10.9 on the bolt heads is the strength grade which indicates it is
heat treated to tensile stress on 1030 MPa (Newtons / mm^2) -
approximately 150,000PSI which is basically equal to an SAE &quot;inch&quot; grade
8 - follow?   The .9 indicates that the yeild strength is 90% of the
ultimate tensile strength.   The nuts could be of lesser stress grade, an
equal stress grade or a greater stress grade.  

One thing that was evident to me on my Vanagon motor was the thickness of
these nuts.  They are much greater than the nut thickness than the
typical nut.  I can guess at reasons, but you can be pretty sure that VW
determined that the nuts needed to be this thick.  I would be highly
suspect of the quality of hardware store nuts for this application.  The
German fastener manufacturers that supply the auto industry are very
quality aware and are serious manufacturers.  (Would you believe that
almost every German fastener manufacturer that supplies the auto industry
has a PHd on the staff! -I don't think you can find one in the U.S.!)  

Also if the nuts were nuts were not made of the correct material, it is
conceivable that the engine temperature could &quot;temper&quot; them - that is
reduce their hardness and strength until they failed. Sorry for the long
post, I just know that special fasteners are built that way for good
reasons and I'd hate to see you have problems - price them out at your
FLAPS and the dealer - it's probably well worth it

--Thanks for the exposition - it was very well done!

--I called a VWofA parts department yesterday and asked about this nut
and 
--was told that it was just a &quot;standard&quot; steel nut.  But, given my 
--experience with VWofA parts departments (nearly universally bad - they 
--must specially train these guys) I think I'll walk into a different 
--dealership and ask this question again.
