Scott,
    I have a 78 9 seater and I have towed pop up trailers, bugs and even a
broken down bus with it.  Granted that I never Towed the bus further than 10
miles, but I have towed a pop up trailer many, many miles.  The main problem
you encounter with towing is wind resistance.  Fortunately for us, the bus
blocks most of this on the low profile popups.  Of, course I live in
Oklahoma, so it may be much different if you have a lot of hills to pull the
added weight up and over.
    Interesting point though, my bus came with a factory installed trailer
hitch.  It attatches to the rear engine support and the frame.  Tounge
wieght must not exceed 500 lbs. and gross weight not to exceed 1200.
Perfect for a modern pop-up..

&gt; If I get a travel trailer, I will have to buy a bigger truck than I
&gt; currently have to tow it and haul all the kids. For my situation, a
Vanagon
&gt; Westy, or maybe a 76-79 Bay Westy is going to be my best bet. I may try to
&gt; tow a loaner pop-up tent trailer and see how the bus does. I am just
afraid
&gt; that the trans give up on me.

&gt;
&gt; With a proper hitch your camper can tow a lightweight tent trailer without
&gt; difficulty.  That might be an alternative to swapping the Westfalia for a
&gt; Winnebago :-)

&gt; &gt;&gt;  But at the moment my wife wants me to tow a pop-up railer behind the
bus
&gt; so we will have the room.  I told her no-way, it will kill the poor Bus.
