Subject: Type 4 into 67 Kombi

First of all thanks to all who replied to my post about what engine I should
put into my 67 Kombi. Well I've decided to use my good running 75 1.8 bus
engine and convert it to an upright. I've sent off to NexGen for the manual,
heard about two or three different suppliers of alternator stands and
fanshrouds(type1 and type 4). I would again like to solicit opinions from
the list about experiences anyone has had with any of these products.
My target date is to have Creepy Crawler done and ready to go to the show in
Las Vegas in late September. I'll be cramming my wife,5of the 6 kids, and
swap stuff in ane on the bus(don't know who will ride where yet just depends
on who's being good at the time) so I'm looking to keep the engine
coooooolll.
TIA    Britt...in Calif.
