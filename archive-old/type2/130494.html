Subject: Stuff to bring to Buses Of The Corn.

Hi Volks,

We're down to just TWO WEEKS until Buses of the Corn. The recent wet
weather in these parts is starting to clear up and the cornfields are
growing so fast that the farmers have to be careful where they park the
tractors! BOTC is growing fast too -- 40-something buses have already
confirmed their attendance.

Here are a few suggestions to have a good time at BOTC.


THINGS TO BRING TO BOTC:

1. A Bus.
Any year VW is welcome, from the barn door splitty to EuroVan. Bring a
sunroof, camper, panel, kombi, double-door or singlecab. Vanagons &amp;
Rialta's are welcome too. It doesn't have to be a camper, there is
plenty of room for tents or trailers if you want to bring one. I've
heard there's going to be practically a sea of side-tents at BOTC this
year with all sorts of makes and models in use.

2. The Family.
BOTC is not a judged show &amp; shine held on a hot asphalt parking lot.
It's not a 48-hour party for hopped-up hooligans (;-P.) BOTC is a VW
camping event with something for the whole family. I'm bringing my wife
and kids and I'd be happy to have you bring yours too. The kid-friendly
activities will include frisbee golf, crafts, Tie-Dye workshop,
afternoon water fight and scavenger hunt.

3. A Leash
If you're bringing a pet, bring a leash too.  Campground regulations
state that pets have to stay on a leash. Thanks.

4. A red cup. (Or other beverage container)
Campground rules prohibit alcohol on-site. If you're gonna bring it
anyway, I don't want the ranger to see it. &quot;Just keep it cool&quot;. &quot;Nuff
said.

5. Door Prizes.
If you have something nifty to contribute, bring it along. We have a
fair number of items already, but more are always welcome.

6. Food.
We now have an ONLINE sign-up sheet for the Breakfast Burritos at:
http://www.pottsfamily_dot_ca/burrito/index.htm
Visit the page, review the list and tell us what you plan to contribute.
Along with the Burrito Breakfast, we'd also like people to bring a side
dish or dessert to share at the corn roast.

7. Something to swap.
No, I'm not talking about your significant other!!  But if you have a
spare VW part you'd like to sell or trade for something you're more in
need of, BOTC is the place to do it. Swap meet space is free to
registered campers, and the swap meet starts after the Burrito
Breakfast on Saturday.

8. Something to Tye-Dye.
Also free to registered campers is the Saturday morning Tie-Dye
Workshop. We will have a small quantity of BOTC T-shirts available for
purchase on-site but if you prefer to bring your own item to dye you
are welcome to do so. If you want to pre-order a shirt please email me
with size information and I will tell you where to send the $$$.

9. A musical instrument.
Bring it to the Friday and Saturday night campfire and we'll have a
good time.

10. Quarters,
One reason for the cheap camp fees is that the showers are
pay-as-you-go. Less than a buck's worth will get you squeaky-clean!


DON'T BRING: (a much shorter list)

1. Electrical Appliances.
Our campsite doesn't include hookups. Please plan to camp with propane
and 12V. The electricity that is available is already reserved for
group cooking and medical purposes.
(If you need electricity for medical reason please email off-list)

2. Fireworks.
That includes engine cases. Campground regulations prohibit fireworks
and firearms.


WHEN IS IT?
Just two weeks from today. Gates open officially at noon on Friday
August 6th, and close at noon on Sunday August 8th.

HOW DO I GET THERE?

BOTC is held just north of Whitby Ontario Canada, half an hour's drive
east of Toronto. GPS Co-ordinates: 43.9292 78.9812

Exit 401 at Brock St. (HWY 12) in Whitby. Go North on Brock St. 3.5
miles to Taunton Rd.
Turn left onto Taunton Rd and go West from Brock St. about a half-mile
to Country Lane Rd.
Turn right on Country Lane Rd. and go North about 1 mile to the end.
Turn right and go East on Lyndebrook Rd.  Follow Lyndebrook about 100
yards to a parking lot with a gate on the right.
Open the gate, drive through, close the gate behind you. Follow the
gravel road about half a mile to the group camping area.

There's a map on the website if you prefer to see it drawn out:

WHAT DOES IT COST?
Thanks to our friends at GermanSupply_dot_com we are able to offer a whole
weekend of VW fun for only $8 CDN if you hurry and get the $$ to me
before the end of the month.
That ridiculous low price includes the campsite, swap meet space, Tie
Dye workshop and the Cornroast. It doesn't include flush toilets
though, so don't say we never warned you. I can assure you that
outhouses are clean and in good repair, but if you're squeamish I would
recommend you bring your own porta-potti or plan to drive out to the
Tim Horton's at the corner.
After July 31st the registration fee goes up to $10.
