&gt;&gt; hey an answer would be great
&gt;&gt; my horn is disconnected and if I connect the horn it comes on at random
&gt;&gt; intervals
&gt;&gt; I have been tempted to do what yoour PO did and rewire the horn withan
&gt;&gt; external button.

&gt;My experiance has been that the wire inside the sterring Column rubs raw
&gt;so all the insulation is worn of the wire ...
&gt;When you make a turn the wire moves inside the stering column and grounds out
&gt;causing the horn to go off.  THats what happened to mine, i just unhooked 
&gt;the horn because its a pain in the butt to replace the wire ....

My was wasn't much better. I purchased one of those really big white horn
buttons like they use on boats and mounted it on the dash, just up and left
of the steering wheel. I bypassed the wire in the steering column all
together. At least the horn works. There's probably a better way, but,
you're right. It's a pain in the ass.
