Subject: turn signal cancellation

------=_NextPart_001_0001_01C25FD2.444468A0

Almost forgot. My turn signals don't automatically cancel after making a =
turn any more. I have to manually shut them off. Can this be fixed, or do=
 I need a new switch. (this wasn't working before I tried to fix the horn=
, but I figured I should take care of it while I have everything apart no=
w.)

Thanks,
Kyle
