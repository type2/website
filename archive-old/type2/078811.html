Subject: Piston Questions

Hi,

   My name is Chris Huggins and I live in Boston Mass.
I just got my hands on a '73 type 2 bus with a dual
carb 1700cc type 4 engine in it. This is the first car
I've ever owned. I've been a bike advocate my whole
life. But when the bus was offered to me for free. I
thought it might be a good chance to learn some stuff
about internal combustion engine and if I was lucky
have a vehicle that could haul me and my bikes around
on occaission. I already ordered a new head for the
one that was cracked from VW Goldmine in CA but I
still need four new pistons and rings. They have them
in california but shipping would cost too much and I
want to try and find them closer. Does anyone know
what the best pistons to use are and where I could get
them in the New England area?
