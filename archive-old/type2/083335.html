Subject: threes questions

hello all,

cooled down a bit since my last post.

i have three questions that i am hoping i can get
answers to.

all questions pertain to 76 Westy &quot;BustedBreadLoaf&quot;

1. my shifter grinds into 3rd. grinding noise seems to
be coming from floor beneath shifter, any ideas,
anyone. searched archives to no avail.

2. i have negative camber in the rear wheels of my
bus. how can i fix this. also searched archives on
this topic, nothing.

3. finally in responding to a fellow listees question
i ended up with one of my own. in the Bentley Manual,
Section 5, Page 21 there is a blow up of the cooling
air system. the final four numbers 50 thru 54 all
refer to an &quot;extension shaft w/pulley&quot;. on the
following page Fig. 7-4  refers to an air pump of some
sort which seems to be related to the extension shaft.
what is this all about? can one still aquire these
items and if so, where? 

thanks in advance

Matty
