Subject: Re: [T2] 1973 vw automatic bus.. how to mount engine?

I have the 73 crossbar, but the Subaru engine sits lower in the compartment than
the VW did...

The subaru engine mount bolted on the trans end, one bolt in the bell
housing of the engine, one bolt in the crank case.  The kennedy
adaptor does not have the threaded bolt hole for the engine mount.
The adaptor is thinner than the subaru bellhousing, so there wouldn't
be room to drill a hole either...

so I'm using some thick angle iron, bolted to the engine case on the
underside, between the oil pan and the heads.  I'm using the &quot;rear&quot;
bolt hole that the subaru engine mount bolted to, and another hole
that was not used in the subaru (which is inline with the bolt
mentioned above, but to rear (pulley) of engine.

http://rich12345.tripod_dot_com/busaru/index.html

the red shows the subaru mount...  green = existing bolt holes
(although the kennedy adaptor does NOT have them)

on the right I show my angle iron...

it is shown from underside of engine.

I'll try &quot;somewhere in between&quot; as DurocShark has suggested.  I don't
want the tranny clunkin around on accel/decel.  I can easily modify
the bar if I get noise out of it..

some pics and more drawings in a bit.. thanks for the replies!

more pics are up.  You can see about 3/8&quot; gap between front trans mount rubber
and metal bracket.  pushing down on rear of engine closes this gap.
