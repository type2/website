Subject: Help! bus won't start after running out of gas

started up bus after picking up from an alignment. 
took slightly longer than usual, noticed gas was
really low (mechanics joyriding?) and drove directly
to the gas station, about 2 blocks.  as i was pulling
in bus ran out of gas.  confirmed i had run out of gas
cause i pushed to the pump, filled up over 1 gallons,
and then the bus wouldn't start.  changed fuel filter
,although other one seemed alright, pump sounds like
it is running when you turn the key.  Do i need to
prime the pump, or is something else the matter. 
Tried pop starting couple of times to no avail. 
please help
