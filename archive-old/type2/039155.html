Subject: 110 city power

Hi Volks,
I have been reading this list for a few months now and I feel am have
acquired a lot of info from reading other posts that have been directly
relative to me and my newly acquired '77 Westy.  This is my first post on
this list and I would like to thank you in advance for all of the
information I have/will gain from each of you.   I have a problem with my
city power connection where my stove and fridge don't seem to work when I am
hooked up to power from my house.  The PO said the city power connections
worked fine but I have had no such luck.  Is there more to the set up than
just hooking up the power cord and putting the switch on &quot;city Power&quot;
setting?  The bus is equipped with genuine westfalia parts and I feel like
it may just be user error.  Am I missing something obvious?  Thanks for the
help.
