Subject: Hydraulic lifter

Hi volks,
I am thomas with '74 air cooled bus ( standard 1.6 Ltr  ), I want to modify
engine lifter from standard type into hydraulic type.  As my near friend
information it should be modified engine it self.  Does anyone have
experience with hydraulic lifter modification...?

Regards,
Thomas
