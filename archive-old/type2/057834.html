Subject: Re: Oil Pressure sender install

&gt;Anyway, installed the VDO extension hose and mounted the sender to the
&gt;case.  Took me about 5 minutes to figure out the 'G' marking on the
&gt;sender went to the dummy light and the 'WK' terminal was for the gauge.
&gt;Why don't they document that??
&gt;
Are you sure?  On mine it's the other way around and it works perfectly.  
I figured G for Gauge when I hooked it up and it works...
