Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch-self-destruct-mode...

I'll bet either one of the arms on the throwout shaft came loose or the
pivot on the end of the arm wore out.  the fix is the same in either case,
replace the throwout shaft.

There are heavy duty shafts made for the dune buggy trade that are better
than the stock shafts.  Be sure to specify one for a bus transmission and
for your style of throwout bearing (probably early style)

&gt; Hey everyone... so...
&gt;     (1970 panel bus)  The other day, Friday, I was at work, and I went to
&gt; leave to run some errands..  I was going to back out of the parking space, so
&gt; I was all ready to go, pushed the clutch in, put it into reverse and then all
&gt; of a sudden it jerked backwards...  I was stomping on the clutch petal, and
&gt; it went to the floor with no effect.. then, the car stalled...  It felt like
&gt; the cable broke, but when I checked it out, the cable was fine, the linkage
&gt; was fine...  I was able to limp it back home without using the clutch..  When
&gt; i press the petal, it goes to the floor, and makes a whirring, almost
&gt; grinding sound..
&gt;     I figured it has to do with either the throw-out bearing, the pressure
&gt; plate or the little pivot arm.  My mechanic said the same thing..  I didnt
&gt; want to do the work myself, so im taking it to the mechanic.. does  $250-300
&gt; sound about right? too much?  i added the parts up, using RMMW, and for the
&gt; clutch, pressureplate, bearing, clips and arm, it came out to about $130, so
&gt; i guess 150-ish in labor sounds good?
&gt;     It was a hassle driving the 20 miles home on surface streets.. Thinking
&gt; about it now, it probably would have been easier on the freeway, cause the
&gt; only tricky part of driving with no clutch is when you have to stop...  It
&gt; was kinda fun though...
