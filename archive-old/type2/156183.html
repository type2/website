Subject: Bridgestone tire inflation

Nearly ten years ago I began to use the Bridgestone
RD603 tires on my bus.  These are 185R14, load range D
max load 1850 lbs _at_ 65 psi max  cold,  8-ply rating,
blah blah blah

I phoned Bridgestone this morning 800-847-3272 and
asked their advice regarding the tire inflation I
should use for my application.

1973 VW camper bus with GAWR 2227 lbs front/2800 lb
rear.
They said that this was not their intended application
for this product.  They intended the RD603 be used on
a
light truck with single or dual rear wheels.  However,
they also stated that it was suitable for the VW bus.
The reinforced sidewall would help with stability witn
a high center of gravity, like a loaded VW camper.

Depending on the load I will carry, they offered the
following tire inflation pressures and load ratings:
40 psi - 1390 lbs
45 psi - 1430 lbs
50 psi - 1570 lbs
55 psi - 1670 lbs
Ultimately, they suggested that I use 40 psi in front
and 55 psi in the rear.


I recall that a list member was inquiring about the
inflation pressures to use with a similar type of tire
made by Yokohama.?  You might want to call Yokohama
and
ask what they recommend for your vehicle.
Just another datapoint on the graph.  YMMV
