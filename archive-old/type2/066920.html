Subject: 77 bus, needs help...

Hi BusList,
I'm Karen, a friend of Gregor's.  I was hoping that someone might be able to
help me with a problem.  I'll be driving along in my 77 bus and without
warning it will start to die...the accelerator will still provide
resistance but it's as if there is no fuel reaching the engine.  Sometimes
I can pump the accelerator and the car will continue to run.  Other times
it stalls completely and I have to restart my bus. This is happening
more frequently and I am sure that soon it won't be running at
all.
Could this be a fuel injection problem and does anyone out there have any
ideas? Thanks for your help. ;)
Karen
