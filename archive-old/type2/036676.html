&gt; We were at my friend's VW shop today and we saw a
&gt; late 70's Bus with a lowered floor.  My kids said the middle
&gt; floor section was lowered about 4-5 inches.  It wasn't a pop-top,
&gt; but seemed to be a camper, although I'm not sure if it was
&gt; a Westy or some home brewed conversion.

I have one, check on the bus tour list and see if the photo's of mine
(Baltimore segment) looks like the one your kids saw. or if you are in the
tour I put the original ad for mine in the &quot;Chest&quot;

&gt; Was a lowered floor a factory option, or was this a custom job?

the only people I know that did this was HP BUS of Billurica(sp) Mass.
it apparently was only done on 75-79 automatic deluxe buses, there might
be a &quot;builders plate&quot; on the drop section near the latch for the drop
floor to the right of the door on the &quot;Sill&quot;  

mine is a 78 that was lowered between the wheels 9 inches.  the lowered
section had a fold down ramp piece at the door onto which the lower door
track is welded in the standard position.  These were sold as &quot;vehicles
for transport of the disabled&quot; or the original low floor van.  I am a
person with a disability and roll right into mine, then drive with hand
controls from the regular drivers seat.  the design was ingenious in that
a wheelchair seat is almost perfectly aligned with the drivers seat.

wonder if this is still used for the original purpose, this may be the
only other survivor that I am aware of.

the linkages etc to get past the lowered floor are very ingenious, but it
was one of the reasons ONLY automatics were ever lowered.
