&gt; My neighborhood &quot;FLAPS&quot; has Optima redtop &quot;blems&quot; on sale for $70 and $90,
&gt; depending on CCA.  They come with a 90 day warranty.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone know of any risks associated with buying a &quot;blem&quot;?  The price seems
&gt; good!

Yes. You risk the ostracism of your &quot;perfect&quot; battery pals.
Notice the warranty. The price reduction entitles
you to pocket the difference up front. I'll take two.
( Now you have to exchange it every 89 days).
