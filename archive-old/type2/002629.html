Subject: Update 82 Westy problem

     I want to thank all who gave me input into my various derivability
problems on my 82 Westy.  I took it back to the mechanic who adjusted the
new(rebuilt) AFM &amp; he agreed with Doktor Tim &amp; most of you.  It was too
lean.  He has re-adjusted &amp; the van is running pretty good.  I am not sure
of my mileage yet but I am thinking it is around 15MPG.  A little lower then
the bays but since I like the van I will probably live with it.  Thanks
again all.
