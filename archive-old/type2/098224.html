Subject: RE: [T2] pop top canvas a little small

&gt; Actually, I have.  I spoke directly to the &quot;top
&gt; banana&quot; in charge of
&gt; production.  But he adamantly insists that they are
&gt; using an exact duplicate
&gt; of the original Westfalia pattern, and have been for
&gt; 20 years, and that it
&gt; is therefore impossible for their canvas to be
&gt; smaller than the original. 

unless their duplicate has never seen the light of day
outdoors or water then by default it has shrunk.  It
is also possible that the nos canvas (at least what i
have ever seen) is a different weave and has more give
than the  canvas on the repros.  but it does seem to
be a common complaint.  did he suggest a reason why
all these folks thought the canvas was too small?  did
he think they were not installing it correctly and
suggest some solutions?
