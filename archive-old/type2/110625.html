&gt; runner to the head.  I've just been unable to get them out.  I've used heat,
&gt; penetrating oil, etc., etc. and those suckers refuse to budge.  At some
&gt; point I'll might just have to get the Vice Grips out, but only as a last

Before you destroy it, you might consider taking it to a machinist.  they
have tricks and tools that we just dream about.  Pay a few bucks now or a
lot more after it's broken.
