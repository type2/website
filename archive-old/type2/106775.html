Subject: Re: [T2] Needing a bumper

There is one in pretty good shape now being offered on that auction site
that cannot be mentioned. Bid was at $99 last I looked.

----- Original Message -----

&gt; I believe the days of 'straight' rear bumpers for '68 to '72 bays are long
&gt; gone.  That being said, maybe you can find a restorable one.  I do know
&gt; there are places that specialize in straightening bumpers.  Try Busted
Bus.
