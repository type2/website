&gt;I was driving on 101 south and it just started loosing power.
&gt;Then I saw a lot of smoke and the exhaust sounded really loud.
&gt;I pulled to the side of the road.  the engine was really hot.
&gt;I checked the oil and it was surprisingly low considering I had just filled it
this morning.
&gt;The pickup sucked. It sounds like the exhaust is really loud, but I'm not sure
if that is what is &gt;actually making the noise.
&gt;A half hour trip took me over an hour and 20 minutes.

If you blew out a spark plug, it wouldn't lose power gradually.
My vote is for a hole in a piston. Fits all the symptoms.
Might even be possible to drive an hour and a half more
like you did, but that is going to inevitably cost dearly.

&gt;And I'm supposed to meet my date again in 3 hours!

No problem. Time enougfh to let it cool and do a
compression test. When you get really good, you
will be able to calculate the available sources of
immediate assistance, tools, parts, and procedures
to drop that hot engine at the side of the road and arrive
home repaired at the first hint of power loss.
