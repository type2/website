 Hi,

&gt; 93 Eurovan (with the filler flap on the other side, so  I  always
&gt; have  to  look stupid and sit there for 2-3 minutes just short of
&gt; entering the petrol station,  bizarrely  looking  in  my  mirrors
&gt; trying  to  figure  out which side the  flap is on. (I also drive
&gt; regularly a VW Polo, a Citroen van and a  Vauxhall   combi,   and
&gt; they all have filler flaps on different sides (well, that doesn't
&gt; make sanse, but there seems to be no  logical  pattern  in  which
&gt; side  it  should  be on  (and  you  can't always stretch the hose
&gt; over to the other side (over a van/camper body (except  the  Polo
&gt; (which isn't a van (more of an estate car))))))).).
