Subject: Window openings (OR the long winded lurker)

I am kinda new to this restoration thing and I could fill volumes with the 
questions I have, but here goes...

First off, it's awful lonely here with everyone gone to Everybus... list is 
moving slow....

Second, I have no garage, so my Westy is sitting outside while I work on her. 
I want to get the body prepped for paint, but I want to do it right and pull 
the windows. Is there a way to protect the window openings if I pull them 
out? I have thought about a cover and should probably invest in one for when 
she's done, and have also thought about covering the window openings with 
poly and duct tape until it's time to take it to the paint shop (a short 
hop), then touch up the prep work when I get there. Or should I just wait and 
do it when I get to the shop?

Third, is there really a set procedure for restoration? Do I do the engine 
first, then the body, or vice versa? Or is it all up to me (or my finances)?

And finally.... Does anybody else get in trouble for working on their bus 
instead of mowing the lawn?

I have been lurking for some time and have seen (and used) much info from 
here, and have met some very nice folks (Volks?) I also have a '74 parts bus 
and if anyone needs anything that I'm not using (like the auto tranny and 
bench seats) I'm willing to part with them. I also use parentheses more than 
normal.....

TIA
May the four winds blow you safely home......
