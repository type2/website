&gt; Back in the old days when I had my 62 camper, I recall having a remote
&gt; hand-held switch. It was a black plastic cylinder with a push-button and
&gt; a two long wires with alligator clips. If memory serves, one was clipped
&gt; to the solonoid and one to the battery. Then, by pressing the button
&gt; with your thumb, you could bump the starter while working in the engine
&gt; compartment or adjusting valves under the car. Anyone know if these
&gt; still exist?
&gt; Thanks,
