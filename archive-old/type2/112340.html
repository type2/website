Subject: Re: [T2] Re:liquid repair for loose ball joints?

Not true George--

And how does an automatic trans pump fluid???

Sawdust and 90 weight took up space in the loose lower end--and filled
gaps in between the cylinder walls and pistons--

Seen it done to both the engine and trans--oil pump or not---by
unscrupulous sales technicians--:&gt;)

Saw dust was good for leaking power steering systems too--anything goes
at the used car lots of yore---

Later,

TK

That was for transmissions! Put sawdust into anything with an oil pump
and it'll sieze.
