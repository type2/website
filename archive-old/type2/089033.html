Subject: Re: [T2] What a find! I got my 0mile rebuilt engine from a junk yard.

You will have a couple of problems:
1) The FI system is D-jetronic like a Type 3.
2) The spark plugs are on a different angle and bus tin won't work. The plug
holes don't line up.

This engine has 3 studs and nuts holding the intakes down, correct? Not 4 like
a bus engine with L-jetronic.

&gt; Hello List,
&gt;
&gt; I came across a find today! I have been the market for
&gt; a good type IV engine for the last 2 or 3 months and
&gt; today I found one. I had been calling my local vw yard
&gt; for one and the guy on the other end of the line kept
&gt; saying he would find me one. Well, he said this for
&gt; weeks so today I thought I would see what he had. As
&gt; we were looking throuhg his dozen or so junk buses, we
&gt; stumbled across an engine that he had rebuilt 4 or 5
&gt; years ago. it was a 914 2L engine (case #GC000937) He
&gt; told me that he planned to put it in a Porsche that he
&gt; had in the front lot but he figured that he would
&gt; never get to working on it again. This engine had 0
&gt; miles on it after the rebuild. I pulled out the dip
&gt; stick and found only assembly lube on the very tip.
&gt; This engine came with some tin, a bosch blue coil,
&gt; header pipes, oil breather/oil cap, and a few other
&gt; small pieces. I plan to take the heads back off and
&gt; check for any rust on the cylinder walls and clean out
&gt; any contaminets. that may have entered through the
&gt; intake ports and air injection tubes. I also plan on
&gt; wire brushing the engine and various parts and give it
&gt; a good paint job. To top that, he sold it to me for a
&gt; VERY reasonable price. Needless to say, I am a happy
&gt; man today. Does any one have any info that they can
&gt; give me on this engine that I would need to know? What
&gt; year model bus engine is it compatable with? What year
&gt; Porsche engine is it? Any help would be appreciated!
&gt; Thanks!
