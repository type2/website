Subject: RE:  Key Blank Source

&gt;I've searched the library, archives and net for an NOS or repro key for 
&gt;my bus, but can't find one.  I think WWest and RMMW carry them, but not 
&gt;the L-profile.  (I sure did learn alot about keys, though...)  
&gt;One old posting mentioned someone named Gabriel in CA,

I've bought from Gabriel's before and feel very comfortable recommending him.  
If you have at least one spare key, you can send it to him and he'll cut your 
new blanks for free (I think).  And his key blanks are originals, not Taylors 
or some other.  Here's his info:

Gabriel's VW Garage &amp; Locksmith
1725 Long Barn Way
Stockton, CA 95207
(209) 475-0868

Mike g.
Colorado Springs, CO
73 Westy
58 single cab (currently stored - I MISS MY
SPLITTY!)
