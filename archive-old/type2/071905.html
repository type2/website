.....Al Brase wrote...........I think it is interesting that though this
list includes 80-83 Vanagons, not a single peep has been said in their
defense. They are actually
incredibly good type 2's, but maybe they just don't inspire affection
like loafs.

	Yes, my '82 does lack some of the loaf affection, infact when
someone hears I have a VW camper they say &quot;Oh wow, I love those old things
bla.....bla....bla....&quot; Then I feel almost apologetic when I say well it is
maybe not quite the one you are thinking of and it is a slightly different
shape but it really is very good and etc. etc.
	The fact is I am in love with my camper, and that is that. I am
sure I have more camping space than a loaf and with my Hi-Top roof, seat
swivels and my Fiamma wind out awning within five mins of arriving at a
camp site I am all set with a cold beer from my very cold fridge and a pot
of soup on the stove.
	The 2.0L engine runs a treat although the twin carbs give me
nightmares, the fuel tank leaks when full and the fuel milage is c--p.
	I always thought that my next camper would be a vintage '78 or
something but hastles with the lack of heating, frequent oil changes to
protect my hot running engine and the poor handling I would get with a
type2 would steer me towards a '90 or something.
	I do yearn to have the street cred of a type2 and I feel like an
old fuddy duddy for having (almost) turned my back on the idea.
	 		 	Sorry if I sound like a bit of a party
pooper but that't is my 2p worth.
