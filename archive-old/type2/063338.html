&gt;Well, hate to disagree with Thom but I am near 100% sure as well

hey, no prob.

&gt;it was sealing wax red and chestnut brown.  To back me up on this
&gt;if one consults the paint chip page on the KG web page you will see
&gt;the manual lists the car types each color is used with, black is
&gt;only used on T1's though L53 Sealing Wax red and L73 Chesnut Brown

I know this door is _black_, and it looks pretty original.

&gt;this page is a real treasure trove of info, but loading the pages is
&gt;terribly slow as they are understandably scanned images of the origional
&gt;manual.  Plus the benefit of the pages may be somewhat dubious as to

Scanning original manuals is one thing, but to scan the cover and post a
500k+ image on the title page?  I suggested he reduce it, never got a reply
back.  I'm willing to be he's got a T1, and between testing on his local
drive and the T1, everything looks fine to him...
