Hey everyone. I have to sell my vanagon on account of I'm moving and =
dont have room for her at my new place. It's been a great car. There are =
only 2,600 miles on a rebuilt and about 40,000 on the trans. The body is =
in good condition and so is the pop top. Over the past year I have put =
about two or three grand in her and have receipts for all. I live in San =
Diego. If your interested please e-mail me flowinkool_at_sbcglobal_dot_net . Im =
asking 1,500 obo. I really need to sell her before I move, so I am =
flexible on the price. This a sacrifice but I have to do it. Thanks for =
your time.
