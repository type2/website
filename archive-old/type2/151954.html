&gt; I've been hearing complaints that when my speedometer reads the speed
&gt; limit I'm actually driving 10 mph slower.  Examples: I read 35 &amp; am
&gt; actually going 25.  Same problem at 55/45 and 25/15.  I've not found
&gt; any mention of adjustments I can make to solve this problem.
&gt;
one thing is that it should be linear not constant.  the error would be %
not certain MPH

&gt; Could this be a wheel-size problem?  I have P205 / 70R14's for tires

well on my 78 when I had 205/70R14  (another thread but P tires are
underated for the buses weight)  I had things calibrated and it was only
off by about 3%   ie: I was reading 65mph when it was actually about 63mph

YMMV

speedo cable is broke so at the moment my bus isn't even moving when I'm
going done the road............
