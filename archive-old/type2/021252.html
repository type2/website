Re jocla's 68 bus &quot;overheating&quot;
My take on this (some may disagree)
Firstly, I'd expect a new engine will run hot until tight metal
tolerances wear in, this is why you change the oil more often.  Yes, the
engine compartment should be well sealed.  Make sure it's not too lean
or too advanced.  How do the plugs look, or the tailpipe residue?
I had a 71 bus with a pressure and temp dipstick gauge up to 1985.  210
is normal once the oil heats up (even letting it idle for 1/2 hr) and
the readings I get on the 78 is that the oil cooler valve opens
(pressure drops) around 190 degrees anyway.  You gotta run over 212 to
drive off water vapors.  At highway speeds 250 seems high, but my 71 ran
that way at hot outside temperatures.  Never failed due to overheating. 
My 78 goes thqat high if I'm doing 70 in 90 degrees plus.  Big thing is
to watch what's happening to the oil and oil pressure.  Don't do long
runs (uphill) floored, as the lower rpm's (lower oil pressure)  combined
with full throttle make for poor oil coooling.  If your air flaps are
present but not working (therm. not hooked up), it is not the end of the
world- just takes longer to reach 212 and you'll get condensation
buildup in town driving.  My 78 with unrebult engine (224K mi now) had
no thermostat hooked up until 180,000 mi!  If your flaps are missing,
you are not directing air properly to the left side and they should be
reinstalled.   MB
