Subject: Engine cooling question

I just installed Casper's engine back into the compartment after painting 
and all.
Looks real nice.

I recently put NewBus's engine back in after installing a new clutch.

They are the same 1970 year with 1600SP engines.

Now then,
NewBus is totally as it came from the factory right down to just everything 
imaginable, except for the dual battery charge system, hot start relay, and 
new radio installation.

Casper probably has a bit more time warp culture implanted into his veins.

When these engines are slid into place, there is a cooling rubber trim 
piece that fits in between the far forward engine tin and the engine 
compartment area. The engine compartment, just below the fuel tank cover, 
is grooved to accept this trim piece.

On Casper,
this rubber has an obvious time induced &quot;set&quot; to it so that the rubber 
wants to fold down,
and the engine then slides up &quot;against&quot; this rubber,
thus creating an air seal in the compartment for cooling.

On NewBus,
the normal &quot;set&quot; of this rubber piece assumes a more horizontal plane,
and the engine tin slides in &quot;under&quot; this rubber.

To my mind, NewBus sealing arrangement looks to be proper and would be a 
better sealing arrangement.

But ............
What is proper ??
Do you know for sure which is proper ???
If so, how do you know for sure ???
