Subject: Re: [T2] Replace 75 F.I. with 78 Looking for parts

&gt; Quick fact: Anyone who regularly drives their bus at 95% of WOT for
 extended periods needs to think about a different vehicle. Or adjust
 the maintenance interval and start saving up for regular cylinder head
 replacement.

Hey, how did you know that is how I drive my 77 Westy?  Even at 80 at WOT I get passed all the time on the
freeways here in Calif.  Yes, I cruise at 80 for 200 miles at a time..... then I need gas:))
