Subject: Re: [T2] looking for THIS hose - see MORE pics

    Well this is the solution I'm going for and because some of you are 
in the same boat I thought I'd share my results.

    I went to the Evco, known as the &quot;house of hose&quot; basically a store 
that has nothing but hose, lots of air compresssor stuff too.  I showed 
them my broken hose and told them it was an air hose and I needed 
something of the same length and the same interior diameter.  They 
showed me something close and for only $2.50 it was worth a shot.  This 
is what I got  http://users.sisna_dot_com/baca1/new_hose.jpg

    Despite all my effort I could not make it fit and it was close... 
very close.  So then I go thinking... 
http://users.sisna_dot_com/baca1/dremel_tool.jpg  that's right.  I used the 
cylindrical sanding bit on the dremel tool to make the interior diameter 
wider.  There's basically three levels of the hose, the inside rubber, a 
nylon web, and that blue stuff you can see.  To make it fit I only 
needed to sand away a little of the inside rubber, not even touching the 
nylon.  Of course the dremel tool isn't neccasary, a drill would suffice 
or even a round file.

    You can see that the hose even has a natural curve to it which made 
it a nice fit.  Check out the result

    The obvious disadvantages are that it isn't stock and doesn't look 
anything close but if your next step is to consider duct tape it's 
probably a step up.  Also despite modifyiing the diameter of the ends 
its still a fight to take them on and off.  I liked how my old hose 
would cooperate after  I loosened the clamps.  I'll probably be using 
this until I find a like-new replacement.
