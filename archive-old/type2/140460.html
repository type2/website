Subject: John Browns Buses

Okay, it's getting close to that time. Only 16 days left until John Browns
Buses in Harpers Ferry West Virginia. One of the best campouts in the area.

The t-shirts have been ordered from the tye dye guy and I am now taking
orders. Since we didn't have alot of time this year to coordinate things I
need to know ASAP who would like one.

The prices will be $15 for short sleeve and $20 for long sleeve. They range in
size from youth medium to adult XXL. You can pay for them at the campout. No
need to prepay! I will only have a limited number of shirts for sale at JBB
unless you send me an email with your request.

Hope everyone is looking forward to fall in the mountains.

See ya there!

Sharon
