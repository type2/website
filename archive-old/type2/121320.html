Subject: Is this a bled-down hydraulic lifter?

The rebuilt engine I got for my '76 Westy recently came with hydraulic 
lifters.  I am totally new to the whole hydraulic lifter scene, and 
have never personally heard the banging noise that hydraulic lifters 
make when they bleed down, though I have heard/read the stories about 
it.

Anyway, being so delighted that I fixed my electrical problem 
yesterday, I decided I would take the Bus on some errands today.  I 
started it up (yay, no more cold start problem), and I got back out 
while the engine was running to put my Bentley manual back underneath 
the seat.

In short, I was horrified by the noise I heard: *bang bang bang bang*.  
&quot;Eeek, do I have a loose rocker?  What the hell is that?&quot;, I think.

Being in a hurry, and not wanting to do any damage if it was a real 
problem, I punted and used our Honda for the errand-running.

I didn't think that a recently rebuilt engine's lifters would bleed 
down, so I called Buslab (who did the engine job on my Bus) and asked 
them about it.  I drive the Bus about once a week, and it has been 
sitting totally idle for a week due to the electrical problem I had.  
They said that it's totally possible for even a new lifter to bleed 
down with that type if interval between trips (my trips tend to be 
short right now, as well).

A friend and I went out to record the noise:

Nevermind the clipping of the track (the roar of a VW is a little too 
much for the microphone on a Palm Tungsten T, I guess :-), but you can 
plainly hear the noise as the engine winds down after revving.  It's 
also pretty audible at idle.  Listen for the &quot;clack clack clack&quot; type 
sound.

Is this the sort of noise that bled-down lifters make?  I guess perhaps 
I should just drive it around for a while and see if the lifter pumps 
back up and the noise goes away.  Or should I first pull off the valve 
covers and inspect the valvetrain?  Or am I just being too paranoid? 
:-)
