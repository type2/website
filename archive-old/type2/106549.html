Subject: Re: mystery wires

Thanks Matt.  I was able to confirm that those wires occupy pins that are
shown as unused in the wiring diagram, so I guess I don't need 'em.  Next
time I'll label loose wires too.

Rick





&gt;The extra two wires you are looking at, with the female spade connecters,
&gt;are probably the altitude compensation circuit.

&gt;You could hook a rheostat in there and make your bus run a bit richer. I
&gt;think it's richer. I've seen a wiring diagram for that somewhere. It was of
&gt;some interest to me when I had my bus in Colorado.
