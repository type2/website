Subject: 2nd Annual Love-Bug Off 9/28-9/29

I will be posting a virtual copy of our flyer on my personal webpage
sometime over the weekend for all the &quot;Suth`ners&quot; who've shown interest
in the little &quot;Do&quot;.

Brief update:

In the works, a local band has shown considerable interest in performing
on Saturday sometime, still working out logistics with the park powers that
be.  Also, a local micro-brewery/resturant has offered a small batch of
something beerish although again I'm just now working out logistics.  The
by-laws of the parks service may preclude public consumption, but perhaps if
bottled and given away as a commemorative?
