 if
&gt;you are going to call &quot;bad karma&quot; on someone,
&gt;you should either give no name at all or make sure
&gt;the name you give in unique. Just using a first name
&gt;might call into question the character of other
&gt;&quot;Matts&quot; with 1970 parts.
&gt;
&gt;keep on keepin' on...

&gt;-Matt

Good point! I think the Matt in question  is no longer on the List even...

Several Listees have offerred me a bumper (local ones are hard to find), so
I will offer some Type 1 main bearings -
one catch: I have several dozen sets, NO standard-standard-standard ones;
what I'll do is give away a set to the first two people whose needs match
my sets. And I have some WACKY setups... up to .100 over!
