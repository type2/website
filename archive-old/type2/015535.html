&gt;&gt; &gt;(4) Any other checks of determining wear that can be done without
&gt;&gt; &gt;further teardown??
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Is pulling the valve covers and backing off the adjustment screws to
&gt;&gt; inspect lifter wear considered &quot;further teardown&quot;???? How about removing
&gt;&gt; the breather can to see just how much tar buildup is present??? 
&gt;
&gt;I checked the valve adjustment a month ago (hydraulic) and pulled the
&gt;adjustor screws, here's a pic of how little wear at 220,000 mi. Since I
&gt;will likely replace the pushrod tube seals while it's out, is there any
&gt;determinations of lifter wear in the bore?  

I'm sure there is a spec, but it is very rare that it would wear to the
point of a problem before many other things will wear out.

SOMETIMES when left a few
&gt;days, I do have to wait about 20 min. for a lifter to pump up.

Fer sur use the correct German filter. It solves this problem instantly in
many cases. If your already using the correct filter, then you can try a
sludge removal addative to clean the varnish out of the lifters. The bottom
line is, if the noise goes away after warmup, it's not serious enough to
warrent the expense of lifter replacement. It is annoying none the less. 

&gt;   By breather can do you mean the black box on top with the large hose
&gt;going to it?  There was an oil film inside, but no signifgicant varnish
&gt;that I could see looking down into the hole under it.  

Yeah, that's the one. That's what I would expect if the lube interval has
been good. Varnish and crud build up shows there before anywhere else. It
is the coolest area on the motor. Poor keroseen through the can. If it
flows without restriction, that's a very good sign. If not, wash it out
until it does. Blow through the tube on top. You should feel no pressure
buildup at all, just like blowing through an open tube. Guess how fast you
can check this at every maintenance inspection to verify function??? 10 or
15 seconds maybe. Just pull the dip stick and blow through the breather
tube with a piece of hose kept for this purpose, in situ (as situated, in
place, don't even have to pull the sucker and risk disruption of the gasket
seal).

The gasket needs
&gt;replacing-any source for these?   

BusBoys, BusDepot, Dealer, any VW savy shop or supplier. I use
non-hardening Aviation Permatex on that one for a good seal. Most hardware
stores and FLAPS sell sheet cork of the proper thickness that you could
CAREFULLY cut a gasket from. Those internal corner require a VERY steady
hand. Use a hole punch for them then cut the straights away from them. 

So far as you know, this is an original factory assembled motor??? Never
been apart??? This is a candidate for overhaul, as opposed to rebuild, if
you don't push it too far. That means you just might be able to put in new
std/std bearings and seals in the bottom end and get another 200k. No line
boring or crank cutting. Actual measures will tell the tale. If you replace
the bearings BEFORE they hit copper, the wear on the crank can still be in
spec under life long adequet maintenance. Just one more BIG advantage for
better maintenance intervals. A very quick overhaul without sending the
block to a machinist.

Another wear condition you can check. Set an exhaust valve just off it's
seat, sleightly open. Then push back and forth on the valve stem and note
the distance with an indicator guage. Compare to spec. guide clearance. If
your out of spec you are on the way to a burnt valve. Valve stem clearance
controls heat transfer from the valve head through the oil film to the
valve guide to the head. If the gap gets too big, the valve head can't
loose it's heat and will crack and burn. This is what drops valve seats as
well. You don't drop valve seats or burn valves unless something is out of
spec.

If you save the motor now you might get another 220k. If you experiment too
long you risk loosing value on a rebuild with a cut case and crank. Know
that cutting cases and cranks does nothing but reduce life. The hardening
on the journals is very thin. If you cut it thinner for oversize bearings,
you cut the life out of it unless you send it to one of but a few factors
who could do this right for about the same cost as a new crank from the
dealer, or more. 

If you plan everything ahead of time, you could do a complete overhaul with
a long two day weekend with no machine shop costs and be std/std stock
again at easily half the cost of a better name reman.

If you wish the best advantage from good maintenance, you must take the
advantages it provides.
