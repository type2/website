Subject: Green Light On at low RPM!!

My green oil pressure light is coming on at idle and at low RPM's. Once I'm
going it's ok but when I slow down at lights  it comes back on. I just put
some more oil in so the level is fine. The old stuff looks pretty black and
(maybe I'm paranoid) but there appears to be some little metal grits in
it..... : ( I guess I will try replacing the pressure sensor. Anyone have
any ideas?
