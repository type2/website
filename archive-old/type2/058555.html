I stand corrected!  I hadn't seen any that way, but it would be
logical for VW not to have slightly different castings for beetle and
bus.  It's surprising that they didn't go ahead and drill and tap them
all, as the small saving in machining would be offset by the need to
keep the bus cases separate from the bug cases.  The cost pointer
probably swung to the side of not machining since there were a lot
more bug motors than bus motors.

I always insist upon bus cases, even on the engines I put into the
family bug.  You never know when the engine might end up in the bus!
 
&gt; You're right about the adapter, in the early days of adapting bug
engines to
&gt; the bus rear mount, there were only the four stud plate mounting
points on
&gt; the oil pump ....newer kits like the one I have in my hand
currently, have an
&gt; additional through-bolt lower mounting point as well...this helps a
lot with
&gt; the torque twist issue...kit comes with a new oil pump cover plate
as well,
&gt; less the flanges...nice item...I'd use it in a pinch without
question....

Sounds like a much better design.  Notice that the only real torque
load that the mount takes is the reaction torque to the engine revving
up or slowing down.  The reaction torque to the motion delivered to
the axle is taken care of over a long lever arm and isn't much more
than the load of the weight of the engine itself.
