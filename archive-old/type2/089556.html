Subject: question: replacing rear brake shoes

Folks - 
I'm in the process of putting new shoes and wheel cylinders on the rear
brakes of my '78  bus. I've been using Bartnik's article on replacing rear
brake shoes, which so far have been great for a novice like me. I've run
into one snag however - removing (so I can replace) the star adjusters. I've
removed the adjuster screw, but the stars are pretty frozen. Bartnik's
article mentions using a bolt longer than the adjuster screw and threading
it in until the star just &quot;pops&quot; out easily. I've tried that, but no luck.
I'm not real comfortable cranking a bolt in there tighter and tighter
thinking the star adjuster is just going to pop loose. Can anyone offer
their experiece with this? Is there another way to try and remove them? 

I sprayed liquid wrench on them last night, so maybe they'll give this
evening when I try again. 

Thanks
Mat
