Hi list..

So we are in the middle of our first teardown of a Type IV and have made
the following discoveries:

1.  The end of pistons #4 and #2 appear damaged along with the surface of
the associated heads.  Prior to removing the engine from the bus, a
compression test indicated that cylinder # 4 was low.  The engine was
running prior to the recent removal with plenty of bluish smoke billowing
out of the tailpipe.  

2.  The air intake valve on cylinder head #4 appears to be fused with the
head with some mushroomed aluminum around the valve.  

So the question is, where do we go from here?  What caused this to happen
in the first place, and can these heads and pistons be repaired or must
they be replaced.  If two of the pistons are replaced, do you recommend
that the others be replaced as well?  Thanks for helping out some newbies.
