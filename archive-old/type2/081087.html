Subject: Re: [T2] Electronic ignition opposed to points &amp; condenser


Mike,

That's not a bad idea,   I myself have been using (for 2 yrs now) electronic
ignition set of : Crane Cams Hi-6 CDI, Porter signal sender (in place of
contact breaker points) and Crane Cams PS-91 Coil, along with Beru
Silverstone spark plugs, with no disadvantage at all.  I only get bigger
fire sparks,  much more overall power....  No more point adjustment.....
with the Hi-6 you will be able to set your limit of maximum RPM easily, to
avoid overreving.....

&gt; Hey everybody,
&gt;
&gt; The dude at the parts shop I go to tried to sell me an electronic ignition
&gt; replacement module instead of putting in new points and condenser. He says
&gt; he runs one in his bus, and rarely has trouble with it. Does anybody have
&gt; any info or experience with these devices?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
