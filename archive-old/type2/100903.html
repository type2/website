&gt; 	I have a chance to pick up a non-running '79 bus in my area for a very

&gt; shape.  The FI is partially removed and there appear to be a few broken /

&gt; me to keep my current 1700cc (still running, but getting tired..) as a

sounds like a good idea

&gt; 	1) Can a 2.0L be setup to run well with dual carbs (if so, any suggestions
&gt; for carb type)? I would like to keep things as simple as possible, and
&gt; wiring FI into a bus that has never had it before does not sound like much

yes and no but I would give serious consideration to going with the FI, if
you decide to try carbs, keep ALL the FI stuff so you can swap it back in
when you decide you have had enough of the carb problems  ;8*}

&gt; 	2) Any problems matching the '79 engine to my '72 transaxle? The '79 is an
&gt; automatic, so I know it most likely won't be a drop in swap. Can I keep the
&gt; clutch/flyweel from the '72, or do I need to upgrade to the bigger '79 unit.

you will have to change the flex plate to a flywheel (Don't forget to
reset the end play) also will need to use the 72 starter the auto tranny
uses a different starter

&gt; 	3) Shift linkage - any problems with compatibility between the shift
&gt; linkages of these 2 years?

not if you don't swap the trannies,  also you will need a new accelerator
linkage because the auto tranny uses a special short accelerator cable (it
only runs to the tranny with a solid linkage to the engine)

&gt; 	4) Gearing - will the gearing in the '72 trans be a bad mismatch for the
&gt; 2.0L? I am guessing that I will have good speed off the line, but still be a
&gt; bit slow on the highway compared to a later trans?

??? but the extra low gearing may be to your advantage considering where
you live.  

&gt; 	5) Install / fit - will the '79 engine bolt right up to the '72 mounts (I
&gt; think it will..) or will I have to do some fabrication for new engine mounts
&gt; etc.
don't think so.  the rear mount may need some new holes in the frame as I
think the engine/tranny is longer than the 72 but not sure others I'm sure
will jump in on this

oh don't bother trying to save the half shafts for your bus, the auto
tranny half shafts are different length, although the CV joints are the
same.  

of course you could always rebuild the 79?!?!?
