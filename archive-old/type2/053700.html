&gt; FYI: To rent a car carrier from U-Haul, oh how I loathe their name, coast to 
&gt; coast right now  it costs 800 bucks and a tow dolly is 400 bucks.  They are 
&gt; the only company who will rent one without their own trucks that I could 

shell out the $800 bucks and bite the bullet it will be worth it.  one
trick to save money is to find someone coming back and bring the car
carrier back (or you return one from the west coast) it is about half the
price

only way I would haul a bus over the rockies
