Hello,

* Charles Baxter Miller *
Thanks for the tip on the speedo, regarding checking for movement at the cap 
prior to lubing.  Even though I was not the originator of the question, I 
have that problem with two of my vehicles.  That's the cool thing about the 
listserve - everyone benefits.

If I find the cable is secure at the cap, isolating the issue to lube needs, 
what kind of lube would you suggest?

My gut tells me to try a tethlon spray - petroleum products seem to attract 
dust in situations like this.

Also, at what end of the cable?  Both?  How much?  I seem to have a habit of 
overdoing it - the &quot;if a little is good, than more is better&quot; syndrome.

Thanks again,
