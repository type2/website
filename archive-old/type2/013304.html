What are your opinions on balancing a bread-and-butter 1600?  I wanted
to do that when I had mine built, but the VWFLAPS talked me out of it,
telling me it was overkill on a stock engine.  I can't help but think
it would help *some*.

Also, I was re-reading Bruce Anderson's 911 Performance Handbook, and
there is a description of a process called &quot;boattailing&quot; the case, basically
&quot;porting&quot; the area of the case under the pistons, to improve airflow.
This is supposed to buy you up to 10hp on an early engine.  Anyone do
this on VW's?  How about piston squirters?

&gt; total of 14 grams! Less then some stock OG cranks I have had balanced. They
&gt; will balance to within 2 grams, if I get anal they will take it to 0 but
&gt; then the price goes up.
