I think you need a flying bridge, ala Further:

*I* think that would be way cooler than plexiglass, and, if you did it 
right
and made a platform whose weight rested on the gutters instead of the 
roof,
you could even make a locking trap-door and have some semblance of rain
protection.

Hope you live in a warm climate either way.
