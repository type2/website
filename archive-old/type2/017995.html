Subject: Rear Bearing &amp; Grease
Message-ID: &lt;373AEC4E.1C292FC_at_harmon.bml_dot_usouthal_dot_edu&gt;

    I've got a weird problem with my '73 westy. I replaced the inner and
outer rear bearings over a year ago -- around 3000 miles or so -- and
the grease on one side persists in leaking out along the stub axle/hub
splines and spraying out off the end. The bearing starting making noise
about 1500 miles ago, so I pulled the hub and greased it, it looked
rather dry. Started making noise again more recently, so I pulled the
hub this morning before I came to work -- it wasn't dry, but the not
heavily greased either. And the hub was fairly loose. So I greased the
outer one (with a grease needle) and snugged up the hub nut. By the time
I drove 30 miles to work, there was a lot of grease sprayed all over the
wheel. 
    It isn't the rubber grease seal, which was new last year, and the
grease isn't coming out that way anyway, it comes out the splines.
Looking in Bentley, I don't see any other seal for the splines, so what
gives? Is it just too much wear in the axle/hub spline fit? Is there a
fix?
