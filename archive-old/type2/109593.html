Subject: Starting This Year's First Unending Heater Thread

Volks,

I have finally acquiesced to the urge to heat my 78 Westy -
really heat it.  Finding a BA6 is, apparently, next to
impossible, so I've spent all bloody day researching various
other options, including researching the libraries, archives and
the Net as a whole.

I'm piqued by the idea of a Propex, but can't seem to find a
distributor.  Anyone have leads on new or used?
I've also given consideration to the Mr Buddy (or whatever its
real name is), and I'm keeping that idea in the back of my mind.
I don't think I'd be satisfied with a Blackcat-type arrangement -
I want something a bit beefier and more permanent - something I
can tee into my propane fitment.

In exchange for information (or perhaps by means of an apology to
the list for starting this thread), here's a gift:
http://www.bluebird-type2.co_dot_uk/how%20to%20propex.htm  (It should
be archived in the library under HEAT!)

Also, if anyone's particularly interested, I have a useless-to-me
BN2 heater F/S.  Please contact me offlist.

Cheers,

Justin L. Smith
