&gt;OK, I also tried to view the images hosted on tripod and geocities and, as
&gt;usual with these services, I got the &quot;Bandwidth exceeded&quot; brush off. I
&gt;wasn't under the impression that this list is massively huge, so how
&gt;low is the pathetic bandwidth limit set at? :-(
&gt;
&gt;I guess the question is, Why in the world does anyone that actually wants
&gt;others to see their pictures, host them on tripod/geocities anymore!?
&gt;
&gt;It seems all you get for free is the opportunity to waste your time hosting
&gt;your images on their service just so they can not let anyone else see it.
&gt;LOL
&gt;
&gt;Well its your time to waste, personally I'm swearing off ever trying to
&gt;follow a picture link to tripod/geocities again... ;-)
