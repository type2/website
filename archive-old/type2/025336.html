&gt; I've been reading the postings about generator charging lights coming on and
&gt; it reminds me that I've had a similar problem with mine. I have a 1600dp  in
&gt; a 79 with alternator. At night you can see that the alt light has a steady
&gt; glow. Nothing affects the level of intensity of this glow. Not engine speed
&gt; or a change in load, eg. lights on/off etc. Output from the alt is normal at
&gt; a steady 14.4 volts. It's been like this since I bought the bus over a year
&gt; ago. I had another vehicle with the same problem that I ran for years
&gt; without any detrimental effects. I read a fix for this problem some while
&gt; ago in a magazine but can't remember what it was, rectifier, diodes or
&gt; something, but I'm sure it wasn't brushes.

This sounds like excessive resistance in the wire leading to the lamp--if
alternator output is normal, it's not that. Wires pick up resistance with
age, and your Bus is now old enough to buy itself beer. You could always
change the wire, but that's a major PITA; living with it is also an option.
