Subject: The Perfect Body (Metal)

&quot;The Perfect Body&quot;:
The VW rumor mill in the pacific northwest has been running again. I have a 
'65 kombi with some pretty nasty body damage on the drivers side, behind the 
front door. looks like somebody hit the bus with a forklift at about 10 mph. 
Anyway, a local (yokel?) said &quot;just heat that up red hot and splash some 
water on it, the metal will shrink back to its old size&quot;
Uh, this sounds like something i'd rather not do without a little burn kit 
on hand. Anyway, has anyone else ever done this? Is it (ill) advised?
-Jeremy
