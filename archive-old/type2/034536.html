Subject: oil problems

[Please include the sender in your reply, he is probably not on the list. --KH]

Hello, I have this crazy problem with my 1835 cc typr1 engine, since I have
owned it it will leak oil out of the oil pump area, even when I just turn it
over oil starts leaking out, I have rebuilt to solve the problem but to no
avail, I have tried 3 different oil pumps, currently i hve a oil filter
connected pump, and it still leaks. Any ideas would help
