Subject: Stiff brakes question

I am looking into purchasing a '71 Westy from someone
here in town, and we are working together to wrinkle
out some of the problems so that my purchase would be 
more solid. Anyway...

The brake fluid reservoir has been leaky for the past
year now..temporary solution...fill it up every couple 
weeks...but recently after having steped on the brakes
the pedal was extreemly slow to rebound...then once it
reached top...it was very stiff..way more than usual.

Is their a possible fix for this? My thoughts would 
be air in the lines...but that would create soft brakes...
right.

Any thoughts and comment welcome and appreciated.

PS: This bus has been in the south most it's life,
 but having spent _1_ winter in Milwaukee, WI..it's 
 developed some cancer..the left sill (rocker?) strip 
 is almost gone...but otherwise minor surface rust...
 nothing too major...should I look the other way for $2k?
