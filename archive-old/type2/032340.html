&gt; 
&gt; So, I might be able to pick up a '72 Bus real cheap.  It's only got
&gt; 60,000 miles on the engine.  The PO blew some fuses and decided to
&gt; replase them with nails, well a fire was the ultimate result.  Burned up
&gt; a lot of the wiring. The engine turns over using the key, but there is
&gt; no spark at the coil. 
&gt; 	It's definately fixable, but what I need to know is how can I wire this
&gt; thing up so I can get it started and warmed up to yeild some reliable
&gt; compression test results?  I'll be using the 1700cc in my '74 Westy
&gt; provided the compression is ok.

--&gt; Hmm...I'd suggest jumpering a wire from the battery to the hot side of
the coil, to give it juice.  You'll have to pull the wire back off to shut
off the engine, of course.  Careful, though, if some of the other wiring
is shorted, your jumper wire may get hot in a hurry.  I don't have a '72,
but I'm guessing the following items need power for it it start and run: 
coil, idle cut-off solonoid (one on each carb), electric choke (one on
each carb).  If need be, you can just jumper power to those, with whatever
works, removing the damaged stock wiring.  If you have a test light or
meter, use it to monitor the oil pressure sender, so you don't seize the
poor engine if it turns out to have a pressure problem.  (oil pressure
sender is grounded to light the oil lamp...either connect a test light
between it and 12V, or connect a meter set on the ohms scale between it
and ground.)
