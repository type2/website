Subject: Re: [T2] cool air intake

Mike,

My opinion same as other folks, but with an added point...these things 
cost *big* bucks...I buy a lot of car parts at Lowe's....in the plastic 
pipe department&lt;grin&gt;.

The other part is actually attaching them to the carbs....your are sure 
going to get a &quot;lot&quot; of vibration 2 feet away to something attached to the 
edge of the engine....Kadrons take a 2 5/8&quot; neck size.

Use the stock air cleaners and spend your money on something else.

Cheers, dave

&gt; At some point this week I will be installing a set of dual Kadrons.
&gt; 
&gt; and was thinking it would be a good idea  to use something like this:
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.performance-air-filters_dot_com/cold-air.html
&gt; 
&gt; and have the intake snake up above the battery tray's and sit just inside
&gt; the air scoops thus getting FRESH unheated air...
&gt; Thoughts..
&gt; 
&gt; Suggestions.
