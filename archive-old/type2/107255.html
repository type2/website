Subject: Metalic/dusty taste after driving w/ heater on

	Folks,
	A cooling system failure in our Corrado left me commuting in our
'70 single cab for the last month. I've noticed lately that I have a
bitter, metalic taste in my mouth after I reach my destination,
45 minutes to an hour of heater-on driving. I've put 2000 miles
on it in the last month.

	I think repetition has sensitized me, I don't remember this
taste from when I started taking the truck every day, a month ago.
Its been an occasional driver for the 7 year's I've owned it,
up to now.

	Is this just tough luck? I can imagine taking the complete
heater/defroster system appart and blowing it out with compressed
air at the gas station. After which I suppose I could pass
a line and then pull a swab through at least the flexable metal
tubes (beetle style) that I put on to connect from the heater
valve boxes to the Y tube. Then there's the Y and the single tube
that runs up to the front from the engine.

	Sure, I can *imagine* lots of things :)

	DOING it might be something else. :))

	Anyone else have this experience? Have I got an exhaust leak
and that's giving me the bad taste? Is my bus trying to kill me?
Or am I just picking up dust and exhaust fumes from less-than-
spotless interior? Its been YEARS since the interior had a full
wash-down. I get a similar bad taste after handling things 
from my Public Storage storage room- a combination of dust,
and whatever wierd chemicals they no-doubt spray outside.

	Bill
