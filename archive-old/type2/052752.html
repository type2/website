Subject: [T2] carberator problems, maybe?

First off I want to say thanks to the list because I have already solved a
lot of problems by just being on the list and listening.

Well Friday night I loaded up my 1971 camper and headed out of town. About
10 miles out the bus started to lose power and then jerk back and forth
whenever I gave it gas.  I did notice that this happened only when I start
to get close to around 2500 rpm -3000 rpm.  I could shift, and the bus would
drive but when it needed power it would feel like there was nothing there
and then it would jerk back and forth.  I am not a mechanic but my first
thought was the carberator. I thought that maybe the mixture wasn't good
enough to get any power.  Using my trusty Muir manual I took the carburator
out and low and behold it is really clean.  So here is were I need the lists
help:  Am I even on the right track?  I also thought about taking my
carburator into someone to look at.  
Thanks in advance for the help.  - Rawls Moore
