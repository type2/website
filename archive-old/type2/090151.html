&gt; One of the things I need to know is if there is a way to repair rusted
&gt; fuel outlets and returns on the gas tank.  They are rusted down to

&gt; a section that is removable but I couldnt tell.  I have a feeling it
&gt; is not replaceable.

If your fuel outlet and return stubs have rusted off, they are not easily
replaceable.  I am sorry to say I have seen many FI tanks with this
problem and I have a bad feeling about it getting worse as time goes on.

The stubs are welded to the tank, no nut on the bottom like on the '68-71
tanks. It is possible, but difficult, to find somone who will weld on a
gas tank.  Usually it is cheaper to buy a junkyard replacement.

&gt; ordered the Bentley for the bus but i was curious in the meantime.
&gt; Also I was wondering if anyone knew of a good place to get a full set
&gt; of replacement fuel lines for this engine (metal and rubber lines).

You can buy and use metal brake line as a replacement for the netal in the
straight sections.  The fule ring is a junkyard item, tho you might check
wiut VW.  I bought an NOS Fuel ring there not too long ago.  the hose is
available from any VW supplier.

&gt; I need to replace some exhaust parts too.  I have seen these
&gt; aftermarket mufflers that supposedly &quot;replace six pieces with one&quot;
&gt; they eliminate the crossover tube and elbows and such.  Has anyone
&gt; used one of these mufflers?

Yes.  The quality is so widely variant that it is tough to say anything.
My general rule is that the &quot;Monza&quot; style rusts faster than the &quot;stock
look&quot; but I have seen solid old Monza style and have seen the stock look
rust out very quickly. One important point on the 76-78 exhausts is that
all four corners of the heater boxes are supposed to have support bars
that bolt them to the engine case.  I rarely find them in place and they
are important!
