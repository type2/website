&gt; I'm &quot;stuck&quot; in Maui right now

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Must be a nightmare... I feel for you... :-) :-) :-)
&gt;

Yeah, we're all shedding tears... ;-)

I was just telling Chris I don't get to see ocean until mid Oct when I get
to go on a road trip to Cali. =) To smell the salt air again... Sigh.

I forgot to mention, Chris, I do have some web skills. (heh.. just a few)
Let me know if I can help with your site in any way.

Mini-Update on Greg: Last I heard, they were going to look at an 82 Vanagon
that had been converted to a 1.6 Diesel running veggie. Seller's asking
price was $3500. Troy's going to pick up the difference in what Greg can
afford and Troy and I will rebuild that original 1600. Road trip next spring
for the Wicals to NC I suspect. Solely to take the 69 back to
Greg.Ofcourse. ;-)

This should be fun! I need some fun right now after this past week. To top
it off, my daughter's in the hospital (nothing horrible, they're doing a
sleep study to track down an issue she has at night).

I just got home and am hating these 12+ hour days. At least I got to go have
dinner with my wife and daughter before they headed to the hospital.

GWB is getting worse. Backfiring like it's trying to take down the Tommys.
