the little button next to the 120V outlet is a circuit breaker.
Unfortunately the button on mine has long since broken off making
resetting a little difficult.  My question is: Can I simply install a GFI
outlet instead, and just exclude the breaker altogether?  If not, does
anyone know of a source for a replacement breaker?

No, a GFI is not a circuit breaker.  A circuit breaker  limits current,
while a GFI shuts the current off if the current in both sides of the
circuit is unequal.  There are combined devices, but be sure that you get
the right one.
