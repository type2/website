Subject: [T2] New Creed

This is to be my new creed:

 A split window bus Bentley manual - $80
   The Idiots Guide VW manual - $30
   Being able to search through thousands of messages (written on buses
by your friends and put up in a searchable index and hosted out of the
kindness of fellow Vdubbers hearts) at 2:00 in the morning while sitting

at the computer in your underwear drinking coffee - Priceless

Thank you  Isaiah
