Subject: Re: [T2] 78 Westy 2.0L engine weak fire

Hi Gail,

I checked the temp head sensor and it test ok. I also checked the
condensor and the coil and they seem ok also. Engine starts up ok and
then as it warms up the idle slows down and eventually dies. After it
warms up it idles ok and runs good on the road. Any thoughts as to what
may be causing this. All answers appreciated. Thanks
