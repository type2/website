Subject: Re: [T2] 8.5 volts at FI fuel pump - what's up??

Well, Bob, I am home, in Springfield VA, having been towed 89.6 miles/  I
was stuck on Sunday afternoon, while coming from EZ Pickins .  I tried
calling you but I must have an old number.  Dolan was home, and he walked me
through a bunch of diagnostics.

The wire from the defroster switch to the fuel pump didn't seem to work.
Maybe I was suppose to turn the engine over or something.

But I think I found the source of the problem.  Long story cut short is:
the little double ground wire at the double relay came loose and undone!!
The one that fits between the double relay and the resistor pack.  Hope,
hope, hope . . .

I hope that's it.  It would account for the instant loss of power, and even
some of the hesitations I was experiencing a bit earlier.  We will see.
