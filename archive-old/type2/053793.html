Jeff, I would go and bleed the brakes, even if there working ok.
My brakes were not acting up but I went ahead and flushed them,
found lots of crud in there so it was good to flush the lines. ;)
I am sure its been said to you before but check those fuel lines.
You well be happy you did!

brake fluid is cheap and so are good fuel lines so dont
skip doing it

have fun!
Alex,
