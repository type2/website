&gt; I used a straight piece of pipe (nipple) that raises the sender up over the distributor. To be honest with you, I am a little scared of this arrangement, as it's too easy to knock the nipple and I'm afraid someday I may damage the threads in the case...or oval out that hole by accidentally bumping the nipple. I've heard that VDO sells a flexible extension and I think I'm going to go to that; it will require grounding the sender separately, but I think it will be well worth the trouble to keep me from messing up the case.


thats' one reason I used the 90 degree pipe since it stayed well below the
distributor, infact it is bloody hard to get the wires on it with the FI
system manifolds in place.  never have hit it.
