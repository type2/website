Although this price is largely correct, fi PPG's (Ditzler's, best paint
IMHO) catalyzed primer runs easy $100 per gallon for the system,
basecoat and clear about the same, I object to the gun price, a
basic Sharpe HVLP is under $250 from most suppliers, Harbor Freight
sells questionable quality HVLP systems for half that, $450 or so
will get you a turbine HVLP from any number of people, the true
killer is the darn positive pressure mask setup, cheapest I have
seen about $350, but firefighters surplus stuff may be less, running
of a teflon ringed compressor or scuba tank.

Also one of the most modern and durable PPG clears is now safe
in that it contains no isocynates and can be sprayed with just
a filter mask, still things have come a long long way from a good
laquer job in the back yard.
