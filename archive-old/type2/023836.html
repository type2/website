Gentlepersons-
                       You guys out there got all the luck...Anybody know of 
a Van-related re-
cycler (even a junkyard'll do), in the Northern NJ area? Anything close 
enough to pop o-
ver to without turning into a road trip? Two of the local yards in my area 
were EPA'd
out of existence - not that they had any VW's to begin with but at least I 
got my M-B
alloys cheap before they disappeared.
