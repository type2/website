Subject: Re: [T2] Reattaching oil pickup in a 1600cc engine

&gt; Hello Guys   It can be done but you will have to bend the pickup plate some 
&gt; to be able to get in there , run the stud in then attach the nut to a box end 
&gt; wrench using dum-dum or 3 m wheatherstip glue after tightening re bend the 
&gt; plate back in to shape.I would also use locktite and a lock washer here.  Not the 
&gt; prettiest way but way better than tearing the motor down.   later and have fun 

is this only for a 1600 engine or will it work also on a 2liter engine
