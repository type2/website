That's the worst part of the sickness, and it comes on early then never 
goes away. We loose all credibility.

The problem has to do with the buses themselves. Other people buy 
vehicles like old Karmann Ghias and assume that it's going to be a few 
years to restore before driving (their estimates are low, too, but 
what's a few more years).

Not us. We buy buses that mostly run and we try to keep them mostly 
running. We always think we can do the bearings and the brakes and 
still go camping this weekend.
