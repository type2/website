Subject: Re: [T2] Take a look at the new T-5 Camper.

&gt; Thanh and I looked into of those Rialtos at an RV place while we were in
&gt; Rochester a couple summers ago...very, very nice. If I recall the shower
&gt; slides out of the wall.  Too much luxury for me...
&gt;
&gt; Who'd service it? The VW dealer would probably have a heart attack if you
&gt; pulled in in one of those...

Yep - my parents have a 99 EV Winnebago camper, and they have been bounced
back and forth from VW to Winnebago to independent RV service centers for
camping equipment issues. Definitely a lot of passing the buck there...
but it sure is nice when everything is working perfectly (and you're not
paying for it either)
