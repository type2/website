Subject: Erratic Idle

My 76 isn't idling like she should be.  She has a 2L FI (GD code) engine.
I've checked the dwell (48) and the timing is right on the money at 7.5 BTDC
and doesn't fluctuate at all.  I checked all of the valves and they are at
.006.  I also checked my compression and I have 1-123 2-122 3-121 4-123.
The spark plugs look fine.  With the dwell meter hooked up and the engine
warm the idle fluctuates from 780 to 950.  Turning the idle adjustment screw
will raise the numbers, but the fluctuation is the same.  I've looked
through my Bentley and there are multiple causes, but I thought that I would
ask the list to narrow it down before I begin testing everything on my
engine.

Thanks so much,

Ted Kitch
