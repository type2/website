Hi Volks!

I have a sign which I made myself from old recycled bumperstickers on cardboard.It sits on my dashboard and reads:
&quot;Pray for Downhill&quot;
That says it all for a VW, we have to take things slow.Driving them makes us more calm and allows us to enjoy things more than those driving newer faster cars.If you can't take it then get a new bug or something.Then again I don't like new bugs with their quiet front engines,heat and  preppy owners who think they're reliving their youth or something.They make me so mad.But that's another story and not bus content, so I'll stop complaining about it.Peace and stay in tuned w/what everyone on the list refers to as the &quot;busma&quot;

P.S. Sorry to any of you who own new bugs,I just love the classics and was only joking.
