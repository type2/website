Subject: testing a distributor

A while back, there was a fellow by the name of Will Wood who posted
regularly on one of the acvw lists. He had a distributor testing machine of
some sort and offered to test list members' dizzys.

Can someone describe what such a machine would be like and what tests it is
capable of?  Is anyone aware of a service where we could send one and have
it tested?

The  defective nature of several  distributors which I have received by
mail order over the past several years is what prompts me to ask.

Jack
