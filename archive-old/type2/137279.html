Subject: aircool 83 FI schema for DUMMY wanted

Hi there,

Just got my engine/transmission back, beautiful  !!!. When I look to my 
garage, there are mess everywhere, I am wondering if my van will ever 
see the sun again !! ;-)
Anyway, I notice that my FI  have some bad (almost broken) wires. I want 
to test them.
Is anyone draw a comprehensible schema of the FI ? comprehensible means 
could be read by a non mechanic/eletronicien.
the one which come with my manual is like ... Chinese to me !!!
that's a 83 aircool California  vanagon 2000cc

thanks

Chris
