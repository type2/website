Subject: Hmm...the traffic!

Well, since the list has split i notice that i have gotten MORE messages 
on just the t2 list than i did on the best days on the v_at_l....

odd..

and i havent even added the vgon list yet!

oh, and towhomitmayconcern:  my poor 75 is now officially retired.

its a storage bus, sad to say.

unless someone can donate an engine.
 and even then, i would be suspect, cause the poor thing is cursed.

the ONLY vw i've owned that just wouldnt make it home. TWICE.

the bugs, everytime &lt;except the time when it was 10 below, and i had no 
visible oil, it was 12.30am, and i drove anyway...i guess sleeping in the 
drivers seat frozen served me right..&gt; they limped home at least. they 
made it, even if just barely. but not the bus.

it died on the side of the road, again, and after i stoped to help a 
Thing of all times!!
he'd run outta gas, and he waved me on as i passed, but, having been 
passed along many times my self, i turned around and made sure he was ok. 
he had his cellphone, and his mechanic was on the way w/ more gas...then 
2 miles farther, it went shkapoot.

with an off duty cop right behind me o aid in pushing off the road!

then an onduty lemme use his phone...

i grabbed my tools, hoped in my friends truck when he got there, and 
left. didnt have time to tow it home that night, and the next morning, i 
ended up w/ a freeride to Lollapalloza..which, btw, sucked pretty hard.

the next night we towed it home, w/ only an hour to spare before it was 
impounded. &lt;hey, i woulda lost my 200$ carb!! :)


the horrors.
