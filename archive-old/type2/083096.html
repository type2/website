Subject: early vanagon transaxle/EB2k+2


Hey everyone.

The plan is still for me to make it to everybus again this year....Likely
wont be able to get out of work early, so I'll be in VERY late.

Anyway.

Anyone have a reasonable condition aircooled vanagon tranny they want to
drag to EB with them? (John, you coming? still got that old box? yeah,
the NOS POS blew again. this time full of oil. cursed, i tell you..)


And if anyone has a lead on an Asuan (sp?) Brown early vanagon sliding
door in great shape...I'm interested, depending on the location.  Someone
hit moms 'goner in the parking lot and left it that way.  Big ugly on the
door, fortuntely only a minor scrape on the B pillar..)

babble.
