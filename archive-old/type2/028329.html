&gt; Biggest drawback with BA6 or BN4 for that matter, is that you
&gt; can't get ANY new parts, so if you put one in, start hording spare
components.


Not completely true. We do sell the glow plug and triple relay for the BA6
(the two parts that most commonly fail), although they are a bit steep at
$49.95 and $59.95 respectively (minus listmember discount).  A handful of
other BA4/6 parts are also available.  (We don't carry anything for the BN4,
though.)
