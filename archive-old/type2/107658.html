Subject: Re: [T2] Full flow filter on 1600

&gt;You have to run special filters, since the oil pressure to the filter can
&gt;reach 300 psi on a cold morning start, leading to a blowout all over your
&gt;driveway.  The Fram HP1 filter is the one to use. I am building a 1776
&gt;engine with full flow as we speak. Tom

Some filters are available with a bypass built in to allow for this.
I use the same MANN filter in a full flow system on my beetle (1600 DP) that I
use in my type 4 bus. Never had any problems with them.
