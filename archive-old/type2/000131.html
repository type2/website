Volks,

  Ive got my lower bolts started into the tranny and I assume the spine is 
headed in the hole on the clutch. I did not have clutch alignment tool but 
worked with it 4 an hour and it looked dead center, I m satisfied its ok. I 
cant get it to budge another fraction, I tried pushing clutch but i assuume 
Im not far enough in yet it goes to the floor. I read you may need to turn 
the engine cause spline is not lined up and I assume that can be doen by 
putting in gear and turn one wheel a hair and it should turn the spline 
reciever, given the other wheel is locked.....?????????

  ANy Tips????????????
