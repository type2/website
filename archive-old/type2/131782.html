Subject: RE: [T2] BK commercial

&gt;From: Kafertoys_at_aol_dot_com

&gt;  My kids pointed out a new BK commercial, there is an early bay westy and 
&gt;the
&gt;police, go figure.


Yep seen that one plenty. IT is a commercial about the use of Whopper 
wrappers to get free music downloads. It is a few kids rocking out and the 
officer walks up and questions them about their music being free. &quot;Yeah it 
was free is that illegal?&quot; they answer. It is play on the Bus driver 
stereotype &quot;always up to no good or something illegal&quot;. Most would think of 
illegal drug associated issues but it goes farther back than that, ever 
heard Alice's Restaurant? John Baker has. Dumping trash out of a bus is 
illegal too =D.

Of course I like that one better than the fully medicated model playing in 
the wind, dancing around on what looks to be a nice bus(although PINK) in a 
tampon commercial. Total disregaurd for the roof of the bus.
