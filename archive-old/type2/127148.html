I think that you would be much happier with the original stock T4 engine. There was a reason the newer, larger buses went to that.
 
You can get a decent rebuilt T4 for $1500 or less (I got one delivered to my house for $1100 in 2002). Install yourself (another $200 in misc parts) or have a shop do it. $6K is ridiculous.
 
There a couple of high-end rebuilders out there who make excellent T4 engines, and charge several  grand for them. Nice if you can afford it, they will likely last longer and give you less trouble, but it all depends on your budget.
 
I'd suspect that the costs associated with converting to a t1 would equal the cost of an installed stock t4.
