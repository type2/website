Subject: RE: Westy water tank leak 
Date: Thu, 17 Aug 2000 13:52:13 US/Mountain

&gt;I have a crack at the bottom of my water tank, in the threaded area 
&gt;where the pump motor screws in. Is there a type of glue that can be 
&gt;used to seal this crack effectively?. 

I've had good luck fixing various plastic tanks with a soldering gun.  Just 
heat up the gun and carefully draw a &quot;bead&quot; where the crack is.  If you need 
more plastic to work with, melt and &quot;pull&quot; it from the edges around the crack.
