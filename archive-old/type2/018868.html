I had the same type of problem (and actually now have a similar but
different one), the prob that resembled what you described was caused by
the demise of my air flow meter (afm).  This problem was most noticeable
at cruising speeds like 60 mph.  I thought the same thing, that it was
not getting fuel, it would seem like it was stalling out, in short
little bursts.  It was the AFM, it was getting fuel all right but not
the right mixture of air and spark.  Good luck
