One of our engineering wonks needs to look at this:  air is significantly
denser as it cools.  Ask any pilot and they'll tell you that aircraft work a
whole lot better in the cold air.  Go for a swim and you'll find out how
much harder it is to move through dense fluid than thin.  Is it possible our
boxes on wheels are affected?  I'd bet so.  I'll sic my brother the nuclear
engineer on it and report back.
