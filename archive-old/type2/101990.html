Subject: just read it please

ok. this is kinda long. but just read it anyways please. So  I have a 72 bus 
with the stock type4 engine. I had never had any problems running on the 
freeway at 65+. The engine was completely strong. I never noticed problems 
with it overheating (I did the dipstick check whenever i was out driving for 
extended times (of course i never really drove for that long at a time, 
maybe 30min max)) It had maybe 100 miles on it since the last tuneup, 
probably not even 100. So then i let my step dad drive it to his work (he 
was having car problems) and he used it 2 or 3 times to go to and from work 
(about 20-25 minutes, mostly on the freeway). Then the day after i got it 
back from him I noticed a knocking back there and it wouldnt start. I then 
went and set and checked the timing, and set and checked the points gap, and 
she started up fine. Except that there was a little smoke coming from the 
driver side of the engine, Also i noticed that the knocking was gone! so i 
turned the car off, and i havent touched it since (about a week, i have 
friends to drive me around so transportation isnt a real big issue). then 
today i went out and tried to start her up. she turned over and almost 
started (i think that i could have gotten her to go if i had given her some 
more gas and kept trying) but i looked over my left shoulder (driver side!!) 
and smoke was covering that side of the car! i went, opened the engine 
compartment, lots of smoke (not black, white) andi thought that i would come 
inside and ask some of you people. Im not mechanic and ive only gotten about 
as far as being able to do my own tuneups so i hope that someone can give me 
a clue. I was thinking a burnt valve (#3 exaust)?? well thanks for reading 
the entire post and i know its long but i just felt i needed to explain the 
situation in full.

joey
