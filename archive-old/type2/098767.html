&quot;Perhaps this could be part of a new tradition. &quot;

John/all,
I don't wanna toot my horn...and I could be wrong
here, but I felt that i kind of started this a couple
of years ago.
Someone offered up something, I claimed it and then
offered up a flourescent westy light from a 75 on the
condition that the claimaint offer a gift of similar
value to the list with the same condition attached.

There's definitely a chance that the tradition was
around before I did it.

Any of you pre-1998 guys remmeber anything like this
from those days?

Wishing I had something I could offer up this year,
Clark Gordon
