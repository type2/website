&gt; and how!  took putting the cover back on to convince me the engine was not
&gt; blowing up!

Don't it tho!  When we were first testing the engine in the '80, we ran it
up to 55 on the highway... dared not go any faster because I was *sure*
the engine was going to blow up!!! I was deathly afraid that my '80
aircooled had accidentally gotten a diesel trans in it!

Hi,

You should hear it without the engine tin, when I first did the V8
conversion in the Bus I had a mate up the back while we road tested it with
no engine cover on and no engine tin (obviously since it's water cooled now)
He had to contend with extreme noise, gale force hot air and it wasn't
running too well on the 4 barrell holley and back fired through the carb,
never heard so many expletives spew outta a guy before.  I'm just glad I was
driving and he was &quot;in&quot; the engine bay.  At least when you hear 'em like
this your Kombi seems like a cone of silence when you put the engine cover
back on.

Now for the question, is it a big job to change the bushing that the
steering arm pin goes through on the front torsion bar housing.  Would I be
better off pulling the beam or trying to do it with the beam in??? (Hope
this makes sense) I've had a look and pulling the beam looks like a pain as
I have copper piping for the radiator passing between the torsion bar
housings but if the bushing needs to be pressed out/in them I guess I'll
have to pull the beam.

Cheers
Steve
