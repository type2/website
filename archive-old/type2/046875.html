Thomas, if you have spark coming out of the coil when you do the coil test,
the problem's not the coil. The problem is that the power's getting into the
distributor but not out...which means either (1) the rotor's not turning
(meaning the distributor has risen a little bit--taking off the distributor
cap and turning the engine over will eliminate this, if it's not the
problem; (2) the distributor cap's bad--a FLAPS can test this; (3) the
rotor's bad (FLAPS again); (4) the points have gone away; or (5) the
condensor's shot.

Look at the points. The little nylon rider on a set I had in once snapped at
the rivet holding it on; no rider means no points action means no starting.
Check that too.
