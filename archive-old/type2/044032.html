Subject: [T2] oil coolers: german($$$) or brazil

Hey all,

Just wanted to know if there were any opinions about German doghouse oil
coolers vs. Brazilian.  Are the German ones really worth the 190.00 that
Berg sells them for?  I can't imagine they cool any better so is it 
that they will last longer or less prone to rupture?  

Secondly I wanted to thank every one for their patience while I complete
this rebuild.  I realize I've asked some lame questions and I appre-
ciate everybody's time in answering them.
