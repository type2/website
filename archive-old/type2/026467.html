Subject: RE:  Pressure washing?

&gt;I am wondering if anyone would care to offer their opinions on
&gt;pressure washing the underside of my 2.0L FI engine?    Is this 
&gt;not such a good idea to remove grease, oil, and road dirt?  If not 
&gt;done right, can I take off my undercoating?  

I say go for it.  There's nothing underneath the bus that isn't exposed to
70 mph rain and debree anyway.  If you're planning on spraying INSIDE the
engine compartment, that's another story.  You mention undercoating on your
engine?  There isn't any.  If yours looks like it has undercoating on it
then its VERY dirty and needs to be cleaned off.  

Only recommendation I'd make is to use Simple Green concentrate instead of
Gunk (or other engine degreasers).  Gunk is toxic and is illegal to use in
car washes.  If the owner catches you using it, he's gonna be pissed off (of
course, he may not be to wild about you spraying off any quantity of grease
anyway so you might want to consider doing this late at night or real early
in the morning).

Just my opinion.
