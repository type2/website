Subject: roof rack refinish

Hey, thanks to all the listees who posted info re: roof rack
refinishing.  After a couple of phone calls I found a local shop that
will re-plate my roof rack for $50.00 Canadian.  He says that the
process leaves a very smooth finish that is thinner than galvanizing but
just as tough.  He also says that there is no need to remove any of the
rust that is currently on it as the acid bath will remove all of the
rust.  He also says that there is no problem with screws and bolts and
that dipping the whole thing in one piece doesn't make the screws or
bolts and harder to take off after plating.  Yip pee
