Subject: PLFVW - Give it a rest

Folks,

There have been some comments regarding actual events and statements about
what's going on in Dawn's life.  I don't know about the rest of you, but I
have known a few times when my life was not going well, but my life was not
laid out before literally hundreds of people.  Some of you feel betrayed,
okay.  You gave Dawn some money for a product you have not received.  I
don't know how many of us could stand the scrutiny and criticism that has
been thrown toward PLFVW.

Give her some time.  The changes she is going through are major; some of you
may not have any idea what her life is like.  And those that do should
empathize.  Give it it a rest and kill the comments; or, in list speak,
please, kill the thread.

Take a look around and count the things you have to be grateful for - it's
an appropriate time of the year for it.  There are a number of you that have
mutliple VW's.  Families that care and love you.  Children who smile and
laugh with you.  Think about those things.

Take care and Happy Holidays
Phil

&gt;that I ordered curtains for my '71 camper van, from PLFVW, on Sept 9th of
&gt;this year.  As of this date I have not received my curtains nor my
&gt;requested refund of $172.


I can't believe all this complaining I am hearing!!  You're acting like
$172 your life's savings!!  This isn't big business here, we are working
with VW people who are generally a bit slower (speed wise that is) than the
rest.

Remember in the western movies the old angry man with a stick beating his
lame horse tring to make it move faster, this is what this situation
reminds me of.  Dawn is having some personal problems at the time, but bad
mouthing her is not going to help.  In time, I hope PLF gets back on track
and continues to put out the type of product it always has.

I always enjoyed VW people because of their kindness and caring nature,
these people whinning and complaining are not true VW people in my book and
we would all be better off if they were not on this list.

Money is not the root of all evel, the LOVE of money is!  Being a teacher,
I have never enjoyed a large income, but what I make suits me fine.

Dawn, if I can help in any way, count me in!!  And when you get back on
your feet, you can be sure I will be ordering some more of your high
quality products.
