&gt;I've done it on 914's a couple of times and know you can replace just the
&gt;electrical portion without jacking around with the part the key goes into
&gt;(no new key needed).  I assume it's the same on a 73 bus, but if anybody
&gt;could point me in the right direction for a step-by-step method for doing
&gt;the deed I'd really appreciate it!

Mike,
         I did this recently.  Yes it is pretty easy although the 
replacement switch I got from BustedBus (new) didn't quite match the 
original.  I think I had to replace the connector on one of the wires - no 
big deal.  Anyway, just remove the four machine screws from underneath the 
steering column cover and pull the steering column away from the 
dash.  Look at the casing that contains the switch (follow the wires) and 
you will notice a very small hole.  Use a jewelry screwdriver (flatblade) 
to loosen the small machine screw and you can maneuver the switch 
out.  That's it!
