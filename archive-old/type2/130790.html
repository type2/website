Subject: EveryBus Carabus Question - Fuel Prices

Hi Volks,

We're doing a bit of fine-tuning here before EveryBus, and I was 
wondering about the price of gas on the route. Up here it has dropped 
slightly during the past week or so, into the mid-60's per litre.

If people could p-mail some local prices in Western NY (i90), western 
PA (i79/i-77) WV (i77) and NC I would appreciate it.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
