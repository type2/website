Subject: Re: Qu on Detecting misfiring plugs

FWIW

Long time ago when I was in auto trade school we built engines and ran them on the floor. Talk about fun !!! Tuned engines and did all kinds of stuff.

I lost count how many times I had to remove a NEW Champion plug because they were no good out of the box.

Never bought them since as a rule.

All the other brands have been ok and I prefer Autolite, Nippon or Bosche.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Quoth Rick Taylor
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Always use Bosch plugs, Champions have an extra thread at the bottom and will carbon up, then when you take the plug out, the carbon in the thread can ruin the threads in the head.&lt;&lt;
&gt; &gt; Arent NGK's pretty good too?
