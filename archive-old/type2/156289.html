Subject: RE: [T2] tires

We didn't have any now that stuck this year.  But that's  unusual.  What tire pressure do you recommend I run?  I don't  run my bus heavily loaded.  Thanks...KR

&gt; the  front.  But those Bridgestones are nice tires also.  I
&gt; think  they're a bit more expensive new.  They are steel

&gt; the front.   I'm anxious to see how they all wear.


Years ago, before I discovered the Hankooks, I favored the Bridgestones
(RD603) on my Busses and Vanagons.  They handled well and wore well. My only
criticism was that they were lousy in snow (despite being rated all-season).
When I switched to the Hankooks I found them to be comparable to the
Bridgestones in all areas, but better in snow (although still not as good as
a dedicated snow tire, of course) and much cheaper.  But if you found a good
deal on Bridgestones, or needed tires on-the-spot and couldn't find Hankooks
locally, the Bridgestones are a very good choice (if you don't live in a
region that gets snow).
