Subject: RE: [T2] ADMIN: Kill This Thread: [T2] Bus fight in court

Sorry about the flare up. I was just looking for some of that Worldwide VW 
Karma that I look to the list for. Mostly I am looking for technical, 
mechanical, and/or refference in order to get this baby on the road. Plus I 
love to help whenever I can. So this is my formal appology. I think the 
energy generated by VW Bus driver's across the list helped my spirit as I 
took a beating for the bus, as many others have in their own ways for their 
own buses.

Thankfully apologetic,

Michael Knight
'77 Westy Deluxe, &quot;el Verde&quot;





&gt;From: Tom Tarka While I appreciate the continued obligatory bus content, 
&gt;this thread isn't terribly bus related.

&gt;Let's keep it on topic...
