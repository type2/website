Subject: New AVP engine &amp; pushrod tube

I finally got a chance this past weekend to unwrap and look at my new
2.0L from AVP, and it sure looks pretty.  I simultaneously look forward
to and dread the day in the next week or two when I drop out my old one
and put in the new.  Never done it before.

Okay, but before I do that, one thing concerns me:  there's a dent in
one of the push rod tubes (#3 exhaust).  There's a picture at:

I haven't talked to AVP about it yet since they were closed, but I want
some second opinions.  Could this be a problem?  Certainly if the dent
happened in shipping, there's a possibility that even greater damage
took place.  But the dent is in an fairly well protected place, and the
engine was securely wrapped.  Anyway, any thoughts on the matter are
welcome.
