Subject: RE: [RE Heating a VW bus

[...]

The Force 10 heaters have an excellent reputation and are often installed on 
offshore cruisers and sailboats.  I haven't seen a catalog for several years, 
but my recollection is that they also made models that burned diesel, 
kerosene, wood, and charcoal.

----------
&gt;&gt; In the archives, I noticed that someone had planned to install a Force 10 
boat cabin heater in a bus. These are $299 (about 1/2 the price of a 
Carver). They burn propane, and have a safety cutoff that kicks in if 
oxygen level &quot;drops too low.&quot; (I wonder how low is too low.) West Marine 
claims that the furnace is &quot;Built for use on the move,&quot; and is 
&quot;unaffected by motion.&quot; &lt;&lt;
