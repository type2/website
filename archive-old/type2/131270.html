Subject: Re: [T2] removing rusty shock sleeve from mounting bolt

http://www.aircooled_dot_net/gnrlsite/resource/articles/mods.htm

&quot; If you are trying to install your new front shocks onto the lower shock
mount and the shock doesn't fit, the steel sleeve from your old shock is
seized on the mount and must be removed. A grinder, heat, and penetrating
oil. &quot;

Hope that helps.

Don

&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; That's funny, I was just reading through the technical articles at
&gt; aircooled_dot_net and saw a mention of this exact problem. The author spoke of
&gt; heat and a grinder to get it off...
&gt; &lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt; Don,
&gt;
&gt; can you post the link to the article?
