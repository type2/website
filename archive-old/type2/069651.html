Hi,
  My '76 VW/Porsche 914 2.0 is starting to burn too much oil so its rebuild tim
e I'm sure (I'll do the leakdown &amp; compression before I spend a dime). Any firs
t hand experience with part costs?  I'll have all the machining done by a rel-
ative who is a pro-engine machinist/rebuilder, but I will build the engine my-
self to keep the cost down.  What do a set of stock OEM pistons and cylinders
cost for this Type IV engine?  Can I use Vanagon parts?  What would a set of
&quot;big bore&quot; 103mm units cost?
thanks
