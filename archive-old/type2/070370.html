I still can't believe what I passed on some years ago.
A yard sale had a small propane furnace (vented) that would fit 
inside the small cabinet aft of the fridge for just $35. Boo Hoo Hoo
Just didn't have the money or a job.  Wish I knew what it was tho ! ! !

&gt; I've one of these puppies on order and just got the visa bill (gulp!) $570.00
&gt; Ouch!  Oh well, on those cold nights (or days) I'm sure I'll appreciate it.
