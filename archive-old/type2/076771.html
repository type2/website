Subject: Re: [T2] GEX

I don't know much about Boston Bob, but I know a
Raby-built engine is one of the best things you can do
for yourself. I've spent hours at his shop, seen the
environment in which he builds the engines, and have
seen the quality of the parts he uses and the work he
puts into these motors. I've also driven a bunch of
the different configurations he uses, and he's
recommended some things to do to my own rebuilds to
make them better. 

A GEX engine is a waste of money. Jake's motors will
cost you more in the short-run, but if you consider
that they last a lot longer and perform a lot better,
that's money well-spent, and a savings in the long
haul.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I've been reading some of the things posted on
&gt; the list about GEX.  All
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; them have been bad comments.  I was looking at
&gt; there website b/c I need
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; new engine for my bus. After what I heard I
&gt; don't think I will buy from
&gt; them
&gt; &gt; &gt; but could someone tell where I could get a good
&gt; 2 liter from for my 72
&gt; bus.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; first you need a core or old motor... check junk
&gt; yards etc, sometimes
&gt; &gt; folks here have blown engines that are basically
&gt; decent they let go cheap.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; now that you have a core.  check your wallet.  how
&gt; much work are you
&gt; &gt; willing or able to do yourself....
&gt; &gt; figure a two liter rebuild from a decent core will
&gt; run you at least
&gt; &gt; $1200-1500 base and go up as you do other jobs or
&gt; farm out some of the
&gt; &gt; work.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; to give you an idea, about year and a half ago I
&gt; rebuilt mine.  cleaned
&gt; &gt; case. balanced crank. new cam, new pistons and
&gt; cyl.  all new bearings etc.
&gt; &gt; had the heads cleaned and new seats and valve
&gt; guides installed. lot of
&gt; &gt; little things that added up.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; paid to have the bottom end done by a good
&gt; machinist with VW
&gt; &gt; experience. did the top end myself..._dot_came up just
&gt; short of $2,500
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I hope to get at least 100k miles on this engine
&gt; before major work needs
&gt; &gt; to be done again...
