Subject: Converting a hard top to a pop top

hi all,

I have a 70 camper bus w/ a really nice interior &amp; body.  First question: 
someone told me it is a Rivera conversion -- did Rivera make a non pop top 
conversion?  Second question: Is it difficult to add a Westie-style pop top 
to a hard top bus?  Where can one find a westie top if this is possible?

thanks,

mike
