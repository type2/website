&gt;Hi, 
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Can you say, &quot;Periodic Maintenance Inspection.&quot; ...
&gt;&gt; ...If you had kept notes on when those parts were last 
&gt;&gt; replaced/inspected...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Err, this is a bit unfair, if I may say so. He'd only just bought
&gt;the bus and was driving it home from the seller!!!
&gt;

That was information not provided. Had it been, this is the responce.

DM says inspect the vehicle before you buy it.
It takes 2 minutes to look at the belt and pop off the cap.

I am the one who must maintain my community reputation for GETTING RESULTS.
I will always endeavor to improve, not compromise, what I know by
experience works. First premise at my shop: My clients will never be
found at the side of the road waiting for a tow truck to another shop
because the results were lacking at mine.
