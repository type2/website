&gt; &gt; I bought a set of mexican heads ...They have the long reach
&gt; &gt; spark plug hole which takes a type4 plug (W8CC instead of W8AC).
&gt; 
&gt; The archives are down so forgive me if this has been asked before. 
&gt; Does anyone
&gt; know the part # for this head?  I think mine are Mexican replacement
&gt; heads and
&gt; this may explain why my engine won't start.  I ordered the stock
&gt; (W8AC) plugs not
&gt; knowing the difference.

I doubt that it would stop the engine from starting, but it's easy
enough to check.  Get a piece of wire about a foot long, bend the last
1/8 inch about 90 degrees.  Take out the plug and use this wire as a
feeler to see how deep the threads are.  The difference between the two
depths is significant.  I really like the idea of going to 3/4 inch
reach plugs, as this has always been a weak area in type 1 heads.
