Subject: Which SVDA Distributor????

Hello friends, I was wonder what you all thought about this....   Im looking
at getting an SVDA but there are a few to choose from....   The one from
Aircooled_dot_net I heard was supposed to be good as they tune the vacuum can for
your engine type....   BusDepot_dot_com has the Bosch German SVDA for the same
price...  Ive also seen one at partsamerica_dot_com for 48 dollars!!!!   The first
two mentioned are both 129 dollars....
Has anyone had any experiences with any of these?????
Any input is appreciated...

I have a 78 type 2 camper with a 2 litre and stock FI...

Thank you in advance

Aaron
