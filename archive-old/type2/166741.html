Subject: ZDDP and SM rated oil

On the ratwell_dot_com page about which motor oil to use, Mr. Atwell says to use
SL rated oil if you can find it, because of the higher ZDDP allowed. I did
some research on the API website and found this long document, which in
appendix F (page 61, printed on page) says oil weights higher than 10W-30 do
not have the limitation on how much ZDDP is allowed, though a minimum of .06%
is specified (phosphorus, not ZDDP is actually what is limited):
http://www.api_dot_org/certifications/engineoil/pubs/upload/1509_16thedition04200
7.pdf

Also, footnote &quot;d&quot; on that page says this is a non-critical
specification, which is confusing. Does that mean oil with more or less ZDDP
allowed, or what?

Anyway, does this mean I don't need to worry about using
SM-rated castrol GTX in 10W-40 or 20W-50 weights? I think so, but who knows...
