Subject: '78 2.0L Vacuum Lines

Hi all,

Someone (forgive me, can't remember who) mentioned a diagram of vacuum lines 
for their engine.  Can someone point me to a similar schematic of vacuum lines 
for a '78 2.0L?

Your help, as always, is appreciated.

And thanks to all that have responded to my suspension and rebuild questions.
