&gt;Honestly Richard, I believe you are over thinking this.

That's because I'm trying to understand how it works. Up to this point &quot;everyone&quot; has said it's the best and then has had no more to say about it. Getting the details is like pulling teeth.

&gt;I have about 20k miles with zero maintenance or adjustment to the
&gt;ignition system to say that this product works well.

I have the same reliability from my Pertronix.
