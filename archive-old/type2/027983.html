Okay,

I think I found the problem that's keeping my bus from starting...but it's not fixed yet (never heard that from *me* before, have you?)

A while back, I replaced the plug to the cold start valve and I think I mixed up some wires. The times it started for me would have been times that I caused one of the wires on the improperly-wired cold start valve to come loose. See?

Anyway, now I've got to figure out which terminal on the cold start valve connects to which terminal on the thermo time switch...or does it matter?

More generally, when you're hooking up terminals to fuel injector plugs, does the side of the injector that each terminal connects to make a difference? I would think not, since it's like a switch that's either on or off. Right?

BTW, the running joke in my house is me running in swearing that I've found the problem with the bus...my wife looks at me lovingly and says &quot;Great, honey!&quot; The kids roll their eyes. Sometimes Kristy asks me how much it's gonna cost. I may not be too bright, but I'm persistent. :)

Thanks! Joe
