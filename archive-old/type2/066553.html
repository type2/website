Subject: Re: front wheel carrier 75 Westy -Reply

&gt;The wheel is mounted to the body on my bus.  I bought the mount and
&gt;cover from Rocky Mountain Motor Works for $35.  It was easy to install.
&gt;There have been threads on better ways to mount the tire.  It works fine
&gt;for me, but I have not had a flat yet.  I think there is an insert that can be
&gt;put in the hole so you don't tear your bus' nose off when you remove the
&gt;tire from the mount.  Think Ron Salmon said something about that?
&gt;
&gt;Good Luck

My Neunsitzer came with the tire mounted up front, and the VW insignia
thoughtfully dangling from the rearview mirror... The tire carrier was
attached to the front of the bus using sheet metal screws which went into
the ORIGINAL holes that previously embraced the insignia mounting posts
(deep breath). Never had a problem with tearouts, but I finallly removed it
just in case, and put the tire under the front seat where it belongs -
where it is a pain in the BUTT to remove and takes up all my storage space
