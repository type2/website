&gt; A great second choice, though, is to have a camper that you can use for a
&gt; weekend or a week, driving and camping from A to B, then park (at an RV
&gt; storage place) at B and fly, train, or take the Greyhound home. Next
&gt; chance you get, go retrieve your bus and drive from B to C. And so on.
&gt; Less wear on the bus, and time is less of a factor.
