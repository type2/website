My family and I are leaving Sunday morning for a whitewater kayaking trip to
central Colorado.  My wife, 16 month old daughter, and I just returned from
a 1,900 round trip to the Florida panhandle with no problems.  I will take
the AIRS list for Kansas and Colorado in case we have problems.  If you see
us on the road we will be driving Kermit our 1976 sage green Westy deluxe
and pulling bikes and kayaks on a small blue trailer.  Wave and we'll wave
back.  Trip report coming soon.  Take care.

Randall and Kermit (The lean, green, mean machine)
