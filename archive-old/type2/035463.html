Subject: Re: emissions testing

The news from California is positive about getting our $300 out-of-state 
vehicle penalty fee refunded! The governor is backing the legislation 
necessary to pay for the refund, and one committee in the legislature passed 
thru the bill last week, unanimously. So don't despair. File for a refund, 
if you haven't done so before.
As for emissions testing here, the business is decentralized so that local 
service stations are the backbone of the system, via a formal authorization 
and on-line computer link to the state. The system is efficient with little 
hassle in the procedure; the &quot;standards&quot; are sometimes obscure, depending on 
the make and year of vehicle.
The charges for a test run between $20 and $40, plus $8.25 for the paperwork 
(now computerwork) for the certificate of compliance. There is competition 
in price for the service, and most shops are helpful in letting you tweak 
the adjustments if necessary.
All in all not such a hassle, as you describe in New Jersey.
