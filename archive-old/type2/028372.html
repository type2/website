Darren et al, This guage chat happens at intervals, it always ends up with
the idea that it is best to consider guages that mortals can afford as
providing a useful datum to watch for change from. I have VDO, they seem
fine, nice and consistent, if they shift radically I will seek out why. They
look nice and make for security from informed driving. Use them and relax.

&gt; Ok..if the general consensus is that the VDO gauges are
&gt; inaccurate, then are
&gt; there any better solutions (without investing a small fortune) or are they
&gt; just par for the course?
