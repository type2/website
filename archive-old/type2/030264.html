&gt; As far as economics go. I calculated that a daily driven (15000mi+/yr)
&gt; bus will require approx the same outlay for points/cond as the cost of a
&gt; points repl unit over 18 months. Of course thepertonix has gone up a bit
&gt; since I last checked.

I forgot.
Assuming that you are repl points/cond at 3000 mi tune up intervals.
Of course you might say that the points can last a lot longer than that
but I would counter that the oil will too but you still change it.
