Subject: Re: [T2] Timing revisited

Kevin,
I'd really question the accuracy of the job done by the mechanic at
the shop before jumping on the delay in a timing light. Next I'd check
that the springs in the dizzy are lubed well, work well and bring the
advance mechanism like they should. 4 degrees is not that much
distance on a worn advance mechanism.

I've always wondered how the people who work in shops know how to time
the thousands of cars they &quot;tune-up&quot;. Is there a universal resource
for them to look at ? If not they may &quot;go by ear&quot; and that could be
the reason for the 4 degrees timing difference. Does the shop you go
to has a printout of this :
http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/ignition.htm

BTW : to the physics master on the list, if you feel like posting an
estimate of time delay from the instant the plug cable carries the
high voltage to the instant the _cheap_ strobe light goes on, I'd be
delighted to read. In particular I wonder how to compute the induction
delay in the pick up magnet. I'm sure the fact that the timing light
is cheap will make a tremendous difference.

&gt; They've both been timed by
&gt; local shops recently and when I got home and checked the timing they both
&gt; are timed at 10degrees BTDC.  Why the difference between their strobe
timing
&gt; efforts and my static timing efforts?
&gt;
  Shop manager says &quot;probably just a difference
