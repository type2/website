Subject: hole in the header - road trip alert

fellow vw enthusiasts,
i have this hole in the header.
it is definitely a manufacturer's defect...
i'm going to melt some frickin' metal into it...
instead of getting any results out of Pozzi's vw.
besides, they didn't make the thing.... they just sold it.
time, distance... not worth it for something i can fix.

anyway.
i've got a friend who is purchasing a westy and taking a 
road trip over to the west coast from nevada, and going north over and 
back down...
was hoping to get him on the list... but he's got webtv.
and that's someone's joke, isn't it?

anyway, i was hoping for some hot tips on helpful locals and part/wrenchin'
shops along the way... just in case.
he's only got a week or two to prepare, so who knows what'll go 
haywire. i'm going to give his bus a once over when he gets here...
he's planning on staying a week or so...
however... i'm not certain of his route, and if he had some really good 
places to pass near... it might define in his mind as well...
because at this point... it's looking like he's got it planned sort of 
seat of the pants.

thanks in advance.
