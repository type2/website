Subject: Clutch Rumbles

This is on a '72 westy with a 2 liter

about 75% of the time when I am stopped and have the clutch pushed in,
after a few seconds, it begins to rumble. starts quiet and gets louder
and then quite then stops and repeats the sequence -

History- Put in new clutch plate a couple months ago.  Didn't really
need it but the engine was out.

Adjusted the clutch about a month ago - it was too tight most no free
play.

About a week ago I noticed the rumbling.

Not much to go on, but if anyone has any idea please share I'm baffled.
Thanks
