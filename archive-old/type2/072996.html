I have just read Charles Baxter Millers ABSOLUTE request that his name not
be placed on the BPRS (name subject to change) list.  Well Charles B. your
name will NOT be there unless you want it to be, and it is quite clear you
do not.  Didn't you take Frank Burns place on M.A.S.H.?  Just kidding
Charles.  : )

Relax people, this initiative will not invade your space, pocketbook, parts
cache, or privacy unless you are willing to share it.  Let those who are
without care, care for their own world.  Let those of us who do care care
for ours and theirs simply because it is the spirit we live our lives by.

I am patiently sitting here reading the issues and answers each post brings
into the mix and so far can at least see a website listing the names and
maybe just phone numbers and e mails of those volksfolks willing to assist
others in a time of traveling crisis.

I don't like the idea of a money fund either, and yes I do agree that if
you leave the house unprepared for mishap then you cannot expect someone
else to cover your expenses.  When I was on the road I operated stupidly at
times on a wing and a prayer, but have since learned I can relax more with
at least enough money to buy me a used engine if that should be the case.
Plus that much money automatically ensures I can eat more often.

Folks I brought this idea up as a way to help folks that participate on
this list be more comfortable with taking a trip in their bus.  I did not
bring it up to confuse the situation, or encumber others, or invade
privacy.

I have recieved over thirty e mail expressing outstanding interest in
becoming a part of whatever we work out.  If nothing else we will simply do
a website that would ONLY include some resource info such as spare parts
list, how to aquire an easy to access e mail account, a list of good
mechanics recomended by list members, e mail addresses, and a phone number
(optional).  Plus how to use the locl library to send e mail etc.

The parts warehouse is right now questionable but a parts available list
other members are warehousing might not be.  Think of it in terms of
success and not defeat.  Geez, its not like I am gonna show up at your door
saying &quot;Hey there, can I eat dinner with ya'll.&quot;  No wait, that might not
be the best example.  I might just do that sometime.  You get the picture
though.

And yes Ken Hooper is right, I do eat a lot but I was born large.  Besides
he is a skinny little pissant that needs some fatty example shown in his
life.  : )  The only reason he said it anyway is because he knows I think
enough of him that I won't kick his scrawny butt.  : )

Relax everyone, and I will post up what I see verdict tomorrow afternoon.
We will then proceed to either action or in-action.

Charles Juanzet Ford (and my name will be on the list)
