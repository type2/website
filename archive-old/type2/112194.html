Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Where do you keep your fire extinguisher?

( and I'm sure we all keep a fire 
&gt; &gt;extinguisher in our bus, don't we? :)
 
I have two both in the front for easy access..

better safe than sorry..

the cheapys last for a couple years before they loose
their charge. Next time a will buy two expensive,
built to last, and to polish, and even perhaps have
chromed !!
