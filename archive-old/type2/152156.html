&gt; &gt;After searching the archives, I cannot find a
&gt; &gt;length for the battery cable and ground cable.
&gt; &gt;Anyone know the right lengths.  Any certain brand
&gt; &gt;or kinds of cables that I should get?
&gt;
&gt; The positive cable is AWG 4 and 48&quot; long. Most of the replacement cables are AWG 6.
&gt;
&gt; The battery ground strap length is about 9&quot;.

I replaced all of the cables with boat cables from WestMarine used
soldered on sweat terminals etc etc, 2AWG what a difference. but not cheap
