Subject: Re:hotsoaked fuel injectors

Richard,
    Maybe you could keep the injectors from getting heat soaked by
keeping fuel running trough the fuel rails.  I guess you'd need a
thermostatic switch that would cause 2 things to happen when the
ignition switch is in the off position
    1.  Open an alternate route for the fuel to by-pass the regulator
and go back to the tank.
    2.  Run the fuel pump.

With little or no preassure in the fuel rails quite a bit of fuel
should flow through them and hopefully carry heat away from the
injectors
