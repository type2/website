Subject: Westy Painting ?'s

Howdy,

Well I got the side covers off thanks to some great advice from the list.
I'm almost ready to paint any day now.
I've got all the windows out and the top rack and pop top off.

2 quick questions.

Should I paint it with the engine lid on?
The hindges seems to cover a little bit of the cover.

And what to do about all the little holes that all the screws go into on the 
roof.
What I mean is I'm afraid the paint might fill them in and I'll have trouble 
finding them again.
Any ideas?
Or should I not worry about it?

Thanks
Kevin
