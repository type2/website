Subject: Do Two Buses Make It an &quot;Event&quot;?

Hey Folks,
     Well my attempt at getting &quot;Buses Near The Bay&quot; going again didn't draw
a big crowd. Only Mike Benthin showed up! Well, that's OK, I enjoyed talking
to Mike, and to be honest, even though the weather was nice and my daughter
and I really enjoyed the boat trip over to Smith island, the mosquitoes were
HORRIBLE! Folks at the campground office told me they stopped spraying for
mosquitoes since the season was &quot;winding down&quot;, even though the campground
was full. Hmmm, makes sense. Also, my '77 Westy ran beautifully the whole
way down and back, so good in fact, if I didn't have to go to work tomorrow
I'd have just kept driving!    Jeff
