Subject: Re: [T2] Torque converter rebuild

Argrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!! I thew an old torque converter
away about a month ago. I didn' realize that they were
rebuildable or NLA. I knew I was going to kick myself
over doing that. Dogh!

Any who, Keep ahold of your old ones!

Luckily, I have one good one.

Have a great day!

&gt; I have had a couple rebuilt by a local company but
&gt; until now they have
&gt; been unwilling to advertise doing it. (Type 2
&gt; converters)  The current
&gt; manager now says I can advertise this so
