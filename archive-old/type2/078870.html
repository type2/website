Subject: Re: [T2] boiled linseed oil or raw linseed oil for rust treating
 rocker panels?

Courtney,

I doubt it matters much, I would use the boiled for the faster drying
time.  I do have a warning, tho, that ought to be in 64 point type on
every can of linseed oil, boiled or not....

NO LINSEED OIL NOR ANY THING THAT HAS BEEN IN CONTACT WITH LINSEED OIL
SHOULD BE BROUGHT WITHIN 10 FEET OF ANY MANMADE STRUCTURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This especially includes but is not limited to:
rags,
clothing,
brushes,
rollers,
etc.

No doubt this sounds paranoid, and it is, but I have heard sad tales from
way too many sources and have become a bit paranoid on this subject.
Linseed oil generates heat as it dries! All sorts of fires have been
caused by flammables contaminated with drying oil bursting into flame,
often inside buildings.  I used to use it by times in woodworking and it
surprised me a couple of times.  Thing I had never thought were in contact
turned out to be, and got hot/scorched as a result.  Please wear tossable
clothes to do this and change and toss the clothes in a *metal* trash can
afterwards.  And keep the trash can well away from your house!!!!
