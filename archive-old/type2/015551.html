&gt;I'm not going to disagree with Karl or T.P Stephens or Bentley.  I'm not 
&gt;trying to say anyone is right or wrong.  I'm only relating my experience at 
&gt;face value, and here it is:

Indeed, careful and correct procedure with anti-seize is a good idea. My
experience with anti-seize problems is from the 'if some is good, more is
better, and too much is just enough' crowd. I pull 50 or more sets of plugs
in a year. Once or twice per year I must charge extra time to chase threads
to no avail and inform the owner of the BIGDANGEDBUCKS for a repair that
won't pull out again anytoosoon. This is common as well when a plug has not
been seated properly and oil gets pushed up through the threads and it's in
there too long. The threads become packed with hard carbon. 

Just a coupla weeks ago I pulled an air cooled plug, and the insert came
out with it. It had been installed with anti-seize and the pinned insert
gave before the thread lock on the plug. Tried cleaning and resetting the
insert without teardown. It didn't hold when trying to install a new plug.
Head has to come off. Problem was bad procedures, lack of skill and
understanding on the part of people wanting to save money by doing it their
self or taking it to Blood Guts and Gears cause they only charge half as
much. Some of us learn from such early doings and try not to repeat the
mistakes. David and many others give us the benefit of their lessons
learned from experience and all such experience is of value.   

In every application anti-seize is called for, a light film is all that is
required. But it's primary use is for steel sliding fixtures, splines and
throwout bearing forks and such. Very very different than high temp fine
threads of dissimilar metals. On the heavy steel to steel threads of the
oxy sensor the small quantity supplied on every Bosch item is most
appropriate and correct.  

No matter what you use, not more than 20k before removing the plugs to
insure the threads are serviced is insurance of high value, even if they
advertise &quot;100,000 MILE TUNE-UP'S&quot;. You will likely only get 20k from the
later high energy ignition systems before efficientcy is lost. 10k is max
inspection interval in my mind for air cooled VW's with stock points
ignition. It's not that the motor won't start and run anymore, but the
energy loss from wear of the electrodes will equate to lost combustion
efficientcy, increasing cost per mile and increasing load, ergo, increasing
wear, on the less efficient engine. Not the way to improve cost per mile.
