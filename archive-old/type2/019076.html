&gt; A few things I can think of:
&gt; 1.  Was the oil pump inlet hole plugged to work with the Berg pump
&gt; cover?

The Inlet?  The pump outlet was plugged, but not the inlet.

&gt; 2.  Have you verified that the oil pump gear is engaging your camshaft
&gt;
&gt; gear?  Certain camshaft gear and oil pump combos will not work.

check. I initially installed it with a flat, not dished cam.  I had to
tear it down to put in the new cam.

&gt; 3.  Did you use the proper gasket between the oil pump cover and oil
&gt; pump?  There are a few in the kit, but the correct one is almost the
&gt; thickness of onion skin paper.  A too thick gasket will give you low
&gt; oil
&gt; pressure.

I ordered the one from Berg, supposedly the thinnest VW made.

I think I'm not getting the pump primed, as someone suggested earlier.
I packed the pump with vasoline and I'm now gonna fill the passages with
oil using the bug sprayer thing.

thanks
Shawn
