&gt; this may have made it to the list already, but the exhaust ports are a
&gt; different shape
&gt; for a 77 (oval vs. sqaure)  than the years mentioned above.
&gt; 
&gt; They aren't going to fit unless you want to change out the heads,too. Of
&gt; course, since I know
&gt; where a perfect set of 74 heater boxes are, I've been thinking about
&gt; getting &quot;new&quot; heads for my
&gt; 77. It's almost cheaper than heater boxes for the thing :P

The ports are oval from 72-78. The square ports were from 79-83 (and
beyond, for all I know). 72 boxes will fit on a 78's heads no problem.
