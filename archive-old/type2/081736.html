Subject: Help with purchase    was:Re: [T2] AridZona Bus Sale

I have been looking for a 1973 Westy for some time now and received this
information from Jerry &amp; Melissa of T2. I could use some help from someone
in the Mesa AZ area. I called on this Westy and talked to John who is
selling the Westy for a traveling friend. John is not familiar with VW's and
could not tell me much. My problem is I am seriously interested but I live
in Sacramento CA. One alternative is to send John a check, jump on Southwest
and fly to Phoenix, rent a car and drive to Mesa, pickup the Westy and drive
it back to Sacramento. You can see the holes in this plan already. If
someone in that area would check out the Westy and let me know the condition
I would indebted to them. I have the street address if you want to contact
me. TIA.
