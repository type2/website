&lt;confusion&gt;

So, I was asking about heat riser gaskets. bus Depot carries two kinds,
one with a small hole, one with a large hole. I wrote a couple days ago,
and I've gotten a couple of conflicting responses, now I'm confused. 

I have a 1600dp with a single 34pict3 carb, 009 dizzy.

Now, I know that a plugged heat riser can cause trouble. Mine are,
happily, not plugged. But I was a little concerned about putting in the
wrong gasket, didn't want to mess up a good thing, I've already damaged
enough with my mucking about. 

I've gotten a couple of replies suggesting that I should go with the two
large hole gaskets, that's what was on there. One of them, a name I
recognize from many, many posts here, said he didn't knwo what it was for,
but he'd been told never to use the small hole gasket. 

Then, I got a message from someone, who sounded like he knew what he was
talking about, who said that I should use the small hole gasket on one
side, and the large hole gasket on the other side. I wrote back to the
other list member, who said that it may be true for some engines, but that
it was death for a 1600 dp. 

So, does anyone have any more information on this topic?
