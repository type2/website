&gt;is it hard to pull the engine??
&gt;Who's got experience?

Pulling the engine is trivial, it is laughably easy if you've ever had to
pull a watercooled.

Since you are a new Muir disciple I will merely note that he proposes this
elaborate device built of chains &amp; boards &amp; clamps &amp; kryptonite to hold up
the transmission--just put a $10 bottle jack under the trans and be done
with it. If it's a roadside rebuild and you're short of jacks you can even
let it drop it on the CVs if you have to, just be gentle about it. =^ )

I highly recommend Hoover and Wilson in addition to your Muir.

In the case of cable clamps (heater boxes and throttle) keep the clamp from
flexing with vise-grips or something while you loosen it. If you don't, the
cable takes the stress and it is liable to snap off at the ferrule,
especially in the case of heater cables.

While you are doing the heater cable clamps you will get rust in your eye.
Then you will remember that you should have worn safety glasses. Every
single one of us does the same damn thing. Every few months somebody has to
go to the hospital over it.

Pulling a retrofitted 71 engine out of a splitty is so exasperating,
because of that front left bolt, that it takes me 90 minutes instead of 45.
=^ )

80% of rebuild time is spent cleaning stuff. (85%? 90%?)
