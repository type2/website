Subject: need help - vent windows

Hello everyone,

I've been reading almost all e-mails that have been sent in this mail list for
almost 1 1/2 years...
That encourage me to start the restoration process of my dad's '68 type 2 VW
bus.
Before starting the restoration process, i was afraid of not getting new parts
that i would probably need once i get rided of the old ones.
Seals were my first fear, but now, i've got all that i need...
But, unfortunately, i found that not everything is as easy as i thought....
I need some help in finding the frames that are behind the seals in the vent
windows of the front doors....They are made of iron and mine are completely
rusty.
I've posted some pictures in my personal site:
www.jnar_dot_com

If anyone knows how to get a new pair, please help...
I know that these parts get rusty pretty bad in all VW's so anyone that made
an restoration, probably had the same problem...
I've already sent an e-mail to Justkampers_dot_com but they don't have these kind
of parts.

Thanks a lot....
Best regards from Lisbon, Portugal

Joco
'68 &quot;kamper&quot;!
