Subject: [T2] The good the bad and the freshly rebuilt

Hi All,

I have the nod to put a couple of things on the list for sale.

 I have a pair of 1700 heads of my original 73' Westy motor.
They look to be in pretty good shape (need cleaned up and a valve job)
I have two Westy sink/icebox units from 73' Westies one is very good and the
other has good parts.  Make me an offer I can't refuse.

I will also be posting a 1976 ASI Riviera soon.  My brother is finishing the
major rebuild and once it is assembled and installed the bus will be up for
sale.  I believe he has all the interior items.  It is in pretty darn good
shape, a bit of body work and a new coat of paint and that would be about
it.  No price as yet, I would be willing to hear what you all might think it
to be worth.

Thanks,
Brian Tipsword
Salem, Or
