hi all,

my rear drums are making a horrible scraping noise.  I have new brake
shoes, wheel cylinders and drums.  Here is what i think the problem is:

my backing plates have the holes so mangled that i cannot get plugs to
stay in them.  the sand from the beaches i parked on got into the drum
through this hole and have embedded in teh pad material making my brake
shoes like sandpaper ruining my new drums pretty quickly.

so, i need to know if there is any way to salvage my shoes, and i need to
either buy a good right and a good left backing plate, or have someone
tell me a good way to seal those mangled holes up.

also, i'd like to find a pair of 74 front seats for cheap.  I am getting
tired of having no head/neck support on long trips and i know that 74
seats have the same track as mine thus no welding or other modifications.
i dont care if the padding or upholstery is bad as long as the seat itself
is in good shape.

also if anyone has any ideas, please mail me personally, as i am not
subscribed to the list.  Obviously if you think your response could
benifit everyone mail the list as well, im not one to hog advice ;)

thanks,

Stephen white
