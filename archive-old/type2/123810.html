Subject: [T2] AIRS / Support Request Mendicino, CA  UPDATE

&gt;&gt; Received the update form the owner of the bus.  Apparently the fan
pulley worked look because the keyway bolt was loose.  The pulley
crashed around and mangled the end of the crankshaft.  The VW shop
down in Fort Bragg says it will be about $1750 to remove and
reinstall the engine, tear it down, replace the shaft and the front
and rear bearings and maybe the pulley.

If it were my bus, I would tow it home so it could be worked on at my own
leisure and pace, and get additional opinions. I don't know how reputable
this shop is, and I know many or most are honest, but I've seen shops that
milk a customer.

I'd want to verify that the end of the crankshaft is not in adequate
condition to reinstall the pulley, and I'd want another opinion on whether
or not the bearings need replacing. I don't remember if you friend does his
own work or not, but at least talking with local shops in his own area can
get differing options and pricing on this problem. Of course, if he is
willing to pull his own engine, he can save a lot of money, and there may be
club members, etc in his area that can listen to the engine to give advice
on the bearings.
