--Dave,

You'll find it, you just won't be able to read it. Start inside the cabin at the fresh air 'box' that originally grabs all your fresh air, work toward the driver's side on top of the ducts. Halfway between the fresh air box and the connection to the door vents (if yo have them still) you'll find it on top of the duct facing straight up. Had to shade mine onto a piece of paper with the edge of a pencil lead.
