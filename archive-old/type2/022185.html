&gt;Thanks for the warnings.  I don't know how I would ever know what was 
&gt;happening inside the sidewalls of my van after I put the wood back over 
&gt;the insulation.  I am very concerned about condensation getting between
the 
&gt;insulation and the outside metal walls.

Sorry to leave out a critical point.

I used the felt stuff only on the floors and above the engine.

As for side walls, you want to make sure that whatever you use will not
absorb and hold any  moisture.  Any exterior/side wall condensation, or
leaks, should be allowed to freely fall on down the walls and out of the
weep holes. 

The last thing you want to do is entrap moisture within the insulation, or
between the insulation and the walls, so as to cause an aggravated rust
situation from trapped water accumulation.

Sorry I wasn't clear on where I used the felt and aluminum.
