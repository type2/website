Subject: 78 windsheild wipers don't work
Message-ID: &lt;19990524011959.3877.rocketmail_at_web103.yahoomail_dot_com&gt;

Hey Volks,

Almost done sorting out my first Westy ('78 2.0L, FI,
auto). PO had it sitting for 2 years, It now *runs*
(compression 120,125,100,135) and *drives*.


I need to get the windshield wipers to work. The
wipers blow the fuse when I switch them on. Any
testing tips, or suggestions on where to start whould
be appreciated. 

Did what I like to call the &quot;Inspection Dance&quot; this
weekend. This is when you walk around the van to see
if all the lights (directional, brake, reverse, etc.)
work. Fixed the the directionals and hazard lights,
and I can't seem to figure out whats shorting out the
wipers. 

TIA 

John Perry
