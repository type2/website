Subject: Problem with my fuel pump (I guess)

Hi all !!

Once again I must remenber you all that I have never had a VW  of any
kind in my entire life (well,  my dad bought a new Bettle back in 65 and
had it for 4 years but it doesn't  count) I do mechanics in my spare
time BUT NEVER EVER have had the oportunity to place my hands on a VW
engine before, untill now the I have this 73 Transporter.   Few days
back I posted a note saying that my pankace engine is leaking oil
apparently from everywere and is producing a lot of smoke because the
oil is dropping on the heaters.  I received some suggestions and I'm
working on it.  Now there's aproblem that I been having since the
beggining but dind't mentioned and is the fact that when I get stuck in
a traffic jam (twice a day) and it gets very hot, suddently the engine
stops.  I'm full with gas and the engine doesn't start,  I pour
gassoline directly in the carbs and the engine starts for a seccond and
then dies again,  then I take off the main gas line from the
LH/carburator and crank the engine and no gas comes out.  It isn't
untill 20 to 30 minutes that the engine starts with no problem.  This is
happening to me every 10 to 15 days.  What could it be ?.  I mean its
definetly the gas pump but what is going on ?. Why does it works some
times and some time not ?.  I'm looking forward to installing an
electric fuel pump, but since then, I have to deal with this.
 Has this ever happened to anybody in the list ??. Any comentaries are
highly appreciated.    Thanks  !!!!.

Regards,
Pedro/
Caracas - Venezuela.
