Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum hose for brake booster

Because the original hose is wire-reinforced to prevent collapsing, the only
usual source has been the dealer at an obscene price and is sold per meter.

On Bay Windows I've owned in the past and on my current Vanagons, I chose to
use oil cooler pressure hose, 1/2&quot; ID that is supplied by EMPI or Bugpack
(Dee Engineering).  This hose is heavily reinforced for high pressure use
and does not collapse.  Been working great for me for the past two decades
now. Check your local VW FLAPS.

YMMV

&gt; What is the right hose to use as vacuum hose to the power brake booster?
&gt; When I hooked mine up through using the metal line I got a slower idle.
&gt; (from about 1000rpm to 700rpm). I'm assuming this is a vacuum leak.
&gt; I used some hose I found at NAPA. It is &quot;double reinforced&quot; hose. Although
&gt; it doesn't specifically say heater hose, I think thats what it is intended
&gt; to be. It is higher quality than their standard heater hose. It has a
&gt; thicker rubber inner lining and an the outer layer is red. They guy told
&gt; me
&gt; it wouldn't collapse. I don't completely believe that.
&gt; I used it to connect the check valve to the long metal pipe that runs up
&gt; to
&gt; the booster. I'm going to buy some more to connect it all the way from the
&gt; check valve to the booster and eliminate the rusty metal pipe.
&gt; What would be a better hose to use?
