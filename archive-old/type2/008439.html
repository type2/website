Check out what else this guy is selling!  I think that is a '71 foot... or
is it a '74?!

: A guy I've been communicating with is selling a bus with a VIN number:
2212271111. If memory serves me, this is '71--his title and dash VINs
match; I told him to check the one in the engine compartment, but he hasn't
gotten back to me on that. 
: 
: HOWEVER!!!, the picture doesn't even remotely resemble a '71. MANY too
many differences. See what you think:

: 
: I'm guessing '77 because of the high seats and the sink vent on the
driver's side. Ideas appreciated.

: Thanks! Joe
