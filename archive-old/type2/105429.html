Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Temps/A Long Rant

David, I've got the same gauge set up as you in my '98 Lincoln MK VIII. 240+ 
around town, cool weather. Put my foot in it, and that quad cam 4.6L goes to 
300+ in the blink of an eye. 122k mi. 5-30 Mobil One from day one, and not a 
lick of trouble. I don't even think about it. Hell my '87 GSXR 1100 has seen 
temps on long screaming (130mph+) trans-desert runs of close to 400, without 
a problem. This again with Mobile One products. Bus Content. Your all invited 
to come see my '78 Westy with 135k mi. that has flawless compression and leak 
down, that regularly sees temps of 250+ at EveryBus.
