&gt;&gt; Wasn't this message originally posted by a list member (Russ?), not
delivered directly to the type2_dot_com list by the vendor?  And even if it was
delivered directly to the list, could we really consider it to be &quot;spam&quot;? &lt;&lt;

no, it was not sent to the list, it was sent to individuals. this is
precisely what all the fuss is about. it is stictly prohibited in the
list charter. if he is in fact a list member, he should know better.

this person knowingly harvested email addresses, which is just plain
bad netiquette.

i think if this person would have posted to the list _instead_ of
sending to individuals, there would be no fuss at all!

&gt;&gt; I
tend to think of spam as unwanted mail from porn sites, sites promising to
increase the size of my manhood or the occasional get rich quick scheme.  It
is in no way directed toward me personally, or to any of my interests. &lt;&lt;

i guess it depends on your definition of spam. to me, it is any unsolicited
email that is in regards of purchase of services or products that i didn't
ask for.

&gt;&gt;  Of course, that is just my oppinion and I could be wrong.  Your mileage may
vary etc...  &lt;&lt;

&amp; you are very much entitled to it. we can 'agree to disagree'.

have a nice weekend,
