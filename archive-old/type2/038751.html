&gt; I am currently putting new brakes all the way around my 77 Westy and have run

why is it that EVERYONE treats a late bus rear axle like a beetle or early
bus...

Your bus has a composite drum, remove the drum and leave the hub alone
unless you are working on bearings or the stub axle.

Look for 1 or 2 (cant remember) 10 MM bolts holding the drum to the hub,
remove those then bang the drum off of the hub, they separate.  This is in
the bently.. look at the pictures.

If you have run your bus without rear hubcaps for any length of time
figure the hub will be rusted to the drum. Yes, hubcaps have afunction
other than looks ;) Use heat and penetrating oil to separate em, but there
is no reason on gods green earth to touch the big axle nut for brakes on a
77 bus. (short of some bright person welding the drum to the hub... or
putting in 68-70 wide 5 rear end)

take care,

Steve
