You're not going to get accurate readings with an off-the-shelf O2 sensor.
They are &quot;narrow band&quot; and basically will only tell you if you're really
rich, really lean, or sortof okay.  Wideband O2 sensors cost hundreds of
dollars, which is why usually only shops will have them.

The second problem is that the exhaust gas analyzer is only going to give
you readings for idle and fast idle, unless you put the thing in your bus
and drive around with it stuck in the tailpipe.  &quot;Goosing&quot; the throttle
will not help - you need to sustain the engine under load to get an
accurate reading.  You need either a chassis dyno or a portable measuring
device.
