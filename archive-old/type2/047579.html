Subject: Re: [T2] VW Emblem

I've bought a few aftermarket ones from RMMW *very expensive* they were a
whole lot lighter than the originals, and they were stamped *on the side
facing out, no less* either,  China, or Taiwan.

If you come across  more of them that are in reasonably good shape, *for: 71
bus, original, or aftermarket*  Let me know, I have a buyer for them.

Btw, does any one *Nikki* have one of the rear Decklid Script &quot;Volkswagen&quot;
pieces for a 71 bus?  Please let me know, I have a buyer for two of them, as
well.

&gt; How do you tell if a VW emblem is authentic?? I got one from a junkyard
for
&gt; 20 bucks at a junkyard and it looks authentic but you never know. Are
there
&gt; any telltale signs to look for ??
