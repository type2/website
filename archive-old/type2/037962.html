Subject: 79 Bus Wiring Diagram req'd.

Hi Volks,

I have just started into the 79 I picked up from a karma-enriched
list-member, and since I've elected to swap the motor and transmission out
of my seriously rusted 1973 Westy myself ...

          OK, that's stretching the truth. Actually,  *another*
          generous listmember has offered to help with that
          project, I'd be lost on my own under there. Otherwise
          I'd be paying someone to do it, and not learning
          nearly so much.

... I want to get as much else done as possible to make the bus road-ready
when the motor swap happens in a month or so.

The first order of business is to get the front rotors checked, and either
have them turned or replaced. Following that, I want to check the electrical
system... Lights, horn, etc. I already had a pro check the suspension and
steering components, he says they're fine. The tires are crap, but they will
be coming off my 73 Westy.

I've looked around in the engine compartment,  and while the battery  tray
is complete, there are no leads to connect it. I suppose they came out with
the motor ;^).  

Question: Of the many wires that are left dangling in the engine
compartment, what lead do I connect to the positive side of the battery to
power the rest of the electrical system?

If anyone has a scan of a wiring diagram for a 1979 bus please send it to
greg-potts_at_home_dot_com and I'll add your name to the list of Karma-enriched
people who've helped keep a bus on the road and a list-member (and his
family)  in a bus.

THANKS!! (esp. to list-members Matt and Denmeister, respectively)
