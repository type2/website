Subject: Re: [T2] CHT Wows and Concerns

Hi Wayne,

How fast were you going, and how long and steep was the hill?

Dropped valve seats usually occur when the engine is fully heat- 
soaked AND an addition load is placed on the engine, generating heat  
that has nowhere to go. If the engine can't radiate the heat to the  
environment, the cylinder heads get hot and the metal softens up and  
the seats break loose. That's something to avoid wherever possible.

If you were cruising at 75MPH, the engine was probably pretty well  
soaked with heat. Same applies to a long moderately steep hill. It  
only takes a minute or two for heat to build up in the heads.

I've driven at 450 for a while on occaision, but I always try to ease  
off the pedal as soon as possible. Coming back from EveryBus 2004 I  
was on the highway with a 40MPH headwind, the only option was to drop  
down to 3rd gear and poke along at 50 with the hazard lights on.

There are a lot of other factors affecting engine heat. Cooling tin,  
and ignition timing are just two of them. Verify that these are in  
good shape ASAP to be on the safe side.

Note: is there anyone out there with a CHT gauge running ethanol  
blended fuel? My understanding is that ethanol is a leaner-running  
fuel than gasoline, and it would be useful to know if that translates  
into higher head temps.


Happy trails,
