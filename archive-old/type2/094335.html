Subject: FS: '78 Champagne Edition Westy

Life, work and a strong desire to move means that I've got to let this
project go - preferably to a good home on the list. I'm located in
south-eastern Virginia

Details:
- 1978 Champagne Edition Westy.
- Complete, including stove/sink/fridge/bed/tables/stool
- Engine and tranny are out, waiting on me to find time to finish replacing
gas lines. Half are done.
- Engine rebuilt locally (Whiteheads VW) and runs good
- Tranny rebuilt
- fuel filler neck, main filler line and shift bushings and couplings have
replaced
- rear side and back hatch windows are out for surface rust removal, new
rubber included
- Rust free except for slight surface rust here and there. NO rust-through
or pitting
- paint is in ok shape, not great
- garage kept
- owner documentation and manuals

This is a great bus for a person who has the time to work with it. I don't.
I do, however, have a large stash (I'm a pack-rat) of parts that can be had
with a purchase (FI, interior, glass, tables, stools).

If you're interested, come take a look and make an offer, preferably over
2k. Pics and details available on request.
