Hi All:

Anyone out there done a summer road trip from Southern California to the
Idaho and Wyoming areas? I'm thinking of a trip next month going up I-15 but
it sure looks hot, like over 100 degrees F., until well into the mountains
of Wyoming and Idaho. Is this as hot as it looks or are there some cooler
areas along the way that I'm not seeing? At those temps it doesn't look like
much fun for me or my poor engine.

Any feedback from someone who's done this is much appreciated.
