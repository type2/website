Subject: list referral

for extraneous reasons, we've added an '86 Saab 900 16-valve
to the stable.  can anyone prvide either
 (1) where a mailing list like this one is for that car
 (2) any obvious things that type IIs have trained me to 
 do that I better not do with this baby

reply by email to me -- this is enough wasted bandwidth
