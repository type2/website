&gt; I would think a much easier way to cut something up would be with a Henrob
&gt; &gt; 2000 cutting torch which is an amazing piece of kit...
&gt; 
&gt; Problem is, many yards prohibit the use of torches. :(
&gt; 
FWIW:

I showed a friend (who does actually weld) the Henrob site...He was not
impressed and said the results were more skill than torch...Myself, I
aint got either the skill or the torch...but would rather hear from some-
one who has tried the Henrob...Just a case of it seems too good to be
true/that easy... ;-(
