Subject: P &amp; C back on the road again

Well long story short, we had minimal damage.  Dan, of Bug Man in 
Templeton, was able to surface the crankshaft and flywheel, install new 
dowels (yes they were pretty snug and not oversized), replace the shims 
(we can show you the concave ones we removed), and torqued a Super HD 
gland nut to 400ftlbs.  The engine went back in nicely with no further 
mishaps and started like a trooper.  We left our yard hosts, Chris and 
family, and headed back to brother's to drop of his pickup.  We will 
leave Pismo early tomorrow morning and head for BYOB.

Thank you once again for all of the folks who had ideas, suggestions, 
possible engines.  We were fortunate to catch the problem early with 
minimal damage and downtime.

Unfortunately heard from friends of ours who also had engine problem, 
notice loss of power and went to check the valves, #3 exhaust spring not 
returning.  He is pulling his engine instead of hitting BYOB.  Not a 
good weekend for engines.

P &amp; C
Crusin' up 101 early tomorrow headed for BYOB/KP
