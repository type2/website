Subject: Re: [T2] Legal assistance in Cincinnati

Rick- The repairs were $3,400 plus legal fees already paid as well as 
other expenses. So it is no longer a small claims issue. The collection 
of the money is the other reason for the lawyer.

Scott- No his name wasn't Todd Hill. And thanks for the link.

Eric- He rated it a #2 on Samba which means it &quot;needs no major 
mechanical repairs&quot;, as well as claiming all new window seals (not all 
were replaced), new clutch (cable was , ready to snap and bushing was 
trashed), new canvass (replaced 1997, not even by him), and new paint 
(which was again, done by a PO, not him , in 1999).
Also my Dad is an Episcopal priest so I know there's a range of clerical 
behavior and misbehavior (they are after all human).

We tried talking thru it with the guy as well as mediation neither worked.
We don't like going the litigation route to solve this or any other 
problem, but it's our last resort.
And we know at the very least that one day his karma will run over his 
own dogma.

Anyway, if anyone has other leads on Volks who are lawyers, or just a 
lawyer who you had a good experience with would be appreciated.
Thanks,
cd
