Subject: engine won't turn over

I just finished installing a rebuilt motor in my 78 Westy. I am trying 
to turn the motor over with the
key and it's not working. It's a new starter and it works when I jump a 
wire from the spade terminal
to the terminal the battery is on. When I apply voltage to the wire 
connected to the spade terminal
I hear the fuel pump run. There was a Ford relay of some kind on it that 
I removed when I pulled the
engine. As of now I have several solid red wires,a red with white 
stripe,a red with a black stripe and
the positive from battery hooked to one post on the starter and I have a 
smaller gauge red with white stripe (female spade connector) hooked up 
to the male spade connector. I tried using the wire diagram
in my Bentley,but ended up more confused than before. Any help or ideas 
needed. I am going to bring
my kids on an easter egg hunt than I'll be back to take another attack 
at it.
