&gt;My Questions
&gt;1. The gas question...is it really okay to run 87 octane?
Mine runs fine on the low test stuff.

&gt;2. Oil-I live in sacramento, where it gets about 100 degrees on 
&gt;average in
&gt;the summer-I'm using strait 30 weight now-should I change?
For that temp, I'd use straight 40 weight.
When in the cool temps or cool season, go to 30 weight.
When I run in the desert where it gets really hot, I go to straight 50, 
but everyone tells me not too, even though motorcycle guys been doing 
that for years.
When it gets to 100+ degrees, and it gets to be 110-120 on the pavement 
where the engine is just hanging above that temp, and I'm running on 
the road on a long haul, I'll still go to straight 50 every time.

Right now, here in Houston, I'm full of 40 weight for the Summer.
I never use multi-grade.

&gt;3. Speed-How fast should I drive on the freeway-it screams past 60mph
Slow down, let people see how cool you are.
Once you blow your engine, you'll be pissed forever.
The reason people drive fast is because they don't enjoy their wheels.
We're different.
We know what we have, so let's enjoy the glide.
Cruise between 55 and 60.
Just get into the mind set of knowing your ride is better than those 
fast people that don't like staying in the wheels longer than they have 
to.

Hey, when we get where we're going, it's over.
