Subject: front door seals...procedure?
Mime-Version: 1.0

I recently purchased a complete set for doing my front door seals on my 75 
Westy.  To be honest, I have some parts that I just don't have any idea as 
to where they go.....

So, has anyone come up with a good procedure for replacing all of this 
razzmatazz?  I need to do all of this before I do my door panels and put in 
the speakers...since the doors leak, hence the purchase of door seals.

Any information would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks volks!
