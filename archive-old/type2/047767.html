If I get around to my to do list, I plan to use large head &quot;Dutz&quot; fasteners.  They are
spring loaded, cam lock fasteners that attach to the receptical installed into the
frame.  There are many types and styles, but they won't rust up.  I'd run the panels to
cover the rectangular box frame portion of the frame.  Plastic screws sound
interesting.
