With adapter your options are unlimited. I have a set of Porsche 15 inch  
teledials on my 87 Vanagon. The adapters fit on bus and Eurovan also. I have a  
set of 16 inch teledials I'm putting on next. Alot of people don't like 
adapters  but, I have run them on different vehicles for many years and not one 
problem. I  check them every once in a while for tightness and they have never  
loosened. I just check them anyways. With a torque wrench of course. Good luck  
and happy hunting.
