Hello all,

 I hope I don't get banned for replying to this subject !! As you may have
heard, we had a little storm around here and of course, the electricity was
out for 2 days. I just retired from the US Air Force and now I am employed
as a service manager for a golf car company. Don't laugh, all gas powered
golf cars are air cooled!!

 I own a 73 Westy and just had it repainted in Febuary. The shop I had the
paint job done at no longer exsist due to it being blown away by the
tornado. I was very lucky, the tornado passed about 1/2 mile away from me
and my bus didn't recieve any damage.
