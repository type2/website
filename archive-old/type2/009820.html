Subject: Ticking...???
Message-Id: &lt;199906132106.RAA96916_at_pimout2-int.prodigy_dot_net&gt;

hi folks, i took a drive out to archland bug out last weekend, it was about
a 2and a half hour drive, one way. Bus was tuned and running well before
that as far as  I could tell. It got a little hot half way there, when I
checked the heat by touching the dip stick. but I plodded on... when I
actually got into to town, and slowed down, (was in a lower gear, 3rd or
2nd) I heard a higher piched ticking than loose valve ticking, and a poor
idle during which I get a popping sound.  Im afraid a rod might have gone
but I have no idea. Since then Ive checked timing, tach dwell, and valves,
they were fine.  The ticking is not constant, it ticks seemingly randomly,
but only in a low gear, driving slowly.
please If you have any ideas, let me know.

thankx tons
joshua
