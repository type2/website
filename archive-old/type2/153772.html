Subject: newbie question about mechanical fuel pump on type IV engine

Hello,

I'm new to the type IV engine. I'm putting together a dual carb '73 bus that
someone else gave up on. Although there is an electric pump on the frame rail,
the engine has a mechanical fuel pump.  I would rather use the mechanical
pump, at least until I determine if the electric pump has a relay and/or
cutoff. I'm just going to make sure the electric pump doesn't have a 12 volt
supply for now. None of  fuel lines on the mechanical pump are not connected,
and I'm not sure how to connect them.   I bought a Bently book on the advice
on the archive. It has been helpful, but I haven't found a description that
shows how the fuel lines should be connected. I searched the archive and I
didn't find a explanation. I could experiment by moving the lines around and
tunring the engine by hand, but I would prefer to have some clue.

The mechanical pump has two ports above the pump body, and one port below the
pump. Does anyone out there know how these three ports on the mechanical pump
should be connected, or know of an posting in the archive that explains this?



Thank You,

Ray
