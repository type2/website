Hiya Jonny,

It means check your brake system now.  That little brake warning light comes 
on when sensors on the master cylinder detect a problem.  In all liklihood 
one of your brake circuits may have failed.  Does the Bus seem a little 
harder to stop since you've noticed the light?  In any event, check over that 
brake system.
By the way, that warning light is spring loaded.  Pressing it should cause it 
to light.  That serves as a check that the warning system is working.

Mike
