Subject: Central Ohio Gathering

Hello Volks,
Happy Friday ...

A quick note on Dixie Bus Gathering, to be held in Central Ohio on the
second weekend of August.  This is the 5th year for this event, and has a
nice small following.  
Dixie Bus is held on the same weekend as the Central Ohio Vintage Volkswagen
Club show.  They tout this show as the largest single day event East of the
Mississippi.  Usually over 400 registered vehicles.
So we have something for everyone... Camping in beautiful Rustic Knolls
Campground, a vintage car show for the enthusiast, and huge cauldron of
chili for those who like to eat!!
Here are a couple of links if needed
