I sent him an email, letting him know that, instead of generating possible
business for himself, he only managed to p*ss off a bunch of people.

&gt; &gt; This came to my home email, which is not subscribed to the Type 2 list.
At
&gt; &gt; this point, I don't know how he got my name.  Could have been the AIRS
list,
&gt; &gt; I suppose.
&gt;
&gt; So far my investigation shows he harvested addresses from the AIRS list on
&gt; the website.  (which, for some folks, is different from their
&gt; list-subscribed address)

I think that this is right.  My AIRS address is the one that got spammed.
Perhaps it is time to munge the addresses on the AIRS site?
