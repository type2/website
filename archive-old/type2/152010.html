&gt; Hey Bob - if ya like the stuff - check out Costco.  I figure I'll just stick

nearest Costco is about 30 miles away.....

&gt; with the stuff now - most of the responses seem to be positive on this

&gt; you should do frequent oil changes anyway - but I figure - I'm only paying

I change oil with synthetic at about 5k miles but 78 has full flow
filter too and I change it at every oil change

&gt; about $3 Cdn more per litre - over ... a bus seasons worth of oil changes so
&gt; how much more am I spending per year - maybe $30 Cdn - a small price to pay

my season is all year, this is my daily driver.  but your right only a few
dollars more per year and considering how much I dump into it anyway

&gt; given the money I funnel into buses anyway.  Also ... I notice that in cold
&gt; weather it is pretty tough to start my 60 if I have heavy oil in it.  Yet
&gt; when I put 5w/30 in it will start right up (well - start anyway).  With the

I ski and cranking that baby up at 0F with no support avaliable I have
good winter oil and plenty big batteries.

&gt; oil to 5w/30 and it started right up - I'm sure lighter oil must be way
&gt; better in the 78 in cold weather as well ... so with the 5w/50 I should be
&gt; able to use the same oil in the late fall and early spring.

I use it year round.

&gt; BUT - I just did a very very long trip - almost 7K I would guess - and
&gt; burned about 3/4 of a litre of oil - I wondered if the lighter 5w/50 would
&gt; get past the rings easier than say ... 20w/50.

don't have any problems getting past the rings,  push rod tube seals is
another story, gotta keep em perfect.
