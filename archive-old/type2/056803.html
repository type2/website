Hi Volks,

&gt; &gt; Dooes anyone know of a source for the nose of a 68-71? The cataloges
&gt; &gt; show early bus and post- 73, but nothing for these years.

Whereupon &quot;J.W.Brier&quot; &lt;Jan_at_hrps_dot_demon.nl&gt; replied:

&gt; Someone else mentioned that he took a '73-'79 front and relocated the
&gt; blinkers as that is about the difference between the pre and after
&gt; '73.

Not quite - the front grille above the headlights is wider in 68-72
than in 73-79, and has more rounded corners.  This doesn't mean it's 
impossible to use a 73-79 nose panel, but as the song says: if you're 
gonna do it, do it right!  Maybe cut the grille section from the old 
nose panel?  Detail pics of both versions can be found on our Web 
site following the links to Archives, Model Changes.  HTH.

Yours,
    Erik.
