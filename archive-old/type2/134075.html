Subject: speaking of sheet metal sorta

... i have a schofield replacement battery tray and rear panel; they 
did not come with a battery holddown, and i have yet to see one in 
the FLAPS that look right; there is a vertical piece to the right of 
the battery, and a hole with a captive nut on the left. this is on a 
70.  anyone have a pointer to a picture, or a name brand to look for?
