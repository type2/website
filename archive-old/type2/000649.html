X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

To the list, I recently read about the rack replating and wanted to pass on
some information that I recently found out about.  I recently purchased, but
have not install a roof rack from PIP for my 79 Loaf.  In talking with PIP,
Greg recommended that I use a product call Hammerite for all the unpainted
areas of the rack.  This recommendation is based on the weather here in the
Pacific Northwest.  Hammerite comes in a12 oz spray can. According to the
label, &quot;It contains millions of heat hardened glass flakes interlocked with
special resins.  It is self priming, high-gloss that takes the place of
primer, basecoat, topcoat and dries in 15 minutes.  It can be painted
directly over rust.&quot;  I have also tried this over some patio furniture and
really works very nice.  Got it at home base.
