Subject: [T2] Leaking Distributer

Ok, so it sounds like I have to pull the distributer to put a new O ring in 
there and/or check the distributer drive shaft(sorry if thats not the right 
word).

So, is it bad to have this oil leaking out of the distributer(its not that 
much)?  How long can I go before I fix it and what sort of performance 
symptoms, if any, does this cause?

Thanks for all your help.  I'm sure the mechanic will say he put a new o 
ring in there, so I think I'm just gonna attempt this one myself.

TIA

kim and mike
