Volks,

this is a sad day.  The man didn't get to my attention until this 
day, although he contributed to the L*xus ad spoof.  Only now did I 
find his homepage and went to explore what a great guy he must have 
been.

He was just another listee for me when he was alive.  I feel shame 
now, and a sense of loss and loneliness.  

May he rest in peace.

Sadly,
    Erik.
