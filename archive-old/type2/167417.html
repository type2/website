Subject: Re: [T2] Westy mini spare tires?

Hi Dave,

Jamie Rivers tried inflating a never-used 1974 space saver spare at  
the June Jitterbug car show back in 2002 or '03... it never came up  
to pressure and was not roadworthy. AFAIK it had never previously  
been out of the cabinet in its entire lifetime.

If anyone on the list is still carrying one of those spares, I would  
strongly suggest you ditch it and get a real spare, or carry a can of  
fix-a-flat in the glove compartment.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
