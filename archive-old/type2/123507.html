Subject: Hydrauilic lifter confession

My son disassembled his engine '78 T4 FI a few years back and just left it in 
the garage.  I have it together and &quot;mostly&quot; in the bus.  The lifters were in 
a coffee can with no clues as to their original home.  Anybody see where I'm 
going with this?

From reading this thread it doesn't sound real great, but is it necessarily 
always that bad to haphazardly install these bad boys?
