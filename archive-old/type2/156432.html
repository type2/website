Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor Question

I'm happy to report that the new vacuum canister from Sherco works great.  I installed it last
night and drove the Bus into work this morning.  No hesitation during shifting, power is back to
normal, engine runs cool.  

The total for the part was $45 ($39.95 for the canister plus $6 shipping).  I ordered it online
Friday morning, and it was in my mailbox when I returned home Monday afternoon.  Part says made in
Germany and came in a Bosch box (although the box was opened).

My wife and I took the Bus this past weekend (with the 009 installed) for some south eastern
Indiana sightseeing (about 120 miles round trip).  Did notice the typical hesitation on
acceleration, but didn't really mind it since the Bus was running so well.  Inpsired me enough to
call the local tire shop and order a set of Hankook RA08 tires (should be here Friday!).
