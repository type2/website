&gt; This looks like a fairly attractive approach.  Poking around the 'net,
&gt; I find a fair number of options for making use of a wideband O2

The sensor is the cheap part, it's the electronics to drive it that can 
be more pricey.

Although it's still in development, I'd keep an eye out for the 
Precision Wideband Controller from the same guys that designed the 
MegaSquirt.  It will definitely be a very cool (and better priced) unit 
when it comes out, especially when you'll be able to hook it up to your 
MegaSquirt and dial in your AFR!
