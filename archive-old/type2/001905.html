This will be an experiment, I guess, but I just put a Brazilian muffler on,
purchased when my local VW FLAPS turned out unexpectedly to be out of the
Danish or German, and I didn't want to wait.  It went on very well, even the
heat risers only needed a tiny bit of persuasive alignement, and lined up
with the heat boxes perfectly on the second assembly (odd, but true).
Before mounting I wiped it down and coated it with two coats of high temp
paint.  If I have to do it again, I guess I'll have learned a lesson, but so
far so good.
