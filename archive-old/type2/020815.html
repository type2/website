&gt; &gt; Sorry, the final drive section of an Auto is cast iron, not Aluminum. I have
&gt; &gt; had several of these, currently have an 85 with Auto. I even shipped an Auto

&gt; he was talking about the bell housing ring, not the final drive....I know
&gt; the drive itself is steel but I thought the bell housing ring was
&gt; aluminum, pretty sure mine is???

Bob, Scott, Adam:
Bear in Mind that Adam's car is a 75 and they used 003 transaxles 73-75. I believe
the final drive and bellhousing are all cast iron.
BTW, I have one available, but it's from a type 4 and I think the ratios are
different. (A LOT different, like 3.75 to 1.) 73's are 4.45 to 1 and 74-75 are 4.36
to 1.  in addition, I'm not 100% sure the housing is the same, I know type 4's used
a slightly different trans mount. Probably more trouble than it's worth to set up
type 2 gears in a type 4 case.
It  can't be THAT hard to find one from a 75.
