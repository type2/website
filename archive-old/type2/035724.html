I think I found the problem. I installed a known-good temp sensor and
assumed it's still good. Although I suspect the sensor itself is good, I
think the installation may have been bad. In an archive message, Karl (bus
guru) von Salzen wrote:

I believe I have the same problem, as I installed the sensor with
antiseize. Actually, I installed a sensor on each head, both with
antiseize. One is reading around 950, the other about 1247, both when the
bus is cold. Should be up around 2500-4000.

Got a cubscout thing right now, but I'll check this theory this afternoon.

Thanks! Joe
