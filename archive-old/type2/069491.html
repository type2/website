Subject: Re: Valve Adjustment - Procedure

Glen Buhlman writes up a routine whereby you can adjust all eight valves in
just two stops of the crankshaft.  And it's probably correct, but I can
never remember the rules for what valve to do when.  The fact is you can
adjust valve lash anywhere on the heel of the cam, that is, anywhere on the
roughly 2/3rds of the cam's rotation that isn't raised.  So for each valve
I want to adjust, I turn the engine until the valve goes in, comes out, and
a little more.  This works for 4 cyl, 6 cyl, OHC, DOHC, intake, exhaust,
VW, Honda, whatever.  Costs you the effort of turning the engine over a
lot, but I need the exercise and I HATED losing my place when I was using
Muir's approach or whatever.

We need a sermon from -Bob on this.  He can probably tell us what brand of 
soda pop comes in .006in. thick cans.
