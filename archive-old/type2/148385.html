Subject: Re: [T2] Deep sump systems?

I have one on my Type IV that belongs to the Beetle. Mine came from Scat. Fit fine, works fine. Me thinks it helps supply cool oil and keep oil at the pump on hard corners. It does really slow the warmup of the oil at cooler temps. Might be a BAD idea in certain parts of the country in the winter. Remove in the Fall and reattach in the Spring if you like...

Beware - at least on my Beetle - at certain speeds the suspension will compress to it's max point (lowest point) when crossing a speed bump putting your engine at risk. No damage yet...
