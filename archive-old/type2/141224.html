Subject: Re: [T2] More KONI's Now Available!

Hello Volks

I still remember the nigth a few months ago when answering a question that 
somebody posted to the list I said I have Koni's in my bus, from them 
Richard leads the technicals and Ron the comercials that end in the 
possibility of some new owners of Koni's for their buses, I have been 
following the Koni's thread since the beginig, saddly the fact is they are 
uncommon for many people and unfortunaly you will not know how well teir 
perform until you try them for that reason the price seems too high.
Like Bob said you get what you pay for and all depends how you use your bus 
and your budget of course, $100 for a shock, yes is big money but $100 for a 
Koni for the VW type2 is an invesment if you are going to keep a bus for a 
long time, even without a life  time warraty that is my case because in my 
country there is no way to get them rebuild if was necesary.
I use my Westfalia as a daily driver and in my home town if it is not uphill 
is downhill and always twisted roads, after drived my friend 1970 Westy that 
I do not dare to drive at 40% of hard of mine just because it has 
conventional tires and KYB shocks I realiced how much improve a set of tires 
and shocks can add to a VW bus.
My advice if you want to take it is BUY them if you can afford them, ENJOY 
them if you already have them, DO NOT TRY THEM if you can get them because 
you will fall in love.

Roberto
