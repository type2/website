I'm the lucky owner of an ongoing starting problem.

The starting problem manifests itself as an (apparently) flooded
engine.  I no longer think it is the carb's problem, and working
backwards I'm at the fuel pump.

take off the fuel line where it attaches to the carb.   stick the end in a
wadded up rag, and go turn the key for a few seconds.   Check the rag- if
there is lots of gas you are fine.   dry?   problemo.  Alternately, have a
friend turn the key while you watch for the strong pulsating stream of
gasoline.   Dont hold the line pointing at your face.    :)   Do you have gas
in the tank?
