Subject: Door parts and mis. parts for sale!!!

Hello List,

Well here are a few things that I have for sale.
Everything shown is in used condition. Nothing is new.
The door latch works beautifully. I will take $12.00
for it as well as the handle and anything that goes
with it. The flip window turns easily. The latch on it
works well. It does have some rust on the frame but it
is still very usable. I would like $10.00 for it. The
large window glass does have a few light scratches in
it but it looks good. It is much better than having no
glass at all. I want $5.00 for it. I would like $4.00
for the window felt. It is in usable condition with
some wear at the bottom. It has all of its clips. The
ash tray is in ok condition with some rust inside. I
want $2.00 for it. I want $2.00 for the red lens. I
will take $2.00 for the door stop thingy. Let me know
if you see anything that you need. Here is the link.

I will also be parting out the passanger door. Thanks
and have a nice day!

David Kelly
