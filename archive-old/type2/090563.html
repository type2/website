Clark is having some difficulties posting to
T2_dot_com so I forwarded for him.  

Could one of the admin's talk to him.  He seems
to have difficulting resubscribing with the

Subject: [OVT] PLEASE POST TO THE TYPE2 LIST:
Weber manifold problem

Hey Ray/OHVbussers, 
I'm shooting for the Dixie gathering.  All i
need is the time to put the engine in and tweak
it a bit.  Fingers crossed!

I ask a favor.  Can someone who is a member of
the type2 list post this to that list and ask for
replies to be posted to that list(or this list)?
I can't  post to them from here as i am
prohibited from using freemail. 

Thanks. 

Just before bed the other night, i was
contemplating my Weber DFEV and its manifold -
the kind for the type4 conversion. It sits
rebuilt on my dresser awaiting installation. 

I noticed something - perhaps a new shortcoming
of this setup.  The carb functions such that the
primary throttle barrel does most of the work;
the secondary only begins to open at maybe a
little  under half throttle - maybe more, maybe
less. Anyway, the manifold is designed in such
away that the barrels  of the carb line up over
the manifold ports that connect to the runners
that go to either cylinders 1&amp;3 or 2&amp;4.

If the carb sits so that you're looking at the
main idle screw when you look into the engine
compartment (normal position), then the primary
throttle body sits in line with (over) the ports
for 2&amp;4. 

Now, i know all four cylinders should pull the
mixture at the same rate, but if the mixture
exits the carb directly over the ports for #2&amp;4
(a couple inches away from the ports for #1&amp;3), i
figure one of  two things may be happening: 
&gt; 1. #s 2&amp;4 are running rich 
&gt; 2. #s 1&amp;3 are running lean until the secondary
&gt; opens. 
&gt; Now, my knowledge of fluid dynamics and flow is
&gt; very limited and it 
&gt; may be that when the mixture hits the manifold,
&gt; it gets distributed 
&gt; evenly, but it just doesn't seem that way. If
&gt; you hold a lit 
&gt; cigarette behind two fans of equal strength but
&gt; a little closer to 
&gt; one of the fans than the other, the smoke will
&gt; get sucked through the 
&gt; fan it is closer to, correct? 
&gt; 
&gt; A solution to this would be a manifold that
&gt; looks more like a type1 
&gt; manifold, where the mixture is joined into one
&gt; pipe after the carb 
&gt; manifold and then split into the two ports at
&gt; the manifold on the 
&gt; head. 
&gt; 
&gt; I saw one of these - for a type4 engine - on
&gt; ebay a while back but 
&gt; haven't been able to find it since. I think
&gt; this kit had an IDF 
&gt; sitting on it. 
&gt; Installed on a bus, this intake system would
&gt; appear to have a solid 
&gt; pipe (runner)on the right (from the carb
&gt; manifold to the head) and a 
&gt; split runner on the left with a boot joining
&gt; the cut. Shiny, chrome 
&gt; thing. Mighty purdy. 
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone else seen these? Its probably a
&gt; porsche marketed part. 
&gt; 
&gt; Please post replies to the type2 list, as i
&gt; can't read email here at 
&gt; work. A friend is posting this for me. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for reading and, with all due respect,
&gt; please don't tell me to 
&gt; go buy a set of duals or convert to FI. I just
&gt; don't have that kind 
&gt; of money or time. 
&gt; 
&gt; sincerely,
