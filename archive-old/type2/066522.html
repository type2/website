Subject: Re: request for advice:  should I keep the Jetta too?

Earlier this year, I owned Maggie, my 1976 westy (at least 150k), an
incredibly reliable, economical and practical 89 Toyota 4wd with a mere 49k
mi (read just broken in), and a new computer for which I was $2300 in debt.

The creditors started pressing for the bread, and my only assets were the
aforementioned vehicles.  So which did I get rid of?  Well I'm still on the
list ain't I?

Which of course makes me, and most of those on the list, complete lunatics.

But go with the bus.  Sell the Jetta and put the proceeds into a parts fund
for the bus.

Good luck,
Eric
Maggie
