One is almost 1/8&quot; shorter than the others, with all 4 stuck in the 
block it shows up like a sore thumb. I checked all 8 that came with 
the spare engine (a 1.8) and they are all the same length. I checked 
BusDepot and they sell just one p/n for all the type 4 engines.
I guess they are all supposed to be the same length... I'll use one 
of the other ones and figure this one is just a manufacturing oddity.

Thank you for the response.
