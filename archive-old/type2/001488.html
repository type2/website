Someone asked:

&gt; Is it possible to import one of them to the USA?? Do imported trailers
&gt;  go thru the same strickt import regulations as vehicles??

I presume you won't have any problems getting them smogged :-) But then
again, I'm sure that 'the powers that be' can think of many reasons why they
are utterly unsafe and the American public must be protected against these
hazards. Well, life will kill you in the end.

However, as I wrote I had one (and sold it again) recently and found I still
have some picture on the web of the '86 Eriba in combination with my '69
Clipper (yes, the one from the book).

Here they are:
