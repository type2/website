I would like to add to steve's list.

The first step is to get a service manual and read it - preferrably the
Bentley. Get the Muir book too...

You'd be surprised how much stuff they cover in those things...

As todd &lt;vw_at_forceesc_dot_com&gt; said, the wiring diagrams are the solution to
this problem :-)

Joe, this is bad... there are a couple of possible causes.  The most
likely is that you have one or more clogged flex hoses.  These hoses run
from the metal lines on the frame to the wheel cylinders.  Over time (like
30 years :-), they absorb brake fluid and swell shut.  Once this has
happened, brake fluid can barely get to the wheel and once it does it
stays there.  The other likely cause is that you have a leaking wheel
cylinder.  The fluid that leaks out soaks your brake pads/shoes,
lubricates them and once they are lubed, they stop braking.  Actually, you
may have both going on at the same time :-(( One other thing that may be
happening is that one or more of your wheel bearings may be going bad.  I
doubt this, but it is possible.  VW wheel bearings go amazing distances
under awful maintainance conditions without failing.

Your next steps (after you stop driving!) are to:

remove all four wheels (two at a time), the drums in the rear, and inspect
the condition of your brake pads.  Given the price of pads/shoes, I
usually plan on replacing the pads/shoes no matter what.  That way I
*know* their condition!

look for leaks.  if any of the shoes/pads is wet with brake fluid, you
must replace not only the shoes/pads but that wheel cylinder/caliper and
the cylinder/caliper on the other side.

replace all flexible brake hoses, no matter what.


General rules on brakes, to the whole list (all of whom have heard it
before :-):

Brakes are the most important system on your bus!!!!  A bus that won't
run, won't kill you!  A bus that won't stop... very well might!!!  If you
even suspect your brakes are not functioning correctly, stop driving!!

Anything that you do to one wheel must be done to the other on the same
axle.  If you replace the right caliper, you must replace the left
caliper.  If you replace the left brake shoes, you must replace the right
brake shoes.

If the bus pulls left on braking, look for the problem in the right side
brakes, and vice versa.

Replace your flexible brake lines!!!!
