How should this be done? I was thinking of doing this to help protect the
undercarriage from rust/damage as on splitties.  I was thinking of doing it with
aluminum so as no to add to much weight what do you think? VW recommends attaching
armor with plastic screws ( see journey's under difficult condition VAG manual) any
thoughts on this?

&gt; 10.  Enclose the under carriage with sheet metal panels to reduce drag.
