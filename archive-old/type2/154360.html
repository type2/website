Subject: Loss in acceleration (particularly in 4th gear)

My son drives my 71 bus and noticed yesterday while driving down the freeway
that he was not able to maintain speed in 4th.  He dropped to 3rd and it
accelerated, but still not like it had before.  It was almost like it was
missing from time to time as well.  Turns out he had let the tank get really
low so I assumed we had gotten some sludge from the tank so I replaced the
fuel filter and checked for anything obvious, but nothing is turning up.

I need to replace the muffler, but that is about all.

Any ideas?

Thanks in advance for the responses...
