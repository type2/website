Subject: Electrical question

Hello, I was on this list long ago but now have recently gained a '76 camper bus.  I was looking under the bus and found an item mounted to the transmission that had 2 red wires from the starter and one to the harness connected to it.  Unfortunatly, it is cracked.  What is this thing so I can find a new one?.
   
  Thanks, Brian
