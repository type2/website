Subject: Re: [T2] VW front Emblem

&gt;&gt;73 Westy..
How is the emblem to be mounted and what size?
Mine is 10&quot; with one screw through the middle into the body
(one center hole only).
Should there be clips and more holes in the body for these clips?&lt;&lt;

Chris,

i can't answer your question regarding what size emblem is stock
for a 73, but i can help you with the mounting question for the
10&quot; emblem.

for the 10&quot; emblem i had on my 72 as well as the one i have now
on my 69 SC, they are mounted using 4 little plastic bits that
snap into the 4 mounting holes on the nose. so yes, there
should be 4 mounting holes for the 10&quot; emblem.

it could be that the 10&quot; emblem is not stock for your year
(someone help me out with that), or at one time maybe the nose
was repaired/replaced on your bus.

i got new emblem mounting bits from West Coast Metric. they 
weren't expensive.

also, as a side note, i have had great sucess using 'Eagle One
Aluminum/Chrome Polish' to shine up the chrome emblem.

sorry i can't answer your question in complete detail but i 
hope the limited info i supplied can help.

happy friday,

Joel Wilson
