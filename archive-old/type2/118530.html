Subject: RE: [T2] dizzy ground repair

I've tried, but never had luck with soldering those speaker wires...maybe
the factory has a special method. I don't know the details on TIG, but check
the archives, it was discussed here in the last couple years...

hmm
i dont think the flexing would crack the solder. it doesnt inside speakers
and woofers especially move a lot more than the dizzy plate.
can you tig weld copper to steel? is the plate steel? the nut?
