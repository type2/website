Subject: Re: More Bosch -- Alternator report, SoCal Imports report (very very	long)

(snipped a lot)
&gt;
&gt;So Southern California Imports sells a complete &quot;Alternator Conversion 
Kit&quot;
&gt;for $120 ($10 of which is core fee, why bother?).  This includes the 
stand /
&gt;alternator / strap / pulley / tin.  Given that I paid almost that much 
for a
&gt;38AMP Generator at a local VW FLAPS, and that didn't even include the
&gt;expensive 38AMP voltage regulator -- I contemplated the often repeated
&gt;advice on the VINTAGVW list -- go Alternator!

&gt;
&gt;Arrived as expected, actually very quickly (4 business days).  All was
&gt;there.  The Alternator is marked on the body by Bosch as NEW and the 
box
&gt;says NEW.  However, the metal case has a few smudges / dings that make 
it
&gt;look rebuilt -- but everything else on it looks pristine and untouched.
&gt;I'll just chalk that up as the Bosch factory not treating the case as
&gt;anything special and let it get a bit dinged before assembly.
&gt;
&gt;This is the AL82N -- which has an internal regulator.  ((You may have
&gt;noticed that the &quot;conversion kit&quot; parts didn't include a regulator, and 
I
&gt;noticed that it didn't list one either --- but I had a hunch this would 
work
&gt;out.  And it did.))  Wow, $120 for both the Alternator and the 
Regulator is
&gt;sounding like an even better deal.  Plus, less wires -- liking this!

&gt;BTW:  The Alternator is a lot lighter and simpler.  The regulator / AC 
to DC
&gt;converter is inside the unit and can be seen.  In general, it is very
&gt;apparent how the technology of Alternator is much more efficient.  The 
52
&gt;AMPS generated from a much smaller and lighter device (also half empty 
on
&gt;the inside, real clean and simple).

Hey Stephen and listees,
  I just did the same thing on my 70 Bus and it is a great thing. Make 
sure you get the internal regulated type, it's much simpler. It only has 
two wires to hook up. One (the blue) wire goes on the spade connector 
and the other is the big red one that goes to the battery. No fuss and 
no mess of wires, and 52amps to boot. I know that it was not stock on my 
70 bus, but I think its worth it, it looks like it belongs and only the 
type 2 nuts will know the differents. I van now run fog lights or 
driving lights with out fear. If you can afford it and are not a purist, 
I would do this convertion. And it can allways be returned to stock if 
needed.
