&gt; A radio BLOCK OFF plate!!
&gt; 
&gt; Then you could install your radio in your glove compartment..
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, BTW, I 'came across' a Vanagon radio block off plate two weeks ago, but
&gt; I don't have one for the bay...  And I would not need one since I have the
&gt; 'junk yard radio replacement' already installed.

There was a factory block off plate for vehicles that didn't even get the AM
radio. You would need to standoff the mounting behind the dash so the radio
could be inset deeper so the plate can be flush with the dash. If you have a
newer untit, there's not much spare behind there to begin with but I think
it can be done.
