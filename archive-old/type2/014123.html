Subject: Progressive carb pre-heat tricks????

Hi Folks,

I have installed the progressive on my new `77 westy
bus.  Seems to run great.  Still warm weather
here...planning ahead for colder weather. I have been
looking into some sort of carb pre heat for fall
months.

I know back in the `60s  several companies made things
for vws such as jet heaters...and heater ekement that
sat inside the venturi.  Probably dont make these any
more or do they?&gt;&gt;&gt; Also thought of running a
preheated air hose from under engine with a weighted
flap control ala early `65-67 buses.  Good idea vw
used it...I could fab that up easily.

I also know that some air planes have adjustable cab
pre-heat...been looking into what they use. Anybody
know?

Interested in folks sharing what they use and what
they have seen or found done.  After all is that is
what this list is for!  
Thanks guys!
