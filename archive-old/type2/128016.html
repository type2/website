Subject: Re: [T2] Things that go bump?

I'm afraid I don't have any to sell you, but as long as this thread is up... Does anyone in Middle/East Tennessee have a back bumper for a 1973? Not chrome, though. Pretty straight, if possible. Thanks.                      -Paul Deatherage

&gt; So, I need a set of front and back 68-72 bumpers,
