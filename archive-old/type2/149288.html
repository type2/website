Subject: Re: [T2] Wretched Running Bus

Hi Todd,

A fuel injected bus (the stock system in North America from 1975  
onwards) runs the fuel lines at 25-30PSI. If the lines get porous  
then it would quickly become a sprinkler system. A very HOT sprinkler  
system.


Happy trails,

&gt; The problem with my Bus was... the fuel lines were soo old that it  
&gt; was actually sucking in air through the fuel line. It WAS pulling  
&gt; fuel through the lines and delivering it to the carburetor, but the  
&gt; lines were so old that they became prous. It literally sucked air  
&gt; through the lines. It was never getting enough fuel and it would  
&gt; basically take me like 10 minutes of flooring it just to get to  
&gt; about 55 miles an hour.
