&gt; I'm a bit confused about how all the 71 oil cooler and all the associated

&gt; that was upright).

Nope, it is upright, just a bit more forward of the early cooler position.
The cooler adapter mounts to the engine and the doghouse cooler mounts to
the forward face of the adapter and extends upward.  The fan shoud lowers
over the whole works with the cooler now occupying the &quot;doghouse&quot; on the
front of the shroud.

The &quot;pancake&quot; engines used in the type 3
(squareback) had their coolers laying down and a different shroud
arrangement, as did the type 4 engines used on late buses and the 411/412.
