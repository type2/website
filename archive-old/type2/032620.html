Subject: Change the stats!

(Is anyone still keeping stats? I guess that shows how long I have
been on the list....)

I am the proud owner of a German model 1980 'Joker' (Vanagon Westy)
with the full trim package of 3 speed fridge, two burner stove, water, 
pop top with quality bed ('Never been slept in up top. Only folded out 3
or 4 times for luggage.') and full cold weather package (Larger battery,
Eberspacher, dual pane insulated rear windows). As a euro model, she is 
carburated and without emission controls.

Originally bought in Zurich, transported to the Canary Islands, then
to the US in '94 (waived by DOT), got a new motor from the factory
about 30,000 km ago, and then parked in VA Beach for the last
two years. 

She is very sound in the structural elements and the engine is 
tight and strong. But, like many cars that have lived by the ocean, she
is very rusty on the outside. There is also an exaust leak
somewhere either on the muffler or heat exchangers and the new gas tank was
installed without hooking up the gauge or overflow ports.

There is some work and a lot of learning for me in the near future, but
I already know that we will be going places together.
