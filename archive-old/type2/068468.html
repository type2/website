  I know - &quot;another tale from west, the guy never shuts up&quot;

 First liar don't stand a chance.

 I have no-one else to talk to.

 You really need to know this stuff.  Hah !!!

 Once upon a time there was this starry eyed little engineer . . . .

 &quot;We need a Snow-mixer for the South Pole, West, whip one up.&quot;

 Heres the conditions: it will sit outside at 70 below and will have
a 700 hp Murphy Diesel engine tied to hydraulic pumps and motors
that will drive two mixers that will mix down to 8 feet.

 Batteries don't work at that temperature, period.

 We won't get into any of the other trivial problems, just the starting /
charging system.

 Four of the biggest truck batteries known to man. 
Some of you may have seen them, couple hundred pounds apiece.

 This was no battery box, was a &quot;battery room&quot;.
Insulated and heated etc.

 24 volt starter system but 12 volt charging system.
Couldn't get 24 volt alternators.

 Using relays and so forth when you hit the starter position on the 
switch the batteries flipped into two sets in series for 24 volt.

 When it started and you let go of key dropping into &quot;run&quot;, all four
flipped into parallel and charged at 12 volts.

 I don't recall the amperages but the wiring was welding cables.

 Naturally the battery room is nowhere near the engine/starter.

 Had to get a variance from the military because I couldn't get it in
the right color for their spec's on such things.

 So if you have problems on those cold mornings in Montana, or the Alps,(I
love the international stuff) there are things we can do. :-)

 One note of caution: I had a problem of non-start one time and attributed
it to the battery so I got out the DC welder and hooked it
up. Tore the timing gears right out of that van engine.
 The oil was froze.
