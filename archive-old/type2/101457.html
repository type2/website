&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;I have a 72 van with what I believe to be a 1700 engine.
&gt;On my van it is missing the timing marks or the timing mark piece that bolts
&gt;to the outer crankcase.

The pulley should have a mark as depicted here:

A new timing scale can be bought from Bus Boys for &lt; $5.

Someone on the list once gave me some good advice and recommended that I paint the letters white so they are easier to read.

&gt;Can anyone offer any suggestions as to fing TDC withoout those marks?

On my distributor there is a very small notch on the rim (after you take off the cap) that will show you TDC for #1 when the rotor is aligned with the notch.
