Subject: RE: [T2] engine removal/supporting tranny

In the first and only engine pull ive done so far, I did not support the
tranny. It created for an interesting time when reinstalling the engine.
You kinda have to pull out a jack and jack the tranny up to get the
engine back in. As for it damaging the tranny not to support it, I
havent seen any evidance of that so far, but only time will tell.
