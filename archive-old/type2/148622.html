Subject: Re: [T2] KONI Group Buy Shocks now available again!

Hi,

I'm curious about this response. With adjustable shocks aren't you
basically mixing and matching a large set of different combinations?
When I change the settings on the Konis how is that different than
putting a new set of shocks on my ride with those properties? I would
think that the konis would be the ultimate in mixing and matching.

Does that make sense?

peace

from upgrading front vs. rear (e.g. comfort vs. braking) I don't recommend
it.
