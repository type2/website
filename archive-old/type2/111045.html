&gt;  Well, I took it out once again for a short trip to the bank.  Same issues. 
&gt;  When I returned, I noticed alot of condensation on the manifold under the 
&gt; carb.  Carb was also very cold, and seems like it may now have some sort of 
&gt; icing problem. 

The hot air runners (small tubes that come from muffler up to carb in
front of large runners. are what help the carb keep from icing over.
Are there any leaks in the runner? It could also be clogged. It's a
pain to get off since you have to remove several things just to get
the intake out. Depending on the conditions &amp; how long you let it run
you still might see some condensation. Mine does it now &amp; again. But
like daniel asked what shape is your exhaust system in? holes? good
connections? a leak in the hot air riser might cause some backfire
issues &amp; will definately make for a louder engine :( Unless you find a
leak I would investigate your theory about a clogged tank.
