Subject: Re: [T2] Gas Tank Removal

&gt; All I
&gt; could think of was when the GWB fell off the axle stands........



LOL!!! That comes back to haunt me every time I have ANY vehicle on
jackstands now...


The bad news, it broke off.  The good news, it was probably ready to go.
&gt;
&gt; So can this be repaired?  A new one braised on (probably do both for good
&gt; measure)  This work would not be done by me.  I would guess that this
&gt; would
&gt; need to be done before I do the POR treatment/ sealing.
&gt;


I thought they were screw on? The GWB's screwed in. I dunno about the return
line for fuel injection though. I haven't messed with the tank on the Guac
yet.
