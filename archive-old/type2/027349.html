Hello,

Been struggling trying to get my engine temps down for the
past week. Getting readings from my gauge past 245F!
Did a compression test and cyl #1 has 92psi
Putting oil in the cyl brings up the compression to 120psi
All other cylinders are above 120, #4 cyl is 140 ?!??
I just replaced the rings and had a valve job.
When I put the new rings in I took care to clean
the ring groves and install them right.
I have only put about 250 miles on the engine since
the new rings and I did the procedure to break in the
rings. You know going to 55mph then coasting to 20mph
leaving the trans in gear,did that a lot.

I also wondering if i have the correct spark plugs for
my engine.

It is a 79' 2L engine with a weber progressive
carb(32/36 dfav) setup.
I don't know what the PO did with the FI system.
When I have bought plugs I say I have a 79' engine
would it matter or not if it had a carb instead
the FI system? I noticed the Bently had different
part numbers for plugs on carbed and FI engines.
Could the wrong plug make me run a lot hotter?
So what plugs do I get?

As I said my engine is running a bit hot it seems
temps range around 245-250F on the highway at 60mph
I read somewhere that type4 engines run around 210-250F,
temps this high make me worried.
Also it was very hot this week 90+ temps if that makes a
big difference or not just thought i'd add that.

What I've checked
sealed the tin VERY well,
timing set spot on, same with dwell
valves are set 2 turns past contact(hydraulic lifters)
carb has no vacuum leaks(including brake booster line)
Gas mileage seems to be around 20-23, kind of high
compared to some of the specs in the type2 Average MPG page.
Spark plugs around dark black on the metal outer part
and white/brown on the insulator with the tip a bit white.
But then again I am not sure if there the right plugs.

I am thinking I should change the main jets on my carb.
Changing would hopefully make me run less lean, do
weber carbs usually run lean out of the box?
Anyone with a weber carb help me out here on what size
main jets to get?

Sorry for so many questions but I need to get up to
Michigan as soon as possible, my grandfather is in the
hospital. Kind of hoping to drive up

thanks in advance to any advice passed my way
