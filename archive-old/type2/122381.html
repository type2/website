&gt; Has anyone replaced their 'off side' passenger - right side battery tray in
&gt; a '72.  If yes, what did you use for a replacement, the bus depot / bus boys
&gt; battery tray [Battery Tray (Pass Side) 68-72 Bus] or the Just Kampers
&gt; battery tray [T2 Battery tray 7/71 &gt; 5/79 offside ]

I believe all the parts come from the same place. Passenger side with
battery clamp from VW, driver's side w/o from Klokkerholm. At least my parts
were.

I think BD has the dates wrong. The tail changed in 72 for the larger
taillights and it should probably read 72-79. ETKA bears this out.

&gt; The battery tray I got from  bus depot  have seems to be at least two inches
&gt; too wide for my '72.

Hmmm.
 
&gt; Hopefully the '72 battery tray is not a 'one year' items

Shouldn't be.
