&gt; I have a 73 Westy with a bad motor.  I have access to a 79 motor,

I paid $600 for a similar ('78 donor) setup in my '73.
The donor engine had 20K miles on it since a rebuild.
Today it has about 65K miles on it and runs good.

&gt; Q1:  Will the 79 motor bolt into a 73 van w/o any mods?

The '78 engine bolted up.  I think that it should fit under any
post '72 transporter.

&gt; Q2:  Should I install the 79 FI equipment in the 73?

Absolutely.  Especially if you have emissions tests in your area.

&gt; Q3:  Will the 73 dual carbs bolt onto the 79 motor?

I do not know.  You may need to re-jet the carbs as they were for
a 1.7L  The '79 engine is a 2.0L and needs a bit more fuel.

&gt; To do the FI swap I know I'll have to put in the new fuel pump, new fuel 
&gt; tank, the brain and the rest of the FI equipment. Am I missing 
&gt; anything???

As you remove parts from the '79 donor, put them on the '73 in a
similar location.  This worked well in my case.  I took the entire
'78 fuel and exhaust system.  Fuel tank, pump, ss fuel lines,
engine tin, exhaust and heater boxes, etc.

You will need to do some welding:
Bracket to hold the electric fuel pump.
Throttle cable guide tube moves from the left side to the center
of the engine bay.
Metal bracket to hold the air filter housing.

Cut a hole for the FI &quot;brain&quot; near the battery.

Transplant the &quot;firewall&quot; into the '73.  It has a bracket welded to
it for a FI chingadero (decelleration valve?).  There are also some
FI parts mounted on the left side (double relay and resistor pack).

I kept the '73 trans, bell housing, clutch and starter. The '78
flywheel did not match up to the '73 starter (my only folly) so I had
to take it all apart and swap flywheels.  Save yourself some trouble
from my mistake and put the '73 flywheel on the donor engine straight
away.

Good luck,
