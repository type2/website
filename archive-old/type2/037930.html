Subject: 68 crew questions answered...thanks

Thanks to all who contributed to my questions on 68 double cabs and front disc conversions. I traveled a few hours today and checked out the crew in question and unfortunately the coastal fog beat me to it. It's fairly straight and looked like just surface rust from the pics, but, when I pushed my thumb through the undercarriage, it became to me more of a project than I can tackle. 

Very nice crew for parts though, and the price reflects the obvious problems....$950 obo   anyone interested can contact the owner in Fairfield,CA
