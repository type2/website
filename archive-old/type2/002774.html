Saw the movie Blow the other night with Johhny Depp. Started out in the mid
sixties with a drug dealer selling pot in California. He drove a nice 70's
bus. The only problem was that the film was supposed to be taking place in
1969. I guess their researchers didn't expect many bus people to be in the
audiance or something. I was probably the only one in the theatre who
noticed ( or cared.. LOL)
