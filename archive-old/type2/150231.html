Subject: Solar Battery Charger

Hi everyone,



I am sad to say that Louise has been put into an ancillary vehicle role
as of late because of longer distance commutes. I plan to use Louise as
my primary vehicle again soon. Anyways, currently Louise sits about two
weeks between uses for camping. During this time, my battery goes bye
bye. A jumpstart and she is good to go. It is annoying jumping my bus,
and I get looks from the neighbors. On that auction site, they have two
types of solar battery chargers. One plugs into the cigarette lighter
and one has clips that go onto the battery leads. Does anyone have
experience with the cigarette lighter version? It seems very convenient,
I am just not sure our dealer-installed cigarette lighters can handle
that. If the battery leads version is the best option, does anyone have
experience hiding the wires or does one just slide the wires through the
cooling vents on the back of the bus? All opinions/science welcome.



Thanks,



Max Bronsema
