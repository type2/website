 &gt;	I really understand your need for an air conditioning unit. If we
had that
&gt;kind of temperatures here for a few days it would probably be called a
&gt;nature catastroph.

&gt;However, wouldn't the noise be a problem on a campground unless you are
&gt;alone on the whole place?

&gt; Please don't do this to your camping neigbours. Find another solution. I
&gt;would love to help you but my experience with aircondition units is wery
&gt;limited.

I know this isn't Friday, but I need to respond to this.

At last year's Busses By the Arch in St. Louis Mo, the temperature must
have been around 85 to 90 at night with humidity at about the same.  At
night in those conditions, people either use a small window AC unit (such
as the Texas group had), or lay awake wishing they had.  There are those
hardy souls (usually younger) that can stand the temperatures, or have had
too much liquid refreshment and could sleep anywhere.  But I even heard a
few younger people from hot climates who complained about the heat and
humidity!!

Don't get me wrong, I love the quiet of the out of doors, that's why I live
on a farm away from anyone else.  And if the temperature is nice, I would
much rather have my window open.

And I would love to camp in Finland where I can leave the AC at home!!
