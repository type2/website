Darrin:
    The rapid clicking sound you heard with the key on &quot;on&quot; was more than
likely an electric fuel pump. If you crawl under the bus and search for the
noise you will probably find a little metal box with a couple of fuel lines
attached (or perhaps a confused woodpecker). I have replaced the little
kickboards in front with mahogany door skins (I've seen others on the list
who have done similar things with various types of wood), they are cheap,
look great and can be cut easily with a sharp utility knife. My bus' PO used
fabric adhered to his old kickboards with contact cement that looked ok,
too. That is the extent of my knowledge. If you have a Bentley manual it
should tell you what switch is which (if you don't you should get one they
are an invaluable resource).
Hope this helps,

&gt; Hello All,
&gt;
&gt; First, I'd like to say thanks for all of the help that I've already
received
&gt; from the people on this list.  Thank you very much.  Assistance from this
&gt; news group has already enable me to do more mechanically to my bus than I
&gt; ever thought I was capable of doing.  Thanks.
&gt;
&gt; The wife and I went camping this weekend.  However, it didn't just rain,
but
&gt; poured almost all weekend long.  So, I had a lot of time inside my bus to
&gt; ponder.
&gt;
&gt; 1)  On the dash, the switches go Headlights; Dome Light; Hazard, Defrost,
&gt; ?????.  What is the final switch supposed to be?   It is wired, but the
wire
&gt; dissappears into a bundle.
&gt;
&gt; 2)  I was looking at my roughed up kickboards and thinking about the
$80.00
&gt; to replace them and wondered if anyone has had any luck replacing them
with
&gt; thin plywood painted or covered with some kind of upholstery.
&gt;
&gt; 3)  After a lot of time in the bus using lights, radio, sink, etc.. just
&gt; curious if anyone has any tips on how to install a deep cycle marine
&gt; battery.  Are there any problems associated with this?
&gt;
&gt; 4)  For some reason, the previous owner cut a huge hole in the rear engine
&gt; tin.  I'd like to buy and install new tin (black).  However, I have the
&gt; pancake engine (No Doghouse Cooler) and all the advertisements I see are
for
&gt; the Doghouse Cooler.  Help would be much appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; 5) Does anyone know of replacement seats that can be installed on the bus?
&gt; The first 450 miles were ok, but after that the spring was just killing
me.
&gt;
&gt; 6) I'm missing one of the handles needed to open the louvered windows.
I've
&gt; checked all of the local junk yards and web-sites I could find, but no
luck.
&gt; Anyone know where I may be able to find one?
&gt;
&gt; 7) When I turn my key one click (Not engaging the starter) to listen to
the
&gt; radio, I hear a rapid clicking sounds from the engine compartment.  I have
&gt; no clue what this sound is, nor if it is bad.  Please help!
&gt;
&gt; I apologize for the length and all of the questions, but I'd appreciate
your
&gt; help in assisting me working off my honey-do list!
&gt;
&gt; Sincrely,
&gt;
