Subject: running engine with alternator disconnected (did I screw up?)

In my happiness and zeal about converting my 74 single cab to Fuel Injection and happily ranting how wonderful it is to have it running on the garage floor instead of in the truck, I've been struck with a thought that somehow I may have ruined the alternator by not having it connected to the battery while it's running.  It seems I read somewhere that this would be the case.  Does anyone have any experience with this?  While the engine's still out would be a good time to replace the alternator if needed.  Thanks!  Greg T.
