Subject: Westy bed won't lay completely flat

A question for you westy people out there.  re: my 71 Westy's folding bed.

Have you ever come across the problem where the westy bed doesn't quite
fold all the way out?   When I fold out the bed, it almost folds flat,
but not quite.  Unfortunately, that remaining angle is just enough to be
annoying, especially because it tends to rock on the pivot rather than
being a nice stable platform.

Is it difficult to remove the bed and folding mechanism?  Any tips on what
to look for? 
Greg
