Subject: Re: [T2] Side marker lens seal

&gt;Interesting idea.  Have you ever tried the &quot;cut it out&quot; method on this 
particular &gt;seal?  I'd be interested to know if it worked.  And I'd be 
interested to know exactly &gt;what you used.

&gt;The big problem with this seal, as I see it, is that it wraps around the 
edge of the &gt;bulb holder.  I don't have either the experience or the 
imagination to understand &gt;how you can replicate that by cutting the seal 
from stock.  Any tips?



Magical Mike,
I just ran out in the rain and pulled off the front reflector which should 
have the same seal.
I see the seal is molded to fit around the backing plate.
If you remove the seal from the backing plate and used it as a template on a 
thin piece (1/16&quot;?) of closed cell foam fabric harvested from an old &quot;spring 
suit&quot; wet suit or from an industrial supplier (Granger?) you could make 2 
oversized gaskets per lens, allow for more contact surface between the 2 
seals which you will sandwich the backing plate in between.
(There is room for a wider oversized seal.)
You could pre glue them at the outside seams or use a gasket adhesive between 
them as you reassemble the parts.
The closed cell foam will compress &amp; conform to the lens and backing plate 
ect.
The seals don't show and the main function is to keep moisture out.
I have not tied this for this particular application but have made similar 
applications for other projects, it makes sense to me.
How's that sound?

Rusty
