Subject: Re: [T2] Jake Raby motor reviews ?

Sorry I didn't jump into this dance a little earlier,
but I was indisposed. I've probably driven a greater
variety of Jake's motors than most people, including
some of the Type 1's, particularly a stock 1500 SP in
a Karmann Ghia, a 1600 DP in a Super Beetle, the 1776
from the Super Beetle that Sean Harris mentioned
previously, and a good friend of mine has a 1678 DP in
his 1970 Bus that I drive frequently. I'm very
familiar with his materials and methods, and the
answer for him is: only the best parts, checked for
accuracy, and put together in the best environment.
I've also driven a number of the different T4
applications, and am going to have Jake build a
Massive Type IV for me next year, but since this
e-mail specifically talks about Type 1's, let me talk
to those particular engines:

1500 SP - Good, low-end power, nice wide powerband,
especially for a smaller-displacement single-port. I
don't quite know how to explain this, but it felt
solid and tight, and ran perfectly. 

1600 DP - This was a motor that Jake had built a
number of years previously and was purchased as a used
motor by a friend of mine. I'm not sure what sort of
mileage was on this motor, but it still ran
beautifully and pulled well - a good, smooth-running
machine.

1678 DP - I drive this bus fairly regularly, as it
belongs to a good friend of mine. The torque on this
thing is amazing! We recently took it on a several
hundred mile cruise through the North Georgia and
Southern North Carolina mountains, and it conquered
the hills without a problem - most of the time we
never had to get out of 3rd gear. That, and it will
still manage 75 mph on the highway. I'm building a
similar one for my bus, designed more for top-end than
torque, with Jake's guidance, and parts that I've
sourced from him. 

1776 DP - This was an interesting experience, because
I got to ride in this car three different times - once
when it had a badly-built 1835cc built by someone
else, then again with the 1776cc built by Jake with
Kadron carbs. The 1835cc seemed... ok. It had more
power than a stocker, but it didn't seem to fulfill
the promise of all that displacement. Then, after Sean
had the 1776cc put in it, the difference was night and
day. The Jake-built 1776cc outgunned the 1835 by a
long shot. Sean took me for a ride in this car, and
even with the restrictive nature of the Kadrons, it
still hauled some major ass. 

Anyway, I would recommend a Jake-built engine to
anyone, anytime, anywhere, and I'll soon have one of
my very own.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I would be interested to hear from anyone that has
&gt; purchased a type 1 
&gt; motor from Jake Raby at 
&gt; http://www.aircooledtechnology_dot_com/Home_Page.htm . 
&gt; I am in shopping 
&gt; for an engine builder and am intrigued by Jake's
&gt; take on building 
&gt; motors. Jake took the time out the answer a lot of
&gt; sophomoric 
&gt; questions from me which I appreciate!!!!!! Since I
&gt; do not currently 
&gt; know anyone that has purchased a motor from  him I
&gt; was hoping there 
&gt; would be a few listmembers out there that have who
&gt; could share there 
&gt; experiences with me.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Chris
