Subject: Silicone wiper blades

&gt;1 wiper blades replacement/year				 10

This reminded me of something I wanted to mention to the list.  For those
not interested in perfect restoration, there is a pretty wide variety of
wiper blades to choose from.  There is a type of blade made of pure silicone
and it's supposed to last forever.  I don't doubt that the ones I put on my
F**d T**r*s will...

...but over a few months of use they leave a film of silicone on the
windshield.  That film has the water-repellent properties of Rain-X
windshield treatment.  Some swear by Rain-X, others swear at it.  If you are
one of the latter, DO NOT purchase lifetime-whiz-bang silicone wipers, else
you will give your windshield a Rain-X type treatment.  That film doesn't
come off easily...if at all...
