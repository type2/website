Was someone looking for the water drip tray for a 68-73 behind-the-pass seat
sink/cooler? I found a good one today in a 70 hardtop Westy.

Also found a 69 poptop Westy and took the luggage net assembly from the top
rear. Anyone need it?
Anyone need any parts from these? They are sitting in a self-serve yard in
Fresno, Calif.
