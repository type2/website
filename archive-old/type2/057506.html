Subject: trip report

Took the Riviera this past weekend on its first road trip since I bought it
last month, from Lawrence, Kansas, to a private lake at 8200 feet in Pike
National Forest, Colorado. Went pretty well, all things considered. A few
times in the mountains I wasn't the slowest thing on the road, and I even
passed three passenger cars on the trip, one of them *uphill*.

The rebuilt pancake 2000 performed well -- got hot but never quit. I was
able to cruise comfortably at 65 with spurts to 70 and up when needed (or
inattentive). It's losing oil somehow, though, possibly through the oil
breather, which has a hose connection that's not connected to anything since
the PO replaced the FI with the carb system. Gonna have that dealt with real
soon. Also had a couple of breakdowns.

Aug. 11 -- Leave Lawrence, gassed up and feeling good. Get off the
Interstate at Junction City to take some two-lane roads. 

Stop for gas in Lucas, site of the famous Garden of Eden, a must-see if
you're within 50 miles or so, and see that I forgot to replace the gas cap
when I filled up. (Turns out that the gas in Lucas was the worst of the trip
too. I'm not stopping at the Conoco on the east side of town ever again.) Of
course, no gas caps for a '77 bus in Lucas, or any of the towns between
there and Denver. I resolve to *hold* the gas cap while filling from now on.
(Remembering an earlier incident with my Geo Metro, I make the same
resolution about the oil filler cap.)

No gas cap at the Wal-Marts in Colby or Goodland and no way to even find out
what the model number is on the one I need. It's after 6 p.m. so the parts
stores in town are closed.

Aug. 12 -- Get a gas cap in Denver. Happy camper. Head for mountains. Bus
handles the hills fairly well.

Aug. 16 -- Get going pretty late. Get as far as Colorado-Kansas line before
finding a rest area and crawling in back to sleep. (I love my campmobile.)

Aug. 17 -- Stop in Goodland for gas. As I start to pull out, a buzzer's
going off and not stopping. It did that at the mechanic's last week and he
thought he fixed it. I crawl around under the dash until I figure out the
buzzer's plugged into the fuse box; I think it's the
door-open-key-in-ignition warning thing and it's forgotten what its job is.
Anyway, I pull it out and the noise goes away. (I also pull out a different
thingie by mistake and might have put it back wrong -- now the turn signals
don't flash. I'll play with that today.)

So I go back to check the oil, and the fan belt's come off. It seems intact,
so I try to put it back on and tighten it. The alternator won't hold still,
though; it's actually wiggling around a little. The lower pivot bolt has
come loose, too. Hmm. I can't find my ratchet handle so I walk to
Wallyworld; they don't have a 1/2-inch handle. Fume. (Actually the main
customer service guy helpfully pulls a handle out of a tool kit and sells it
to me, so leave relatively satisfied.) I get back and promptly find the
original handle where it had fallen behind something. Growf.

After a while it's clear this is beyond my ability to fix, so I call around.
Lonnie from West Side Car Service, a one-person operation, comes out in his
tow truck, pulls the bus in, and notices out that the alternator bracket has
broken off the exhaust pipe it was attached to. He spot-welds it and we
manage to get the bolts back in place. Then he charges me less than half
what I was expecting to pay. If you get a chance, stop in and say hi, and
tell him I sent you.

I head for Colby and breakfast at noon (this has all taken several hours).
Just before blowing town I check the engine. The fan belt's off and
shredded. Growf. Luckily there's a spare (and lots of other stuff; the PO
never threw anything away). I wrestle it on, tighten it (it works this time)
and hit the road; twice before reaching the freeway I get paranoid about
noises and stop to double-check the belt. It stays on.

An hour or so later I stop at a rest area for another nap. Then the engine
doesn't start; clicking but no turning. There's *no* phone at this rest
area, so I may really be stuck. Get out the Idiot book, go through it in
order. Hmmm. The battery has juice. Starter not stuck to flywheel. No
shorts. Put screwdriver across the solenoid terminals; nope. I've been on
the hot, fresh asphalt for an hour when a nice fellow from Michigan comes
up; he used to have a bus, etc. etc. I say I'm about to the point where you
whack on the starter, and he offers to turn the key while I do it. Vrooom.

(I'm surprised, not that that was the problem, but that that works at all --
I mean, you're not supposed to be able to get a *car* started by hitting it
on the side. I resolve to try that method with other things that don't do
what they should, such as the toaster, the computer, and the apartment
maintenance guy.)

Anyway, the bus made it back the rest of the way with no problem. Got hot
back there, but did OK.

1300 miles on the button. 15.1 mpg.

Must-see: Garden of Eden in Lucas, Kansas, on K-18 northwest of Salina, not
far north of I-70. The creation of the local eccentric, who built dozens of
concrete and limestone figures in his yard, mostly religious and political
allegories. He himself is lying in a mausoleum he built for himself and his
wife in one corner of the yard. Definitely worth a guided tour.

Also in those parts, check out the post rock -- limestone that, when drilled
and broken properly, makes good strong fence posts in the absence of trees.
Also mailbox stands, signposts, and yard decorations of various kinds. It's
all over the place; you can even see a lot of it from the Interstate.
