Subject: Re: [T2] hotsoak

&gt;I tend to park in the shade whenever I can and avoid driving in the midday 
&gt;summer heat but the engine temps really go up after stopping especially if 
&gt;you've been stuck in traffic prior for 10 minutes. I also read in the 
&gt;Probst FI book that hoatsoak is really good at clogging the fuel injectors.
&gt;
&gt;Now that the hotsoak season is upon us, do people have any tricks for 
&gt;dealing with this?
&gt;
&gt;I was thinking how watercooled vehicles run a thermostatically controlled 
&gt;fan even after the engine has been turned off but the old aircooled 
&gt;engines has no such feature.
&gt;
&gt;After that long discussion on supplementary cooling fans that aren't 
&gt;practical for all the obvious reasons (battery consumption, cooling 
&gt;efficiency) would circulating air in the engine compartment have any 
&gt;effect against the hoatsoak?

The best way I can think of would be to use a watercooled engine fan to 
blow through modified tin on the top of the engine. Tin would look 
something like a Corvair shroud and have louvers that closed when the 
engine was running so the OEM fan would do the work.

You could run Corvair style shrouds and add a motor to drive the fan for a 
few minutes when the engine was off.

Idle the engine for a few extra minutes - as I understand it per Mackerle's 
book on aircooled engines the temps go up initially but will begin to fall 
on a &quot;modern&quot; air cooled engine idling on a hot day.
