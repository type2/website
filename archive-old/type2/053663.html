Subject: sagging rear info

So I was perusing my digests and i see there is some controversy about
adjusting the rear torsion bars. I also follow a link to Sami Dakhlia's 911
engine conversion (another bizarre and perverted fantasy of mine, flat 6
and 5-speed, no offense Sami) and on that site I found this page,
apparently from a VW manual

http://www.simplecom_dot_net/dakhlia/images/VW-42.7.jpg

Looks to me like VW itself is saying the torsion bars need to be adjusted.
At the very bottom it says &quot;On high mileage vehicles always adjust both
bars because the bars tend to settle with use&quot;

I want to add that Sami's site is far better then what I have to offer as
he has most of the documentation I can offer. He is also much better at
scanning then I am. I guess a lower res jpeg is better then a high res gif
since his image files are smaller and look better then mine. You know what
they say &quot;Photoshop and a Mac does not an artist make&quot; or something like
that.
