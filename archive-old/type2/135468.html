I'm referring to the ones in our vehicles in the T2 list. Yes Kettering.

That being said, I'll still put a wager for lunch that the 79-83 factory one
is a joke to a Mallory. I ran a garage for almost 20 years, worked on them
all (including the ones you are referring to), NO CONTEST.

I'm not saying anyone &quot;needs&quot; it, but the bosch distributors (all of them;
all is all) in the VW T-2s are not even close to &quot;accurate&quot;. They do work,
but that depends on your definition of &quot;work&quot;. 009s also &quot;work&quot; for most VW
owners.

&gt;  Most people do not realize how inaccurate the bosch units are. They
assume
&gt; their timing light is &quot;supposed&quot; to scatter as much as it does. Only after
&gt; timing a Mallory do you realize it's not your timing light that's causing
&gt; the erratic spark scatter, its your engine! Many people think their
ignition
&gt; system &quot;is perfect&quot; even after putting a light on it. The clarity of the
&gt; timing marks when triggerring off a Unilite usually eliminates the &quot;is
&gt; perfect&quot; comments.

&gt; Whoa..... you cannot lump all Bosch distributors in your &quot;Mallory is
better than all&quot;
&gt; synopsis.  Unless you are familiar with the 79-83 factory electronic
distributors, which I
&gt; doubt, then you need to just refer to the Kettering style Bosch
distributors.
