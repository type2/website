&gt;Is this the cooler looking type? Coleman makes one of these for
around
&gt;$75 that will cool your stuff (45 degrees below outside temp)
and also
&gt;heat it too. It is ac/dc too. I was thinking of buying one...
Has any
&gt;bought one of these?
&gt;
&gt;RJ.
&gt;

I was actually thinking of trying to install the cooling units of
one of those into my lift lid cooler.
I hate having bulky things cluttering up my bus like an extra
cooler.

Peace
Thom
