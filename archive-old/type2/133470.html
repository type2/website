&gt; I got the hitch back from the welder yesterday.  It looks great.  The hardest part of the installation was threading the M 10 (1.5)
&gt; bolts into the 33 years of crud in the threads if the holes in the frame. It fit perfect.  I also relocated my oil filter to a
&gt; higher spot.  Here's the pictures.  BOTC (tent trailer in tow) here I come!

nice looking,  hope your gonna be able to get that muffler a little
further from the road.

looking forward to taking a good look at it at John Browns Buses
