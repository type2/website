&gt; &gt;&gt;Guys,
&gt; &gt;&gt;I want to replace my *ordinary* ignition with an electronic one...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I think the good dokter...has a real good point...maybe you missed
it.......
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Let's see. How many sets of points can we get for $300????????????
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Stock system..in good tune...no need to change....
&gt; I dunno..you do the math....
&gt; how many points/ign parts can u buy for $300 +  dollars..
&gt;
&gt; more that you'll ever need for the life of your motor....

I would look at it this way:

Never have to replace points again.
Coil always puts out maximum voltage. As the points get dirty, they lower
primary voltage. When primary voltage drops, so does secondary output.

I have been using a Cal Vanagon electronic ignition in my 77 Westy for the
past 55,000 miles and it has been 100% troublefree. This system does not use
any friction or a rubbing block. Nothing to wear out in the distributor. I
have been putting together the pieces to make this setup [all original VW
parts available just about anywhere] and they run around $60-$70 when I can
find them at the wrecking yards. Thats a distributor, coil, ign. module, and
a harness connecting the 3.

I dunno.. you do the math....
how many times do you want to replace points in the middle of a road on a
cold, rainy night?
