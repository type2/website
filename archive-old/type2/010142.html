&gt;
&gt;Here's the question. Do I have to determine what the displacement for
&gt;the engine is before I set the timing (as the timing for an ED is
&gt;different than the timing for the 2L GD engine) or if the engine number
&gt;is ED, I use the ED numbers?
&gt;

I would time it according to the distributor I had.
A ED distributor is a dual vacuum unit that times at 5 after.
A GD distributor is a single vac. unit that times at 7.5 before.
Which dist. do YOU have?
If you time the dual unit correctly at 5 after with the engine at idle and 
both vacuum hoses connected.... you would find that when you disconnected 
the retard hose, you would be at 7.5 before. Same as the single unit GD 
dist.
