&gt; Will upgrading the ignition in a 2.0L with CDI and and aftermarket 
&gt; dizzy like a Mallory improve emissions? If so, will it improve emission 
&gt; substantially?
&gt; 

Hello Mark??       I would think that it would mainly because it will burn 
better due to the hotter spark  how much I dont know. We dont have emission 
testing here . Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
