Subject: Re: [T2] CB Radio Antenna install

A general rule of thumb for CB is that the antenna should be:

a) Longer than 40&quot;
b) mounted on a good ground
c) the tallest thing on you vehicle.

with a pop-top you have a whole bunch of challenges to deal with.  For my Ham radios, I have the antennas mounted to the rear load-bar on my Thule rack.  The rack is mounted to the gutters using their hi-lift risers.  I have also run a seperate ground wire from the body under the luggage rack to the antenna bases.

The other solution is to find a 1/2 wave antenna (sometimes sold as a &quot;no-ground plane&quot; or &quot;marine&quot; antenna) and mount that to the gutter.

Avoid folding mounts, or anything overly clever.  A CB has very little output power, and any &quot;clever tricks&quot; in the antenna mount could cost you some serious range.

Good Luck!

&gt; &gt; Anyway - so - will this antenna work properly - or optimally - I kinda doubt
&gt; &gt; it but ... if not what should I do ... get a longer antenna that goes about
&gt; &gt; my pop-top? ... if so how high should it go ... 6&quot; or 3' or what?
