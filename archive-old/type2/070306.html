&gt;The '79-'83.5 heads didn't have the copper gaskets.  Neither do the

&gt;that out?  Anyone?

As far as I know, all engines from 72 thru 78 had identical, rounded
exhaust ports and came with the copper gaskets.  I have always received
them in gasket sets for my '73, and always installed them.  True, they can
be difficult to install, but I am usually able to do it on the first try by
smearing some anti-sieze (why anti-sieze?  because it's the right
consistancy) on the gasket and sticking it to the top of the exhaust pipe,
then gently raising up the heater box, keeping it level.  Never failed me
yet.
