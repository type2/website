Subject: Absolutely no bus/vanagon content: Oil Recipe?

This is WAY off topic and it isn't Friday so I'll probably get sent to
list limbo but...

A couple of months ago when the urban legend Neiman-Marcus Cookie Recipe
was floating around, someone did a great parody with an oil recipe.
Does anyone have a copy that they could forward me?

TIA
