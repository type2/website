&gt; Sorry Rob but I don't see any easy way out for you.  You are=20
&gt; going to have=20
&gt; to spend either lots of time OR lots of money to get your bus=20
&gt; back on the=20
&gt; road reliably.

Yeah, so I'm finding out, but in a way I'm looking forward
to it, as it's a great opportunity to learn this engine
inside and out.  I like your idea about putting the rods, crank
etc from the vanagon into the bay's case, I may try that.  The
vanagon engine only has 67K miles on it.  Will the pistons and
cylinders interchange as well?  If so, then all I really need
is some rebuilt heads right? (as far as major expense is concerned.)

If I find that my bay's case is bad (hopefully not), I have 2=20
1700s, will one of those work?

I hope to have some pics of my head and piston up after the weekend,
hittin' the road tomorrow to go see my vanagon and strip some parts. =
Funny
how things work out,  14 months ago I had never owned a type 4 engine, =
now
I have 4.  I think my type I is getting jealous.

Rob
