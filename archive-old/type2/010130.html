Dear volks-
	The other day I saw a 69 bus like mine with a RV a/c unit on the roof. 
I have been debating getting one for my 69.  Does anybody have any
comments on doing such a thing.  Can the roof handle the weight of the
unit.  Since this bus is not a camper there are no added supports on the
roof.  And since the roof has to be cut will this hurt the roofs
structure?  Will the a/c keep the roof solid? How dificult is it to do? 
Can it be done?  I called a local RV place here in New Mexico and they
sell everything I need for $650.  That seems reasonable since a ICE unit
costs over $1000 and it is run by the engine (possible overheating). 
This is run by a the battery it will not strain my engine.

Any thoughts

Thanks in advance.

Chuck
