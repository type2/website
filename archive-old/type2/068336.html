There's a bus on Hwy 421, 20 miles east of Huntsville, AR that has a high
metal top in back. It's a post-71 from the tail lights. Been sitting there
for 2 or 3 years at least. I stopped one day, but I wasn't impressed. Don't
know what a Devon's like, but I always figured this one was just a home-made
top...even though the top looks &quot;professionally&quot; done. (I just can't imagine
someone adding more metal to the back of a bus. Doesn't make sense.)
