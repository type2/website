&gt; The original floor consisted of a few hardwood blocks,about 2x3x1/2&quot;
&gt; in the low spots of the steel floor.  Then a sheet of 1/4&quot; masonite
&gt; followed by 1/2&quot; plywood.  Grey linoleum with a pebble finish on
&gt; top of all that.  The wooden 'furniture' holds the floor down.

Ditto that on the '68 and '71 westies I've disassembled, though actually
on mine the thinner layer was on top, just under the linoleum.  There's
also a trim strip along the sliding door edge, very much like the edge
trim you can get for vinyl flooring or carpet where it meets e.g. a wood
floor.

On the ones I've seen, the blocks Jack mentions are mostly under the
rear seat to level it out, since the lower plywood layer doesn't extend
that far back.

Anyone had any luck with a close-to-original vinyl floor covering in
that pebble-grain grey/white design?
