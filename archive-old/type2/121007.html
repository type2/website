Subject: Re:NY campmoblie for sale (what to check)

Re $500 76 NY camper for sale-how manyh miles on body/trans?
Is it the one with a full bed in the back or 3/4 bed with side cabinet? 
The former is rarer.   Regarding biting off more you can chew, we had a
75 van that sat for 6 years- had to spend a fair amount on new brake
lines, bearings,  FI gummed up parts, tank gummed up......much better if
it has been running up to when you get it.  IE, is it running OK? 
Compression done in your presence?  Them it is worth it alone ($500)
just for the engine and trans!  For a NY bus, how is the body rust? 
Check the front wheel well carefully above and around the large
&quot;dimple&quot;, checking under peeling undercoating- pulling out the inside
mat inside behind it to check there- is it rusted into the rocker cavity
or along that body wall above the dimple?   Poke with a screwdriver
around the end housings that hold the torsion tubes in front- see any
rust-through?  Any sagging of the floor where the sliding door bottom
roller rides (rust of the rocker box spread to that area?).... How much
rust bubbling is around the seat belt mounts, looking INSIDE the bus
where the belt mount bolt fastens?  This includes the rear belts.  If
you can, remove the 2 screws holding the front kick panels in place and
pull out at least one (pass side easier) and then look down to the
bottom- this is an area that can rust through due to water collecting
from leaky windshield.  Look carefully under windshield seal and rear
window seals hidden by the knockout panels, especially under rear driver
side pivot window- BTW, is the pivot window even openable?  Open rear
hatch and look for evidence of water leaking in via top seal or glass
seal-ie, mat may be soaked/moldy, or rust around door latch.  Open roof
bed- any signs of mice nests  (speaking of which, they like the cavity
behind kick panel in front, another reason you get rust out there, and
inside the door bottoms, inside the rear hollow body brace under the
engine hatch, and behind the inside dish/sink cabinet- all great places
to start rust from mouse pee! Also the heat tube cavities can be blocked
with nests....AArrgh, don't get me started re mice......the mothballed
camper is FULL of fabric softener sheets now   (*
