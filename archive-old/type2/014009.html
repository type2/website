Subject: Re: [VB] First time non-greeting from ACVW

John,
 Did you actually wave, or did you flash a peace sign?
Do you have a peace sign painted on your bus or maybe
flowers painted around your headlights? Any and all of
that will most likely make me turn my head and act
like I didn't see you when I am on the road.
 Mike

&gt; people who do... Oh my God, I'm not a freak am
&gt; I!?!?!?  Wait a minute, don't answer that last
&gt; question....
