Subject: Driveshaft removal or today's futile gesture

Hey y'all
It being really nice when I got home I thought I'd pull the driveshafts
and get ready to install the CV kits.  There's 24 Allen headed bolts
holding them in place, with a 6mm head.  Got 21 of the 24.  What
happened?  Simple.  I got cocky when the 1st came off the right side of
the tranny with no complaint.  It was just past finger tight.  Tried the
next one, same thing.  Tried the next one - strip!  I said some unkind
words and tried the next one, again just past finger tight.  I felt so
good about the just past finger tights I went ahead and stripped the
remaining 2.

I said more unkind words, then got out the Kroil and gave the remaining
unstripped bolts a good cleaning and soaking (shoulda done that first
huh?).  Tap the allen wrench in the remaining bolts, tap some more to
gently break them loose and they all came out sweeter than maple taffy
fresh from the boiler and poured on new snow.

So I now have 1 driveshaft on the ground and another with 3 stripped
allen head bolts on the right side of the tranny.  I soaked 'em all real
good with Kroil and tapped a bit to loosen things up.  The closest
larger American size doesn't quite fit in the stripped metrics, the next
bigger metric don't fit.  I tried cutting a groove in the head of 1 of
the offending bolts and tried the impact driver but that didn't work
either, and so called it a day before I broke something else.

Any suggestions from the list regarding the removal of reluctant
stripped allen head bolts?

Dave
