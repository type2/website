Please confirm with Greg Potts (greg_at_pottsfamily_dot_ca) or Collison
(collie_at_ifoundit_dot_ca), but I believe the Canadian Contingent will be on CH
14. They are leaving tonight at 8 p.m. so you may want to check sooner
rather than later.

&gt; Anybody have a list of the CB channels that the various carabusses will be
using?

The FMBC usually uses cb channel 2 for type 2..
