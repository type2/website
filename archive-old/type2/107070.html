Subject: Re: [T2] dizzy hole isn't deep enough

It sounds like the distributor drive has moved away from the cam gear and
needs to be reset.

Subject: [T2] dizzy hole isn't deep enough


&gt; got an engine that had about 80 K on it and done a
&gt; little work to the outside but didn't crack the case
&gt; or anything.  Went to put in the distributor but the
&gt; hole isn't nearly deep enough.  can i just push the
&gt; metal piece further into the hole? and has the angle
&gt; of the notch now become misaligned with the engine?
