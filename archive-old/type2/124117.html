Subject: RE: [T2] Mild Backfires. 

I should say the exhuast valves are at risk if the exhuast leak is AT
the attachment point to the heads. You are saying it's at muffler,
bascially just annoying as the exhuast mixture leans out.




On decleration=mild to moderate exhaust leaks, and the conditions of
gasketlessness you describe indicate that. You also run the risk of
burning exhuast valves.

I rev the engine and on the way back down in RPM's it kinda
sputter/backfires. Also kinda does it on too fast of revving. I don't
have tabs on it yet, so I don't dare drive it around here. But what I
found in the archives implies it's either too lean at the carb(s) &lt;&lt;but
I have fuel injection&gt;&gt;or an exhaust leak. Witch I can buy since, A: The
muffler is missing the output tip, and B: I didn't use the copper
seals/gaskets when I put on the muffler, and C: It's MY car!
 
Could someone tell me if this actually IS probably the reason, or if
it's more likely to be Vacuum Hoses (witch I can also buy as being the
culprit) or some other thing. But more importantly, can someone tell me
the mechanics of how a exhaust leak would cause backfires? I would think
that the faster the gassess can excape the happier the whole thing would
be. I'm obviously wrong, but why?
