Subject: Re:  Fuel injector repair

Lee:

You can repair the old injector.  I used a electrical wire cutter to cut
off the metal swage ring, then pulled off the old hose.  Just use a clamp
when you install the new piece of hose.  Replace all the hoses if they are
just as old as the one that is leaking.  Use the OE style clamps if you
can.  The regular plumbing style worm clamps often cut into the hose at the
base of the worm mechanism, weakening the hose and causing new leaks.

Good luck,
