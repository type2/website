Subject: Re: [T2] 10-14 degrees this morning

Jamey,

For sure!  78 bus with 74 type heater boxes and exhaust.  Heater boxes are
brand new and all cables/hoses are tight and fit well.

The tubing from back to front is intact(no leaks) and the tubing was 
cleaned/vacuumed of *all* old debris when I rebuilt everything.

Door/window/fresh air seals are tight and closed.

Blows nice *hot* air up front.

I know that a lot of people complain about their heat in a bus, but out of 
the 67, 72, 78 that I have owned, a little attention to the heater system 
has always gotten me a warm bus.

Just remember also that we are talking interstate rush hour 
speeds....70+mph for 15 miles or so.

My wife claims the bus always warms up faster than her Saturn.

Detail, detail, detail  = great bus heat!

We expect 8 degrees next Wed morning, I'll measure outlet temps and let 
you know!


Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; Moved it out of the garage last night and let it sit over night outside in
&gt; &gt; 10-14 degree temps.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Went out this morning and fired right up.  Let it idle for awhile and then
&gt; &gt; off to the bumper car races on the interstate ...took a little longer to
&gt; &gt; get comfy heat inside, but was nice after about 5 miles.

&gt; Comfy heat in a BUS? C'mon.........
