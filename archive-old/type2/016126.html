Hey again list,
    Quick and easy question.  Can I use a 009 distributor for a 1973 bus. 
Bus Depot has the 009 listed only up to 1971, and the 050 from 72 on.  I
realize the advantages to the 050 but I can get a good deal at Larry's Off
Road for a 009 distrubutor, bosch blue coil, and plug wires (79.95) and do
not think he even carries the 050.  So if anyone knows for sure if the 009
will work I would like to order it.
thanks,
Seth and the 1973 &quot;Cheetah&quot;
