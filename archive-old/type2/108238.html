Subject: Re: [T2] Valves

Well I got the head out and examined it.  The valve is just starting let
loose.  Borrowed a used head (AMC) from a friend and got that back in with
new pushrod tube seals and finally decided to wait for daylight to finish as
I couldn't get the tin to do what I wanted it to.

If all goes well tomorrow I will be gone for two weeks on vacation to
Indigebus and Oktoberbus.  I shall get in touch with AVP when I return.  I
shall let everyone know how it goes when I return.

I shall be unsubscribing from the T2/vintagebus lists while I am gone so my
mail doesn't get too full.  If anyone needs to get in touch with me, please
pmail me and I'll answer when I return...

Thanks for all the help today..

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
