Subject: Re: [T2] Glass and Jailbars

&gt; I'm curious as to why the jailbars fell out of vogue
&gt; here on the North American continent. 

The jailbars were only delivered on the deluxe
microbuses which VW calls 'type 24'. Most microbuses I
have seen from the USA are actually regular microbuses
('type 22'). The reason that they look 'deluxe' is
because of the chrome set which was part of the
US-specifications.

If someone on the list knows of a Type 24 (first two
numbers of the chassisnr) then let me know. I am
curious if the jailbars are there or were there in the
past.

Also Chris Cybulski once pointed out to me that early
US Baywindows never have the rubber molding on the
bumpers which you can see on Deluxe European buses.
May be this also has to do with the Type 22/24 thing.

&gt; Am I unaware of a series of jailbars that may have
&gt; been in existance
&gt; for the late bay  glass variation?

Could you describe what you mean? I think the jailbars
remained the same in from begin until the end of the
German production (1967-1979).
