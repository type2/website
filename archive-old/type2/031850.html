One of the best things you can get for your CB is Radio Shack's SWR
(Standing Wave Ratio) meter.  It's so that you can tune your antenna by
adjusting it's overall length.  This little gizmo measures how much
reflected RF energy is actually put back into your radio.  With a mere 4
watts to play with on CB, you want to make sure every last milliwatt you
transmit is actually being sent out in the air.  On larger HAM radios, you
can literally burn up your radio by transmitting high power on a
mis-matched antenna.

Using an SWR meter, I've tuned up a CB on a stretched out coat hanger wire
trimmed to length and ran circles around guys with their elcheapo and
untuned dually antennas.  When you get into radio further, you can
actually get or make &quot;matchers&quot; which are little more than a variable
capacitor.  They &quot;soak up&quot; the extra RF (sorta kinda) so that you can talk
on things like clothes hanger wire, barbed wire fence (HUGE horizonal
plane antenna!!!), and even a set of bed springs.  Funny but true.

Spending a little time tweaking your CB and using a K40 antenna are IMHO
the best ways to make your CB &quot;go the extra mile.&quot;
