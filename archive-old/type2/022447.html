&gt; &gt;Subject: [T2] DPD Air Conditioning unit
&gt;
&gt; &gt;I recently bought a '69 Bus and was suprised to find this cool a/c unit
&gt; &gt;under the dash. This is my first air-cooled VW and am unfamiliar 
&gt; with all
&gt; &gt;these spiffy after-market add on's. I'm getting totally obsessed with
&gt;fixing
&gt; &gt;my Bus and buying manuals; thus, my question:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Is there anyone out there with spec sheets or and operating manual 
&gt; for this
&gt; &gt;a/c unit. It was installed in the Bus in '72 in San Antonio, TX. I 
&gt; looked
&gt; &gt;all through the archives and found some interesting info, but no 
&gt; leads in
&gt;my
&gt; &gt;direction. The company seems to be defunct-at least no where to be 
&gt; found in
&gt; &gt;San Antonio. I'll pay for xerox copies and shipping (I live in Austin).
================================&gt;
Good grief !!
This bus may have been my cousin's.
His was a '69 that he bought in '72 after A/C had already been 
installed in it.
What is the color combo, and is it a camper hard top?
