Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon seats in a 77?

Hi Gary,

The only &quot;Why not&quot; would be if you're really tall. Since the Vanagon  
has a lower fender well where the seat is mounted, the seat itself is  
about an inch taller. Not a big deal for most people, but  it could  
be an issue for those who are really tall or like wearing fancy  
hats. ;-)


Happy trails,

&gt; Since my drivers seat needs a bit of TLC, like some broken springs  
&gt; welded, is it possible to put newer vanagon seats in it?
&gt; I saw how comfy they looked and thought... why not.
