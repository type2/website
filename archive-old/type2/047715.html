Subject: [T2] RE:  VW Bus Manuals on CD

&gt; The advertisement that I got from RBB stated that 1.) the manuals
&gt; support both Windows and Mac O/S and 2.) they retail for $99.95 and
&gt; appear to come with on-line support.
&gt;
&gt; The Vanagon manual will be available next Friday (10-27), the EV
&gt; manual is scheduled for December 6.  I suspect that they are releasing
&gt; them in order based on 'dead tree' manual sales.



For those who don't feel the need to buy a copy on the very first day it's
available, I will have the electronic Bentley manuals shortly after the
release dates at substantial listmember discounts.
