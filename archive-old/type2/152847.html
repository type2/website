&gt; I am a huge fan of the Fiat X-1/9 Bertone and was really bummed to see it 
&gt; get crushed. I love mid engined cars and it was such a shame. There was no 
&gt; rust in the typical areas too. I mean, it's not like there's an unlimited supply 
&gt; of X-1/9s in the country.
&gt; 
&gt; Have you considered getting a Fiero and rebodying it as an X-1/9...?-)
