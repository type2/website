Subject: seats

Hi everyone, this is my first posting on your way cool mailing list, so bear
with me if I don't know all the correct jargon.  I just recently purchased a
1969 Westy, all stock and in pretty good shape.  I have a couple of
questions I figure some of you might be able to help me with.  First, I need
new (or different) front seats.  The driver's seat is out of a Dodge van and
the passenger seat is out of a later model Westy (completely thrashed).
What is the best way to get some semi-stock seats?  Should I try to find
some at a local junk yard and recover them?  If so, where can I find kits to
do it?  My second problem is the key only works in the driver's door lock.
The rear hatch is permanently locked for now (should I have a locksmith do a
mold to make a key? or should I try to disassemble it and get one with a key
that works?). I have the same problem on the sliding door and passenger side
door.  Any suggestions would be appreciated greatly.
