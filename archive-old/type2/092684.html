Subject: Re: [T2] need advice on traveling back east

Inquire about parking arrangements.

I was there in 1994 for the Navy Fleet Week and parking appeared to be 
limited and safe parking was even more limited.

I think your best bet would be to park out in one of the boroughs and ride 
the subway or busses into the city.

We walked, rode the subway, and took a couple of taxis.

Saw so much, missed so much too. Wished we had gotten away from Manhattan 
and Soho and Greenwich but we were all small town Southern boys and none of 
us knew what to make of it all. Overwhelming.


&gt;I am asking anyone on the list in the NYC area to
&gt;offer any suggestions or advice (or maybe a place to
&gt;park for a night) on getting around the city. We plan
&gt;on going to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island and
&gt;since I have never been to NYC, I have no idea what to
&gt;expect.
&gt;If there is anyone in the area who would offer travel
&gt;advice or know of any places we should not miss,
&gt;please e-mail me and let me know.
&gt;Thanks so much in advance

Chris Mills in TN
