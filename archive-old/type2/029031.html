If I only had time to grab a handful, I'd get:

- wrenches (2-10mm, 13mm, 14mm, 17mm/19 
  combo, adjustable and monkey)
- screwdrivers (1 regular flat, 1 regular phillips, 
  1 BFS[really big screwdriver])
- stock lugnut tool with socket and rod.
- multimeter
- claw hammer
- Arkansas stone, file, and knife
- Channel locks, regular plyers, needlenose and 
  vice grips.

Too hard to pick one tool that's changed my life the most--probably the computer--but between the grinder, welder, and air tools, I sometimes make my own tools to do the job. Hmmm...maybe it's my brain that I like the most. I'll have to think about that though.

Take care! Joe
