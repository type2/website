Hi Mark

&gt; Hi Wil,

&gt; I am looking at this for my van, as we're paying ~$3.28(USD)/gallon
&gt; up here in Victoria, BC, Canada.

&gt; -Mark

That is sincerely harsh!  Average in the U.S. just hitting $2 from
what I've heard and it seems around that in the Baltimore, MD area.

Using the bike or picking up a motorcycle for those short jaunts is
becoming more the norm.  I need to lose a few pounds anyway.

; )

Still the Vanagon gets better mileage than my old '69 Chevelle did
(307 ci.).

Still, I've always suspected that there were safe ways to introduce
gas in a more combustible form that were supressed by mainstream
manufacturers.

I remember seeing a Congressional hearing in the 70's (gas crisis) 
that included an inventor/mechanic who built a diesel powered 
Pinto that got 88 mpg or close to it.  As he was testifying he was 
interrupted by an offer to buy it outright from a car 
manufacturer....never saw it again.

It's things like that that fuel the conspiracy theories surrounding
car makers and oil companies.

&gt;&gt; Anyone looked into this? My 2.0L is FI so it probably wouldn't work
&gt;&gt; but I'm wondering about converting a traditionally carberated
&gt;&gt; engine.

&gt;&gt; $2.00+/gal is too much.


&gt;&gt; Sincerely,



Sincerely,
