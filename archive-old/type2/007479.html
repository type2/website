Subject: new engine? should I or not?
Date: Wed, 28 Oct 1998 23:38:56 PST

Hey- I have a '72 Westy with an orignal pancake 1700cc engine.  My head 
is cracked and instead of replacing it a friend sugessted that I just 
get a new 1800cc or 2100cc.  
First question? Will the 2100cc fit in my engine compartment? or even 
the 1800cc for that matter?
Second question?  Has anyone done this?  Will the cost be not worth it?  
what is the avg cost to replace the engine?

Thanks in advance for your help.
