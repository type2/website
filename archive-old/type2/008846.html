&gt;I came across a crossover pipe for my '78 at a flea market a couple of

&gt;always got an eye out for these pipes.
&gt;
&gt;Does your '76 require the intake air preheating tube on the crossover
&gt;pipe?  This was standard on chassis numbers before 226 2077 584 per
&gt;Bentley.

I don't believe so.  At least the configuration left by the previous owner
doesn't have one.

&gt;But within only
&gt;about 30 minutes of running, the silvery high temperature paint was
&gt;blistering and peeling off the crossover pipe like a very fine tin
&gt;foil.  On the other hand, the barbeque paint has simply gone from its
&gt;original satin black to a flat back color.

Someone else told me that their BBQ paint burnt off fairly quickly.  I
wonder if these vary a bit by brand.

Thanks for your reply.  I'll keep my eye open for crossover pipes.

Todd
