Subject: [T2] 34pict3 not adjusting

Hello listees,

I am following the Bentley instructions on adjusting my 34pict3
carb and on step 6 it says to turn the idle mixture screw(small
screw on the left of the carb body) to obtain the fastest possible
idle...then your supposed to turn idle mixture adjusting screw
clockwise (closing) until engine speed drops 20-30 rpm's.

Now, when I turn the mixture screw the idle speed doesn't vary.
With the rpm's at about 900 I can turn the mixture screw all the
way in and almost all the way out with zero variation in engine
speed.  I have a tach/dwell meter to verify this.  What can this
mean??

I would have thought that with the mixture screw seated
the engine would die from lack of fuel.

Also,  the carb won't hold a steady idle, it lopes from about 850
to 1000 rpm's and occasionally saunters  up to 1400, 1500 rpm's.
What's up with that??  Vacumme leak?

I would appreciate any replys as I would like to have it pass
emissions on the first try.  :)    FWIW timing is 5 deg ATDC and 
dwell is at 46 deg.
