&gt;So take your &quot;new&quot; Chevy out and see how many other Chevy drivers wave... 
&gt;None?  Not surprising.
&gt;Now take you old &quot;classic&quot; Chevy out and see how many other &quot;classic&quot; 
&gt;Chevy drivers wave...  More huh?

Ellis observes:
Mrs. VanBondo and I stumbled across a 55/56/57 Chevy show a couple of
weekends ago. Typical array of examples were present. An overheard
conversation revealed that one of the owners admitted to spending &quot;over 40&quot;
on the car only after double checking to see if the wife was around before
'fessing up. &quot;She would absolutley kill me if she knew the real numbers&quot; the
fella whispered.
The car was far from the nicest at the show~ in fact it was real ordinary.
These comments made the Mrs. and I feel kinda like we cheaped out on ours.
Funny thing was that for some reason we got along extra well for the rest of
the evening. =)
