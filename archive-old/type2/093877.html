&gt;No - easy - just pull the shroud and hose it down at the car wash.

Oooh. You make that sound so temptingly easy.  It's been so long since I've
done any work on my motor without pulling the whole thing (and that was over
3 years ago!) that I don't remember:  Is the type IV fan housing easy to
remove with the engine in the bus?  

If that was out of the way the top side of the cooler should be pretty much
exposed and I could scrape/spray as needed.  However, I don't see how you
could drive to the car wash without the fan and housing in place and it
seems to involved to remove/install the thing AT the car wash.  Am I missing
something obvious?

Other listees (thanks Mat, Troy, and Nick) have suggested using cleansers
and pressurized water from underneath to clear away any gunk and debris.
Wouldn't this approach just relocate the offending materials to some other
place underneath the cooling tin?  Since the cooler on a type IV is
positioned horizontally, it seems like stuff would just fall back onto the
top of it and stay there.  Design flaw by VW?
