Subject: Re: [T2] Wiper Delay Relay


Well I'de love to tell you but I 'm not sure (still trying to get mine
working). I believe the switch lever is different. It has an additional
position. I would imagine if you found the part numbers and were able to
correctly read the wiring schematic it would be just a matter of swapping
out the switch, adding the relay and maybe some wiring.

I have a regular deluxe 78, wonder is it possible to add in the delay
system from a Champagne edition or a later bus, does my wiper lever have
the contacts and are the parts avaliable.  (yes I know the after market
ones are out there and that is my 2nd choice)

Bob

&gt; work fine in both speeds but when I move the lever down to the delay
&gt; setting nothing happens. I suspect the relay as all my wiring is in great
&gt; shape. There are several relays on the fuse panel and I am not sure what
&gt; each one does. I know the small metal cased one is for my flashers, I
&gt; suspect one is a fuel pump relay for the FI, the others...? Is this info
in
&gt; Bentley? I'm at work and don't have the manual with me. I also have a
&gt; Haynes and maybe it is in there?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
