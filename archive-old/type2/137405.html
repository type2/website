Subject: Pulling a Vintage RV with a Bus 

The Airstream web site lists a 16 foot Bambi at 2,925 pounds empty and 
without options. There are large ones, but let's use the smallest on the 
list. It can then be loaded with about 500 pounds of additional cargo and 
options and fluids. Hitch weight is 440 pounds. It is 9 ft 4 inches high 
and 8 feet wide. That is over 72 square feet of frontal wind resistance, 
about like a small sailboat canvas. At 20 miles an hour, try holding a 72 
square foot sail out the window. A 20 mph wind is a HIGH wind for sailors. 
It is a snail's pace for road traffic. You will be forced by law to drive 
at least 40 mph on many highways. The push on the sail at that speed is 
ENORMOUS. Your type 2 probably can't maintain it flat out in third gear.

You might get away with towing an unladen Bambi at 40 mph for short trips 
on dry level roads with no head winds, in light traffic on cool days. And 
it might just burn up your engine. The air resistance is a bigger factor 
than the weight of the trailer.

Now, consider the relative weights of the tow vehicle and the trailer. The 
Bambi (laden) approaches that of the tow vehicle. Weight-wise, you are 
almost doubling the load on the engine, not even considering the enormous 
extra load of overcoming wind resistance at road speed.

Type 2's aren't known for having excess engine power at road speed, even 
without a towing+frontal area  load. Think about how a passing truck causes 
the unladen van to yaw from side to side. There is a great deal of tall 
flat side area to catch a cross wind. Now hitch 3,000 pounds on the tail 
and push down the rear end with 440 pounds of tongue weight. The yaw is 
harder to recover from. It starts an oscillation that rapidly becomes 
uncontrollable. You need 50 more pounds of anti-sway torsion bars to even 
consider towing the Bambi. The hitch itself is going to be a very heavy 
frame-mounted assembly, certainly independent of the bumper.

Introduce into that scenario the realistic and probable issues of  wet 
pavement, high winds, warm weather, heavy traffic, long trips, a few 
emergency stops, and hills or even mountains.

Any ONE of those additional issues pushes your rig well past the limit of 
being able to reliably and safely deal with the situation. If you drive it 
long enough, you will eventually skid, jack-knife, yaw, pitch, fishtail, or 
otherwise lose control of the rig, provided you don't burn out the engine 
or clutch.

I wouldn't do it.

Pull that Bambi if you must....with a vintage 350 cubic inch V8 Chevy 
Suburban equipped with a towing package, like all the other Airstreamers.
