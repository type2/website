Subject: Valve seat noise

Hi gang...

Looking for some first-hand knowledge here....I've had an occasional
clattery sound on my 77 2.0 FI...adjusted the lifters (hydraulics), and
they were all over the map on adjustment...Ran smooth as silk
afterwards, but the clatter is still there, and worse than ever...so
here's the question....

1) If a valve seat is lose, does it sound like a ball bearing rattling
around inside...similar to the sound of a convertor with lose insides??

2) does a lose valve seat show up in a compression test??mine is
125-130, so to me it's right on track....CA model with Convertor &amp; full
stock exhaust.

I've driven this bus about 500 miles on what the P/O said was a rebuilt
engine...it runs very strong at 70 to 75mph (and I figure she would have
scattered by now if it was anything serious)...1-2 side inside the cover
and around the springs and on the head is dirty like it hasn't been
apart, while the 3-4 side is clean as a whip...no contaminents in the
oil or sump plate to speak of...now running synthetic with plenty of oil
pressure.

This one has me stumped...I've rebuilt more than my share of VW engines
over the past 20 plus years....raced em off-road, Ice racing &amp;
drags...they were either real solid &amp; ran forever, or came apart with a
bang cause I over reved em at the top end out of stupidity.....but
nothing in between like this one...runs real strong, but I don't like
the sound of it.

I could sit here and guess all day, but I want to talk to someone who
has had a seat come lose...I have myself talked into a bad seat, but I'm
not convinced that's what it is..._dot_can you get a rattle in an automatic
tranny that comes &amp; goes while the thing is in park??

Plan is to take the 3-4 side rockers off &amp; put a flatedge across the top
of the valves...aside from that, it's pulling the sucker out for a
little search &amp; locate before the spring cruisin gets underway...I need
the Sunwarrior to be as reliable as it looks..

Spare engine is out of a 75 FI w/automatic...it'll be a 1.8 won't it??
Or converting a 79 Federal stick engine that I'm not sure of the
origin...or building one from scratch......ahhhhh...so many
decisions....

Opinions are gladly accepted...but I'm looking for input from people
with first hand knowledge if possible...

Thanks for listening...Den.
