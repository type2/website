Subject: 77 side door for green bus
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

I have put the door from a 77 era bus on Thom Fitzpatrick's auction website.
It is really a giveaway but you must pick it up, or I will take it to 
Bug-o-rama or Kelley park.
I live in Cupertino Ca, in the South Bay of San Francisco.

Have a great day
