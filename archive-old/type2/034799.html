Don,

I know the extension is out there because I have one on my '72 and it's
great.  However, mine was a gift and that was purchased at a swap meet.  Try
calimports - www_dot_calimports_dot_com - the might have it.

Good luck
Phil

Subject: shift knob extensions?


 I want to put the VDO 3 guage under dash console in.  My shift knob will
hit
it in first.  I've determined the thread on rod is a 12mm 1.5 thread, and
I've fooled around with various plumbing fixtures to make some kind of wacky
extension, but I just can't get it right.  Anyone know a source for some
kind
of metric threaded rod, 90's or couplers?  I've also heard of a bolt -on,
but
don't know where to get one that is '71 bus friendly.  I couldn't find
anything in archives either.  Also, does anyone know if a little Sunpro tach
will fit the VDO rubber console?
