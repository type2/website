&gt; Ever since I got my type IV engine running it has been going thru alt
&gt; belts about every 3 months. The belts wear along the rear facing edge

&gt; without AC. My reasoning is this: AC engines have that funky pully
&gt; between the fan and hub which must space  out the fan away from the
&gt; engine some. This would cause some mis-alingment between the fan pully
&gt; and the alt pully. The point is that I did not put the pully in. Anyone
&gt; know about this?

Yup, there is the pully, if you remove it you must put a spacer in to keep
everything in alignment.

the only fix is to take the fan off and put the pully back or a similar
sized spacer.  you should be able to do this without pulling the engine
but it is a PITA.
