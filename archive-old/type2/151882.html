Subject: Re: [T2] Land Rover Wheels

Jamie,

bummer....near as I can tell....  5x114.3

114.3 just happens to be 4.5 inches...it is/was a &quot;british&quot;
car after all.

Notice from the site that almost all Audi's and mercedes are 5x112

Cheers, dave

&gt; About all I could find out was .... nice wheels.. look like wide 5.. they 
 had 16&quot; tires.. and it is a land rover.. said something like i90 on the rear 
&gt; gate....
 
&gt; Has anyone else seen these.. where would I look to see if they are the same 
 stud pattern as an early bus?
