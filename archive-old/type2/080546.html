Subject: winterizing kit

Hello list,
I just came across a 1972 winterizing kit which consists of pads that cover 
part of the air intake vents on rear the bus.  I guess in theory this would 
cut down the amount of cold air hitting the engine allowing the engine to get 
warmer and thus produce more heat to interior of the bus.  This is new to me. 
 Does it really work this way?  Any info appreciated!  Thanks for your help.
