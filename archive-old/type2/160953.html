Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Homemade air conditioner in a VW? G.Lyle?

My thinking is not to drain the water as it is cooling, but only when the
time comes to empty some water out to add more ice. I mean really, who needs
the extra heavy lifting, sloshing of liquids, and moving of equipment when
you can flip a lever and accomplish the same thing? There were some amazing
results on flash cooling beer on Mythbusters which showed the best cooling
was obtained by submerging the cans in heavily salted ice water, which
should chill the coolant in the lines equally fast. In any case, this line
of thought is more of a diversion to help deal with cabin fever than an plan
to be put in actual use, but somebody out there with limited funds (who like
me lives in a very humid area of the country which precludes the use of a
swamp cooler) may want to actually try it out.

&gt; Me, I avoid the mess by freezing water in
&gt; old OJ cartons and putting them in my cooler- gives you drinkable cold
&gt; water to boot.
