Subject: Re: [T2] Early Bay Seat replacement

What happens when you post a defective seat mount installation
on the internet? Does that increase your responsibility in
the event of a future fatal crash and subsequent litigation?
Would that include anyone else who followed your recommendation?

&gt; Recalling a recent thread re: alternative seats for a Bay Bus I thought I'd
&gt; share these pix of the install I just completed in my son's 71 Riviera.  (he
&gt; just purchased it from me last month)
&gt; I posted some pix at: http://photos.yahoo_dot_com/olyolsenmt13

&gt; Let me know if you have any questions, this write up in likely clear as mud
&gt; and if one took more time in the planning stages it would probably turn out
&gt; cleaner.
