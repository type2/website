&gt; I thought the Dormobiles had the same interior. The pics I saw from
&gt; Scott looked like Jersey's Dor at last year's Everybus.

Jersey's 'dor' is just a dor-topped westy.  the so69 was the common
interior to find under them, just as the so-44 is oft found under
dor-toped westies for the late splits.  

the &quot;real&quot; dormobile roof is, from what I understand, possitioned slightly
different then the westfalia installed tops.

The &quot;real&quot; dor's have totally funky interiors.  Jaime has a picture of his
neighbors bay-dor somewhere...


anywho.;)

...david (oh. Dormobile interiors dont get westfalias SO- designations,
either...;)
