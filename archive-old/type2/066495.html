Subject: Impending road trip!

Well, in about a week i expect to leave this miserable blackhole of a 
town, and end up in Kansas City...&lt;where my dad lives...&gt;

The original plan was to head from here&lt;Augusta GA&gt; up through the 
carolina's, to virginia, the go west through either kentuky or ohio etc...

But due to the beginning of the chilly season, i may just go accross the 
gulf coast then up...i dont know yet...

Or, if the friend who might want to go, &lt;she wants out of this town as 
much as i do!!&gt; cant go, i might just hit i20 to birmingham, stop in 
Aniston to see my gramma, and next door in oxford to visit a LARGE 
&lt;stacked 3 high&gt; vw 'yard i am told is there...and maybe get my uncle to 
buy it...:)   but anyway...


If anyone has suggestions or wouldn't mind meeting a 19 year old who's 
been living out of his 69 bus for a few months...what ever....letme know...



oh! and if there are shell stations with in 200 miles of each other?! 
&lt;dads shell card pays the way!&gt; i know they arent in KC, but i'll have 
enough cash to cover that..:)





and sorry the all the numerous typos......david
