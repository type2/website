&gt; Dan is right that the VW kit is better than many of the aftermarket
kits,
&gt; but I have found an additional trouble spot in this setup.  On mine,
the
&gt; clevis pins and cabl end used to go bad with amazing speed and a close
&gt; examination showed that the hole in the plate on the arm was very
oval.  I
&gt; replaced that dog-bone shaped plate and have had no trouble since. 
Take a
&gt; look at the plate that the cable goes thru if the cable is breaking
at the
&gt; clevis pin. 

Often the cable failures can be traced to wear in the hole through
which the clevis pin passes in the clutch arm.  The pin wears the hole
oval and also wears a groove in itself.  The two pieces wear to each
other and the cable clevis stops pivoting on the pin while the clutch
operates.  This causes stress where the cable attaches to the clevis
as the attachment is flexed back and forth under the pull of the cable.

The solution is to repair the oval hole back to its original round
form (I simply fill the hole with a gas welder, grind the arm back
flat on both sides, and redrill the hole.

I replaced the clevis pin with a standard bolt, making sure that the
pivoting occurs on the shoulder of the bolt, not the threads.

This fix won't last forever, but the original lasted 250K miles and
this one should do about as well :)
