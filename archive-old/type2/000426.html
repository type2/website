Subject: fuel lines and engine fires

All this talk about engine fires really scares the hell out of me. I have
the rubber grommets in place and I do have fire extinguishers but I would
rather not have to use them so I intend to have all fuel lines replaced
ASAP.

My generic question is: can the lines be replaced  without pulling the tank
(and engine) to get access to where they are attached to the tank?

1- Specifically for a '77 bus with a 1600 DP (European bus). Fuel line seems
to pass the bulkhead on the left (drivers) side.

2- Ditto for a '78 2 litre. Fuel line is on the right  side.
