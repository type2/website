Subject: scat camshaft and timing

--part1_188.ea129cc.2ac3c96e_boundary

List,
  Does anyone have experience running a scat camshaft in a bay window bus an=
d=20
specifically what to set the timing to?=20
 Here are my specs:  '74 bus with 1800 engine and stock dual diaphragm=20
distributor.  Scat products mild performance cam stock number  sc20086 and i=
s=20
.430L/276D   And the scat bolt-on timing gear sc20171.
  I have timed and run the engine and it seems to run well but...  the timin=
g=20
according to the mark on the stock cooling fan puts the timing at 40=B0 BTC=20=
 =20
This seems way too advanced to me but if I retard the timing it doesn't run=20
as well.  I also suspect that it may be too advanced because the starter=20
&quot;binds&quot; very slightly sometimes when the engine is starting as if it were=20
fighting against the engine.  (This is a new starter with the WR1 hot start=20
relay installed).
  I know that I saw instructions in the library or somewhere on setting=20
timing when dealing with an unknown quantity like this engine and cam.  Can=20
anyone supply me with any insight or lead me to a source to read up on it?
Thanks!
Jim
