Subject: RE:  checking oil cooler

&gt;I would like to check the oil cooler before re-installing it.  Is there

&gt;a procedure for doing so?   I thought of pouring solvent in one port 
&gt;and making sure it flows out of the other.  But the thought of 
&gt;residual solvent diluting my oil has kept me from doing this.

I'll probably get flamed for this, but on recommendation of a VW-nut
friend of mine, I cleaned my newly acquired, used, vatted-by-the-seller
type IV cooler with gasoline.  The guy I bought it from said he had
cleaned it in his 'vat', but my friend said, &quot;You never know...&quot;.

So I poured gas in it and sloshed it around a bunch and emptied it out.
Did this several times until the gasoline was coming out crystal clear.
Then blew it out with compressed air (wear goggles!).  I figured even if
a tiny bit of gasoline was still living in there, it wouldn't hurt me
for the initial start-up of the engine anyways.

Glad I did this because after I was done with the gasoline bit, I
noticed a rattling sound in the cooler.  Shook it around a bit more and
blew more compressed air through it and finally dislodged a big piece of
plastic that was in there.  Maybe it floated in when the cooler was
being cleaned in a vat originally?  Who knows...
