Subject: Temporarily plugging fuel lines

While replacing a fuel injector and do some more work in the area, I 
had concerns about getting stuff into the metal tupping for the fuel 
ring. I slipped a cap from a felt tipped pen over the opening.

&gt;&gt;I've found golf tees to work great for plugging the fuel line!  I've used
&gt;&gt;them on my '70 but haven't tried them on my '78 which I think has 7mm ID
&gt;&gt;instead of 5mm ID fuel lines.  It should still work though since the golf
&gt;&gt;tee flares.
&gt;
&gt;#2 Pencils work well too. I have also used thick shaft Phillips 
&gt;Screwdrivers too. Just tightened the clamps back down on the 
&gt;screwdriver once inserted into the hose.
&gt;
&gt;I like the petcock idea best.
&gt;
