&gt; Went to Midas the other day to have a complete replacement of my
exhaust on
&gt; the T*y*ta. Saw a bug up on the lift. Said to the guy, you replace Bug
&gt; Mufflers? He said, veery slowly, yes, we do. I pondered this for a
moment,
&gt; and asked the inevitable question: do you guarantee them for life? He
&gt; paused, looking unhappy, and answered slowly, yes. I asked how much
and he
&gt; said $100. (how much is a bus muffler german issue for a 68-71?
About $90) I
&gt; thought to myself gold mine! Ok I don't have a bug. I have a bus, I
don't
&gt; like mechanics, I do it all myself, but what if they could do the
work for
&gt; me?
&gt; I know we are all a special group of individuals, who rely on our
own work,
&gt; but what if the midas company is our &quot;stainless muffler&quot;? My mind
reels with
&gt; the thought.
&gt; I will have to work up alot of courage to take the 69, 70 and 63 to
the
&gt; shop, but I cant help but see the value here!

1. replacement mufflers are free, but they will charge you a lot for
peripheral stuff.  It ends up costing the same as a new muffler

2. do you really want to take your VW to people whose idea of
&quot;precison work&quot; is to use a 2-pound hammer instead of a 3-pound?

You get what you pay for.  A free muffler will cost you in the long run.
