Subject: Fuel Neck Restrictor

Anyone familiar with replacing the fuel neck restrictor on a '78 or '79
bus.  It's the L shaped piece of rubber that connects the gas cap to a
hose connected to the gas tank.  Mine is split and I've been advised to
fix it, for fear of gasoline fumes entering the cab.  Is this a real
possibility?  I understand that to replace the piece of rubber, you
either have to drill a hole in the cab, or remove the gas tank.  Is this
true?  Does anybody have any experience replacing this piece of
rubber???
