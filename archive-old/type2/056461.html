Hello... 

Probably a dead horse by now, but before I wrack my brain tonight
installing it, I was curious if my oil temp sensor/gauge needs a power
supply from somewhere?

As I understand it, I just run the positive from the dipstick sensor to
the positive at the gauge and the negative to the negative.  Tap into the
speedo light to light the temp gauge and I'm in business.  I read the VDO
instructions that came with the gauge, but didn't find them terribly
helpful.  

Am I missing anything?

Thanks,

Tom
