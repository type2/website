Subject: [No VW] Record repair

Hi Volks,
This doesn't have any vw stuff, but I figured that someone on this list
would know. My friend has a warped phonograph record, (you remember those?),
and we need a way to &quot;fix&quot; it. The tape machine at the tape I had of it and
I miss it.
I figured that with as much &quot;creative engineering&quot; this list has in keeping
these old vw's rolling, someone might know. I also thought that someone on
this list might remember what a record was!
E-mail is ok to keep the list as vw as possible.
Thanks,
Rob
