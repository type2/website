&gt;&gt; Those timing marks are BTDC (before top dead center) not ATDC (after top

&gt;&gt; and watch the marks if you don't believe me!
&gt;
&gt;        Of course they are BTDC -- what in my post gave you the impression
&gt;that I thought they weren't??

you said...

&gt;Stock pulleys vary as to timing notches -- but I think 3 of them
&gt;should be 7.5, 5, 0, reading clockwise.

Reading clockwise (or left to right) directly from the pulley in the above 
order would indicate 7.5 (ATDC), 5 (ATDC), 0 (TDC).

Reading clockwise (or left to right) directly from the pulley the marks 
would be 0 (TDC), 5 (BTDC), 7.5 (BTDC).

I thought the way you stated it was confusing &amp; I tried to clarify.  It 
was not meant as a flame (I used a couple of smileys for the humor 
impaired).
