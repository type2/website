&gt; Did you check that the flapper in the AFM is not stuck?  That might be
&gt; messing you up.

one of the first things checked.

&gt;  Is your cold-start injector leaking by chance?

why would a backfire damage that??  but I did check it and it appears to
be fine.. it starts fine, and after the engine gets up to maybe 185
degrees it &quot;Ran&quot; better not sure now.

&gt; manifold  vacuum good?

next on my list.  it's hard to check when you can't keep it running
without holding the throttel part way open...
