&gt; What years will interchange with a 82 Vanagon in the Torque converter?

I am pretty sure that all 73-83 torque convertors are the same, not sure
about the water cooled ones but I would suspect that even later torque
convertors would fit maybe all the way to Eurovan.  

&gt; I am still looking for a torque converter for a 82 vanagon
&gt; any out there ? your help would be appreciated

I actually found a new (refurbished??) one not long ago at a transmission
rebuilders for $125
