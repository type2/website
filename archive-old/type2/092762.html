Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel Line cutoff alternative

Yes that would work perfectly.

I'm trying to sort out the electric valve so that if there is a gasoline 
fire in my bus I can simply turn off the engine and the valve will close 
automatically thus depriving the fire of any additional fuel and enabling 
me to put there fire out successfully.

Also I could hide a switch in the van someplace so that even if a thief 
manages to hot wire the bus - it won't go.


&gt;look at this link, im about to do it now i have the same valve.  Friends of
&gt;medid it and add stainless steel fitting and copper tubing:
&gt;
&gt;http://members.tripod_dot_com/~VWDORMOBILE/REJEAN/id4.htm

Lastly beware of copper tubing I am told that the vibrations of the engine 
can cause this type of metal to work harden and then crack leading to fuel 
spills and possible fires. Would be better to use steel. I have not heard 
anything bad about stainless steel.

Good luck.
