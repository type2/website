Subject: Road Trip -short-

We finally made it home from our cross country road
trip. We started from Reno NV and traveled up to
Canada to attend the Busses by the Falls and then down
to NY to visit the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island
and down to Washington DC and vicinity. We traveled
home going up through North Dakota and out to Glacier
National Park, visited a friend in Sand Point Idaho
for a couple of days and out to Seattle and then than
the Olympic Peninsula and south through Portland and
then home.
We took over a month and traveled 7500 miles without
and real problems with our bus! You gotta love a pop
top camper!
One thing that really got our attention was the lack
of busses on the roads. We only saw maybe three
splits/bays the entire trip(with the exception of
Washington and Oregon where they were all over the
place)....People, take your bus out on the road. Drive
it really far, it just might make it.

I would like to thank everyone who sent offers of
hospitality and help if needed to us. I can't thank
the list enough for the brotherhood of the Bus!
Special thanks go to all of the Canadians at the
Busses by the Falls and to Steve Dolan. Steve took us
in and rescued us from the awful heat and humidity of
Washington DC. A complete stranger opening his door to
us for a couple of nights! Thanks a million Steve, and
sorry to keep you up so late talking on and on.
