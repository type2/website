&gt; &gt; I want a tachometer for my bus, but don't wanna spend the money for
&gt; a new one.
&gt; &gt;  Might someone out there have a spare they would part with for not
&gt; too much
&gt; &gt; dough?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Why don't you go to a junk yard and pull a suitable one from a car. 
&gt; I bought a
&gt; volt meter from a pick your part type yard and believe I paid about
&gt; $5 for it.

This is a great idea, just make sure that you get one from a 4 cyl car
or truck. I got one out of a Porsche and one out of a Isuzu Trooper,
both 4 cyl's. Stock tachs don't have a switch for selecting the # of cyl's
