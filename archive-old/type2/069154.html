&gt; &gt;I have just installed a new 1641 engine into my 71 bus.  The engine was

&gt; &gt;I called the guy who built the motor for me and he told me that the push
&gt; &gt;rods are &quot;three piece&quot; push rods and that the push rod for valve might be
&gt; &gt;colapsing or might have a &quot;burr&quot; on the end of the push rod that could be
&gt; &gt;causing this problem.  What does this mean?  I thought that push rods were
&gt; &gt;solid.

&gt;  It sounds from your description like the mechanic is on the right track.

It also sounds like the mechanic is trying to weasel.  I agree with Mike
and the mechanic in their diagnoses, but if the engine was rebuilt within
the last month (at a minimum), the responsibility for replacing the rod is
the mechanics, not yours.  You should have it towed back to him and *he*
should replace that pushrod.  While it is not his fault if the pushrod was
bad straight out of the box, it most certainly should fall under warantee. 
In addition, replacing that pushrod will be much cheaper for him than
rebuilding the engine *again* for free because the pushrod failed
catastrophically, so he should be thankful that you are observant and
persistant enough to discover the problem before the pushrod failed
completely
