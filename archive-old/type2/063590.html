&gt; 
&gt; Orange go-jo and the like are great but to really make life easy use &quot;liquid
&gt; gloves&quot;(might be &quot;invisible gloves&quot;) before doing any work. This is
&gt; apparently mostly glycerin and &gt; 
snip

A good heavy coat of lotion allowed to dry works really well
and keeps those hands soft in the meantime(meentime)...:-)
