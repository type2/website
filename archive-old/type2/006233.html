We're back home safe and sound from the 4-1/2 day road trip in Rivka and I
feel like gloating a little bit. For backround: &quot;Rivka&quot; is a 1974 Riviera
conversion transporter, manual trans. The AVP long block had about 1800
miles on it at the time we left. It's an 1.8 liter filled with Syntec 20/50
synthetic, running a Weber 32 DFEV and 009 dizzy with standard points
set-up. Between Thursday at 10PM and Monday at 4PM we clocked 1,124 miles,
traveling from western Kentucky to Southeast Michigan. Took super-slabs all
the way there, driving through the night when temps would be lower. On the
way home we broke the trip into two days, driving nothing but 2 lane state
and US highways. This seems to make sense since I don't push the bus much
over 55 on the Interstates anyway. ;-)

Air temps on the way home were in the mid-90's all the way (praise be to the
wing vents!) I'm happy to report that I couldn't see, feel or smell any sign
of overheating at any time. The second half of the homeward trip had some
twisty, hilly roads but she took them like a trooper. (I don't think the
people following me would say the same.) Rivka performed wonderfully the
entire way. It looks like the mountains for vacation this fall!

This does lead to one question: Has anyone had experience with installing a
sunroof in a bus of this vintage? I'm thinking of interior air flow, here.
Anything to keep the PASSENGERS a little cooler!

Thanks,
Dave
