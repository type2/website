Subject: Re: [T2] Westy Water Tank Crack

I think these tanks are made of polyethylene or polypropylene - at least 
that's what mine (came out of a 72) looks like.  Hopefully, the crack 
does not extend into the threaded drain hole, as this would be hard to 
sufficiently strengthen.  Youmight try drilling a small stress relief 
hole at that end (or both ends)of the crack to stop it from 
propagating.  Superglue (cyanoacrylate) and epoxy will not stick to 
polypropylene or polyethylene. The only adhesive I know of that might 
stick is Pliobond - get it at your local hardware store.   It is a heavy 
duty contact cement.  To bond reliably, it needs a large amount of bond 
surface area, i.e., just stuffing it into the crack will not produce a 
reliable repair.  So, try bridging the crack with a piece of plastic cut 
from a coffee can lid or something similar.

I would not want to try the soldering iron tip approach, as I'd be 
afraid of doing major damage.  I've heard of ultrasonic welding of 
plastic, but I imagine this requires big bux equipment and lots of skill.

&gt; 1969 Westy. I have a 1&quot; crack in the bottom of the plastic fresh water tank
&gt; adjacent to the threaded drain hole. Water does leak through this crack. The
&gt; crack looks fixable. I have thought of either using super glue or hitting it
&gt; with a soldering iron tip. I have also thought of screwing a greased-up tube
&gt; inside the drain thread (so the tube sticks inside the tank about two
&gt; inches), pouring some sort of epoxy inside the tank then removing the tube -
&gt; extreme, but what else is one to ponder whilst peering into a plastic water
&gt; tank?
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions are heartily welcome.
