&gt; I am going to replace the tires on my Westy this week, and prior to

check the archives there is mucho info on this subject

&gt; 
&gt; I have Michelin,185x75 R14's, on her now, and was thinking of going to
&gt; 205x70 R14's, in a Michelin also.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this a safe move up in size?

That's what I have been running on my 78 for many years
&gt; 
&gt; What is the largest tire that will fit, with stock suspension.

I think anything bigger than 205x70R14 would hit things
