&gt; Hey bob  If you think I'm gonna wear one of those you are really nuts  LOL

I don't wear one of &quot;those&quot; either, but rather the Michael Phelps type
with the mid thigh legs...   still a bit tight but holds' all the loose
stuff together around my waist so i can go thru the water smoother....

&gt; Now I will race you in canoes if you want that way I wont have to see you in
&gt; that speedo. My canoe is already on top of the Ghoost  my 66 westy  ,  We can

well as you probably know my canoe lives on the roof of my 78. and a race
would be fun....

&gt; even do this at Naturalbus on the james river right beside the campground june
&gt; 3rd weekend

still open on my calendar but not sure still trying to find a substitute
for that Sunday since I work on Sunday Mornings and finding a sub is
pretty hard I don't get to go to many away trips, nice thing about John
Brown's busses is that I can get home on Sat evening it's close enough.

Bob
