&gt;    I've spent all winter getting a BN2 gas heater ,that I bought, fixed up 
&gt; and running right.  Now I'm starting to think about installation into our 
&gt; &quot;71 westy.  Of course my first idea was to put it in the left side of the 
&gt; engine bay, but I'd like to reserve that space for a second battery.  Now 
&gt; I'm thinking of putting it under the bus in some sort of protective metal 
&gt; box.  I'd then take intake air from inside our westy and duct the heat into 
&gt; the normal heater tube. This would provide recirculation of the warm air 
&gt; from in the bus.  Of course exhaust from the heater would go overboard.
&gt;    I'd like to hear your opinions of my under bus scheme, and of any other 
&gt; locations and ideas that you think would be good.  Thanks for the input!

VW put a van heater under the center of the floor (BA-6???) so it can be
done.

I have a BA-4 mounted under the front of my van, in the  same location as
the AC condenser radiator.  I put a seperate fan essentially in the glove
box, with ducts to the heater, output is fed back into the regular heat
duct just behind the front axle

there are some problems, not much space, vulnerable location, and it gets
dirty as all get out.   
advantages, there is a very short heat path, recirculates air mostly in
the cab area, easy to work on

I would be very reluctant to put a heater inside the passenger compartment
because of the CO threat.  also when running they do make some noise. and
personally I don't want either gas or fire inside my cabin no matter how
well it is controlled
