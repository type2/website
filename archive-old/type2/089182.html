Subject: Re: [T2] Anyone wearing a POR-15 diaper?

I don't believe that you can either.  The POR-15 has to have some &quot;tooth&quot; to
adhere to.  Paint is a  finished surface, and does not qualify.  I'm also
not sure that it would protect the way it is intended if there is anything
between it and the paint it is trying to protect.  As I understand it, it
doesn't just seal it, but it continues to convert moisture after it has
cured.  This could be effective if moisture were to work between any of the
other layers and the metal.  I would think that you would need to strip the
section you want to cover. If you are going for an off-road type
application,  you could always cover the POR-15 with some type of &quot;Rino
Liner&quot; type hard truck bed liner material.  It would even further improve
the resistance to chips and such, not to mention give it a more functional
look.  I've seen treatments like this on dedicated off-road vehicles, though
I have never worked with them myself.

Subject: [T2] Anyone wearing a POR-15 diaper?


&gt; I really want to be able to drive my van year round, but I
&gt; want to protect it as best I can from rust. So I was thinking
&gt; about doing the entire underbody (a la http://www.bulley-
&gt; hewlett_dot_com/VWindex/)and maybe the first 12&quot; (up to the
&gt; indentation in POR-15. But I don’t think you can use POR-15
&gt; over paint… has anyone done this?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Chris
