Subject: RE: [T2] baby hammock

&gt; &gt; Got a baby coming in about 6 weeks, anyone got a cot they 
&gt; &gt; want to sell?

&gt; 68-73: the bars are 56 1/4&quot; long. 68-early 69 are round and 
&gt; black.  74-75 are 57 1/4&quot; long. 76-79 are 2 piece collapsible. 
&gt; They store under the 3/4 rear seat-bed. You can use the 74-75
&gt; bars but they are tough to store.
&gt; 
&gt; The difference in length was not because the 74+ bus is 
&gt; wider but because on the early buses they are mounted 
&gt; higher. The lower you go, the wider the space between the. 
&gt; pillar. 69-73 bars are very common. The 74-75 bars are
&gt; tough to find.  The 2 piece collapsible are next to impossible  
&gt; to find. All the canvas is the same from 68 to 79.


This might be a good time to mention that I have a closeout on
replacement childs cots - at $39.95 (originally $100). This includes the
canvas and the poles, but not the mounts on the A/B pillars (so if you
have a non-Westy you'd have to fabricate something there).  The poles
are the '74-75 style, meaning that they will also fit '76-79 (although
they are not collapsable), and will also fit '69-73 if you relocate the
mounts slightly. (Or, of course, they'll fit any year if you are
fabricating your own A/B pillar mounts.)  At this price, it's worth it
for the canvas alone; the original factory wholesale was more than the
current selling price!  Part # 7001
