Subject: Looking for a list member

Not sure of the protocol on this site, but I have need to reach
crangus_at_rof_dot_net, and cannot because my server says his email is over quota.  I
need to reach him, and wondered if anyone knew how, other than this &quot;addy&quot;, I
could.  Thanks, and I appologize for incursions in list protocol, but need to
reach him.
Sid
