&gt;  There was oil

Looks like you sprung an oil leak...   try pressure washing it off, and see if
the leak location is evident,, you may have to start it up to see it...

You might have one of those ADAPTERS on the oil pump that bolts a beetle engine
into a bus, and they work loose.

Check the nuts you can get to for tightness,,, 

Is there oil in the engine compartment,, it could be your oil sender switch ..
which an easy fix
