Subject: Re: [T2] starting fluid

Vitamin-E will not destroy any internal combustion engine if used in
moderation---

Now we have the nut cases who are determined to empty the can in one
unloading---and then your looking at big time preignition, and  possible
valve or piston burn----

Even a diesel engine overloaded with starting fluid-- even automatically
dispensed, will cause a hydraulic lock--not good.

Using common sense in it's application will generally cause no harm----


Later,


Terry

Dave Wolfanger sends: 
A diesel engine works by compressing kerosene ( or fuel oil ) until it
explodes. Starting fluid is too volatile all by itself, and will destroy
a diesel immediately. A more correct starting fluid for a diesel engine
would be WD-40 ! 
No, a diesel works by compressing air until it's hot enough to ignite
light oil, then injecting some. There is no fuel in the cylinder on the
compression stroke. 
You can use starting fluid on a diesel, but you must have a starting
fluid injection kit on the engine. Just squirting it into the air intake
from a can, like you do on a gas engine, will blow the engine up.
