My 72 has the same problem.  About every other year I take the faucet/pump
mechanism apart.  Be very careful not to lose the marble inside, and rub a
light amount of vegetable shortening on the inside of the pump and around
the rubber plunger inside.  Screw it all back together and it works just
fine.  If you use too much shortening, the first few cups of water will have
floaters in them.

&gt; Howdy Volks,

&gt; With the late models there is an electric pump and I guess the earlymodels
&gt; are manual.  Anyway, I can't seem to get the sink to work. It looks like
&gt; everything is hooked up properly, I put water in and went to
&gt; pumping..nothing happened..Any advice on how to make this thing work.
