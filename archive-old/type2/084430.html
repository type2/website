Subject: Re: [T2] Potential Trailer Hitch Info

oops, it's too early in the morning... Jamie's hitches are for 73-79
.....but he's still a nice guy.   Greg

Jim, i just ordered one of these from
http://www.globalserve_dot_net/~jrivers/hitch.htm =20

Jamie is a nice guy and the hitch is reasonably priced.  Greg

&gt;That sounds like just the hitch I would like to get. Does anyone know if it
&gt;is available or who sells a comparable one. I really like the idea of just
&gt;bolting it in place. Also I would be interested in seeing some pics of a
&gt;hitch installed.
