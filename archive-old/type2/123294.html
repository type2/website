Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon power outage... Urgent response required.

Greg,

My bet is a main connection somewhere around the ingition switch or
fuse box....in other words the main feed of power to the front.

Vanagon battery underneath the front passenger seat, right?

Look for a large red wire feeding the fuse box...we *are* assuming that 
the battery and such are ok since he drove it there a short time ago.

Dome light?  anything that doesn't work off of the ignition switch?

Not familiar with vanagons either...

Good luck, dave

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; My dad's out right now in his 81 Vanagon, and he has lost all 
&gt; electrical power. The lights, horn, and engine are all dead. He's on a 
&gt; client site and it was fine when he got there but won't go at all at 
&gt; the moment.
&gt; 
&gt; He has 2 batteries aboard, and both are well charged with clean 
&gt; connections and lots of available juice.
&gt; Thanks in advance,
