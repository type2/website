Subject: [T2] alternator light

Hi guys,
Yesterday when I went out to my bus about an hour after I last drove it
the
alternator light on the dash was glowing with the ignition off before I
put
the key in. After driving it was back to normal. Any suggestions, do I
have
a regulator on the way out?
Jeff
