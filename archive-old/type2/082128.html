Subject: Re: [T2] Electronic ignition opposed to points &amp; condenser

After reading all of the responses to your question, I thought would addmy 2 
cents.
I came up with the same question and after researching I decided to keep my 
points, BUT add a Universal CDI...I called universal and talked to the tech 
there because they make bothe a CDI and a Electronic Ignition. With the Tiger 
581 CDI, you gap your points at .016 , and gap your plugs at 46, and don't 
replace them for 50,000 miles...If the Cdi fails, you reverse the plug into 
the cdi and it reverts to the reg. ignition set up.  I picked up more takeoff 
power and 2 mpg.  I also added a hot start relay, and my bus starts with just 
a &quot;click&quot; of the key...never had that before...everytime. AND I added a SVDA 
Vacuum advance Dist....Man, I'm tellin ya with this combination on my 2ltr, 
it's smooth and powerful...and worth the $220 for everything.  Aircooled_dot_net 
has the distributers $120, Bus Depot has the relay $20, and Universal has the 
CDI $85.
