Subject: Re: Metal in Oil
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

When I bought my '76 Westy two years ago, the first
thing I did was change the oil, and I too, found
several chunks of what looked like aluminum foil,
one fairly large and some smaller ones. I figured I
must have a bearing thats toast. I've driven almost
4k miles since then,engine appears to be doing OK,
no knocking although it burns quite a bit of oil.
In the spring of '99 I'm going to pull this engine
and replace it with another one I have ( assuming
it lasts until spring). BTW, this engine is a GEX
rebuilt,( the letters GEX are stamped in the case)
which now has 74.5K on it, if PO is to be believed.
 If its still running when I pull it, I may offer to
sell it back to them, as this has to be a record for
one of their engines, as 3-5K seems to be the norm.
