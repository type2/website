Subject: Query - brake parts, '71

I know, I have a bad habit of asking questions before fully diagnosing the
problem, but I'm gonna do it again :)

The short version: I adjusted the rear brakes just before Jerome, and it
took a couple of turns of the stars to get the shoes where they should be.
Now, a month later, the brakes are way out of adjustment again, like the
rears are almost non-existant. I've got time off next week, so I'll be
tearing into the brakes and replacing the shoes, and I do have alternative
transportation in the meanwhile.

My musing -- I know that at least one of the little bits of spring steel
that attach to the block that the stars ride in is gone, and others are most
likely weak. I also know that these blocks are NLA.

What do you suppose the odds are that the stars have turned back in on their
own?
What are the parameters (years, models) of these star blocks, if I were to
try and track a pair down at the junk yard?
Are there any other work-arounds?

I'll let y'all know what I find when I take off the rear drums -- boy, do I
love those 2-piece drums! :)
