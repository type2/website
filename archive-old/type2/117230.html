Subject: [T2] Rear Window Defogger Grid

All of this rear window talk has me wondering something. Do you guys really
get fog on that window? I have never even used my defogger because that
window has never fogged up. Except that one night when my wife and I first
met... But seriously do you guys find you are missing this feature even in
the winter?
