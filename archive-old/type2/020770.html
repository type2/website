&gt; Today, he told me that the Georgia heat justifies permanently removing the
&gt; air control flaps.  Insisted, in fact.  He also indicated that the flaps
&gt; aren't too critical for warm-ups in the *reasonable* winters here...
&gt;
&gt; I've never heard this before, and I certainly don't remember seeing it in
&gt; Muir.  Does anyone have any perspective on this?
&gt;
&gt; Secondly, in looking at the diagram of the flaps in my official VW service
&gt; manual, I noticed something I'd never seen before: an &quot;air injection
&gt; pump,&quot; which was apparently driven by an extension to the fan pulley.

Justin:
RUN! Don't walk away from this guy! I think the air doesn't even go through
the oil cooler properly without the flaps in place. At any rate, it's only
slightly warmer in Georgia than in Germany, an insignificant number when you
consider thetempreature of the cylinder heads or the oil.
Who knows what other pseudo- science he subscribes to. Maybe torque the heads
twice as  tight so as to be better than the factory? I recently ran into a
fellow who believed exactly that! I wonde how many studs he's pulled!)
The air injector pump was a stop gap emissions fix to clean up the exhaust.
Just burned further in the exhaust. Rendered unnecessary by increased
precision of the fuel injection, which was introduced in 1975. In other words,
used only in 73 and 74, I believe.
