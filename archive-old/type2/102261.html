Subject: Re: gauge locations

From: Richard Atwell &lt;ratwell_at_mac_dot_com&gt;

&gt;instrument gauges to monitor oil temp, pressure etc. I'm looking for inventive installations...

I bought the black plastic 3-gauge pod that mounts on top of the dash and put it kinda on the left edge of the speaker holes, as close to the rear 
edge of the dash as it could go.  Ran one mounting screw and all wires thru speaker &quot;grill&quot; holes &amp; so only had to drill one mounting hole.

Looks huge at first but it isn't intrusive.  Very handy location for scanning the gauges.  In retrospect, centered over the speedo might be even better, 
but the pod is angled for mounting other than directly ahead of you.
