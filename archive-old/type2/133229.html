&gt; They have a lot of auto tranny parts and such for this bus

&gt; He's going to call and tell me whats wrong first. He said worst case
&gt; scenario $1000 canadian but shouldn't be over since he's got a lot
&gt; of the stuff around.

personally I wouldn't spend any where near that much on a 003 auto tranny
rather I would use the money to find a late 010 auto tranny from a 76+ bus
and put it in, and pay to fix it up. the 010 is a much tougher and easier
to fix auto tranny.
