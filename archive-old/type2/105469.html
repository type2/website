Just remove the spare from the tire well and let it sit flat on the floor.
Not a big deal, and it helps you get the plywood into the bus (that is a
really tight fit!)

&gt; the real reason my tire is on the front!
&gt;
&gt; besides I &quot;Like&quot; it there kinda neat looking IMO, first option I did to my
&gt; bus when I got it.   (it didn't have the VW emblem either)

I don't like front tire mounts because I've never seen one that hasn't
damaged the front of the bus in some way.  There are few pristine front
ends out there and a front tire mount just about guarantees that someone
is going to moosh in your front end while parking by braille.

BTW, if you carry sheet goods a lot, you can make hooks that slide into
the jack points.  These hold the sheet goods upright against the side of
the bus.  Tie-down straps attach to the hooks and extend up to hook over
the drip rail to secure the load.  Much more convenient than trying to fit
the sheets inside.
