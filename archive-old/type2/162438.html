&gt; Someone had an idea a while back to get an original AC setup, and
&gt; find a domestic alternator of the correct size to replace the AC
&gt; pump . That would give you a dual-alternator system and a LOT of
&gt; spare juice to run the AC.

I originally had an AC compressor on my bus so it had that second pulley
in front of the fan, I looked at using that to drive a second alternator
that was mounted where the old AC compressor hung.  the numbers never
really made it look like it was worth the work involved.  I haven't given
up on it but it is not on the front burner either.   would be interesting
if I could get an alt/motor in there and use the second battery to power
the motor for a little extra when I was starting up or needed a little
boost on a hill.

&gt; OTOH... converting rotational force into electrical energy that will
&gt; be used to spin a motor doesn't make sense to me. Too many
&gt; conversions wastes power, and there isn't all that much HP there to
&gt; start with.

always the details.
&gt;
&gt; One thing we haven't heard from Shad is what year bus he has.
&gt; Throwing that load at a stock early bay engine might be a wee bit
&gt; optimistic.

very optimistic

see you at JBB???
