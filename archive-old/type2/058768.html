Subject: Engine Hanger/Bearer

Kermarbah_at_aol_dot_com asked (in part)....
  While checking my &quot;new&quot; '68 bus, I noticed that the bolts (?) going
  through the engine bearer into the engine itself were missing.  Upon
  closer inspection, they have broken off in the engine case.  On top of
  this, the left one was put in using helicoil threads.  While researching
  this in the archives, I came across something called a &quot;Busmount Engine
  Adaptor&quot; - Bugpack part # 4538.  Is this something to convert other
  engines to a bus?  Can I use this to somehow attach the engine to the
  bearer?....

The adaptor is designed to retrofit Bug engines so that they'll accept the
bolts from the engine hanger in a Bus.  I think the device attaches to the
oil pump cover plate.  The problem is that the threaded ends of the adaptor
would be at the same spot as your now uselessly filled up bolt holes.
Seems to me that you would be better off grinding out the broken studs and
helicoling the three holes.  I don't think, but I could be wrong on this,
that there is a whole lot of stress placed on the three bolts so even a
helicoil set up would be enough to attach the engine to the carrier and
dampen the vibrations and torque.  I've known people to exist just fine
with just two bolts in.

But I wonder *why* all three might have snapped.  Seems pretty extreme.
Any history of rear-enders?
