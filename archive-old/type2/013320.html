There are two types of compression checks.
Hot , when the engine is still hot from being drive.
Cold, when the engine is cold from sitting overnight or cooled of
substantially after driving.
If you do a  hot compression check, remove all of the spark plugs, unplug
you coil wire, screw in the compression tester into a park plug hole.
Turn the engine over with the starter, possibly 30 second so you get
about six compression strokes. You can then read the compression on the
gauge.
If you do a cold compression check you can do everything the same way,
you can squirt some 30 Wt oil or whaterver oil you normally use into the
cylinder through the spark plug holes. I teaspoon is plenty. You'll
normally get a lower reading on a cold compression check.
You can rent a screw in compression tester at rental stores or buy one
for about $40.00 from Sears or other source.

If you have a 1970cc FI Aircooled:
130 or above HOT=Excellent
110 or 120 HOT= Very Good
90 to 100 HOT= Good
Anything below 90PSI is OK but you're not getting full performance and
probably heading for trouble.
I've seen engines that ran smooth and produce good power with 80 to 90
PSI, if you're in this range you need to have the cylinder compression in
very close range, not over 5PSI difference.
If you're getting readings within 5% of each other it is good.
Trouble spots are 10 to 20 PSI differences or any one or two cylinders
that are really low, like into the 50s or 60s.
Any reading below 90PSI is approaching marginal although you may get many
more miles out of your engine.
What causes low compression.
1. Normal wear
2. broken rings scored cylinders
3. split or cracked valves
4. loose valve seat
5. improperly adjusted valves
6. leaking head gasket


 Again I just purchased a 79 Bus and I would like to check the 
 compression.  
 I have seen it done, but I have never done it myself.  Are there any
