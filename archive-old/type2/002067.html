Well, as per Michael Wagner's recommendation, I got a Bosch WR-15 low
voltage relay kit form The Bus Depot (after figuring out exactly what it was
called, initially they couldn't come up with the part based on my
description of it and/or the problem). I installed it last night and it
works great and it still worked this AM!! Also it was the easiest electrical
problem I have ever dealt with, though it is a &quot;band aid&quot; fix! Thanks to
Michael and all who gave me advice on this problem.
