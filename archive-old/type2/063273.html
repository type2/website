Subject: VW Campers called Profis?

hey now,

i was talking to a coworker and he said when he went to see the dead in
germany there were many aircooled campers called Profis? anyone know anything
about these? he said they looked 'cooler' then the vans important to the US.
i'd like to hear about them.

thanks,


jonathan
