&gt;Not us. We buy buses that mostly run and we try to keep them mostly

hey, i resemble that remark! i actually did do all the brakes and 
rear bearings a few weekends ago, and then went up a mountain and 
camped out at jerome, az.  i DID find that i didn't bleed all the 
brakes as much as i could have - made the drive home down a 
narrow-gauge railway bed sorta fun :)  nothing dangerous, just a 
slightly spongy pedal.

however, to get it all done in time, i was up to 4 am three days 
running. and i even had all the correct drifts, etc for the bearing 
work... otherwise i might have been stopped cold. the secret to 
busloops is to realize that once you are in there, FIX IT ALL. if you 
are prepared mentally and parts-wise - and focus on ONE system -  it 
isn't so bad. try not to think about adding that new stereo while 
building a new bottom end!
