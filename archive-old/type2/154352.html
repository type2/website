I guess I might be jaded... normally I would completely agree with you. But, 
I have to keep reminding myself that I live in South Florida. It's a 
completely different environment than where I've lived elsewhere, like the 
D.C. Metro Area, or other conservative areas like Connecticut and 
Massachusettes (conservative in terms of automobiles and livestyles).

Here in South Florida, I literally cannot drive a mile down the road without 
seeing at least 2-3 Hummer H2s. I'm now seeing Hummer H3s everywhere. It's 
not uncommon to see Bentleys and whatever else. Cadillacs aren't even 
considered fancy cars down here as that's like a typical vehicle that people 
drive. When I see the number of Escalades, Hummers, and BMWs... I consider 
the fact that there ARE markets where cars such as a modern VW Bus might be 
a popular car. The new FJ Cruiser from Toyota just came out a month or two 
ago. I see them all over the place here in Florida. I used to think I was 
special because I had a Pontiac Solstice and now every neighborhood has at 
least 1 or 2. I am convinced that a modern VW Bus would sell well. Perhaps 
not in places like Brookfield Missouri.... but in Fort Lauderdale, Dallas / 
Fort Worth / LA... places like that.. I can totally see it.

Many people drive SUVs simply because they don't like the somewhat boring 
stereotype that minivans give. There are many of us (myself included) who 
simply would rather die young than have to live a life driving boring every 
day cars. People want unique cars. People have their reasons... either it's 
to stand out, self image, or because of the excitement and simple pleasure 
they get from driving a car that's unique. I'd be willing to bet that most 
of the people who drive modern Beetles now, never had one before.... but 
they like the fact that it's a uniquely styled car. My wife has a VW Beetle 
Convertible, and never had one in the 70s.. (well... she was too young to 
have owned an original beetle anyway). For the same reason that people would 
buy a new Beetle, I think people would buy a new Bus. And, it doesn't 
necessarily HAVE to be 40 grand either.

Unique cars don't necessarily have to come with a hefty price tag. I drove 
my Solstice off the dealer lot with a final price tag of $22,900.

&gt;
&gt; Sad to say, but the chances of a New Bus that will satisfy us aircooled
&gt; addicts is slim.  Economy, safety, and production costs will make anything
&gt; with a &quot;bus look&quot; more expensive than purpose-built minivans.
