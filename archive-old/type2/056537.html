Subject: Unidentified subject!

&gt;I have a 1981 Westfalia I acquired recently, and it has a serious hot start
&gt;problem.
&gt; ...
&gt;wired in a
&gt;Bosch relay as explained in these mailing lists and various documents on the
&gt;web.
&gt;
&gt;Result: I still have a hot start problem.

Okay, I'm having a warm start problem, and I was just talking it over
with a friend.  He suggested, &quot;Find out where the voltage drop is&quot;.
With a voltmeter, make sure you're getting close to 12 volts across
the Bosch relay, and at the solenoid, and at the starter.

If you're dropping a lot of voltage before you get to the relay, it's
in the ignition switch or the wiring to/from the switch.

That's one thing to check.
Rodney
