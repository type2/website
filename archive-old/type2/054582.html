for the time being, wrap the fuel hose and filter in aluminum foil; it
should make the symptoms go away.

However, you should check the condition of the engine cooling seals (rear
seal, plug seals, etc), heater hoses, etc. Holes in these places will
skyrocket your engine temps, and your incidence of vapor lock (what you are
experiencing).
