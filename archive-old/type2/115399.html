Subject: upcoming BNNTA #19 event...

Hi everyone,

Well, things are progressing nicely for the &quot;Busses Nowhere Near The Arch #19&quot;
VW camping event coming up in a week and a half from now.  The trophies are
ready for pick-up and we got the Mapquest link functioning again on the web
site, so if you need directions, just open up the link to the close-up map.
The red pin is positioned right on the &quot;group use&quot; campground in the Indian
Creek Recreation Area right on Mark Twain Lake, which is about 30 miles west
of Hannibal, MO.  I've leased the entire group use campground again so that we
can pack it with VW's and all enjoy our privacy from the rest of the holiday
camping crowd.  There will be another large Saturday caravan on scenic back
roads over to Hannibal, MO to visit Mark Twain's hometown and it's historic
sights.  I'm already starting to load up the BNNTA event truck (an original
paint, low mileage Sealing Wax Red '59 Double-Door Panel) with all the event
supplies, as well as a nice supply of various parts and tools just in case
anyone limps into the event.  The e-mails and phone calls are picking up as
usual, and we're getting excited to see all of our new and old VW friends and
their Busses for the long Labor Day weekend!  We hope to see some of you for
the festivities very soon!
