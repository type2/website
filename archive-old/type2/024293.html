&gt; I'd heard we got stuck with the dog because the Fed insisted that we have a
&gt; vac advance dizzy for some obscure possibly corrupt reason.
&gt; 
&gt; What did the European versions come stock with...anyone?????

 Vacuum advance.

 I think you're thinking of the dizzy's with vacuum retard as well as 
advance: they may have been a US emmissions fitment.

 As I understand it you need some spark advance to get proper combustion
at low revs with wide open throttle (makes sense- there's more to burn).
 A centrifugal dizzy can't do that, so the bus bogs and hesitates as you
try to pull away.
 With the stock setup on my '77 (dual carbs, vacuum advance dizzy) I can
floor the throttle at 1200rpm or so in top and the bus will pull away
smoothly and strongly. No hesitation, no misfiring, no clutch slipping
and no revving the engine like a hooligan to get torque.

Cheers,
	W.
PS Anyone care to bet when we'll get the first newbie asking how to put
a Honda S2000 engine in a bus? :-) After all, it makes 240bhp...
