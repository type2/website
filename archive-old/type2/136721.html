Subject: Re: [T2] is my mechanic full of it?

&lt;Any ideas?  I need to know if I can trust this guy.  He also told me to rip off the thermostat and flaps, by the way, that the engine would run better without them....&gt;

You might be able to trust him (he charges a fair price and does good work) but he is sadly misinformed/uninformed. You need each and every piece VW built the car with. It is ALL there for a reason. 

Without the flaps life is fine for a while but the engine will never last as long when the temps can't stablize, or it can't warm up during short trips. Also your heater may not put out as much heat. 

The dune buggy guys might rip out all the unecessary parts but those of us that are running on the street seeking durability and heat need all the pieces - flappers, all the rubber seals, everything adjusted right. The dune buggy guys prob don't last more than a few seasons before they kill the chassis, kill the engine, or get bored with their critter and sell it so durability (100K miles durability) is prob not a huge concern. They prob just want cheap to fix.
