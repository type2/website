Hi, I recently bought a 74 Riviera in Juarez, Mexico. I live in Colorado.
I have driven the van while I was down there and it &quot;seems&quot; to run fine. I
have to go down and pick it up soon but i have a dilemma.

The more I research the things (this is my first aircooled VW) the more I
find out how easy it is to fry the engine. Since I won't have time to
check the valves and other &quot;crucial things&quot; while I am down there, would
it be much wiser for me to pull it on the 10 hour (probably 15 with the
bus) journey back to where I live. Or, if I check the oil and drive it
like a baby back, would that be ok. Thanks ahead for the advice!

roger
