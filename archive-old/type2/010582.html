Subject: TC bolts - the hole!!!
Message-ID: &lt;19991110195947.10694.qmail_at_aw162_dot_netaddress_dot_usa_dot_net&gt;

Okay, am i crazy or were you guys talking about removing the torque converter
from the flexplate mounted to the crank?  The hole in the case on the upper
left towards the front - thats what its for - removing TC bolts.  Did i miss
something?

&gt; I loosen the engine and pull it back about a half inch so there is a small
