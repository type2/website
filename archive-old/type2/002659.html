&gt;Question is: How do you install test things? There are no bolts or clips.
Do
&gt;they mount on the inside or outside?


There should be a groove running around the frames.  It just snaps into the
front, inside of the window frame on each side.  Don't force them in or out
though as one of mine snapped that way. Ok now that I think about it, do you
have the sliding windows or the jalousy kind? Those instructions are for the
sliding kind.
