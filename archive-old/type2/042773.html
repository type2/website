Subject: A Friday relativity physics question:

I'd had my bus a few years before I noticed that the speedometer goes down only 
as far as 10 mph, then stops on the pin - there is no 0 mph.   Up till now 
that's only been an interesting theoretical problem - instantaneous acceleration 
to 10 mph? some kind of warp effect caused by the old 1600 engines? - but now 
it's become something . . . darker.  

I just moved to a condo complex, with a big sign full of do's and don't's posted 
at the main entrance - noise, vandalism, parking in reserved spots, etc.  And it 
also clearly states:  Maximum speed limit 5 mph.  

Well, you can see the problem.  My bus is going twice that, right now, just 
sitting there at home in its parking spot while I'm here at work.  Despite the 
owners association's preoccupation with rules it's a pretty nice complex and I'd 
hate to be forced to move out because of this.

Any advice would be most welcome.

worriedly,

Bill
