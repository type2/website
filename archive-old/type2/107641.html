Subject: Re: [T2] Cabin Insulation

I installed new floor and sub floor in my 73 last summer.
I used a special insulation material I got at home depo.  It is basicaly
bouble rap with tin foil on both sides, and I think it works really well.

The store has all the literature about its R values and all I remember now
is that is was the most effective I could find for this application,  Plus
it doe snot absorbe moisture.

Regards, ANdrea
