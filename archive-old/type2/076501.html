who the heck knows for sure exactly what the mileage is on MOST of these
buses.  unless you owned it or have records for it's entire life it is
almost always a guess.  I say mine has 305k on it, but I can only verify
105k mysel, but I base it on &quot;good guessing&quot; but it could have sat and
only be 205k or maybe it was driven hard and has 405k...once it passes
100k the mileage has very little effect on value, condition is far far
more important.

&gt; I just moved to the US and picked my Bus up in Baltimore. It needed to 

are you still in Baltimore?? 

&gt; be insured so we added it as a second vehicle to my girlfriends 
&gt; insurance, for now. I am very suprised to see that I'm only insured 
&gt; for 15K here and 15K there, it's like driving around with no insurance 

that is a mandated minimum, extra is very inexpensive, I have mine insured
for a million and I think it added $38 a year to the premium

&gt; Needless to say, I'm worried about someone running into my Bus in 
&gt; some way. Isn't it so, that if it is values by an approved company, 
&gt; to a certain value, that the insurance has to treat it as if it 
&gt; was a 1999 car with a certain &quot;blue book&quot; value? I would greatly 
&gt; appreciate any info on how to insure a Bus in the US, in such a way 

all offers are just that &quot;offers to settle&quot; you don't have to accept them
and really shouldn't negotiate.

&gt; I won't be paying someone's wheel chair the rest of my life (fingers 
&gt; crossed), or loose my investment in case some uninsured driver runs 
&gt; into it. 

Maryland (and most other states) include &quot;uninsured insurance&quot; on your
policy so if you get hit by someone with no insurance , your company pays
you...

&gt; All that said, there is no way an insurance company could -really- 
&gt; 'undo' the damage to my Bus, it would just never be the same. 

how very true
