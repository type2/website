Subject: Re: [T2] Blowby -

&gt;a while ago steve dolan theorized that this is caused by worn valve
&gt;guides.


Thanks, Andy, I really believe I have worn valve guides, allowing some 
pressure to build up into the head/valve cover area.

But is there some PCV type thing or orafice that gets the blowby from the 
heads to the crank case??  Isn't there something that would return the oil 
from the valve cover area back to the crank case??

I also have pressure in the crank case that is blowing oil out the breather 
hose.  I agree, Karl, probably bad rings there, but I was wondering if there 
is some mechanism to get the head blowby back to the crank case, instead of 
pushing against my push rod tube seals.

I would like to go 65 MPH as a passing speed, but I can't go that fast for 
very long.  70 MPH is bye-bye seals time...  With my '78 running as well as 
it is, that is a  speed that I could inattentively approach.

Thanks.
