Rick Bailey sends:

&gt; Some shoddy wiring (around the radio only) is the one kludge I indulge
&gt; myself in. Soldering proper connectors and so forth is just more work that I
&gt; think the radio is worth, when twisting wires together and covering them up
&gt; with masking tape does the job just fine. I keep telling myself &quot;next time
&gt; it's warm, I'll solder them proper.&quot;

Covering them up with electrical tape (they have it at the dollar store) is
better and takes no more work.
