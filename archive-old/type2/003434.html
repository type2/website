Subject: tent thanks and horn

Hi Again,

First, thanks to everyone for the tent info.  I think I will probably go
with one of the newer ones - mostly because of the weight &amp; complicated set
up of the originals.  But I like the way the older ones look much more than
the ones on eurocampers.  Loved the ones on &quot;Joe's Tent Page&quot;!  Will
probably wait a bit now that I know they are available.  Maybe they will
change style /colors before next spring.  Either way, I'll have a tent for
the next season.

So, now that I am so pleased with the tent info, I started to try to do the
horn myself.   (PO and ugly horn button ).  Took off the black cap on the
steering wheel.  Proud of myself for figuring out it was the black cap cause
previous people had gouged and cracked the steering wheel trying to get at
the horn.  (Think I would like to get a new wheel)  Anyway, question is,
under the black button, there is the brown wire which just stops - it is not
connected to anything.  Are there other pieces that should be there that are
missing?

Thanks,

Lori
