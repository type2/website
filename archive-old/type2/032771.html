sorry to bother you, but I´m not sure who can help me with my question:
I have a 1973 westfalia, 2,000 c.c engine.
Last weekend I went to a place named melgar that it is about 3 hours from bogota (i´m located in colombia) when I was going there I had no problem with my engine. temp was between (180-220 degrees aprox) it went up sometimes but nothing to worry about.
when I was returning to bogota the trip is mostly up hill and my engine was trying to run hoter than normal, and it got almost to 260 degrees, so I had to stoptwice to let the engine cool .
I was reading the page about cooling at http://www.type2_dot_com/library/cooling/coolsami.htm and things seems to be ok.
the only think that is wrong is that the the aux heater fan is not ducted to the engine. so I´m thinking to seal completly that system cause I think I´m recicling hot air..
also I want to install a aditional oil cooling system.

my main quiestions are?
is it normal to get to that temperature going up in long hills??
any sugestions ??
any special model of oil cooler???
If you can help me, I really apreciate it, if not, please let me know who can help me.

thanx
