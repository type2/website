Don't bother. There ia an easy, easy way of doing this.

You need about two feet of vacuum hose in the size to fit over the
nipple of the brake wheel cylinder and a clean empty brake fluid can. 

1) Loosen/open the brake cylinder bleeder valve on the farthest wheel
from the master cylinder if bleeding all four wheels, otherwise just
open the one you're working on.  Keep it open.

2) Slip one end of a vacuum hose over the nipple of the bleeder valve
and the other end into a clean brake fluid can placed on the ground
under the wheel. The can should have about two inches of brake fluid in
it and the end of the hose in and under the fluid level.

3) Make sure the master cylinder is full and fill it after each two or
three pumps of the brake pedal. Keep it full.

4) With your hand or foot, slowly depress the brake pedal to the floor
three times. Fill the master cylinder again.

5) Repeat again if needed and as many time as you want to flush all the
brake line with new brake fluid.

6) Close the valve and do the next wheel in the same way.

7) After several pumps you will have to empty the can under the wheel.

8) Do all the wheels as needed.

The can and hose under the wheel will keep the cylinder from sucking
back air. Be careful not to let the master cylinder go empty. This
procedure uses more brake fluid than the master cylinder can hold.

&gt; I am looking at the &quot;one-man brake bleeder&quot; in the RMMW catalog ($34.95)
&gt; and thinking that it is doubtless way overpriced. It's a vacuum pump,
&gt; isn't it? With a reservoir on the business end for checking bubbles?
&gt; 
&gt; I am guessing that by squeezing the handle, brake fluid is drawn out of
&gt; the cylinder, bringing any bubbles with it. The air bubbles pass into the
&gt; pump reservoir and exit through a break in the pipe (the break is
&gt; submerged in brake fluid).
&gt; 
&gt; Have I got it right? Because if I do, some clear hose, a jelly jar, and
&gt; one of those pumps that fits on a drill chuck (8.95) will do the same job.
