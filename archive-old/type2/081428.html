Subject: [T2] carbs leaking?


&gt; hi everyone...workin on my buddies type4 73transporter. he just put in a
tranny and we're tryin to get his dual carbs set up now. we both have very
little knowledge of workin on carburators. so we could use a little help.
&gt; he has dual solex34 on it. and where we're currently having problems, is
with a gas leak, we believe, to be coming from the linkage out of the front
of the throttle body.
&gt; when we had it started,the idle was real low, and we were not able to get
it adjusted with the idle screw.
&gt; but now that we've noticed this gas leak, we are definately hesitant to
start her back up before we figure out why it's leaking.
&gt; any help that u can pass our way, would of course, be much appreciated.
&gt; *shine on* -Chris
