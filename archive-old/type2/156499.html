Subject: Re: running hot update

LOL daniel nope... but was adding to it...
  the condensor affects points which affect dwell which  affect timing... and within all that there can be lots of problems... not to mention all the holes i had in the engine bay compartment that also was adding to the problems of not cooling right....not my fault will blame on all the rust.... my bus is riding on time with her badly rusted body covered over with a rattle can....but shes mechanically good from what shes been through and i gave her a little longer of living instead of sitting in that field she was in...hehehehe
   
  so no condensor wasnt the whole problem but wasnt helping...
  it was buring my points up to fast adding a tit to them....
   
  we will now see what happens next few hot days if she still wonts to act right or not... will check dwell again also reguarly to see if dwell stays decently where i set it at...
   
  the only problem knock on wood LOL i think is going on now is the stuttering and not wanting to shut off like a old t model would do only when she is shut off after runnning during the hot hours of the day....
   
  i have a new carb here i might try and see if that helps...?
   
  hope so....
  thanks for asking... hope i cleared that up... 
   
  peace and thanks
