Subject: FS: Ambulance fans, and NEW flywheel

I have a set of these fans in my collection that I'm not likely to use
soon, and need some cash to replace the cabinetry on my Vanagon Westy
project following a small fire...

They're complete with the switch and wiring...

Please make me an offer off line...to save bandwidth..

Also have a NEW 215mm type IV flywheel, still in the cosmoline if anyone
wants that at a reasonable price.

Den.
