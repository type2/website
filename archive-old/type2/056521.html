Once again, after a full day of trying to start my recalcitrant rebuilt
1600DP, I appeal to the list for aid.  Last time on this!  I promise!  }:) 


Earlier today saw me jumping up and down in the driveway and frothing at
the mouth, after the engine *Just* *Barely* refused to turn over.  Yelling
things like:  &quot;I'm *THIS* close!  --&gt;| |&lt;--  Even closer!  Like,
feeler-gauge close!  Like mis-adjusted valve close! 
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!&quot;

But I've calmed down since then.  8)  Really.  

I've got perfectly-adjusted and pumped-up hydraulic valves (1 turn in). 
I've got a brand-spanking-rebuilt distributor just-in to replace the faulty
one (stripped points-setting screw, d'oh!).  Points set at .016&quot;.  The
spark plug wires have been sextuple-checked.  I've got gas coming from the
fuel pump to the carb (more on that later), and I've got spark at the
plugs.  

After Ron Van Ness and I set the engine's end play correctly (now *that*
was an allnighter from hell), the sucker cranks over like a happy puppy
chasing after a ball; fast and enthusiastic.  At first, it was just
cranking over, no ignitions.  Then I advanced the timing a tad, tightened
all the connections at the coil, readjusted the valves.  Now, it cranks
over and catches, dies, catches, dies, catches, catches, dies.  

*Just* not enough!  I tested my spark; it's strong at the coil and the
plugs.  (took a plug out, attached to the wire, grounded it against a
shrouding bolt, and cranked the engine over a few full revolutions;
spark-spark-spark, on schedule.  nice and blue-white.)  Did an experiment;
cranked the engine while pumping the gas like I was gonna flood it, ran
back to the engine and unscrewed a plug, sniffed... no gas smell.  Plug
wasn't wet.  


So my problem seems to be that there isn't enough fuel reaching the
combustion chamber.  Yes?  


Now, I cranked the engine over a few revolutions (using the starter, not by
hand), while holding the business-end of the fuel pump hose at a little
cup; got two or three moderately solid gouts into the cup, so that settled
my mind on the fuel pump... but now I'm wondering something:

How much fuel is supposed to come out of that pump with every revolution of
the crank?  (I think it's every revolution; that's how it looks on the
distributor drivegear camlobe, but my memory could be faulty.  Every
half-revolution?)  Anyway, with every squirt, how much should be coming
out?  


If there's enough fuel coming out of the pump, should I adjust the carb's
mixture?  Lean it out?  Richen it?  


Sorry to keep bugging the list about this, but... but... I'm so *close*!

TIA for anything,
