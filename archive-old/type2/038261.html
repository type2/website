Why would you fix smoke in the cabin?  I thought that was a special VW
feature.  Hey mom, check out the pretty colors.....  : )

&gt; find out why oil is in your heat exchangers... (pushrod tube seals? valve
cover
&gt; gaskets?) and then fix that...and let the rest of the oil burn off...thats
what
&gt; I did.

And disconnect the accordeon tubes so the smoke doesn't enter the cabin...
