&gt; I'd like to utilize the entire assembly. Question: I've got a heavy duty two

&gt; puller on the pitman arm/drag link connection but it's got a &quot;lot&quot; of tension
&gt; on
&gt; it...Can/should I use it to disconnect this fitting or should I go further
&gt; back and
&gt; pull the pitman arm off the steering box...

You can do that, but first try the 2-hammer method.  With the puller in
place, put one hammer against the side of the pitman arm and give the
other side a whack with a lighter hammer.  The direction of the impact
should be perpendicular to the tapered stud of the rod end.  The idea is
to &quot;oval&quot; the hole microscopically and pop things loose.  It works for me!
