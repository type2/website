Subject: Sump plate was Re: Hi

&gt; I'm somewhat confused by your question. the VDO oil sump sender is
&gt; usually installed in the sump plate. This is located at the rear
&gt; passenger side of the engine. It's a metal plate held on by 2 small
&gt; bolts and about 80mm dia. A hole is drilled &amp; the sender unit
&gt; installed in this hole. this leaves the drain hole functional. It's
&gt; not exactly what you're asking, but I think this is what you are
&gt; wanting to know.

I just noticed this plate because it has a rubber seal and there is an oil
leak now. It is for inspection purposes?

How often, is this seal supposed to be replaced?
