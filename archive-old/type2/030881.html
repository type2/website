&gt; I'd like to pretend that I used my gigantic brain to figure this out, but truth is that I just stumbled upon a very easy way to bleed the hydraulic lifters. I was doing the pan-full-of-oil thing, pressing down on the lifter for 30 seconds to get maybe 3 or 4 bubbles out of it. VERY tedious and time-consuming.
&gt; 
&gt; It took me 30 minutes to bleed 2 lifters the old way; it took less than 20 minutes to bleed the remaining six the new way.
&gt; 
Day late and a dollar short, just finished bleeding the buggers the old
way about two weeks ago *&amp;^%#%* where were you when I needed this idea??

it goes in the old &quot;Save&quot; file for the next time, THanks
