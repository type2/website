Subject: re:To use Thermostat or not?

I suggest you DON'T use a thermostat. Especially if you live anywhere near
Arkansas. I need a good steady supply of bus parts...or maybe I can sell
you a good, used engine case.

Okay, that was pretty SMART remark, but I was in that mood. I think the
bottom line is this: thermostats are cheap; engines are expensive. 
Thermostats are an essential part of the engine's cooling system. This
from a novice who trusts Bob Hoover and Tom Wilson.
