Thanks, Al

No Bentley, yet.  Back ordered from Amazon
apparently.  I was supposed to have it already,
but I haven't even received the confirmation that
they shipped.  I'm using the Haynes TypeIV
specific (72-79 bus) but it refers to some
&quot;electronic device&quot; that attaches and determines
TDC from the flywheel.  Not real helpful.  Muir
(as edited by somebody else or Muir from beyond
the grave) mentions that the flywheel will have
the timing scale on it, which mine doesn't.  

Even when my scale arrives from TBD, how do I
know where to mount it?
