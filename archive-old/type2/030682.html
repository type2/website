Death?  A little extreme, I would say.

do you have a stock-style muffler?  Single tailpipe off to the driver
side, blah blah?  Or an aftermarket extractor?  Or Pon-forbid! A bug
muffler?

Anyhow.  If you have a Liestriz (yes, I spelled it wrong.:) stock muffler,
it will be vvery obvious which is which, since the tubes on these are
correctly built.

One side has a tube that sorta points TOWARD the engine, (that is, inside
the exhaust work...) and that end is getting the exhaust.  The other end
leads to the expansion chamber of the exhaust system, and exists there.
High pressure at one end, low at the other, allows the exhaust to travel
correctly.

George Lyle...you have one laying around, right? Take a look, tell us
which end has the small hole in the top, and which has the large hole?

Stock bug mufflers should be similar, as well as decent aftermarket
stock-style mufflers.

Aftermarket extractors, OTOH, just have holes into the header tubes, if
youare lucky.  Most have the holes blocked off!

In this case, it doesnt matter which side you put the small one on, but
you still should use one small, and one large one.  the way these are
designed (or not...), it allows equal pressure into each end of the
preheater tube, so that there is no FLOW, since each side's pressure keeps
the other side from moving....

If you use a small one one end, it should allow that end to have less
inward pressure, and let the other end push the air through.

My thoughts and opinions..;p
