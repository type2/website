Hey Ron:

Their reputation is that they have the same tendancy to drop valve seats (or
worse, depending on who you ask; see the archives) as the original VW ones
did.

Can these heads be shot peened or whatever AVP does to help prevent dropped
seats?  The advantage would be that you heve new heads; no cracks or welds.

What do these heads cost?
