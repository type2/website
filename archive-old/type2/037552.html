&gt;When I realized that ALL my local flaps now carried nothing but GL5 tranny
&gt;oil, I went on a panicky search at the local wholesalers... almost bought a
&gt;120lb KEG of GL4!
&gt;
&gt;When I finaly found a wholesaler who still had it in buckets, a man behind
&gt;the counter came over to talk; he had heard me asking for ANY tranny fluid
&gt;that WAS NOT GL5 :)!
&gt;
&gt;First words outta his mouth:  &quot;Do you drive an Audi or a Volkswagen?&quot;  He
&gt;was a Pennzoil engineer; he also said &quot;Yeah, he can't use any stuff with
&gt;Pennzane&quot; while explaining to the clerks.
&gt;
&gt;Pennzane is Pennzoil's name for whatever chemical it is that makes a tranny
&gt;oil 'Limited Slip.' Which is waht GL5 is. He specifically stated that the
&gt;gears in Audis and VWs were harmed by this, and they were still getting
&gt;back reports on other makes - my old Chevy MIGHT be safe. He recommends
&gt;never using Limited Slip formulations on any manual made before 1995, just
&gt;to be sure.
&gt;
&gt;Pennzoil's GL3 'Synchromesh' lube even says &quot;safe for yellow metals on the
&gt;bottle&quot; so they've known about it for a while.........
&gt;
&gt;Just thought I'd post some solid info; this isn't one of those natural vs
&gt;synthetic oil, or boxers vs briefs kinda things - GL5 will eat your tranny!

Yellow Metal?

Way back when I was in the Navy I remember our snipes talking about 
problems with cadmium coated metal, which had a yellow tint, and 
petroleum products. For a time cadmium coated fasteners were being 
used as a replacement for stainless steel and other corrosion 
resistant metals, price being the driving factor. However, there was 
a toxic gas or something being produced when the cadmium fasteners 
came in contact with hot oil so they were banned from the propulsion 
spaces, we still used them up on deck. I wonder if there is something 
similar going on in our trannies.
