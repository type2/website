Subject: engine update

hey type2 listees well here is a engine update i spoke
to the bob at boston engines and he told me that he
was wraping up a engie in front of mine and he is
getting to mine next. So by early next month my engine
will be finish in the mean time what i am doing to my
bus while she is sitting there. I took all my engine
tin down to the metal shop and had it sandblasted and
powder coated just got that back. Wed i picked up my
rims and brought them down to get sandblasted and
powdercoated silver again and getting new tires at the
same time. I had my mechanic pull my gas tank out to
get it lined and i found 30 year old dust on it that
was cool and i found out my tank was no useable but
her told me he had a tank that he lined and it was in
excellent shape so i am going to buy that off him. At
the same time he recemmend that i replace my fuel
sending unit which i am goiong to do. In my engine
copartment i have some area that are rusted so i am
going to go down there with some new reef blue pain
sand them down and repaint them if anyone has any
suggestions how to do that i would be grateful well
happy driving 

sincerely sam
