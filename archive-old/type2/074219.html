sounds like an AFM problem, check the plug on the back of the Air Flow
Meter it could be working loose.

see that the flappper inside is moving freely.

there is fairly long segment in archives on checking the PC trace in the
AFM which occasionally wear out.

&gt; Made my maiden voyage in this one about a week ago including stop and go
&gt; traffic and about 8 miles each way at 75 mph.  The bus did fine.
&gt; 
&gt; I was really excited about getting a christmas tree with it on Saturday
&gt; morning, but got about 5 miles down the road and it died....not all the
&gt; way though.  It would idle fine, but if you tried to give it any
&gt; accelerator pedal, it would die....and then restart just fine.
&gt; 
&gt; It felt like I was running out of gas, it would idle(just ok), but if I
&gt; tried to give it any accelerator at all it just bogged.  I parked it for
&gt; about and hour and then went back with some gas(I really didn't think that
&gt; was it).  I drove it around the park a little and it did just fine.
&gt; 
&gt; So, I went back about 2 hours later to drive it back home and it did just
&gt; fine for about 2 miles and then started the same behavior.  I could
&gt; actually leave it at idle and limped about another 1/2 mile to park it
&gt; again.
&gt; 
&gt; To make a long story short, it seems to be heat related.  I fired it up on
&gt; Sunday morning(23 degrees) and let it idle for about 20 minutes.  Timing
&gt; and dwell are exactly right on.  A vacuum gauge on the distributor shows a
&gt; nice steady reading at any rpm above idle.  After about 30 minutes of
&gt; idling, the problem was back.  If you try to move the accelerator, it has
&gt; nothing.  The vacuum gauge just starts to move when this happens, but then
&gt; no vacuum.  
&gt; 
&gt; It is as if when it gets warmed up, it has a massive manifold leak at
&gt; anything over idle.  I did not have time to check anything else yet.
&gt; 
&gt; The decel valve is still in place and I am wondering if the diaphram on it
&gt; has developed some sort of leak or tear.  Is it really necessary?
&gt; 
&gt; The only changes I made on Fiday were to hold the right side heater flap
&gt; open(new cable coming) and to install the new tin that protects the push
&gt; rod tubes.  I already had a new engine seal in place.  Remember that this
&gt; car had been sitting for 8 years, but now has rebuilt injectors, pressure
&gt; control valve and cold start valve.  Lots(if not all) vacuum and other
&gt; hoses had already been replaced.
&gt; 
&gt; Any comments or suggestions would be appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers, dave
