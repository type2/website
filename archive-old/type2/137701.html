Subject: Re: [T2] Heater linkages

I've done too many different years of buses and vanagons. If yours is
like the one I remember, there is a valve under the floor that opens
the vent at the lip at the front of the cargo area, just behind the
front seats. Look under the bus for a large round duct feeding this
vent with a cable activated valve. It is easy for this to get corroded
from exposure to the elements. You may be able to free it up with some
kind of spray product.

Good luck!

John

 That probably means that I have a heat exchanger that isn't closing to the
 system when I use the lever, and some misdirected air up front.
 
 I can see the footwell cable, but the other is the broken one.  Do you know
 what the left-most cable does when the it's in the fully open (the lever is
 down) position?  I want the air up front and in the defrosters.  I don't
 need to heat the rear area.
