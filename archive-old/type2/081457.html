Subject: Re: [T2] clutch problem

I believe Steve is correct. Up to 70 [end of?], the trans does not have the
tube on the input shaft. On these transaxles you must use a pressure that has
a ring mounted on it for the throw-out bearing to ride on.
If he put a 71 and up pressure plate in, he will have a large gap between the
throw-bearing and the pressure plate that he cannot adjust out.

H.P., does the pressure plate you installed have a ring on it in the center at
the end of the fingers?

If no: No amount of washers will help this problem. The ring centers the
bearing. You will destroy the bearing and the new pressure plate if you leave
this mis-matched combo in the bus.

&gt; &gt; I think you have achieved clutch-trans mismatch. Despite the bolt holding
&gt; &gt; the flywheel to the crank, it is really part of the transmission, not the
&gt; &gt; engine. Your flywheel, pressure plate, and clutch disc must match the
&gt; &gt; *transmission*!  Use the ones that came with it and you will have no
&gt; &gt; problems, use a mismatched set and you will.
&gt;
&gt; since we are I think talking early loaf here the mixed up options do not
&gt; occur as with later asst trannys. The clutch disc and throwout DO have
&gt; to match though. I think rather that his clutch cable may be just a bit
&gt; too long which, if you check the archives, seems to be not that uncommon.
&gt; The prevailing solution is washers under the wingnut.
&gt; Easier to try this first before pulling the engine back out which he can
&gt; always do later if the washers dont help.
