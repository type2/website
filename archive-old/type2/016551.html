Subject: Final Attempt

This is my last attempt at finding that bus I want so badly.  I want any
year Westy that is air cooled. (68-83).  I need the bus to be in very
good body shape and good interior shape.  Engine does not matter.  It
does not have to be running and can even have no engine.  SO if you live
in New England and can help me please email me.

PS- I have a mint 89 Jeep Wrangler that I would be willing to trade or I
can pay cash.

Thanks,
Matthew
