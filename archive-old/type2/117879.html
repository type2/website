Subject: Re: [T2] VW crash testing?

Here is a pic of a bus my dad was hit by a drunk driver in about
1976:

http://128.208.99.42/vw/crunch-bus.jpg

He was going about 20 MPH and was hit by a drunk going about 35 MPH in a
big american car.  Severely fractured his left leg in several places.  No
injury to the drunk.
