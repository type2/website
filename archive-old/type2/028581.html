I bought a Type 4 camshaft as an &quot;NOS&quot; part recently. It's the one that had a loose cam gear. I decided to tighten the rivets on this thing, since it was new and would give me longer service.

Then, in looking at Wilson, page 97, he shows a wear pattern and says that a depression at the top of the camshaft means that the camshaft is not an acceptable core. SHIT! I've got this same pattern on the cosmolene-covered camshaft I just bought!

Would somebody who knows please confirm or refute: Do the Type 4 camshafts come with a little rectangular depression on top of the middle 2 lobes, or is this the tell-tale sign that I, a novice to Type 4's have been screwed by someone passing used parts off as NOS?

Thanks! Joe
