Dustin,

You didn't say if you were rebuidling yourself and the $900 was for parts,
or if you were looking for a $900 rebuilt engine.

For about $900, if you are staying stock, you can get a rebuilt engine from
one of three pretty decent outfits in Southern Calif.  Strictly Foreign,
Quality German Engines and SIR (although heve been some discussions recently
on the list regarding one experience with SIR.  SIR is a 'factory-type'
operation in Costa Mesa that has been in business a long, long time; Quality
German has done a lot of engines over the last 20 years and has a lot of
repeat business; Strictly Foreign does them one engine at a time with one of
two guys doing most of the work.

You didn't say where you were located, but all of those folks ship.

Hope this helps.

Phil

I have a '74 Transporter with 145K original miles on the engine.  I've
practically replaced everything on the engine (carb, fuel pump, etc. etc.),
and I'm thinking of having the engine rebuilt.  Is this ever a bad idea?
Will the engine ever be as good as its early years?  Is $900 a decent price
to rebuild, including new pistons, rings, cylinders, etc.?  Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Dustin
