Subject: [T2] tick tick tick while driving

I've been driving the CA highways for a week now and besides the bumps and
gas consumption I'm not used to the bus is starting to make a few new noises
which I assume are temperature related because it's only a little colder
here than Austin. ;-)  One I think is in the rubber boot for the clutch
pedal going thru the floor.

Anway, I've noticed a tick tick tick noise while driving and I know it's not
from a rock in the tire and my wheel bearings were replaced by me recently
and there is no play there so while driving to work to today it occurred to
me that it's probably the speedo cable since the noise is in time with
driving speed.

What's the best way to lubricate this cable?  Remove it and grease it or
pour something down?
