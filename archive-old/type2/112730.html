Subject: Re: [T2] worn hydraulic lifters

Hey Karl,
Thanks for all the info.  You were right on.  I took a dial indicator to
the cam and it's not getting the same left as the other cam lobes.  I
guess now it's time to look for a new cam and lifters.. yay!

MIke


&gt; Sorry, the cam lobe will be shot. Look at a good one thru the lifter hole as you slowly turn the engine. Look
&gt; at the sharp point on the toe of the lobe. Now look at the lobe that wiped out that lifter. The point will be
&gt; gone.
&gt; The lifter you pictured is wasted. The wear pattern has gone past the hardness. Lifters are not flat. They are
&gt; ground convex. If you stand a good one on a piece of glass, only the center will touch. This is what allows
&gt; the lifter to rotate.
