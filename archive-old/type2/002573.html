The variation in camshaft gears is in Diameter, and the play,
or backlash, the meshing of teeth . These variations compensate
for differences between the centerlines of camshafts and crankshafts
as they mount in their bearings. the numeric variation in pitch radius
is expressed  in 1/100mm.

&gt;This number identifies the thickness of the each individual gear on the
&gt;camshaft gear.  Because these gears, as well as the corresponding gear on
&gt;the crankshaft, are all machined within tolerances, they will not all fit
&gt;together exactly the same.  To make up for this, the camshaft gear is made
&gt;in different sizes.  The &quot;0&quot; is the standard size.  The negative numbers are
&gt;slightly thinner gears as the numbers go more negative.  Conversely, the
&gt;positive numbers are slightly thicker gears as the numbers go more positive.
&gt;The goal is to select the correct cam to correspond to the crankshaft gear.
&gt;Unfortunately, this is difficult to do without having several cams of
&gt;different sizes available to test.  If the gears are too loose, they will
&gt;make noise.  If too tight, it will cause undue stress internally.  We
&gt;generally use +1 camshaft.  They have always provided a nice snug fit that
&gt;is not too tight.
