Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuild just one cylinder? Cam? Bigger valves?

*&gt; Now I am thinking of going to big valve (42 X 36) heads with the stock
*&gt; cam.  Is this a better idea for a few more HP?
*&gt;
*&gt; Hard to say.  It would likely reduce low-end torque and *might* make up
*&gt; for it on the top end with more hp.  However, the engineers that
*&gt; originally designed the engine understood these relationships fairly
*&gt; well and I doubt they left much on the table without some tradeoff, such
*&gt; as reliability.


could someone expand on the idea that the 42x36 heads w/ a stock cam
would likely reduce low-end torque and &quot;might&quot; make up to it on the
top end.


thanks

jeremiah
