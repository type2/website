Subject: RE: [T2] Front Wheel Bearing noise

Hey John,

I've got a '72 westy, and I just replaced the Front Wheel Bearing on the
right side.  Before I replaced it the noise was intermittent...then got
progressively worse...After changing out the bearings I took it for a spin
and everything seemed find...a little farther down the road though I heard
the noise again, more often when turning than going straight.  After pulling
off the hub again I inspected everything and it all looked fine.  How ever
the Nut had backed off a bit.  Jack up the car and tighten that down, then
barley back it off,  the book I have (I think ) said .03 -.05mm  Which is
pretty small...keep in mind that the washer technically might be able to
move, but with the grease, the guid slot on the spindle, and the pressure
from the tire it self it shouldn't be flopping around.  Then, and this is
the important part (and the reason the sound came back on mine I think)
Tighten down that Hex Bolt on the Nut Tight!  If you have a torque wrench
use it (can't remember the exact lbs needed)...but if not...you'll have to
wing it...but if it's not tight enough you'll reverse the nut off when you
back up the bus. and it will loosen on you...

&gt;List-
&gt;Haven't posted in a long time but I try to keep an eye on what is going on.
&gt;I have what I think is wheel bearing noise in the front end of my 72 Westy.
&gt;I hear it when I turn   but not when going straight. I took one hub apart
&gt;and all is well. However I can't figure out how to set the play that is
&gt;supposed to be there. Haynes says .03 -.12 mm at the spindle.  It also
&gt;says: &quot;This seems like a lot and can result in some quite noticible rock at
&gt;the outer rim of the wheel&quot;
&gt;How much rock? Does anyone have a procedure for getting this right? If
&gt;there is that much play maybe the bearing noise while turning is normal.
