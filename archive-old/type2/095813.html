Subject: re: Seats

I'm hearing a lot of different seats mentioned as possible substitutes for
original. I have a '70 westy - I need new ones but don't want to spend a lot
of time modifying, cutting, shaping, anything the seats to fit. Are there
any recommended easy fits other than the stock ones? Is there some sort of
&quot;standard&quot; rail size that works for my bus?

Andrew
