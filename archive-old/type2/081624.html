Subject: Re: [T2] Still wondering if there is a shifter plate?

Yes there is a plate under the shifter cover and it's important  to adjust
it properly for good shifting. Don't know about the beetle plate, but you
can order a bus plate from any of the vendors fo a few bucks.

Subject: [T2] Still wondering if there is a shifter plate?


&gt; Hi Everyone,
&gt; I still need advice on if the type 2 shifter is supposed to have that
plate sandwiched between the shifter base and the floor like a beetle does.
If so, can one from a beetle be used?
&gt; Any help would be appreciated.
