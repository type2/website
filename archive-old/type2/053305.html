Subject: studs

Gentlepersons-
                      Does anyone have the exact dimensions of the exhaust 
studs on a
pancake engine. I might have a source for stainless. Also, any metallurgists, 
with
pros/cons to this? I've heard that stainless &quot;work-hardens&quot;; would this be 
peculiar
to a specific grade or just in general?
Thanks in advance.
