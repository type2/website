Subject: Fuel pump

&gt;The fuel pump relay clicks when the key is switched to ON. I checked
&gt;the fuel pump voltage when cranking and it was 10.5V. Presumably
&gt;(correct me if I'm wrong) the lower voltage is due to the starter
&gt;motor.

Did you check the voltage at the fuel pump itself? Make sure wire is continuous from relay to pump. What is the voltage?

&gt;I connected a long tube to the outlet of the fuel pump and had my &gt;wife turn the key this morning. No fuel from the pump. So the fuel &gt;pump is probably bad.

Verify voltage per above.

&gt;It is normal for the fuel pump (which looks like the original 20year
&gt;old unit) to die a sudden death like this?

Dunno.

Billy
