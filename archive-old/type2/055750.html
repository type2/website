&gt;has anyone else thought of this? anyone else done this? any ideas or
&gt;thoughts - pro or con on my idea?

I built a center console in between the front seats.  It's nice when
driving but when camped I like to keep the sliding door closed and use the
front doors for entry/exit, and the center console makes it a bit more
difficult.  Not unbearably difficult, just slightly annoying.  If I had it
to do over again, I would have made the console a bit shorter (from front
to rear) to make it easier to step over.

If you're considering extending the seat across in the back, I'd recommend
making the backrest part removeable so that you can still crawl through to
the front when you're parked.  Shouldn't be that hard to do.
