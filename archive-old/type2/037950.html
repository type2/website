List,
I made a few idiot mistakes i wanted to pass on...

When you install the oil cooler on a type4 engine - make sure the thick
aluminum washers are not between the case and the cooler or she'll pump all of
her oil out - they go on the outside of the oil cooler - under the smaller
washers.

Also, if you have to drill the heads for new exhaust studs, make sure you
drill straight or the crooked studs will not allow the manifolds to mate the
heads and your exhaust will leak - you'll have to drill the manifolds out.

If you didn't mark it, the points/condenser wire goes on the &quot;-&quot; side of the
coil!

The 'oldies' are probably familiar with these and the myriad other pitfalls of
a rebuild, but some of the newbies might not be.

Pulling the fanshroud, drilling manifolds and replacing the points/condenser,
clark
