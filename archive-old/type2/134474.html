Subject: Re: carb lessons

Yeah, I've got too many buses to keep track of anyway. This one is actually 
a 62, but I have been afraid of what you said about them choking on the 
ICT's. I thought brown exhaust pipes were good until I checked the lit and 
found brown is good at the plug, but brown in the pipe means lean. Hopefully 
I'll get this engine dialed in before I damage it! This has been my first 
engine build, and I've put the poor thing through a lot in the learning 
curve.

This motor was supposed to get a 110 cam, but my friend switched me at the 
last minute to a 100. I was disappointed at the time, but after reading your 
post I'm glad to hear it worked out for the best.

&gt; I can't remember what bus or engine you have but you are right, aggressive
 cams are for drag racers and high revvers only.  I had an Engle 110 in my
 bus and it came on too high in revs.  now I have a 100 and like it much
 better.  I run the carbs with 30 mm main venturis and it runs very nice and
 fuel efficient (close to ~20 mpg highway).  Big carbs--but not too big. if
 you have larger than a 1600 it is choking on 34 ICT's.
