Subject: master cyl leaking?

Barry, Karl, et al,

So the sum total, in relation to my lack of brakes, is that my master cylinder is leaking and needs replacement correct?

I have a failed seal, the weep hole is doing its job to protect the vacuum assist, and I need a new master cylinder.

I know there is a specific o-ring I need when replacing a master, but I've never done this and would like to know any other parts/procedures I should require.

Thanks for figuring this one out for me,

Billy
