&gt; Why does it seem ( not only with the Type 2's as well as in Vanagonland
&gt; ) that possibly the most money sucking vehicles are owned and operated
&gt; by the least monetary affluent?

   I believe Peter Egan (contributing editor/columnist for Road &amp; Track)
said it years ago when he described himself as someone &quot;trying to 
maintain a sportscar on a bicycle budget&quot; ...
   For &quot;sportscar&quot; fill in your particular vehicle/hobby/passion/etc... :-)




Tony in NJ (&quot;A four cylinder British sportscar running on three cylinders
                  has a distinctive sound...Like a Spad going down over Flan-
                  ders...&quot; also Egan...;-)
