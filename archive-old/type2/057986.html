Subject: Back digests at ftp://ftp.ari_dot_net/users/dworkin/

Back a bit, I started collecting the digest posts and keeping them (mostly
to check that the mail was getting out on both versions of the list). 
During the crash and after, as various servers were cut off, some people
missed some posts.  If you are among them and want to recover any missing
digests, I have put a complete set (except for Vol 506 {anyone? :-} ) for
the last month at: 

ftp://ftp.ari_dot_net/users/dworkin/

I am considering keeping this going, just in case.  It isn't searchable or
even very readable, but may be useful if you go away and and want to catch
up on your digests.

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
