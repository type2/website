Subject: RE: [T2] Vanagon seats

&gt;  I've heard on this list of front Vanagon seats in a bus,
&gt; but has anyone put rear seats in a bus?
&gt;  I'm thinking that it might be easier to put a later, folding seat
&gt; into the back of my 70' Kombi, then to spend the time and=20
&gt; money restoring the very ratty westy bed that I have.

The back seat won't fit, about a foot too long for my '79, IIRC,=20
(came from an 83) plus the mounts are different.
