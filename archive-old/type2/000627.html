    Hi &amp; welcome back, Yet again!
Thanks to all the folks at the &quot;Type2&quot;
    Now on to the problem at hand, I have a 77 Transporter (Automatic).
Every time I make a Left turn, I can see a trail of gas left behind as I
mosey on along.
Comming from my assumption the fuel filler neck. (I put on a new gas cap to
no avail)
    My problem is this, How do I get to the fuel filler neck without pulling
the engine or cutting into the firewall?????
Thanks to all &amp; Keep on Bussin!!!!!!!!
