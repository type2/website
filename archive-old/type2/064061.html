people,

is it just me or are folks acting rather immature here? a joke was made,
perhaps in bad taste but a joke nevertheless....private email is wonderful
for such bickering. i've never seen this stuff on the list and would love
not to see it again. let's get back to the reason why we are all here: air
cooled vw vans.

just my .02 cents.
