Dear fellow bus lovers,

As a young boy I grew up in a major city with a father who bicycled to 
work every day. I was fourteen before we owned a car. I never saw my 
father ever attempt to repair any car. I had no friends who 'messed 
around' with cars. In short, I grew up as a clean fingered, art loving 
woos.

So here I am, aged 40, with a 79 Westphalia that I love dearly and a 
slight (very slight) desire to get my nails a bit banged up. I'll be 
honest though, I'm afraid of making any repair I attempt worse. Here's my 
questions for the list.

1) Should I even bother? I can afford most of the repairs needed. Will I 
get that much pleasure from my own graft?

2) If I am to enter this dark greasy world, what basic tools do I need?

3) What would be the first job I should attempt? I think my front wheel 
bearings might be going out... When I corner at speeds over 20mph, I hear 
a lower, sort of growly noise.

I'm pretty good with electrical stuff so suggestions more in the 
mechanical realm are probably more appropriate.

What have I let myself in for :)
