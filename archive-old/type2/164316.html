Subject: RE: [T2] Spare doesn't fit anymore

&gt; I recently replaced the tires on my '79 with Continental 
&gt; Vanco 8's.  They are 185 R14C's.  I had them mounted on 
&gt; Vanagon Alloys and now the spare no longer fits in the 
&gt; kitchen tire cabinet.  The spare fit fine when I had 185's on 
&gt; the stock steel wheels.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone had this happen?  Mahybe it fits, and I don't want 
&gt; to force it?


The Vanagon alloys are a bit wider than the stock wheels (6.0 versus 5.5, as
I recall).
