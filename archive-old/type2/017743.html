Subject: possibly stupid questions from on the road in spain
Message-ID: &lt;371C9CD8.C77B2745_at_ibm_dot_net&gt;

ola!

i'm presently touring around southern spain and need some know-how in a language
that i can understand.

i'd be embarrassed about these normally, but i'm email-only and not able to
search the archive, so basically i'm too far out of the loop to have shame at
this point...

please respond via p-mail.

muffler:
can mufflers &quot;die&quot; without any external sign, ie. holes, rust, loose fittings,
etc.? the bus has been getting progressively noisier over the past few weeks; to
my ears it sounds like a bad muffler, but i can't see anything wrong with it. if
this is a ridiculous concept, then what should i be looking at? there's been no
power loss as far i can tell, compression is good all around, nothing's leaking,
everything's nominal.

related question: does anyone know of a good/cheap mail-order place on this
continent (germany?) for quality (ernst? dansk?) mufflers?

doors:
my doors are rusted to hell and i found a great rust-free help-yourselfer
sitting in out in the country, so i'm going to swap them out. here's the thing:
my bus is a '78 and the other is older (73?). i've heard that you have to buy a
door conversion kit. true/false? has anyone had any problems with this
operation? do i need the kit if i have the access to all the old parts, hinges,
door check-strap, etc. and not just the bare door?

plugs: (yes, a spark plug question)
what are the absolutely-positively-100% correct plugs for a 2L 1978 fuel
injection (engine code GE)? before you answer to quickly, let me tell you that
i've received various answers from various &quot;experts&quot;. every enthusiast store in
england that i asked said W7CC, a VW dealer in france said this was correct,
then a VW dealer in valencia told me W8AC (which i don't trust). W8CC's were
installed when i bought it, and i had assumed that this was correct but i can't
find this type anywhere. thus, the whole issue has become a ridiculously inane
puzzle.

jump starts:
muir rants up and down against jump-starting the fuel-injection models. how
seriously should i take this? people tell me that this is completely unfounded.

any and all of anything remotely ressembling valid information would be greatly
appreciated. thanks in advance.
