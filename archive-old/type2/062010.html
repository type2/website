&gt; An image I'll never forget: I wish I could do that in the bus.

&lt;grin&gt; It works for tailgaters, too. A friend of mine rigged up a small 
squirt bottle under the dash, with a tube throught the air cleaner, so 
he could shoot Marvel Mystery Oil into his carb. I don't know if you've 
ever used it, but it was supposed to loosen carbon deposits in 
combustion chambers (squirted at moderate RPM directly into the carb), 
and it lays down a thick white smoke screen, with no long term effects.

I'm not sure how it would work for a bus, but it worked remarkably well 
in the PU. &lt;grin&gt;
