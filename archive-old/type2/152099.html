&gt; This time a year ago, we were trying to find a bus to buy and

&gt; 5k and nothing seems to be moving.

I think it may be a momentary blip on the nation in general, what with
high fuel prices, the Hurricane, being bogged down in Iraq and the time of
year (buses seem to sell better in late spring)

in other words for you, bad timing
