Subject: Coolness in a cooler...

Picked up a Coleman 36-qt. cooler yesterday, after noticing last week that
it measured out to exactly the dimensions between the front seats in our `77
bay.

It fits like it was made specifically for this application!  It slides
between the seat pedestals in a snug fit that doesn't mar the
removal/placement of the lid.  No hinges, so the lid can be opened from any
angle.  No drain, so no leaks, but a drain could be added from an old cooler
if necessary (the cooler has an indentation on the inside to indicate where
the drain is supposed to be if installed).

The lid has 4 cup holders (one of the reasons that we originally looked at
this one) that are deep enough to hold cup or bottle without a braking stop
tipping the cups onto the floor (maybe 2.5 inches deep).  Comes in red and
blue w/white lid.

The only concern for us was whether it would clear the seatbelts.  We have
the stock seatbelts, and the aisle end of the belt just clears the lid with
enough clearance to allow easy buckling.

We have the cooler placed so that the rear edge of the cooler is even with
the rear edge of the seat pedestals.  This seems to leave enough space at
the leading edge for me to shift without getting caught on a soda bottle in
the driver's side front cup holder, as well as enough room for someone to go
from the driver's side of the bus to the passenger side without getting hung
up on the cooler.

It's Coleman Model #6281-703 &quot;Red&quot; (UPC #076501339994), originally released
by Coleman in 1999 and currently available at Kroger grocery stores in the
Southeast for $14.99.  I'm not sure what the difference would be for the
blue version, maybe the &quot;-703&quot;?

I'm happy with it. :O)

Now to get another one for a back up...
