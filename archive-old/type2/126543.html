Subject: Re: [T2] Just put on a high quality Empi muffler (hahaha)

Hence the &quot;hahaha&quot; in the subject. ;-) 

If I had paid $250 I could have had a nice OEM muffler. But at the
moment, this bus needs much more than a muffler, so one that lasts a
year or two here in SoCal is fine by me. Long enough to get me through
the other major issues.

I really didn't expect much from a $99 muffler. I'm certainly not
going to bash Bus Depot for selling it. I knew going in it was junk.

Here's the listing on the BD site:
Exhaust System
GT 4 Tip, '72-74 all, and '79-83 non-Calif. (does not accept CAT or EGR)
Availability: Usually ships in 1-3 working days (sooner if ordered via
air shipment)
Qty 	Price 	Core 	Part Number
	$99.95 	$0.00 	VW7801321

Though I'm curious to see where the other two tips went. ;-)

I'd like a warning on the site that buyers need to be aware of the
smoke and noxious smell that comes off the first few miles of using
it. I would have been really ticked if I had started it up in a
garage. I'm sure my wife would have been throwing stuff at me. LoL!
But it was outside, nowhere near anybody's door or window. So I could
just fire it up, wait for most of the smoke to clear, and then drive
it a bit.

It'll probably smell for a couple weeks though. :(
