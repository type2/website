Subject: Re: [T2] hot air tube under the bus]

&gt; That said, I haven't done this in my bus yet. If/when I eventually 
&gt; get around to it I will probably put the vent in the spare tire well, 
&gt; and simply run vinyl dryer ducting over to the squirrel-cage fan.

   I mounted a Blazer three speed fan in the spare tire well of a 71
and capped off the engine fan at the doghouse. I used flexible
(some sort of composite aluminum/fabric) hose to recycle the
cabin air thru' the HE's...After ten minutes or so the Bus got
heat...After driving for a bit, eventually the heater ducts were
putting out HOT air...;-) The only drawback was the thing was
noisy as hell...But that's what radios are for...
