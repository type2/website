Subject: Re: Kristen Laurite memorial
X-Sun-Charset: US-ASCII

	This story makes me so sad. Besides flowers, which sometimes help
and sometimes don't, it seems to me that two dogs and a VW van need
taking care of. Kristen Laurite's dad went down the Arkansas already,
the poor man. I expect the police are very interested in
the van but will eventually be done with it. I'm afraid the dogs
won't be allowed to do a line-up if there ever is one. 

	I'd be very interested in sending a kind word and offering material 
assistance to Mr Laurite. We don't grow up expecting parents to bury 
their children anymore, in the developed world, though its only been 
a  few generations since it was common. It seems monsterous. Kristen
is beyond the pains of this world, and its needs, but her parents and 
step-father have a very hard road ahead of them. They could use help.

	Do you suppose I should call the detective investigating? 
	I'll think about this while I work. Perhaps after the next bug
gets fixed.
