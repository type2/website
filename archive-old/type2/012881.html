Subject: 1978 Wesfalia For Parts or Restoration (Arnold, Md)
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Aquired a 78 PopTop Westfalia that was T-Boned from a
local shop.  It has been on the road for a couple
years w/the big dent in the side but owners finally
ran out of bread. Needs clutch work but does run.  I
will pass on for what I paid ($625 w/tow), was hoping
my buddy Brad would want to restore but he looked at
it and didn't think so. If someone wants this beast to
restore I will sell at cost otherwise I will part out.
 It has :
full non deluxe interior, poptop which is decent, FI
2000CC engine. Clear title. Worth alot more if I part
but could be a decent bus if someone can replace the
whole drivers side.  Bus turn over very well and still
has the original key and locks.  If someone wants to
buy with the purpose of parting out I will sell for
$550 but would like to keep the curtains, back door
and some other small stuff for the 71 I am working on.

Take care,

Patrick
