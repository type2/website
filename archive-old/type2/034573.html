Subject: Shipping a bus to Italy

Folks,

I am just finishing up my 68 Westy Resoration. New engine, interior and
paint. However, I may be leaving for Italy for at least 15 months sometime
this year. Does anyone know of reputable overseas shipping companies that
might be entrusted to ship my pride and joy overseas for me. Also, anyone
with experience doing this. I will be bring the beast back home upon my
return, and do not wish to purchase a car whilst I am in Italy.

Your experience for my benefit.

Thanks,

Matt
