Subject: I'm thinkin' again.

Ya Know, , , , , , , , , ,

I've been thinkin', , , , , , , (bad sign)
This bus may just be more of a project than I'm able or willing to take on.
It's not that I don't have the knowledge or experience, it's just that I just
physically don't have the ability or stamina. And it's really not in bad shape.

I'm now thinking of selling it.
I will put in a new engine seal, but I'm afraid that's gonna be about it.

See this puppy at:

I'll probably ask about  $1600 or so for it.
Let's wait and see.
Any comments or advise?
