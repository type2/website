Rob,
  If you remove your dash you will see that it is actually 3 separate parts,
(1) the painted metal portion at the top, (2) a center portion that is about
3 inches wide and (3) the bottom portion with the instrument panel, glove 
compartment, etc..  These parts can be separated by removing the appropriate
screws.  Which portion of your dash is badly damaged?  I believe I have 
sections 1 &amp; 3 that you can have for the shipping charge, but will have to
check to be sure, and to determine what shape they are in.  I know that 
the section 3 that I have does not have the glove compartment door, nor does
it have the instrument panel, however you can probably salvage some parts 
&gt;from your broken dash.  I have never found a source for new dashes for buses.
I did find a place that will make a dash for any vehicle, but you can imagine
the expense for a one-time, custom made dash.  You may want to try scavaging
thru junk yards (if there is a VW junk yard in your area) to find a dash.
                                                Janyce &amp; Bill
                                                                            
    &gt;Westy(Lucille) was broken into in my own drive way.  The theif(ves)
&gt;proceed to tear out my stereo and take it.  Now the stereo is not why
&gt;I'm upset, I'm upset because the theif used a pry bar to remove the tape
&gt;deck and in the process took chunks out of my dash board.  Does anyone
&gt;know how I could go about repairing this (i.e. do I need to replace the
&gt;dash? where can I get a new dash?) Any help would be greatly appreciated
&gt;by both Lucille and me.  Thanks.
&gt;
