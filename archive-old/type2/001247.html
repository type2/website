Hey Everybody,

Since I'll be commuting to school this fall, over an hour each way, at
Interstate speeds, I've decided to sell my 71 bus. I've enjoyed it over six
years, having bought it from a VW mechanic who owned it 17 years. The
Weekender is basically a hardtop Westy. Here are the details:

Complete body restoration with new lower rear quarter panels; new door and
window seals; no rust on vehicle; underneath was previously undercoated
New fire engine red paint with white bumpers and rims; white tire cover
New clutch
New battery and heater boxes
30K miles on rebuilt engine
Oil temperature gauge
 Roof rack
Tires less than 2 years old
Reupholstered front seats
Westy interior: foldout bed, sink, ice box, and side table
New khaki curtains
Children's cot, wraparound front curtain, mesh screen for rear cargo lid
4 speaker cassette stereo system
Original working clock
Many other items...

If you have any interest in this bus or any questions, feel free to write or
call. Thanks.

$4300 or BO
