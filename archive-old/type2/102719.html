Subject: Re: [T2] 68 rear drum - what will interchange

This is very possible. A lot of changes were happening in the first few
months of 68 production. I wouldnt be surprised if seversl month only
brake parts are among them.
I feel like a lot of parts were holdovers from 67 that were in the process
of changing. So if a 615 doesnt fit maybe compare the drum to a 67 drum.


&gt; Bus Depot says: 211 501 615G fits 68-70 bus.
&gt;
&gt; When I looked in my old 68+ parts book, there is a handwritten note that says 'use 211 609 439D / 440D only'
&gt; to chassis no. 210 2300 000. The original number is the same as above. I have not found any clue as to what
&gt; the handwritten in part numbers refer to....
&gt;
&gt; BFY says the G fits 68-70 only.
&gt;
&gt; Bus Boys says the G fits 68-70 but they throw in an exception:
&gt; &quot;211-501-615G Rear Drum, Bus/Pickup Late 68-70 (Fr VIN 2x8 104 707)&quot;
&gt; But they do not say what fits 2x8 000 001 to 2x8 104 706??
&gt;
&gt; Chirco says the G fits 68-70.
