Barry:
Those of us unlucky enough to have Vanagons instead of bays have this weight
distribution problem even worse. My ballast of choice is water softener salt. It
comes in REALLY tough 80 lb bags and is pretty easy to clean up if spilled. I
get the cubed kind. I usually use 4 bags right above the engine. (320 lbs.).
This way I don't have to store my ballast all the rest of the year, just pour it
into the water softener. (Not that I am extremely tidy- in fact just the
opposite- just that here might be no place left to walk!)
One could just as well fill sand bags if you can find the nice heavy bags.
The problem with snow, of course, is that it's not very heavy.
