Subject: Type IV cooling flaps - observation
Message-ID: &lt;D3C18AEA0EA1D111B8DA00805F85E889011F8DC3_at_DSNTEXSRV3&gt;

I recently pulled the 2.0 type IV motor out of my 914 to fix some oil leaks
and just some general cleanup and repair.  The motor had been running hot
for the past 2 years so 1 of the things I was looking for was anything that
might account for the higher temps.  Well, I found it!

I started studying how the cooling flaps worked and was comparing them to
another set I have for my new motor.  What I found was shocking!  The rod
that connects the 2 flaps was bent/twisted in such a way that when the flap
on the oil cooler side was completely opened (ie. resting on the bracket on
top of the cooler), the flap on the opposite side was less than 1/2 opened.
The rod still looked more-or-less straight, but upon comparison to a truly
good one, it was apparent how screwed it was.

I replaced the flaps with my spare and now that the engine is back in and
running strong again, I can say with 100% certainty that the temps are a LOT
lower than before.  My gauge isn't marked with numbers, but before the swap
the needle would point to 3/4 on the scale.  Now it doesn't go over 1/3 (if
that's confusing, look at your gas gauge and use your imagination).

The only other thing I changed that might have affected cooling is to clean
the mild oily buildup from the fan, housing, and tin.  I know that will
account for a little of it, but not the night/day difference I achieved.

I'm pretty sure I ruined the rod myself.  Here's a few ways that I think I
did it (accumulated destruction):  Use the rod as a handy handle to balance
the engine during removal and installation.  Use the rod to move the housing
around after removal.  Use the rod as a leverage surface for whatever.  Trip
on the rod while the housing is lying on the floor in front of the bench
grinder.  Lean on the rod while leaning into the engine compartment to do
tune-ups (applies more to the 914 than a bus).  Etc.

So, next time you're putting a type IV together, study how your flaps open
and close before putting your cylinder tin on.  That's your only time to
make sure they're opening and closing completely.  On BOTH sides.  And be
gentle with that rod because it's not very strong.
