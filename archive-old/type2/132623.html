Subject: Ways to improve gas mileage?

Hi fellow bus owners,



I have been searching the Archives for way's to improve the gas mileage
and the only thing I have come across is to install a new ignition
system such as a Petronix. Does that work? I am currently getting about
17mpg which I have gleaned from the archives is not terrible but I want
more. Does the grand list have any ideas about ways to improve fuel
economy?

Thank you,



Max
