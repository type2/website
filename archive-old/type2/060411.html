&gt; Now, on to my Michelin testimonial:  I bought a set of inexpensive
&gt; Michelin's at SAMS about 3 1/2 years ago.  They're passenger tires and
&gt; only rated at 1300 lbs each.  Only 1 week after I put them on my 73
&gt; Westy, I had a nasty situation arise where I swerved hard left to avoid
&gt; broadsiding an idiot, then immediately put the bus up on 2 wheels to
&gt; avoid the oncoming traffic whose lane I found myself in, then managed to
&gt; put the bus up on the other 2 wheels before getting straigtened out.  I
&gt; feel certain that if I had lesser tires on the bus that I would have
&gt; torn them off the rims and/or flipped the bus.  Saved my ass.  Saved my
&gt; bus' ass (even if it does sag a bit).

Similar to the day I ran over the damn construction barrels....(hmm.
orange AND raistrick oughta get you close...:)

THE DAY I had ordered my 370's.  Still running on worn out noname M+S on
the rear, and nonamers on the front.  Damn cop in the ditch and his
blasted maglight, light hit my eyes, should have been making a bit of turn
to avoid barrels...Yep. 3 of 'em.

Pulled out of there fast, (~60 mpg foot still on it..) to avoid hitting
the large &quot;ROAD CLOSED&quot; sign.....Going mostly sideways down both lanes,
right at another car, with a FS van behind!  More severe turning, and I
straightened out.

All passenger tires, 33 front, 35 rear.  Surprised the hell out of me they
didnt blow, or tear off the rim.  Any tire can be good..ya know?:p
(there was some SERIOUS sidewall abrasion, though....)

Thankfully, I havent had to put eithe rset of 370's to that test, But I
feel it'd understeer a lot less...

later...david
