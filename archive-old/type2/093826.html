Subject: Re: [T2] Pop top order fiasco

David,

I've been caught out like this myself on occasion and I blame myself for not getting in line and placing the order earlier.  There are a lot of bus owners out there buying up this stuff.

When I am dilligent, I sometimes can't win either:  e.g. I received an email from California Imports telling me a part was in stock but they sold out in between the time they sent the notification and when I acutally read the email and called them back to order.

Bus Depot has been pretty good to me.  Many thanks to Ron and Cheri for answering all my questions.  I've only had one missing item incident, a hose, and it arrived promptly shortly afterwards when I mentioned it to them.  I've sent back a couple of items because the catalog wasn't quite right (IMHO there is a 76-79 accelerator pedal) but store credit was granted no questions asked.

I even received a call at home from them one time asking me if I wanted Mexican mirrors because the German ones were out of stock again.

I wish I lived that close to them.

BTW, I found a new supplier the other day.  Their catalog will be ready in 4-6 weeks I believe.

&gt;Where (besides bus depot) can I order a replacement pop top canvas for my 76
&gt;Westy?
&gt;
&gt;Let me start by saying that my first several orders from The Bus Depot went
&gt;very smoothly, however the last few went really sideways...
&gt;
&gt;I called them several weeks ago asking if they had the canvas in stock, they
&gt;told me no, but that they were expecting a large shipment soon.  I asked if
&gt;I should wait or order it right away.  The gentleman that I spoke to told me
&gt;that they had way more than enough to cover the back orders and that I could
&gt;call back in a week or so and place the order, which I did.  I placed the
&gt;order online this past weekend, and called Monday morning to confirm that
&gt;the one I ordered (a grey one) was in stock.  I was told that it was, and
&gt;that it would be sent out immediately.  I usually receive my orders from the
&gt;Bus Depot within 24 hours since I live so close, so today when I didn't get
&gt;it I called back.  I was told that they were sold out of the grey, and it
&gt;would take 2 to 3 weeks to get it to me, so I asked to switch to tan, and I
&gt;was told that they just sold out today... had I been told yesterday that
&gt;they did NOT in fact have enough grey to cover my order I would have
&gt;switched to the tan then... So now I'm told they have plenty of the bright
&gt;yellow in stock... or I can pay 3 day shipping from CA to have them drop
&gt;shipped from their supplier... which is just way too much money for me to
&gt;pay right now...
