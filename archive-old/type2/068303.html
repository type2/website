Subject: Re: Busses and horns...

to try to coerce some poor bovine off the tarmac (doesn't phase 'em).  So
you worldwide net community, here's the question:  Does your horn work, and
what is it for?
- - - - 

the horn in my 65 camper works.  12V bus with 6V horn, it is very loud and
abrasive, which makes folks sit up and pay attention.   This is useful to
alert someone to the fact that they are starting to change lanes and will hit
you!!
