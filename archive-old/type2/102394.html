Subject: T3 Engine in a bus??

Alright, I scored an engine! I traded some parts to a local guy for a running engine out of a squareback. It is a 1600 with dual carbs.  Anybody have any advice about the compatibility of putting this engine into a 72 bus, other than sheet metal? I know I'll probably have to fabricate some engine tin, but other than that, CAN IT BE DONE?? Anyone ever done this or heard of it being done??

Peace, John Baker
