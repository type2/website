Subject: Re: [T2] Stored Engine Starup Question

I would soak the cylinders with oil first - a light oil like 3 in 1. Soak 
it over night maybe.

Roll the engine over with the starter (coil unplugged, spark plugs out) 
until the oil light goes out.

This gets oil into the crank bearings and oil all over the cylinders.

Fire it up.

&gt;So I'm getting ready to install the engine into the 69 westy I've been
&gt;restoring. The engine is out of another bus that was crunched up front. As
&gt;of six years ago it ran great. So, should I do anything special before
&gt;starting it up? I was thinking about pulling the heads off and squirting
&gt;some oil around the pistons and rings and whatnot... My partner on the job
&gt;just wants to spray some WD-40 in the spark plug holes and fire it up. What
&gt;do you all suggest?
