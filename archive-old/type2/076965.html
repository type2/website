Subject: Re: [T2] New FuFu or Snake Oil

You can get the equivalent stuff from any of the basic FLAPS.

I've used another brand... (the $5 a can stuff)

BUT

it only lasts a few hundred miles before you go back to smoking.

The stuff is as thick as honey and I figure it can't do good things that 
relies on the oil to be thin enough to get into the tighter parts of the 
engine.

Just a band-aid for a real problem. More or less a waste of money too.

Chris
