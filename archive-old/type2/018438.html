Two hints.

DO NOT try to take the pitman arm off with a standard 2 or 3 arm
puller.  Borrow an official pitman arm puller from Trak Auto, or buy one
for $6 from Harbor freight.

Careful when you are taking the four bolts off from the base of the
steering column.  I 'had' a wire that connected one bolt on one side of
the coupler, to another bolt on the other side of the coupler.  Sloppy
workmanship, and lazy thoughts allowed me to 'tear' one end of the wire
while I was trying to remove one of the bolts which had the wire
attached to it.  I felt stupid and chided myself on being lazy.  No big
deal, but we only want positive feelings when we are working around our
beauties/beasts.  The sign should say - - - Quality work done here!!
