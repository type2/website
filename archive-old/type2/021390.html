I'm  bit of a &quot;newbie&quot; myself, although I was on this list for a short time a
few years ago.  I have the Haynes, the Bently and the Muir and I find that
almost every time I do something I haven' t done before, that I'll look it up
in at least two before starting.  I find also, that sometimes one book will be
easier to understand than the other, and I never know which one it will be.
Get them all, you will use them.
