&gt; I had replaced the battery cables before, but it turned out that the

&gt; possible?

Yes.

&gt; The wires themselves only showed 4.5 ohms on the short
&gt; negative cable and 8 ohms on the long positive cable.) Anyway,
&gt; replacing the clamps did the trick.

It doesn't take much corrosion to reduce the starting power greatly. Anytime
the starter is suspected all the cables should be cleaned first and measured
with an ohmeter:

&gt; I probably could have gone a while
&gt; longer on the old starter, but it was so trashed I'm glad I replaced
&gt; it now instead in a parking lot somewhere.

Good idea.
