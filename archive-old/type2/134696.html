Subject: Re: [T2] Need help with possible engine purchase

Thanks Mark. I was under the impression this motor was a pull from a 914, 
but I am not sure. As for the trans, I didn't look at any (it wasn't 
attached to the motor), but I was just told there were several porsche 4 and 
5 speed trannies to choose from, and no idea of what models they are.

You may be right about the 411 as this one has the removable oil cap Mike 
mentioned.

&gt; Hello John    The porsche FI isnt near as good as a late bay or vanagon FI 
&gt; I
 would switch it over personally .  Is this a 914 or a 912E motor and 
trans???
 The 914 would be harder to use the trans from also all the 914s I have seen
 have 3 bolt intakes and breather ports in the top of the heads. Sounds like
 someone either has a 411,412 motor in there or changed the heads,   The 
dipstick
 should also be on top beside the breather  .   Anyway it should work 
later
 and have fun  Mark Dearing
