This past week I remedied a similar problem in my '72.  I am not sure if
your gas tank is the same as mine.  I was smelling gas when I filled and
made turns, especially left turns.

I removed my carbs, air filter, all the junk between the engine and the
cargo area.  I then removed the panel between the gas tank and engine
compartment.  I found that the ventilation hose was shot. The filler hose
was old and I could not find a suitable replacement.  So I replaced the
ventilation hose and that seems to have fixed the problem.  The panel was
hard to get out.  I loosened one of the motor mounting braces and lowered
the engine just a bit.

I have had three gas leaks, two in addition to this one.  The first was the
fuel pump diaphragm had failed.  I replaced the fuel pump.  The second was
the accelerator pump diaphragm on the right hand carb.

Fuel injection will have some differences.

I have seen pictures of busses on fire and I do not want that to happen to
mine.  That will surely be then end for the bus if not me too.  I endeavor
to fix these kind of problems.

These busses are old and rubber does not last forever.

Good luck, and do not catch fire.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I went for a long drive down the coast last weekend. In a moment of
&gt; extravagance I filled the fuel tank right to the top. Paid the attendant and
&gt; was just about to get back in when I heard a splashing sound, I looked under
&gt; the van and there was petrol pouring down all over the place. I couldn't see
&gt; where it was coming from exactly but it was pouring down both sides of the
&gt; gearbox.
&gt; 
&gt; It stopped dripping after about 15 minutes or so and I very gingerly set off
&gt; again, fire extinguisher at the ready, and completed my journey uneventfully
&gt; apart from a smell of gas in the rear (with new rear shocks, new tyres and a
&gt; new anti-sway bar at the front it was a great trip, I even got stopped for
&gt; speeding!). I have smelt gas before when the tank has been about 3/4 full
&gt; but never bad enough to be troublesome.
&gt; 
&gt; Obviously I won't fill the tank to the top again, but in the meantime how
&gt; worried should I be by this? The Haynes manual doesn't give many clues and
&gt; as far as I am aware I can't know what sort of tank I have until I've
&gt; dropped the engine and removed the firewall. Might it be a breather line
&gt; which has fallen off or rotted? Is this a common problem that other listees
&gt; have experienced?
&gt; 
&gt; My van is a 1978 westfalia with a 2.0 ltr twin carb engine. Any advice would
&gt; be much appreciated.
