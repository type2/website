Subject: Re: [T2] 15&quot; wheels???

My bus has what I'm told are 15&quot; audi rims. they bolt onto the stock wheels
(barely). Looks nice, seems to work well. I have 215/75R15 tires on now; my
mechanic suggested that I should use a slightly lower profile tire to get
better acceleration. I think the PO had the big tires for dirt roads in the
desert.

  I know Mercedes wheels have been discussed as options for late models
&amp; vanagons (they are the same wheel, aren't they?) but I was wondering
if there were perhaps any cheap &amp; easily available 15&quot; wheels
available for busses. 14&quot; tires are hard to find and really expensive
