Subject: Re: Stuck Bolt, Help, CV's '80

I had a stripped out CV bolt on an '81 Vanagon.  My solution was
fairly simple.  Took off the nut that holds on the stub axle,
slid the axle back through the hole where the drive shaft goes.
It won't come out all the way :(  But, it does come out far
enough to get a gigantic pair of vise grips on the cv bolt head!
I clamped the drive shaft in a vise under the car, and torqued
on the bolt with the vise grips.  Came right off.

Good luck :)
