Subject: Re: [T2] Pump it yourself

I think it was to save the pump jockeys their jobs.  They need work too!

To add VW content here, I tried to get gas last week and the nozzle wouldn't
fit in my filler (it's an 81 vanagon), so I forced it (bad idea), then the
pump wouldn't work, so I pulled the nozzle back out and it was stuck, so I
forced it and it nearly tore my filler neck out.  I wonder if I was at a
diesel pump or something..  Lesson -&gt; don't force it!

&gt; Hello list,
&gt;     Am I nuts or is Uncle Sam, or his little brother States trying to tell
&gt; the American people they are to stupid to pump their own gas???  Pretty
soon
&gt; states like NJ and OR will have burrito attendants in resteraunts because
we
&gt; the American people can't eat a burrito without government supervision and
&gt; regulation.  To all of you who aren't allowed to pump your own gas......
&gt; MOVE&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; to a state that is far less supervicious and more supportive of its
&gt; citizens....
&gt; Hit them where it hurts.  And that is the tax you pay on your bus on your
&gt; house and of course for the gas you use to fuel it, be it super or
&gt; regular....
&gt;
&gt; Completely awed by Western Civilizations Demise,
&gt; Isaiah
&gt; 78 Champy
&gt;
&gt; P.S. Sorry I should have saved this for Friday.
