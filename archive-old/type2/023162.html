St. Muir's book. He has a long explaination on adjusting these carbs that 
has worked well for me.

His book ain't perfect but he gets most of it right. And you can always 
double check the other books.

Glad you're fixed up and now ya know for next time.

&gt;OK,
&gt;
&gt;10 days ago with the help of John, I thought we had the carb problem beat. 
&gt;9 days ago it started all over again - stalling out on deceleration and 
&gt;wavery idle usually ending in a stall. I have become the zen master of 
&gt;jumping out of the bus at stop lights to adjust the carb ( all to the the 
&gt;delight and dismay of rush hour traffic. ) I have re-tuned the bus twice 
&gt;and replaced all the ignition components. I have sprayed the new manifold 
&gt;boots and the manifold to head connections to test for vac leaks and found 
&gt;none. I also checked the throttle bushing and vac connections to the carb 
&gt;and found no leaks. I was sure that I did not botch the carb rebuild but I 
&gt;am a crappy mechanic so ...........
&gt;
&gt;This morning I arrived at work early and changed the points and condenser 
&gt;just to be sure. Nothing.
&gt;
&gt;On Monday I called Foreign accents to inquire about a new carb. Scott, the 
&gt;owner went ahead and ordered one for me and it was to arrive later this 
&gt;week. At lunch it was pouring down rain so I drove up the street to the 
&gt;self car wash and pulled in. Out came to the tools, tach dwell and timing 
&gt;light. After serious fussing I was able to obtain and idle but it was 
&gt;wandering between 800 and 1000 and would not hold steady. Gotta be a vac 
&gt;leak but where?
&gt;
&gt;I called Scott for some free advice. Instead Scott told me to come by the 
&gt;shop after work and he would have a look pro bono.
&gt;
&gt;I want to interject that I have carefully read and studied the 68 to 79 
&gt;bus Bentley as it pertains to the 34 pict 3 carb. The carb is most likely 
&gt;from a 71 to 73 beetle.
&gt;
&gt;I drove to FA without stalling was but running rich. I pulled into the bay 
&gt;and told Scott all I had done. He listened looked and searched for just 
&gt;the right screwdriver. He asked me If I had adjusted the air idle jet on 
&gt;the right side of the carb? No. Honestly, I could not find any reference 
&gt;to that anywhere in my books or rebuild kit instructions. I did not even 
&gt;look like a jet to me. I had it screwed all the way in. He backed it out 
&gt;and got a smooth idle. Then he pinged it so it would not move.
&gt;
&gt;Where did I miss this this? I followed the Bentley instructions to the T 
&gt;and no deal. Scott, who has worked on AC VW s for 25 years grabs a 
&gt;screwdriver and fixes in seconds what I have struggled with for over a 
&gt;week. Dont get me wrong I am overjoyed that Scott it running for me but 
&gt;can some one run down what the Bentley is leaving out about turning screws?
&gt;
&gt;As soon as I get my engine lid fixed I am gonna bring a 12pack over to 
&gt;Foreign accents to say thanks!
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
