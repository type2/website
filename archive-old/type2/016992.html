Hi Volks,

&gt; I agree- and one more thing: Germans, all northen Europeans, suffer the
&gt; effects of winter and salted roads and rust just like those of us list
&gt; members in the Rust Belt, USA. Consequently German repair parts and
&gt; exhaust parts in particular, last really well in less than ideal
&gt; conditions. Brazillian mufflers, for me would last as little as 6
&gt; months; German, 3 or 4 years. Not a lab-controlled test, but a LOT
&gt; longer!

I´m living in Germany, near Cologne, a part of Germany where you see
more rain than sunshine. I´ve tested all sorts of mufflers you can get
around here. The last one was a Brasilian one, it`s still under the
car but falling apart after 2 years. 
Before I only used the German ones, they are not much more expensive,
you get them for about 120,- German Marks around here, but they are
much better. The one under my second bus is 5 years old. 
You can get them from e.g.  &quot;Leistritz&quot; or &quot;Ernst&quot;. And &quot;Made in
Germany&quot; is printed on them in English because more people speak
English than German around the world...   ;-)
