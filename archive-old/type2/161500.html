Hi Chris,

IIRC the Ural *is actually made from the original BMW tooling taken  
from Germany after WW2.

It's a great air-cooled design that has stood the test of time.  
They're near bulletproof with minimal maintenance. Unfortunately the  
tooling is now 60 years old, so the quality may not be what is used  
to...


Happy trails,

&gt; Also see the Russian Ural motorcycle... They did the same thing  
&gt; right before WWII. Still building them, and you can buy them here.  
&gt; I would had I the budget for a toy like that.
