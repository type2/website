Subject: Re: [T2] Confused by Gauges

Cylinder head temp for head temps, oil temps for oil temps, and oil 
pressure to read oil pressure.

These are the most critical items. These are the functions that your 
driving style can most affect and these are the items that can change the 
most rapidly and cause the most damage.

I added a tach to the clock position b/c I wanted one.

The rest isn't important to me but there are certainly more useful gauges 
to be had like exhaust gas temp gauges which can help you tune the engine 
and the air/fuel ratio meter which will tell you if you are running rich or 
lean, and volts or amps which can tell you if your charging system is failing.

Despite the wide selection of gauges to be had, it is easy to run out of 
space to place them or making the dash look like an airplane cockpit.
