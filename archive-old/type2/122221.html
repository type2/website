&gt;
&gt;I also need a set for my '70 to change when I swap the tranny out.  Is
&gt;anyone interested in being part of a group purchase from Rockford CV?
&gt;
&gt;Back in early Nov., Barry B suggested that model 339-4 is a better fit than
&gt;the 814-21 that listed on the website:
&gt;http://www.rockfordcv_dot_com/Volkswagen_bootkits.htm
&gt;Is mail order a good way to go with them?  Looks like they are set up for
&gt;wholesale.
&gt;
&gt;Alternatively, I would not be averse to buying from any bus-special vendor
&gt;who would care to stock them.

In Georgia, there are four 'distributors' shown on the RockfordCV_dot_com 
homepage:

GEORGIA

Eagle C.V. Service Center Brunswick, GA 912-262-0934
Joint Shop  Marietta, GA 770-434-2277
C.V. Connection  Warner Robin's, GA 912-953-6922
Eagle Tire &amp; C.V. Joint Waycross, GA 912-283-6847

I got mine in Fredericksburg VA for $10 each, and they included grease.

Again, wait for that particular model [Rockford 339 - 4A for VW 
Transporter/Vanagon ('A' just means with the flange is attached).]   if the 
distributor says the boot is NIS.  There is another version that was 
initially sold to me, one that it would not need a tie on the small end 
because it was a 'tight' fit.  Man, it was so tight, I could not get it on 
the axle.

I brought it back (a single boot, with a bulb at the small end and three 
acordian folds) and traded up for the correct model (got four boots after I 
was impressed.  I took the bare axle to the distributor, and was satisfied.)

Unfortunately, the Rockford boots are so good, I find it not in my spirit to 
put them on either my '72 or my '78. (I put two on my '72, but since the '72 
is soon going to another owner, I am going to replace those two Rockfords 
with some Old Old Stock (OOS??) boots.  And I still have a german CV boot 
that I got as a package of -5- from another list member.)

You could lay a brick across the small end of the Rockford boot, and it 
would not compress [to the naked eye] at all.
