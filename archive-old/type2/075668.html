Subject: Re: [T2] Welding your VW

John Anderson sends:

&gt; Whoever mentioned the flapper discs though, those things are another
&gt; relatively recent and outstanding innovation.  Has anybody tried the Harbor
&gt; Freight ones at 3 for $9.99 as paying $6.50 each locally is getting a bit
&gt; old.

We have a Harbor Freight store in town. I got some of those HF flapwheels;
they seem to be about as good as the expensive ones--IOW, they wear out
quick but so did the expensive ones.
