Well, it does help damp vibrations in the tin, which cuts down on cracking
and lowers the noise level a bit.  This wasn't terribly important to a
engineer designing a utility vehicle with a life of 10 years, but it is a

several decades.

It does contain the cooling air a bit more, but I don't think that this
