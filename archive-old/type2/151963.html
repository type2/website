&gt; Anyone have anny suggestions on insulation to replace the stuff I pulled

&gt; maintain shape better.  I do want some insulation, but want to make dead
&gt; sure that I maintain airflow and drainage.  I've seen the bulley-hewitt
&gt; bus project, but I also saw the pictures of what happened to that bus so I
&gt; will sacrifice the soundproofing for having the bus last.

ridged foam panels, the kind that fits between studs.
