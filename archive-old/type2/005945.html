Setting points by dwell angle wasn't a common procedure in the US until the
late '50s, early '60s, even in dealer service departments.

For decades the norm was to set point gap with a feeler gauge.  Typically
used points had to be filed first, to remove the nub built up by metal
transferring from one point to the other.  Filing didn't eliminate the pit
in the opposing point, however.

Although setting point gap using a dwell meter is considered to be more
accurate and refined than using a feeler gauge, the procedure gained
commercial popularity primarily because it was faster than the alternative.

As the cost of dwell meters and engine analyzers came down the method came
to be accepted by hobbyists and shade tree mechanics.

Not so long ago it was common to take one's distributor across town to a
shop that had a Sun distributor machine and have it set and adjusted to the
correct advance curve and dwell setting.  This is still a very useful
service/procedure for a conventional distributor, but such shops are
disappearing from the automotive landscape as fewer and fewer vehicles with
&quot;normal&quot; distributors remain in service.

FWIW.....
