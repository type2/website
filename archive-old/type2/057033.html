Subject: '79 heater exchanger

Please Help!

I have a '79 type 2 with a rusted out passenger side heater exchanger or
&quot;heater box.&quot;  I have been trying to find a replacement for about two
weeks now and have had no luck.  Where can I find such a part and how
much can I expect to pay for it.  The one I found they want almost three
hundred dollars for... I can not afford that.  In the mean time the
local officers of the law are frowning on my noise levels.  Help.
