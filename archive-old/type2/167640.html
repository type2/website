&gt; &gt; I had a similar problem, now I am trying to remember what I did,  the
&gt; &gt; Catch block can be moved, if you loosen the few screws on the catch you
&gt; &gt; can tap it up or down slightly to adjust it.
&gt;
&gt; Yeah... that I know.  However, when the catch is moved to it's lowest
&gt; position, the latch is still hitting the catch and bouncing over it.
&gt; Plus, if you move the catch to low, the door will not be in its correct
&gt; final position when closed.

that was my problem' also. and in thinking about it I believe I shimmed
the bottom of the door and discovered that VW did so also I found stock VW
shims that fit perfectly. also you can adjust the sliding hinge, part one
of Bentley, fig 5-58   while it doesn't say so those 4 bolts also slide
inside the hinge.  I put a jack under the back end of the door, loosened
the bolts and jacked up the door slightly and retightened the bolts. took
about a gazillion tries but when I got it right the door suddenly worked
like a charm.

&gt; I'm just wondering if it's supposed to hit the catch before latching by
&gt; design or not.

no I don't think so

good luck
Bob
