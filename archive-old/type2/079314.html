Subject: Aux. Heater Blower - BN4-Powercat

Hi Volks,
Wanted to hear from anyone that has ordered from
Bluebird Custom Manufacturing (in the U.K.)
http://www.bluebird-type2.co_dot_uk/
I am really interested in the Aux. Heater Blower they
are selling. Anyone have experience with that unit or
an equivalent one sold in the U.S.? They are asking
L75 - not sure of what the exchange rate is or how
much it would cost to have it shipped to Colorado. I
sent out an inquiry to them.
BTW - I gave up on the idea to install my BN4 gas
heater in my '78 VW California Camper - it needs to be
gone through completely (it has been in a cardboard
box, looks like, for a long time - don't trust it
without a full tune-up) then installed before it would
do me any good. I decided upon a Coleman Power-Cat
instead. I am very happy (so are my kids!!) with the
Power-Cat and at $65 - a good bargain (Wal-Mart).
Anyone interested in a BN4? I do not know a lot about
them but it does look complete and in good shape - I
can send pictures of all the parts - It does not
appear to have the fuel pump. Email me off-line (make
an offer) if interested.
So about the heater blower… any information on this
unit or a similar one would be great. With the
Power-Cat and a little more CFMs – I we will be nice &amp;
warm – even in the mountains!
Thanks All!
