&gt; &gt; okso maybe this is a silly question but if i wanted to add a toggle
&gt; &gt; switch to my starting battery how would i do so?

&gt; Access Systems&quot; &lt;accessys_at_smart_dot_net&gt;
&gt; the good news is that it isn't hard at all.  I have one in my bus.
&gt; the bad news is that this has to be a rather substantial switch since it
&gt; is carrying ALL the power in the bus (or it needs to be a substantial
&gt; relay)

&quot;want to drink and drive?
go camping and sit behind the wheel of the bus and pretend. LOL&quot;

Hey,, if you do that around here, they Charge you with &quot;care and control&quot; ,,,
*If* they can find the ignition key.......  they are on to the trick of rolling
the car tire over the key.... and some cops will look everywhere for that key.
if *they* can find the key, then *you* can get it.. and that is the same as
having it in the ignition to the law here.
&quot;care and control&quot; ends up being the same consequeces as a DUI , DWI, Impaired..
flee police,etc.... insurance is astronomical... you have to take courses to get
your licence back ,, install breathalizer interlock on all your vehicles, the
vehicle is impounded for 45 days,, hope it isn't your bosses,, or your families
daily driver..., blah blah blah
When your drinking,, don't joke about driving........when you cross from Canada
into the USA,, don't make jokes about Osama in the trunk,,  when you are in an
airport ,, don't joke about.... ,, ok let's get back to the battery thing


You could have a really nice set up like the drag racers &lt;and RV owners&gt; use,,
they mount the battery in the trunk, and put a switch in the rear valence of the
car, if the car needs to be shut down a race official can run up and turn the
car &quot;off&quot;

 you could do the same with the switch as your battery is already in the rear of
the car... just put the switch beside the rear tail light.
I have seen a lot of open cage dune buggies use these &quot;keyed&quot; switches at the
battery,, with the key in, anyone can shut it down,, roll overs etc...
with the key out,, they 'think' it acts like an anti theft device to slow down
a thief

here is a switch that mounts right to the battery,, a little less conspicuous.
This is probably the style you want. available locally.

here is the relay style

For safety, if the engine is running,, you need to turn off the alternator power
also,, and think about keeping your radio powered all the time,, so you don't
loose your preset station programing
For isolation,, the green
