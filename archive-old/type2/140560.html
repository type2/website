Subject: Re: [T2] deck height

I recommend deck heights of &lt;.065&quot;, this maintains quench in the combustion
chamber. Semi Hemi chambers remove the deck on the head, this also reduces
or eliminates quench, increasing the incidence of detonation.

It is critically important that you match the compression of the engine with
the cam you intend to use, this is the biggest mistake. I can show you an
engine configuration where 8:1 is too high a compression, and another where
9:1 is too low.
