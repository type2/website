Sorry if you have had this before but I keep getting failure notices

Hello

I posted an E-mail last week as regards a Leisure battery on my 73 camper and 

how it works etc.  After reading the e-mail I sent it appears It looked like 
I was drunk whilst typing it so I thought I'd try again and see if anyone 
could advise me on how they work?
Also I am replacing my Engine and have decided on a VEGE unit.  I was 
intending on replacing it with the original 1600 AD engine but I am 
considering going for the 2L instead could anyone advise on what else I may 
need to do to upgrade i.e new carbs etc. and any alternatives to VEGE?

Thanks Folks!!!
