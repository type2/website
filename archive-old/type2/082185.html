&lt;&lt; Thanks for confirming that I have a worn synchro.  How 'bout the 
defroster? &gt;&gt;

Second thoughts on the defroster...Since you have a 1600, it might be easier
to connect a shop vac to the engine end of the heater tubes and blow the tubes
free of whatever is in there. We did this to a bus that had been sitting 
quite a
while and although it made quite a dusty/dirty mess at the dash end, it did 
im-
prove the air flow.
