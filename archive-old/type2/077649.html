&gt; Hi Jim
&gt;
&gt; I was wondering where this rule of thumb comes from,, what difference does it
&gt; make to the trans or axles if they are turning while being towed??
&gt;
&gt; Naturally you have to put the trans in neutral, and I know that the auto trans
&gt; in a North american car doesn't like the lack of lubrication while being
&gt; towed....
&gt;
&gt; I was under the impression that the final drive in a BuS or BuG automatic trans
&gt; is the same as the manual and it could be towed safely as well...

A bug automatic stick shift is an automated manual transmission and can be
flat-towed in neutral as the gears and bearings are splash lubricated.

The bus automatic is a true automatic and is lubed with a pressure pump
driven by the engine.  Some automatics do have drive-shaft driven pumps
and can be towed (and even used to push-start the car), but not very many!

Mercedes and Saturn are makes I have heard of that can be flat-towed with
an automatic.
