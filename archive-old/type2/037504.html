Subject: morning bus woes

hey all,
so i jump in lizzy this morning (73 1800), fire it up.
  she starts right up, i give a little rev, and keep
it at about 2000 rpm so she warms up a bit, then out
of the driveway and down the road.   up comes the
first stop sign, downshift, then stop, nuetral, and
stalls.   no big deal i think, as its early, very
damp, and the ol girl is probably tired.   fire it
right back up, and off i go, spitting and sputtering
all the way to work, barely makin 45.   as soon as i
put it in neutral, she shuts down.   will start right
back up again but wont idle.   doesnt run smooth at
all, and engine smelled of being choked off.   before
this it was runnin like a dream, all tune up parts are
fresh still, gas in tank is good.  engine not acting
like it is getting hot.   just wondering of anything i
should look at when i leave work this afternoon.  
could it be a case of the early morning dampness
factor, or fuel/carb issue.   didnt get a chance to
look at this morning so im just wondering of any
common problem to check out.
thanks all
