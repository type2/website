The better case for &quot;dynamic weight&quot; (as distinct from load on sidewalls) 
would be in braking. There, the angular momentum would be calculated on 
rotation with an axis through the CoG, and parallel to the middle seat.
If you are braking on a straight line, then you can add a vector of the 
angular moment to static weight and get dynamic weight.

But if you don't have a middle seat, you're out of luck.
