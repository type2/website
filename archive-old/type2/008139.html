&gt;SECOND: Has anyone ever transplanted A/C into their bus ??? I know this will
&gt;be a great feat, but well worth the bother. 

     Got it mostly installed before I sold it. Pretty easy, since it was 
a dealer add-on anyway. It's basically a bolt-it-in process. Never got 
around to bolting the compressor into the engine, since it cooled off. 
All said, it's a very easy process, all you really need is a  drill and 
the right sized wrench for the self tapping bolts. I found that a power 
driver of some sort was a lifesaver during that process-I was using a 
air-driven socket wrench, although an electric drill with a socket bit 
would work fine. Because of it not being a factory add on, it's a very 
modular setup to begin with. 



Peace,
