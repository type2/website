&gt;   How can I show or prove that the VW Type 2 is constructed on a truck

Show them pictures of the singlecab version?

I've found DMV folks to be rather typical bureaucrats.  You
have to go in, make nice-nice, and appeal to their pleasant side.  Some
research ahead of time into which employee is actually authorized to make
such determinations is important, because if you get the wrong person they
are likely to make a knee-jerk reaction to deny you what you want.  The
people at the counter are generally not the people you want to talk to.
Go in when they are not busy or rushed and they will likely take better
care of you than if you go in a half-hour before closing on Friday.
