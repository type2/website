Subject: Re: CB antenna on a westy roof

I had a similar problem years ago.

I'm a Ham Radio Operator, and wanted to mount an antenna on a westy.
I cut a hole about four inches in diameter, in  the fiberglass in the middle
of the top just above the drivers seats. The a mag mount goes through the
hole and mounts on the metal roof, and it will work fine, and the cable can
be routed into the cab from there.

&gt; antenna and didn't get good connection, even after scraping some paint
&gt; away, and with the fiberglass roof my magnetic antenna won't work.
&gt; What have other folks done to mount a CB antenna on a westy roof?
&gt;
&gt; thanks kindly
