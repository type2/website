Subject: Re: [T2] Torque

Qoth Barfry B.
Eng     bore        torque
1.7    90mm       81_at_3200

1.8    93mm      92.4_at_3000  (decent increase in bore size, decent
increase 
in torque)

2.0    94mm      105_at_2800    (Small increase bore; large increase
torque)

I thought torque was related to bore size (Harley Davidson = large bore
= 
large torque.  Same for farm tractors)

How come 2.0 has such a large increase in torque from a 1.8 with a small 
increase in bore??
As I said in private post, they increased the stroke also, making the 77
and later cases/cranks/rods  different??
