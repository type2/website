Subject: Battery Light On!

hey now,

hmm, coming back from seeing merle saunders last night my battery light came
on. DAMN! stopped, belt was still good, alternator turning. nothing blocking
either one. got home, read muir's a bit, tried to find voltage regulator.
should have been under rear seat on a '77 but wasn't. hmmmm...

so what could it be. started up the westy today, battery light comes on bright
then flickers at a higher rpm but stays on. goes off when key is turned off.
alternator?

was planning on going to the mountains next weekend. i understand that the
cooling is not affected by the alternator operation in a type iv. is it still
safe to drive? if the battery is drained i could push start it right?

any info would be much appreciated.
