&gt; hi all - just returned from my trip to portland. it was the first time
&gt; beyond my wee 40 mile perimeter in the doublecab. not much of a trip report
&gt; vw-wise. the usual - generator light dim, bright with headlights, very
&gt; very bright with wipers/blinkers. hadn't noticed that before i left because
&gt; i hardly drive at night and if then never far at all. all elsewise was a
&gt; blast except i had to sleep in the back cab three nights on city streets.
&gt; talk about your two pound cheese in a one pound package...odd thing that
&gt; happened during the trip was my back up lights now stay on with ignition
&gt; on. any thoughts on where to begin hunting with that one?    - steve
