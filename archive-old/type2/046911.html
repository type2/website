Subject: Re: [T2] Cleaning up a Shappire

Hiya John,

I've got quite a few Sapphires (seven right now) and I've learned one 
immutable truth...............after 30 years on the road these little guys 
need some TLC if they are going to continue to perform.  I'd suggest that 
this is a good time to pull him outta your dash and have him serviced.  The 
tech I use for cleaning and servicing my radios will typically do this job 
for between $25 and $30.  It'll come back to you with a 90 day guarantee and 
a much better voice.
If you're interested in going this route, drop me an e-mail and I'll give you 
my tech's number.

Mike
