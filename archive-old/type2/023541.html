&gt;&gt;Did anyone see last Sunday's episode of the X-Files?  In this episode, the
&gt;&gt;Lone Gunmen pick up Scully in a bay window bus.  Maybe someone should print
&gt;&gt;some bumperstickers reading:  &quot;VW Bus:  Official Vehicle of the Lone
&gt;&gt;Gunmen!&quot;

Yeah I saw that, except it was a little unrealistic when it was screeching
around the corners, I have a feeling that was edited in, otherwise that bus
would be on its side if it was going fast enough around a corner to peel.
