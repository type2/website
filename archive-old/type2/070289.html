&gt; One more thing.  I just read an article by Rich Kimball about the
&gt; 1973 Type2.  In this article the author states &quot;On the 1968 through
&gt; 1972 models, the front turn signals were located below and a liitle outside
&gt; the headlights, just above the front bumper.  For 1973, the front turn
signals
&gt; were moved higher on the front body panel ...&quot;  I have a wrap around
&gt; front bumper with the rubber-covered built-in step under the doors.
&gt; And my turn signals are mounted high on the front panel at either end
&gt; of the front air intake grill.  Is the article wrong or do I have a
&gt; diferent kinda bus or what?  The photos in the article are of a
&gt; Westfalia.
Look at your VIN to see what year the camper is. The 3rd number will be the
last digit of the year, as in a 3 would mean a '73. There should also be a
silver sticker on the inside of the driver's door frame with the manufacture
date on it...look at the taillights as well. One of the must perplexing busses
I ever saw had the 2 piece rear lights, but high turn signals, a combination
which ought to have never happened naturally. I was confused until the owner
told me the front section had been replaced...
Anyway
