&gt; When all the wiring is connected, I do measure 12V when the ignition

&gt; If I measure the resistance between  the &quot;other&quot; terminal of the
&gt; injector and ground, I don't measure zero ohms.

You measure infinity?

When it's not energized the ECU has broken the connection from that terminal
to ground.
 
&gt; Am I correct that the ECU is supposed to ground this other terminal
&gt; in response to the points being closed?

Yes.

&gt; If this is correct, can anyone suggest a reason for my ECU not giving
&gt; the proper ground to the injectors?

Just curious but what kind of readings do you get when you measure the
resistances between varies grounding locations on the engine case?
