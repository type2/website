Fellow Type 2 Listers:

Has anyone else had problems with RMMW lately.  Normally they have given me
very good service when I ordered main bearings from them over the weekend
they sent me crap! In trying to get satisfaction from them through their
customer service line, I got the following

&quot;As I discussed with you today by phone, your shipment # xxxxxxxxxxxxx
contained a thrust bearing which was gouged and scratched.  The split
bearing was oily and it was evident that it had been in someone else's
engine.  WHAT'S GOING ON? To this date your service as been exemplary.
Obviously someone took returned parts and  put them back on the shelve so
they could be shipped out again&quot;.

&quot;When I called your customer service line this morning, I was placed on
ignore for 10 minutes (each time of three) and then got a message to leave
a message on the phone mail, only to get a message there that the phone
mail system was full.  I then called your sales line and they put me on
hold again for 8 minutes and then transferred me to the customer service
line where I went through the same process again (including a full phone
mail message).&quot;

&quot;I called your sales line again and demanded to talk to a supervisor.
After ten minutes again on hold, he finally transferred me over to the
customer service supervisor. She was polite and promised to send me the
parts I had ordered again and gave me a return # (xxxxxx).&quot;

&quot;This afternoon, I repackaged the bad main bearings and sent them back to
you (insured).  As your customer service supervisor promised, you owe me
$5.00 for the postage and insurance.&quot;

&quot;IS THIS THE KIND OF SERVICE AND QUALITY I CAN EXPECT IN THE FUTURE FROM
YOUR COMPANY?  If so I'll take my business elsewhere.&quot;


If I'm going to pay this much for parts I'd like quality and service too.


Have fun
