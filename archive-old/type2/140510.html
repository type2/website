Subject: [T2] 78 Flywheel Seal Tips - Oil Leak Fixin'

There are several manufacturers of the main seals.
The front main seal needs to recess enough that the new seal doesn't ride on
the radius area of the flywheel.
It sometimes requires about 1/8&quot; recess. There are seals made that can set
just flush and clear the radius.
Just be aware of the options when you set the seal.
