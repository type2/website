Subject: Stumbling and Bucking FI 2.0

Bad stuff; Bad.  When I let off the throttle, Mule starts to buck.  If I
slip the clutch, then put her back into gear and accelerate, seems to go
away.   R&amp;R'd points, condenser, rotor, and cap.  No improvement.  Swapped
out coil.  No improvement.  This weekend I'll put in a new fuel filter, and
swap out her dizzy for good measure.

What should I be looking for?  I'm not that experienced with troubleshooting
the FI system. Could a bad decel valve cause this?  I have spares of
everything, but I'd love some guidance so this process becomes a little more
efficient.  I need Mule to get my tools to the job site on Monday.  Yes, I
have all the manuals, so give me page numbers, not reprimands.

Thanks much
