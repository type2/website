Subject: Re: [T2] bad buyer

&gt;Do all of you know how many owners your Bus had? I am the 4th. 
 
I don't.  Mine was a rescue.  Previous owner was my sister who was going to junkyard it, previous to her someone named Dawn, previous to that no clue.  I'm fairly sure I have an original engine.  Everything else is still original.
