&gt; so I've mannaged to get the engine out and the fly wheel and all to replace 
&gt; my needle bearing.  but its almost all disintedgrated.  we're trying to 
&gt; chisel it out.  there is about 1 mm left of it and its really stuck in there 
&gt; good.  any other ideas how to get it out.  i as thinking of carefully 
&gt; drilling it out but was are the ramifications if i drill too much around and 
&gt; the new needle bearing fits in loose.   also when i do finally get it out 
&gt; should i greese up the new one first before puting it in?

there are needle bearing pullers available that expand behind the bearing
and pull put with a slide hammer.  You can also make one yourself with a
washer and some creative grinding and filing.  It should tilt to go
through the bearing and then straighten out behind it.

You can also use a small chisel to cut the old bearing down one side.
then it will pull out easily.

I wouldn't go anywhere near the bearing with a drill!  A dremel mototool
might be used with a small carbide cutter to cut through the side of the
bearing.

If we're talking about a type 1 engine, then you could simply replace the
gland nut.  Not an option on type 4 though!

&gt; Does anyone know what could cause this to happen to the needle vearing.  Am 
&gt; i in need of a new tranny soon???

usually the culprit is lack of lubrication.  Be sure to lube your new
bearing with the thickest grease you can find.  I use Bosch distributor
point grease.
