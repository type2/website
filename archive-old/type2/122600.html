Subject: Re: [T2] heater cables question

on 3/10/04 07:43, Chris M. related:

&gt; Here's a question for you: I have the cable sheaths but the two short cable
&gt; wires are shot. What kind of wire is this? Is this larger diameter piano wire?
&gt; I'd like to shop for about 25 feet and replace (recreate) my short cables. I
&gt; do not think Bus Depot and friends offer these cables... Info: I know
&gt; motorcycle and bicycle cables are stranded cables and thus not the right
&gt; stuff. 

chris,

you are correct here on all counts. that cable is NLA. and the cable is
solid spring wire.
 
you can make it. i haven't tried to make that particular one, but i have
made similar bits for other vehicles before. if you are handy it can be
done. really good teflon lined bike cable sheathing (i think it is used for
shifters, not brakes) will work as the outer. The inner could be any number
of things, but stainless piano wire might be best. you could scavenge the
ends off the old cable, or make new ones that have tiny machine screws that
hold them onto the cable.
