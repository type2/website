Subject: RE: [T2] Alternator, rebuilt, high output, lifetime fact 

	Volks:

	As was pointed out by another list-member (though I won't quite go
there language-wise) in their advice to RTFM...  I too had a st*ffy for
solving battery issues by going to the 70 amp unit UNTIL I was advised that
unless I had a complete late motor to scavenge those NLA parts from, well...
Let's just say it is not a straight replacement.

	Do the research before you run off and decide that a high output
alternator is going to solve your ills - the OE voltage regulator is the
bottleneck to the system.  It's designed to charge wet (flooded) batteries,
and not the newer style batteries which demand a higher charging voltage to
keep them in tip-top condition.  My first big tip to this was found in an
article that was in the Type 2 Library, of all places ;-)  Others far more
knowledgeable than I have reviewed my research and modifications, and
validated my conclusions... (Thank you, Jon S.)

	IMHO, there is nothing worse than spending bags o' dollars on
something which turns out to NOT solve the problem.  Optimize what you got
with proper cabling and a better VR, and if that don't get it for you, THEN
start going after the spendy 70-amp solutions.  Incidentally, at a point in
the distant past, Kymco out here in Cali was tweaking the T4 standard
alternators up to a 75 amp spec, but they could not get any lifespan out of
the diodes, nor could they find any suitable replacement diodes (or so they
told me)...

Classic), contact me off list, or if listees reading this knows him, have
him get in touch with me
