&gt; &gt;&gt; what your supposed to use the clutch when changing gears while moving???

&gt; I know what Tony was saying.  He appears to be a Joisy Italian, but I think
&gt; he learned to drive in Scandinavia where clutching is taught as an option.
&gt; =)  With a full synchro trans you *can* shift w/o using the clutch, even in

withOUT any synchros you can shift w/o using the clutch too!
that's why transmissions without synchros are called &quot;crashboxes&quot;  folks
don't know how to shift and &quot;Crash&quot; into the gears

Bob

&gt; an acvw.  I guess it's meant to save the clutch.  Seems to be though, that a
&gt; clutch is easier and cheaper to replace than blown synchros.  Leave the
&gt; speed shifting to the Hondas.  It's a bus for cryin' out loud.  All I'm
&gt; doing is trying to save my valves.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for confirming that I have a worn synchro.  How 'bout the defroster?
