Subject: Gearing Math?

    I know somewhere I've seen a calculator for figuring gear/tire
ratios and speed, but can't recall where. Does anybody have one of these
or the URL for same?
     Just got my 225/75-15's on the back, sure did make a gearing change
from my previous 185/75-14's. Mostly going from 3rd to 4th, tho. Had to
downshift this morning on a long hill in a 40-50 zone that I could
always pull in 4th. 
      I also will need to refigure my speedometer when I get the new
front feet on. Anybody know the math for that?
    Couldn't put the new fronts on last night because the bolts I got
last night were too short -- the front wheel lug bolts are longer, since
they have to go thru the brake rotor -- so I have to try to find longer
ones tonight. I'm just using 14mm grade 10.9 cap screws for now, in lieu
of the real wheel lugbolts, until I can get some of those hard to find
items (hard to find in other than stock length, that is, at least here
in Mobile).
