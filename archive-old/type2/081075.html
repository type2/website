Subject: RE: junk yards in carolina

Bryan,
    I know of some places in or near Wilmington that you can check. In
Wilmington, NC there is one salvage yard and 3 air-cooled VW shops that I
know of.
    A true salvage yard
    1. The Bug Shop in Holly Ridge (329-0022) He has a wide variety of
vehicles in his yard; he's a bit
        expensive, but has lots of different vehicles. (www.thebuggshop_dot_com)

    FLARS
    1. Silver Lake VW on Market St. (791-6308) He has some parts vehicles
outside and misc parts inside
    2. Count's VW on Wrightsville Ave (I haven't been there in a long time,
&amp; I can't find their #)
    3. Sunset Automotive on Carolina Beach Rd (763-7650) I think they have a
yard out back

I hope this helps
