Subject: [T2] Wisconsin to Florida -- oh well, I tried

The short version:
Bus (1970 Westy) ran fine until I got to South Georgia, where it simply
quit. The symptoms:

1) VDO oil pressure (not temperature, pressure) gauge suddenly goes off the
end of the scale. It had been running at 45 pounds highway (60-65 mph) for
more than a thousand miles, steady and sure. Then suddenly it shoots up to
over 80 pounds, then the needle keeps on going and pegs. My mind is set to
register panic over low oil pressure, not high. &quot;Weird,&quot; says I, cruising
along and enoying the southern Georgia scenery. &quot;Must be a problem with the
gauge.&quot; So I shove in the clutch to see if varying the engine RPM will make
any difference. I manage to let it idle once, rev it up again, when the
engine backfires and dies. Will not restart for love nor money. Backfires
through the carb. Spins fine.

2) I also run a VDO oil temperature gauge which is mounted in the oil sump
and always reads low (120-180). I got into the habit of just adding 70
degrees. The oil temp gauge did not show any abnormal readings before the
disaster.

3) No red light before the engine stopped. Engine is not hot when I inspect
it. Oil level is okay.

Question: What the hell could cause such a sudden rise in oil pressure? Am I
looking at two different problems that just happened to occur at the same
time, i.e. something goes wrong with the engine and the oil pressure sender
crapped out? I don't get it.

Anyway, rescued by Charlie Ford, entrepreneur and one of the idea men behind
the AIRS list. Got a shirt to prove it. Full trip report to come.
