Subject: Re: [T2] strange offer - thoughts?

A dream is a dream. If he wants it bad then he is ready to do the thing.  
CASH only and done deal. Take your roof rack off and sell it to someone else. I  
cruise around looking for cars and if someone says a price I like I go to the  
bank and do the deal before someone else gets the jump on me. Good luck. CASH 
 for TITLE.
