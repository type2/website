&gt;* the engine isn't compressing fully in all cylinders. (80-120-120-120).

	The 3 120s are like a dreadm.  Even the one out of line 
doesn't necessarily mean anything much wrong.   To measure these 
compressions accurately, the motor has to be warm AND the throttle 
open  (therefore the ignition disabled during cranking).  Otherwise, 
true figures are not read out.
