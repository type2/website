Subject: Re: [T2] engine case and stuff

First off you might want to find out what &quot;type&quot; of engine it is. Type 1 or 
4? The most notable differences between the two would be the fan shroud, 
location of the oil cooler, and location of the alternator/generator. Also, 
there are some differences found on the underside of the engine on the oil 
sump.
Type 1- upright cooling system, some may call &quot;doghouse&quot;. The oil cooler 
stands up verticle from the block and is inside the shroud, and the Alt/Gen. 
sit atop a stand. One plate on bottom of engine that has your oil plug.
Type 4- &quot;pancake&quot; shroud cooling system. The oil cooler lies on it's side, 
and the alternator is on the right side of the engine. There will be 
multiple &quot;plugs&quot; and bolts on the underside of the oil sump, and also an 
additional fitting that accepts a standard oil filter.

I only review these major differences so as to help you if you plan to sell 
the case. That will also give you an idea as to if the bore/stroke of the 
engine is stock.

If your engine is of the type 4 pursuasion (sp?) then visit this page for 
useful references: http://www.tunacan_dot_net/t4/reference/index.html

Also, whether you have a type 1 or 4, check out my buddy Nate's page for 
VERY helpful tech tables to help you identify that engine based on the 
engine number: http://www.nateswaterart_dot_com/vw//tech_tables/

Good luck! And if it happens to be a Type 4 case, please do reply as I'm 
looking to use a Type 4 for my Ghia and may be interested.

Have a great day!
