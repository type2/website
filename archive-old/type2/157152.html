Subject: Robert Mann

Hey, guys.  I got an email from Robert Mann saying that he isn't  getting any more Type2 emails or responses to his.  Has he been  banned for some reason?  I know he's a little wacky but I rather  enjoyed his kiwi-laden posts.  
  
  But then I think it was Oscar Wilde who said, &quot;I wouldn' t want to be a member of any club that would have me as a member.&quot;
  
     Cheers...KR
