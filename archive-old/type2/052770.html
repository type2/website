&gt; Ron
&gt; A number of weeks ago you said you had Pacesetter mufflers for 82
&gt; Vanagons.
&gt; What is the current price and part #.  I just called your shop and
&gt; nobody new what this was.



It's $94.95 with listmember discount; part number 57187. Fits '72-74 bus
plus '79-83 aircooled.  You can order toll-free at 1-866-BUS-DEPOT now that
you have the part number.  (Make sure to ask for your listmember discount!)
To play it safe, ask them to specify Pacesetter Only on your invoice. It is
the brand we usually ship, but on occasion we may substitute an Empi if the
Pacesetters are out of stock.  If we know you specifically want a
Pacesetter, we'll have them dropship one to you directly even if we don't
have one on hand, rather than ship an Empi equivalent.

But once again, I recommend the stock '72-74 setup ($179.95 in stainless,
$149.95 stock) over the Pacesetter, as it is considerably heavier duty, and
in the long run well worth the extra $$. (Part numbers 071 251 053EKS and
071 251 053EK respectively.)  And finally, a reminder that none of these
accepts a CAT or an EGR filter.  (I have one that does, but it's $285.)
