Subject: Type 4 rocker assembly Q

I was cleaning my rocker parts today as part of the engine rebuild, and I
noticed that I don't have any washers on the shaft between the spring and
the intake rockers, as shown in Tom Wilson's book.  Should I try and get
hold of some of these washers, or just leave it as is?  There isn't any
noticeable wear, just a small polished area on each rocker.
