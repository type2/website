I have not used Hammerite on a Bus yet, but do have experience with it in a
hostile environment.

We have a heat register in our bathroom that's right next to the tub/shower.
It gets a bit wet every time someone showers, and of course cycles between
cool and warm as the furnace cycles.  I fought rust and peeling paint on
that register for over 25 years, and no finish lasted more than ~a year
without rusting.

Six years ago I hauled that register out to the shop yet again and cleaned
it down to bare steel with wire brushing and steel wool.  A few spots of
oxidation remained deep in grooves of the stamped louvers, but it wasn't
worth the trouble or expense to have it sand-blasted or acid dipped.

I painted it with 2 coats of bronze Hammerite [spray can], following their
instructions closely.  The register still looks as if it's freshly painted,
with no sign of rust or any other defect in the finish.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  The Hammerite product I use is sold as &quot;Rustcap&quot;.
My local Hardware store now carrys it in white/green/blue/
aluminum/gold...etc etc. Also comes in spray cans. I opt.
for the brush on as even with that you have to have good
ventilation. This stuff appears to be almost a epoxy based
paint with different materials in suspension. The white is
filled with &quot;glass flakes&quot; that they say settle and
interlock... I assume the metalic stuff is the same. At any
rate. Once applied.... its there for the duration. Water
has absolutly no effect on it. It has a gloss finish and
conforms to whatever is under it. So if you want a smooth
finish you have to insure the surface is smooth. They claim
you can paint over rust...  etc etc. If you sand it, wear a mask!  &lt;&lt;
