&lt;&lt; A friend is looking for a gas heater for his '71 Westy project. He would
 &gt; prefer the BA6, complete and working. I offered to ask y'all. Anything
 &gt; out there? &gt;&gt;

'71's a bit different, the heater is bolted to the engine tin on a small 
stand (one of the benefits of the upright) and the ducting into the passenger 
compartment is fairly easy to unbolt. Prob seems to be cutting the holes in 
the right places. The one I found for my '70 is a BN4 so I dont know how much 
different the BA6 is. Check the library for some great tech tips
