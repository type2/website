Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator Questions

From: &quot;john kolak&quot; &lt;jkolak_at_gmail_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Congratulations!

Thanks, but it's really a case of someone going through &quot;New Bus Owner 101&quot;.

&gt; The only point I see in moving the wire to the starter is because that is
where future mechanics / owners will expect it to be.

What, and deprive myself of being one of those PO's who leave havoc in their
wake? :O)

&gt; Myself, I always thought it was kind of indirect to have the current go to
the starter, and then from there go to the battery for charging. I guess
since the bus really runs off alternator current when running, it creates a
more direct route for the current to go more directly from the alternator to
the rest of the bus electricals.

I agree.  It's just a lot easier to leave it where it is.  I've got one of
those silly replacement ends on the positive cable and I just attached the
wire to one of the bolts.
