&gt; I know this thread kinda died out but I think I have a
&gt; doozy. I have a 72 Westy. A PO had installed an electric
&gt; fuel pump. During the course of a tuneup at least 4
&gt; years ago, I replaced the round silver thing I thought
&gt; was a strange fuel filter with your standard inline
&gt; filter. Today while catalog browsing i happened on the
&gt; page with the electric fuel pumps and read that they
&gt; require a pressure regulator. Said regulator is pictured
&gt; below as round silver thing. I immediately ran to the
&gt; garage and combed my meager spare parts collection to no
&gt; avail. It must have ended up in the trash.
&gt; sigh
&gt; Does this make me extremely lucky for not having gone up
&gt; in flames?
