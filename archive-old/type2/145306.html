vacation????), anyway, if there is anyone in Virginia or around that could
help (location, place to work, tools...) that would be nice... i should be
leaving MTL Friday so i can be in VA the same night...

_________________________________________________________________________
Greetings and happy holidays!

Thus far, this member's Holly days has not been happy. I left Montreal,
Quebec three days ago, bound for Tuscon, Arizona, in my 89 Syncro
camperwannabe. Seemingly out of the blue, i developed what i originally
thought to be a piston slapping noise, but shortly after, i lost my oil
pressure. With lights flashing and buzzer buzzing, i pulled over and
realized (through deductive logic) that at least one of the connecting rod
bearings were burned, hence the reason for my lost oil pressure. At this
point, i called my mechanic in Montreal, he advised me that i could drive
the car, not exceeding 2000rpm if i needed to move it. I needed to move it.
As i was driving, the engine quit altogether. I arranged to plateform my van
to a Wal-mart parking lot, from whence i am dictating this to a friend back
in Montreal so she can post it for me.

I need to locate a good to very good used 2.1L engine somewhere 'cause i
think it will break me to buy a rebuilt short block and have it build up and
installed (though i am opened to suggestions in this regard). The best would
be to find a solution somewhere on the eastern seaboard; a reputable garage
to installe a used engine or a rebuilder who can install has well (if not
too expensive).

Any input from any of you volks out there will be ever so appreciated. I'm
near Arlington, Va. PLEASE respond has soon has you can; i am living in the
van and this cannot go on for long.

You can call me on my cell: 970-901-8251

A HUGE thank you for your attention. Smooth sailing, Allone.

Cheers,
