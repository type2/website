&gt; what are the pros and cons to downshifting? i know some people who drive and
&gt; downshift to a stop every time? why? i just throw it in neutral and cost to
&gt; a stop. less wear and tear on clutch and stuff right? Hmmm? I hate stick
&gt; driving and downshifting is like doing double duty.

Believe it or not, there is in many vehicle codes, a section that prohibits this
manuver.   In the California vehicle code, there is one prohibiting it on a
downgrade.  I believe if I search long enough there is one to be found that
prohibits it at most any time.

CA Vehicle Code:
21710.  The driver of a motor vehicle when traveling on down grade
upon any highway shall not coast with the gears of such vehicle in
neutral.
