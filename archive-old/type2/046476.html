Subject: [T2] signing off, off to Germany

Signing off the list for a week as I'm leaving for Germany.  I've got a lot 
planned for this trip and it will be difficult to get it all in a week.

I will hit the auto show in Frankfurt for about a day and a half and then I'm 
hoping to head up to Salzgitter and campout with the German Bulli group.  
Then I'm off to Dusseldorf for the camping show, and somehow I'm going to 
head to Wolfsburg to see Autostadt before heading home.  I'm renting a 2000 
TDI California Westfalia camper to travel and camp in.

I'll be available by pmail or phone tomorrow, but I won't be able to ship any 
new orders out until the end of next week.
