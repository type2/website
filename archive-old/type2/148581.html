Subject: Re: [T2] Shocking Question

One other lesson learned. Don't explicitly trust the PO.

The PO had installed some gas filled shocks that were longer than the
stock shock size. So, when I took off the old shock and compared them
to the new ones I just assumed the long ones went on the front. Well,
we know what they say about making assumptions. In my haste to try out
the new front shocks I didn't even look at the rear shocks - silly me.

&gt; Well I feel like a dope. I did indeed have the shocks reversed - with
&gt; the rear shocks mounted in the front. Note that at least I didn't also
&gt; have the front shocks on the rear.
