Subject: VW Service Manuals (Bentley):  Reduced Prices

About six months ago, I began offering listmembers discount pricing on 
Bentley manuals, through my part-time parts business.  A lot of you have 
taken me up on it, and partially as a result, I've been able to negotiate a 
slightly better deal. Therefore, I'm happy to report the following price 
DECREASES:

        SPLIT WINDOW BUS FACTORY SERVICE MANUAL ('63-67):  $65.00
        BREADLOAF BUS FACTORY SERVICE MANUAL ('68-79):     $27.00
        VANAGON FACTORY SERVICE MANUAL (all Vanagons):     $62.00       
        Also, Muir's idiot guide (How to Keep VW Alive)    $20.00

Prices exclude shipping &amp; insurance, as follows:
        East of Mississippi $4.00.   West of Mississippi, $5.50. 
        Priority Mail (&quot;2-3 day&quot; delivery) $6.75 anywhere in US
        Pa. residents add 6% tax.  Canadians, e-mail me.

I'll continue to accept list members' personal checks (haven't been burned 
once!), or can COD for $4.50 extra.  Usually can ship within a day or so of 
getting your check, especially if you e-mail me and let me know it's 
coming.  Can also get other Bentley's and Haynes manuals, but, alas, not 
the fabled Eurovan manual.
