Subject: Re: Hail, My turn

Yep, found out about *real* hail myself, recently!

Granted, I live in a very small town (30,000 and that
includes dogs, cats, and goldfish), but the damage was
pretty high. The new auto dealers were offering pretty
awesome deals on new cars with hail damage....like in
the $2,000-5,000 discount area!

We even had a 'roving' auto hail-damage-repair company
come to town and set up shop for a month!!!!

I've seen quite a few vehicles around with 1/4&quot; deep
craters (no kidding), spaced about every 4-6&quot; apart. 
Windshields sound pretty cheap, by comparison.
Still....Ouch.

Many of said vehicles are *way* beyond repair because
of their age, insurance-status (hey, this is *exactly*
why I pay for full-coverage on my 31 year old bus;-),
etc. I know more than a few  people who'd *just* paid
off their auto loans, and were 'taking a break' from
paying high full-coverage premiums, and now have their
investments devalued by ten-fold. 


Thank God for my Westy's fiberglass top!!! No damage,
whatsoever....but I was definitely one of &quot;the few,
the proud, the damned lucky&quot;!!!:-) 


Saved by the bus again!
