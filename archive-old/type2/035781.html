Subject: Re: Deal on Boge shocks!

Sorry, Ron...

But...


I feel the change to a good gas-shock (like the KYB
Gas-adjust) is a *very* wise choice.

My '69 Westy had O.E.M. (I.E., dealer installed)
shocks when I bought it. They were 5 years old, but
still working properly at the time. I had some extra
cash at the time and chose to follow other listee's
advice and try the KYB Gas-adjusts.

I'm glad I did.

I realize that shocks alone *should* not account for
too much of a difference in handling; but they did.
EVERY aspect of my bus's handling has improved;
cornering, wind (ok, not much, but with a bus...every
little bit counts), nose-dive when under hard-braking
(BIGGGGG PLUS, here!).... 

It's ALL better....*much* better and it only cost me
$24.00 per shock, with a lifetime (pro-rated, of
course) warranty, to boot. WELL worth the extra $28.00
(but no shipping;-) to do the whole bus! 

Now, if these were the ol' green Bilsteins at this
price.... 8-)


Sorry, Ron....

&gt; I just got a closeout deal on Boge shocks that might
&gt; interest some list
&gt; members.
&gt; 
&gt; These are genuine Boge original-equipment shocks,
&gt; made by Boge/Mexico to
&gt; Boge/Germany specs.  (Sachs/Boge has had an
&gt; affiliate factory in Mexico for
&gt; some time, which builds much of their Sachs and Boge
&gt; branded product.)
&gt; Supposedly they're as good as the German ones and
&gt; have to meet the German
&gt; Boge specs according to the terms of their contract
&gt; with Germany. But even
&gt; if they just come close, the're a heck of a lot of
&gt; shock for the money,
&gt; since they're now priced at what you'd normally pay
&gt; for an &quot;off brand&quot;
&gt; shock.
&gt; 
&gt; Price is $16.95 each (plus shipping).  Applications
&gt; are:
&gt; 
&gt; Rear,  '65-67 bus    211 513 031H  (Boge claims this
&gt; shock is also for front
&gt; of '66-67??)
&gt; Front, '68-79 bus    211 413 031P  (Boge lists it as
&gt; '70-79, but others list
&gt; same part # as '68-79.)
&gt; Rear,  '68-79 bus    211 513 031R
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The reason for the bargain price is that they are
&gt; boxed under the a brand
&gt; name that Boge is no longer going to use, which is
&gt; Technum.  They had been
&gt; using this name in certain international markets,
&gt; and apparantly their
&gt; marketing arm has now decided to use the Boge name
&gt; in those markets as well.
&gt; So I bought out the Technum branded ones at a
&gt; closeout price. These are the
&gt; same shocks that are being shipped under the Boge
&gt; name. I got them directly
&gt; from Sachs/Boge themselves, along with a memo
&gt; confirming their pedigree.
&gt; 
&gt; These are an oil filled, not a gas-charged shock,
&gt; just like the stock ones
&gt; that Boge made for VW.  They would be just the
&gt; ticket for someone who wants
&gt; to maintain his bus's stock ride, rather than opting
&gt; for the somewhat
&gt; stiffer ride (and higher price) of a performance gas
&gt; shock like the KYB
&gt; Gas-Adjust.
&gt; 
&gt; They will hopefully be on the website Saturday
&gt; morning.  In the meantime,
&gt; you can always e-mail me to order, or give us a call
&gt; at the shop on Monday
&gt; (by which time they will definately be on the
&gt; website anyway).
&gt; 
&gt; This was a limited-quantity buy, so it will be
&gt; first-come first-served.
&gt; (Splitty shocks particularly are in short supply.)
