&gt; &lt;snip&gt;  I am planning to set up a web site with this,
&gt; &gt;and Free Parking (who likes to pay $12 a nite to sleep in a parking lot) as
&gt; &gt;their themes.
&gt;
&gt; My favorite places are motel/hotel parking lots.  They are quiet,
&gt; relatively safe, I never get hassled there, and they are everywhere.

Great idea! There's always a back corner... I will include that on my site for
interstate traveling. I was thinking more of back road traveling, I have had great
luck finding little out of the way spots, the type the locals know about for
fishing etc. that don't have no trespassing or parking signs. Sure, sometimes you
get rousted, or kept awake by locals partying, but more often than not are left
alone. Americans love their gypsies.

&gt; &gt;Has anyone tried putting solar cells on the roof? I wonder if enough amperage
&gt; &gt;can be drawn to keep systems going, as I recall the fridge draws about 8
&gt; &gt;amps.
&gt;
&gt; I have two solar panels mounted on the roof of my bus that provide about 4
&gt; amps of power in full sunlight.  I would like more but I am somewhat
&gt; limited on roof space when compared to a Westy because my highroof gets narrow -
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;

I was actually thinking of using those all weather flexible ones and just
laminating them to the roof..
