Subject: Re: value of 36hp engine?

Its probably not worth more than $100 or so for parts....unless its been 
running and recently rebuilt with new parts, there isn't much value to it. 
36 hp parts are still fairly easy to come by. What may be valuable is the 
case....36 hp cases have a problem with the bearing seats being pounded out 
of shape, and unfortunately 36 hp cases can't be line bored...

I agree a core 36hp is not a high value item, but you can line bore the
cases.  What you need to be careful of is the cranks.   I would not use a
thrice turned 36hp crank in the motor I was building if you paid me to.
  They are so small they need all the matal they have.    I prefer standard
or once turned cranks in any motor.   When i tokk a crank to get dome for the
'61, and when I came back they handed me a thrice turned crank, I said no
beans.  I wanted the standard crank I brought in turned, getting a once over
back.   I didn't go back to that shop.
