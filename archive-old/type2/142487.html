&gt;Wilson says Permatex 3H -- he always says permatex 3H. Almost wonder

FYI, Raby was working on a sealants books but never followed through as far as I know (I don't read STF daily and I can't see it for sale on his website). The last I heard his computer crashed and he lost all the text but you might check with him for advice.
