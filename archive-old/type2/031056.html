&gt; There is more than one quality level of pushrod tube seals (o-rings).  A
&gt; bargain-basement set runs about $5 complete, but you'll be pulling out your
&gt; pushrod tubes more often than you'd like to.  I sell a complete set made of
&gt; Viton(R) which is much more wear resistant, for $14.95.  Considering the
&gt; pain-in-the-a** factor of changing these, it's worth springing for the extra
&gt; few bucks.

I will have to back up this statement, I had some genuine VW originals and
could never get them to stop leaking, dang things drove me to drink.  got
some of the Vitron seals (not even from Ron) and haven't had any leaking
since.
