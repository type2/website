Yes, some corrosion-resistant steels (CRES) are magnetic.  It all depends
upon the alloy you are dealing with.  No &quot;stainless&quot; steel is completely
immune to corrosion, they are just resistant to it.  Making something
completely corrosion resistant sometimes reduces other desirable
properties such as mallerability and formability.  It can also make the
metal more brittle.  This is why quality cooking knives are seldom made
out of stainless.  In terms of mufflers, you want a stainless sheet to
form easily into the muffler shape, yet still be reasonably resistant to
corrosion.  You may see some light corrosion on such a muffler, but not
nearly to the degree of regular steel mufflers.
