Subject: Re:  Compression Ratio and New Heads

Jason:

Answers to your questions:

1. If I buy reman heads from Bus Depot/AVP, do I need to CC them, or is 
this a typical step in the rebuild process?

My experience is that rebuilt AVP heads will probably have combustion 
chamber volumes that are fairly close to each other within the 4 
cylinders.  In other words the volumes of the 4 chambers will likely be 
within 2 cc of each other.  HOWEVER, you won't know WHAT the volumes 
are unless you cc them.  Volumes vary depending on how the heads have 
been remanufactured.  For example, the last set of reman AVP heads I 
purchased cc'd to to about 53 cc.  The brand new AMC heads that I just 
bought measured around 57cc.  That is a significant difference, and it 
directly affects your final static compression ratio.  Maybe you can 
have AVP cc the heads for you before they send them to you.  It would 
save you from having to do it and I would think it likely that they 
have the set-up to do it.


2. If I bolt the heads on without testing CR, am I in danger of getting 
the CR too high, or does the typical rebuilding process take this into 
account?

I would say definitely yes.  Assuming that you want to maintain the 
same compression ratio as your previous heads, you have no guarantee 
that your new reman heads will have the same combustion chamber volume 
as your previous set of heads.


3. If I have combustion chambers that are different, can I put shims 
under one cylinder and not another, or do I need to get them 
re-machined?

I would think not.  Maybe someone more knowledgeable can provide a more 
definitive answer.  From my perspective, you would want all shims used 
for each pair of cylinders to be exactly the same.  If not, you could 
wind up with different cylinder heights (i.e. the distance from the 
sealing surface at the case to the top of the cylinder) resulting in 
head warpage when you torque the heads down.

If you need to adjust head combustion chamber volume between cylinders 
you must find the cylinders with the LOWEST volume and remove metal 
from inside the combustion chamber until the volumes match the cylinder 
that measured the highest volume.  You should be able to do this using 
a dremel tool or die-grinder.  You should be able to find sources in 
the archives/Hoover sermons/etc to tell you where to remove metal.

If your combustion chambers cc to within 1 cc all the way around, but 
your compression ratio is too high, you can drop the compression ratio 
by installing shims under the cylinders between the case and the 
cylinder.  You don't want to put a spacer/gasket between the head and 
the top of the cylinder, so all your shimming should be done at the 
bottom of the cylinder.


4. Can somebody who has done this before give me more insight as to 
what I can look for and avoid?  There are many sources, and many 
different processes.

The main advice that I have to give is that if you want this to last 
longer than 25k, don't guess, take the time to set you compression 
ration correctly.  If nothing else, it will give you peace of mind 
during those long trips.  Determining compression ratio is really not 
complicated, once you get past the jargon.  It is simply the volume of 
the cylinder and combustion chamber with the piston in the down 
position divided by the volume of the cylinder and combustion chamber 
in the up (compression) position.  Use the formula volume = 
(pi)(r-squared)(height) to calculate cylinder/shim volumes.
