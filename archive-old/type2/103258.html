Subject: Re: [T2] pullling the engine

&gt;Anyways the question is, for future reference, where should i place the 
&gt;jack under the engine when I am removing it?

Right under the middle of it - under the round plate in the middle of the 
engine. I like to add a towel or a thin piece of wood to keep the jack from 
gouging up the engine block.

&gt;Also, What is a good item to use when plugging the gas line to the carb?

You can squeeze the hose shut with medical forceps (I believe that is what 
they are called) but I have heard that this will split or weaken the rubber.

I use either a Phillips head screwdriver or a pencil. If need be I use a 
hose clamp to squeeze the hose down on the pencil.

Be sure that your rubber lines have at least a grommet any place where a 
rubber hose passes through the sheetmetal.
