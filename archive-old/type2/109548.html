Subject: Re: [T2] LED Replacements for Tail Lights

I have them in my '77 and they are brighter for sure, but not as wide, they
are a narrow beam of light.

I am not sure if they turn on faster, thats the job of the brake light
switch if you ask me....

They do run 'hot' though, which is something I monitor.

They are a direct replacement, no mods required.....

Worth it? No

Cool? Yes

If you couple them with the clear taillights....

&gt; Has anyone ever tried those LED cluster bulb replacements for tail light
bulbs?  They are supposed to be brighter and turn on faster.
&gt; Autozone has them for $16.00 a pair.  Are they worth it? The rear lights
on my 71 could use more brightness.  Do you have to make any changes, other
than the bulbs, to use them?
