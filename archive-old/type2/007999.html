If you are looking for a book that covers various Bosch fuel injection systems,
including L-Jetronic used on VW buses, I recommend the following:

    Bosch Fuel Injection &amp; Engine Management, by Charles O. Probst, Robert
Bentley

This book goes beyond your buses service manual.  It covers fuel injection
system operational theory, and trouble shooting and service.

Some interesting facts the came out of the book:

  - When the book was published, the L-Jetrontic had the largest
    installed base for port-type fuel injection systems, if you
    include variations manufactured under license from Bosch.

  - The single model with the most L-Jetronic systems installed
    was the VW Bus (235,000), followed by the Beetle at 173,000*

However, you should note that this book is not specific to any one application,
so you still need your regular service manual.
