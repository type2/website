Subject: RE: Under-dash parcel tray

Incase anyone cares.... WCM sells parcel trays  (not originals of course)
for '68-'79 buses. They cost $125.00 for the pair. BusDepot might possibly
sell them for less....

'69 hardtop camper

I've got a set on mine. I've been told they are worth a nice chunk of
&gt; change. Apparently they are dealer items, and there are still dealer
tags on
&gt; mine. Never seen any for sale, although most people who see mine
want some
&gt; for their bus.
