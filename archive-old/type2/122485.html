Hello all. I have a motor from a type 2 1972 VW bus, dual weber (IMPE?)
carbs with intakes, some louvered windows and other misc stuff I wasnt out
of my garage. 1st $100 takes it- I am in N Seattle. Pls respond by calling
my cell at 206-818-6048 as I am not always around a computer. Stuff is
&quot;as-is&quot;, motor was supposed to be a runner but I never saw it do anything
but sit here sinceI lost adead beat roomate that abandoned his project. I
have seen these carbs go for around $50 on ebay.. they are single barrel
guys w/ linkage. Aftermarket intakes for them are embossed &quot;Cb&quot;. Motor is
sitting on my floor, I can help lift and load, if you have a 2wheel dolly
cool but it is only a short walk to the garage door which you could back up
to.
