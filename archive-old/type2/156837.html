Subject: Re: [T2] Sealing a Hightop(converted)

ok ok so heres what took place today....
  i thought and thought about tar rope....
  i did not have tar rope and well also thought about how to lift the top and properly get a seal around it...????? with just my wife and I....????
   
  i found a small can of roof patch(TAR) in the building.... i used a plastic knife to spread a nice neat line where the screw holes were and down the line i went making sure that i got a 1 inch band around screw holes....and in between ....little Tar road..
   
  knowing now the the silicone is bad for metal but figuring its ok for fiberglass i put a small bead of 100 % silicone across the top of the TAR...... and that aways it just touched the tar and the fiberglass.....
   
  to hold the top up i used a cooler sitting on the bed and one of my spare trailer tires on top of the cooler when i lifted up on it the wife gave it a shove and put tire on top of cooler... ............
   
  the front i used a 3 liter pepsi crate and a couple of thick small boards on top of that....
  this simple setup abled me to walk around the bus and take my time putting the bead of tar and silicone.....
   
  sat the top back down and lined it up and screwed in screws and it sucked it down against the mixture there...
   
  i added some new screws in the blank spots and seems to have sealed it up right nicely... it will probadly never come off the bus though but it will suit the one its on for a long time i hope...
   
  thanks for the help Ian i didnt see your post till now ............
   
  also got my little small window done today....
  had to end up using plexiglass for time being cause glass guy is hard guy to catch up with...
  or the one i need to catch....
   
  thanks everyone...
  may she stay sealed and never look like those pictures of Dons  holy crap man... that is scary for a guy just adding a hightop... glad i found the tar.........Sure it isnt what i wanted to use but glad now i did.. thanks for the photos Don.....
   
  peace
  chai

  Ya wanna know what wil really seal up stuff up perfect, very water
proof, won't satain, is permanent, and it isn't silicone ?

It's available at Home Depot, Lowe's, Ace is the Place, which are all
open on Sunday?

Goop, Shoe glue, X-1000 Industrial adhesive, whatever--it's the all the
same.

One tough sealer---works much better than anything else mentioned.
