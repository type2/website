Subject: RE: [T2] Bumper question

I have the standard chrome bumpers and they have lasted pretty good for the past 5 years or so in TN sitting out 365 days a year. Polish often is the key. The final metal prep before the chrome was with a 60 grip sander pad so mine have way too much texture to look GOOD but Ron said way back when he'd replace them for the price of shipping (share the cost) - I THINK - been 5 or 6 years like a said. I thought it was fair but never pursued it. These will be FINE until I get around to repairing/rechoming my OEM Champagne Edition bumpers. MUCH heavier construction than the aftermarket bumpers. 

The black strip is simply black vinyl tape. I'd guess I could buy the same at an electrical supply store.
