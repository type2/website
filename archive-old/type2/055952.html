Subject: Heater Cables How-to's

Hey all.  Just picked up a '69 Micro and it doesn't have any heater 
cables.  During the warm months, does this really matter?  Are the heater 
cables related to cooling the motor?

Anyway, does anybody know of a good &quot;how-to&quot; for installing heater 
cables?  Muir and Hayne's didn't offer much detail.
