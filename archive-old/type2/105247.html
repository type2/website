Subject: Oh Dear! Am I a traitor?

I went out last night and bought a 87 westfalia vanagon, with automatic and 
air!
This is so that Jan feels happy driving it across country.
I guess that it is better than a new eurovan, or a Dodge caravan!

I have been on this list so long that I remember when it was a vanagon type 
list, then split to a type2, then divided into splitties &amp; bays.
Does anyone know if the vanagon list is still going, and are there sidesteps 
available for vanagons?

63 singlecab
(Dove Blue_ Kleine Blau)
70 westy
Now 87 westy vanagon
