Subject: Weird things sucked into the engine...

A paper towel, huh?  Too bad about the engine going kaput.  I had a '67 delivery van front
and back separate, bench seat) hand-converted to a camper(w/o poptop) that somehow sucked
up a plastic Shell credit card that someone had lost on the road.  It got lodged just
right near the fan to make a horrible whirring/clattering noise, kind of like when you
attached playing cards to your bike wheels to make engine noises against your spokes as a
kid.  But I didn't know that at the time.  It sounded like the engine was blowing up.  So,
in the wilds of South Dakota, on a Friday night, with visions of a complete engine rebuild
dancing in my head, I limped into the town campground and camped until the local VW guy
opened on Monday.  Told him the horrible news, and he took the bus into the shop and put
it part-way up on the lift, started it, shut it down, and walked out of the bay about five
minutes later, clutching the semi-shredded credit card and grinning.  It was like
Christmas in July...
