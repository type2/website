And get a quality original muffler.  I imagine that the vendors that
contribute to the List should have quality mufflers, not like the
garbage I got from CalImports.  You could practically stick your
finger into the fresh air couplings that wraps around the pipes that
connect to 2 and 4 exhaust ports where the coupling is supposed to
seal tight to the pipe.  When I called them about this, I was told
that this is how it is with Brazilian mufflers.

&gt;If you have a stock engine here's the short &quot;upright exhaust&quot; 
&gt;guide...please
&gt;get a stock exhaust!!! Use copious amounts of penetrant on the head 
&gt;studs
&gt;and care in removal.  Likewise use a bunch of anti-seize on every 
&gt;nut and
&gt;bolt in reassembly.
&gt;
&gt;The correct parts for a 68-71 are:
&gt;211 298 009A muffler kit
&gt;211 298 055 damper to tail pipe kit
&gt;211 251 301A bracket
&gt;211 251 051 E muffler
&gt;147 251 157 damper pipe
&gt;211 251 237B tail pipe

&gt;Although still solid (knock on wood) one of these days my original, 
&gt;33 year
&gt;old muffler is gonna need replacing.  I know that I need to get the 
&gt;proper,
&gt;single tail pipe exhaust, but after browsing lots of Vendor's sites 
&gt;there's
&gt;terms/nomenclature I don't understand.  The library didn't help 
&gt;since those
&gt;articles deal with the TypeIV engine.  Does anyone have an &quot;upright 
&gt;exhaust
&gt;for dummies&quot; article?  It would be nice to read about everything 
&gt;including
&gt;aftermarket/performance parts and how they differ from stock.
