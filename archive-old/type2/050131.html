Subject: [T2] Extreme Cold Driving

Last week I took Kermit my '76 Westy camping in single digit temps.  Wind
chills were in the -20 degree range and Kermit wasn't happy.  I have a VDO
oil temp gauge so I decided to get wild and crazy with the remarkable wonder
we all call duct tape.  I completey (and neatly) duct taped over the air
vents on the top back corners of the bus.  Before taping the vents I was
running around 160-170 degrees, freezing in the cabin, and Kermit was
running quite lousy.  After the duct tape the oil temp went up to about 190
degrees, the frost on the windows dissappeared, my feet thawed out, and
Kermit ran better than he had for two days.  A friend and I cracked a head
on his '78 camper a couple of years ago on a New Years Day kayaking trip to
the mountains of West Virginia.  The mechanic said it was probabably because
the extremely cold weather never allowed the heads to heat up properly which
is just as damaging as heating up too much.  Can't say for sure because we
didn't have an oil temp gauge.  I do recall it being too cold to keep frost
off the windshield.  I would encourage anybody who drives in temps below
20-30 degrees to install an oil temp and use this method.  I still have the
duct tape on and around town I still stay below 190 degrees.  Once it warms
up past 30 degrees I will probably remove a couple of strips of tape from
the vents or untape one side completely.  I'm probably not the first to try
duct tape for this, but I just wanted to let you know my observations.  Good
Luck and keep warm.
