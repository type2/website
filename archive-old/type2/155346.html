Subject: Doghouse cooler

I picked up a 1500 sp engine yesterday. The engine code leads me to 
believe that it was out of a '68 beetle. 30 pict 1 carb. No sloppy lash 
in the distributor, which strikes me as a very good sign. I'll know 
more when I tear the engine down and inspect pistons, valves. etc/

Thinking ahead a little, I wonder how worthwhile it would be to upgrade 
to a doghouse cooler. I live in the northeast (Maine) and will probably 
be driving my bus on back roads, 50 to 60 mph, no desert or southern 
heat. Some highway travel, some occasional mountain travel (White 
Mountains, Green Mountains, Adirondacks -- not western mountains). A 
doghouse upgrade is probably always worthwhile, but maybe less 
worthwhile in some cases than in others/
