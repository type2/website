&gt;hey listees, I've about pulled my remaining hair out trying to figure out

&gt;finally settled on one that makes it run better than the other 2 but it 
&gt;still gets lousy mileage.  It came with 55's, I tried 45's (that made it 
&gt;buck like mad upon acceleration).  I finally put 50's in it and it runs

Sounds like you are changing idle jets.  There is more to carb efficiency 
than just idle jets.  You need to think about your main jets, air 
correction jets, and accelerator pump also.  Disassemble one of your carbs 
and determine ALL of the sizes and then start reading.

&gt;it has an electric fuel pump on it although I don't know the brand or any 
&gt;of the particulars.  Should I try putting a fuel pressure regulator on it 
&gt;to see if that helps?

Nope, unless your fuel pressure exceeds 3psi.  What is your fuel pressure?
