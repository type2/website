Subject: Re: [T2] Wheel bearing or something else?

Hi Brian,

If you have any side-to-side or in-and-out play in your rear wheels, it's 
most likely your wheel bearings.  If your Bus has a lot of miles on it and 
the rear wheel bearings haven't been replaced, chances are they will need it 
soon if they don't already need it.

If everything else on your rear wheels is tight (shock, diagonal arm, spring 
plate, brake drum) and you still have play in the wheel, it's most likely 
your bearings.

Good luck!
