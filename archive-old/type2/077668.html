Subject: RE: [T2] another emissions question

Hmmmm....  I live near Philadelphia, in Delaware County.  My 71 does not
need to get tested at all, just the annual safety inspection (brakes,
lights, etc.).  I wonder what the cutoff year is?

&gt; I register the Westy at my farm, 120 miles from Dallas TX.
&gt; I get about 65% insurance discount and no tailpipe inspections.

I wish I were so lucky. I am in the opposite situation.  We live in a rural
area of Pennsylvania, among lots of farms and only a few modern
&quot;neighborhoods&quot; so far. Our nearest cities are smaller ones (Reading and
Allentown), where insurance is cheap and there is no emissions testing. But
despite our close proximity to those cities, we are (by 2 miles) within
Montgomery County, a large county that extends all the way to the border of
Philadelphia an hour away.  Because our county borders on Philadelphia, the
state considers us to be in suburban Philadelphia, despite the fact that we
are nowhere near it. So I pay twice as much for insurance as I would if I
lived 2 miles up the road, and have to pass rather stringent emissions tests
each year. :-(
