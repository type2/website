Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Stuck Locks

Hi Ginny,

Suggestion:

Remove the driver's side front turnsignal and drill out the rivets  
holding in the reflector underneath. Then you will have a clear path  
to reach inside the bus with a long wire and pop open the door lock  
from the inside. A cordless drill with a quarter-inch bit will take  
the head off all 4 rivets in no time at all.

Once you're in you can remove the door handles and repair them at  
your leisure.


Happy trails,

&gt; Thanks to all who replied.  Will be trotting off to Canadian Tire  
&gt; to find some
&gt; PB Blaster - hope we have it up here -.  Really want to unlock the  
&gt; bus to look
&gt; inside, to see what I have.  Can't even open the engine.
