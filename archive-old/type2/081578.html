Subject: Re: [T2] Busted for Speeding!

I was cruising east for a New Year surf, having recently had a new engine
fitted, and kept up with a freinds Ford Galaxy Turbo deisel... at 70 mph....
he shot off over the hills in Devon (south west UK)... he had only got out
of the car and was stretching when we caught up with him at the Surfed Out
shop in Saunton..... the look of suprise on his face.... and the body of my
van in such a mess...  (http://www.wognum.co_dot_uk/breeze01.html take a look at
the painted bus.... no the one with too many colours)...  Still the guys in
the surf shop spent an hour pouring over it while I poured over their
Baja....

&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt;
&gt; I thought you all would get a kick out of this.  Yesterday, I was out for
a
&gt; drive in my 1979 Westy, and I got pulled over for speeding!  The officer
was
&gt; pretty cool and she said, &quot;I didn't think those things could go that fast!
&gt; When I saw you doing 72 on the radar, I couldn't believe it.&quot;  I was
clocked
&gt; doing 72 in a 55 zone, but I'm sure the officer also wanted to pull me
over
&gt; to ask about my Bus.
&gt;
&gt; I recently installed a Jake Raby 2.0L FI engine, and I noticed how much
more
&gt; powerful it was over my old engine.  I was thinking that it would get me
in
&gt; trouble, and I guess I was right.  It was a good check for me, and it was
&gt; also a good check for my speedometer -- it was reading 75 when I passed
the
&gt; officer.
&gt;
&gt; Fortunately, I got off with a written warning, but I now have radar
&gt; confirmation and written proof that my Bus will as fast as a &quot;normal&quot; car!
&gt;
&gt; Anybody else have any stories of fast Buses and surprised passengers or
&gt; onlookers?
