Subject: Re: [T2] electrical gremlins and kvetching.

well got the beast assembled and back together but still having running
problems.  have done all the standard tests and today took the crane
ignition out and put the old points back in this 78 stock engine and auto
tranny bus......

  however it has been a long time and there seems to be a conflict in the
Bentley vs the VW Fuel Injection trouble shooting manual.

is 1 or 15 plus on the coil??

which one plus oor minus does the condensor go on. the Bentley appears to
show it on the plus side but the FI manual shows it on the negative side
of the coil.   ???? haven't used points in years so can't remember. but
booy is this engine runnning rough....got compression, got fuel presure
got all the right components etc.
