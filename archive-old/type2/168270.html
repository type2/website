Subject: Side window seal

For the second time on a row, I have opened my door to find that water is
draining out of it! I figure it is because the water that it hitting my side
roll-down windows is simply dibbling down to the bottom and the running out
the door when I open it.

What is that felt-ish seal called that rubs up against your windows when you
roll them up and down? Anyone else replaced it? Common deal? Easy to
replace? Anyone for tennis?

Mahalo ya.
