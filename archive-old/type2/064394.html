        Hi; 
just wanted to add one more thing to the string on c.v.'s

After cleaning, air drying, and reassembling your c.v.s', put them in the
oven for a while.  When I did mine, some one gave me this advice and it
worked like a charm. 

Put the assembled unit (no grease or boots) in the oven. use the lowest 
setting or slightly higher and leave the door cocked open a little.  
Heating the joints like this causes any left over solvent or moisture to 
evaporate.  I think It took about 15 minutes before I couldn't smell any 
more solvent vapor comming from the oven.
        WARM (not hot) and dry is the key.  I don't know what would happen
if you got them too hot but I'm sure it would be BAD. I never let mine get
hotter than what I can safely pick up. Other than that precaution, it is a
simple and effective method for removing excess solvent and condensation. 

good luck.  
Ed.
