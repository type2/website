Subject: '72 VW Westy FS - Fairfax VA

The decision is made.  The '72 Westy will go.  $2,500 or $2,750, your choice 
(hint: take the $2,750!!)

Please see this site for info I have linked to next weekend's Washington 
Post ad:

http://www.angelfire_dot_com/ab8/bus/1972/   I will take more pictures and post 
as I continue to get the '72 ready to receive visitors.

Basically, it is a 89K mile Westfalia that has been in my garage and worked 
on as a part time project for the past 4 years.  The engine is ready (you 
can eat off it), except for the carbs - that is the stopper.

The brakes are done (rebuilt calipers w/new hardware and pads; rotors 
turned; rebuilt master cylinder; four new brake hoses; new rear wheel 
cylinders, thick brake shoes)

The interior is excellent.  It has very good paneling/roof and that is what 
attracted me to the '72 in the first place.

Electrical and transmission are unknow, since the '72 hasn't had a battery 
inside for the past 12 years.  [Battry tray,installed, is Bus Depot new.]

I thank all the people in the past who helped me to get this '72 on the 
road.  I am sorry I could not complete my project.  It is now someone else's 
turn to care for this '72
