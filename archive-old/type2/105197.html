Subject: Re: [T2] New and looking

Be sure to drive that older VW bus and see if it does what you want to.

By the time I got done revamping the suspension, the brakes, and the 
drivetrain, it wouldn't be a splitty anymore - it would be a late bay. 
So... we bought a late bay to begin with &lt;grin&gt;.

The splitties have the looks though.

To be sure I drove a splitty once and my mind was made up. I like to drive 
my '78 Westy and look at the splitties.
