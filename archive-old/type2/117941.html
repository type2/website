Subject: Re: [T2] Engine deck lid

Hi Folks,

I think the engine lid changed sometime around the change from the T1 to the 
T4 engine, so that would put it around '72 or '73.  I remember my friend's 
'71 engine lid was different from mine, and I got to look at his a lot as we 
trekked our way across Utah on US-50.  So, your '77 lid will probably not 
fit on your friend's '69, unless it does....

Good luck!

 &gt;I think the change in deck lids (beyond the coathanger wire hinge) was in 
'71...
