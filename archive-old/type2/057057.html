I don't know if Chirco is a VW only place or what, but if you are just
asking for rings and they don't know anything about the engine they are
going on, there are a few other measurements they might require.  One is
the thickness of the ring, and the other is the true diameter of the
piston.  Often when engines are rebuilt, the cylinders are bored out and
oversized pistons are fitted.  This is not often the case with VW engines,
but I have seen it happen.  I had a vanagon engine that was rebuilt by VW
of Canada and it had oversized pistons in it (about 94.4 instead of 94, I
believe).

You should really break out the vernier/dial caliper and measure the
pistons (diameter) and the old rings (thickness) before ordering to avoid
costly mistakes.  In lieu of the old rings you can measure the ring gap in
the piston.
