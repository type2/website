I just wanted to thank everyone for their $.02 in helping me figure out my 
non-starting '77 Westy--which, by the way, was worth a hell of a lot more 
than .02 since I would have had to paid to have her towed, and then fixed by 
a beligerant VW mechanic who would for sure overcharge me....for just a 
coil!  Yep, turned out to be the coil--she fired right up.  Anyhow, thanks 
again to everyone--does anyone know of a bus gathering anytime this summer 
in the midwest?
