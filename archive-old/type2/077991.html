Subject: Favor to ask of you

I have entered my Bus in a contest through Rustoleum (since I used
their product to paint my Bus) and have a chance to win $100.00 if my
project gets the most votes.  The down fall is that you have to
register to vote which requires a name and email address.  If you
wouldn't mind doing that please go to 
http://www.paintideas_dot_com./category.asp?ProjCatCode=vote 
and click on the word vote under the picture of my Bus.  I could use
the $100.00 for.... more VW Parts.  You can vote every 24 hours so if
you really want to help me out?  

Thanks,

Kevin
