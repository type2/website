Subject: 46 Bug: Oldest Privately owned in U.S.?

Hi All,

Our local Kansas Chapter of the Vintage VW Club of America (VVWCA) had a
picnic get together at a member's house last Sunday afternoon. This
particular member has the luck to own 2 unrestored, particularly Vintage
VW's:  A 1950 Convertible and a 'November' 1946 Bug.  Turns out next month
is the 46's 50th Birthday, so the co-editors (myself included) will be
having a special Birthday feature in next months's issue on this pale
yellow time machine.  3 of the tires are the originals and the jack even
has the 'cog' VW symbol on it!  8-)

My question to y'all is:  Does anyone know of any Bugs with a prodection
date older than Nov. 1946 that is privately owned and in particular,
unrestored?
