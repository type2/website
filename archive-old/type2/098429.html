Subject: Re: [T2] Dropping T4 engine, without tranny questions.

I just put my type 4 engine back _in_ my bus last week, so I have an idea.  We supported the tranny with a small jack, but if the trans carrier plate is in place (a 4&quot;x1.5&quot; rectangle with two bolts through it), you shouldn't have to.  Yes, remove the oil filler neck.  And thirdly, get help only if you think you need it.  Personally, we had two people working, one to guide and eyeball while the other wiggled the engine back.  The second person doesn't necessarily have to know more than you, but just be able to lend muscular assistance or stop the engine if something goes amiss.  
Sounds like a fun weekend project.  Although clutch only should only take a couple hours max. 
Peace, 
Charles
