I've heard that there is a conversion kit available to transform the &quot;upstairs&quot; cot
sleeping arrangement in older Westies (mine is a 1972) to a full size bed.  Does
anyone know about this and how I might obtain some information about it??

Has anyone been successful at creating a full bed out of the cot configuration?
 
Thanks,

Dale G
