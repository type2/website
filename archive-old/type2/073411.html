&gt;I stand by my original statement.  OEM Porsche sump plate senders are not
&gt;even
&gt;close to what's commonly used.

OEM Porsche sump plate senders are used on every 914-4 that was ever
produced - that makes them &quot;commonly used&quot; in my book.

&gt;A better way to say the same thing might be something like:
&gt;There are some oil temp senders that work the way they should and I believe
&gt;one is the OEM Porsche sump plate senders.  They work better because blaa
&gt;blaa blaa.  They can be purchased at blaa blaa blaa.

You could just have easily explained why you think each kind of sender
&quot;commonly used&quot; on the bus is a piece of junk, but you didn't.  If you feel
like debating the structure of my posts, fine but let's take it offline in
the future.

&gt;Isn't the purpose of this list to pass on our hard won knowledge to help our
&gt;brother/sister bus owners?

Absolutely.  That's why I was compelled to follow up to your post with my
opinion, which is that the Porsche sump plate sender is accurate and useful.

&gt;&gt; An expensive bit of insurance, that.
&gt;
&gt;Not at all when you consider the cost and inconvenience of having to replace
&gt;an engine in an emergency situation

You're assuming it *will* happen that way if you don't run 89.  My
experience tells me otherwise.  If 89 is better than 87, then 93 must be
even better, right?  Why not run 93?  It would be even more insurance,
would it not?  Cost less than a new engine, would it not?  Why not run 105
octane race gas?  It's only $5/gallon.  Where do you draw the line, and why?

&gt;By the way where do you get fuel that is lower than 87?

High elevation cities such as Gallup, NM..  Detonation is not as much of a
problem in higher elevation because compression is reduced, therefore there
is not as great of a need for high octane.
