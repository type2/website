Subject: i hate fuel pumps
Message-ID: &lt;6aeec62d.24539ff3_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Well, after replacing my mechanical fuel pump once, then cleaning out the 
tank best i could without removing it, checking fuel lines, and replaceing 
the push rod, I have determined that my new mechanical fuel pump has broken 
on me, so instead of buying a new one I am saying to hell with the entire 
mechanical fuel pump world and going to buy an eletric one, what type should 
I buy, how do I set them up, do I need some special pressure regulator, why 
did I buy this bus in the first place?

Please give me a hand, hopefully this will solve my never ending fuel problem 
quest.
