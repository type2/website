Subject: RE: [T2] Metal Fuel Hose

Is there anything exceptional about the steel line, or would a hardware
store find meet the need? (back story) DPO pulled the lines, and most
of the rubber on the tank venting system when the Weber was installed.
I noticed the missing rubber while swapping out the old 009. No, this
isn't a joke, but it is starting to sound like one. Anyway, there are a
few sections of steel line missing, the most notable is the missing
line through the firewall. With the nice weather, I'm biking and
leaving the bus in the driveway, so there is no immediate fire threat.
Regardless, I'm planning to replace the rubber lines shortly (next
couple of weeks) and acquiring the missing steel is an important
preliminary step. Making the Hoover bulkhead fitting will kinda require
one of these pipes too...
TIA,

&gt; FIX THAT RIGHT AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
&gt; Use brake line if you have to.
&gt; Or I am sure someone has spare metal line to send you.
&gt; Then wrap some fuel hose (slit) around it to shield the metal through
&gt; the tin hole.
&gt; You are risking a bus fire in the most usual way!
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; I noticed my engine does not have a metal tube that passes through
&gt; the 
&gt; front engine tin.  The fuel line just passes through the tin.  
&gt; 
&gt; What solutions are available to build/aquire the tube that goes
&gt; throught
&gt; 
&gt; the tine.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
