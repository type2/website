Subject: Re: Westfalia Insurance

I got AAA and it's like 350 a year for my 76 westy.  That's only
liability, not anything else.  And I'm 23 if it makes any difference.

&gt; I was wondering if anyone could help me out. I'm having a heck of a
&gt; time finding someone who will insure me for my 79 Westfalia. I have
&gt; given them terms like type II, Westfalia, Campmobile, camper, but
&gt; they are unable to insure it. Can anyone tell me who they are insured
&gt; with?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks.
