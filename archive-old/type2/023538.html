&gt; Hey there --
&gt; 
&gt; I recently put some sound into my 76 westy and am *very* happy with the
&gt; results.
&gt; 
&gt; CD: blaupunkt las vegas in dash (this are flying out the door for $199
&gt; from http:www.crutchfield_dot_com) I didn't get mine quite that cheap but imho
&gt; the blaupunkt is a nice way to go in the VW. The styling fits in well and
&gt; I love the auxiliary input for a walkman in case I want to listen to a
&gt; book on tape or whatever). I also put blaupunkt 6.5&quot; speakers in the
&gt; doors. I wired through some existing channels where the door meets the
&gt; body (below the hinge). I wired 6x9s in the back by burying a channel
&gt; beneath the carpet along the sill near the sliding door. The actual rear
&gt; speaker installation was some work: I removed the small door beneath the
&gt; bench seat and took some MDF (medium density fiberboard) and fashioned a
&gt; new front panel slightly larger than the opening. I made cut outs for the
&gt; 6x9s, covered the board with some scrap black speaker box material from
&gt; the local car audio place, and front mounted the speakers. The board
&gt; screws on to the bench seat panel with four *tiny* woodscrews.. sniff..
&gt; 
&gt; So far I've kept everything pretty close to stock. cutting the front doors
&gt; was the worst (most painful) part but it was worth it for the better sound
&gt; possible from the big front speakers. I do not recommend mounting in the
&gt; kickpanels because the weight of the speaker could pull the kickpanel out
&gt; of its guide (not to mention some clearance problems).
&gt; 
&gt; That resulted in some *very* good sound up front with the right deck
&gt; tuning -- the blaupunkt is a nice enough deck that you can make this
&gt; happen.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's where things got excessive though:
&gt; 
&gt; I got a *great* deal on a someone's traded-in amplifier and 10&quot; Kicker
&gt; subwoofer w/bandpass enclosure. I mounted the amp (200W bridged) beneath
&gt; the bench seat on top of the box containing the 110V outlets/fuse/switch
&gt; and just put the small sub box in the &quot;way back&quot; area for now. Eventually
&gt; I am thinking of transforming half of the hanging cabinet into a sealed
&gt; sub enclosure -- I would need to add an &quot;internal&quot; box on the left side
&gt; (front is front) of the cabinet to dampen vibration and I do not relish
&gt; cutting any more holes in my bus but I have a decent plan for doing so if
&gt; and when the somewhat bulky sub box gets on my nerves. For now I can pull
&gt; the box out if necessary and the rest of the time this system is pretty
&gt; damn impressive -- all for ~$500 parts. 
&gt; 
&gt; Admittedly that is an outrageous amount of money for an audio system in a
&gt; bus but an order of magnitude less than many people spend in their
&gt; vehicles and it's been a long time ambition to have a such a kickin'
&gt; system. I mostly don't play it loud but I have to admit cranking up (list
&gt; ___ your favorite artist here i.e. Ben Harper in my case) can give one
&gt; cool goosebumps. My bus=fun for me and I got a good enough deal on it
&gt; including post-buy parts and labor to just barely afford the indulgent
&gt; additional expenditure on sound.  I probably should have bought a propane
&gt; heater instead but I wouldn't have a bought a T2 if I was looking for the
&gt; most practical vehicle, eh? In other words, I am only marginally
&gt; conflicted ;) I really enjoyed figuring out how to put everything in and
&gt; getting the cost/value quotient to a place I could live with. More than
&gt; anything I guess I appreciate the humor? dichotomy? // whatever of a
&gt; clearly 70s styled rig with such a 90s style sound track &lt;g&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I put a lot of time into thinking about how to design the layout and am
&gt; very happy with the results. Again, I highly recommend the Blaupunkt deck
&gt; and the close out price is amazing! (I've never bought anything from
&gt; crutchfield and their service may be poor but the price is right ymmv) If
&gt; anyone has questions about the installation, or more importantly insights
&gt; to share with me I am most appreciative.
&gt; 
&gt; rock on otherwise!
&gt; 
&gt; Jamie
&gt; 
&gt; ps. Part of why I could afford this was my escape from an engine rebuild.
&gt; You probably all know this and I had heard it but still wasn't careful
&gt; enough --&gt; for any other neophytes out there *check your valve clearance
&gt; BEFORE you do a compression test* believe me, you may be much happier with
&gt; the results...
