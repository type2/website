Subject: Finally tried the Nokians in snow

Nokian Hakkapelliita CQ 185R14 Loadrange &quot;D&quot;

I didn't have anything really nasty or hazardous that
I HAD to drive in, but I went up to the mountains
today and finally got the chance to try these babies
out. Throughout a sampling of compact snow and soft
snow about 4&quot; deep and a couple little &quot;encounters&quot;
with easily a foot or more... The best way I can
describe these tires is that the &quot;confidence&quot; they
invoke in these conditions is akin to a really good
set of street tires on rainy blacktop. I just had no
reason to doubt them at any time. They did surprise me
at first and there were several instances that
certainly would have required rocking or maybe even
shoveling with the Cooper Discoverer M&amp;S I've been
using for several years and with these tires I just
pulled away with no effort - like starting off on wet
blacktop!

I suspect that hardpacked snow with a layer of melt on
top will offer them a real challenge - I thankfully
had nothing of that order to negotiate today. I have
heard these tires highly praised by some drivers for
whom I have great respect and so my expectations were
extremely high. From what I experienced today, I can
say that thus far they have exceeded my most extreme
expectations. As winter goes on and I make several
more jaunts into the mountains, I'm sure I will have
opportunities to test them beyond what most sane
people  ever would - and if I survive, I'll be sure to
report my findings! So far - They are simply
outstanding! -BaH
