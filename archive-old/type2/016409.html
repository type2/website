Hi Peter,

You'll find Tobin and Crista's Buyer's Checklist on my WetWesties site.
http://members.tripod_dot_com/~wetwesties/  It is easily the most complete listing
of what to look for/at ever compiled. 

In answer to your question about what to call it, a '79 is a:

Breadloaf
Bay window
Type 2 T2
Bus (if it has windows)
Van (if it doesn't)
Transporter


Good luck, and welcome aboard!

&gt;  Just got back from looking at a '79 Type 2 Cargo Van. Have
&gt; had nothing to do with Air Cooled Vans before. Lot's of
&gt; Bugs, but no Vans.
&gt;  Went to Bus Depots page to get some tips as to what to
&gt; watch out for in a '79, also searched the Library and the
&gt; Archives. Now that I've had a look at all of them I have a
&gt; few questions!
&gt;  PO says it has'nt been run in 5 years. He tried to start it
&gt; awhile ago and says it would only run *on starting fluid and
&gt; WD-40*???????? What's up with that? Fuel Pump?
&gt;  It appears to have a fair bit of surface rust, but, no
&gt; perforations yet. The VW Emblem is gone from the front (of
&gt; course), and it has not been butchered in any way other than
&gt; a set of giant driving lights bolted to the front bumper.
&gt;  The things the Bus Depot page says to look out for appear
&gt; to not be too bad.
&gt;  The engine turns over fine, so, I hope that the *starting
&gt; fluid and WD-40* have not done any damage(washing the
&gt; cylinder walls of oil, etc.). The oil level is to the top
&gt; line on the dipstick, but is very thick and very black.
&gt;  Suggestions and Comments, Hints, Tips and Ideas on
&gt; purchasing and/or troubleshooting as well as what to look
&gt; out for, are requested and would be greatly appreciated.
&gt; Subscribed to the list just a few hours ago, so reply's can
&gt; be sent to me directly!!!!!!!!
&gt;  What is the proper term to call this Van? Breadloaf? Bay?
&gt; Transporter? Cargo Van? T2?
&gt;  There are 234,000 km. on the odometer.
&gt;  Oh yeah, the price on the Van is $1200.00 O.B.O. Canadian
