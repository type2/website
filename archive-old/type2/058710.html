Subject: Pt Lookout Campout

So, whats happening at Scotland, MD (Pt Lookout State Park) on the
weekend of 2-3 Oct 98.

Well, seems a bunch of busses are going to camp around the campfire, and
perhaps visit St Mary's City, MD.  Like . . .

               Historic St. Mary's City
      The Museum at the Site of Maryland's 17th-Century Capital

     October 3 &amp; 4 * Woodland Indian Culture Days 

     At the Woodland Indian site, discover and celebrate Indian culture
with demonstrations, and hands-on opportunities for the entire family.
Storytelling, flintknapping, archery, face-painting, and more, including
fun Make 'n Take activities. 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

  And with a little sweet talk, possibly the group can get the weekend
guide to open the famous lighthouse at the point.  (This year, the
single annual opening is scheduled for Nov 7th, but special arrangements
can be made...)

  Last count, -8- reservations have been made.  Talk to Miss Bobbie, at
301 872 5688.  Ask her or the ranger on duty about a special opening of
the light house !!

  P. S.  Pt Lookout State Park's famous GHOST WALK is scheduled for
23-24 Oct this year.  Out family went 2 years ago, and that was truly a
memorable over_nighter.
