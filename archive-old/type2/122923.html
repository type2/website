Subject: Dual Carb Gaskets?

Hello,

How many gaskets are there between the carb and the intake manifold?

If I am correct there is a rubber type gasket that sits on top of the 
manifold , then a regular gasket then the carb. Is this right?

I have a 1700 dual carb engine.

Thanks in advance, Phil.
