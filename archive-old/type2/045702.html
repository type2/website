piggybacking off Jim:

&gt; There was a little nutty guy at the VW Auburn Hills show this past Spring
&gt; that claimed to have a kit to convert a air cooled bus to water cooled using
&gt; all original Mexican bus parts. He even had a converted bus there to show
&gt; off.  Price tag without installation?  $5,000.

Why does this sound outrageously high to me?
