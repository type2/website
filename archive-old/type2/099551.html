Subject: Re: [T2] Bus sighting [It's Friday]

Watch &quot;1969&quot;. Winona Ryder again.

Rough splitty all through that movie and a pretty cool Corvair 'vert too.


&gt;another nice splitty sighting: the movie called Girl:Interrupted starring
&gt;Winona Rider (recently indigted on shoplifting charges). if i recall
&gt;correctly it is a two-tone (orange/brown?), her and her friend bum a ride
&gt;from some cats who smoke them up and drop them off 'further on down the
&gt;line'. good flick.
