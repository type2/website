&gt;The time has come to sell my beloved '81 Vanagon Westfalia.

This is a very sad day. I am depressed, hate stuff like this.

It is a lovely camper, any of the hundreds of listees who have seen it will
back me up. And comes with a very noble pedigree from an honest owner who
has earned guru status over the years. You'd be the only guy on three bus
lists who wasn't cursing the DPO if you bought it.

This just sucks...
