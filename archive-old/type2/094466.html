&gt; I've seen various late Baywindow buses with either Girling or ATE calipers. It
&gt; seems that VW used whichever brand of calipers that they happened to have in
&gt; stock at the moment. My '79 had Girling calipers when I rebuilt the brake
&gt; system. I couldn't locate rebuilt Girling calipers at the time, but ATE
&gt; calipers were plentiful, so I used ATE instead. I had to replace the short
&gt; pieces of steel brake line that screw into the calipers with some new ones I'd
&gt; bent to fit, but otherwise it went pretty smoothly.

I believe this is correct.  For the record, my 78 has ATE calipers.  Perhaps
someone else with a 78 and the Girling brand could confirm this.
