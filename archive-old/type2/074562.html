Mmmm,well so's Ford.
The minister from my church found out the hard way
that they hadn't cleaned all of the sand from the
casting process out of the engine block.....in North
Western Queensland(Australia) when the ambient
temperature was 42 degrees Celcius or well over 100
farenheit.
The engine seized and every piece of rubber or plastic
fused to the engine.
He got NO support or re-imbursement.
The car was 2 years old.
Lets face it....the corporations SUCK.

&gt; &gt; We have had alot of Hondas and currently own one
&gt; we bought new. Hate to
&gt; &gt; tell you this but Honda has been doing the same
&gt; thing that VW has been
&gt; &gt; doing to after market suppliers and web site
&gt; owners.
&gt; 
&gt; Add Mazda to that list. You know that neat little
&gt; &quot;Miata&quot; script they use to
&gt; mark their roadsters? Those guys are ultra
&gt; protective of that little script.
&gt; Not the word Miata, strangely enough, just the
&gt; script.
