Hello everyone,

BBTA was a great success, and I promise I will eventually post a 
&quot;debrief&quot; on how it went as soon as the dust settles around here.  
But right now I wanted to alert those of you who attended that a 
great friend of ours, and perhaps of yours, who attended BBTA 
and was visiting a bit longer with Kathryn and I has been hospitalized 
here in St. Louis.  

Sue Smith and Ted Cheney of Westerville, Ohio always visit BBTA 
and stay on for a few days with the Bowman's.  They attended in a 
pale yellow early 80's Vanagon Westfalia, and own many other nice 
Type 2's and other VW's.  On Monday evening Sue, who has a past 
history of heart ailments, became rather ill again, and I rushed her in 
our car to a nearby hospital.  She was admitted to the ICU with 
congestive heart failure and is recovering.  Although weak, she looks 
much better as of Tuesday evening.  We expect she will stay and rest 
in the hospital until sometime Friday when she might be released to 
return to us and then eventually home.

For those of you who just met this wonderful lady (and Ted too) or who 
may have known them all along, I'd like to ask that you give her a call 
during reasonable hours at Barnes-Jewish St. Peters Hospital ICU at 
(314) 916-9751 or -9752.  While recovering, I'm sure she'd be delighted 
to hear from her friends, old and new.  They've never been on e-mail 
or this list, but if you'd prefer to send her a &quot;get well&quot; message, send 
it to my e-mail address above and I'll pass them on to her.  Thanks 
for your thoughfulness in advance!

Thanks to all of Sue and Ted's friends in advance, and thanks to all of 
you who attended BBTA #14 and made it so much fun!
