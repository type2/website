Subject: Re: [T2] Yellowstone &amp; Glacier Nat. Parks [Was: Vacation travels]

&gt;...Yellowstone is way crowded, and getting worse as the NPS &quot;improves&quot; things... 

Glacier is beautiful.  Stay in East Glacier (Sears Motel is reasonable
and bus-friendly) and go over the pass early in the day for the best lighting on the Going-to-the-Sun road.&lt;
---------------------------

We anticipated crowds in Yellowstone on our last trip there, the last week of August, but were surprised to find relatively few people.  Rangers and others explained that many schools start in late August so most of the families had cleared out by then.

Glacier NP and adjacent Waterton Lakes NP in Canada are joined as an &quot;International peace park&quot;.  There's a gorgeous campground by the small townsite of Waterton, right on the lakeshore.  Lots of trees and grass, marvelous views, and only a couple of blocks from the town center and its amenities.  

Waterton Lakes is lightly used in comparison to Glacier or Yellowstone, and the facilities make those in the US NPs look pretty pathetic.  In a long lifetime of camping in the West, the CG in Waterton is definitely on my top 10 list.  And its close enough to Glacier [by road] to be a handy alternative to scrounging for a campsite on the East side of Glacier NP.
