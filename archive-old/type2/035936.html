&gt;It would be a useful list project to determine what parts are still

Guaranteed, different dealers in different areas and regions will give
different prices. All pricing will be designed to meet the needs of their
particular organization. Priorities and focus vary greatly amonst large and
small dealers, some heavily promoting the service dept., some not, some
heavily promoting the parts dept., some not, you get the picture.

I suggest that every time someone buy a Dealer Part, they send a post
giving part no./price/dealer info. You could then search the archive by
part no. for info on past purchases. Within a few months, if most followed
through, all the replacement parts typically needed could be found, and in
a few years, reference would be available for just about anything
available, and from several dealers in several regions and countries and
continents.
