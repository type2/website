Wait a second, George - you mean to tell me that there are buses that can go even FASTER than 58 on
the freeway?  Amazing! ; )

Actually, I wonder if I would WANT to...I might have to venture out of the slow lane, and that
sounds too scary to contemplate...

Well, I've always been happy with my 1600dp, but I don't know if I would
want to step down from the Big Power of the 78's type IV.  If climbing
hills at 35MPH and cruising at 58MPH is OK by you a type I will keep you
happy.  If you want more, go type IV,

George
