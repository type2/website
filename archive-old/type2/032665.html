Subject: Coil, EGR Filter or None of the Above?

Hey All,

I am still new to doing my own maintenance, and I need some help with a 1976 
FI Westy,aka Yellie.

After having followed the Muir guide to find out why it stalls out after it is 
warmed up.  I am left with the following dilemna.

It starts up after about two attempts and runs fine for about 15 miles.  After 
that if I slow down to 2nd gear or stop it will stall unless I continually 
pump her with some gas.  If it does stall out, I usually need to wait about 
30-45 minutes to rest/cool off/decide she's ready.  Then she'll start up and 
run me to final destination.  Where I almost made to....

Everything in the Muir book checked out except that when checking the spark 
from the coil the spark was orange (&quot;OK for now but needs to be 
replaced&quot;--Muir).  
The other recommendation had to do with the EGR filter.  Since Muir didn't 
have much on that, I went to Bentley.  According Bentley my chassis number 
indicates that I have the later EGR system.  However, when looking at my 
engine, it appears that I have the earlier version EGR system installed.  The 
kicker is that either way, I cannot find the EGR filter anywhere.

My question(s)are: Would having a weak coil cause the stalling and not 
starting problem?  Is that fact that I don't appear to have an EGR filter 
causing it? Is it some combination of the two? Or am I following a red herring 
here?

Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.
