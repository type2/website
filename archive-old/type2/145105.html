Subject: [T2]Fuel filler hose

my fuel filler hose has busted and well i gotta replace it but cant find it anywheres unless the name for it is diffrent than that....
   
  it is the hose that connects to the gas tank and runs to the fuel filler neck hose bit that connects to the actual backing of the gas cap....
   
  i have replaced the one behind the gas cap(rubber elbow) so its good but the actual hose is now busted leaking lots of gas....
   
  i thought of buying a stainless steal pipe same size and using the good off the hose on each end to make up for the actual hose ...
  thoughts on this or a link to the hose would be nice..?
   
  i just cant find it if i could i would have replaced it when i replaced the one behind the gas cap....
  rubber elbow thing..
   
  there is a stainless steel pipe that connects from the rubber elbow and then  into the great big fuel hose that connects to the tank...
  i need the great big hose ....
   
  thanks
  peace
  chai
