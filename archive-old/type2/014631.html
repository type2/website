Subject: Torsion Bars and Air Shocks
Message-ID: &lt;27280-3B07FFE6-640_at_storefull-138.iap.bryant.webtv_dot_net&gt;
Content-Disposition: Inline


After unloading the air shocks this morning, down to 25 lbs. ( minimum)
and going for a ride, the right rear is still banging, after going
through a dip or hitting a bump.

What would be a good indication of the torsion bar being broke, other
than the rear end sagging?

The bus is equally low in the rear end, so I can't visually notice any
deviation from side to side. 

I looked at all the rear suspension components, and there doesn't seem
to be anything broken , or out of line.

Let me reiterate, that Clementine rode really flat, level, and nice, for
about 20 minutes, until, she hit the first pot-hole in the road and
that's when the banging started.

Help or suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks,
