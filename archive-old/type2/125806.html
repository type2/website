On Wed, 7 Jul 2004 14:01 , 'M. Cody Rotermund' &lt;crotermund_at_ukiahsolution_dot_com&gt; sent:

&gt;Does anyone have an angle on purchasing a sending unit for my 77's fuel
&gt;tank?  Bus Depot doesn't have any in stock and of course FLAP's don't carry
&gt;that kind of thing.  Is there a good substitute or do I have to get used to
&gt;having my gauge swing from half to empty when I get about a quarter tank
&gt;down?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!
&gt;
