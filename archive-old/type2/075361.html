Subject: Re: [T2] Bus woes

Dan:
Short term, you can probably just back wash the sludge/ rust chips out of the filter by taking the tank side loose adn dumping the gas out while tapping the filter body.
Fill it back up and dump it again.
My 80 Vanagon is doing the same stuff. After 3 cleanings it is now staying clean for much longer intervals.

&gt; Greetings List,
&gt; Here is the situation: Took the Bus (78) to get emissions today and the guy said he couldn't get it to high enough RPM's, it kept &quot;spurting&quot;. He says he thinks the fuel system is dirty and I should change the filter and add a fuel additive to clean it. So I begin to drive it home and it doesn't make it. It starts fine, and idles fine, but when i accelerate it lurches back and forth and sputters as if the fuel supply is being interrupted. Had to park it and walk home.
