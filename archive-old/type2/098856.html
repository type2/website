Brakes are the devices that stop your bus.  &quot;Breaks&quot; are not.

I feel better now...  :)

I just replaced cylinders and shoes today.  Hints I remember:

Whatever you do to one side, you do to the other.

Right away, put the bus on stands and remove the wheels and drums.  Start
hitting the cylinder attach bolt (front and back) with penetrating oil.
do the same for the brake line fitting.  Hit them every few hours from now
until you take them apart.  This will greatly increase your chances of a
problem-free disassembly.

Since you are in there, it is time to change the shoes regardless of
condition.  Since one side is contaminated with brake fluid, it is shot.

Take the drums to a machine shop and have them checked for
size and roundness.  Bus drums are rather thin, so you might end up
replacing them rather than turning them if they aren't up to snuff.

Clean drums clean clean with rubbing alcohol.

Keep the shoes clean.  Use one set of latex gloves for disassembly and
cleaning, another for reassembly.

Buy an 11mm flare nut wrench for the lines.  It's a cross between an open
and box end wrench that makes it a lot easier to loosen the lines.

Make sure that the brake fluid reservoir is topped off before
disassembling, and make sure to check it every few minutes while things
are dripping.  If you let air get into the master cylinder you will have a
much harder time bleeding.

Loosen the emergency brake adjustement all the way.  This will make it
easier to remove the shoes.

You will need replacements for the two small clips that hold the emergency
brake levers to the shoes.

Do one side at a time so you can look at the other side to determine how
things go together.

While the shoes are off, remove the adjusters from the backing plate,
clean the adjusters and their holes, and apply anti-sieze to the inside
and outside of the adjusters.

After reassembling and adjusting, use the bus around town for a few days
before hitting the highway.  Frequently check the drums for excessive
heat.  Bed the brakes gently.

I'll write a more detailed version of my brake saga when it is completely
over.  The complete story is more a &quot;what not to do&quot; tale.
