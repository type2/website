Subject: Re: POR 15 Corrosion Control Process 

I'm just going to start brainstorming about paint-a-bus scenario, and let 
the paint chips fall where they may. Nothing that follows is set in epoxy. 
It is grist for debate, discussion, and revision. I'm trying to get rolling 
on this.....identify some of the parameters for the event. I don't have a 
web site.

Whatever web site that develops will need some basic pages:

We need a TIME WINDOW page to define the event. June is pretty reasonable 
target for this thing. July gets pretty hot, and August is usually very hot.

A Sunday-thru-Saturday week has been mentioned. By June, my bus will be 
ready to hand-sand, wash down, mask, seal, and shoot. It will arrive 
covered with bugs and road tar, and will take half a day to clean up and 
another few hours to mask.

We would probably need to agree on a set of PAINT PRODUCTS that Terry would 
feel comfortable using and which would be available near the event, in 
variety and quantity for whatever this demands. That would help dial in a 
ballpark dollar figure that a participant could be ready to meet.

Do we need a FINANCIAL page?

We could arrive Sunday, get settled and organized, and start working on 
buses on Monday. The following Saturday probably should be set aside for 
closing down the event, cleaning up, packing things away, and getting buses 
in shape for going home.

That leaves Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday for actual team 
accomplishments.....5 days.

One of those days probably will be spent dealing with a tornado or dust 
storm or electrical brown-out-whatever. Nothing ever goes exactly as 
planned. Leave a day for the unexpected to happen.

So we might get in four good work days.  What can __X___number of people do 
in four days, given several sheetmetal nibblers, a welder, rivets, 
grinders, sanders, lots of drills and dremels, and a spray booth with all 
the equipment for spraying. Developing a AVAILABLE TOOL LIST will be helpful.

We will need water, trash barrels, dependable electricity, lots of power 
cords and junction boxes. Looks like a FACILITY page.

Each participant will have to collect his/her panels and body parts and 
rubber seals, etc, and bring them to the party, along with a personal plan 
to get that bus ready to paint by the end of the day Thursday at the 
latest. Then, Friday is the last full day to paint.  Painting can START as 
early as Monday. Terry might want to shoot a few on Saturday, or not. But 
the main painting needs to be done by the end of the day Friday.

Its just a stream of thought. Making it better should be easy.  I usually 
edite and revise anything I care about at least 10 times. Run your finger 
tips over this surface and see how it feels :~)
