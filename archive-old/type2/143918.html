  I just acquired a '77 Deluxe Westfalia and a '79
 Deluxe Westfalia at the same time a few weeks ago.

I am very puzzled that you have a yellow 77 deluxe 
Westy.

The chrome yellow Westy was only offered in the P-22
model in 1977. This is the pop top non-deluxe Westy.
It has yellow/green plaid.

The deluxe Westy was model P-27 and in 1977 was Sage
Green only. It has green plaid.
