Subject: alternator wire identification

I have a 78 westy and I am trying to identify a wire 
coming from the alternator.

There is a bundle of 4 wires that heads to the voltage 
regulator.  Three of the wires go to the regulator, but 
one of them is loose with a connector on the end.  Does 
anyone know what this wire is for?  I thought it was for 
the aux battery relay, but it doesn't seem correct because 
it always has +12v, even when the car is not on.

Any ideas?
Mike
