Subject: Re: [T2] EGR Light/New listee



&gt; Hi all
&gt; I just picked up a 1979 Westy a couple weeks ago and
&gt; need advice on my dash EGR light. How do I switch it
&gt; off ??
&gt; This is an all original 2000FI engine.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance

Be nice to Chuck, baywindow guys!  He was a great help during my recent generator/alternator conversion, pointing me at good sources 
for original VW parts.

As I recall, there is a button on the reverse side of the speedo, or on a box on the speedo cable.  Push the button, and the light goes out 
for another XX,000 miles.  It's just a reminder to maintain the EGR system.
