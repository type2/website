Subject: Re: [T2] My mouse story and a nest.

Last Week I was cleaning out the interior of my 74
westy to make sure I got all of the illegal things
left by the previous owner before I started driving it
on a normal basis. I only found a half a joint under
the back seat. I pulled out the sink cabinet because
there were what looked like mouse droppings under it,
I got it out and there was a mouse hole in the drivers
side wood wall panel. It wasn't a hole that a mouse
made. It looked like it was cut wuth a saw and it
looked like one of those cartoon mousholes off of tom
and jerry or something. Anyways I think someone had a
pet mouse living in the van at some point. The nest
between the wall and the panel was huge. with all of
the little pieces of metal some mouse had like a nice
5 story house. That was a bitch to clean up for sure.
Later,

&gt; I have to add a story.
&gt; 
&gt; A few years ago we were camping in Mobilia in the
&gt; Big Bear mountains 
&gt; of California. Early the next morning we were on a
&gt; narrow and winding 
&gt; highway when a field mouse starts running back and
&gt; forth across the 
&gt; front floor.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know who was more surprised, the mouse or
&gt; us. It was like the 
&gt; mouse was running to and fro over the tops of our
&gt; feet screaming &quot;Oh 
&gt; my God! Oh my God! We were laughing hysterically
&gt; which probably 
&gt; didn't help the mouse's agitation with the
&gt; predicament.
&gt; 
&gt; Feather was driving and she didn't want step on the
&gt; mouse, and lose 
&gt; control, as she tried to pull over into a turn out.
&gt; It was tricky, 
&gt; the road was very winding and there was steep drop
&gt; off to the right 
&gt; (and no guard rails). We got over without driving
&gt; down the cliff and 
&gt; took a moment to figure our next step.
&gt; 
&gt; The mouse finally figured out that the was gap
&gt; between the seat 
&gt; pedestals and headed aft disappearing under the Z
&gt; bed. When we got 
&gt; home I set a catch-em-alive trap and in two days we
&gt; had the mouse 
&gt; alive, we released him in a local canyon.
&gt; 
&gt; I am not sure how the mouse got in the van, the
&gt; doors are hard enough 
&gt; to open for people. It might have climbed up a
&gt; blanket that was 
&gt; hanging out for a while.
&gt; 
&gt; One of those memorable experiences that you cherish.
&gt; 
&gt; When I got the van there was precious little heat
&gt; coming out the 
&gt; vents. I took off the tube underneath the van and
&gt; found a number of 
&gt; toys, pencils, and gunk as well as good size mouse
&gt; nest. Check that 
&gt; tube, after cleaning I got a lot of improved
&gt; heating.
