Subject: Re: [T2] A couple more newb questions. :)

Hi Chris,
      You're in for a treat with the shifting. Reverse is all the way 
over on the left hand side and down--where it belongs (;
      First is far upper left
      Second is down and a little bit of an angle to the right
      Third is all the way over to the right, up and to the left a little
      Fourth is all the way over to the right, and then down and to the 
right a little
      To get into reverse, first go into neutral, and then literally 
push down on the gearshift. It will go down about 3/8ths of an inch, and 
then go all the way over to the left and down.

      Your bus needs a vacuum advance dissy to run correctly.

      All valves are adjusted to .006&quot; with the engine dead cold. This 
is assuming somebody hasn't installed hydraulics. I'm not sure how to 
describe figuring out if you have hydraulics or solids short of removing 
a pushrod tube and looking at the top of the lifter. Perhaps just check 
and see if your vavles already have a little lash in them. If they are 
hydraulics, there should be none. Anybody else want to chime in here?

-John

&gt; Ok, I can't find directions on Valve Adjustments for my 76' 2.0L. Do
&gt; they use Hydralic lifters or whatnot so they don't need adjusting? 
&gt; 
&gt; Secondly, I'm having to buy a Dizzy since my bus didn't come with one. 

&gt; And lastly, here's the REALLY newb one. What order do the gears on the
&gt; tranny go?
