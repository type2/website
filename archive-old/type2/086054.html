Subject:  Taper angle on tie rod ends?


Greetings All,

I was wondering if anyone knew the taper angle
on early (55-67) smaller diameter tie rods ends
and on later (68-79) larger diameter tie rods ends?

I have an application where I want to replace the early tie rod
ends with the later ends and I'm trying to establish the
taper angle I need on a tapered reamer to do so...(to ream out the smaller
'early' tapered hole to take the 'later' larger diameter tie rod end)
 
If I have to have one made I just want to make doubly sure its right!

?????????

regards

RobK
