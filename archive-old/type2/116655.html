Subject: [T2] Cahmpagne edition bus (any owners on the list?)

Vincent ,
I may be mistaken, but I seem to recall that there was an article on the 
Silberfisch 78 in the magazine VW Camper and Commercial a couple of years 
ago. It was a beautiful bus and I think it was from the UK or Germany. I'll 
try to see if I saved that issue when I get home tonight.
