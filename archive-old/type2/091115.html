I wanted to send a muchas gracias to the list for trying to help with my turn signal question the other day...I am the prototypical &quot;trying to learn&quot; person.  I printed off all the suggestions and after hours (literally) trying to fix this problem, most of the time spent looking like a confused dog with his head tilted, I was ready to give up.  It took a kind soul to come and rescue me...in the true spirit of &quot;old VWism&quot;.  Jim came and fixed the problem and even appeared to care about my car being back on the road...anyway, a VERY NICE thing happened due to 'the list' existing...

thanks
