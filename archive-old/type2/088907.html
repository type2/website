Subject: Re: [T2] 2.0 oil drain plug

One thing that you can do is to get yourself a thread pitch guage. Make sure
it is metric for a metric application. Maybe a caliper guage for measuring
inner and outer diameters or thicknesses would be nice also if you have a
little extra cash. If you ever have any question as to whether a screw or
fitting is the right diameter and thread pitch for the job, this should
settle the matter without just trying to gorilla paw the thing and stripping
out threads in the process.
