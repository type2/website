Subject: Re: Air Flow Meter problems...

Jeff,

Yes, that little arm is bent way out of whack. That metal arm is used to
keep the contacts in the lower right quadrant of your picture 'open' when no
air is flowing thru the meter. This cuts current to the fuel pump to keep it
from running if the bus is not running. (This is a safety interlock).
Engaging the starter also forces the pump to run - thus bypassing the
contacts in the AFM.

This bent arm should not cause a problem with your AFM - it will just keep
your fuel pump running whenever your ignition is on.

Who was the Neanderthal that did this to your poor little AFM?

Good Luck,

Ed
'77 Westy

&gt;&gt;Hello list-
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I'm in need of a photo of the top inside of an air flow meter.. mine's out
&gt;&gt;of a '76 Westy. Daisy's been in the hands of strangers for the last 2
months
&gt;&gt;and someone screwed with the airflow meter and bent up some of the
contacts
&gt;&gt;and &quot;whatnot&quot; inside.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;She runs with the air flow meter disconnected, but will not run with it
&gt;&gt;connected. I've put a picture up on my website with a circle around the
part
&gt;&gt;in question... I think it's bent but I have nothing to compare it to..
