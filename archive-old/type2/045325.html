 &gt;I want to do a ground up restoration but don't know where to start.

...........I know you aren't a dummy, Steve. Wherever you start, take 
photos and keep detailed records of what attaches to what and how, and use 
tags on the ends of wires and hoses, so you can match them up again in 6 
months, after your short term memory has been flashed. I hope everyone 
believes that restoration is a proper topic for the type2 list. I apologize 
in advance to those that disagree, but surely we all face restoration in 
our ownership of these buses. I think I recall a FAQ on this topic at the 
type2 website.

I negotiate major panel work with a professional body shop that is 
interested in working with me. It took months to locate the right one. 
Avoid shops that are focused on late model crash repairs and high volume 
insurance work.

Then, I do the small stuff myself if it doesn't involve a rust-through from 
the inside. But I gladly pay the professionals for cutting, welding, 
brazing and filling and finishing. I take it apart and bring it to them 
ready for the bench.

When fixing small surface rust spots and chipped spots myself, I plan to 
take several days for each work cycle. I might spend months doing 2-3 hour 
sessions as follows:
I take the car into a warm dry garage, clean it up, and use the Dremel to
surgically remove the rust down to bare metal. It takes about ten minutes.
This creates a depression in the metal surface. Then I put a thin film of
phosphoric acid on the bare metal and let it dry. A hairdryer speeds this
up. There goes another ten minutes. Then I mix about twice as much epoxy 
(SUPERMEND)as
I think I'll need, and I mix it two or three times as long as the
directions say, using left-over popsicle sticks. The trick is to get
exactly 50-50 amounts of resin and hardener, and mix it down to a molecular
level. Then when it sets up, it is hard as steel and glossy. Mixing takes
about 5 minutes.

Then I dab the prepared spot with enough of the epoxy mix (SUPERMEND) to 
bring the
surface up level with the surrounding surfaces..._dot_usually using a small
disposable watercolor brush, a wooden toothpick, and some paper towels for
the hands and to wipe off any accidental/excess dabbing. It sets up
overnight and is able to take outside the next day. And you can wait until
summer to smooth it off, prime it, and paint it. For a day, I keep any 
extra mixed
epoxy on a card, near the actual repair, and test the epoxy on the card to
see how the repair is actually setting up. If the card doesn't set up to my 
satisfaction, I remove the epoxy from the repair and do it over until I get 
it right.

As mentioned above, the epoxy I use for the repairs is a product call 
SUPERMEND, sold at local ACE hardware store. Yellow and white box with red 
lettering. About $5-7 I think. One box lasts 4
months around my house and we fix anything that breaks..._dot_cars, boats,
chairs, other toys, drawers, broken knobs, etc.  SUPERMEND is able to set
up under water, and is waterproof when hardened. Don't use an epoxy that
isn't waterproof. It will soften and have to be replaced.

I used this method to fix about 25 rust spots and stone chips on my  76 VW 
Westfalia, which isn't done yet.

Whole process of Dremeling and mixing and applying takes about half an hour 
to 45
minutes, and you are at least half way done with a permanent repair that
can be delayed indefinitely....years if necessary, to arrive at the step 
where you sand it flat and prime it and paint it..

And the white epoxy polka dots are very interesting, especially on a red car.

 &gt;Does anyone know of a Car Restoration for Dummies type book or any book
 &gt;that would be helpful to the novice.

 &gt;BTW I already have the hayes, chiltons, bently and keep to vw alive books.
