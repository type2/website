Subject: Re: Insulation!

Hi,

While replacing the bulb in the overhead interior light, I noticed some
insulation that looked like typical insulation but it was loose. It was
fluffy yellow stuff. Is this supposed to be there? My impression that this
would act like a sponge and promote rust like others have mentioned. I was
wondering if this was stock insulation? Maybe the PO did this?

Thanks,
Jen
