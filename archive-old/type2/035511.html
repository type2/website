Subject: Clutch adjustment and maintenance Re: clutch update

Zac hit der nail mit der hammer on this one. I will add, at every
maintenance inspection, the adjustment should be checked and the slack kept
at optimum, right after every time cleaning the threads to the degree
necessary for free running adjustment, wherein holding of the cable with
vice grips is no longer necessary as the tension of the clean threads is
overcome with less than half a twist of the cable and corrects it's self
upon first actuation (disengagement of the clutch disc by engaging the
pedal to the floor then re-engaging the clutch by disengagement of the
pedal. I must admit I suffered somewhat many years ago before I got this
concept down pat).

When the clutch is engaged (pedal up) the correct gap between the throwout
bearing and the fingers on the pressure plate is but a few 10th's of a mm.
The return spring wrapped around the cross shaft lever pulls the throw out
bearing back away from the clutch fingers the adjusted amount.

Lying on your right side mit der head not quite kerbumppin on the left
drive axle mit der feet pointing forward, reach up mit der left hand and
grasp the lever firmly mit der fingers behind das vingnut and der thumb
against the opposite side at the shaft center. Pull firmly against the
return spring. The end of the lever should move but a millimeter or so as
you release and pull several times to feel the adjustment.

To do this comfortably you must judge the height to set the jack stands for
the length of der arm. Us apes of the 32&quot; arm persuasion can in most cases
just squeeze under a stock height Bus to make the adjustment by feel and
not need the eye/light tech, but only if it is a maintained thread, ie,
clean and lubed.

The first time I see any particular Bus, I clean and lube this thread as
required, so in future, I can make the adjustment by quickly wiping it
clean of sleight contamination, dab a bit of grease on the junction, feel
the play, give der vingnut a half a turn or more as required, note the
number of turns required, and be in and out in two or three minutes therein
showing the value of taking the time the first time to clean and lube the
threads that had no maintenance since the last cable was replaced and who
knows how long ago as this was not noted, ie no data. Also, note the value
of having taken 5 or ten seconds to note actual data so the adjustment
process can be reviewed over the life of the components, so before you
reach the end of the thread due to a combination of clutch disc wear and
cable stretch, the suspect components can be replaced at the next
inspection prior to failure on the way to San Bozo.

Consider also, many many other threads on the vehicle need periodic
maintenance at a frequency somewhere this side of never. Torn backing
plates from seized brake shoe adjusters costs the same to fix right whether
from ignorance, negligence or incompetance.
