I have yet to see a reference to &quot;bench bleeding&quot; in a VW manual.  The
problem with bench bleeding is that you cannot get the MC into the vehicle
without spoiling that great bleeding job that you have done.  If the
brakes do not bleed properly, something is wrong and resorting to exotic
procedures will just prolong the agony.

Do you have disks?  Did you miss a bleeder on the proportioning valve?
