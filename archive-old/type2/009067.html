sounds about right!

It happened to me in a big rain storm.  I drove to work and set the 
parking brake (on a flat surface, duh) in the parking lot.  4 hours
later, she no go! &lt;G&gt;  The rear pads rusted to the drum. :(

Mark

&gt; Sounds like your rear drums were stuck.  It's happened to me more than once
&gt; and I usually fix it just the way you did.  It seems to occur when you set
&gt; the parking brake after driving in the rain.  So now, I don't set the
&gt; parking brake after I've been driving in the rain.  :)
