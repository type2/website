Thom says:

&gt;Buy a &quot;new bus&quot; and what do you get?  The privelege of being the first
&gt;on the block for maybe a month, then 5 years of payments.  After 5 years
&gt;what do you have?  Just another $2500 car.

Uh reality.

One would be hard pressed to buy a '93 EV for $2500 today.  Frankly mom
and dad just bought the 2000, and hard as I find to admit it, I like the
thing.
To boot it was heavily discounted, went for about $5k under the $33,500
sticker
and is certainly nicer than anything else on the market if you hate cupholders
and like 747 cockpit illumination.  Of course they had the luxury of paying
cash out the door.

Of course I'd take a double cab Vanagon in a second as well.

Now I agree with Thom that you wouldn't catch me dead in that concept
beetle F's a diesel locomotive thingy.  What the hell are they going after
with that nose.  If they'd just place the engine where it needs to be and
all.  Course I wouldn't drive a waterbug either for that matter.  But I bet it
would sell, just like the waterbug to the wanna be hippie world.
