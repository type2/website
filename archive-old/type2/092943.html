Subject: Re: [T2] Calling all carbd 2.0s

Visit your FLAPS and look at the specs on a mid-eighties Japanese carb'ed car.

Can't remember which one but there was a cheap electric pump good for a 
carb application. The part counter catalog will list the specs.

Probably cheaper than CB Performance. I've noticed that alot of their stuff 
is off the shelf stuff that they are selling as specialized parts. For 
example their fuel injection system uses GM parts with the part#s removed 
with a simple controller. You wouldn't know necessarily which replacement 
parts you need and you would have to go back to CB Performance. Obviously 
with the parts numbers you could get replacements locally.
