i agree, a showpiece car is nice to look at, but i
tend to like the advice my uncle gave me once.   

&quot;its just no fun to own it if you don't put itsideways
once in a while.&quot;

he was speaking more on the sports car side so just
insert, camp, take a trip in etc., and you get
mydrift.  have a great wekend!
