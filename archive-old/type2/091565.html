Subject: Two questions ..............

Today I found four thin shims stacked under the distributor lock down
holder.
I can't figure out the purpose of the shims.
The little spring is in the drive and this stack of shims looks like it
accomplishes nothing.
Any word from the 009 guru?  Type I engine gury?
------------------------------
I'm down to getting the horn working to get my 66 van inspected.
I've replaced the bad horn with a good horn and was just wondering about
the most common problems, hoping for a shorted day tomorrow.
