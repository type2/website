Sensible recs, I usually scrape the heavy and then bead blast the top
with the sides masked.  A scotch bright to clean up the sides and a
quick polish of the tops to finish it all off and look good, but as usual
being the devil's advocate just like with my gas tank rec I'll ask.

WHY WOULD YOU?

If there is that much carbon, the pistons probably should be heading
for the trash bin.  I'd also take this time to mention that on a certain
auction site I know and love and have never had bad luck with a set
of 2.0 P&amp;C's went last weekend for $115.  There is a set at about $130
now.  I have nothing to do with either of the sellers, I just like to buy
my T4 parts reasonable.  I will and have re-used T4 pistons and jugs,
certainly safer most times than on a T1, sometimes I hone em on a
lathe with 120 grit enough to restore a good seating surface and rering
other times I just pull em in the jugs and don't disturb anything.  But
if you pull out a good set of bore mics, the jugs usually don't strictly
make it on roundness, and often at least one skirt is collapsed on
the pistons.  New is cheap if you look, and full service life.  If you only
want to get another 30-50k out of this mill, say are only touching up
the heads with a cheapy guide replacement and quick grind, etc go
for it.  Also ask why so much carbon is it heavy oily stuff from ring
blowby or is it thick powdery stuff from rich running, either way, do
something appropriate.

YMMV as usual.
