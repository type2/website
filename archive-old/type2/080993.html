Subject: Fitting

Evening, all. After having no luck in the archives I turn to the list for
information. I have a
74/T4-1800/manual. On the left side of the fan housing near the top is a
tubular fitting sticking out about 3/4&quot;. It points to the left, is smooth
and maybe 5/8 diameter. Any idea what this is? Where it goes, what it does?

Any info is appreciated.
