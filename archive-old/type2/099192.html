&gt;They will work on type4 engine tin, but they are a

I have often looked at these seals and thought that they should be on my 
type4, but have never wanted to shell out the cash for the experiment. 
Has anybody ever tried taking the seals off these plug boots and putting 
them on a standard set of type4 wires? That is what I thought I would try.
