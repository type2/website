Subject: Re: [T2] RE:sink top

I do still have the sink top. I am not sure if my info was very accurate or
not. I hope it will work for you, but what I have is a little hinged top
(only) that folds over the sink. It will fold back between the jump seat and
fridge. It looks like this folded:

and like this unfolded:

If you need it let me know. If not hopefully somebody else can use it. It is
in good condition, and its free to someone who truly needs it.

&gt; Hi Ron, I have been looking for a sink top for my '69 Westy for a while
&gt; now. Mine is made of a whitish, formica-like molded material. It is the
&gt; original sinktop, but is badly deteriorated on surfaces exposed to sun. If
&gt; you have a sinktop you are looking to part with, I would be very
interested
&gt; in it if it would fit my van. Please let me know if you still have. I am
&gt; located in central NC. Thanks. Jon. '62 '67 '69

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hey
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks to eveyone who graciously offered me a net. I have decided to
&gt; accept
&gt; &gt; Karl von Salzen's offer for one for cheap. He has given me 2 other
things
&gt; &gt; for free and I am truly awed by him.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In an effort to keep the good karma going I am offering a sink top for
the
&gt; &gt; 68-71 Westy I believe. It is the one with the graph pattern on it. It is
&gt; &gt; very nice and clean. I am going to give it away but please only take it
if
&gt; &gt; you really need it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I apreciate it!
