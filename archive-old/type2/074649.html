Subject: Looking for #'s???

Hello all, I'm looking for the correct distributor for my type 4 1700 
engine. I've been searching the net, cruising the archives, and I'm 
desperately trying to get rid of the 009 I currently have. I've referenced 
the #'s on the Old Volks Ignition page to get the correct dizzy numbers I 
need. The problem now is I can't seem to find anything on the net or through 
my parts people the distributor for the bus. The number is:

  From Bosch-    0231 181 005
or the VW #-    021 905 205n

  All the part companies seem to have the 009 and the 050 for sale. Am I 
stuck with choosing from only these two? Ideally, I've been informed, I 
need/should get a vacume AND a centrifugal advance distributor. Does anyone 
have any ideas or suggestions? Any info would be great!
  Also, just in case it does matter, I have dual 34 ICT Webs on as well.

  Thanks,

  Carl

                  Ask for no security, ask for no guarantees,
                  there never was such an animal. And even if
                  there was it would be related to the great sloth
                  which hangs upside down all day, every day, wasting
                  its life away. To hell with that. Shake the
                  tree and knock the sloth down on his ass.
