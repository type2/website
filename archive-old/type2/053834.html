&gt; I'm not an electrical engineer (that was my major 25 years ago but realized
&gt; I hated math.) I have always been fascinated by electricity (my dad is a ham
&gt; like Mr Lyle, and I grew up around electrical gadgets)
&gt; 
&gt; Wouldn't using 4 or 5 16 gage wires, unless stripped and wrapped together,
&gt; have 4 or 5 times the resistance?  Even though the current would be the
&gt; same, each of the small wires would probably get pretty hot.

IF the wires are in parallel, they would each take 1/5 of the current
whether they are separate or wrapped together.  Now if you put them
end-to-end (in series) they would get quite toasty!
