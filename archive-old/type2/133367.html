&gt; What I have seen from many years of working on these busses is the driving
&gt; habits of people will also play a large roll in how long the engines will
&gt; last.  The most important gauge a person can have in their air cooled
&gt; vehicle is a tach.  You should limit as much as possible not driving your
&gt; vehicle below 2,800 RPM or above 3,800 RPM.  Do not &quot;lug&quot; the vehicle around
&gt; town or on hills, shift down.

one of the few advantages of the auto tranny, it is next to impossible to
overrev or lug the engine if you are adjusted right and stay reasonably
close to the (Eastern) speed limits
