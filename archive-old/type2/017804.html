&gt; My parking brake would frequently stick, but I usually could get it going
&gt; by putting the bus in gear and using force to get it to pop loose.
&gt; However, one day, it wouldn't come loose no matter what I did.  One wheel
&gt; was free, but the other would actually slide across the driveway.  I
&gt; stopped before I did any permanent damage and called my mechanic.
&gt; 
&gt; He said that the brake cable will often freeze up.  He suggested cutting
&gt; the cables near the brake (don't confuse the parking brake cable with the
&gt; main brake hydraulic line!), releasing the parking brake, and driving it to
&gt; the shop so he could put new cables in.  So, I cut the cable, but the
&gt; brakes were still locked!
&gt; 
&gt; I finally had it towed to the shop where he said it took quite some effort
&gt; to free the brakes.  He said that this was fairly common on busses and
&gt; suggested not using the parking brake all the time.  He said to save it for
&gt; parking on hills.  So, now I just park the bus in gear without the brake.

I'd recommend just the opposite: use the parking brakes often, to
prevent rust from accumulating in the cables. I replaced the cables on
my 69 double cab in 86 or 87, they still work perfectly. It has sat in
the garage the last few winters, however. That's what's death on them-
SALT!
