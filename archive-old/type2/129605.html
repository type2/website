Subject: RE: [T2] Oil Cooler help

About the same. I chamged my oil every 3000 miles and all is well. I prefer synthetic now for resistance to heat. I also used it in my aircooled Honda motorcycle. 

Problem with elaborate cooler arrangements (my Beetle has one with double coolers and fan and thermostat b/c the 911 style fan doesn't have provisions for a stock cooler in the stock location) is that it becomes difficult to properly drain the system during an oil change. Also slower warm ups, more opportunities for leaks and if your engine develops a low oil pressure condition like mine had (loose main bearings) it may (and I don't know for sure) have trouble circulating that oil properly. 

Lastly it may require more horsepower to push all that oil around. I'd like to know that answer for a fact though. 

When I installed my Corvair this past Christmas, I spun the oil pump with a drill to circulate the oil before I started it the first time. The was a significant drag on the drill once oil pressure came up. I was using a 1/2&quot; Milwaukee drill and it really put a drag on the drill. Would it be more for a larger (longer) system? I dunno. 

I'd chase all the other options still before I went with an external cooler.
