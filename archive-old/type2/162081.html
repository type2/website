&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; I'm getting to work on a 74 with a supposedly just rebuilt engine from a
&gt; 78.  

Steve,,, if you step on the clutch,, with the vehicle in gear... and push 
the vehicle along... then you know the trans nor the rear axle is seized... 

if you can spin the engine on the floor but not in the vehicle.. 

Then I think Karl hit it... sounds like a 228mm flywheel &lt;from the 78&gt; is 
hitting the inside of the bellhousing that accepts the 215mm or 210mm 
flywheel.. &lt;from the 74&gt; 

unfortunatly you probably have to take the engine out again to check....  
unless you know how to identify the 228mm flywheel... and you can look thru 
the starter hole to see.... you can tell real easy if there is a 228mm 
flywheel in the 002 bellhousing. 

maybe someone can post a picture of the ring gear of the 228 vs the 215mm
and a pic of the starter housing for the 091 bellhousing vs the 002 


Hope that helps
