Subject: Re: [T2] RE: [VB] BEWARE... crank gears

Hi Craig,

    About a hundred years ago at the dealer, we had an old slow cooker in
the &quot;unit room&quot; with oil in it, set on high. We just left it on all the time
(which I would never do at our shop), when we took a crank apart we just
dropped the gears in the oil, and they were ready to go when we were.
    At one time I tried an old coffee maker (again stolen from wife), just
didn't get hot enough. Now I have an old electric Hot Plate on the bench. I
have found that high temp will heat the cam drive gear to 600 f (using my
infrared temp gun), and medium will get the distributor drive to about 250
f. Both will slide on without having to be driven with a hammer. I stole an
old pair of hot dog tongs from the wife. I heat the ends of the tongs
slightly, so there not a heat sink. I also worked the ends with a hammer a
little so the curved ends fit the gears just right. Now they also hold the
gears firm enough to twist them around so I can line up with the key and
push them on before they cool down.
    Works for me, good luck.
