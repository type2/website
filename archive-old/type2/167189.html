Subject: RE: [T2] Who makes the best front rotors for '72 bus? And think
  I can do  it myself?

I know when shopping for rotors for my VW Corrado that Zimmerman are very good
quality.

Are yours warped? Sometimes old rotors can be machined if enough is left on
them.

Yea rotors and pads are a straightforward job. Sometimes though stuff can be
rusted and stuck or whatnot and that can be what makes it harder on an old bus
as compared to newer brakes. There is a special tool to hold the pads in place
thats helpful, I got one for cheap from Harbor Freight.

And think I can do it myself?&gt; &gt; Hello all, getting the 72 Westy in shape for
summer,&gt; and I'm topped out at the mechanic with CV joints and&gt; rear brakes.&gt;
&gt; Turns out, I'll need front rotors and pads with a few&gt; hundred miles. and
thought I can save a couple hundred&gt; bucks by doing it myself. I've been
looking for parts&gt; online and BusDepot has some rotors by Zimmerman.&gt; Anyone
have experience with these? &gt; &gt; Also, I have the factory blue manual, plus the
Haynes,&gt; and the Muir books and consider myself pretty handy.&gt; Do you think
rotors/pads is a job do-able at home? &gt; &gt; Thanks&gt; J.&gt; &gt;
