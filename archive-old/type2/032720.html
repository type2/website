They are very tight.

&gt; You _shouldn't_ be able to put the wire in place over the cover
&gt;without a small lever.  If you can do it by hand, rebend/replace the
&gt;bails.

I use a screwdriver.

&gt;Fel-Pro makes very nice neoprene gaskets.  Ask your FLAPS.

Tried them, they leaked as bad as or worse than the cork ones.

&gt;Be sure that the gasket matches the cover.  some covers have a
&gt;projection on the narrow side that interferes with the wide part of
&gt;some gaskets.  Trim the gasket to fit.

I checked, double-checked, and triple-checked that the gaskets were
straight and nothing was interfering.  Tried the cover both orientations.

&gt;Gasket glue on the cover side.  Permatex blue (and nothing else!) on
&gt;the head side.

I just used Permatex blue on both sides and it stopped the leak.  I have
resigned myself to simply replacing the gaskets every time I have the
covers off, which fortunately isn't more than once a year.  Sometimes less.
I realize that there *has* to be something that was causing it to leak, but
I have grown weary of spending money and time to find the problem,
especially now that I do not have a driveway to work in.

Thanks for the ideas,

-David
