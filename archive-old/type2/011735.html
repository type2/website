Subject:  re:straightening bumpers

FWIW

I had the rear bumper on the 70 Westy along with the the front 3 piece
bumper and the four bumper attachments straightened and media blasted 
for the grand price of $215.00.  I never shopped around.  Had it done at 
a local chrome plate shop that dealt a lot with bumpers.  The rear 
was not a pretty sight and damned if they didn't get that as straight as
an arrow.  I did notice 'a lot' of 1.5&quot; narrow punch marks on the interior sides, plus heatmarks in the really bad areas.

ps. for another $250. they would have chromed the bumpers.  I rattle 
canned them white.
