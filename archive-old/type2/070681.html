Subject: Rough Running Fuel Injection
X-SLUIDL: 76588570-716C11D5-9A3400A0-C90689DF

Hey All,

I've been having intermittent problems with my fuel injection for 
about a year.  I store the bus in the winter so I didn't worry about 
it until recently when I pulled it out of storage.  Here are the 
details:
1978 Westy with a rebuilt 2.0 from Boston Engine.
When the bus is working properly, it runs fine, good power, nice and 
smooth.  But occasionally it will just cut out to idle, if I try to 
give it gas it just spews black smoke and runs really rough.  I have 
a replaceable marine fuel filter with a clear bowl, and there is no 
water or dirt in it.  I just replaced the filter, thinking it was 
clogged and that was the problem, but it wasn't.  I  removed my tank 
a few years ago and repaired it, so I don't think that is the 
problem.  I have a new &quot;used&quot; afm unit on there when my original one 
failed, and this is the second one. The bus will idle fine whether 
this problem is happening or not.  In an attempt to find the problem, 
I noticed the cap to the electrical in the AFM box was loose, so I 
looked in and watched as I revved it.  Cleaned the contacts, but no 
help.  I then tapped on a couple of things and tried again and it 
started working fine.  I have no idea what I may have done, if 
anything, to make it work.    Sometimes it will have this problem for 
an hour, sometimes just for a second as I am driving.  I really don't 
want to replace the AFM unit again if I don't have to.

For now I have taken to reciting Ohm's law to it and waving a 
screwdriver at it menacingly. I don't know how much longer that will 
work though, I think she is getting wise to me....

Any ideas?
