&gt; Not necessarily a crazy thought... If you're like me, you wish you had
&gt; a nice old bug or ghia convertible, and maybe a 21 window sunroof

&gt; will be a little while before I can save enough for even one such
&gt; model (in nice shape, of course) and in the meantime prices continue
&gt; to climb.
&gt;
&gt; So... I thought that maybe a few of us would be willing to get
&gt; together, pitch in, say, $1-2,000 and buy one or two old VWs to SHARE.
&gt; I *know* that these things are not always easy to implement and that
&gt; they can be a source of conflict; rules of rotation, maintenance, etc.
&gt; would have to be worked out and agreed on beforehand, but I believe
&gt; it's feasible. Most listmembers I've had the chance to meet, I would
&gt; trust implicitly.
&gt;
Ooh, count me in! I always find busses/Bugs/Ghias that I'd love to rescue for
myself, but I can't afford to have that many vehicles. I myself love fixing
them up, and would really love to have folks to share the financial backing, as
well as the enjoyment. The more cars you have, the harder it is to give them
equal driving/enjoying time.
 Although I am really idealistic and trusting, I realize there could be some
problems. However, I agree that in general we busvolk seem to be more
trustworthy than in general. So, count me in here on the east coast. If someone
else has the finances and space, I have leads on some nice old bugs and ghias
right now, and would happily work on them.
Let's do it!
Air Cooled Search &amp; Rescue Team will save the day!
