Hey all, I have a very annoying and reoccurring problem in my stick 78
standard. Every time I shift (mostley in 3rd and 4th) the car would start
jerking back and fourth uncontrolably, until I put it in neutral..... When
this problem doesn't happen, It would usually shift fine, but when I pik up
speed she starts doing it again. I think it's  the clutch, the Trans. or both.
but since I lack the experience on how these beauties run, I have no clue as
how to find out exactly whats wrong.. I checked the archives and looked
through books, but nothing seems to help. Please help me

Thanks for your time
-Aaron
