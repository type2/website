Subject: ISO reputable mechanic on MS Gulf Coast
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

The subject line pretty much says it all.....

I have a '77 9 seater that needs engine work and a '79 that needs the
engine looked at among other things (It was allowed to burn by the PO!)

I haven't found a REPUTABLE mechanic since I moved here almost 2 years
ago....  If anyone knows someone... let me know!
