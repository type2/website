Subject: Re: [T2] Propane heater

I had a small heater like that cause a fire under a 
bus one time in a small garage . 

Yeah - I have serious fears about fire. Have had several small incidents get my attention over the years usually related to stupidity or beer! &lt;grin&gt; 

Caught my sleeve on fire once. Had been cleaning parts with gasoline outside away from the house. Later went to start the burn barrel. My sleeve was dry but had fumes in it(?). Lit right up. No injury. 

Had friend with a dead BMW (this was in Italy). I was cranking it when before I could stop him he poured a big gulp of gasoline into the carb. The engine sputtered and lit the gas on top of the carb, the engine, the jug of gas, him, and once he dropped it, the ground around the front of the car. Oh, and the car was gridlocked parked so several other cars had fire under them.  I ran for an extinguisher and realized I had forgotten the Italian word for &quot;fire&quot;. No damage but alot of soot and some blisters on my friend. LOTS of adrenaline... I chose to keep quiet but my friend had to share with the world how &quot;dumb&quot; he had been so I was recommended and recieved the Navy Achievement Medal. I was so embarrassed about it that I did not even show up to recieve it. That got me in trouble!!! &lt;grin&gt; 

No flames for me around anything flammable....
