Cox Motors
258 Wilmington Hwy, Jacksonville, NC 28540
Phone: (910) 347-4874

You can pull parts yourself. Very reasonable prices. Very nice people

I think that we should try to keep this place stocked also. If you know
of any parts busses or aircooled VWs that are wasting away in Eastern
NC, let Cox Motors know of them.

I don't have the land or desire to stockpile busses, but I'm glad
someone still does. Without them, we would be SOL.

Steve
