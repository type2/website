Subject: Re: [T2] bad fuel filter reactions 

&gt; bucking really bad now so couldnt of been the fuel filter... bucks real bad in third and fourth..... also
trying to cut off at the red lights after idleing down...? it sounds normal and then just acts to want to
die....?
 rev a little to stayed crunk.. when idleing... it sounds as if it misses a heart beat in its rythym a skip if
that makes sense..? sounds like after a few repetitions..? leaking oil pretty bad and maybe using it?

If you have a fuel injected bus engine......
This is the classic symtom of a loose or bad #3 cylinder head temp sensor.

But I am just guessing here because I do not have a clue as to your bus year or engine or fuel system:)
