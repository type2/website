Subject: Re: [T2] Wheel color and Champagne Editions

The wheels on my CE Westy were the same as the upper color of the body -
Pastel White.  I had them repainted at the same time as the body.

&gt; Sorry guys, another difference between regular and Champagne edition

&gt; silver.._dot_can't quite decide.
