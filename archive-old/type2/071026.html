In an effort to escape the landlords forgot to disconnect my axles until the 
2nd morning of voyage. 78
091 transmission; condition - damaged. Won't stay still
when parked in gear. Gears feel loose. Am I cooked? Can I drive it or should 
I tear it out and look to rerebuild? Any advice appreciated. Don't know how 
bad it is damaged from this but need to get iit off the street soon. CC my 
e-mail is possible. Happy holidays. -Chris
