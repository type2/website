Jeff,

Since your garage is tight enough to consider heating it, it is tight
enough to put in a fogger and to cure the yellow jacket problem
permanently (or at least till spring :-)  Open the bus up as much as you
can (doors, hatches, cabinets) then put one fogger in front of the bus and  
another behind and off to one side.  

Random Thoughts:

I would not put one under the bus nor would I put one under the open rear
hatch.  They do spray up ~6-8 feet, so you can get staining if there is
anything above them at a lower height.  

I don't know if it would be better to have the heat going or not... I
would tend to heat so the beechos were active, but there is a slight fire
danger.  

Having a fan on to circulate the vapors would probably be a good idea.

I would *not* be present!  Do it just before you go to bed and re-enter
after work the next day.
