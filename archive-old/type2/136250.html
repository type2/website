Subject: I finally fixed something!!!!

So I decided that I couldn't spend any more money on
fixing my bus, so I sat down and finally read the
idiots guide myself.  The problem ended up being that
the spark plug wasn't fully plugged in (DUH!).  Just
goes to show what you can do when you actually try.  Haha.
