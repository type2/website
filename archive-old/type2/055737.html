&gt;I am not bitching about the bandwidth. There are slivers I would like to
&gt;see shaved but by and large our bandwidth use is very intelligent, for a
&gt;recreational list it is surprising, for an automotive list it really is
&gt;astonishing. &gt;
&gt;Meanwhile just, please, think before you speak, I don't have a problem with
&gt;any particular thread but don't post two messages if you could post one and
&gt;don't post &quot;two cents' worth&quot;, post a dollar instead.


Here are two methods I use to help save the endangered spotted (or
herbaceous) bandwidth.
When tempted to respond to a post, I first consider if the reply is of
interest to the general list, if not, I will p-mail the poster. Second, I
sort my messages by subject, and read the responses already posted. If
somebody else has covered the material, there is no need to &quot;me too&quot;. These
are simple steps, and perhaps obvious, but they can cut the volume
substantially.
My $1.00 worth.
