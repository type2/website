Subject: FIRE! 

Mi'Ladies, Gentlesirs, (and the rest of you too)

I feel sorry for Bill, but this is the third serious fire we have had on
this list, which is way too many, given that we are *supposed* to be a
group of moderately intelligent people.  Sorry if this post ticks people
off but I hope it (and Bill's experience) finally pushes the last holdouts
into going out and spending the $30.00 on a decent ABC fire extiguisher.

Please, please, PULEEZE next time you go out to your bus, lean over and
grab the fire extinguisher, pick it up and check that it is within spec.

If you cannot reach it because it isn't there, FOR GOODNESS SAKE GO GET
ONE!!!!!!!!!  How many &quot;my bus burned&quot; posts must we have before we
finally get to a &quot;my bus caught fire, but I put it out with minimal damage
because I reached down and grabbed the extinguisher&quot;?

If you cannot reach the extinguisher from the drivers seat, move it
somewhere where you can. Mine is under the passenger seat in the long
compartment.  Behind your left ear or mounted between the seats are also
good.  Under the rear bench or in the tool box are not.  Seconds *count*,
honest.

Aircooled busses are not a disposable commodity.  Like land, they ain't
making any more of them. It's you bus and, to a certain extent, yours to
do with as you will, but we are also the &quot;keepers of the flame&quot; on another
level.  Because we maintain, because we restore, because we care, and
because, as members of the list, we support each other in these efforts,
our busses are far more likely to survive. Take a look next friday at
Joel's list of busses.  Notice all those goose eggs back in the early
years?  In five years will your bus still be on that list?  parted out?
Crushed?  In ten years?  In thirty?  How long 'til there is a goose egg
next to one of the breadloaf years?  How long before the last split goes
into a collection?
