&lt;&lt;     After living in my westy for a month now, I'm getting a bit tired
of having to buy ice all the time. Will the electric/propane fridges
from the later westies fit a '73 easily? Other than the obvious
electrical &amp; gas connections? Do they work on 110v as well? Anyone got
one for sale?&gt;&gt;

It depends on what you have in your '73 now.  Do you have the deluxe camper
with all the cabinets?  You could find an entire interior from a newer bus
that has the propane, 12v/110v frig, and cut a hole in the side of your bus to
install the flue, this would require you to rip out any cabinets you have now.

If I wanted to add a propane fridge on my '74, I would need to vent it out
through the floor since the frig cabinet does not back up to an outside wall.
I asked someone at Dometic about this recently, and they said there should be
no problem venting one of their propane units out through the floor.  I don't
know if you need any special fittings, or connectors, but It may be possible.

Of course it has been done, since I've seen pictures of a '74 Westy with a
propane frig.  I would guess that it intakes and exhausts through the floor,
but I may be wrong.  Any European listees want to jump in on this one?
