Subject: Driving in the snow.

I have a 1979 Sage Green Westphalia that I purchased in 1992 in Texas
and have stored in a Massachusetts garage for the last six winter
seasons.  I have moved to another house in Boston and no longer have
access to a garage so I thought maybe this year I will have to drive my
Westy in the snow.  Is there anything that I should know about driving
in the snow?  Special tires? etc...

Thanks,

Ed Fierros
