Subject: Hello, I'm new!
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hello everyone!   Just dropping a line to introduce myself, and to say
hello.  I'm new to the bus world, just having recently fallen in love with
the functionality of the VW Westfalia, and am going to buy a bus in the
next couple of months.   I have an opportunity to check out a bus this
evening, a '69 Westie (price of $900).   Since I really don't know much
about years/makes/models and their various qualities, I thought I would
first ask the general question:  &quot;What do you think of the '69?&quot;   Also,
the guy said that there is some rust both on the doors of the bus extending
down to the rocker panels underneath.  I think the rust has eaten through
the body.   Any ideas of prices to replace the rocker panels on a '69, or
links where I could find parts prices?

I also had the idea of taking some pictures of this bus and posting them to
a web page to solicit comments about any potential problems that might be
visable.   I told the seller that I would like a week to think it over
after seeing the bus, so I have the time. 

Anyway, if you want to say hi, or have any thoughts about the above, feel
free to drop me a line in private.    Thanks so much for providing a great
resource.  I'm looking forward to being a type 2 owner!!!!!
