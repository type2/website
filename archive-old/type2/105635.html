Subject: Re: [T2] Turn Signal Relay Nightmare.... I'm desperate.

&gt;I cannot get my turn signals or emergency flashers to work.  I 
&gt;followed the Bentley manual to the letter.
&gt;
&gt;Here is what I have tried:
&gt;1.  After following the steps in the Bentley manual, it seemed 
&gt;that the emergency relay was bad.  So, I was able to get two from 
&gt;a junk yard.  I tested them both and they both are good.  I 
&gt;connected one of them and nothing worked, tried the second one 
&gt;and nothing worked.

It's been a long time since I've messed with any wiring in my bus (aren't I
the lucky one), but if memory serves, the emergency switch itself is the
likely suspect.  When my turn signals and emergency flashers quit I replaced
the emergency flasher pull-switch and fixed the problem.
