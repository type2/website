Subject: Re: [T2] New Bus owner need help identifying part

From Zach Drew:

I understand that holes in this part could cause the engine to run
lean(thanks Karl).  That being said Karl also stated that it could cause a
vacuum leak as well.  If I am not mistaken the brake servo operates off
the vaccuum system does it not?  If my brake servo doesn't work, couldn't
this be part of the problem?  

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

No, your power brakes work off manifold vacuum. 

The EGR filter will not affect booster vacuum. 

Booster vacuum is line A here:

It connects to B on the left side of the plenum.
