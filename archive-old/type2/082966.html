Subject: Spare Tire Gas Tank

Well after all the hype in February / March I took the plunge 
and bought a spare tire gas tank on eBay. It just arrived 
today and I LOVE it! It is slightly tapered on one side and 
fits PERFECTLY into my 15&quot; SA Rhein Wheels. It has a 9L 
capacity which is roughly 2 1/2 gallons). For pics take a 
look at the sold item at:

http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=1807364597

If you want one for yourself the guy seems to list them 
fairly regularly. I can't say for sure if his 14&quot; tank will 
fit stock 14&quot; wheels... I just took the chance that the 15&quot; 
version would fit my wheels and it did. I will post a pic 
with the tank inside the Rheins on my website when I get my 
film developed (no digital camera).

I have no financial interest in these items and although I 
can say that my transaction went smoothly I cannot vouch for 
the seller personally. Shipping was a BIT on the slow side 
three weeks to Canada. 

Thanks,
Chris
