I too had the same situation in my city (Corona, Ca, 30mi south of Scott same 
Nazi's). A neighbor had reported me cause my trailer had a load of brush in 
the front yard, hmmm, I'm clearing brush to lay brick and improve property 
values. While he was there the inspector noted the bus out front and told me 
I wasn't allowed a non-op vehicle in the driveway. Mind you the only way to 
tell it was non-op was to lift the lid, it was otherwise complete. I made the 
inspector mail me the pertinent city code which laid out the violations and 
the process. Bottom line, if I did nothing the city would take my bus and 
bill me for the privilege. At the deadline I moved the bus in the garage and 
finished the engine rebuild. When I was done I promptly moved the bus back 
into the same spot. Lesson here is to use the code against them. In our town 
it said &quot;must be operable or be enclosed or be behind a 5 foot fence&quot; it said 
nothing about being registered. I've rambled to long but we've got to push 
back or we'll end up like Mission Viejo where its illegal to change your oil 
in your garage!
btw I've got another load of brush in the front yard ; )
