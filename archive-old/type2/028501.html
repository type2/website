I *always* completely disassemble and antiseptically clean every component
upon rebuilding anything.  If you can't put it in your bed, it's not ready
to reassemble ;-)  You don't want the old grease in there do you?  YUCK!!
Not to mention the worn bearing metal.

My front bearings have always seen clean moly every 30K miles.  They seem to
like it as much as I.

I agree with you on mixing greases.

Subject: RE: [T2] Bearing Grease

&gt;&gt;Does anyone know of a good wheel bearing grease that resists flow due to
&gt;&gt;the combined effects of heat and centrifugal force?
&gt;
&gt;Using my fav...Valvoline Moly grease, I would,

Steve makes a lot of good points but something to recall is that it is a
bad idea to mix moly and ole fashion grease.  So if you want to go for
the moly (I like the Valv semi-synthetic which I use in CV's) you got to
clean everything out with solvent which can be a royal PITA.  I tend
to use the cheapo coastal or Unilube &quot;high temp wheel bearing&quot; grease
