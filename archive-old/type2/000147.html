Well, we successfully made the PCH 2 Cruise no problems.  But I started 
noticing a noise in the left rear wheel area.  I took the wheel off and 
looked for signs of wear, wheel bearings, cv, axle.  But found nothing out of 
the ordinary.  It was kinda of like when you put weight on the shocks and let 
go kinda squeaking combined with a little thumping.  I did nothing but play 
with a boot and wiggle the axle in and out, got frustrated at the bolts 6mm 
stripping and put it back together.  The noise is gone (momentarily I'm sure) 
what gives any similar stories out there????  I just hate to wait until it 
breaks to know for sure.
Peace Out
