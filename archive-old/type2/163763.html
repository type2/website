Subject: Re: [T2] water injection on a fuel injection engine

I'm interested as well, and don't think it's a pipe dream. People have apparently used a hypodermic syringe needle and pierced the vacuum line that feeds the distributor in carbureted versions, so I wonder if this would be the same for fuel injected. The needle accesses the vacuum you're after, and also acts as a metering device. Off the top of my head however, I can't remember where the source for the dizzy vacuum is on our 2L engines. I will check this out. The benefits of water injection have been known forever, but I only know of one fellow who used it on an aircooled engine, and that was a modified 1776 with twin dellorto carbs in a bug. He swore by it's benefits however. I am not sure what the consequences would be in a fuel injected motor as to altering mixture, cylinder temp sensors etc etc.
