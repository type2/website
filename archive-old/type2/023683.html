I'm looking for a place where I can find decent radios for my 72 westy that
aren't too expensive.  I'd like to find a tape deck with one of those fake
alarm lights, and a CD input.  Also I'm planning on installing a bass kicker
for the &quot;Ghetto Cruiser&quot; anybody else try this, i'm thinking of putting it
under the main couch/backseat.  And I'm planning on installing 6x9 speakers in
the hatchback, anybody try this too?
Thanks,
Capt Tripps
