Again you don't get it. You DON'T ever answer any questions.

I asked you questions in my reply. What do I get for an answer?  &quot;witty&quot;.....and name calling..

Where is your answer to this section??


&quot;&gt;I said the Mallory has improved power UP TO 25hp (I suggest you re-read my
posts). I never guaranteed joe blow 25hp by putting one in. You have seen
one too many used car commercials, and could win the Olympics with your
Conclusions Jumping abilities.

*Guess what, sparky...... you forgot what you wrote:

Jake Raby has seen a 25hp difference by adding a Unilite.

NO where does the words UP TO appear. No, you can't answer anything.....
Wait, I take that back. You did say:  &quot;since you seem to feel my position as selling more then any
other VW Vendor in the World is somehow making me cross the line into lying.&quot;
Yep, you did cross the line. I just looked again.... UP TO did not magically appear.
All you do is sell, not answer questions. 
I am done.
