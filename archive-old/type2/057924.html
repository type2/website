Subject: '82 Transporter ECU technical problems.

G'day from downunder.  . .A technical question.  I'll try to be brief.

BACKGROUND:  I am having trouble with the ECU in my '82 aircooled Automatic 
Transporter.  (Problems first occurred 5+years ago and are worse.)  The Bosch ECU 
service people here (one of whom is a serious VW-head) can't help because of the 
intermittent nature of the problem.  SO I am looking for a second hand ECU (Bosch 
Jetronic ECU, VW part number is 039 906 021 C, Bosch Part Number 0280 000 180, 
Bosch rebuilt Number CU 103 X). I believe the 79-83 automatic models all had the same 
ECU.  I found one available in the US, but it will cost me an arm and a leg, and I 
couldn't work on the vehicle with only one of each.  I am looking at alternatives.

The VW Part 039 906 021 B (Bosch rebuilt as CU 102 X) is from the same model 
MANUAL vehicle and I can get one locally.

The ECU is a box of analog circuitry - NO brain at all.  Lot's of resistors, diodes etc.

QUESTION:  Can I use the 'manual' ECU for the automatic vehicle?

EVIDENCE:  I know there is a small difference in the idle-speed range of the engines of 
the manual vs auto (Bentley).  This I presume is trivial in the scheme of things.  I am 
ALSO told by local a VW mechanic that the cam shafts are different (manual vs 
automatic), so he would think I might not be able to use the 'manual' ECU.  (Bentley 
makes no reference to the camshaft issue.)

A top notch professional engine tuner/tweaker/modifyer who lives and breathes EFI 
and with no vested interests tells me that because of the crude nature of the (VW) 
ECU in that era (he knows them), there should be no problem in using the 'manual' 
ECU in my vehicle.  He says that if I run the 'manual' ECU in the vehicle and when 
cruising I can measure a Air/Fuel ratio of 13.8/1 - 15.5/1 AND when idling I have a ratio 
of 10/1 - 12.8/1 then I should have NO problems at all.  The engine will not be damaged 
and I will have reasonable performance (i.e. little different to 'normal'). (This fellow was 
pretty reassuring.)

Can anyone please comment on the above?

Does anyone have any circuits for the ECUs?  Can anyone tell me where I could find 
these (not the Service Manuals).  Can I find out just WHICH components differ 
between these obviously close ECUs? (I am competent to go to work with an iron!)

Can I use the 'manual' ECU for the automatic vehicle?  I am keen to get authoritative 
views on the question - so I can get my car back on the road reliably.

If anyone actually HAS the ECU I need (at a reasonable price), of course I am still 
interested in it. I have tried numerous sources in USA, Canada, UK, Germany, 
Australia, NZ.

ALL suggestions (of answers OR of directions to which I can pass my question) 
gratefully received.

Warm regards to the patient ones.
