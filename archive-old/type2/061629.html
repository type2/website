&gt; There I purchased a PVC bend with an outside diameter of practically
57 mm.

hose, clamped

&gt; If anyone knows any problems that I may face with this installation,
please
&gt; reply.

I don't know if I would be comfortable with this until I knew what
happens to PVC in long-term contact with gasoline.  It might be just
dandy, but it would be comforting to know that for sure.  Anyone know
of an application that uses PVC with gasoline?

Secondly, be sure to remove any protrusion from the ID of the PVC
fitting.  The outer surfaces need to be smooth for a good seal.  Don't
expect the hose to fill in little nooks and crannies in the
hose-fitting interface.

If the PVC is OK with gas, this sounds like an ideal solution!
