&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I searched the archive, but it was just giving me broken images and
&gt; &quot;ht://Dig 3.1.5&quot; as a response. Don't know what's up with that...
&gt; 
&gt; We've been having problems with our electrical system for a while
&gt; (original generator and second but old Sears voltage regulator PO
&gt; installed) and figured that since replacements are necessary that we
&gt; would upgrade to an alternator. What is the general opinion on Kymco's
&gt; Super 75 alternator kit? Worth it? Junk? Should be just get the factory
&gt; 55amp alternator? Will there be a problem with our doghouse cooler?

Well, are you using anything that overtaxes the existing generator?  About
the only thing I can imagine is if you run a lot of off-road lights.  On
my old Datsun 510 &quot;rally&quot; car I ran about 500W of lights and the battery
would go flat after about an hour with all systems ablaze as the
alternator couldn't keep up.  I replaced the stock alternator with a Delco
and that solved the problem.

If you aren't overtaxing the existing generator there is little reason to
spend big $$$ for the Kymco alternator.  You will do just fine with the
stock Bosch alternators and it's quite likely that Bosch will still be
around when you need parts for the alternator.

BTW, big stereos don't really need extra charging capacity.  They may draw
big amperage from the battery for momentary loud sounds 
(Thump...Thump...Thump) but most of the time they only draw a few amps.

The Kymco kits may be useful for situations where you _really_ need the
extra power, but don't buy it just because the advertised numbers are
larger.
