&gt; I have a 1977 Westy, it is loud inside.

&gt; I borrowed a decibel meter from work Friday to test it on my way home.
&gt;
&gt; Any suggestions on the quietest exhaust?

that was my first question, a good condition stock exhaust should not
be that loud. and a Westy has good insulation.

I would check the pad over the engine, but you also have a mattress up
there for sound deadening yes??
