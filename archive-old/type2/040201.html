Subject: Seat Belts

     Hello!
(Hopefully) a quick and easy question:  I need lap belts for the rear 
seat of my '78 transporter.  The standard VW magazines always have ads 
for lap belts which look like just what I need, but I have one nagging 
worry before I plunks down my bucks.  I'm worried that, since they're 
marketed at bug people, they may not be long enough to work in my bus.  I 
don't have a bug to compare anchor points but I assume the lengths would 
be different (for all I know, a bus belt might need to be shorter!).  Has 
anyone bought these, and is there enough length for them to work in the 
rear seat of my bus?
     Thank you!

     ~Brian
