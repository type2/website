Subject: Re: [T2] Painting The Pop Top

Tim,

By popular consensus---brushing and rolling is the only way to go---

I would never do it that way---( Phooey )
But there seems to be a vast majority that prefer's his method here on
the type 2 list----

One note of warning.--

If the glass is in that bad of shape-and open--YOU MUST SEAL IT PRIOR TO
REFINISHING.

For this let me recommend a excellent product--which is a flexible
sealer/ primer--
Dupont Euro prime.
It is a urethane, flexible product, and works great on fiberglass.
 It is a three part product--and must be sprayed on---let dry for
minimum of six hours--scuff--and then refinish the way that you choose.

At least one product on on the top will be bullet proof--

Roll and brush--yuck---:&gt;)
Caveman style.

Have Fun--

Terry

Hello,
        I'm sorry for the second question. My pop top is
looking kind of dirty. I've tried scrubbing with no luck-it's deep
inside the fiberglass. If I were to paint it, would it look bad if I
were to brush it on nicely since it's such porous material. I was
thinking not, but would hate to find out the hard way.
  Does anyone have any suggestions? Thanks a lot.
Tim
