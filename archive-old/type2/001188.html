Two possibilities come to mind. The accelerator cable linkage could be
binding somewhere. Try pulling up on your gas pedal and listen for a drop in
RPM. Also try pushing down on the throttle arm and make sure it is going
down all the way.Now would be a good time to see if your cable is properly
adjusted to allow the  throttle plate to go thru its full range of movement.

The next thing to check is your choke. With the engine warmed and running,
pull off the air cleaner and make sure that choke plate is vertical. If not
your electric choke could have failed and that would account for your high
RPMs and would also leaving you running a very rich mix. The quick fix on
the choke is to loosen it and rotate it so that it does not engage the cam.
This can make starting the bus a challenge in cold weather but will rid you
of the high idle and the rich running condition. Good luck.
