Subject: [T2] LOUD FUEL PUMP?

Hi Everyone,
Thanks to everyone for all the help I have gotten and I found a vaccum leak but I now have noticed that my fuel pump is really loud ( I can hear it from the drivers seat)  and it sounds like there is a mix of air and fuel going through it.  Anybody every have this problem with a clogged filter or pump about to go? It still idles rough if at all till you get it up to speed bucking some at higher revs or hill climbs,  then if you stop at a light it will idle for about a min or 2. 
Thanks
Kevin
