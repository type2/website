&lt;&lt; Hello Everyone.
My name is Stephanie.
I am the proud owner, as of yesterday, of a Type 2, 1970 CamperVan.
I paid $500, major rust on lower panels, but still smiling here.
I would like to make it into a four wheel drive for trips to Baja.
Does anyone know if this is possible?
Thank you so very much.
 &gt;&gt;

Quite simply, no. What you want is a Synchro.

Alternate answer, yes. Anything is possible with
enough money, time, money, effort, and money... ;-(
