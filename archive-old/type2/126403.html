LoL!!!

$400 is a third of the way to a new engine, or a tenth of the way to a
straight body and new paint!

I just spent $30 on some crap speakers for my bus so I could
(finally!) have tunes. That was hard to part with. The idea of
spending $400 (or even the crappy $200 ones) on a radar detector so I
can feel better about speeding (!) just turns my stomach.

DIZZYPOLISH:

I've finished polishing my dizzy and cleaned up (heh). I clearcoated
the dizzy body, and used blue Metalcast on the vacuum advance and the
condenser. I'd forgotten how long it takes that Metalcast paint to
dry. Minutes? Nope. Couple hours? Uh uh. I painted it last night and
it'll be tonight before I can touch it. Being my impatient self (and
afraid of losing bits) I reassembled it this morning. There's a nice
fingerprint on the condenser now. ;-)

You can see areas I couldn't get the felt tip of my Dremel into. But
they're spots that aren't visible when it's in the bus.

I know the wannabeanodized look just SCREAMS rice, but if our busses
aren't about having fun, then there's no point!

&gt; Send your $400 to me - I can put it to MUCH better use,
&gt; creating a show bus!
