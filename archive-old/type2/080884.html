Subject: Re: [T2] Painting the bus myself...

I've done this-not once but twice. It's a big job, but I,too, was =
motivated by the  big $$$ estimates I got to have a body shop do the =
job. I'd rethink the POR-15 base coat- I don't think POR is intended for =
use on bare metal. My '77 Westy, the one I painted most recently, had =
two repaints over the original Marigold. I stripped it down to bare =
metal, and used Dupont Velvaseal as a base coat. I used a chemical =
stripper to remove the old finish, in some spots it took several coats =
of this nasty stuff to get off all the old paint. Good luck on renting a =
spray booth-I went to several body shops and was turned down by all of =
them. I even offered one guy $200.00 to come in on a Saturday for no =
more than 6 hours-he at least thought about it for a minute before =
saying no-the rest were an immediate &quot;NO&quot;. Check with a local high =
school or vocational school, you may have some luck there, or at worst =
may have to enroll in a class to use their facilities.
Check the yellow pages for automotive paint suppliers, here in N. =
Virginia we have only one that I know of, Mattos, and the folks there =
are great. If your changing colors and replacing window seals, consider =
pulling all the glass and do the painting with the glass out. It sure =
beats all the taping required, and looks a lot better in the end. I =
changes colors, and completely gutted my Westy. Check out my pages for =
some pics of the job. Good luck!   Jeff
