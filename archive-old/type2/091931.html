Subject: Re: [T2] Splitting cases; WHY didn't someone mention this??? :-(


Almost everything you guys are talking about with regards to splitting 
engine cases is Greek to me, but I'll tell you what I would do - though 
this may only work in my garage at home...

This has happened a bunch of times to me, but I'll give you a specific 
example - when I assembled the cv joint the wrong way round, got it 
hopelessly stuck, noway the thing was going to budge one millimeter to 
allow me to put it together the right way - I almost threw it out...but 
I left it alone for a week, came back to it, and it practically fell 
apart in my hands when I picked it up.

What I think is, that my house is haunted by the ghost of a VW mechanic, 
and he helps me out of hopeless situations (and I create a lot of them). 
 Maybe you should just wait a couple of days, see if some &quot;body&quot; splits 
your case for you while you're not looking! : )

Now for my dilemma. The cases are apart about 2.5&quot; and will not go back
&gt; together because one has &quot;fallen&quot; a few degrees out of rotation. Nor can I
&gt; find what is causing it to stay that way. I was able to twist the camshaft
&gt; out and drop the crankshaft *nearly* into its position in one case half.
&gt; However, the other case half will not rotate so that I can rejoin the cases
&gt; to get to the piston circlips. Note, the pistons are up inside the bores, so
&gt; the circlips are not reachable. Since I can't get the case back into
&gt; alignment, I can't withdraw the pistons... the whole rotating assembly is
&gt; locked except for maybe 5 degrees of rotation. Further, I can get only 3 of
&gt; the rod nuts off, so I can't remove the rods.
