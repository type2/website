&gt; I have KYB GR-2's on my 65, along with Yokohama truck tires (ie, proper

&gt; I've driven way too many mushy Type 2s.  Road construction and speed
&gt; bumps are a pain -- I can get air on the latter when unladen unless I
&gt; pretty much slow to a roll.  But I like having the stiffness for loads,
&gt; dirt roads, and driving thru the woods, and on pavement it's nice to
&gt; have a (relatively speaking) slotcar-ish suspension &amp; wheels.  (1600sp
&gt; engine, no mods.)

I've come to the conclusive that they are budget gas shocks and not very
good. The bus needs an oil filled shock.
