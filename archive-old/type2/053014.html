Subject: Pop Top Straps

I wanted to post this about my pop top straps.  Maybe it will help some.  
The PO on our bus had a pretty good idea so here goes.

Instead of using the black rubber straps that are connected to the metal 
hinge on the pop top, he has a big thick screw type thing. It has threads at 
the tip. It has a hole going through the screw head(or where a screw head 
would be).  This attaches to the thin metal rod in the metal pop top hinge 
on the top of the pop top.  Then where the black rubber piece would attach 
at the bus roof(in that horseshoe lookin thing), he has a huge circle bolt 
that he screws onto the thick metal rod.  you just use a wrench and tighten 
that baby down.  So there is no room for the pop top to even move.
Make sure that the screws that attach the actuall hinge to the pop top and 
bus roof are sturdy and in there strong.

It works pretty well.  I was having the pop top problems in the gorge in 
oregon which I posted about in the winter.  I wanted original looking.  Not 
some big huge metal screw thing.  So I just put what the previous owner had 
on.  Not a problem since.  Ah well, I guess sometimes the PO does have 
better ideas ;)
