&gt;What do people do to replace the rubber hose on the injectors? I've got my

Some of them!

Use Continental 7mm high pressure fuel line or the 7.5mm FI hose from the Mercedes dealer.

At least when my bus was built, most of the fuel hose used wasn't the reinforced variety.  It was the cloth braided style and it rots and cracks at the edges and leaks easily:

The hose used on each injector and from the fuel rail to the pressure regulator was better quality and reinforced internally but as you can see in the image below, it still cracks and leaks:
