Hi,

&gt; We're all familiar with the spare tire mounted on the front of a bus,
&gt; but has anyone mounted a spare on the back hatch

 It's not unusual to see rear mounted spares here in the UK. I think
there were a couple of the local conversion companies that used to 
do this as part of their standard camper setup to make more space
inside.

 The weight of the wheel doesn't go onto the hatch, though, there's
a frame that attaches to the bumper (maybe with a hinge type 
arrangement to swing it out of the way to access the hatch and
engine bay).
 I think I've seen a couple of different arrangements- some more
complex than others but I don't know if they were produced at
different times, with the design evolving, concurrently with
different prices/features or both.

 I've had a hunt around for a picture of one, but not been able
to dig one up, sorry.

 It's occurred to me in the past that you could get a complete
set of spare wheels by using the interior slot, a nose mount
a rear mount and the roofrack... Ideal for those 
transcontinental trips. :-)

Cheers,
	  W.
