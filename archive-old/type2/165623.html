Subject: Re: [T2] Rear Heater &quot;accordion&quot; tubes content 

i am not wanting to start an asbestos debate,
but my house and my barn have asbestos shingles
and they are wonderful.. don't burn.  don't move
thermally at all and thus paint stays on them
seemingly forever.  don't rot in any way.  zero
mantainance and zero fire risk.
