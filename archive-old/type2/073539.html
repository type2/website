Wow!

First off, thanks to all of you who replied.  Each and every comment was a help
to me in my decision.  I have, of course, decided to NOT sell the van.  Just
today I got a new windshield (old one was horribly cracked) and every day I look
forward to seeing my van in good shape sometime in the future. 

Unfortunately I can't sell or use money from the sale of the Ford, and I can't
have both cars. However, I can see now that the van will bring me many happy
years to come, whereas the Ford... well it would just be a car. 

Thanks again. I am quite pleased to feel a part of such a kind and devoted group
of people brought together by the common love of a vehicle.

I think there should be something in science called 
the &quot;reindeer effect.&quot; I don't know what it
would be, but I think it'd be good to hear
someone say, &quot;Gentlemen, what we have 
here is a terrifying example of the reindeer 
effect.&quot;
