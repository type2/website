Eron,

Sigh, *where* can one findthe fiberglass reinforced version.

Never tell 600 people about something cool and don't tell them where they 
can get it!&lt;grin&gt;

Since we are now losing a lot of the quoted material, I don't remember 
where the original post said to go.

Cheers ,dave

&gt; 	Did you try using a commercial heat gun?  They resemble a hair dryer, but 
&gt; get VERY hot(up to 600 degrees I think)

&gt; &gt;HEATER BLOWER HOSES
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Over the past 10 years I have bought many replacement hoses that are 
&gt; &gt;designed to connect the Beetle shroud to the heater boxes or on the Type IV 
&gt; &gt;connect the aux blower to the heater boxes. Some of the replacement hoses 
&gt; &gt;are black aluminum hoses and some were bright silver. I think I have a 
&gt; &gt;cheap source for you.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; These are actually produced in a fiberglass-reinforced version as well.  
&gt; MUCH stronger, and better insulated for hear transfer.
