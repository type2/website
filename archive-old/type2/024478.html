Subject: Carver P4 installation, Part 3 (how does that voltage regulator work ?)
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Hey it's been several weeks since I last posted my progress on the P4
installation.

I had completed and tested the P4, but had not tried it out yet, and still
haven't fully tested it.  

I tried it out on a trip last weekend, but the coldest it got was the upper
forties, and I insisted on firing it up while we drove the 5 hour trip.  I had
mounted the blower near the floor dead center in the kick panel under the rear
seat, and the kids complained that it was much too hot back there even though
I kept having them turn the heater down.

The Carver instructions say you can use it while driving, but I had my doubts.
The unit did shut off once during the trip, but fired right back up.  I'm not
sure if it blew out, or shut it's self down.  I am very impressed with the
amount of heat that this thing puts out.  I can't wait to try it out camping.
If only we would get some cold weather here in St. Louis.  It's been up to 70
degrees the past week.

Part of my delay in trying the heater out was getting my aux battery to work.
I traced the wiring, and hooked up the relay, but was not getting any voltage
from the relay switch wire that comes from the regulator.  Now I replaced my
regulator quite a few years ago with an electronic unit if that makes any
difference.  I checked my volt meter up front and found no problems.  The
needle move upwards when I stepped on the gas, so I assumed the batter was
charging.  So why was I not getting any voltage from the regulator?  Finally,
I kept the voltmeter on the wire as I revved the engine, I got volts!

Is this normal for a regulator to not spit out voltage when at idle?  I can
see how this would keep your spare battery from draining your system when the
alternator is not providing enough juice.

Enough rambling.  Bring on the cold!
