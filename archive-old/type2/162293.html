Subject: Re: [T2] More Insurance Questions

Don,

Comprehensive is all about damage to your vehicle.

It is my understanding that if you don't have comprehensive
from *your* insurance company, that the other insurance company is not 
going to pay anything either....or at minimal, blue book.

On the other hand, whether it is your fault or the other guy's fault, 
*your* insurance company will pony up the bucks and then *they* fight with
the other insurance company about the amount.

I'm betting that for items like agreed value, they have a &quot;gentlemen's&quot;
agreement on the settlement.  Anyone who has a vehicle with an agreed 
value policy is generally a gold mine....*and* someone who cares 
passionately about the car that has a policy like that.


Cheers, dave

&gt; The thread about insurance has me wondering...
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Agreed Value&quot; (or whatever your company calls it) is only if you have
&gt; comprehensive coverage, correct? It doesn't matter for liability? Example:
 If I'm in an accident that's not my fault, I just have to prove the true
 replacement value to the other company (and convince them to pay that
 instead of blue book). Is that correct? Or is an agreed value necessary with
 my own insurance company as well even though they aren't covering that?
