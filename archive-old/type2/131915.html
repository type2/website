Subject: Re: [T2] Re-calibrating AFM?

I got to disagree here.  People are &quot;assuming&quot; that their AFM is the problem
with their condition.  It may or may not be.  But when you mess with spring
tension on such a precision instrument, without any way of testing the
results other than seat of the pants, you could be running lean at speed and
burn up a motor.

I do not believe in guesswork.
