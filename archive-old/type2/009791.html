I've had this happen before.  I probably should lube the cable somewhere
sometime in the future, but for the time being I've found that flicking the
speedometer directly on the needle where it is wobbling seems to settle it
down and alleviate the problem.  Mine was wobbling consistenly at about 53
mph several months back, and the flick has done the trick since then.  The
time before that as well.  (I got this tip from a former Bug owner and
current Bus owner.)  Good Luck.
