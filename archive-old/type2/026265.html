Subject: 2.0 liter CR: 7.4 - 7.5
Message-ID: &lt;BOHIPCILIJJKBAAA_at_theglobe_dot_com&gt;

Unless I do something differently, it looks like my compression ratio will be about 7.4-7.5, depending on how much crush I get once the heads are torqued. This is for a 2.0 liter FI engine. Any experiences with these higher CRs on 2.0 liters would be appreciated. Bentley calls for 7.3 as spec on the '77  2.0 liter, which is what I have. I'm thinking I'll be locked into mid-octane gas with a CR of 7.4.

I'll probably use the Wests' formula for determining true CR once the engine is running. I never took physics, but they're really cool. This formula I'm speaking of can be found in the archives when you search on &quot;compression ratio.&quot; It uses compression test readings to determine actual compression ratios, which, when you think about it are more precisely determined by measuring than calculating.

Well, thought I'd ask for your experiences. Now I'm gonna to out and remeasure that deck height one more time with the cylinders torqued down some (broke a fin last time I tried this). Wish me luck!

Thanks! Joe
