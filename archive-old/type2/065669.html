Subject: Van Heater System Re-design

        Since everyone is bracing for the winter
(me included if I get my FI figured out so it runs at all),
I thought I would mention a brief ,um, a brief.

        For the ThermoFluids System Design class I am taking,
the design group I am in has chosen to &quot;re-design&quot; the heating
system on the VW Bus.

        Hopefully what this means is that we will use our sub-par
heat transfer knowledge to improve the heating system by adding
insulation strategically, or fans, heatexchagners, etc.

        I mention this becuase we anticipate coming up with some
simple little improvements that will be of interest to all
Frozen bus owners.

        Also, if anyone has any specific info on the system as it exists,
I would appreciate it. I have the BA6 repair manual....

Thanks,
Matt.
