Subject: Re: [T2] VW Bus Junk Yard recycling

My mind must have tried to forget that episode. Middle of summer, 1960 bus out in the sand, glued down shag and I needed a beltline down clip for a '65 21 window. Somehow I had the bright idea of renting a gas powered chop saw with a 14&quot; diameter metal cutting blade. Cut the windows, ends down to the floor, then the floor. Not enough blade to the jackpoints from above, so I'm upside down in sand, 100+ degrees, with a snarling, dripping 2 cycle motor and a shower of sparks. Yup, my mind nearly forgot that. Thanks, Karl. Some Hungry Hippo dude in Colorado has that clip in his '65 21 window.

&gt; And Harry neglected to mention using a metal cutting
&gt; saw when we cut the whole drivers side off a split bus
&gt; for his 65 21 window.  I can't remember if it was gas
&gt; or electric......
