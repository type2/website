Last week, somebody on this list mentioned that some members on this list paid an &quot;outrageous&quot; price for their type T2s, but actually the high price is what these things are going for ........in excellent condition that is!!! A friend of mine gave me a copy of the N.A.D.A collector and rare vehicle price list, and in it, most busses in excellent condition go for $8,000 US. and up!!
Campers are always higher priced than the panel cargo van, or the passenger bus. I would hate to see the prices of these things in 20 years from now....
