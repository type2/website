&gt; These are the steps I follow;

Thanks, Richard.  Printed them out and the very first thing to do turned up
a problem.

When I turn the key in the ignition to &quot;start&quot;, the headlights go out (good
so far), but the idiot lights do not dim.  The sound of the aftermarket fuel
pump seemed to lessen a very, very tiny bit, but it could almost be a
figment of the imagination.

Not that I want to delve into anyone's possibly larcenous past, but is there
a non-destructive method of bypassing the ignition switch that will allow me
to start the bus?  Giacomo is my primary vehicle, and I need him running in
order to get parts.

I'm looking at possibly getting a used ignition switch from a local VW mech.
Is going used a good idea/bad idea?  Whether new or used, is it possible to
re-key the ignition to match the door keys ($11.00 last week for keys, don't
really want to waste it)?

Thanks for the help.  I don't know how I'd get back into buses without this
group of wonderful people.

Hmm... perusing dim memories of owning a car that had a starter button on
the floor.  Key on, push floor button, varoom!  I guess I really am turning
47 this weekend!
