Subject: Re: [T2] Hydraulic Lifter Bore Question

&gt; TGIF!
&gt; I split the case of a '79 Hydraulic Short Block last weekend. As I was
&gt; cleaning the Case halves I noticed ridges in the Lifter Bores. I have never
&gt; noticed these before in any of the Type I cases that I have had dealings
&gt; with. Does anybody know if this is common? Will these have to be reemed?
&gt; Does this mean that the case is junk. I will be splitting another one this
&gt; weekend ('78) and I hope to not see these there(fingers crossed).

it may mean the case is bad. i have seen this a few times.

you can have the case machined for oversize lifters, but the only ones
available are ceramic from LN engineering and they cost over 400 bucks. it
may be cheaper to get a different case. the case can also be sleeved for
type one lifters, as is done in some instances when people want to use very
large lift cams, but again, these are expensive solutions.
