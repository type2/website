Subject: eGroups type2 Chat (offtopic)

List,

-please excuse non-bus content-  i come in peace... don't shoot...

Okay, i know some are already frowning, but i just wanted to remind
listmembers that since this list filters through eGroups
http://www.eroups_dot_com, all of us can use the little chatroom at
http://www.egroups_dot_com/ChatPage?listName=type2.  Only registered members of
this list can get in this room.

True: Using an irc client is faster and easier for most, but for those of us
who may not be able to install anything or are told not to chat or are
restricted in other network-related ways, it makes a quick little internet
based, private (well - listmembers only) chatroom that cuts across firewalls
and your boss won't know about it unless he's actually looking over your
shoulder.

http://www.egroups_dot_com/ChatPage?listName=type2

If you never have, the eGroups site will probably ask you to register so it
can send you a cookie, but because of that cookie, you won't need to register
again.

Just thought this might be handy as a 'favorite' when we feel like taking a
discussion off list and don't want to sit there and volley emails back and
forth.


 This has been another unsolicited public service announcement from,
