&gt;Somebody give him a grand for this thing already.  It runs and it
&gt;is a Champagne '78 passenger.  I mean interiors like that fortunately
&gt;don't get made anymore 8-)  I mean brown dash, and LOOK at those
&gt;kick panels and interior panels, let alone the brown cord seats.

And the radio block-off plate. Don't forget about that. :-)
