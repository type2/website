Hi,

In an effort to make owning a bus more fun, VW engineered in some time
delayed features into my bus. The latest feature is make its appearance is
&quot;hi-signals.&quot; This is an exciting new feature where upon fully engaging the
right turn signal the high beams come on. On the lucky occasions when the
self canceling feature works this phenomenon reverses itself. This feature
is not dependent on the headlights being switched on.

A quick review of wiring and dimmer relay did not reveal the method by the
hi-signals operate. A closer inspection is in order but I just might wait
for Fox to do a special on buses: &quot;VW Bus Secrets Revealed.&quot;
