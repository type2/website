Tim,
I'm sure i won't be the only one to respond, but those are fuel
evaporation/return lines in place for the fuel injection system.  I'd say fix
em' - they are joined by VW fuel hose just above your head if you stick it
(your head) in the engine compartment.  Usually this hose (like most of the
other fuel hose on these ol' busses) is dry-rotted and can leak.  Check the
archives at http://www.type2_dot_com for more info or study your Bentley manual.
Good luck and don't drive with a fuel leak!

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm relatively new to all this so please excuse my ignorance.  I have a
&gt; 78 bus and recently I have been smelling a lot of gas when I fill up. 
&gt; I noticed it dripping the last fill.  From ideas what it may be from
&gt; the archives, I opened up the panel and discovered one of the two
&gt; yellow lines was undone from the elbow peice going in the tank.  This I
&gt; feel was the problem, but what are these lines and am I correct in
&gt; thinking this indeed is the solution.
&gt; Thanks alot,
&gt; Tim Pries
