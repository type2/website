Subject: Accel cable for auto tranny
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I have a quick question. On my 78 auto the PO had done away with the FI and 
replaced with a Solex carb. I am currently restoring my bus and replacing the 
FI. Question is that on the Solex conversion there was a stiff metal rod that 
connected to the auto tranny to the linkage on the carb. However on the parts 
bus that I am getting the FI components from there was a cable from the 
tranny(manual) to the carb. Is the connection from tranny to linkage supposed 
to be the rod or the cable? I ordered a new accel cable from the bus depot 
that goes from the tranny connection to the pedal but they said they didn't 
know about from the tranny to linkage. 

Any and all info would be appreciated

Thanks
Waldo
