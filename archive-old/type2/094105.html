Subject: cam/contact lube

I did my first tune-up yesterday using a timing light and dwell meter.  On
the first attempt I managed to get the dwell to 50 degrees.  I had trouble
measuring the original points gap because some of one contact had melted
onto the other half.

Bentley says 44-50 is acceptable for new points.  Do I want to get within
range more?

Also, the contact set didn't come with any lubricant.  It seems none do
anymore and you can't get it at FLAPS.  I did find one store that gave me a
little red capsule pill that I could use.

Is there a lube substitute for this particular application or is this
unnecessary these days?
