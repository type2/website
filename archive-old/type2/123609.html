Subject: Re: [T2] headliner conversion

&gt;...
&gt;In the westys there is a small metal strip that is secured to the body that
&gt;the headliner fits into.  Without the strip, the headliner would not want to
&gt;stay to the curve of the roof, I'm sure glue would be a waste of time, that
&gt;heavy headliner material doesn't want to bend easily and the glue couldn't
&gt;hold it.

that is what i assumed - anyone have a good pic to send me? perhaps i 
can fab something up.......
