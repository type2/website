Subject: new type 2
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

I will never sell my 74. That being said, I think the &quot;new
bus will be great!
  Its as close to a &quot;new bus&quot; as you will get in this
country ever again and in twenty years the &quot;Tribe&quot; will
still be wandering the highways because of it. May not be
the exact same tradition as we have today but it is nice to
know something will remain of this mysterious attachment to
the bus and the other Volks who drive em.
  I seem to remember some unflattering comments directed
towards the Type2 back when I was in High School... I have
also heard some unflattering comments about the Bay Window
thing that I drive from Splitty fanatics..... &lt;sigh&gt;
  History repeats..

       Peace, Dan_at_Seattle
