Subject: Second Annual WetWesties/Bus Pilots Reunion Info &amp; Links

Good morning all,

This is a recap of the message sent last week with a few new items.  I've
prefaced the new stuff with &lt;new&gt; in case you are in a time crunch.

Just a reminder for the PNW listmembers.  The Second Annual
WetWesties/Bus Pilots Reunion is just a week away. (September 25-27)

Come join us for a relaxing time swapping lies, meeting new (and old)
friends, going on the always exciting WetWesties exclusive &quot;Bus Tour&quot;
and generally just having a good time.

This event is held in a small state park in the Blue Mountains of
Eastern Oregon. (Centrally located between Idaho listees and
Oregon/Washington listees.)  For Oregon Parks and Recreation
Department's description of the campground try:

(Note that we historically have taken all the sites beyond the east
loop. Two buses to a site seems to work well.)

&lt;new&gt;
Lisa and I ran up to the park yesterday morning and inspite of being &quot;bow
season&quot; the park was EMPTY!  That means that we very well might be able to
fill a state park with VWs!  Wouldn't that be a photo op!

&lt;new&gt; 
We would like to do a pot-luck on Saturday afternoon/night.  Lisa has a bunch
of trout that needs to be eaten and would appreciate hearing from others in
order to coordinate.  Please drop her a line at mailto::whitedov_at_eoni_dot_com.
 
&lt;new&gt;
Fred Stoermer is coming from the Seatac area and asked that any listees that
coming from western WA get in touch with him.  mailto::klamjoose_at_classic.msn_dot_com
