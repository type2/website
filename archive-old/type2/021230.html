&gt; Any further opposing viewpoints? :-)

Steve:
Well, life is just too short for me to waste time on getting the CV parts
surgically clean, and Ben Pon's ghost will just have to come lookin'.
I recently serviced the joints on the 87 before one of our 72 hr, 2500 mile
jaunts to the east coast.
Had one of my workers took off the right axles and handed it to me, which I
popped off the one cv joint, put on a  new boot, wiped off the old grease with
a few paper towels, put the joint back on and flipped it over and did the
other, filled both back up with grease and handed it back to him just as he
finished removing the left one. He installed this as I changed the left boots
and re greased. He then installed the left axle back on the right position. His
time, about 1 hr, mine, about 35 minutes. Three of these joints have 115,000
miles on them, the fourth self destructed as I listened to it for 1-1/2 years,
knock, knock. (several years ago, before this fella worked for me!)
The only difference between these joints and those on an air-cooled vanagon is
that these turn faster! (Did lotsa 48 second miles on that last trip- pulling a
trailer.)
I guarantee mine was the dirtiest Vanagon at the Porsche swap meet in Hershey!
