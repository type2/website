Subject: RE: [T2] SVDA in a 1600 DP

To All,

Sometimes issues are totally unrelated to what one thinks it is.

I got some better light on the situation (actual light) this morning and saw
the distributor clamp was bent just enough that the dizzy was raised up and
the cam was disengaging. I fixed it by putting a washer under the hold down
clamp on the engine block.

Now it hums right along solid as a rock. John at acn sells a really nice
product, provided you don't have a bent distributor clamp!

Thanks for all the troubleshooting help you guys! I now am a bit wiser on
the idiosyncrasies of the mystical SVDA installation into a type 1 motor. I
can't wait to see what the performance is like. But I need brakes first...

Thanks again to you all.

Jon Stiles
