Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust header gaskets

Hi Guys,

What I do is tap them gently on edge with a hammer from the side so  
as to make them ever so slightly longer than the ports they are  
fitting into. Then I wedge them into place and use a chisel or  
screwdriver to tap them home against the exhaust surface where they  
belong. Once they are in place, they stay there, and you can focus on  
the task of getting the headers or heater boxes tightened up without  
breaking or stripping a stud.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
