&lt;&lt; Can
anyone point me in a good direction to get started (books, web sites) I
mostly have surface rust that I want to nip in the butt, but I don't
want to roll around with a bunch of primer for the next 5 years :) I
know there has been some discussion as to the how to's but I'm a visual
guy and I like pictures.
Thanks  &gt;&gt;

Try

&lt;&lt;  www.motorbooks_dot_com  &gt;&gt;

Get their paper catalog... ;-)
