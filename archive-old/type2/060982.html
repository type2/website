&gt;I bought the bus depot   'seat pedestal covers'. They are IMHO high
&gt;quality, but they only cover the outside of the pedestal.


Actually, the section that covers the insides of the pedestals (toward the
&quot;walkthru&quot; section) just became available for the first time in years.  I
have 4 sets so far, for $39.95 per pair.
