Subject: RE: [T2] New Dakota Digital CHT Gauge Installed - Temp &amp;
  Mixture Questions

Thanks to you Richard and all who relied to my post.  I feel better having a
CHT gauge and now, with all of your help, I've got some baselines to judge
how my bus is running.

Regards,

Wayne
'79 Westy, no longer temp challenged.

-----Original Message----- Richard 

I consider 300F to be warmed up. Simply idling the engine in the driveway it
may never get to that temperature and perhaps top off at 280F.

Once I'm driving around I find the temperature to be 300-310F at stop
lights, 300-330F in the city and 340F-400F on the highway. As I attempt to
go faster than 65mph, the temps go over 400F and increase the faster I go. I
chose to set the annuciator on the DD gauge to 410-420F but that's only
applicably for my bus...

One thing I noticed recently is that the nominal idling CHT can vary from
bus to bus. For example the bus I tuned up for smog a week ago ran 30F
hotter at idle so naturally the other temperatures are 30F higher.
