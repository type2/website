&gt; 1) I replaced my regular fuel line, but I've learned that my Bus has 
&gt; some
&gt; sort of wild fuel evap system with a series of tubes that run all along
&gt; the inner wals of my Bus (including in the area where the engine vents
&gt; are). Do I need to replace these rubber fittings in between there? It
&gt; appears to me as if my fuel tank isn't even hooked up to this evap 
&gt; set-up
&gt; anymore. I am completely missing that evaporative canister that I
&gt; normally see hanging above in other busses. I have that long oblong
&gt; shaped bracket, but there is nothing in there. Is it important that I
&gt; re-install this?

What year is your Bus?  What is the location of the charcoal can 
bracket?  Do you have carbs or FI?

I personally like having the tank vent system hooked up, as it helps to 
reduce hydrocarbon emissions.  If you're not concerned about that, then 
you probably need to do something to plug / redirect the vent lines; 
it's probably not a good idea to have the vapor from the tank just 
floating around in your engine compartment.  I will let someone else 
comment on the specifics of doing this, though.

&gt; 2) I have a sensor attached to the end of my transmission, well.. there
&gt; are two. One is for the reverse light, and the other apparently, when I
&gt; looked it up in my Bentley catalog,  is engaged when I go into 4th 
&gt; gear.
&gt; Why do I need this? Maybe I didn't look in the right place, but is this
&gt; supposed to hook up to anything?.. like, maybe a light on the Dash?
&gt; (OverDrive or something?)

What page in Bentley describes this other sensor / switch?  (I'm not 
familiar with it, mostly because I haven't had to become close personal 
friends with my transmission yet.)  The wiring diagram in Bentley 
should show what the switch connects to.  Pretty sure there's no &quot;Over 
Drive&quot; light on the dash :-)

&gt; 3) Assuming the timing, cooling, and everything else is correct in my
&gt; Bus... can I install a high-output ignition coil? I have a 12-Volt
&gt; universal Accel Super Coil brand new in the box that I found in the
&gt; garage when I bought my house. It's the same dimensions as the coil in 
&gt; my
&gt; Bus. Will this cause the Bus to run hotter, or will it help improve the
&gt; emissions / power of my Bus?

I'm not sure a high-output coil alone is going to really do much.  I 
guess a h-o coil might allow you to run wider plug gaps, but honestly, 
when properly tuned, my Bus runs *great* with the original 27 year-old 
Bosch black coil.  I think there are better ignition upgrades to be 
had, like installing an electronic ignition in the distributor such as 
Pertronix Ignitor (using the stock Bosch black coil or a Bosch blue 
coil of the correct resistance), or going all the way and installing a 
CDI.

I've heard that CDI can have a real emissions reduction effect, as can 
&quot;second spark&quot; type ignition supplementation systems.

&gt; 4) The floor of the battery tray was rusted out, and the previous owner
&gt; just put sheet after sheet after sheet of fiberglass down, and even
&gt; molded in a piece of wood. I DO have a welder, but wanted to hear from
&gt; some people who have done this. When you welded in a new battery tray,
&gt; what precautions if any did you take. My garage almost always smells 
&gt; like
&gt; gas when I go in there (I think it's comming from the Bus). I assume I
&gt; can get this floor piece from Busted Bus.

If it were me, I'd certainly remove the fuel tank.  If you have the 
engine out anyway, you might as well pull the tank and repair anything 
tank-related that needs it (vent lines, filler neck, fuel gauge sender, 
etc.)
