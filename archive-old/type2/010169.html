    Original Gensler Post &quot;Great Bus Rally Step #1&quot;:
    
       Wow! Lots of interest in this. 
    
    Charlie Ford agrees that compiling the names of potential participation
for
  
    this would be a good first step. And I volunteered to be the repository. 
    The number of responses I get will probably determine some of how this
thing
  
    gets planned out. And of course the route will be based on where we have 
    willing drivers. 
    
    I'm starting to think that rather than a 2-directional competition type 
    thing that maybe we should have a single 'round-the-country' (continent?)

    thing. Picture a route zig-zagging all over the country(s), covering as 
    many places as we've got buses! Pass a camera(s) and log book everytime
you
  
    trade off with each driver logging any comments, scenery, restaurants, 
    roadkill, whatever-tickles-you-fancy in it. Parts of the journey might 
    even be made up of mini caravans and possibly some group-campouts
depending
  
    on the number of participants for the various legs. Then post the whole 
    shabang on a web page complete with pictures, log book entries, 
    drivers/passengers/buses that made each leg, etc. What do you all think of

    this? 
    
    In the mean time, if you're interested in participating, here's what I
need
  
    from you (mail to ME at mike_gensler_at_udscorp_dot_com, not to the list): 
    
    Name: 
    Bus type: 
    City: 
    State: 
    Maximum # of ONE-WAY miles you'd be willing to drive (remember, how ever
far
  
    you drive, you've got to drive to get back home again): 
    
    At this point, this is not a commitment (I know time frames will affect
some
  
    folks). This is just to see if we've got enough interest to make something

    work. After we see how much participation we've got, we'll look at how to

    organize it, plan the route, set a starting time, and start signing people

    up for the various legs and figure out time frames (I expect that to be
the
  
    biggest problem). 
    
    Also, please don't feel that I've &quot;taken over&quot; this idea and am
railroading
  
    it - this is a democratic thing and any and all ideas and suggestions as
to
  
    how this thing should work are welcome. Lets just try to put together 
    something that will be fun for all, give some of us a chance to meet other

    listees, and most important, get out on the road with our great vehicles.

      For what it's worth, I'm in Irving, TX and will gladly contribute if
  there's
    
      a leg ending my way.
