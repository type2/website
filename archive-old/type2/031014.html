&gt; i posted a message a little bit ago asking how to identify the engine in my
&gt; '73 bus.  i was told to check the engine number. well here it is...it's
&gt; CB071120.  i must admit that i have no clue as to what that means...also, i

my engine list has that listed as
72-73
1700 cc
dual carb
manual transmision

&gt; saw a starter (which i need) in a junk-yard the other day.  does it pay to
&gt; get a used one???  or should i just buy a new one???  

for all intents and purposes all starters are &quot;used&quot; since they are
rebuilt.  if the price of the used one is &quot;right&quot; pick it up and have it
rebuilt.  (local place does it for a fraction of the FLAPS price) then
either swap it out for your current one, or keep as a spare.

if the price is too high and you have other wheels, take yours out have it
rebuilt (usually only a one or two day job) and reinstall it
