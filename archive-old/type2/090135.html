Subject: Re: [T2] 32/34 PDSIT CARB SETUP &amp; 72 VAC DIZZY FOR SALE!!!!

Hello list,

I made a little typing error. Here is what I wrote in
the last paragraph.

&quot;I also have a GOOD stock dual vac. advance carb for a
 72 bus&quot;

I ment, &quot; I also have a GOOD stock dual vac. advance
DISTRIBUTOR (not carb) for a 72 bus.&quot; 

Sorry for the type. In short, I have 3 carb setups and
one vac advance dizzy.

Thanks!
David Kelly

 &quot;I also have a GOOD stock dual vac. advance carb
 for a 72 bus.( I looked up the numbers to make sure)
I
 am selling the lot of carburetors with the
distributor
 for $200 OBO. Those coming to High Country Bus
Festival have first dibs. I want to sell this
 stuff as a lot first but can be persuaded to sell the
 Distributor separately. Pleas email me with any
 questions that you might have. Have a great day!&quot;
