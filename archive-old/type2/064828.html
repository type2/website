Subject: PHOOEY on HOT VWs!!!  :-(

Phooey on HOT VW's!!!

Ya know - after a very positive reply to my query
letter - I sent Hot VWs an article and a photo
submission about the resto-customization of 
my '68 Bus - and after SIX months they
returned it to me UNPUBLISHED! I think there
were two things working against me:

1) I'm a woman and WOMEN DON'T restore cars!!!

2) There weren't any nearly naked - fake titted
babes in the photographs!!!

When we did the professional photo shoot - the
photographer joked about NOT having any
credit card blonds with fake tits in the images - 
and I sugessted that HE put on a G string and hump
my bus... I mean ... afterall, it was resto-customized
by a WOMAN! 

:-)

We all got a kick out of the idea - but NEVER ONCE
thought that the lack of flesh in the shots would
keep Her Majesty out of the mag!

You show me ANY man's bus that cost $15K to
resto - put a beauty parlor babe next to it
and it's gonna get in Hot VWs - even without
an article written about it!!! But - let a lady
pull off a KILLER resto - submit quality
photos AND a nicely written article about it...
and SORRY! No flesh! You're outa-here!

Again... PHOOEY on HOT VWs!!!

Kath and Her Majesty - the bus that makes
people smile!!!
