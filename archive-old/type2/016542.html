Subject: Mexican engines/bodywork

Hello All,
Seems to me that a while back there was a mention of people driving into
mexico to have minor bodywork done. I would be curious to hear from
anyone that has done this and if their experience was good or bad. Any
recomendations for specific shops would be apreciated. It also occured
to me that one should be able to drive into mexico, buy and have
installed a brand new engine, and drive home. Has anyone done this? Here
in humbolt I dont face the gnarly nasty every other year smog
inspections that the rest of California goes through, and I dont think
on my 69 it matters anyway, so who would know?

It sounds too easy folks, so what am I missing?

70 Westy, the dog that followed me home.
