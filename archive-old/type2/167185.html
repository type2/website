Subject: RE: [T2] Running without oil

&gt; My wife ran our bus for almost 3 minutes without oil.

Top it with fresh oil and run it. It may have still been lubricated enough
during those 3 mins not to cause severe damage.

Fire it up and listen to what it tells you. And going forward don't have your
engine without oil longer than it takes to fill it back up again.

-Daniel
