Subject: Re: [T2] Diagnosis...Murder!!!

Laura,
Well, you can start off by checking your valves, just like you were 
going to adjust them.  If you find one that's waaaaay out of adjustment, 
you probably have a valve problem.  If you don't find anything wrong 
there, try a compression test, and that'll tell you which cylinder is 
the culprit.  I'd probably start with the valve because it's the least 
amount of potential &quot;banging&quot; that a compression test could do...

&gt; Does anyone know the order of diagnosing an engine problem.
&gt; Like how would you know if you burned a valve, or blew your transmission?
&gt; I've a 79 Westy FI automatic.
&gt; I tried taking it up to Yosemite. It was a hot day. I was downshifting on the 
&gt; hills. Lots of stress on the trans. and the engine.
&gt; Something broke.
&gt; There is a rattling noise when the engine turns over, and it does not start.
&gt; I'm not sure where to start trying to figure out what is wrong.
&gt; I suspect the head or the trans.
