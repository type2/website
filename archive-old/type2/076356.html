Subject: Re: [T2] After you get the CV's and axles off:

Guys,

I finally bought one of those &quot;cheesy&quot; looking bearing greasers
to try out.  You know, the ones that look like two small woks
mated to one another with a pressure fitting on one side.

When my son did his for his karman ghia, we tried the &quot;greaser&quot;.

We looked the bearing over closely afterward and I thought it looked
pretty well &quot;greased&quot;.  I think I paid all of $5.00 for it.

Just a thought.

Cheers, dave

&gt; &quot;CV grease is the only type of grease that will
&gt; work in this application as it does not migrate like other greases and will
&gt; not get thin under the heat and pressures that are generated.  Force the
&gt; grease all the way throught the CV by hand.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I haven't done quite as many CV joints as Rick, but I do have a nifty little 
&gt; trick for doing the actual greasing of CV joints.  Place your new (or 
&gt; absolutely clean old) CV on a piece of plastic wrap.  Just the usual kitchen 
&gt; variety plastic wrap (like Saran wrap).  You should have enough plastic wrap 
&gt; (about a foot of it) to completly bundle up the CV joint.  Then add a big 
&gt; dollop of moly (CV) grease and close up the plastic wrap around the CV joint. 
&gt;  Secure with a rubber band.  THEN work the grease through the joint.  You'll 
&gt; find that you can actually get &quot;pressure &quot; on the grease and force it into 
&gt; all the little cavities between the balls.  It makes for a much better job 
&gt; than doing it &quot;freehand&quot;.  What's more you keep your hands clean in the 
&gt; process.
