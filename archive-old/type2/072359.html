Subject: universal boots

I had a question for the list. I was under my bus (79 westy with a 73 
engine) today and I noticed that the universal boots are not secured 
on the drive shaft. Is that supposed closed off at the ends or open 
as they are. All four are open at the ends on the drive shaft.

thanks.
todd.
