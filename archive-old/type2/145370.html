Subject: longing for warmer weather

So here I am in Maine freezing my baguettes off.  The Green Monster is in the garage, where it has been sitting amongst empty beer bottles, trash, and a container of salt ice melter that is just far enough away from it so that it can't do any damage (I hope).  I don't have much to do today so I just went out there with the battery that I keep inside on the trickle, fired the bus up, and stared at it.  Which made my day.  I thought you guys could relate, perhaps, to this feeling - just counting down the days/weeks until it is safe (and warm enough!) to get the thing back on the road.  The best part about it is the explanation to the wife.

&quot;What are you  doing?!&quot;
&quot;I dunno.  Staring at it and listening to it, particularly that airbound lifter that is piquing my interest.&quot;
&quot;Why?  I can't imagine anything more boring.&quot;
&quot;Oh.  And you just got back from shoe shopping right?  I can't imagine anything more boring than THAT.  In fact, I'd rather have the neighbor come over and hop in the driver seat while I lie down in the driveway and have him drive back and forth over me than do what you just got through doing.&quot;
&quot;You'd let the neighbor drive the bus?&quot;
&quot;Well, you've got a point there.&quot;
