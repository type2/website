Subject: CV joint boot quality

i had gotten some of the boots made in Mexico and the USA...they each lasted 
like 100 miles before cracking apart...so now i put on the REAL German ones 
and they are perfect after a couple of thousand miles...the quality is very 
noticeable..the German rubber is like twice as thick and of a softer 
rubber...the others were almost like plastic....and the German ones come 
with new 12-point bolts and grease, too....just thought i'd mention this as 
it is a trauma to have to pull your axles three times in one month....get 
the German ones the first time..
