&gt; A 1776 with Kadrons.  Used to have an extractor on this  but I'm
&gt; disappointed with the noise and with the heat generated in this
part.  So I
&gt; am installing a stock muffler, hoping that it does not restrict the
Kadrons
&gt; too much.
&gt; 
&gt; With the Kadrons, there is no need for the heat riser tube so I had
planned
&gt; to cap off the flanges on the muffler where this tube usually goes.
&gt; 
&gt; I've read, perhaps in Hoover, that a stock engine depends on
circulation
&gt; through the heat riser tube to balance the exhaust flow and that, if
I do
&gt; cap off the flanges, I disturb this flow.
&gt; 
&gt; First question:  Is this lack of circulation something that we
should be
&gt; concerned with?
&gt; 
&gt; Secondly, if so, perhaps i should connect the two flanges with a
piece of
&gt; copper tubing, just to allow this flow.

The flow through this tube is quite low, driven only by the pressure
differential between the exhaust port and the muffler outlet.  I don't
think that it will make any difference if you simply cap off the
flanges.  Be sure to take care of the holes in the tin as well, as
they are a big cooling air leak past the hottest parts on the engine!
