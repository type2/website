&gt; Hi folks
&gt;  I just got into the Type 2 game, as I have bought a type 2 for a father&amp;son project. 
&gt; However, I got an oddball question from my insurance company
&gt; What was the original price of a type 2 bus?
&gt; Does anyone out there know?

I paid a little over $2100 for my 71 from a local dealer, however it was a
end of model year dealer demo so I got a good price
