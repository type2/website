Subject: A working gas gauge!!!!

Hello List.

I spent a good part of the day replacing my fuel tank sending unit. I did
it with the gas tank and engine in place. 

It wasn't nearly as bad as I expected it to be. I've heard so many
nightmares about this job.

A few friends of mine wanted a detailed how-t... now they
want me to do it for them :P

I posted it on my livejournal VW log.. i figured it might be helpful to
some people:

If anyone wants more detailed info shoot me an email: eddie_at_gacker_dot_com


For the first time i realize that the little E--1/4--1/2--3/4--4/4  gauge
actually has a purpose!
