&lt;&lt;Dear Volks,

My new '75 Westy has a metal box type of cover at the back over the rear 
hinges.  I've seen a structure with a wooden shelf in the same place in some 
deluxe Westy's.  Mine Westy does not have a side cabinet so this metal box 
goes completely from one side to the other.  Does anyone have a shelf 
available?  If so please pmail me.

Thanks, David Hunt&gt;&gt;

David,

I have the rear upper cabinet in my '74, which came off a '78 Westy.  It 
wasn't hard to install, you just line it up and drill the holes.

You didn't mention if you have a hard top or a poptop.  There is a 
difference.  The hard top rear cabinet is round at the top and the poptop 
rear cabinet is flat on the top.  Also, the upper cabinet is designed to meet 
up against the rear closet.  You may be able to center the upper  cabinet so 
it looks okay.  I will have to look at mine to see if this is possible.
