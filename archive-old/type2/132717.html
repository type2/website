Subject: Rotor

I checked the rotor today in my '70 westy (with 1600 stock engine) and the
sparking end is broken.  The metal is gone and there are several small chunks
of plastic missing at that end.  I wasnt the last person to drive it but the
person who drove it last said they had no problems?  What would cause this?  I
checked the valves and the point settings which were a couple of degrees high-
but nothing serious.

Thanks

Asaph
