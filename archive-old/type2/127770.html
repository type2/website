I was wondering about this when reading you post as well. Your cam
specs should have a max lift right? If you can find at what degree of
the cam that point occurs at (i.e. specs or cam supplier) you should
be able to measure it with a dial indicator on the valve adjuster on
one of the cyls correct? the rest could just be math. I'd get out some
graph paper and start sketching.
