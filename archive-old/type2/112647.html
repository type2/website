Subject: do i need an egr filter for my 76

    i've had my 76 bus since '97.  there is no egr filter, simply welded 
shut at the exaust y-pipe.  i've never been asked about this when tested 
for emissions nor has it been brought up by any mechanic.  i'll soon be 
replacing much of my exhaust and am wondering if it is important to have 
that egr filter.  looking at the archives i understand from searching 
the archives that some folks in california have trouble passing 
inspections without it but where that is not my case i would like to 
know if there is any importance in having it make the vehicle run properly.

    thanks,

    meb
