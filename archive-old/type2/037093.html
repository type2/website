&gt; Hello,
&gt; 	This is a serious and timely question to put on this list, especially when
&gt; gas prices are skyrocketing as they are these days.  Is there anyone out
&gt; there who has had experience with a T2 that has been converted to run on
&gt; propane or other natural gas?

Yes, Bob Hoover has experimented along this line.

  What does the conversion entail?

Lotsa work!  the big problem is getting heat to the vaporizer for the
propane.  Water-cooled cars use their cooling water for this, but I think
that Bob used engine oil.  Last I heard, he was switching to a Subaru
engine.  You also have to find a place to mount a big hefty propane tank,
where it is separated from the interior of the vehicle and vented to the
outside.  Not too easy to accomplish.

  Is the
&gt; mileage better or worse?

Worse if you use a stock engine.  You can use increased compression ratio
to regain some of this, but then you cannot go back to gasoline or use
dual fuel.  The heat value of propane is about 80% that of gasoline.

  Is it very cost prohibitive to make the
&gt; conversion?  Any warnings or cautions I should be aware of?  I was just
&gt; thinking that since propane in Oregon seems to be about $1.05 instead of
&gt; $1.60 a gallon, this might be something to consider in the long run.
&gt; 	Or, and this might be pushing it, how about a hybrid (gas, electric), pure
&gt; electric, or fuel cell set up?  Any thoughts?  What ever happened to that
&gt; holy-grail of a 100 MPG carbeurator I heard about years ago?

The 100MPG carburator is a myth.  The laws of thermodynamics won't allow
it.  Do a web search on &quot;Carnot Efficiency&quot; if you want to read more.

Any of these exotic setups might do you better, but consider what your
time is worth.  Figure 500 man hours to get a propane setup designed,
installed, and debugged.  At $10 an hour, this is an investment of $5000.
If you save $0.70 a gallon on fuel, then you'll have to burn 7100 gallons
before the break-even point is reached.  That's 140,000 miles!
