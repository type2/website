Subject: Brake Light ON and Brake lights not working

Hello All:
I finally got the engine from my '79 into the '77.
Got it running and everything seems fine with one exception.
Brake Light on the dash is ON, and the Brake lights aren't working.

Taillights, Blinkers and reverse lights work.  Checked and swapped
bulbs for good measure.

Any ideas, tips, advice?

As soon as I can get these brake lights working I can get started
working on getting my '79 on the road!

thanks-
Rob
'77 westy (almost sold)
'79 westy (needing my attention)
