    Well, I know I never used any sort of support for the tranny, and it
didn't sag much of any that I can recall. Not so with the '81 -- when I
pulled that engine, even tho I had a cable hooked under the tranny to
hold it, it didn't, and that sucker went almost to the ground. My '69
never did anything like that, and since I used two scissors jacks to
hold the engine, I always rolled the bus ahead off the engine. Sure wish
they had kept that removable rear section on the later bodys.
