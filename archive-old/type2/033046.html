&lt;&lt; Question: Anyone have a suggestion onto a high temp paint that I could 
  snag to recoat these things?
 
  I may even hit the heater boxes with the stuff as well. &gt;&gt;

the cheap route on this is to use high temp black bbq grill paint.  the boxes 
and/or exhaust components MUST BE COMPLETELY SANDED TO BARE METAL in order 
for it to work or last.  this means every nook and cranny, all welds, 
everything.  if you paint over the existing black paint they sprayed on it to 
ship it, your new high temp paint job will bubble and crack with in a few 
miles.  do it right and it will last forever.  

have fun
