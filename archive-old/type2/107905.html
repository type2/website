Subject: Re: [T2] do I need that thermostat?

Yes, it is best to have a working thermostat and flaps. Even in a warmer
climate it benifits the engine by warming up faster on start up. That is
unless you are somewhere that sees constant ambient temps above 85 degrees.
The longer it takes the engine to warm up the more wear to the engine. It
will also keep just the right temp. of air flowing around the oil cooler or
the heads by constantly adjusting the flaps (ie. coasting down a long
mountain pass in cooler weather). If you are worried about the thermostat
failing or the cable breaking it is designed to fail in the extended/flaps
open position. It is very important to get the flaps set up correctly when
installing them and make sure the spring is on the flap rod so if the cable
does break they will go to full open.

&gt; I'm thinking about doing away with it.  Any advice?
&gt; the louvers are naturally open to MAX air flow over
&gt; the heads and oil cooler, correct?
