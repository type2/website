Subject: Re: [T2] Shift Coupler

 
--I would consider it the coupler that connects the 2-piece shift rod that runs from below your shifter to the gear selector that comes out of your transmission.

Most say it, and the rear shift rod (rear 1/2 of the rod from the front) cannot be changed without dropping the tranny. Some say it can be done heroically. I am not a hero.

Cheap replacement part that should be installed new. Some say to tack weld it in two places, check archives for post on that. It is said to wear out and cause trouble. Good picture of it in the bentley.

If you plan to do it, read up on everything else you should do whilst you have the tranny out.

&gt;Hi I was wondering what exactly is a shift coupler?&gt;Todle
