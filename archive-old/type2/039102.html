Subject: Need Exhaust Advice....

Hello listers,

My '77 Westy is in need if a quality exhaust. I currently have an Empi
Monza style that has rusted to pieces in 7 months. I would like
something that is good quality, preferably stainless steel. It also must
be as quiet as possible, I did the no baffle stinger thing when I was
18. Can someone recommend a good system from heater boxes back?

By the way, we had a great time at Everybus 2k. What a great bunch of
people. Can't wait for High Country in July.
