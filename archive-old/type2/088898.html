Subject: Re: [T2] 79 f.i. loom

No, a Vanagon harness will not work on a 79 Cal only bus.
79 Cal is one-year-only. There is no injector resister pack. The resistance is
built it to the harness and ECU. The double relay is 9 pin instead of 11.
There is a O2 sensor but no 60-40 relay like on a Vanagon. The AFM is 79 Cal
only, ends with 022. Vanagon is 025. [there are other differences but no need
to list them, since it won't work....]

&gt; Hoping to reach Billy with this.
&gt; If your 82 Westy has an FI, try the wireloom from the 82.
&gt; I've got an extra 80-83 wireloom but I'm not sure it will fit a 79, I
&gt; know it will plug into a 78 AFM with 7 pins. They all pretty much use the
&gt; standard components like resistor, double relay, control head, temp
&gt; sender, thermo time switch and idle compensator valve.
