Joel,

As far as I know the molding is/was always held on by the metal clips. Thus
allowing the molding to be carefully pulled off. The tape you are describing
sounds like a PO, who never found a source for the clips, doing the next
best thing, this is how modern auto's do it. Looking at the door strips on
new Jetta's makes you appreciate the clips (they are always falling off).
FYI these clips are riveted and must be drilled out. Then they can be
reattached with a new rivet or a screw. We supply screws with the clips.

Subject: [T2] chrome body molding &amp; clips


hello again.  i asked earlier about a source for the chrome body molding
&amp; clips, but my next question is:

how do i get the chrome strips OFF the bus? i did manage to get one section
off, but it looked to be held on with double-stick tape instead of
the actual clip.  i dont want to damage them
when taking them off, but i really need to get under there &amp; clean all
that gunk.

TIA.
