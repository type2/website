Subject: oil leak
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

Been trying to fix the leaks from my push rod tubes for a long time. Pulled 
the engine to paint the tin, and while it was out i changed the push rod 
tubes and seals, now the right side no longer leaks, but the left side leaks 
worse then befor, im fairly sure thats where the oil is comeing from because 
i see a little under the push rod tube where they meat the head. I dident use 
any sealer, should i? Or should i just pull the tubes and change the seals 
again? Oh, 72 westy stock engine, as far as i know.....
