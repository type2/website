&lt;&lt; And another note, aren't most of the first in VW busses caused by old, 
cracked
fuel lines?  If you change your lines, what else would cause a fire?  just
curious?

Any number of electrical sources for fires back there. Loose wires shorting...
battery not bolted down, etc. Add some old spilled oil and you could have 
enough 
of a start to cook a fuel line and really BBQ your VW...
