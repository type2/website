Subject: Westy cigarette lighter

I've found another oddity with my westy.  Page 9 of the 1979 Campmobile
manual show the 120v electrical outlet. In my westy there is a what looks
like a cigarette lighter outlet to the left of the 120v and to the right of
the door flap under the rear seat.

It's wired to the back of the box behind the electrical outlet and it fits
adapters that go in the cigarette lighter in my wife's car but there's no
power coming from my slot.

Does anyone know if this only gets power from the electrical plug when you
connect at the campsite.  Is there a switch to connect it to the battery?
