Hi all,

Just spent an enjoyable week camping in Northumberland - Beadnell and
Kielder Water.  As a brief respite from wading through the digests (you
have been a chatty bunch) and cleaning the dead midges off the inside of
the pop top, I thought I'd compile a brief tyre report.  Note the use of
the Queen's English here, for the benefit of future archive retrievals I
will include the alternative [tire].

I have Michelin Agilis 61s all round now.  They have performed very well,
with minimal noise and very good handling in crosswinds.  Whereas before,
with incorrect front tyres, it was like sailing a yacht, with the wheel
held at a strange angle and gritting my teeth while passing trucks, now I
can almost let go of the wheel and still travel in a straight line.  It
really does make that much difference with the right tyres on.

We also did a few miles on rough forest tracks with no problems at all.
The tyres have a good chunky tread.  Coming back we drove in heavy rain and
a lot of the road was flooded, again no problems.  I will have to wait a
while to see what the snow performance is like :)
