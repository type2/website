&gt;I would make as few changes as possible to get it in tip top running 
&gt;shape. Adjust valves, leave the current dizzy, throw new points and 
&gt;condensor in...(gap points), change fuel filter, then time engine, then 
&gt;carb adjustment. It's take me time and pratice to get decent at the 
&gt;timing/carb adjustment thing, you might try to find a friend or someone to 
&gt;help if you can.

Well, that's what I'd do if I were smart.  But in examining the distributer 
the vaccuum cans didn't appear operational.  Well, at least the  on the 
back which I thought was the advance, but I'm not sure any more.

Anyway, I swapped the coil and distributer from the 68 into the 71.  This 
dist. has the Pertronix in it, which is why I moved the coil, too.  The 71 
had a red coil with no part number, no manufacturer, nothing.  So I didn't 
want to take any chances with the Pertronix.  I did a quick static timing 
and presto, good idle.

When I drove it, there was absolutely no power at all.  Checking back on 
the engine, I noticed the vaccuum advance fell off.  Hooked that back up, 
and voila!  Now, it doesn't feel as powerful as with the old coil/dist, but 
it's really smooth during acceleration, and it will hold an idle.  Now I've 
got to adjust the carb, and I should be good to go.

Oh, that and hook up some heat.  My feet are freezing!

PS.  You can curse me under your breath for being foolish, but at least I 
didn't install the 009 distributer that's laying in the parts bin :-)
