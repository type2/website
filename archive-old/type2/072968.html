Along these lines, what are the interchangeability between years? Is the 69
tranny mount the same as on my 73? Would that therefore be the same as on
the 74? (If so, I have a spare I pulled off a 70 because I thought the 69's
was missing but it's not.)

I'm going to be asking a lot of dumb 69 vs 73 interchangeability questions
in the near future. Just a heads-up.
