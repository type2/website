 &gt; Hey All,

 &gt;  My manuals haven't come in yet, and I was wondering what the best oil to use
 &gt; is for my '71 bus. I live in Hawaii and the temp is usually between 60-90F.
 &gt;
 
SAE 30wt is always good, and a heckuva lot easier to come by out on the
road than 40 or 50wt, although I understand that is changing.  FWIW, my
'73 beetle went a documented 450,000 on nothing but SAE30.  Only reason I
know this is because I knew the original owner AND his factory-trained VW
mechanic (my own personal guru).

FYI-  This beetle lived 90% of its life in TN, definately more temperate
than HI.  But the SAE 30 handled temps from 20F to 110F (changed every
2500-3000)with relative ease.  We were surprised to find many original
(well worn) parts in the engine at the 300,000 mile teardown.  I take this
as a sign of good maintenance along with good quality.

Good luck with your new bus.

Blake
