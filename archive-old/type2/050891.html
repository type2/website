Subject: [T2] 68 bus trans

Hi-

I've been working on getting a 68 crewcab up and running, and have a 
question for the list about the trans.  Mine won't go into first 
gear, so I had it removed, and sent to the shop.  The trans shop says 
that the 68 trans is unique, and for some reason less desirable than 
newer ones.  Whats up with that?

They are proposing replacing it with a 71 trans.  Anything wrong with 
the change?
