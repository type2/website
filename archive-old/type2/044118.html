walt-
what you need is one of 2 things. the first is called a push-button. it is a
button in your cab that activates your solenoid. i'm not sure how to do this,
but i do know how to do the second. hook a new wire with a
female spade to the ignition terminal on your solenoid., and wire it to your
battery.
turn the key in the on position and touch the wire to the + terminal. should
start it
everytime. it is most likely that the wiring is fried, and this will be your
best bet to solve that.

&gt; Hello Listers:
&gt;
&gt; I've checked the Type 2 archives, and I kinda know what to do next but some
&gt; hand-holding and reassurance from the list would be greatly appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; My wife and I took the '76 Campmobile camping at Ocean Shores, WA this
&gt; weekend and all was well until the trip home.  The bus started just fine
&gt; after packing up at our campsite.  We stopped for gasoline about 60 miles
&gt; into the return trip and, after fill-up, when I turned the key all we got
&gt; was a &quot;click&quot; from the starter.  A couple of dirt bikers gave us shove away
&gt; from the pumps and we bump started the engine.
&gt;
&gt; When we got home I checked the Bentley manual and performed the &quot;lights on&quot;
&gt; test.  The headlights go out when the starter switch is engaged.  I cleaned
&gt; the battery terminals (even put in a new battery) and still no go.  The
&gt; lights still go out when the switch is engaged.  Where do I go from here?
&gt; Perform the jumper wire test?  Whack the stater with a hammer?  Could it be
&gt; that the wires at the starter might be corroded?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for any and all suggestions.
&gt;
&gt; Best regards,
