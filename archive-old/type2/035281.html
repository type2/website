&gt;&gt; it and servicing the tank as above, hook it all back up, except the return

So it is, thanks David. 

Pretty much the same, except rebuild the carbs if the throttle shaft wear
is not excessive. If it is slop city there, consider shaft bushings
installation or converting to dual Webbers or the common progressive setup.
Put the fuel line from the pump into the container to flush it out. 

If you go with the progressive Webber system, be prepared to be an
engineering type while recording jet sizes and noting running test
observations as you will have to verify suitability of the out of the box
carb and make modifications sufficient for purpose, ie, clean idle with
efficient operation.

No fuel system running adjustments should be done prior to validating the
ignition system.

No ignition system adjustments should be done prior to validating the motor
system, ie, compression balance and adequacy and/or leakdown of cylinders
with valves adjusted at spec.
