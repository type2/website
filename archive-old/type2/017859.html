&gt;     A few questions:
&gt;       What is the conventional wisdom regarding the fiberglass scoops
&gt; that can be added to enhance the airflow to the engine?

The '68-'79 design incorporated a reshaping of the air intakes that
accomplishes the same purpose as the add-on scoops did on the earlier models. 
If your engine seals are in good shape, one shouldn't need the additional
airflow and resultant drag. (Besides, I don't know where you'd put 'em)
&gt; 
&gt;        Does anyone have the information about the rear shock with the
&gt; helper springs for the late 70's westy's to set the rear up without
&gt; having to go the the ordeal of resetting the torsion on the rear axle?

Conventional wisdom says that &quot;helper springs&quot; transfer a significant load to
the shock mounts which were NEVER designed to be a load carrying structure. 
Resetting the torsion bars is the only way to fix the problem without adding
more problems down the road.  
&gt; 
&gt;      Has anywone installed a front tire carrier on a 78 Westy?  How do
&gt; you get to the place to drill for the bolts that pass from the inside to
&gt; the outside?

My Riviera has a front spare carrier.  Rather than being bolted through the
nose ASI used a blind fastener similiar to a &quot;Riv-nut&quot;.  THat is, there is a
threaded insert in the nose rather than a nut on the inside.  If you are
asking where to place it, let me know and I'll measure the hole locations.
&gt; 
&gt;       What makes grown people go so crazy over these things.  My wife
&gt; and I are like we've had our first grandchild?

It's an old VW.  It NEEDS us.
