Subject: leak down and ring seating

Thanks to all who responded to my recent post concerning a failed leak down
test.

I mentioned that my tester draws a vacuum on the cylinder.  Responders were
unanimous in saying that the real way to do this is to pressurize the
cylinder.  Looks as though the money I spent buying this special MyTivac
gadget was wasted.

While on the subject, another piece of advice that was offered by everyone
concerned the need to wait until my rings have been seated.  I've heard
this often but have never quite understood what it means. Am I right in
assuming that the high spots on the rings get worn away when they scrape
the walls of the cylinders?

Jack
