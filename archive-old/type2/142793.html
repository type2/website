Subject: Re: [T2] Greetings &amp; Oil...

&gt; I'm just curious. I know folks say you will see oil leaks if you
&gt; switch to synthetic. Do some of you have first hand experience with
&gt; seeing this?  Or is this just rumor?

It's fact. Synthetic gets out places dino oil doesn't. Also, it
doesn't appear to &quot;scab&quot; (gunk up) at openings like dino oil does.

I ran 1000 miles with Castrol's synthetic blend and developed a leak
at the rear main seal that wasn't there before.

However, I think the benefits are worth the risk. After all, if the
synthetic found a hole, that hole would have soon enough started
letting dino oil out as well. Just a matter of &quot;when&quot;.
