Subject: VIN info for '70 Dormobile

Last week I purchased a 1970 Dormobile and I have been trying to 
decipher some of the info on the VIN plate behind the front seat.  
The bus is a bench seat with ambulance fans, ambulance step, and 
previously had a gas heater.  The front cab doors do not have 
vent windows (the only other one I have seen like this was on a 
'68 single cab).  The headliner is a perforated vinyl one, all 
other dormobiles I have seen had birch headliners, although this 
was probably replaced after one of the 2 engine compartment fires.  
The ignition switch also seems to have an accessory setting, which 
I have never seen in a bus this early (although I can't read the 
german markings on the switch to be sure).  The bus is Savanna 
Beige.

Anyway, here is the VIN plate info:

02 220 295
697
523331 D26 A67 507 517
23 2  7451  UC  2310  21

The first line = VIN #
The second line (697) is an m-code I don't know
The third line (523331?) (D26?) (A67?) 
507 = vent wings in cab doors?
517 = ? m-code
The fourth line:
23-2 = ???
7451 = ???
UC = delivery port
2310 = LHD Kombi
21 = ???

As a point of reference a friend of mine has a 1970 US spec 
Dormobile that was purchased in Italy by a serviceman and later 
shipped back to the US.  It's VIN reads:

02 223 701
119 121 191 500 506
523642 C01 026 094 103
24 1  7594  041  2310  21

First line = VIN #
The second line:
119 = Eberspacher stationary heater (gas heater)
121 = Ventilator, electrical (ambulance fans)
191 = ???
500 = Full width cab partition with 2 seater passenger seat
506 = with brake servo &amp; dual circuit brake warning light

The rest other than the model number are a mystery to me.

I would think that mine should have m-codes 119, 121, 500, and 
530 (ambulance step) on it.  Are there any of you later model guys 
out there (LiMBO perhaps) that could fill in some of the blanks on 
this info for me.  The only late model m-code info I have is a 1968 
Dealers Parts List.

Thanks for any light you can shed on this,

Dave
