Subject: re: John Muir Biography?

&gt;Does anyone know anything about John Muir, besides what is written in his
&gt;book?  I really enjoy reading his manual and would be like to find out
&gt;more about him, his background, how he got into all the VW stuff?  Maybe
&gt;someone out there has some first hand knowledge?
&gt;Of course maybe it is better if he remains a mystery?
&gt;Just Curious,
&gt;Brett

Maybe it's better if all of us remain a mystery.
