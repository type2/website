OK, let's just stick to procedure. Diagnose in this order. Mechanicals,
ignition, fuel.

Verify compression balance, don't assume.

Verify spark energy and timing, don't assume. You should get a bright
white/blue audible snap. If it's yellow and goes 'phuut' you got low spark
energy. Know that even new plugs subjected to multiple start attemps can
get loaded with gas and short out. You can check their insulation with a
good ohm meter. 

Only then can we assume the problem is fuel delivery. The pump and fuel
delivery system can only be validated with a pressure and volume test. Do
that before moving on to the ECU controled functions. Then validate the
relay with the Bentley test procedures.

The injectors receive their signal from the ECU. The ECU receives it's
power from the relay. If you are getting no voltage on/off to the
injectors, first verify that the pins to the ECU are getting voltage from
the relay and grounds. See the Bentley for the pinouts. 

Every assuption you make will attack your wallet until you get lucky. Don't
rely on luck. Rely only on Bentley procedures, in order, skipping no steps.

Other things to verify.

Voltage drop from Batt + to relay. Voltage drop from relay to pump. The
clicking you've been hearing is likely the relay. This makes me suspect
resistance in the wiring, either voltage feeds or grounds. The heart of the
system is the battery. Make sure the cables are clean and tight at both
ends of both the + and - cables. If you have the quicky fix clamp on
replacement terminals, replace the whole cable with a new one. If you see
any coorosion in the wires, replace them. Cut away the insulation for an
inch or so to inspect for this. 

In all cases, a low cost multi-meter can defeat any good procedure.
Inaccurate readings are as bad or worse than no readings in many cases. You
need to invest in a quality brand name digital meter, a Fluke or Beckman.
At retail, that means a minimum of $100US. On ebay, save a bunch. Get a
Fluke 78 or 88 and have accurate electrical readings for life.

Visually check the circuit boards inside the ECU. I have yet to see a bad
ECU that did not show evidence of board separation, coorosion and/or
evidence of overheated solder joints inside. You must use a 10X hand glass
and very bright light to inspect those connections. The usual areas of
concern are the components that draw the most amperage. Those are the
trisistors that are screwed to the heat sinks. Check those connection very
closely. If the insides are clean, pristine and looking good throughout it
indicates a 95%+ probablilty of no problem with the ECU, if it's a Bosch
ECU. If you have the DigiJet/Fant system with the Triumph/Adler ECU and you
decide to replace it, do spend the extra bucks on a Bosch replacement. They
cost more because they have much better isolation and protection circuitry
incorporated. All the solder connections should be bright. If they are dull
grey or show evidence of rosin bubbling it is not a good sign. If you see
little tiny balls of solder anywhere it is proof posative of bad news. 

Take the time to use pencil and paper to record all your steps and
measures. Pretend you are an engineer. Don't reinvent the wheel. Follow
procedures in order per Bentley. Don't ignore the opening paragraphs of
each section. 

That's the best I can do from 10+ time zones away.

&gt;Hi, Tim.
&gt;
&gt;Thank you for you input. I checked my fuelpump last night, and checked it 
&gt;agian and changed it to another one, it works fine.
&gt;
&gt;The old doublerelay is not burned, not on the terminals and not inside 
&gt;either. But something isnt working, I tried to see if there were any 
&gt;voltage on the injectors, but I cant get any reading. Not with a test light 
&gt;and not with a voltmeter.
&gt;
&gt;The double relay gives the injectors voltage, right? I worked on it utill 2 
&gt;pm last night when I gave up.
&gt;
&gt;Do you have any other thoughts our ideas? I am getting mad.
&gt;
&gt;Best Regards,
&gt;Nils

&gt;&gt;Verify if you have fried the new relay. Look for discoloration of the
&gt;&gt;terminals from excess heat. Take the cover off and look for overheated
&gt;&gt;solder joints inside. If this is the case, it is likely that the fuel pump
&gt;&gt;is old and drawing excess amps. Listen to the pump when running. It should
&gt;&gt;be a very smooth hum. Any noise at all is indication of a problem from age
&gt;&gt;and wear. Veryify the amperage draw. Poor ground or connections could cause
&gt;&gt;that relay to click on and off. Srutinize all the wiring from and to the
&gt;&gt;relay. Verify all the connections are clean and tight. Even a poor battery
&gt;&gt;cable terminal could be the culprit here. I have never seen a computer draw
&gt;&gt;the kind of amps that would kill a relay. But a funky relay sure as hell
&gt;&gt;could glitch a computer.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;This is just speculation on the info given. If you give up on solving this,
&gt;&gt;let me know your price and I may buy that sucker from you. I want a PU too
&gt;&gt;bad to be rational, not.

&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;I am new to the list. The reason a joined is because my ´82 FI Pickup is
&gt;&gt; &gt;not working properly, thought you guys might have some pointers for me.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;What can cause this, is something destroying my doublerelay? Can it be the
&gt;&gt; &gt;hole computerbox? Does any body have any Idea??
