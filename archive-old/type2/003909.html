7th Annual VW Fest

The perfect place for the last campout of the season!

EVENT:
7th Annual VW Fest at Graham Cave State Park near Danville, MO.
It will be held the second weekend in October - 13th, 14th, and 15th.

COST:
Camping is $7.00 per night for basic and $12.00 per night if you need
electric. The VW Fest Registration area will be in the basic camping
area. For a map of the campground. There will be a $5.00 registration
fee. This will get you registered for the door prizes and dash plaques
until they run out. You DO NOT have to have a VW to register. But you
must register to be eligible for door prizes.

Chili Cook-Off on Saturday. No fee to enter. Just make your special
chili and our volunteer judges will pick the winner.
Anyone with a spoon (or fork) can be a judge.

Danville is between St. Louis and Columbia, MO off of Hwy 70. Take the
Danville/ Montgomery City exit at mile marker 170. Go North and turn
West down the outer service road. This is actually Hwy TT. Go down
this road about 2 miles and it will dead end into the park. You can't
mess that up. Well, I'm sure Brian will get lost.

Octoberfest in Herman, MO
Around noon on Saturday we'll take a 20 mile scenic caravan to the
historic town of Hermann. Their World famous German festival is
&quot;Octoberfest&quot; and it is lots of fun. There are lots of activities,
including beer and wine tasting, and winery tours. It's fun for all.
