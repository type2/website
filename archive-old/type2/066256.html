Subject: PaintJobs

I painted my own bus. I didn't need a professional job; I just needed to
stop the rust. I painted inside and out. 

Costs included an air compressor ~$350, misc. air tools for body work ~200
(I borrowed a spray gun), and the paint ~150. I still have bumpers to do,
so I'll probably sink another $50-$75 into white paint.  If I had good
sense, I would have done more prep work on the body before painting, but
$$$ were running short. All the body work I did is noticeable. You can
stand 20 feet from the bus and see the imperfections if your eyeglass
prescription's still good.  The only awards it will win are the ones I
don't want...worst paint job...most noticeable bondo.

In my own defense, the bus looks 150 percent better than it did. I'm not
embarrassed to drive her to work or to show her to my friends...but I
didn't significantly increase the value of the bus either. Then again, I
don't have to worry about nicks and scratches cause I can paint over them
with what's left of my second gallon.

It took at least six weeks of all the nights and weekends I could steal
from my family (when it wasn't too wet) to get this job done and in truth,
I still have some more painting to do when I r&amp;r the windshield. I went
through the better part of two gallons of bondo (lots of it cut out and
replaced as I learned what I was doing wrong). I probably spent another
$50 in sanding disks and grinding wheels (and I was bargain shopping all
along. 

Figured my experiences were worth sharing for those grappling with
painting decisions. Maybe I'll keep getting better, but I don't expect to
ever put out show-quality paint jobs.

Thanks! Joe
