Subject: To Be Seen And Not Hit--( At Night )

Well, Sport Fans--
I have finally come up with the right cobo for the front parking light
lamps--and all of the rear lamps, on any 12 volt Bus--

The stock front bulbs are 5 / 24 watts---     (dual filiment bulbs )
I have 10 / 48 bulbs which work super well--and drop right in--
These are also the bulbs that I used for the rear tail lamps and brake
light bulbs--
Look out---They can see you now !!

The turn signal and back up lamp situation has also been solved--with 50
watt bulbs--
The won't effect the lene's at all--simply because they aren't on long
enough to put anything into nulear meltdown--and are also a direct drop
in item--

If your at all curious, or interested in a set-or partial set--drop me a
line--

Take Care--
