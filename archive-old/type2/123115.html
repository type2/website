yup same area, although most of the part you are talking about appear to
be rt 50  

&gt; I drove to West Virginia taking that road, from I-95 (up from Florida).
&gt; Grandparents own a cabin out in the middle of literally no where. I took
&gt; a 2002 Crown Vic through those roads and I must say, I don't know if a
&gt; Transporter can handle those mountain roads without blowing up the
&gt; engine! Maybe I'm just not schooled enough in the temperature changes and
&gt; hot spots of a VW Flat-4, but it seems about half the time, both ways,

yup a bus will do it, at least my 78 auto tranny does it in the winter
when I ski up at Timberline...

&gt; the automatic kept down-shifting, I had to brake constantly... it would
&gt; be a road better suited for a Pontiac Fiero, or a Porsche or something.

up and down, up and down, thru Romney and other scenic beautiful places
to the Black River area....
