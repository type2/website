Volks:

Driving a bunch of guys to the Reds vs. Cardinals game
on Tuesday night, going up one of the 28 hills into
Cincinnati my bus lost power and suddenly was puking a
huge cloud of oil smoke out the back.  After hoping it
was something minor, trying to assure my friends that
we would be okay, and filling the oil up, I started the
bus; huge cloud of smoke again.  Five miles down the
road the oil light flickered on- I knew I was hosed.  I
pulled off into a gas station.  My friends, anxious to
get to the game, jumped in a cab and left me at a BP
station in a bad neighborhood.  I poured some more oil
in, and was unable to see a valve cover or pushrod tube
leaking decided to limp down the road to the stadium. 
I missed the exit; and was on the bridge into Kentucky
with oil light on.  I pulled off as soon as possible,
and thought, I need to call Ted Finesman.  I looked in
the phone book, and this man who knew me only through
the list and some hanging out at BBTA, and who only had
two questions: where was I, and what did I need. While
I was standing there, 3 different people came up to me
and asked if I needed some gas money, if I needed to
use their cell phones, or if they could take me somewhere.
 Ted picked me up, we tried to limp to his shop, but
after the oil light came on, I decided to park it and
use the auto club (boy have those guys lost money on me
this year!).  The problem was one of timing; I needed
to get to the ballpark and get my friends, or they
would never know what happened or where I was.  We left
the bus for the towtruck, raced down to the stadium,
and made it in the bottom of the 8th.  They were pretty
happy to see me- we hopped in Ted's bus, and went to
his shop where he told me (!) he'd be glad to lend us a
car to drive home in.  
My friends had two experiences they will never forget-6
of us riding home in Ted's 2-door VW fox (the lightest
of us at 210lbs) for the 3 hour drive home, and the
experience of the power of friendship driving these old
busses inspires.  Picture this scene- Ted, with no
guarantees, hands me the keys to his car and trusts
that I will take care of it, and bring it back when he
needs it.  He also has given me a place to park my bus
until I can get a new engine into it. Oh, yeah, he also
gave me an engine to replace my blown one (more about
that in a minute). All I can say is these two things:
thank you Ted; from the bottom of my being. And this: I
live in Bloomington, Indiana. And thanks to my brother
in law Brooks, who followed me down to Cincy today
(despite having his back against the wall in a work
project) and will drive down there again to install the
engine. If you are ever in this area, (or Columbus, or
Indianapolis, or Terre Haute) and you need help, call
me.  My home number is 812-857-6769.  I will come get
you.  

Okay: on to the engine.  This came from at least a '74
Beetle (it has an alternator) and had a fuel line fire.
 It appears (beyond the air cleaner which melted on the
carb, and the distributer melted) appears to be just
fine.  In order to put this into my bus, what will I
need to do?  I know these issues exist: it had an
Autotrans, so the fly wheel and gland nut will have to
be changed (and the clutch has to match the '71
tranny).  But, beyond that, and the tin which needs to
be changed, what will having an alternator instead of a
generator mean to wiring?  What issues involving the
moustache bar arise?  What advice do you have regarding
rehabbing the engine before Brooks and I drive to Cincy?
Thanks for reading this far, and TIA for the advice.
Best, 
Dan
