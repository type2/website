Subject: Re: [T2] R profile key blank

Based on info I have, Air Speed and CIP1 are separate companies, owned by
two different people, but it's possible they work closely together in buying
product or it could even be a walk-in front for CIP1.  Air Speed has never
bought anything from VWG since we mailed them catalogs about six months ago.


In regards to the keys both companies offer, they are the typical
nickel-alloy with a chrome finish and I know for a fact they are not
original steel German keys, despite what their ad-copy says.  VWG/Airhead
parts carries the same keys (we don't carry the R however) and they are a
decent repro with the logo done in Mexico and brought in by a locksmith &amp; VW
enthusiast in Texas.  I code-cut keys all the time here for KGPR/Airhead
customers using these blanks I have used the K series in a 68 Bug and the M
series in my 73 Ghia.  KGPR/VWG makes the SG series key supplied to CIP1 out
of the nickel-alloy material, which I code cut on occasion.

Although I am capable (and have been capable for over 25 years) of code
cutting almost any key like Steve Sandlin does for the Bus, Vanagon and
WetWesties (http://www.steveslockshop_dot_com/), I've never really advertised as
such, usually re-keying used locks I pick up and sell from time to time.

&gt; I think it's the same company, same part.
