Hi Volks,

This spring through summer, I put 3900 miles on my 1978 VW champagne
edition Westfalia with automatic transmission.  Mostly freeway miles with
some unmeasured fraction of stop and go street miles and some offroad
miles too. I'd guess maybe 90% freeway miles, mostly driven at 65-68 mph.
Tires are 185R14C. I put 22 tanks (256 gallons) of 87 octane gas in my
bus. Eight brands. I noted mileage. When I was done, I did some
statistics. Here's what I found: 

Overall mean gas mileage was 16.0 miles per gallon. Standard deviation was
1.32. No doubt the mean would have been higher if I had driven 55 mpg the 
whole way, but I was in a hurry. 

I discovered that my tires were underinflated at one point about
midseason. I added two new rear tires at that time and corrected tire
pressure all around to factory specs of 32psi front, 44psi rear. Average
mileage on underinflated tires was 15.5 mpg, st dev = 1.45. Average
mileage on properly inflated tires was 16.9 mpg, st dev = 0.81. A
one-tailed student's T-test of my two sets of mileage measurements
produced a p-value of 0.0129. In other words, the difference was (in a
statistical sense) highly significant. Yes, folks, proper tire pressure
may make nearly 1.5 mpg (=10%) difference in gas mileage. 

I passed a CA smog test in the middle of my field season and leaned out the
fuel mix a little in so doing. To my surprise, this produced no
discernible change in gas mileage. 

I sorted my data by brand of gas and performed t-tests of gas mileage with
various brands against the group mean. I had between 2 and 4 data points
for each of several brands. I found no statistically discernible
difference between performance with different brands, but I had fairly low
numbers of samples .  Here are the number of replications (n), means and
standard deviations nonetheless: 

brand     n   mean gas mileage   standard deviation
chevron   2     16.5                          0.851
citgo	  2     16.4                          2.578
shell     2     15.6                          0.506
texaco	  4     15.5                          1.142
union 76  4     16.4                          0.985
mobil	  3     14.9                          1.715		

overall  19     16.0                          1.32

So there it is, for what it's worth. Your actual mileage may vary. 

Yours in science,
