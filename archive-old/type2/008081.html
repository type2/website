Hey Y'all,
  I have several things that I am getting rid of.
I have an original Jack and lug wrench. someone asked me for one about a 
week ago, but I didn't have one then, now I have three.

The little table that goes on the sink/frige cabinet in a Westy its 
about 10in x 14in(just a guess I don't have it in front of me). Its got 
the hinges and half of the support bar. Its in good condition.

Roof rack for Bus. this is two peices that attach to the drip rail, like 
for carring a boat/canno or long lumber

Make me an offer on the above things.

73 Sunroof Bus Auto trans 2.0L dual carbs. great body no rust, blue with 
white top. needs headliner and middle seat. would make great 
Westy/camper convertion $700
