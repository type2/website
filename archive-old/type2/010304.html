Maybe you could try Euro-American RV Products (formely known as DeltaSix 
Industries) at the following address:

2506 Douglas Dam Rd,
Sevierville, Tenn 37876

(423) 908-9384    Fax: (423) 908-8132

Saw on their pub 3 kind of water connectors and city and tank water fillers. Seems 
they carry and manufacture original equipment for VW bus and Van/Westfalia camper.

If you want a copie of the concerned page I can pmail it to you.

Hope this help...



&gt; 
&gt; ... water port has a check valve built in to prevent water from the
&gt; tank from coming back out.
