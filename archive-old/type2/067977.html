Subject: Re: VW sighting in Patagonia catalog

&gt;Another Friday bit 'o' fluff.
&gt;
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;I found a weird one in an older Patagonia catalog the other day. People
&gt;who buy Patagonia clothing take pictures of themselves doing cool stuff
&gt;like climbing mountains and roping horses. &lt;snip&gt; a young guy pulling the
engine
&gt;from a '71 bus. The caption said something about changing the front seal
&gt;and gland nut. It also mentioned that he's wearing the plaid wool shirt
&gt;advertised on the same page.
&gt;
&gt;The price of the shirt is about $50.
&gt;
&gt;That must be one very clean engine!
&gt;
&gt;

 Bit of trivia on Patagonia, they are kind the &quot;Porsche&quot; of outdoor
clothing.

 I can't afford but damn they are nice.

 Environmental consciousness: They make a sweater out of re-processed
2 liter plastic pop containers.

 It costs a bit more than if they made from just synthetic material
but they felt we should recycle.

 Hear it's a hit .
