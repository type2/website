Subject: RE: [T2] 78 starter

I don't have to jack up my bus or remove the wheel to remove the starter.
Might be a little easier.
Unhook the battery FIRST. Then unhook all the wires (maybe label them).
There are two big nuts, one on the starter, the other inside the engine
compartment at the firewall. The starter pulls right out, taking the long
bolt to the engine compartment with it. Then you can remove the solenoid and
get a new one. I think FLAPS is pretty pricey, but check the online VW
vendors I think they're cheaper, and may have a better product. If I recall
the solenoid has flathead screws that are hard to get off, but it can be
done. The only trick to re-instaling the starter is to get someone to hold
the long bolt (so it doesn't spin) on the starter end while you tighten the
nut in the engine compartment. Or hold it place with something really
sticky.

&lt;SNIP&gt;
So on my recent trip to the East Coast I had starter issues.  Once my bus
got
hot and I turned it off it wouldn't start unless I tapped on the solenoid.
So
I would crawl around underneath with a small hammer and tap tap tap - then
it
would start right up.

I'm hoping that I can jack up my bus and pull off the rear wheel and pull my
starter without pulling the motor (My new Bentley seems to imply that this
is
possible.)  So ... is it possible to buy a new solenoid?  Is it possible to
just clean up my old one and reinstall it?  Is it possible to even pull off
the old solenoid from the starter.  My starter and solenoid only have like
.... 65,000 miles on them but that are 25 years old -
