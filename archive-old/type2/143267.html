Subject: Quick summary of the GWB this weekend...

Pulled off exhaust, carbs, tin, fan shroud, etc. Just to see how difficult
it would be to remove the heads with the engine still bolted up. Looks like
lots'o'room to me!


Realized I didn't have a cylinder hone. Pep Boys run. Picked up a set of
strap wrenches too. You know the ones Bob Vila pitches for Craftsman? Worked
OUTSTANDING on the pushrod tubes!

Troy pulled the heads. Easier to lower them down than pull them up. Cool.
Pulled the cylinders off as well.

Discovered my 2.0 is a 1.8. (93mm instead of 94mm.) ARRRGGHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!
Once again I have the wrong parts, this time piston rings. I can't win...

Honed the cylinders and checked the gap on one of the old rings. Well within
Bentley specs. Ok, we'll reuse 'em then assuming all are as good. Check the
two right side cylinder rings, excellent.

Had fun with welding. I had picked up a cheapie $80 arc welder to weld nuts
to the chewed up studs on my heads. After hours of screwing around, starting
a fire (FIRE EXTINGUISHERS ROCK!!!), and generally having a bad time, I gave
up for the night.

Next morning I realize the rod I was sold with the welder was too thick for
its low current (120 volts, 70 amps). That's why I was having trouble. But
the clamp on the thing is too sloppy for the tiny rods that came with the
welder. I ended up folding the clamp end of the skinny rods in half to give
the clamp something to bite onto. Suddenly the welder worked like a champ!
My skills aren't as rusty as I had thought. Studs out. Ugly as sin though.
heh

Start cleaning and inspecting the heads. The intake valve on the #1 cylinder
is slightly recessed. I didn't drive enough on this head to notice any
issues at adjustment time, so we'll see if it happens to stay. I'm getting
fresh heads for the 79 engine anyway to replace the square port ones, so
hopefully it'll hang on for a few months.

Lapped the cylinders to the heads. The 3/4 head had gaskets in it. (Which is
scary since the 1/2 head didn't when I first pulled it last summer.) One
gasket was deformed and a piece was missing. Minor scoring inside the
cylinder and head combustion chamber. I had noticed the scoring while
honing, but the hone took care of the marks. Nice thing about the Victor
Reinz gasket sets is it comes with shims to use at the bottoms of the jugs
if the gaskets at the tops arent used to keep the compression the same.
Classy.

Loosely assembled the 1/2 side heads and cylinders. This was the only
painful part of working with the engine in the car. Trying to use that sheet
metal ring compressor is hard with the engine in the bus. Added at least 3
minutes to the job. ;-)

Started on the 3/4 side, went to verify the ring gaps and discovered that
one of the rings is snapped! ARRRGGGHHHH!!!!!!

So that's where I stand now. I need to order some 1800 piston rings. I need
to tear down the 1/2 side again to do it (I'm not gonna replace only one
cylinder's worth).

Another thing I noticed: The black ring on my Pertronix is cracked. I'm
going to see if they'll sell just that magnet ring...
