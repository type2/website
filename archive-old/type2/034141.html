&gt;Volks,
&gt;
&gt;  I dont have a tach and was wondering on my 72 poptop pancake, what is my
&gt;rpm in relation to speed in each gear. As in, when should I go from 2-3rd and
&gt;3rd to 4th what speed is a good shift speed and where is my rpm at that time
&gt;on a 1800??? We have lots of long tall hills in CO  and I would think Ill
&gt;need to climb in 3rd maybe 2nd, where would be a safe long 3rd and 2nd
&gt;climbing speed\rpm.

Assuming your speedometer is accurate (and that's a big IF based on the
'72's I've had experience with), here's what I do:

Fast hill-climb speed in 3rd: 45mph (~4100rpm).
Leisurely hill-climb speed in 3rd: 40mph.  Easiest on the engine IMO.
Minimum hill-climb speed in 3rd: 35mph.  Lower than that and I slow down
and grab 2nd so as not to lug the engine.

When I'm pulling hills, I upshift from 2-3 at 30mph and 3-4 at 50mph
(~4400rpm).  If I have to pull a hill in 2nd, I keep it at 25-28mph.
