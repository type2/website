Subject: RE: Other engines for Veedub and mazada rotary

Forget the Mazda rotary in a Bus, it'll fit very very easily but it's not a
torquey motor down low (Revs to about 10,000rpm) and not the most economical
around.  They're fine in a light weight like a Bug and the ones I've seen
are real sleepers and go like a rocket, but in a bus, you'd do some serious
clutch slipping to get it off the mark.  Now the SVX motor is another thing
altogether, great engine tonnes of horsepower and a lot of torque down low
as well.  Not sure if you can flip the ring gear but I'd be concerned about
loading the transaxle backwards with a lot of power, aren't most
transaxles/gearboxes designed to cope with higher stresses running forward,
in saying that though a subaru box should cope Ok, after all I'm running a
VW box (heavily modified) in front of a 230hp V8 in my Bus and after 2years
of work it's still fine (can't say the same for the clutch though)

Anyway, wanna checkout more conversions go to my Wild VW site at

I've never seen a Mazda in a bus, but there have been a few bug
conversions.  If it can be done in a bus it would be a snap in a bus.

I'm currently looking at the Subaru SVX 6-cylinder.  I am trying to figure
out if the Subaru tranny can have its ring gear flipped like a VW's for
bus use.  This would give a nice 5-speed transmission with the ratios to
match the power!
