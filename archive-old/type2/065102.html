Weston asks if the faded plastic trim that fits in the window rubber can
be removed without the windows' falling out.  I have pulled out all of my
plastic trim, except I think the back window, without any problem.  The
one thing you cannot do is put anything (old trim or new) back INto the
window rubber without taking out and reinstalling the whole window.
