Subject: Re: [T2] 76 - 79 car cover on a 71


Chris,

There are lots of little differences over range of 68 to 79 but none 
that should affect how a car cover fits. Radios and antennas were not 
installed at the factory and there are several variations on what and 
where they were installed. Spare tires were not mounted in the front 
at the VW or Westfalia factory accept some Euro only late model 
buses. So it really comes down to camper vs non-camper. As long as 
the car cover in a little taller to make up for the extra height of a 
Westy 68 to 79 North American versions should be the same.

Happy Motoring
Chris

&gt;I am not aware of any MAJOR differences in the body size for bays from 1969
&gt;to 1979.  If I send this one back, and get another one specific for my model
&gt;year, will I notice any difference?  Is it worth the shipping and the wait?
