Subject: Re: [T2] Emblems

Don,

They **have** to be draconian....it is up to the copyright holder
to(in legal parlance)  

&quot;vigorously defend&quot; their copyright...otherwise it falls in to the public 
domain.

We had this discussion over on the vintage vw list several years ago when 
the VWOA lawyers(fired now) went after a guy who made a clock out of one 
of his hubcaps and sold it on ebarf....they went after him with a 
vengeance, but in my estimation, hadn't a candle's chance in hell.._dot_cause 
they guy took the hubcap off of his properly purchased vehicle.

They **will** go after people making *any* repro's with the vw logo on 
them.  They lost an $80,000 sale at the local dealer cause they went
after a guy's wife that live just up the road from me....because she hand 
painted a splity on a coffe cup and sold it at a show.  The $80,000 was 
for an already ordered NEW vangon and NEW beetle.  The dealer lost the 
sale because these folks got a letter from VWOA lawyers about the coffee
cup sale.

I don't condone this and the lawyers at that time have since been fired by 
VWOA....and hopefully replaced by some that are little more intelligent.

Bus content: the vw emblem on my bus came from the factory&lt;grin&gt;.

Cheers, dave

&gt; You know, it really ticks me off how draconian they are about their
&gt; stupid logo. If it's not being used in a way that dilutes their image
&gt; or reputation, I don't see the harm in allowing enthusiasts to use
&gt; it..
&gt; 
&gt; I applied months ago to be allowed to use their logo on Great White's
&gt; site and have never had a response. Not a yes, not a no. Nothing.
