Subject: Re: [T2] cooling flaps

&gt; I live in San Francisco and there is no
&gt;reason to have it...
&gt;  
&gt;
Don't you go to Death Valley , Tahoe in winter  .... with your bus.
 From what I learn in the list, you need a thermostat where ever you 
are, If you need one , I found  one in Tassi (www.tassiinc_dot_com)  in 
Colma  (5 min from SF)
I convince Tassi's mechanic to keep them , they were trowing them away 
!!! :-(

&gt;Which way does the spring pull the lever that attaches to the flaps?
&gt;I read that this is a &quot;fail safe&quot; system, and if the thermostat is
&gt;broken (or missing), the flaps get pulled to the &quot;safe&quot; position...
&gt;  
&gt;
The flaps are in an open position (the air flow tru the oil cooler ) by 
default , if you engine is  out , look how the flaps works
