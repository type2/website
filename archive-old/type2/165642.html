&gt; Spent a half hour perusing the type2 archives, but no real names came up
&gt; for a cheap GPS to throw into the van's glove box. I don't need anything
&gt; fancy, just a hand held that will plot waypoints on the screen so I can go
&gt; around the old logging roads here on Vancouver Island. Anyone used a GPS
&gt; that is dead simple and plots waypoints and draws the maps on it's screen?
&gt; Logging roads have a habit of turning here &amp; there, and forking off in all
&gt; kinds of places. I figure a simple GPS would make this more fun, than hair
&gt; raising. :-) I see tons of them on Eb** but a specific model and brand from
&gt; someone who's used it would be awesome.
&gt; Thanks,

This isn't really a &quot;dead simple&quot; solution, but it worked really well for me 
when I went out exploring back country roads:

I have a little Gamin E-Trex Legend that I use for hiking. I fabricated a 
laptop stand for in my bus and plug the Garmin into my laptop. I run a 
program called GPSdrive (in Linux) and I can see exactly where I am on my 
laptop screen.
