Yes, Thank You, Chris, for noting this.

And, may I add, for future surveys, and other Friday stuff, that it'd be
nice if it ended a little closer to Friday.   For us with slower computers.
ISP set-ups, etc, getting dozens of &quot;Friday &quot; type stuff as late as the
following Thursday can wear a bit thin.....
