Well, here's where they're sectioning in a lower windshield (but they're
cuting the A-pillars, it's sort of scary):

I have a couple more, these are things people sent me and I hope very much
they don't mind me re-posting them. There are a lot of people contemplating
nose replacement lately. These are in response to my query about replacing
the nose in a splitty but once I got to looking at it, much of this may
apply to a bay as well, but the flanges are turned 180 degrees the other
way in a bay. Modern coachwork. Let us commence. Mr. Roland Wilhelmy writes:

&gt;Here are my thoughts.  I think it is best to make your cuts on the
&gt;lines along the areas with tightest radius.  Of course you have to
&gt;make the cuts really carefully and allow extra metal so you can fit
&gt;pretty precisely, but it is easier to grind the welds to look well on
&gt;more curved surfaces than running through the flats.   You can do
&gt;sorta fake flanging by fitting for a butt weld and then first welding
&gt;in backing strips to support the inset panel.  These can range from
&gt;complete backing to just enough pieces to make it easy (huh!) to hold
&gt;the panel in place while you tack things together -- whatever suits
&gt;you.  And the welding of the strips can range from big tack welds to
&gt;full length beads, as you choose.  I am uneasy about trying to flange,
&gt;say, ten feet of edge.  If you do flange, you will be flanging the bus
&gt;metal, not the patch.  If you don't have the flange depth just right,
&gt;then you have to do a lot of filling of one side or the other of the
&gt;patch line, which is about as hard as butt welding it in the first
&gt;place.  And flanging is a lot easier on flat panels than on the middle
&gt;of a tightly bent line.
&gt;
&gt;One point in deciding where to put your seams is that you will be
&gt;really thankful if you can reach the back side of the seam lines from
&gt;inside the bus.  This is darn near impossible to arrange, at least
&gt;fully, but do think about this and do what you can.
&gt;
&gt;If you can rent a plasma cutting torch to trim out your bus' nose, I
&gt;say spend the money.  Cutting with a plasma torch is almost like
&gt;drawing a line with a magic marker, only there is a narrow little cut
&gt;where you &quot;draw&quot; instead of a black line.  Like with a marker, you use
&gt;a ruler or straight edge to make straight lines, and cut out patterns
&gt;in metal and wood to guide you on curved ones (or just cut inside the
&gt;line, freehand, and clean it up with grinders and files and shears).
&gt;I have a small 110 volt plasma torch and think it is the handiest
&gt;tools there is, next to a MIG welder.  Plasma torches need very modest
&gt;amounts of 50 psi compressed air, along with the 110 volt ac.  You can
&gt;cut painted metal with no problem, just be sure that what is behind
&gt;the panel you are cutting isn't going to catch fire.  It isn't nearly
&gt;as much flame and sparks as a gas cutting torch, but there is some,
&gt;more like with a grinder.
&gt;
&gt;If you decide to try flanging of some sort, I have a different sort of
&gt;flanger that I haven't gotten up the courage to use yet:  From
&gt;Eastwood, it makes just a small bend along the edge of the metal, deep
&gt;enough to let a MIG weld bead sink to almost flat in the V made where
&gt;the two edges come together.  This flanger is of the modified
&gt;Vicd-Grip plier type.  If you guys want to try it, I will lend you
&gt;mine with the understanding that you will return it to me when you are
&gt;finished with welding the nose.  (If it works well enough, you can get
&gt;your own).
&gt;
&gt;Most important, if you &quot;don't know what&quot; you're &quot;doing&quot; with a MIG
&gt;welder, plan to spend at least ten hours practicing on scrap VW sheet
&gt;metal, making the sort of welds you are  going to be doing on the
&gt;nose.  And have a good hand held grinder to finish off your work.
&gt;&quot;Flap wheels&quot; do a nice looking job, but they aren't cheap.  Start on
&gt;your bus after you are happy or at least satisfied with the look and
&gt;solidity of your work.  MIG welding isn't brain surgery, but a few
&gt;hours of practice where you can make some of the inevitable mistakes
&gt;all weldors make is a lot easier to take than having to repair messes
&gt;that didn't need to happen on your bus.  Besides, as you will find, it
&gt;is a lot easier to weld on horizontal surfaces than on the vertical
&gt;ones your bus will be offering you.  Learn on hunks of horizontal
&gt;sheet clamped together on a table.  Then practice a couple of welds
&gt;running across and up and down vertical sheets.  Then you will be
&gt;ready.

And Mr. Bob Hoover writes:

&gt;The best cut-off tool is an air-driven die-grinder mounting 1/16&quot; thick cut-
&gt;off disks.  Second-best is the standard 4&quot;  electrically powered hand-grinder
&gt;(about $20 at Harbor Freight -- disks are about half a buck each [ie carton of
&gt;10 is about five bucks, locally] ).  I've got four or five such grinders.
&gt;Keeps me from having to change disks/flappers as the work progresses.
&gt;
&gt;You can get 1/32&quot; thick disks for a die-grinder -- makes a truely elegant slit
&gt;in a steel panel... for about a foot.  Then you need a new disk.  Sixteenth-
&gt;inch thick, mebbe three feet per disk, depending on the thickness/hardness of
&gt;the stuff you're cutting.  (Oddly enough, harder stuff cuts faster.)
&gt;
&gt;The disks used on 4&quot; angle-grinders are about 3/16&quot; thick, last for as long as
&gt;you can keep them in contact with the metal (the head of the grinder gets in
&gt;the way) and are much less expensive than the diamond-hard Resinoid cut-off
&gt;wheels used with die-grinders.
&gt;
&gt;Saws are normally only used in areas you can't reach with a grinder, such as
&gt;slicing thru a 2x4 'C' section from the top --- grinder can only cut about 1&quot;
&gt;deep.  Blades are expensive.  Disks are cheap.
&gt;
&gt;If you've got the whole front-clip to play with, remove the entire nose skin
&gt;at the folded seams along each door pillar and the folded seam along the
&gt;bottom.  IF the wipers/windscreen are not rotted out, cut BELOW the level of
&gt;the wiper indentations, leaving at least half an inch for a flange.  (More is
&gt;better.  You can trim it later.)
&gt;
&gt;To cut the seam, you simply grind off the outer edge of the fold then GENTLY
&gt;go after the spot-welds with a sharp chisel.  This will result in local
&gt;deformation but in almost every case it will be OUTBOARD of the crease between
&gt;the seam and the body-panel itself.  You then dress this flange back to truth,
&gt;ragged or not.
&gt;
&gt;On the bus to receive the skin, you follow the same general procedure except
&gt;you cut away the skin INBOARD of the folded seam and go after the spots with
&gt;the EDGE of your grinder, LEAVING THE OUTER PART OF THE FOLD UNTOUCHED.
&gt;
&gt;What you'll end up with a lip on the edge of the fold.  If you will now grind
&gt;that flat you will see that have a flange to which you can spot-weld PLUS a
&gt;surviving 'factory' edge on the fold... with a gap between the donor panel and
&gt;the edge of the fold that will have to be filled, ideally with the migger but
&gt;schlock shops use Bondo, etc.
&gt;
&gt;The big advantage here is that you end up with flanged surfaces on which to
&gt;adjust the position/placement of the donor panel yet the visible, significant
&gt;flanges have retained their factory fold &amp; shape.  If you try to build this
&gt;flange back up by welding/grinding, you'll find yourself spending as much time
&gt;on that task alone as you spend on the rest of the job.  By retaining the edge
&gt;of the fold -- AND LEAVING IT ALONE -- you need only fill the gap.
&gt;
&gt;Positioning the skin is also much easier when you have 'factory' flanges on
&gt;three edges.  The joint under the nose will require trimming, then forming of
&gt;the flange, then trial fitting and perhaps more fitting -- flanging can
&gt;stretch the skin.
&gt;
&gt;The usual flange tool is pneumatic but manual and electric types are
&gt;available.  I use one of those attachments that chucks into a rivet gun.  It
&gt;forms a flange  half an inch long and .030 deep.  In use, you gotta lean into
&gt;the thing.  The flanger is just a high-speed hammer &amp; dies.  The flange won't
&gt;form itself -- the metal will just vibrate back &amp; forth.  It takes the
&gt;strength of your arm to make the flange 'appear'.  Once you get it started,
&gt;you simply walk the tool along the end.  It will guide on the cut-edge, so you
&gt;want that ground straight and cleaned up real nice. Once you have a good
&gt;flange, you fit the new panel to the flange by gently grinding it down until
&gt;the new panel fits neatly into the flange with a gap of about a sixteenth.
&gt;That is the space into which you will weld or apply filler if the flange is to
&gt;be spot-welded.  The edge of the fitted panel must also be clean and well
&gt;dressed.  If spot-welding, the resulting flange is often painted with weldable
&gt;primer.  After the repair is done, if the lower edge of the flange is
&gt;accessable, it's a good idea to seal it.  In hard-assed repairs, you weld it.
&gt;(Grendel's new driver-side full-length rocker-panel is welded both sides at
&gt;the top.)
&gt;
&gt;To secure a new  nose skin you start at the middle, top &amp; bottom, then work
&gt;toward the side seams.  You'll need about a zillion round-nose finger-type
&gt;vise-grips.
&gt;
&gt;Once you get things tacked, focus on NEVER letting the panel get overheated.
&gt;This is a bitch with gas -- you can't weld more than 3/4&quot; at a time then have
&gt;to move to another area.  With a migger, you can do about 2&quot; before you have
&gt;to let that section cool.  That means, doing about four weldments then waiting
&gt;until you can put your hand on the LAST one you did before going on.
&gt;
&gt;Spot-welding is the best way to secure the lower &amp; side flanges.  With clean
&gt;surfaces you can tack every 4&quot; or so, alternating, side to side, go back and
&gt;tack in between (ie, 2&quot; pitch) for about four tacks on one side before
&gt;alternating.  When it's tacked at 2&quot; pitch, take a break, let it cool, go back
&gt;with dolly &amp; hammer and dress-out any local distortion.  Then go back and put
&gt;a real 'keeper' between each of the previous spot-welds.  That gives you a 1&quot;
&gt;pitch and should result in a symmetrical, drum-tight installation.  Then comes
&gt;the gap-filling (or edge-welding), followed by a lot of flapper-wheel work.
&gt;
&gt;Don't try to polish-out all evidence of the spot-welds -- there are valid
&gt;applications for body-filler and this is one of them.  If you can afford to do
&gt;so, use the epoxy-based, metal-filled fillers (Eastwood, etc) rather than the
&gt;polyester-based, silica-filled fillers such as Bondo.  You'll need to use more
&gt;work to get the metal/epoxy filler smooth but you'll end up with a more
&gt;permanent surface.
&gt;
&gt;If you don't have a spot-welder, look into renting one or borrowing one.  They
&gt;run about $250 for a good one but you can often find them used for about half
&gt;that.  You should even consider buying one for the job, selling it after.
&gt;
&gt;The only secret to good spot-welding is clean surfaces, easy enough to achieve
&gt;with flapper wheels.  And clamps.  A lot of guys mistake their spot-welder as
&gt;a clamping fixture :-), fail to provide enough clamps to hold things together
&gt;while the welding is done.   Pay attention to the shape/condition of the
&gt;copper electrodes.  Polish them (gently!) as the job progresses.  If the seam
&gt;is well-clamped to either side of the target-spot, you won't need all that
&gt;much clamping pressure to get a perfect 'nugget'.  Although infinitely easier
&gt;than conventional welding, there is a learning curve involved with using a
&gt;spot-welder, as well as a bit of practice needed if you've not used one for a
&gt;while.  Making up some coupons from the old nose-metal will allow you to
&gt;practice.  Be sure to tear your test-welds apart.  The welded-together
&gt;'nugget' should not come apart -- the parent metal should tear first.
&gt;
&gt;The top seam, where you'll want to form a flange, will be mostly concealed
&gt;behind the dash.  Before doing a nose job it's a good idea to remove ALL
&gt;wiring from behind the dash.  The package tray, wipers and heater ducts should
&gt;also come away.
&gt;
&gt;Working with an entire skin you can put clamps on the edges.  This is often
&gt;all you need to bring your flanged-seam into alignment.  But you also have the
&gt;option of using wooden poles or other means of exerting pressure against the
&gt;back of the seam.  This is usually only needed in the center.  You may also
&gt;use clecos or sheet metal screws but if you're not familiar with the technique
&gt;-- or if you don't have enough clecos -- you can build in some ugly, ugly
&gt;bulges in an otherwise perfect seam.  Holes for clecos or screws are filled
&gt;later, either with gas or by backing-up the hole with a copper block and
&gt;hitting it with the migger.  The migger does best here.  Chamfer the hole --
&gt;make it bigger, with a decided taper -- so the heat gets to BOTH panels at the
&gt;same time.  Otherwise, they will heat/cool at different rates and you end up
&gt;with minor bulges that give the finished seam a slightly 'pillowed' look.
&gt;
&gt;Clamp.  Weld.  Cool.  Move on.
&gt;
&gt;As a general rule, the greater the mass of copper you use to back up a weld,
&gt;the less will be the heat distortion, risk of burn-thru, blow-out, etc.  But
&gt;the curveture of the panel dictates the size of the contacting surface (unless
&gt;you specially cast/shape your coppers).  For a bus nose the copper block is
&gt;going to be limited to  about an inch square.   The usual procedure is to
&gt;shape/dress raw copper stock then braze it to a steel rod.  Grip the rod with
&gt;vise-grips, etc, press firmly against the hole.  Working alone, it goes pretty
&gt;slow but sometimes that's good.
&gt;
&gt;Welding supply houses offer an assortment of commercially-made coppers.
&gt;
&gt;A lot of guys tackle a nose job without regard to what they're going to find
&gt;once the skin is off.  Often times, once the skin is off they find another
&gt;weeks-worth of work in the substrcuture.   There is a classic water-trap at
&gt;the foot of the panel (and a hell of a good source for road noise to get into
&gt;the cockpit).  It isn't a very good design.
&gt;
&gt;You'll also see (by the placement of the welds) that the heater-ducting was
&gt;installed before the nose skin went on.  You'll be doing things backwards so
&gt;plan how you're going to re-install the ducting... if you take them out.
&gt;(Some shops have the tooling/experience that allows them to leave them in,
&gt;work around them.)
&gt;
&gt;If you want to build-in a concealed compartment... with the nose skin off,
&gt;examine the 'well' at the bottom of the panel, between the supports for the
&gt;bumper.  (The trick here is that after removing the front belly pan -- and
&gt;finding nothing concealed above it, few inspectors extend their search to the
&gt;frame-rails or body panels that have been concealed by the belly pan.  Or, so
&gt;I've heard.
&gt;
&gt;I suggest you de-rust this area aggressively.  This is also  the ideal time to
&gt;deal with those nut-plates for the front belly-pan.  Once you've dealt with
&gt;the rust, flood the space with corroless or other thick-film anti-corrosion
&gt;paint.  Insert steel tubing for the electrical harness to pass through  and
&gt;put globs of RTV over the nut-plates then fill the void with high-density
&gt;urethane foam, the stuff you mix together and pour (check with a hobby shop.
&gt;Our local HOme Depot has started carrying it).  The anti-corrosion paint
&gt;should be allowed to dry for two or three days before you foam it.

These are very dense but they start to make a helluva lot of sense once
you've read them 10 or 12 times.

Also Rob King noted that &quot;new&quot; replacement noses are not designed wide
enough to do flanging/wraparound tricks, you have to get the wide noses
&gt;from a donor bus rather than a retail source.

If there is another good bay nose-replacement article on the web then
somebody please tell me where it is when you find it.
