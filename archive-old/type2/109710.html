&gt; And , if the bus is carbureted, do not put the fuel filter between the
&gt; fuel pump and the carb. The fuel filter goes under the bus between the
&gt; gas tank and the hard fuel line.
&gt; 
Uh oh, I have made this mistake with my '74 carburetted bus!  I also have a 
larger filter at the tank pick up.  Why is this a problem?  I am guessing it 
might restrict the flow of fuel to carbs? Thanks for the tip!
