Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Big Brake job Q's

Not sure if it's the best way or not, but my method is to loosen the parking brake cable all the way, then adjust the rear brakes (with new shoes), then tighten the parking brake cable.  I agree with Rick that doing the parking brake cables first would tend to preload the cable by causing the top of the shoes to contact the drum when you tighten the star adjusters.

&gt;Hmmm. If you have brand new pads, this would probably work ok. But if you

&gt;pre-tensioned the parking brake cables, maybe causing misalinged or
&gt;non-symetrical brake shoe geometry?
