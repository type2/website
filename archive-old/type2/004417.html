It's worth noting this outfit also sells Carbon Monoxide detectors, Gasoline
fume detectors, and Propane/CNG detectors.  These technologies were
developed and refined specifically for the marine environment [strictly
regulated by Federal DOT/Coast Guard regulations and specifications] by
Xintex while they were based in the Seattle-Tacoma WA area.

Xintex was subsequently acquired by FireBoy a few years ago to obtain access
to their advanced detector technology.

The table of Carbon Monoxide effects on this page &lt;
http://www.aetnaengineering_dot_com/cmd2m.html  &gt; is both informative and
sobering, especially now that we're all maximizing the output of our bus
heating systems.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  An idea I have been playing with is the engine compartment fire
extinguishers they sell in the marine catalogs. Looks like a regular fire
extinguisher with a sprinkler (as in fire control) head on it. They used to
be Halon and now they have some other gas in it. The sprinkler head has a
fusible link keeping it shut, I can't remember the melting point. Here's a
link of some with auto or both auto and manual discharge. I think they
started around $150 and up in the catalog I saw.
