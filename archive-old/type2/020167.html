Subject: Re: [F] The Kristin Laurite Fund, Inc (Murder)


This seems like a good cause. For those who are new, an young lady named
Kristin Laurite was murdered while traveling cross-country in a 71 bus
this summer. Her killer has not been apprehended. Stephen Gutknecht
maintains a web page with news about this:

	http://www.yourvw_dot_com/Kristin/

For every person who donates $30 or more to the Kristin Laurite Fund, we
are offering free type2_dot_com email forwarding; you can use the incredibly
prestigious address &lt;yourchoice_at_type2_dot_com&gt; as a return address, and all
mail sent to &lt;yourchoice_at_type2_dot_com&gt; will magically end up in your mailbox.

Okay, so maybe I'm overly optimistic about the prestige of a type2_dot_com
address, but note that I'm pretty good at spam filtering; donate
something over $30 and watch me make your spam disappear.

(No, I can't keep spam out of RAMVA. Cleaning newsgroups requires
forgery and I don't do forgery.) =^ )

Folks, please pony up, and let's put the psychopath who did this in a
cage where he can't hurt my daughters or yours.

&gt; 
&gt; This is a fund raising attempt, created by people who love Kristin (such as
&gt; her mother and uncle), to raise money to help her family pay for the huge
&gt; expenses this tragety has created. Besides funeral expenses and future legal
&gt; expenses,  attempts to apprehend the killer have been very expensive,
&gt; yet necessary.  Flyers have been hung throughout the country, 3 billboards
&gt; have been put up in Arkansas, and to run one article for one day in US News
&gt; costs $16,000.  Any donation amount is really appreciated.
&gt; The fund is a non-profit fund and donations are not tax deductable.
&gt; -All donations should be sent to...
&gt;                 The Kristin Laurite Fund, Inc.
&gt;                 P.O. Box 157
&gt;                 Fanwood, NJ 07023
&gt; -Any money left over, after the killer is found and apprehended, will be
&gt; donated to two charity organizations that Kristin would have been proud to
&gt; help out.  Kristin was very fond of both:  teaching chilren and dogs.  She
&gt; was a pre-school teacher for years and was the best dog owner I have ever
&gt; met.  Any remaining money, when there is closure, will be donated to...
&gt;     A.    The Seeing Eye:  An organization that breeds there own dogs and
&gt; trains people who then train these dogs.  The Seeing Eye then gives these
&gt;  dogs to blind people who could benefit from the help of the dogs, in
&gt; their daily life including blint teachers.  The Seeing Eye has been around
&gt; since 1929 and is located in Morristown, NJ
&gt;     B.    Saint Hubert's Animal Welfare Center:  An organization located in
&gt; Madison, NJ.  The donations will go specifically to the part of the
&gt; organization called Pet Partners/ Pet Therapy.  They use dogs to go to
&gt; children hospitols to lift up spirits, schools, girl/ boy scouts, pet
&gt; education....
&gt; 
&gt; Sincere Thanks in advance for all contributions,
&gt; Nicole (Best friends with Kristin since nursery school)
