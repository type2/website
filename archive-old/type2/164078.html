Subject: 34pict3 idle and wacky RPM readings

I've been having issues with tuning my carb.. I've got a 1600dp, 34pict3,
009 (yeah I know, I'm saving for svda/pertronix).
- points/dwell at .017/50
- timing 30 BTDC at full advance

Basically I have two problems I can't work out.

A)  I'm following the bentley idle instructions but the results aren't what
I expected:

1 - Connect tachometer and oil temp gauge and start engine.  CHECK
2 - Check oil temp is between 122 -158 F ,and shut down engine. CHECK
3 - Check that choke is open fully.  CHECK
4 - Carefully turn volume control screw in till it stops, then turn out 2
1/2 To 3 turns.  CHECK
5 - Start engine, make sure that choke is open again and reinstall air
cleaner. CHECK
6 - Set idle speed at 750-900RPM by the idle speed screw. I can't even
maintain an idle with the volume at 2 1/2 turns, 3 will chug for a bit
before dieing, no matter how far I adjust the idle speed screw...
7 - Turn out volume screw to highest idle speed and then turn back until RPM
drops by 20-30 RPM. Ok, so I leave the idle speed screw at about 3 1/2 turns
and start turning the volume screw, it will increase out to about 6 turns
(maybe 1100 rpm), then I drop it back a bit and I can set it to a proper
idle speed. Too much gas though, when I drop the accelerator at high rpm it
stalls right out. flooding right? So I tested the same at 3, 4 and 5 turns,
I brought it up to maybe 3200rpm and dropped the accelerator and it still
stalls right out. Any ideas?


B) I've got a nice Mac Tools automotive DMM with an inductive pickup that
I'm using to measure the rpms, the readout constantly jumps around by up to
200rpm with no audible change in engine speed. I tried all four plug wires
and got the same on each. I tested the meter on a new beetle and got rock
steady results (variation of 1 rpm), so it isn't the meter. What could be
causing this?

Thanks for any advice.
