&gt; ok guys, i have ordered my windshield here locally and

I hope you're not tall.  In my bus tint would drive me crazy because I'd
have to look through it!

 sounded like a good price to me.  i
&gt; have installed a flat bug windshield before and don't
&gt; think the bus will be that much different if it is
&gt; then tell me.

At least three times as heavy and a lot more awkward to handle.

  my question is that i will be taking it
&gt; back out in about a month, hopefull 2 weeks and i
&gt; wanted to know what was the best way to take it out
&gt; without ruining the seal?

If you try to save the seal you will probably break the glass.  Which is
more valuable to you?
