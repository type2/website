&gt; [...] Has anyone seen the article on Type 1 Air Suspension in the March

&gt; of the air suspension used on 18 wheelers for the type 1 bug.
&gt;  
&gt; Apparently it is fully adjustable from inside the vehicle, wheel by wheel or
&gt; any combination and can increase or lower height up to 4&quot; on the bug. I have
&gt; been meaning to call the company to see if they have the same type of setup
&gt; for the type II, or if they plan on it.
&gt; 
&gt; This does not replace the shocks, rather it takes over for the job of the
&gt; torsion bars. They say the ride is MUCH smoother and more stable than a
&gt; regularly sprung VW.

If these replace the torsion bars, what keeps the trailing arms in the
torsion housing?
