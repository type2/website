I'm sorry I don't have a spare right now George. I was kind of curious
when I pulled the engine from my 67 bus and noticed that the PO had run
the engine for about 20,000 miles with the fanbelt way out of alignment.
He had used a 38 amp generator (probably original to the bus), bus hub,
but standard backing plate.  I just so happened to have the correct
backing plate and so while it was off, I compared 2 hubs I had.  I wished
I had taken a picture of it to show the difference in sizes.

I wouldn't say it's any big deal if you shim the fan one way or the other.
As long as it has some bite on the shaft...
