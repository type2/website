Subject: Finding front brake drums??  '68
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hi all,

Looking through my catalogs, it seems that front brake drums for '68
busses seem to be scarce! I saw on bus depot's site that their front
drums work for '64 through '70. Is this correct?? In the catalogs I
have, I see that it says 64-67 is one type of drum with no mention of
the other years.

Thanks!

Jen
