Subject: Re: [T2] VW boat

&gt; &gt; Did you see the price of the VW Engines they sell for airboat use? Like,
&gt; &gt; $5000, aieee. Tom
&gt;
&gt;I understand that they do some mods for increased thrust, which would be a
&gt;great concern for airboat use.  They develop much greater thrust loads
&gt;than automotive or aircraft applications.
&gt;
&gt;Besides, the alternative engines for airboat use are Lycoming or
&gt;Continental aircraft engines.  The smallest rebuilt Lycoming goes for over
&gt;$15,000.  Against this background, $5000 is dirt cheap :)

There is always the Corvair engine too. $200 with $1500 rebuilds. Good 150K 
mile motor so it is durable.

And the best webpage of all (some of it quite applicable to the VW):

Since the engine is going on a watercraft - why not use a watercooled 
engine like a Subbieroo?
