&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; Anyone living near Newport News want to take a look
&gt; at a westy for me?
&gt; I'm in philly and would hate to make the trio if the
&gt; bus is not what the
&gt; guy says it is.  Please email me at airhead_at_acvw_dot_com
&gt;  if you would like
&gt; to help.  Thanks

  If the bus is on the road and the owner doesn't mind
driving about 100mi. to a really neat VW shop,boneyard
and parts store I would be happy to check it out at no
charge for a list member.                             
  Good luck  Wayne
