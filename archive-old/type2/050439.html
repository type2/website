Peanut butter works well.  Had a mouse in the kitchen.  Set a trap with a
blob of peanut butter on the trigger.  15 minutes after the light went out
SNAP!  No more mouse.

&gt; that supposedly won't smell.  Supposedly.

Well, the level of dehydration to cause death is still enought to allow
decay to take place.  I'd rather use a trap.  No smell, you are sure that
you caught something and it's more humane than poisoning.

BTW, if you use a trap, be sure to wear gloves and minimize contact with
the dead mouse.  Fleas and ticks will abandon the cooling mouse for nice
warm you and some of them carry very nasty diseases.
