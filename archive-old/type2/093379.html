Subject: Re: [T2] The new pertronix ignitor II, and the 009 problems

Actually, what I figured the manufacturer was saying was, as follows:

For the making and breaking of points closure there are 3 time values.
Time from max contacts separation to closure.
Actual time of contacts closure.
Time from closure to maximum contacts separation.
(cycle repeat)

Since the relationship of points travel time, as a function of actual 
points closure time might change with variable rotational speeds of the 
distributor, perhaps the manufacturer is just playing with words in their 
new advertising claims.

With the solid state module, this relationship would remain more closely 
constant,
but that would have always been the case with their product.
