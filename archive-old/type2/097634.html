&gt; Dave,
&gt; 
&gt; I did note your reference to the shock mount which is how and why I
&gt; found it.  Thanks for the tip.  Just wish your suggestion had not panned
&gt; out as I'm sure you can understand.
&gt; 
&gt; And I will get another shock while I'm waiting to get Kermit fixed.  I
&gt; get a smoking discount (two Napa CV boot kits and a shock for $30.  Not
&gt; bad) through work at several FLAPS so I'm going to take advantage of it.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the advice.

Duke-
Go out and find a really big pot-hole
( you know, the one that did the damage :) 
then get an estimate from the VW dealer
and forward your claim to the municipality.
Should be enough to buy a mig. 
Dave \X/
