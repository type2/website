Subject: SF to Angels Camp tomorrow?? vw show?

Hello,

Is anyone else from the list planning on heading out to the VW show in 
Angels Camp tomorrow? Possibly from the San Francisco area?

If so, wanna carabus out there? I would like to be up pretty early to head 
on out there, since it is about a 3 hour drive.
