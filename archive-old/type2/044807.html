Subject: [T2] Nusiance laws strike again

Hi all,

     Bloody nosy neighbors... My Mom is in San Diego, and has a '78 Westy 
(auto trans). It's not the prettiest car in the world anymore, and at the 
moment is in need of repair, for which the mechanic quoted $900 or so, 
which is more than she can currently afford. One of the local Mrs./Mr. 
Grundys has turned it in as an eyesore, so as of the 23rd she has 10 days 
to do something or it gets towed and scrapped. She doesn't want to sell 
it, but would rather it go to another home than get scrapped, which is 
what the law says will happen if it gets towed.

     So, does anybody have any ideas on how to deal with it? Advice on 
past encounters with the local city hall? One option would be to put it 
in her garage. Problem is, it won't fit as is, so she'd need to pull off 
the garage door to get it in. Which would obviously be problematic for a 
single woman...

     Alternatively, if it comes down to the line, she'd likely rather 
sell it than let it be scrapped. Her memory of the quoted repair is a 
head, but she doesn't swear to that. Anybody with good ideas or interest 
in buying it, drop me a line or mail Mom at &lt;tutu4enh_at_aol_dot_com&gt;.


Peace,
