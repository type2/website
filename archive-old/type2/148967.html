Subject: smokey the hot-air vent

Is it possible to clean the heat exchangers (1981 CA air-cooled 
vanagon)?  Preferably without removing the engine...

I know I had a warped valve cover on the right side, which was leaking 
oil, which ran down the exhaust manifolds and into the heat exchanger.  
I've since replaced the valve cover, and gooped up the edge of the heat 
exchanger tin with muffler cement. (though perhaps I missed a spot) But 
even after a few hundred miles (city driving, haven't had a chance to 
do any longer trips yet), there's still a bit of a smokey, burning-oil 
smell coming through with the hot air.  I tried adjusting the control 
box flaps, but no matter how loose the cables, they won't quite shut 
completely.  I disconnected and duct-taped up the hot air duct behind 
the grille, which stopped the smell, confirming its origin as somewhere 
in the hot air system, consistent with my hypothesis that it's oil 
burning off on the heat exchangers.

Anybody know, if it was, how long I should expect the smell to linger 
before all the spilled oil burns off?  It's possible I didn't goop up 
the edge with quite enough muffler cement, and that the new valve cover 
isn't sealing perfectly, leading to occasional additions of oil to the 
exchangers.  But I think it's sealed pretty good, and isn't using up 
much oil, compared to before (but again, I haven't driven it enough 
since the last oil change to put a number to oil consumption...)

I guess the obvious way would be to remove the exhaust system, pull the 
tin off, clean the insides, weld it back together, and re-install, but 
is there any product/ system/ service that could force something 
through them on the van (or maybe disconnected at the control boxes or 
somewhere) to clean them out easier than that?

Thanks,

Anton.
