&gt;&gt;&gt;In your note below, you mention something about the original Auxillary

Chris...I found this site the other day
http://www.type2_dot_com/rvanness/accessor.htm Look down towards the bottom of
the page.

I recently sent for some info on modern versions of these ebersbacher
heaters. They look great, some can heat water too! VERY expensive though.
For my VW is was running to around 700 UK quid adout $1000? ish.!!
