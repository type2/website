Subject: Darn VDO Metric vs. NPT

I hooked up my mechanical oil pressure gauge today but I couldn't get my VDO
hose to seal against the hole in the case. I was reluctant to tighten it up
since the stock sender seals so easily.

I read all the prior threads on this subject and I thought I understood it
but after ordering items apparently I do not. I thought my case had the
M10x1mm hole as was agreed upon but Hoover says it's 1/8&quot;-27 NPT. The sender
I pulled out was stamped 1/78 and my bus was built in 2/78 so it's probably
the original and was removed for the first time.

I know with 100% certainty that the FI temp sensor is M10x1 and it won't
thread into the hole. I have a tee adapter for a bug that has female M10x1
threads and neither the stock sender nor the VDO dual pole sender wants to
thread into it properly so why is it advertized as M10x1 (?3).

This is all what I have:

pg

What I can't figure out is the threads of hose labeled (?1). It's the same
on each end and I can identify the other thread as an AN fitting.

Has anyone else had this problem and identified these threads? VDO's tech
support was inept at best and now everything is closed for the holiday.
There only seen to be two threads advertized but they're all different
enough I can make them fit nicely. Is there something basic I just don't
understand?
