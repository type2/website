Subject: Re: [T2] re: Westy extinguisher size? Halon

My mistake... What Neale said. Chlorinated Fluorocarbon... Not hydrocarbon.

&gt; This is getting off topic, but the reason that Halon is no longer available
&gt; relates to the CFCs and the Ozone layer. Just as airconditioners have had to
&gt; change over to different gasses, so have extinguisher systems. IF you can
&gt; find a source for Halon gas, you can legally re-charge a Halon system, but
&gt; you can't install Halon systems anymore (FM200 is the best replacement), CO2
&gt; extinguishers are still fine, but you don't use CO2 for the dump systems
&gt; like Halon was used for. (Had to do this in an exam a couple of months back
