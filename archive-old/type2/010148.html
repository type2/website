Another quarter-baked idea. Get a senator from a non-auto producing state
(Arizona?) to sponsor a bill declaring a National Automobile Heritage Week
(ideally the same week as Jerome). Then talk franchises into honoring the
prices of goods and services that were in place the year that any given
automobile was produced over the course of that week. So for a '67 bus a
MacDonald's burger would be $0.15. Mobil gas for a '72 would be $.19 a
gallon. (The limitation would have to be that a given product or service
was actually available in the year in question, and still available now. I
can't remember when unleaded gas came along.)

Now if we could convince VWoA to sign on, it would be really interesting.
