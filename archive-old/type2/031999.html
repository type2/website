Subject: Rebuilt 2.0L engine runs!!! And a GEX surprise
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.OSF.3.91.990707103431.26537A-100000_at_Sherlock.SIMS.Berkeley.EDU&gt;

Hi all:

As you may or may not know, I've been slowly, slowly rebuiding a couple 
of air-cooled Vanagon engines.  I was doing this for reason I really can't 
explain because the  GEX rebuild that was in the car seemed to have been 
running just fine.

The &quot;slowly, slowly&quot; part got significanly accelerated when, about a week 
and a half ago, the GEX self-destructed by snapping off the head of the 
exhaust valve in number 1 cylinder.  Not a pretty sight.

Luckily, one of my rebuilds was almost to the point of &quot;turn key&quot; status, 
and I installed it in my Vanagon.  (After a couple of detours for new CV 
joints all the way around and all new seals in the transmission.)

I started the engine today and.... it ran!!!!  Yahoo!!!!  Gave it the 20 
minutes at 2,000 rpm, changed the oil and filter, so I'm almost ready for 
my first drive, after a check of timing, idle speed, and fuel mixture.

The GEX surprise is...  I emailed the President of GEX about my engine's 
self-destruct after only 28,000 well-cared for miles and he agreed to 
replace the destroyed parts and/or take the engine back for repair!!!!!  
I haven't done anything about this yet since I've been busy, and I'm not 
yet sure what I'll do, but after all the GEX-bashing that's gone on I was 
surprised, to say the least, at GEX's response.

I'll let you know how this all works out.
