Subject: Re: [T2] 2.0 L engine-1.8 L heads

Hi Phil,

I went through valve and seat issues last year with the Westfakia's 
engine, and wound up migrating to a hybrid 2L engine with carbs and 2L 
FI heads.

The answer depends on what model of 1.8L heads you are working with.

1974 1.8L heads have no hole for the temp sensor II, and have ports for 
the smog pump that will need to be plugged.

1975 18.L heads will fit a 2L engine, but the valves are bigger. In 
theory that should bring you additional power, but in practice I'm told 
it doesn't. AT least not if you stay with the stock FI.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
