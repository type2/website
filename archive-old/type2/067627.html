Subject: Subaru Aircooled

&gt;Subaru made a few different aircooled cars in the 60's....
&gt;They were called &quot;360 Deluxes&quot; as cars, (displacement?) and
&gt;I dunno what as vans and trucks.  Rear engine, two-cylinder
&gt;Kawasaki 2-stroke powerplant.  Cylinders fired together.. 
&gt;very simple motorcycle engine!!!  4speed tranny also, and they
&gt;sound like weedeaters driving down the road.  I've driven a 
&gt;67 360 Dlx, suicide doors(!) and all, and you can barely fit
&gt;one person in these things.  Ten inch wheels, for cripes sake!
&gt;They also made a pickup trick that had a ramp-side bed gate.
&gt;Oh yeah... And the Subaru dealers can still get PLENTY of NOS
&gt;parts for them at _REASONABLE_ prices!!!!!!!

I have seen one of these up in the hills of PA. Neet little buggers, 
you can almost see the Subaru engineers with the big calipers and
a '60s splittie in a hidden lab. But, someone must not have been
very good with the slide rule, and it came out 3/4ths scale.

The one in PA is 'Sold' to a gent about 4 years ago, who was going
to 'come back next weekend and pick it up'. Never seen from again,
and the VW guru that has it (Big collection of T-IIIs, all rusty
heaps, because he took all the glass, doors, and interiors and 
moved them inside a barn. Too many possums for me to investigate
further.) But, I digress. It does turn over, but is sinking
into the mud. I keep trying to offer the dude money for it, like
$100, but he says 'I sold it, and I will give it to the guy
who bought it.' Sometimes principles are such a PITA. #;^]

Neat vehicle, would be good for parades or carrying home a 
1/2 sheet of plywood. Or, three small, friendly, contortionist midgets.
