Subject: Ball joints

Quick question. I had my ball joints pressed out/in last night and the
guy did not line up one of the joints. The grooves in the joint are not
aligned with the stubs on the torsion arm. The joint is about 3/4&quot; off.
Will this create a problem or will they work o.k. I think it will only
matter when trying to get them back out.
