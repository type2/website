Subject: Re: [T2] The EASIEST way to remove T4 engine pic!

Hey,
Don't sweat the flames. This is what I did to my daily driver. I have
pulled the engine numerous times and have it down to a couple of hours job. I have aluminum brackets that I put her back together with and she is solid. When I cut her the first time I did a clean job and
it is not very noticable. Should come this way from the factory IMO.
Peace,
Maui Haui
