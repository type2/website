&gt; Hello all,  I need to get some things straight.  I have a 1971 AD
twin port
&gt; engine in my
&gt; bus and am about to get stuck-in to some overheating prevention.  As I
&gt; understand it,
&gt; the two flexible hoses from the fan housing to the floor of the
engine bay
&gt; are purely
&gt; to pass air through the heat exchangers and into the cab, as such
they play a
&gt; relatively small role in cooling the engine.

This is basically correct.  These hoses supply pressurized air to the
heat exchangers.  As long as the heat exchangers are intact and well
sealed then these hoses will work properly.  If the heat exchangers
are leaky or if parts of the heat system are missing, then these hoses
can lose excess air that otherwise would go to cooling the engine.  If
you aren't using the heat then you can seal the openings in the fan
shroud and at the rear tin to eliminate air leaks.

&gt; The longer hose on the right
&gt; confuses me a little, is this regulated by the thermostat? letting
warm air
&gt; back around when engine is cold?  If this is the case then the
largest volume
&gt; of fan air must be blown under the engine into the space around it
created
&gt; by the lower tinware. Is there a designated outlet for all this
cooling air?

The longer hose serves to supply the carburator with air heated by the
cylinders.  It draws air from a duct that ends at the #2 cylinder fins
and feeds it to the air cleaner.  On a stock '71 it is not connected
to the stock thermostat bellows (it is on earlier years) but there is
another thermostat in the air cleaner inlet that controls the
temperature of the intake air.  This hose has nothing to do with the
cooling air or with the cabin heat system.

&gt; o.k so imagine now that you unclamped one of the two similar hoses
from its
&gt; position
&gt; on the floor of the engine bay.  If you were to look down this
short pipe,
&gt; you are
&gt; basically staring into the small box that is fixed to the muffler,
exhaust gas
&gt; flows
&gt; through here yes?

You're looking into a small heat exchanger that goes around the rear
exhaust pipe.  The bottom of this small heat exchanger should be
connected to the main heat exchangers with a wide metal sleeve that
clamps around both parts.  If this sleeve is missing (if you can see
daylight when looking down through the small heat exchanger) then you
should takes steps to fix this air leak.

&gt; When I look down that short pipe I can see a small tube
&gt; coming
&gt; from the engine and terminating (open ended) inside the small box. 
Doesnt
&gt; this mean that exhaust gas is then mixing freely with the air that
is then
&gt; blown through the heat exchanger? instead of being taken directly
into the
&gt; muffler. Should the small tube from the engine continue towards and
seal to
&gt; the muffler? thus allowing the air intended for my the cab to blow
around the
&gt; tube and on into the heat exchanger.  

Yes, the exhaust tube should go through the heat exchanger, not open
to it.  I'd take another look at the thing to make sure that you're
really seeing what you wrote as it sounds very strange.  Start the
engine and see if exhaust comes out of the small tube into the small
heat exchanger.  If it does, you need a new muffler assembly!

&gt; This is worrying me, big time.  The small box that we are
collectively
&gt; looking
&gt; downwards into is also completely loose, held in place only by the
now removed
&gt; hose
&gt; and its position relative to other bits of tinware.  I cant use the
heating
&gt; for fumes and
&gt; had assumed a heat exchanger had corroded but this seems a more
likely cause.
&gt; Both small boxes at either end of the muffler are in the same
condition.  

The small heat exchangers are crimped around the exhaust pipe and can
be a bit loose without a problem.  If they are _really_ loose either
replace the muffler or braze up the gaps to tighten them up.  The
small exchangers move a bit to make it easier to line up the clamp to
the large heat exchangers.
&gt; 
&gt; So, am I completely wrong about general air flow? 

No.

&gt; should the muffler and small boxes be a one piece unit?

No, but they shouldn't be too loose either.

&gt; will I make it to work today with the window closed?

Only if you work at a mortuary, the way that you describe the situation!
