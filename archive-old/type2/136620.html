Subject: Re: [T2] clutch scrape?

Ordered the BusDepot clutch package that comes with a new plate. Got a
pilot bearing and a cable too figuring buying parts that aren't broke
may help sway my karma :)

I've been researching the task of replacing the clutch, and everywhere
seems to say &quot;have the flywheel resurfaced&quot;. Ok. Great. Need a machine
shop for that. 

NW Oregon / SW Washington ACVW folks: Do you recommend a machine shop
over any other? Any interest in helping out on an engine pull? I have a
case of Mirror Pond if that helps pique your interest any :)
