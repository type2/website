Subject: '77 Jalousie Window rubber source? 

This was discussed at length both on-line and privately as I was at that
stage of the '67 resto from heck. The bottom line is that your windows will
be different than those in the '67 model year. Secondly, I initially
anounced that I had located a decent match but it ended up being far from
usable for the '67 and earlier style. I had to make do with good used bits
as I found them and sprayed them with grey vinyl dye to make them look
fresh. I do believe that either Wolfsb. West 
&lt; wwwinfo_at_wolfsburgwest_dot_com &gt; or WCM is (may be) doing the rubber for your
year. Check them out or go snooping at either local RV suppliers or decent
window and glass shop(s).
