Subject: Automatic Transmission

Happy Holidays folks...
I need assistance with extracting an automatic transmission.  Bentley is not
clear enough for me.  I have two cables on a lever mechanism.  One lower,
secured by a &quot;c&quot;clip that came off nicely.  The upper cable is a ball / cone
connection, connected to the accelerator shaft.
My folks are telling me to remove a rivet on the tubing in the front of the
transmission and all will come off nicely...My question is, how does the
cone connection come off the ball?

In the for what it is worth department, I cut the cable on the donor bus,
and now I am told these are NLA anywhere... So I need to be very careful on
the good bus.

Thank You!
