Subject: Accordian Heater Tube

  ..My accordian heater tube mysteriously disconnected itself (my 1970 Westy 
has a mind of her own) . I go to connect it ,seems simple, buy a new clamp, 
but the end of the accordian heater tube, where it clamps to metal tube that 
goes to front of bus is much to large for metal tube. Is there a gasket that 
goes around metal tube . Should I make a gasket. Bentley  or Idiot does not 
address this tube.  Maybe someone put a tube from different year  local parts 
guy says .(what does he know , he drives a pinto) . Another thought , while 
looking at it , did they put any asbestos in these vehicles , there is a 
white crumbly piece like gasket  in accordian tube. Anybody replace one of 
these?
