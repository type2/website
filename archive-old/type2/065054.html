Hi All,

A Porsche collecting friend of a friend in Lincoln, Nebraska has a Bubble
window era Single Cab for sale.  It is a project non-mobile truck and has
a engine sitting on the bed that goes with it.  It was originally from
Wilbur, NE for whatever that is worth.  That's about all the details I
have on it other than it is reportedly a decent truck.

If you are seriously interested and capable of retrieving this, let me
know and I'll get you in touch with the seller.  I dunno the year or price, 
sorry.  Sounds like it may be a good deal though.  L8r,
