Ray &amp; Pat’s Great Baja Beach Adventure....Chapter 3

Feb 23rd - Early evening...
As we pulled into Mulege after our ferry trip, we decided to pamper
ourselves &amp; stay overnight at the recently reopened Hotel Serenidad owned by
a gringo named Don Johnson (no, not Nash Bridges).

The Serenidad is located right next to a dirt airstrip that was the primary
'game' in town for many years before the Trans-Baja highway was built and
allowed all the Norte Americano RV's to roll through the area... Seeing
Mulege brings back memories of the early 60's when Ray enjoyed listening to
a popular Frisco morning radio show host, Don Sherwood, that would rave
about
traveling there in a small plane with his morning airborne traffic reporter,
Hap Harper... Sherwood would talk about quiet Mulege, with it's great Hotel
next to the airstrip...He would broadcast how he and Hap would frolic in the
warm sun with the senoritas and the cool drinks for a couple of days &amp; then
wing back to S.F. to make we listeners long for such a 'lost weekend' in our
lives!...

Ray suspects Sherwood would avoid Mulege these days, due to the influx of
gringos in the RV parks along the river - but it was still 'new' for us this
trip...The old Serenidad Hotel has been spruced up nicely - pleasant staff,
clean rooms, 'some' hot water, good food, and the TV and phone are in the
bar!...A fellow quest told us the Hotel's Saturday evening pig roast was the
greatest...we thought about trying to get back to give it a try, until we
found that a gringo group was coming in to take over the entire hotel for
three days...we decided to take a 'rain check' this time!

The next morning (Feb 24th) we enjoyed our morning coffee out under the
Hotel's palm trees - we brought our own French Roast beans with us, along
with small 110 volt and 12 volt coffee makers - most Mexicans use that
dreaded instant crap down here, so we came prepared!...After enjoying our
'Java' while watching the humming birds in the garden, we loaded up the bus,
checked out, dropped off our laundry in town, and headed south for Bahia de
Concepcion (Amorous Bay) and some beach time!

As our new friends from the Ferry, Jim &amp; Lynn's 'digs' were on one of the
first beaches, Playa Los Naranjos (The Orange Beach), we headed there for
our first stop...'Naranjos' we were told, is named for the many orange
colored sea shells that are found in the area - however we just naturally
figured it was named after our bright orange VW bus!...while we visited
there, we just had to rename the place &quot;Playa Los Naranjos Autobus&quot; - The
Orange Bus Beach  - or O.B.B.

The 'Naranjos' beach property is owned by a Mexican fisherman, Armando, who
has transformed the sandy shoreline into a small bit of Baja Heaven on the
western shores of the protected 'Bahia de Concepcion’...Armando has
constructed several new shower/bathroom units with large tanks above to hold
the fresh water he hauls from town in his tank truck...he’s planted many new
trees and
flowers around the property and has his crew water them several times a
week...Naranjos' main attraction is the group of about 25 shore side
palapa/huts rented on an annual basis to mostly US &amp; Canadian
retirees...these 'renters' 'improve' their basic palapas with amenities such
as sat/tvs,solar panels for electricity, gas refers and stoves, etc, etc...
Kayaks, Sailboards, small fishing boats, VW Buggies, and lots of sun lotion
are common sights among those lucky retirees 'parked' there on the shores
of the calm bay...

Armando has also built six large 'bungalows' back from the beach for
drop-ins like us...This is where we parked our stuff for the next three
days!...These bungalows are new, clean wood cabins with comfortable beds,
battery powered lighting and raised cement floors...they have screen windows
all-around, with plastic pane windows that fold down on the inside, and
colored curtains that match the cabin's exterior trim (we were in the ‘Blue’
cabin)...
They have palm branch roofs - real 'desert island' accommodations - oh yes,
all for the outlandish price of $10 US per day!...in the mornings, Armando
fires
up the shower boilers with wood scraps to heat the water...'heat' is a
relative
word, here...but it did take the chill off the water from the overhead
cement tanks...During the hot summer months, we bet that cool water feels
great right out of the tank!

During our brief visit, we met most all the beach palapa residents
(Pat never meets a 'stranger', you know); collected many sea shells;
watched a pod of five whales that were lounging a half mile from shore;
watched two 'grannies' on a wave-runner 'play' with several dolphins as
they did 'wheelies' in the bay; listened to the coyotes across the bay in
the early morning; and watched some great sunrises and sunsets;
to say nothing of the thousands of stars almost close enough to
touch in the early morning sky, after that large round moon had 'set' over
the desert mountains in the West.

One evening, after a great dinner and several 'Grande' Margaritas at the
gringo friendly 'Palapa' restaurant on the main road to Mulege, we returned
to our bungalow in the cool evening air...feeling in a real Mexican Party
mood, we parked the bus along side of our bungalow, rolled back sliding
door, cranked up our 'Killer' CD/Stereo, and played cards till the wee
hours...
the memory gets a little fuzzy here, but Ray believes he was able mix up
another
batch of 'sundowners' before the ice cubes melted...It doesn't appear we
kept the
whales up with our 'noise' that night, as they were still blowing 30 foot
high plumes
of 'Whale Breath' in the morning not far from our shore...

By the weekend, it was getting time to think about heading back north and
plan our Border crossing...we'll cover this last part of our Mexican
Adventure in our last episode, chapter 4...

Hasta la bye, bye for now...
Ray &amp; Pat
