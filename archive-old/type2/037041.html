&gt; I bought the video Spray Painting 101 by Len Stuart from a url someone 
&gt; provided on the list in 1998.  The video is great.  It took me from knowing 
&gt; nothing to doing what I think is almost a semi-professional job on my Thing.  
&gt; I'm now ready to tackly my bus.
&gt; 
&gt; I was recommending the video to someone and don't know where to get it any 
&gt; longer since the old url doesn't work.  Does someone have a good url or 
&gt; telephone number?
