Subject: Fwd: [T2] The True path to enlightenment

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;You know that you have reached a new plane of conciousness when your
&gt;painstakingly rebuilt,
&gt;  spanking new,  shiny 2 liter longblock  that you only installed 2 weeks
&gt;ago begins ticking,
&gt;  quietly at first,
&gt;then it gradually gets louder and louder until it  sounds like the Hammers
&gt;of Hell beating the very life
&gt;out of the engine.
&gt;The engine that has become like your baby over the weeks that it took you
&gt;to transform it
&gt;from it's dirty, neglected beat down condition back to a like new
&gt;condition.
&gt;  The Hammers finally getting so loud inside your baby that you run to kill
&gt;the ignition
&gt;  before something comes flying through the case and really puts an end to
&gt;it.
&gt;SNIP:


Oh, Mike: Been there. Acted like that. After successfully building 
maybe ten engines, the past three  have been disasters.

The same painstaking cleaning and assembly that you describe. Run for 
an hour on a test stand. The sound that was not there gradually 
becomes a banging.

It gets worse. I disassembled each one and could find absolutely 
nothing to account for the noise. Nothing. &quot;Miced&quot; the crank, rods, 
and all else. Found the weights of the pistons to be within .4 grams 
of each other. Meanwhile, the bus has sat for 14 months while Geico 
just smiles. A jinxed vehicle?
