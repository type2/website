Subject: RE: [T2] Engine Drops and Dirty Cylinders

I'll spare the rants for the time being.  At minimum, I don't see this
engine getting back in the bus by end of tomorrow with the issue at hand.  I
hope Don's engine has a better plan than mine.  We shall see in the morning.

On a side note, I can't help but feel were cheating by using this atv jack
;)

Until then, http://wical_dot_com/wp/?p=16  Check the pics and see what you
think.

Rings?

Later,
Troy

My first comment was the rings were shot. The more I look and the more I
think about it, it seems it's pretty obviously rings. The valves are
seating, the intake ports are clean. The heads are new, apparently. New
castings, not rebuilt.

What do ya'll think?
