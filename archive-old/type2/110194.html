Subject: Re: [T2] Bosch relays

&lt;&lt; Does anyone know an alternative source for Bosch automotive relays? I've
found the real German ones at www.partsexpress_dot_com for $1.99 each which I
haven't been able to beat locally.
 &gt;&gt;

Bosch recently announced it's going to increase its Chinese connection
by about 60%...(A Volvo engineer on another list bemoaned the &quot;word
from upstairs&quot;, i.e. Ford, that the usual Volvo sources were going to be
supplanted by cheaper third world products supplied by Ford...)
