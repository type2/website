Subject: 73-79 nose
To: aircooledswapmeet_at_egroups_dot_com, type2_at_type2_dot_com

OK i am finishing parting out a 74 bus it has a almost perfect nose on it. 
Body is orange in color if anyone cares. But i need to get rid of this nose. 
there is just a slight bit of rust in the window sill. Nothing bad at all. I 
can cut it out where ever you want it cut at or you can cut it your self. I 
need this gone real soon though. I am letting it go for real cheap or trade 
for parts. PLEASE someone take this off my hands and fix your busted nose or 
do whatever you want with it. I am located in N. IL

Dan
