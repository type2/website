Subject: Last summer revisited

Hey Everyone,

For those of you who remember (check the archives if not) last summer I 
blew a head on my 2.0 1976 Bus.  When I removed the head the jug came 
with it.  Long story short I broke the oil ring putting it back 
together.  For the rest of the year it burned more oil than Saddam did 
durring the golf war.  This year I went to work.  I had to replace the 
jug because when the ring broke it hurt it bad.

Well it is all back together now and not burning a drop of 
oil....but...I notice the exhaust manifold needs to be replaced .  I 
can't find it on the CIP website.  Does any one know where to find 
these.  On the 76 the manifold and heater boxes are separate.
