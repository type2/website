Subject: faintly glowing ignition light??
Date: Wed, 18 Apr 2001 21:48:19 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

My ignition light on my 1600dp equipped 70 adventurevagen is faintly glowing
(it started tonight...) It goes a little brighter if I turn on the
foglights, but then goes back to dim.  No matter what rpm the light stays
the same....

It is about 1/4 of the brightness as when the engine is off and key on.

Any ideas as to why?? I'll run out in the morning and try to get a voltage
reading at the battery...

Thanks to any and all help and I hope to see you at the wetwesties camping
event before the springmeet!!
