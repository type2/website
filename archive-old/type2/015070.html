&gt;Allen heads suck. This may be a news flash to &quot;anyone with any sense,&quot; but
&gt;IME the odds of rounding out an Allen bolt are at least treble those of

&gt;And also, IME, the Allen wrench stubs you need to turn an Allen bolt with a
&gt;torque wrench are very, very soft. OTOH, the 12-point driver I use is very
&gt;durable; I've pulled a lot of CVs with this driver and never rounded out
&gt;one.

Everyone has different experiences.  I like Allen heads because they allow
me to use an impact driver, and it's never failed me.  By the way, if you
are having problems with CV bolts, use an impact wrench.  In fact, if
you're having problems with any bolts use an impact driver.
