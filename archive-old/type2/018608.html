Hi All,
I plan on doing a subaru engine conversion in the future. Since I have
an '81 air-cooled model, I will need to install a radiator and the
associated plumbing. I looked through the archives and did not find much

info on installing one, or how to do it, and would the one that's in the

VW water boxer be adequate?. If the one that is used by the water boxer
would work, how difficult is it to install?. Has anyone done this? Any
help or ideas are greatly appreciated.
Thanks.

Mark K.
