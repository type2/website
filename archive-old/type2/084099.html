Subject: Re: [T2] Living in a Bus

Atta boy Rob! In furtherance, using someone else's address illegitimately,
trespassing on anothers property by camping in a quiet industrial area w/out
permission (including advice on how to avoid detection), and using an area
business' bathroom for other than it's intended purpose (namely so that paying
customer's have a toilet and sink available when patronizing) and otherwise
bumming off others can all be appropriately described as 'another thing'.  Is
spreading such baloney the highest and best use of the list? Not in my
estimation.

&gt;
&gt; I know there isn't much bus content here and we should kill this thread, but
&gt; I just hate to see the promotion of:
&gt; just because I own a bus too I am going to give you something for free,
&gt; especially a place to live.

&gt; Matty,  I got kicked out of my house when I was 17, but I worked every day
&gt; and paid my bills sharing with a roommate. I now own my own house and I am
&gt; not rich, but I am responsible.
&gt;
&gt; Touring the country as a reward to yourself is one thing, bumming off your
&gt; friends is another.

&gt; &gt; If your job is sedentary and it's not too hot, you can shower every other
&gt; &gt; day, usually at a friend's house.  Laundry facilities can be had as well,
&gt; &gt; especially if you're hanging out with friends where the laundry is free.
