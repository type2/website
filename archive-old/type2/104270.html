&gt; &gt; Im a valet driver and we have NEVER gotten a bus,

&gt;&gt;since I have Handicapped tags on my bus I get to Park RIGHT in Front &gt;&gt;of
&gt;&gt;thier faces (when I can actually find an empty accessible spot)  and
&gt;&gt;there
&gt;&gt;is very little they can say about it......
&gt;&gt;yeah, since my bus has hand controls in it, I just smile nicely at &gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;Valet and ask them if they have been certified to drive with hand
controls??

While I have not been 'certified' in any way, I have driven cars with hand
controls before.
Bring me your Bus and I'll take care of it.
