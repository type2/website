Subject: Nut size on fan end of generator

Hey...

I'm trying to put an alternator in my 70 bus, but I can't get the generator out...  I noticed there was a very large nut on the front end of the generator that holds the fan on.  I think if I remove that, the generator will separate from the fan and come out... please correct me if I'm wrong.

Anyway, I need to know the size of the nut, so I can go beg, borrow and/or steal a socket from work tomorrow.  Anyone have that number for me?

Thanks.
