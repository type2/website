Subject: Bug Wiring Diagrams Scanned

        Having no life, I scanned some bug wiring diagrams.  I don't really
want them, since I don't have a bug, and my web pages are bus-only.  But I
don't wanna just throw 'em away.              

        I'm offering, for a limited time, to let people download them from
my web page.  I have 5 diagrams scanned, from '61 to '68.  I have diagrams
for up to '73 or so, if desired.  I don't have any earlier ones, but I'd be
glad to scan them.

        I would LOVE to get my hands on some split-window bus (or bug!)
diagrams, to scan those.

        They average 750k _each_ (high quality scan, thank you very much!)
I'll leave 'em up for a week or so.
