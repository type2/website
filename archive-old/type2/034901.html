Sure you can, as many 72-up buses were so equipped in Europe.

You need the proper engine tin to fit the late model engine bay.  I
_think_ that the Bus Depot got a bunch of that tin on their European
trip a few months back.  Check them out!

There might be a problem with the length of the transmission input
shaft.  Check it before you bolt the engine up!
