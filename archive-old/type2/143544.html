&gt; I was skeptical about the word &quot;gage&quot; as a euphemism for marijuana, but 
&gt; found this enrty in Wikipedia:
&gt; 
&gt; Reefer was common in the early twentieth century, but it is now often used 
&gt; only humorously, often in reference to the 1930s propaganda film Reefer 
&gt; Madness, which significantly misrepresented the effects of cannabis. Terms also 
&gt; from this time period are: mex, muggles, gage, viper jive...
&gt; 
&gt;    Part your dreads and look up &quot;ganja&quot;...&quot;gage&quot; is derived from it... 8-)
