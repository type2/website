&gt; Usually if you can see a little rust on the bottom of your windshield it
&gt; means there is quite a bit of rust beneath the windshield rubber.
&gt; I had to have mine pulled out, they sand blasted it primer-sealed
&gt; it and put it in with a new window rubber.The sooner you get this job
&gt; done the better since rust only gets worse with time.


I just received some genuine VW windshield seals that are very useful for
this. Besides being genuine VW (virtually unavailable for some time), these
extend just slightly lower than the original ones did, not enough to be
particularly noticable but enough to conceal any minor rust repair that
might be just below the line of the original seal.  At $17.95, they're
cheaper than the Brazilian ones usually sell for. If you order the
windshield seal listed on the website, this is the one you will get.

These are just one of items I got on my container load from Europe. Some
really good deals, and a few rare bits as well. Details to follow within a
few days.

Regarding the windshield, Safelite Auto Glass (a national franchise chain)
runs bus windshields for about $99 installed in many regions, excluding the
seal.  Remove your old windshield, do the rust repair, order one of my
seals, and pay them $99 to do the rest.  That way, if they break it putting
it in (which they seem to do about 1 out of 5 times, in my experience) it's
their problem not yours. Besides you'd probably pay close to the $99 for a
used junkyard windshield anyway.
