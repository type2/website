Mat,

First things first: your bus is REALLY BIG (volume wise).

Even if you go with a propane/electric/kerosene/etc. heater, you're 
going to need to put out some serious BTUs to keep yourself warm.

With that in mind, I've found that if you can effectively seal off the 
drivers' &quot;compartment&quot; from the rest of your bus, you'll be able to 
stay nice and toasty.  This generally involves creating a divider that 
is see through (at least on the top) so you can see out your rear view 
mirror.

Personally, I like the stock heat.  Even without my bus &quot;sealed 
properly&quot; (although it's not too bad), the bus isn't too cold (when 
it's filled with stuff and therefore, there isn't much volume to heat.  
If you're concerned about toxins, you might want to pick up a CO meter, 
which would be one of the main concerns.

But, basically, if you can keep that cab area &quot;sealed&quot; (or otherwise 
minimize the interior volume of the bus) you're going to have a lot 
easier time staying warm.

Good luck!
