Subject: Got it running!! (was on knees begging for help)

I was killing time yesterday when my brother came over to see if I was
working on my bus ( since it was such an nice day ). I had planned on just
popping open the rear, cracking open one of many beers and just staring
blankly at the engine and wondering what could be causing my situation.
Anyone following the previous string knows that this was a baffling baffling
issue. It would run just fine when it  was cold and It would just shut off
after it got up to operating temp. I replaced a whole list if hardware (some
things twice) in an attempt to fix this and nothing seemed to resolve it. 

 

Anyway, my brother is  a pretty knowledgeable guy when it comes to older
volkies. He has a 63 bug, 5? Bug, 73 camper and a dune buggy. So I figured
I'd take another crack at it with his help. Long story short, we did a few
checks and he decided we needed to replace the distributor. I'm skeptical
but sick of the situation so I'm game. My brother, being the connected guy
that he is has a &quot;buddy&quot; that always seems to have the part that you need
brand new and in the box mind you, sitting in  a box on a shelf in his shop.
We go over there, pick it up fort he good guy deal of 40 bucks and run it
back home.

 

We swapped out distributors and let it idle for a bout 40 min in 70 deg
weather and no shutdown! Took it out for a spin (popped a few wheelies) and
no shutdown! So that's what it was the whole time. The distributor. We
looked at the old one and looked at the shaft. It was loose, sloppy and had
a lot of play in it. I don't know enough about distributors to know what
this had to do with engine temp but it was definitely the issue. I've really
only worked on autos with a crank angle sensor and no distributor. Maybe
someone can help and deconstruct this issue.

 

The great thing about this is runs even smoother and quieter than it did
before. It only got about 12 - 15 mpg before so I cant wait to road trip to
see what she does..

 

Thanks everyone for all of the help and the guidance through this issue. I
probably prevented the next breakdown with all of the things that I went
through with this issue.
