Subject: Re: Awful knocking noise from rear axle .... Help appreciated

I think that your stub axle bolt is loosening up and stripping the nut as
that is what happened to me.  Be careful as the whell will fall off.  I hope
that it is not this but I think that it is!!!  Take your nut off and look at
it and then tighten to torque if it looks fine.  Check your CVJ's if that is
not the problem

&gt; I can hear a pretty bad knocking noise from the rear left ( if looking
&gt; from behind) of my 72 bay.  It seems to be coming from either the
&gt; wheel or the rear wheel shaft but I'm not sure as it only happens
&gt; when driving along.
