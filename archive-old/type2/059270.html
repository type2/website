Subject: What model Webers?

I have a 71 bus with an 1835 GEX motor with dual Webers that was 
installed in 1987 by a very previous owner, unfortunatly I have the 
paper work for the motor but not the carbs. How do I tell what model the 
carbs are? They are two barrels and I have a lot of problems with 
backfiring, I'd like to get some specs on how to tune them but I need to 
know what I've got first. A (nonVW) mechanic I took it to said the carbs 
were too big for the engine?!?
