Subject: Re:  High compression readings

&gt;I did my first compression test on Saturday and the results were not 
&gt;what I would have expected at all.  135, 155, 160, 160.  Huh?  I checked 
&gt;in all my books and they all talk about low compression, but this is way 
&gt;too high. Could it be that my (new) compression tester is way off, or is 

There are a lot of factors that affect compression tests.  Engine cranking
speed is a big factor.  If your battery turns your engine over very slowly,
you'll get lower numbers.  Higher speeds will result in higher numbers.  If
your engine has been recently run up to operating temperature (the correct
time to do a compression test), your numbers will be higher than if you do
it on a cold engine.  Squirting a bit of motor oil in the cylinder before
testing it will give you higher readings.  Higher air density (cold, humid
air is denser than hot, dry air) plays a role as well.  You should always
hold the throttle full open while doing the test to allow the maximum amount
of air into the cylinders (FI folks should unplug your injectors first) and
of course, all 4 plugs should be removed during the test to maximize
cranking speed (ie. 0 compression on all cylinders except the one you've got
your gauge screwed in to).  And yes, finally, your gauge may be reading too
high, but I don't know how to test that.

I don't consider 150-160 psi too high for a 2.0 at all.  My stock 1.8 read
anywhere from 145 down to 130 with only a 5% variation across the board up
to when I pulled it with 60K miles on it (soon to be re-installed in Ron
Salmon's 77 double cab!).  My 74 914 2.0 has been giving readings of 150-160
psi for its first 30k miles.  And my new 914 2.0 engine in my 73 showed a
nice 150-155 at the 5k mile mark.

I'd be more interested in which cylinder showed 135 and I'd re-test that one
at the end of testing the other 3 with the hopes that it would show a little
higher.  5-10 percent variation across the cylinders is good, but anything
more than that may indicate a valve that is not seating all the way or rings
that are wearing faster than the others.
