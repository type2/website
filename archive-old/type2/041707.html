Subject: license plate ideas

Howdy y'all!
I'm getting the ol 62 registered pretty soon... and I'd like to get
personalized plates.  In WI, we have a 7 character limit....
Who has any ideas for plates?  I know that there are some creative minds
out there.... and being Friday and all.... lets put those minds to work!

I have so far...
DRIVEIT
SLOW 62
PASS ME
...those are the best of what I've thought up....
