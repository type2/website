Subject: NEW WATER COOLED CONVERSION

Ever wanted a water cooled engine without worry of bothersome head leaks?

Wouldn't it be great to spend a summer without dreading over heating? Of
course it would... and I'll tell you how to do it!!!!!

Move to sunny(my ass) FLORIDA!!!

Yessiree folks, there is plenty of rainwater to go around. Just wait until
afternoon to drive that air cooled beauty and you will have an abundance of
heat-sapping water all over your steaming engine.

I've done it and so can you for the low low price of rusty window trim and
soaked carpet.

Come on down and join the fun in rainy-ass, i mean sunny, Florida!!!


Hey, it's Friday and I can't work on the van for lack of covered garage...
might as well have some fun.
