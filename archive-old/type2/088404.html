Subject: Re:] ISO late model head stud filler

David said&gt;
&gt; Now on to the holes - they are air-injection ports that were indeed used
&gt; for emissions, but only on carburated engines in '73-'74.  This problem
has
&gt; come up for myself and for others on the list in the past.  My solution
was
&gt; to buy some M10 bolts at the hardware store and loctite them in.

What pitch would it be?  OR is it thread size?  Like head studs are 8x1.25
or something like that.

Thanks for the easy solution.

I will definitely give it a try.

Peace Brother,
Snoopy
