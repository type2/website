Hi, folks--

Thought some of you would be interested to know that it took about 30
minutes to replace the flexible coupling on the gearshift rod, and that
was mostly because the 8mm sheet metal screw didn't want to bite into the
rolled pin.  I decided that before I really got into the engine thing I
needed something to build up a little psychic momentum [&quot;gumption,&quot; Pirsig
called it].  Shifts like a champ again, and only one small mouthful of
caked road dirt for my trouble.

Thanks to all who spent 'way more than 30 minutes coaching me through
this.  Can't wait to get to the point where I have advice to give too
[other than, say, keep your mouth shut when working under the bus].

more later

Bill
