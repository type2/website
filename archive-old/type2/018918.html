as to the vac booster on your brakes......mine is a 73 and it has a booster.
it is drawn from the intake manifolds of my carbs( mine are still stock solex
32s)  a friend of mine just drilled and tapped his manifolds ona weber carb
setup....works great

one side note........i didnt know my booster system wasnt working until one
day i discovered it.....you wont believe the difference in braking......!!!!
make sure you get good hose for the line you will run up to the booster.
