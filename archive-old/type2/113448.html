Subject: Re: [T2] Trouble downshifting

&gt;Hi-
&gt;One more for all you experts: I am having trouble downshifting into second and
&gt;first. The shifter simply won't move. Sometimes I can get into second if I go
&gt;into fourth first. Any ideas?

Verify clutch cable and adjustment, verify shifter link, verify tranny lube 
is clean and full. If that don't fix it, synchros are worn and it's 
transaxle rebuild time. If the clutch is very old, it could be fibers on 
the disk braking off in chunks and jambing things or dry pilot bearing 
grabbing at the mainshaft.
