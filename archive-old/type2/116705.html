Subject: major engine teardown woes

So with this list's help, I was able to tear down my 80 Westy's 2.0 liter
air-cooled, fuel injected engine only to find that:
a) one of the heads has hairline cracks coming from both the intake and the
exhaust valves
b) one of the cylinders has a huge chunk missing out of the bottom of it
c) two of the pistons have huge gouges out of the sides, one big enough to
send a BB thru
d) one of the cylinders has two or three cooling fins missing (broke off)

So here I am....I'll be making a trip out to my local VW guru here in Ithaca
to see what parts he may have for me. Unfortunately, I'm on a budget with this
engine for the time being. Here are my questions....
1) Do any lists members have a spare set of pistons/cylinders for sale or
trade?
2) Should I replace both heads at the same time or can the uncracked one be
used again? i.e. Do the heads need to be paired?
3) Is there any chance I can buy only the parts I need (1 head, 2 pistons, one
cylinder) assuming I know there bores/sizes? Would I then have to
match/balance all the new and old parts (if this is in fact a possibility)?

I'm really just playing with this bus and would like to know BOTH the correct
way to rebuild as well as what is actually possible, say in an emergency if
all I need is the bus to make it a few hundred miles down the road. Thanks in
advance
