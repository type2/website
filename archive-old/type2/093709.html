Subject: Re: [T2] Plastic plugs (valance)

[...]
These holes threaded??  If so these are the holes where options you 
dont have got attached.  could be standard bus, commercial bus, or 
westy, or weekender.  sometimes vw is nice enough to put them in places 
where i find uses for them.  the one under my  bench seat came in handy 
for a wire entry location.  this would have mounted rear heat on the 
water cooled diesel.

&gt; Seriously I'd like to know 'cause I'm going to have to get some soon.
&gt;&gt; I noticed there are two holes on each side of the rear valance.  I 
&gt;&gt; think one
&gt;&gt; used to have a plug it in and it has since fallen out but I'm not 
&gt;&gt; positive.
&gt;&gt; Where there plugs there and what purpose did they serve?
