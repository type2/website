Well, Jason's (FasterLaster) family and my family left yesterday morning
after they spent the night at our place.  Was a beautiful day and ran
into just some light drizzles along the way.  We did not stay though
because Leah (my girlfriend) is almost 42 weeks pregnant.  We decided to
drive up with Jason because Boone, NC is just as close to the hospital
as our house is.  Plus it would be all downhill. Weeeeeeeeee  :-)  So,
we hung around yesterday and watched the busses role in.  Mark Dearing,
Steve Dolan, and a lot of others arrived toward the late afternoon and
by the time we left I believe the count was somewhere around 50 or more.
I took some pics and posted them.  We are going to be heading back up
there in a few hours and will take more pics.  The pics are here..
www.wicals_dot_com/troy/vw/hcbf   For now there are only a few...I will get
the rest sorted and put up after the weekend.  Hope everyone had a good
weekend and that the pics cheer those up who could not make it.  Later
everyone..
