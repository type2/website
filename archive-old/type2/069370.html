&gt;but seriosly, looking for a DEPENDABLE bus

Aren't we all in search of a dependable bus?  Though most busses are very
reliable, and I know that I can depend on my bus, I also realize that it is a
two way street.  My bus depends on me to do the right things.  Keep the timing
right, don't lug it, never, ever let her ping or knock, check the valves
regularly, and generally have a zen experience as the owner of the bus.  When I
am one with my bus, she is one with me and we are happy going down the road
together.

peace,
terry &amp; Sunshine

BTW, I never reached the level of oneness with my '75 Westy, so it killed itself
in a fiery death.  My past two splitties always communicated well with me and
never left me stranded.
