Subject: Plugging Exhaust Afterburn Holes?

Hey Guys,

I've learned my bus has Exhaust Afterburn Ports in the heads... There are two
large holes on the right side.  The left head has one large hole in the front
and a small hole in the back.
Does anyone know if all of these lead to the exhaust?
I still have a small exhaust leak and the large rear hole on the right has
been pinched shut. This port is not sealed completely and I think it should
definetely be plugged.  The small hole on the left rear is not plugged at all.
My local VW shop says this hole is not part of the Afterburn system, but it
looks like a port to me.  It's a tapped hole that leads to a deep cavity
within the head?

Thanks,

Tom
