Subject: '79 California ECU

Hey All:

Its great to have the list back.  Unfortunately, the list was down during
my time of greatest need.  I apparently have a dead ECU on my '79 westy
with california emissions (O2 sensor, hall ignition, funky exhaust set-up).
Does anyone out there have a working ECU for this bus (Brent J.?) that
they might be willing to part with?  It is part number 039 906 012 D.
