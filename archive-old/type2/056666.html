Subject: re:why idle increased after points chang

Idles faster....when you changed points, you probably changed the  gap from
before, which changes the dwell, which will affect the timing.  When your
points close up as rubbing block wears away,  the gap lessesn and the dwell
(how long the contacts stay closed) increases and the timing retards, and
rpm's go down.   You probably made the gap a little bigger than it was before.
Get a dwell-tach meter from WalMArt or Sears and check it- should be 48-52.
Limit is around 58 (as gap gets smaller).
As to ignition switch- they likely tried to put it in backwards- maybe you
can reverse the process?   Ignition locks are a dime a dozen at swap shows.
At least you can steer the thing if they got the steering lock to stay
open!  When we lost the key at the shore, I had to clip all the wires to
the column, pull the steering column, borrowed a hackswaw, sawed off the
damn lock to free the steering lock , and at home put in separate hidden
switches for the starter and the ignition!
