Subject: Re: [T2] PAINTING?????? WELDING?? GAHHH

Go to a local automotive paint store and talk with their in store 
specialist.  They will tell you exactly what paints need what primers 
and what primers may need other prep work as well.  They will even 
provide thinning rates as well as massive paint chip books.  They will 
even tell you the amount of and type of hardner to use.  I have done 
this with every paint job i have done.  (with the exception of my first 
one, any guesses on the results of that one?)

&gt; ok people, i just had an amazing revelation. (ready for this?) since i 
&gt; stripped my whole entire bus, i'm thinking of (gasp!) painting it 
&gt; myself! inside AND out. but before that of course i need new doors and 
&gt; windows, but...basically, i need to know HOW do i paint a bus? what 
&gt; sort of paint (not color) how many coats, how long does it take, do i 
&gt; take the body panels off? what if i find rust when i sand the existing 
&gt; paint off? once i sand the paint off, should i paint it right away with 
&gt; primer so it doesn't rust? or should i just save the money and bring it 
&gt; to a proffesional.
