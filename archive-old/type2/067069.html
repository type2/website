Van, I did  not even consider the possibility of painting and unbending and unbondoing
my van until I read some of the discussions here and on the web.

Now I wonder what would be involved and $involved$ in making my van look nice.

The front end was in a collision, and the PO did a pretty cheezy job of &quot;fixing&quot;
it.  It looks like this big goofy smiley face, and I kinda like it...  but...

There is the big wad of bondo, the front is all crumpled to hell, and the skirts 
around the area are pretty rough/rusted.  It's been painted over, and doesn't look
terrible, but...

You guys are telling me, that for money, I could have this made to look nice (newish!?)

How realistic is that?  Are we talking about thousands of dollars?  From where I sit,
I could get my next bus for less.  OTOH, if I can have this kind of work done and not
go broke, and limit my expectations to what's reasonable, I won't NEED my next bus.

Tell me more!
