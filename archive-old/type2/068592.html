Subject: 1969 VW Pickup Truck

I have a VW pickup for sale. It is a 1969 single cab and is driven daily.
I have done the following to it recently:
* New front brakes
* new shocks
* new tires
* new battery
* complete tune up / valve adj.
* Va. state inspection
* new exhaust extractor system
* Everything works !!!

This is really a classic truck and in great shape for restoration.  It was owned
by a Washington area VW dealer since new, and used as their parts runner.
The sheet metal very good, and the only damage resulted from a rear end
collision - but it is really minor.

Pending college tuition payments force me to sell it, otherwise I wouldn't
consider it.  The asking price is $ 4000.00.  This is a great daily driver that
attracts a lot of attention wherever it goes.

I can be reached most days at 540-869-0811 or 540-869-9931.  The truck is
located in the Winchester, Va. area - 1 1/2 hours south of Harrisburg.  I can
send pictures if anyone as really interested.  

Ask for Jeff Burke.
