&gt; VW  designed thier vehicles to be driven floored without ill effects. Top

&gt; If you can't floor your motor  for extended periods without running hot,
&gt; something in the combo is not  right (or not as good as it was from the
&gt; factory).

And no one on the list can possibly have a Bus as good as it was from the
factory...Twenty plus years of even just sitting around much less driving
makes for a lot of collective metal fatigue, not only in the engine but on
the suspension and transmission parts...My guess would be the collective
fractional losses adds up to a greater strain than a new Bus would have to
overcome with everything new and freshly greased or oiled...
BTW, has anybody out there got a &quot;new&quot; and correct dizzy, FI or carb/s
on their engine... ?-(
