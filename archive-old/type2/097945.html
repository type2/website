Subject: re:gel cell

I work at NYC Harley Davidson and we use 12V sealed gel cells. We have a 
couple of &quot;smart&quot; chargers,  they charge the battery as needed. One is a 
&quot;battery tender jr.&quot; Which charges the battery to it's optimal point then 
shuts itself off. The other does the same as well as charges severely 
under-charged batteries.They go for about $40.00 U.S. for the jr. and about 
$75.00 for the charger plus. I am not sure of the charge time. If you want 
some more specifics or to puchase one let me know.
