Subject: compu-fire installation tips?

Gonna put compu into the '68 this weekend.

I've read the Type I archives and some web info on the
installation and some listers have given me advice
already. Anything I should watch out for? Any
installation tricks?

My distributor is a vac advance (i haven't pulled the
dist. to check the serial no.) The engine is a bit of
a hodge-podge. Serial # indicates it's a '67 1500. But
it has been remanufactured by VW and probably rebuilt
since then. It appears to be a dp. And has a 34 PICT
34 carb. I've recently put a Bosch alternator in it.

New platinum plugs, new wires, new rotor and new cap
will go in with the compu-fire. I've got a stock coil.
Does the compufire need a special (blue?) coil?
