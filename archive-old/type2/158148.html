I was  just trying to be funny.  The image of fire coming out of my paint gun 
 struck me as hilarious for some reason this morning.  This type air  
compressor seems a bit over capacity for painting, more for tasks along the  lines of 
sandblasting.  I think the diesel powered sand blaster  compressor that I 
used says 384 CFM on the side of it.  I am not sure if  it has a tank at all, if 
so, it has a small one.

I would think that the  VW engine compressor could be used to pump up a big 
tank that would thermally  normalize the air.



Hey Richard  I thought of using another stationary tank and still  might do 
so.  Flaming paint gun would be funny but only if you didn't have  to buy yhe 
paint  LOL  later  Mark d
