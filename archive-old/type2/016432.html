Subject: What Stool?

I saw a list for a close-to-vintage westy bus with a stool.  What is
this stool?  Does anyone have a picture/description of use?  I checked
the archives and they seem really neat AND very hard to find.  Must be
worth someting;)  I know where it goes, just don't know what to look
for.   Also, I've heard something about a collapsable tire compressor.
TIA
