Subject: Steel Braided Ful line

 I have a 1968 Westy with a 1600 DP and I am in the middle of replacing my
fuel lines from the tank to the carb.
After reading all the fire issues, due to old or poor quality fuel line,  I
would rather take it a step further and replace the old line with steel
braided line. I have removed all the old 1/4&quot; (PO) lines and after reading the
archives see that the correct line is 5 mm. My question is, the braided line
comes in either #2,#4,#6 etc. and the #4 looks a little more narrow than the
1/4 that came off the Westy. The 5mm looks a bit smaller than the 1/4&quot; and
looks closer to the #4 braided line. I do not have a sample of the braided
line and don't need to make a 20mile trip just to measure up the two. Can
anyone tell me if the #4 braided line (Russell) is approx 5mm and if using
braided line is a good idea?
