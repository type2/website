&gt; Fellow Listees
&gt; Last night on the way home a very weird thing happened and I could use
&gt; some advise from the list before I go to the local Mechanic.
&gt; As I traveled the freeway at a steady 65 mph the head lights went out!
&gt; Not the dash lights or the radio, just the headlights. I was within
&gt; yards of an exit that would take me home so I
&gt; pulled off. As I continued on the exit ramp the lights went ON! and all
&gt; was fine. About 1/4 of a mile later the lights went out again and then
&gt; back on. This happened two more times then the lights stayed on for the
&gt; remainder of the ride home.
&gt; Q. Do I have a short?
&gt; Q  Is this my Alternator?
&gt; Q  Do I have a loose wire?
&gt; Q. Can I replace the Alt without removing the engine?
&gt; 
&gt; Has this happened to anyone else? Or does the bus have Gremlins?
&gt; Thanks for any help!

&gt; PS I have a 914,  2.0 ltr engine with  Auto trans.
George:
I had the same symptoms on a 73 once- turned out to be a badly corroded
terminal on the starter solenoid-battery cable connection.
You may just have to trace the current paths for the lights totally.
I'd guess it could be the dimmer relay also, as all headlite current
goes thru this.
I think when you find the offending part, it'll be pretty obvious.
good luck!
