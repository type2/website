Subject: Re: [T2] FI vs. Progressive carb

&gt; Scored a nice wrecked bus with a newly rebuild 2.0 that I am planning 
&gt; on installing in my 73 panel.  I don't personally have a strong 
&gt; preference either way, but I was wondering about the pros and cons of 
&gt; FI versus a Webber set up.  I have a 2 bbl Webber carb and manifold 
&gt; off of a 1.7 that would probably work.

if the engine is a FI engine, leave it that way, if it is a carbed engine
leave it carbs (that is FI/carb from VW)

&gt; Obvioously, the install would be easier with the carb set up, but if 
&gt; the FI is significantly better in either reliability or performance, 
&gt; I would retain it.

it is usually easier with what ever VW put on it....since the engine is
designed for that particular set up it will probably run better with the
stock set up.
