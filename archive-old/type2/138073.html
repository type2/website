Subject: Re: [T2] Monza style exhaust,

I put a Monza muffler on my '71 bus. It was supposedly the good one, painted
black with the yellow decal with the rearing horse emblem.  I loved that 
muffler.
The sound was terrific, really attention getting.  Lots of thumbs up. But 
after about
one year the tips rusted and fell off and the muffler seemed to disintegrate 
overnight.
I liked the sound but changing mufflers is too much of a pain to want to do 
it that
often.
