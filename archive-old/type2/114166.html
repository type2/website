&gt;Hello again, Volks.
&gt;
&gt;Checked EKTA, no joy.  Part number 022 129 607.  I purchased what
&gt;was advertised (repeatedly!) as a 2.0L air filter box from a
&gt;vendor on thesamba_dot_com, and it arrived today.  Much to my
&gt;chagrin, it ain't - at least from what I can tell - for a 2.0L
&gt;Type IV VW.  Similarities, yes... but even my novice eye noticed
&gt;the odd square-in-a-rectangle-with-a-gasket air fitting.
&gt;Anyone know what model this part is *really* for?  I'm guessing a
&gt;1.7, but I could be wrong - a general search of the part number
&gt;showed 1.7L Porsche 914, but the picture was very different.

022 129 607N is the 2L airbox cover.

These are the 914 airboxes for L-Jet...

022 129 607 K 
039 129 607 H 

...and they look like this:

&gt;If you know, drop me a line... I'm ready to ZIP out the old &quot;you
&gt;defrauded me&quot; email already.

Samba and eBay are full of inaccurate descriptions.
