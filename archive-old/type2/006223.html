While replacing my fried ignition switch on my 74 Transporter, I tested the
wires to find out what each one did and ended up with two that I can't
figure out. I tried looking at the wiring diagram, but I've never been able
to read those things very well.

Here's what I found:

RED = Hot lead........approx. 10 ga
RED/BLACK = Starter.......approx 12 ga
YELLOW/BLACK = Headlights.......approx 12 ga
BROWN(TAN)/BLUE = ???........approx 16 ga
GREY = ???........approx 16 ga

Can anyone tell me what those last two wires go to? If they're disconnected
at the load I could be leaking electricity all over the place!!!

Thanks,
Dave


OOPS! Just found out the GREY wire goes to the radio.
