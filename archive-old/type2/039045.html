Subject: re: Pulling the gas tank???

You do not *need* to pull the engine to yank the gas tank.  However,
if you already have the engine out, it makes it a lot easier.  You'll need
to remove anything that is higher than the dist cap and coil, and you'll
need to remove both of them.  You can then just manage to wiggle the
tank out.  There are two bolts under the Bus that hold the straps in place.
They are hard to locate but can be reached with a simple extension on
your socket wrench.

I've used the POR-15 gas tank sealer on 6 gas tanks in the last 4-5 years
and it works great.  You just need to get the big flakes of rust out and
it even seals up pin hole leaks.  You'll need a quart (with some left over)
to do the tank.
