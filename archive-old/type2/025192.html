&gt;.... 1.) can I refit the thermostat without dropping the engine?

Brennan, the thermostat can be added if the fins and the connecting rod are in place. In such a case, all you have to do is remove some tin and screw in your thermostat. The fins are almost certainly gone, though, so you'll have to pull the engine and the doghouse shruod; then you'll have to install fins, a spring behind, the bar that connects the fins, the rod to connect the thermostat, the thermostat bracket, and the thermostat itself.

&gt;.....2.)&quot;apparently&quot;, one of the hot-air pickups is blocked ( left )

Although it is possible to remove the heat riser without pulling the engine, I've found it easier to remove the engine, largely because it's CRITICAL that you get a good seal on all the connections of this assy to everything it connects with (exhaust system, heads, carb).

Hope this helps! Joe
