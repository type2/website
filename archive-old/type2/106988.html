&gt; Discussions of installing gauges, personal dissatisfaction with

&gt; this to their bus or have pics of how theirs looks?

Chris,

As far as I know no European bays had padding except maybe deluxe microbuses
(someone is bound to contradict me at this point ;-) ).  Anyway, I don't
remember ever seeing a bus with padded dash.

Provided removal of the padding doesn't leave any gaping holes (I don't know
how it's fixed on), your dash will look just fine bare.  I painted mine body
colour and it looks great with the black gauge panel, glovebox etc.
