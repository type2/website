Subject: Re: [T2] big oil leak - advise required !!!

----- Original Message ----- 
From: &quot;Christophe Guilbert&quot;
&gt; , I'll try to fix my big oil leak (I have to refill 1/4gal every 
&gt; 500Miles).
&gt; I can't see the leak from visual inspection, and it looks like its leaking 
&gt; pretty much from everywhere.

&gt; Anyway , the two front cylinders (1 &amp; 3) score pretty bad  to the 
&gt; compression test (80 vs 130 for the back cylinders). except than that , 
&gt; the engine work like a charm

 find out why you have 2 cylinders that are no good... if you have a serious 
internal problem,, you can correct the oil leak while it is apart to fix 
that.

no use wasting time and money fixing an oil leak if the engine has 2 bad 
cylinders... imho
