In light of Thom's article on VWoA's actions, do we get ourselfes in trouble
by mentioning the two letters  which denote said manufacturer of addictivce
automobiles (as in the subject line of messages).

Or do we have to include a trademark notice every time we mention VW (Note:
VW is a trademark of the Volkswagen AG of Wolfsburg, Germany). I think it is
fair to assume that using the term 'loaf' or 'Bulli' is free from these
hassles so we may be forced to exclusively use these words to refer to our
classic mini-van like vehicles (is the word bus allowed ?).

Were is all this leading to.....
Did you know that: the digit two is 'owned' by IBM (as in PS/2), Peugeot
claimed all model numbers with a zero in the middle (their cars are all
called 105, 206, 306, etc..). In my country the PTT (telco) 'owns' a certain
shade of green. And so on, and so on. I guess if you are big enough you can
claim anything you want. They probably reckon that they can outsue (is that
a word?) anyone because they can afford to pay lots of lawyers forever.
