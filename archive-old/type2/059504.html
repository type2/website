Finally got around to reading the article in the most recent Hot VWs about
Mark Stevens new 6 stud heads to put a reliable 104 P/C in a type 4 making a
2.4 engine. After driving from Knoxville to Farmington, NC and experiencing
3rd gear mountain climbs at 50 MPH, the thought of more low-end torque sounds
very interesting. I really don't want to drive faster than the comfortable 70
mph the bus will do now on flat surfaces. (At least, not until I upgrade to
KBY shocks and Yokohoma Y356 tires.

While we are talking about some bucks here, if someone was thinking about a
rebuild to end up with a reliable engine and had a 1.8 engine starting point
and planned on rebuilt Stevens heads anyway, aren't we talking about a r/b 2.0
L crank &amp; rods in addition to his $499. kit?

Is the FI smart enough to compensate for the added cubic inches (mm)? Any list
advisors have any thoughts of this step? Does the 20% increase in engine size
compute to an appx. 20% increase in HP?
