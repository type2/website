&gt; I have this on my camper and it works fine. Chances are  that it will

&gt; clamp works
&gt; just fine. First, I had mounted the sender on top of my coil. Now  
&gt; that I am
&gt; running Vanagon electronic ignition and have relocated the coil to  
&gt; the side
&gt; of the spare wheel well, the sender is mounted in place of the  
&gt; coil. Hose is
&gt; just long enough for this mounting position.

I've been thinking about making a short fitting that is M10 male on  
one end and M10 female with flats on the other so the oil pressure  
sender can simply stand off rather than require a long hose to  
relocate it elsewhere. The fitting would be the same size of the hole  
in the oil pressure sender grommet to the tin would remain sealed.

Does anyone think vibration will be an issue? I just want to raise  
the sender just enough so it can be tightened easily.
