&gt;Hi Volks!
&gt;Those of us w/older t2s have to deal w/them being under powered.Has anyone
ever researched why they were made that way in the first place?Were the vw
designers of the 60's and 70's insane when they put such small engines in
such big vehicles, or was this some kind of cruel joke? You would think
that a company w/the same origins as Porsche and a country w/ the autobahn
as their highway system would have produced faster cars.Does anyone know
why this is,or know of any web sites that discuss it?

The reasons why VW air-cooled engines were underpowered are two-fold:

1. The tax system in most European countries for automobiles is based upon
displacement/horsepower

2. The VW engines are &quot;understressed&quot;, in otherwords the lower powered
engines vs. displacement will have a longer life than those which are
higher powered. At least that was the thinking at Porsche and VW. For
example, the 1100 cc engine that Porsche designed for the beetle was rated
at 25 hp, while the same engine, modified by Porsche for the early 356s was
rated at 45 hp. 

3. VW engines, at least the aircooled variety, produce most of their torque
in the low to mid range of the RPM band, ideal for a truck and for economy.
It is interesting that the 5 cylinder engine used in the EuroVan was the
same as Audi used in the 5000 and early quartros. In the EV the hp rating
is about 20 less than the Audi, yet has about 40% more torque than the Audi
version.
