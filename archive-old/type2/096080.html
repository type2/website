&gt; I need to pull the engine in my 78 Automatic 7

I have a 78 automatic and have pulled the engine more often than I wanted
to.

&gt; It has ac, do I need to pull the compressor off? 

compressor can stay but it just adds weight, if it doesn't work and you
doon't plan to keep it, it might be easier to yank it first

&gt; Remove the coil, what about the engine tin?  Just take

yes, coil, oil filler, and the three rear pieces of tin

&gt; the FI stuff off and a few wires, right?  What about

both fuel lines, one on each side, and quite a few wires, don't forget the
regulator gen light wire.

&gt; the exhaust?  Moustache bar? How ro get that out. 

leave the exhaust if you want, moustache bar has to get removed from frame
but can remain on the engine,  I like to leave it because it is a nice
lever to grab.

&gt; Take the air cleaner and AFM off first?  

yes.

also need to remove the 3 bolts that hold the flex plate to the torque
converter, these are very hard to get to AND are unique don't lose
em.  also while pulling the engine make sure the torque converter stays on
the tranny, then pull it off it is HEAVIER than it looks also there is a
small shaft in the center that likes to come out of the tranny with the
converter, don't worry just push it back in just don't lose it 

&gt; The reason I need to do this is for many reasons.  I
&gt; have a ticking passenger side head (I hope it is only

???

&gt; the head)  All the pushrod tubes leak.  The front seal

use the newer Viton seals on the pushrod tubes

ALSO replace the torque convertor seal, it is only a couple bucks from Bus
Depot (not in catlog) this is in the end of the tranny and it does not get
pushed all the way in when replaced, it needs to be flush with the top of
the recess.

&gt; Anybody wanna spend a weekend in Blacksburg and help

where is Blacksburg????

&gt; out?  Beer money and food would be offered. 
&gt; Otherwise, I go it alone.

remember the Type 4 engine is much heavier than the type I engine, use a
good jack to remove the engine.  I take the engine out without removing
the tranny as the auto bus engine does not need to be pulled back anywhere
near as far as the manual to get out

good luck
Bob
