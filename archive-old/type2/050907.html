Subject: Re: [T2] Corroseal any good?

 That saves a step, because with corroseal you'd still have to paint over
it.

&gt; Not so, With POR 15 you must paint as well, unless it is not exposed to
UV light. I've used both products, and IMHO they both work equally well,
the big difference being Corroless doesn't stink nearly as bad as POR 15,
and &quot;supposedly&quot; doesn't have the cancer causing ingredients POR 15 does. I
treated rust on my old '76 Westy at the same time with both products, and
three years later the rust had not spread or broken through either product.
