Subject: Dual manifold hookup in a '73

Michael, I'm in a similar situation, since I'm planning a reverse
conversion from Weber progressive back to the stock dual carbs (though
on a 2.0 liter).

&quot;...  Anyway I have dual manifolds that each have one bolt on connection
that runs a pipe between them ....&quot;

As you probably know, this is EGR stuff, and can just be blocked off,
since you don't appear to live in California.  However, there may be
some value to the EGR setup just as a heat riser.  Any list HELP on this
one FROM THE LIST?

&quot; ... and also two push on connections, one near the top and one on the
opposite side facing bottom.  Can anyone tell what these push on
connections run to?  I assume one of these run to my brake booster but I
am not even sure where that it is.  ...&quot;

Where what is, the brake booster?  It's up under the driver's seat.  The
vacuum line to it is probably original and therefore likely leaky--and
thus bad for the engine and its smooth operation.  Test it, and replace
if necessary.  1/2 inch heavy duty oil line works fine.  There should be
some stuff in the archives about getting vacuum line, but the VW stuff
is apparentlly quite pricey.  You can probably also use the 1/2 inch
line to fabricate elbows from the push on connectors on the manifolds to
the brake vacuum assist pipe that runs between the carbs and connects to
the vac line to the front.  Old ones are often cracked, and leaky.  I
haven't tried this, though.  Jim Thompson of the OldVolksHome sells the
stock elbows, which aren't all that much, and probably the way to go.
And no, I don't own stock in that operation (I don't think it's publicly
traded); I just mention it because Jim sent me some very helpful info in
response to my recent queries regarding PDSITs.  Actually, I got a lot
of very helpful responses.  Given that much of it was via personal mail,
I will probably distill and post it in a followup.  If you are
impatient, write me via p-mail.

By the way, the push-on connectors on the outside down near the heads
are for the brake-booster vacuum line.  The other two, higher up and on
the inside of their respective manifolds are for the balance tube, which
may in turn have a couple of lines coming off it.  Mine has a four way
intersection in the middle, with two smaller pipes, one heading up and
back (back is back), and one forward (FIF) and down to the left.  On
mine, the former is capped off, and I have not yet figured out where the
other goes.

TO THE LIST: By the way, I'm still looking for an explanation of the hot
idle valve down by the throttle plate on the auto trans versions of the
PDSITs.
