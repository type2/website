Subject: The bus hunt continues...

Well, I'm still looking for the *right* bus.  And I *am* making progress...

But two of the best busses I have seen seem to lack the bottom panels that
close off the underside.   When you look underneath - you can see the big
girders going lengthways,  and the out-riggers that stretch from these to
the side of the bus - above this is the corrugated metal &quot;floor&quot; - but the
thin metal panels are missing.   
The question is:  DOES THIS MATTER ???

So far the two candidate busses seem to be in relatively good order, it's
just down to what I want...
1971 1600 without much of an interior for around £2000
1973 1700 Westfalia for around £3000

My other discovery was a very helpful company not too far from me (S.Wales)
- who build interiors (to your spec)  - they seem decent folks who love
their busses so I may go for the '71 - if it all checks out okay.
