Subject: FS: Genuine VW front jackpoints

I have four pair (only) of genuine VW front jack points that I got on a
closeout deal.  These are full assemblies, about a foot long or so, and fit
'68-79.  If your front jack points are rotted out, these are much more
substantial than the short (maybe 6&quot;) &quot;ends&quot; that are currently sold
aftermarket, and are genuine VW to boot.  Because I only have 4 pair, I
thought I'd offer them up to list members before posting them to the
website, so if you want a pair, e-mail me directly (or call).  Price is $59
for the pair (left and right front), plus $6-10 shipping depending on where
you live (a bit more outside of the US).  As usual, first come first serve.

Thanks,
