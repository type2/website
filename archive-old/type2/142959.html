Subject: Re: [T2] O2 Sensors

&gt; What are you trying to do? Locate a bad cylinder while driving? You
&gt; can't tune individual cylinders as easily as cylinder banks
&gt; (considering your two carb setup).

I just want to watch my state of tune while driving. I think it would
be some seriously interesting information. Particularly with carbs.

I'd *LOVE* to have one per cyl, but the gauges would be a pain to
make. As it is I think I'm going to use a single gauge and a switch so
I can read two sensors, toggling between them.

I'm having some new mufflers welded to my Empi craptastic dual exhaust
and was thinking while the welder has 'em I could get the bung(s) done
at the same time. I'm thinking on that rig 2 bungs, one for each head
right before the mufflers.
