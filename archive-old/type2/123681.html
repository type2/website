Subject: RE: [T2] CDI question - Spark PLug Gap

Hi Volks- I have run a (now uninstalled) Jacobs Bug-Pack, which is a CDI
system. They furnish the unit and spark plug wires. In the past (my '75
and Goldie (current master) I have gotten about 3/5 mpg better gas
mileage on both the 1800 and 1600 motors. The bus seemed to just run a
lot better. The spark plug wires come with a life-time guarantee and  it
is honored w/o a hassle. AMHIK   I ran a .45 spark plug.  I plan to hook
it up to the 1776 as soon as I get a base-line on the engine, probably
after I get home from EB. Ted
