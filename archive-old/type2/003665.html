Please don't be tempted to replace the fuse with something bigger, if you do
that, something else becomes the fuse and that's how fire starts.  It sound
like the motor itself is having difficulty when running. I had a problem
like this in my 86 Passat.  The wiring was beginning to melt.

I took the motor out and sprayed WD40 (wonderful stuff) into every opening,
until it was really dripping out. Spun it around by hand a few time to clean
out the muck (and it was very very dirty) and then did it again.

Left it stand for an hour or so, put it back in - problem solved.
