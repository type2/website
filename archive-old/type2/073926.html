Subject: Re: [T2] 3.5 months in a bus

Niall:
The short answer is, Yes. You need to futz with the FI at altitude. Some sold at high altitude even had a switch.
The reason for this is that the AFM senses VOLUME of air and at 8000 feet the same volume has a whole lot less molucules of air. The true answer for this is a more modern system which uses a MASS sensor (which nearly all modern systems use).
Also a feedback (oxygen sensor type) system as used in 79 and later California specced air cooleds will keep it closer, but having never used one, I don't know how good a job they do either.
I'd sure like to hear about anyone retrofitting a mass air system to a 2 liter bus.
John Anderson hinted at it earlier this year.

If I don't lean out the mixture and advance the timing, the bus runs likes its full of cotton batting when I'm at altitude, and if I leave these settings when returning to sea level, it runs way too hot.  Thoughts?
