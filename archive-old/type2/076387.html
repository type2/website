Just Kampers - How to fit CV joints&lt;/A&gt; 

This brings up something entirely off topic that gave me nightmares
that I figure I'll mention anyway.  If any of you ever update to a EV
and need to rebuild an axle, and launch into it after assebling 100's
of bus/Vanagon/FWD VW CVs without care or worry, do NOT take
the CV apart.  I can assemble a Bus CV with my eyes close in about
72 seconds (I timed it) it took me FOUR HOURS to get the darn
EV CV back together.

Mandatory bus content is that as a direct result of this I didn't get
over to Dolan's early enough last weekend so we didn't get to his
'73 front beam.  I'll make some comments on it though.  Man is that
thing pretty.  I don't know where Ron is getting them, south america
I take it, and it is sort of odd in spots not as nicely welded up as the
German beam we had in comparison, but man is it pretty.  Brand
spankin new.  Anyway it was 22F in Steve's garage so I didn't really
want to install it but somebody should enjoy the humour in my CV
experience, and I mean 4 hours for real folks, terrifying.  The beam
came bare as hell, trailing arm bushings and bearings but no Zerck
fittings, no swing lever bushings/pin, no springs, just the beam so
a bit of assembly is required but did I mention, man is that think
pretty.  Steve took a funny picture beside a rusted out typical east
coast beam he had snagged for free for the trailing arms and the springs
as it ended up and it is a real funny comparison to look at.
