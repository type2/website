Subject: For IL, IN, and OH A.I.R.S. members...

     I am planning a trip to Cuyahoga falls, Ohio the 17-19 from Mt.
Vernon, IL in
my 1980 air-cooled vanagon. I don't expect to run into any snags, but i
just thought you all should know that someone is coming through and will
need a safe place to camp in the Cleveland area. any advice on good,
safe, cheap campsites would be great as i definitley don't plan to
sleep at any rest stops.
thank you-
shane
