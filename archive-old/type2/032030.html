The plastic inserts are designed to snap on and off over the body of the 
bolt.  If you end up breaking them, they can be purchased at the dealer's 
and/or list vendors and/or well-equipped FLAPS.  As to getting the 
various bearing out, they are tight fits so you need to work at it a bit 
to get them out, but they'll come.  Don't use any prying tools to remove 
them since you run the risk of damaging things.

&gt;     Thanks to everybody for the help.  I successfully split my case 
&gt; lastnight.  Everything is going well. However, I have encountered a few minor 
&gt; problems.  I cannot remove the 6 main studs because of the plastic inserts.  
&gt; I tried taking one of the inserts off and it broke in half.  I also have not 
&gt; yet been able to remove the main or cam bearings from the case. I have not 
&gt; bee able to remove the rod inserts as well.  Those are all my technical 
&gt; problems to this point.  Thanks again.
