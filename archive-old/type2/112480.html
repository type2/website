Subject: Re: [T2] Cookin' the hub - it's done, anyone want a bite?

&gt; If you don't have the proper tools, get them.  How much does a drift cost?

When you're hub is apart and you don't have a ride, you improvise. Is it
really the end of the world that I used a socket extension to get my bearing
races out? And yes, I intend to pickup a set of drifts the next time I'm at
Harbor Freight.

&gt;&gt;Then we took her for a test drive only to find I had done the wrong side!
&gt;
&gt; Bearings, like brakes, ALWAYS have both sides done together (at the same
&gt; time)!!

Hmmmm... No one ever told me that bearings are always done at the same time.
Not my Father when we've changed bearings before, not the VW parts store where
I bought the bearing, not the VW garage I tried to get to do it but they were
slammed...
