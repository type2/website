  The First Annual Type2 Cross-Country

I hereby officially volunteer to lead off for the west coast, I live on
the coast in Big Sur, CA one of those truly mystical centers of good bus
karma :) 

I like this idea except for some emphasis on time keeping, and speed of
completion of the route.  I think part of the reason I drive a bus is
that I like to take my time, perhaps wonder on side road for a little
while and see where it leads me too.  Also I think it would be cool if
the opposite coasts medallion ends up crossing the country to return to
the first person.  As well what about having us go from one members city
to another as close to that 150 mile mark as possible, perhaps the west
coast might need to travel up to Seattle perhaps into B.C. and then down
to Las Vegas, try to get to as many members as possible and take a
picture of the two busses sitting together with the members as the
pass-off.  I will also create the web site to document the journey. 
Most every member must be near a kinko's with access to a scanner, and
if not then I will gladly scan them in myself.  I sure do know allot of
you quite well from your frequent and diverse postings, and it sure
would be great to put a face and your bus in my thoughts along with your
name.  That's it.  Hope to meet one of you, 
Scott
