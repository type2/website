Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Injectors

Guys,

I got my &quot;rebuilt&quot; injectors for $38 each(with core) from my local
vwflaps.  The seals that came with them seemed to fit well and they made
my bus that had sat for 8 years fire on the 6th turn.  Power seems fine on
a 132k original 2l.

I replaced the pressure regulator and cold start valve at the same time
with new ones also.  When I took my pressure regulator apart to see how it
was gummed up and how it worked, I was glad I paid the big bucks for a new
one.  I think that anything that I might have used to clean it would have
attacked the rubber diaphram inside.


As always...YMMV

Chers, dave

&gt; &gt; Where can I get some injectors without dropping alot
&gt; &gt; of dough?  I rememeber in earlier discussions about
&gt; &gt; some that can be found at autozone; but when I ask the
&gt; &gt; dudes at autozone, they know nothing.
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmm... that's where John got the ones I am running.  Check a couple
&gt; places and ask about injectors for an '82 Vanagon.  They are the same
&gt; injectors and a lot of places are dropping '80 and before under some sort
&gt; of 20-year rule on old parts.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; About cleaning the current injectors.  Is this
&gt; &gt; possible? any commercial places do it?  What about
&gt; &gt; rebuilt injectors?  Is this a reasonable alternative?
&gt; 
&gt; Well, if you do a google search of &quot;fuel injector balancing&quot; it will turn
&gt; up lots of places.   Generally geared to the racing set and a bit pricy
&gt; for me.
