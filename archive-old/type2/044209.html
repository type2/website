Subject: [T2] Hubcap passes along

Hi Volks,

Just so you know, the Hubcap is now in the custody of Jeff McKenna,, of
Kingston Ontario. The transfer took place at Grand Bend, Ontario Canada, the
site of the VW Northern Nationals Drag race and VW Show.

The transfer is documented at
http://www.geocities_dot_com/vw_type2/HubcapJeff.JPG , if you care to have a
look. This was also my first time out to a VW show, my first time in a
Carabus with another Bay-Window, and the first time I'd been out to a drag
race.  Got to tell you, if you haven't tried it, you deserve to get involved
with each and very one of these activities at least once. The sight of a 73
Westy on the drag strip warms your heart, let me tell you.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
