Subject: Black Bus Siting

Joe -
During the summer someone here at work commutes in a black
crewcab.  Dark tint windows, black interior, the only chrome found
is the wheels or some other exterior detail, I can't remember.

What is really weird about a black bus is the lack of visual definition.
It's hard to distinguish details from a distance, the lack of shading
differences due to shadows tricks the eyes.

Since I work at an aerospace company, cameras are strictly regulated
and I haven't met the owner to take a shot of it outside the plant.  But
then again, like a polar bear in a snowstorm, a black bus at night, or a
red ant on fire, whatchya gonna see anyway!

I've always had this stupid idea of doing a custom Microbus in all black. 
 I mean, completely, 100% black.  Finding every single tiny spot that 
isn't black, and painting it the same type of glossy black.  Inside?  All 
black.  Maybe charcoal grey lettering on the instruments, but everything 
else just ridiculously black.  So that if someone were to see my bus, 
they could spend an hour looking somewhere on it that isn't painted 
black, but they'd fail, because since winning the lottery I had spent all 
my waking hours with a spraygun full of black paint.

I realize how idiotic that sounds, but I actually dream about it on 
occasion.
