Hi all,

It's time for me to clean out my stuff.... I simply don't have the
space.

The engine came out of a '79 that had 130k on it... I haven't split the
case and can't tell if it's been rebuilt.

I have everything needed for a complete engine minus the following
items. - All FI, Crank Endplay shims, all exhaust/smog stuff, and a
couple of the hydraulic lifters.

The engine turns fine, the heads were missing 1 valve seat, some of
which was hammered into the cylinder head. The engine will come with 2
sets (8) pistons and cylinders. and I as far as I can remember, all the
tin. (Note, the heads are not from a '79, they're the '76 to '78 heads)

If you want the engine, $150 will do it, but I'm not willing to package
it up for shipping, but probably could deliver locally. (It's in two
huge TV boxes at the moment).

The Fridge/Cooker unit is out of a '75 westy from behind the passenger
seat, works perfectly and is in it's original cabinet. The fridge is
12/110 volt and the cooker has two burners. $40

Please p-Mail me for more info.

Dave
Napa, CA.
'75 Westy.
