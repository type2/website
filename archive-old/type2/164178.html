Subject: Re: [T2] T-shirt take 2

Ron, I  wasn't offended by your message. It gets scary in 
here if you don't follow the &quot;charter&quot;. I'm sure that you 
didn't do it to make anyone mad, BUT it seems some volks 
get theirselves up in a bind over such things.

Although you can occasionally find good deals on Ebay, I 
try not to buy anything on there. Samba is a decent place 
for buying. Karl on Samba has just about ANY Bus part you 
would be looking for. And for dirt cheap. I see no reason 
why links to there should be a problem. The best place to 
find parts is in person at a show or a Bus campout.

I know how you feel. After watching people on here discuss 
a subject, I made a comment. I was then scolded for not 
having Bus material in my email.



Oh...I looked at my Bus today. It was pretty.
