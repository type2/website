&gt;Does anyone know how to replace the rear engine mounts on a 78 bus?  I have

They are easy to replace but I hear they are expensive to buy.  Replacing
those mounts is the only time you should ever put a jack under the engine,
short of engine removal.  You will have to take off the rear tin and
possibly the exhaust and fan housing to get at the upper mount bolts.  This
is time consuming, but not difficult.  Just support the engine with the
jack (just support it, do not raise it!), remove the crossbar, then remove
the mounts.
