I've had my 69 passenger bus for ten years here in Los Angeles, and believe it or not, though I'm
always keeping an eye out for buses I can wave to, I've never (really) seen the inside of a westy
with all the bells and whistles...never driven in one either.  One reason maybe is that all you
westy drivers have those fancy curtains, makes it hard to peek in the windows and spy around...

If any Westy owners in West L.A. want to give me a tour sometime, I'd be obliged.

seen a camper bus, nevermind ride in one.
