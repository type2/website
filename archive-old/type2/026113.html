A UK '78 pancake engine (CJ) is dual carb, non-hydraulic valves as
standard.  I don't know if they changed to hydraulic for '79, I doubt
it.

I like my bus just the way it is.  In fact, I'd like to build a spare
engine for it and I'll probably have trouble finding a complete 2 litre
unit in this country, so if anyone has any leads....

&gt; -----Original Message-----
&gt;  In the UK (and ROW?) you can get a &quot;'71&quot; style bus up to '79 and
&gt; beyond
&gt; (without the one-year-only issues) and AFAIK the late pancakes didn't
&gt; come
&gt; with hydraulic valves (corrections anyone? Does a UK '78/'79 have
&gt; hydraulics?) or FI (usually) so the differences are more blurred
&gt; still.
