I can figure out a place, but I want to find out where the factory hooked it up.  All the work I do behind the dash is in consideration for a future owner if and when I become the P.O.

&gt;&gt;I found a OEM clock in the junkyard a while back and want to wire it

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Where is the factory preferred terminal for hooking up the +12V connector?
