The VW bus gods have spoken, let me make a long story short,
I went camping last weekend, a couple days before we left I was
driving the old 73 camper over the the local watering hole, when I got out 
of the bus I noticed some smoke coming out from under the right side. I 
checked for oil leaks, valves, valve covers, etc. found oil was coming out 
of my oil fill traveling past the tin the going on the tin to the right heat 
exchanger. I put in a new gasket that fits into the tin, and no more smoke. 
Then took  out for test spin Friday before we left, more smoke. So I decided 
instead of messing around with it anymore
I would just take the car camping, cuz I didn't want to have a breakdown 100 
miles from home.Here comes the kicker, my car ended up dying on me at the 
campground, had to get it towed back home. Should have taken the bus, VW bus 
that is........


VOLKSWAGEN BUS
&quot;don't leave home without it&quot;
