Subject: Beetlemex Engines

O.k. so I have searched the archives for all the info on these engines 
but have found nothing as to how they run, or perform once installed.  I 
am very seriously contemplating purchasing one of these engines and I 
want to know what kind of experiences people are having with them.  Good 
or Bad.

Thanks in Advance
