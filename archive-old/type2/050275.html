Folks, I want to thank all the volunteers right off.  Didn't expect
to get as many offers as I have.  The illustrous Mr. Ken Hooper
was early to volunteer though, and frankly if Ken wants a go at it
I'd just as soon let him.  Even though he'll probably do the work on
one of those evil satan spawned rotten apple machines.

To everyone else, thanks again, if Ken decides he doesn't have
time or is scared once he sees the project, I'll keep you all in
mind.  I'm hoping we can get this up and running as a benefit to
anyone rebuilding a T4.  On an aside as well, I'd like to do an
interchange and swap section.  I have a wide assortment of stuff
but no longer have any early cases with the 2nd pressure relief
valve, nor do I have an 1800 or a genuine 914 2.0 head to take
pictures of.  If anyone has such things that they could snap some
digital pics of, or ideally anyone in the DC, Pittsburg sort of areas
that could let me come take a few, I'd be indepted.  I also wouldn't
mind a shot of the differences in the 411/412 case (is it just the
dipstick or dipstick and oil filler as in the 914?)

Thanks.

John
