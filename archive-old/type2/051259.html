Subject: [T2] Winshield Wiper Hose on '78 

Hey Folks,

I'm new to the list and hope someone has had a similar problem.

When I try to wash the windshield, I end up with washer fluid on my shoe.  
I'm wondering if anyone has advice on how to change/replace the hose.

Thanks,

Arvid in Seattle w a'78 champagne
