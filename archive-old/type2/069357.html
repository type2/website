&gt; H means it was originally a 1500.    no number means it was rebuildt and the
&gt; number ground off.

Or it's a T3 case and the number is stamped where the fanshroud sits on
an upright engine, or some one used a new case that had no number at all...

&lt;&lt;      I bought my '63 Beetle from the original owner.  The oil drain plug had
fallen out in the early '70s; the oil followed &amp; the engine was toasted.
The 40horse 1200 was rebuilt at that time with a new replacement case.
The new replacement case has only a &quot;D&quot; stamped in it; there was no number
&quot;ground off.&quot;  According to Muir, it looks like the only Beetle engines
that came from the factory with serial numbers beginning with &quot;D&quot; were
34hp 1200s.  My crankcase is of the correct style for my '63, but its only
identifier--&quot;D&quot;--doesn't appear to be related to any serial number series
of engines of that style.  FWIW :)&gt;&gt;

The 34Hp is DIN Hp, so that is a 40 horser... am i missing something?
your engine should not have a letter in front of the serial number and now
the case is replaced by exactly the same case but only somewhat newer and made
after VW started to included the letters? The 1200 D engine was still made in
Mexico in the eighties, lots of them are still around here in Europe...
If you remove the generator pedestal you can see if the hole under it is as big
or smaller than that of a 1600 case, if it's smaller you still have a pretty
early 40Hp case...
