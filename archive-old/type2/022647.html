Subject: need help indentifying mystery Solex carbs.
Message-ID: &lt;47b092a.2492c078_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hey, 
I raided a friends type4 stash today and found a set of these carbs -- I was 
wondering if any of you carb gurus out there knew what they are ( or if 
they're worth anything). They've never been used. I've not seen anything 
quite like 'em.
They're at:   http://users.aol_dot_com/my65notch/solex/solex.html

Thanks, Dan
