Subject: Re: HELP! Pilot bearing gone

Thanks for the info be let me clarify, the only thing left of the old
bearing is the outer sleeve. It has no bearings or any lip to grab on to.
I've tried splitting it with a chisel, but it seems to be REALLY  fastened.
At this point I'm afraid I'm doing damage with the chisel to the inside
housing.

Brian.

&gt; I received what I think is a new pilot bearing w/ my new Luk clutch kit. I
&gt; didn't know what it was , so I figured I didn't need it. In an effort to
try
&gt; to locate it on my engine,
&gt; I think I found what used to be a pilot bearing. This bearing goes in the
&gt; clutch end of the crank before the flywheel? And allows the main tranny
&gt; shaft to slide over? If so my old one was fried and its outer remains seem
&gt; welded to the sides. Is it supposed to just slide out? I'd like to get the
&gt; what's left of the old one out, and put the new one in. Any advice on
&gt; getting it out. I'm afraid to pound at it w/ a chissle. I was just about
to
&gt; put the engine back in and drive away!
&gt; Please Advise.
