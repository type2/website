I decided to recover and refoam my newly acquired zbed. Found upholstery
fabric for &lt;4$/yd at wal-mart the real fabric store wanted a minimum of
double that. And found a nice site online with reasonably priced foam and
the guy offerd to cut it for no extra charge.

the old fabric was trashed and smelly the foam too.
If anyone has ever priced good foam its silly expensive.
Well when i finish maybe Ill stick some pix up
cheers
