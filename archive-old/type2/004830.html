Have you tried Bus Boys in Reading, CA or Parts Place for VW's, in Auburn
Hills,MI. Lunch hour's running late. If you need more info let me know.

Subject: [T2] '70 Tranny Mount Needed


&gt;     I'm trying to locate a new front tranny mount for a '70 Sportsmobile.
&gt; Called Bus Depot and they said they had no listing for any tranny mount
from
&gt; '68-'79.  Checked the website and found nothing either. I gave my local VW
&gt; shop (LA Products) a call and they tried a couple of there supliers and
got
&gt; the same story.  Couldn't find a listing in Rocky Mountain either.  Am I
SOL
&gt; here or what?
&gt;     My mount isn't broken, but it's bent up a little.  So much that the
&gt; shift rod doesn't fit properly and gear selection is a real pain.  Thanks
a
&gt; lot for the help...
&gt;
&gt; See you down the road,
