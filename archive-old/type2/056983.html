Subject: The 77 westy gas prob and grief for a lost friend

Hi all,
I have had many helpful suggestions (thanks to all) on my 77 full
tank/half tank problem, I have not had a chance to try any of them yet
as I am devestated by the death 2 nights ago of my beloved 13 yr old
sheepdog, who after 10 days in the emergency vet hospital, came home and
died in my arms 4 hours later. He was the best, loving and loyal, he
fought hard to live but his old body wasn't doing him much good anymore.
I think he kept going and got well enough to come home to be with me one
last time. I miss him more than words can ever begin to convey. 

Today though I must start to do something and I figured I would try and
work on my bus.  I am completely mystified by the concept of vapor lock,
if anyone can explain what this means I would (and I am sure others as
well) appreaciate it. 

Several people mentioned checking the venting hoses from the tank to the
charcoal tank mounted on the fire wall. My charcoal filter is capped on
the left side, has tube intact on the right side. It has been like this
since I first acquired her 3 years ago today.  This problem only
materailized after the new engine. Could this be it, that it was
bypassed along time ago by the P.O. and some sort of work around put in
place, but when the engine was pulled and the new one installed the work
around was missed and now I see the problem?
Thanks,
Scott
