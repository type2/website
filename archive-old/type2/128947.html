Subject: Sixth annual Missouri Bus Fallout

All,

Time is coming upon us again for this most exalted of campouts. (Not really, but we like it.)

It will be the weekend of November 13 &amp; 14 this year.

All of the details as far as directions, costs, weather etc can be found here:

http://webpages.charter_dot_net/thejester69/fallout.html

Note I have changed the description of what is allowed as far as sharing sites. The rangers there have become a very by the book Joe Friday bunch.

We hope to see everyone from past years again and make some new friends as well.

take care,

Steve

P.S. please forward this on to anyone or any list that may find the contents of interest.
