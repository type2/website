Subject: Re: [T2] Electric fuel pump with stock dual carbs???
  Possible???

&gt; ...What I want to know is:  Will the aftermarket

&gt; supply both sides??


Yes to both.  As long as the flow rate is enough to satisfy those hungry
carbs, it will work fine.

Be sure to be workmanlike in the running of the lines.  Don't leave long
runs hanging in space!
