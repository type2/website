Subject: Re: [T2] Rust under pop-top

Would I be better off with a bus with rust in the lower areas of the
body?

Keep looking, there are good rust free vehicles out there.
Post your needs to the list IE: Year Model, Price Range and someone will
direct you to a good rust free Westy.
You may have to get away from the East coast to find it but I found
several in the last few years. Be patient, I looked at ten Westies over a
year and a half before I bought mine seven years ago.
If you can get it cheap enough I'm sure you can live with it but long
term it is almost impossible to get rid of rust that has started.
