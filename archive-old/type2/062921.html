Subject: What year is my bus?

Ok, one more thing. I have a cardboard (very heavy) sun visor on ONLY
the driver side. It's bright blue with a large white VW emblem on the
inside side in the center. There are no holes drilled or anything for
the passenger side, and someone in the know today told me I am mistaken
about it being a '61. 

He says that they only did that in '60, and that i have a '60. How do I
know? AM I wrong? Is he nuts? Are we all?? What other defining feature
or number code will resolve this? The title says '61, but it's been
quite an owned vehicle. The motor (laying on the ground behind things)
was from a '65 Bug, according to the numbers.

Unfortunately, I just looked at the guy, nodded like I knew what he was
talking about, and muttered &quot;Hmmmm&quot; and &quot;No kidding...&quot; a lot.

Thanks, again
