Subject: AFM adjustment

I was wondering if there is a way to determine if an AFM is adjusted
properly - ie is the big coil spring set correctly?  Is there a
specification for how much torque it should take to open the flap all the
way or some such thing?  I suspect that the spring on one that I have is too
tight.  I'm wondering because I have an almost brand new rebuilt AFM that
runs my engine very lean (great for smog tests), but can't be adjusted to my
or my mechanic's comfort level (with gas analyzer) using the idle adjust
screw.  I'm using another AFM right now and trying to get this 'bad' AFM in
working order to use as a spare on an upcoming xcountry trip.  Any
suggestions?

Later,

P.S.  My wife used to complain that the bus was difficult to drive in the
wind - I thought she was just whining until I replaced the steering box and
steering damper - Thanks Bus Depot for selling me the parts to make my bus a
pleasure to drive on the highway, and my wife happy.
P.P.S.  If you see oil and crud on your steering box - check to see if it
still has oil inside it.  The one I took out was covered in greasy sludge
and dry as a bone inside.  I wonder why my steering was so tough.
P.P.P.S  Sorry if I am babbling - excited about upcoming trip.
