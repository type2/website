Subject: Re: [T2] Engine In!

&gt; with four of us (well three actually going at it); I can't imagine doing a
&gt; T4 alone like some folks talk about.  Well, my hydrualic jack is kind of
&gt; half-assed.  Hopefully it will be running by Friday...

It's really not hard with two people - but two hydraulic jacks helps. The
amazing thing is that it is possible with just one person and one jack. On an
upright with the detachable rear panel it's a breeze. Just prop the engine up
inline with the transmission and roll the bus back!

I'm considering cutting the cross-bit under my engine compartment door the
next time have my engine out just for this purpose. The idea is: the easier
the engine comes out, the more likely you'll be to just pull it and go over it
nicely. There are alot of potential oil leaks and other &quot;details&quot; that are
easy to fix with the engine out but a PIA with the engine in.

-Eric
