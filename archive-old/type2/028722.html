Jim,

I welded a hatch into my '72. It was an all-day project and I'll be honest
with you, probably not the professional-type job most folk would want.
Personally, I always have a cushion on there, so I didn't worry much about
looks. My hatch came from a '74 or '75, but I think the later hatches are
bigger. Bigger is better.

Took about 3 hours to cut the hatch out of a junk bus; then all day saturday
to cut my deck and weld it on. I cut an opening; not all the way to the rear
door. Measure 3 or 4 times; cut once. Pray often. Kinda scary thing to do,
really.

I'm not sure if the same rules apply going down to '71, but as I recall, the
gas tank is in the same place and all. Oh yeah, the gas tank. I had that
out...along with the engine. Pretty much a requirement, I think.

If you need more grizzly details, just holler.

Good luck! Joe
