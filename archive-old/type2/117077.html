Subject: RE: [T2] Cookin' the hub - it's done, anyone want a bite?

Just my 2 cents here but is it really that big of a deal to get the tool
for removing these races? I bought a kit at FLAPS that has a variety of
diferent sized aluminum pucks that you insert a big pin into and smack with
a hammer. The aluminum is softer than the race so they dont get buggered up
going in or out. SOmetimes I used heat but just to try and break a rust
bond not to measure its coefficient of expansion. Never had that much of a
problem removing old races either with a drift, but installing new ones
that way can be disastrous if you score the race. Hope this doesn't become
a tire or oil thread. YMMV
