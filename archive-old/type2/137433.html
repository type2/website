&gt;Yes, I know how hard it is to stop a vehicle not using the power brake
servo.  But you miss the point of my question.

I understood it.

&gt;My question is there a way to switch to another master cylinder such as the
68-70 and have normal non power brakes thus saving the $159 cost of a rebuilt
servo.

Yes you can switch but where is the savings when you hit something that the
booster brakes would have prevented in the first place?

&gt;Was wondering if this 68-70 MC would work in conjunction with the front
discs...

All the brake fittings are compatible. It's just a matter of mounting and
borrowing push rods and linkages, etc.

I hope to never see you in my rear view mirror with the braking system you are
proposing.
