Hey everybody.  
as many of you know i recently trekked to NY and went
to a great music festival.   well there were tons of
buses and vanagons around so i walked around the
onsite camping area and snapped a bunch of pics.  
next year ill have to try and take a break from the
music and venture to the offsite camp area, im sure i
missed a ton.   so if you want to look at a few buses
some nice, some not so nice....check it out:
