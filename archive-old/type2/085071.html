Subject: Generator question on 71 Westy

------_=_NextPart_001_01C1FBA4.061A26B0

Hey Everyone,

My first post: Here it goes:

I bought a 71 Westy 2 months ago, I noticed in tightening the generator belt
on my first maiden voyage that it seemed odd the generator pulley was not in
line with the crankshaft pulley. I think the generator might be a bug
generator as the Bosch number on it is 113 903 031P. Can anyone confirm this
for me ? I heard that a bug generator is shorter  (also it's stamped 30
amps) and can cause problems. I'm thinking that the PO put a bug engine in
the bus....

I've already bought spare belts just in case.... Has anyone had luck
converting to a alternator on a 71?

Thanks, 

Trey Jung
