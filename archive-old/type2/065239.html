Subject: Window Removal - Splitte

Hi all. I come seeking advice and enlightment. Lucinda  67 Deluxe Micro
bus, (the long - 8 years and counting - restoration project) is nearing the
body work take my checkbook please! phase. After spending the better part
of the afternoon communing with the underside of the dash to remove gauges
etc, I need to drill out some the screws holding the side popouts into the
body. I am getting braver about doing work but would like to do it right
the first time and not mess it up anymore than I have to! I have Labeled
ALL my wires and noted the location in my notebook. Which means, A the
labels will fall off and the notebook will disappear come put together
time! Anyway, I ramble. What is the best way to drill out the screws and
then replace them later. I enjoy reading all the rest of the info here!!
Keeps me sane and looking forward to Lucinda on the road. Thanks all.
                Mike Elkavitch - At this rate my bus will be a double antique!
