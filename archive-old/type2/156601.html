Subject: Re: [T2] T-shirt take 2

&gt; I am not a list-meister, but the gist of it is that no links to ebay are
&gt; allowed, period. It may not seem sensible to be so cut and dry about it, but
&gt; I think it is the KISS principle at work. If the definitions of what eBay
&gt; links are and are not allowed, it gets confusing and messy.

I think there were a few reasons we voted on and enacted the noebay
policy.
there were starting to be a lot of ebay posts. its somewhat insulting to
say 'hey i have ___ if anyone needs it. its on ebay'. most of us felt if
we wanted to look on ebay, we would do it ourselves. there was a lot of
list traffic at the time and it was adding to the deluge.

i think it has been a fine policy. you can always pmail someone an ebay
link for something they are looking for.
