DON'T BLAME HER!  It's probably just the shifter coupling or the front bushing
on the shifter. These damn things just fail every quarter century or so.... some
sooner. Actually, an inexperienced driver WOULD probably put more pressure on
them than you do, but, still, it IS 27 years old, right?
Have someone go through the shifter motions, moving the stick sideways taking up
the slack while you are underneath watching where the lost motion is going.
You'll either see the bottom of the front shifter tube clunking around or (more
likely), at the rear, the shifter coupling cage being loose. This is about a $10
part and maybe an hour's work.
Trannys DO fail, but usually NOT from giving driving lessons, USUALLY from lack
of lube.
BTW, sometime take it into a SERVICE station and have the trans lube CHANGED  at
least every 60, 000 miles or so and grease the 5 zerks on the front end at the
same time (once a year on the front end).
