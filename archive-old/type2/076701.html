&gt; You install cast aluminum valve covers because you think they make your

Snake oil works OK, but plain ol' engine oil is better :-)

As for the ally rocker covers, the gaskets don't get in the way of cooling 
the oil that is splashed on them, so they must provide *some* cooling. 
Whether that cooling is worth the price, I couldn't say. However, they do 
increase the engine's Brake Mean Impression Ratio quite a lot :-)
