&gt; Many questions:
&gt; (1) Anyone know the minimum &quot;max load&quot; for a (rear) bus tire?

1520 pounds

&gt; (2) If a passenger tire has a sufficiently high max load rating,
does it
&gt; really matter if it's &quot;reinforced&quot;?

The bus will handle better if it is, as the stiffer sidewalls will be
more stable.

&gt; (3) Any thoughts on the Goodyear Aquatred II or the Goodyear
Integrity?
&gt; I'm looking for a nice street tire, with good grip and quiet.

They have nifty advertising campaigns.  Other than that, you'd be
better off with the Yokohama or Bridgestone 185R14s.  They'll probably
be less expensive too.

&gt; (7) Any thoughts on the use of wheel adapters? (Fuchs wheels have a
&gt; different bolt pattern, so adapters would be needed)

Adapters are never a good idea.  Better to get wheels that fit.

I seem to remember somewhere that Mercedes wheels had the same bolt
pattern as buses.  This might be an avenue to getting wider wheels. 
It remains to be seen whether the offset is correct or not, though.
