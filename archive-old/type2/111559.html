&gt; Well I changed out my cold start vavle, It was toast (literaly

&gt; still,  Can i check my timing eventhough the bus isn't running?
&gt; tonight I am going to adjust valves and attempt setting points,
&gt; Never done this before.  Pretty EZ?

If you have the muir book it covers using a test light to set the
timing. This process and setting the point gap with feeler gauges will
be good enough to get it started. Just be sure to do a dynamic check
after you get it running.
