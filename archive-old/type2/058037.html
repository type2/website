Subject: First Day of Driving and New Yokohama Tires

Most my driving is highway(since I use my bus(s) for daily driving) and
some surface streets living in Southern California.  Rain is minimal as
well.  The tires are extremely quite.

By the way, drove in the rain this morning with no problems whatsoever.

Mark, a good deal for about $45 each or so that Tire Rack and others
want,
but I find the y356 a bit squirrley in the wet being highway ribbed,
fairly
useless in snow around me, particularly when it gets under about half
worn.
Just bear it in mind in heavy downpours.  The tire wears very well
though.
Personally I'd have done the Conti for the same money instead but any
real
reinforced tire is better than crap.
