hey volks,
just wanted to drop a line to all of you who responded
and brainstormed on this post.   i got quite a few
very insightful replies as to how to make it work and
why running solar power or alternator power is more
feasible.   it was mostly just something ive had
running around in my head i had to get rid of, but
thanks again for the replies.   on a side note ill be
dropping the engine in lizzy this week, since the heat
has finally broke.   hopefully it will be uneventful
and i can fix the rod knock and get her going for a
little fall camping...

&gt; &gt; &gt; has thought about &quot;wind power&quot; to charge a
&gt; battery.
&gt; &gt; &gt; windmills can do a good job of supply
&gt; electricity to a
&gt; &gt; &gt; home so why not some type of turbine, wind
&gt; powered
&gt; &gt; &gt; generator on a bus.   driving down the road
&gt; would
&gt; &gt; &gt; cause it to turn and could charge a couple
&gt; batteries
&gt; &gt; &gt; for camp.
&gt; 
&gt; The drag on the bus would outweigh the energy
&gt; generated.  Why not just
&gt; let the engine drive the generator, rather than the
&gt; engine driving the
&gt; bus, creating the airflow to drive the fan, to drive
&gt; the generator?  Far
&gt; less lossy.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I don't suppose you'd get much current from a
&gt; &gt; setup like this, but it would be &quot;free&quot; power
&gt; 
&gt; Only when you're parked up, or coasting downhill.
&gt; 
&gt; I've just got back from the Centre for Alternative
&gt; Technology in
&gt; mid-Wales, they've got loads of ideas on this kind
&gt; of thing.  If you're
&gt; on this side of the pond, go see them, pick up some
&gt; literature.  They
&gt; have books and pamphlets on generating your own
&gt; energy from a variety of
&gt; sources.  Why not cover the roof with solar cells?
&gt;
