Subject: Re: [T2] Straight Info On SM &amp; SL Oil

&gt;I'm not sure who wrote that API article,

It doesn't matter which individual wrote it, and it's likely not 
written by an individual, but by a committee effort.

It's not an &quot;article.&quot; It defines, in the API's words, &quot;the current API 
engine oil service categories.&quot; The API is the organization which sets 
the oil category requirements you referenced (SL and SM), and that 
document is the gospel in regard to what requirements oils bearing 
those ratings must meet.

&gt;  but according to Shell oil this is the current rating of their 
&gt; diesel formula's--which exceed the API's
&gt;ratings.

While your post might apply to one specific weight of one specific 
Shell oil, it stated the numbers in general terms - &quot;info on the new 
oils your able to buy...the API rated SL oils had a zinc &amp; phosphorus 
index rating of 1000 parts per million...the new SM rated oils are now 
800 parts per million of zinc &amp;
phosphorous&quot; etc.

While some specific oil may meet your description, since it fits the 
requirements (which Shell oil, in which weight were you discussing with 
the &quot;Answerman?&quot;), it is not the case for all SM/SL oils, as a reading 
of the actual API requirements shows.

The &quot;Answerman&quot; can only be an authority on Shell oils, the information 
given in the API specification applies to ALL oils bearing the API 
designations.
