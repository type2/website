Subject: Tires and rims (Bay / Vanagon)

The rims used on Bay window buses (71 and later) are identical to those as
used on all Vanagons.

Continental is AFAIK the 'the default' tire for all VWs (I suspect VW has a
stake in Conti).

The dealer always tries to sell me Contis for my buses (Vanco series -
Conti's for Vans ?)
However recently I choose the new Michelin Agilis81 for my '81 Vanagon.
These seem to be very good strong tires with a high load ratio and and
awesomely big thread. I guess I'll never have to buy new tires for this bus
anymore for the rest of my life (come to think of it this statement does not
really convey any useful information.

I put some info on tires and rims on my website:
http://www.hrps_dot_demon.nl/jwbus/T2-tires.htm

I currently have 195/75R14 on my original VW alloys. With the Michelins I
could probably just as well have put an standard 185R14 on. Would have been
slightly cheaper. The tires that VW puts on these rims are 205/70R14 but
that is overkill for my 50 hp diesel and makes the steering go very heavy.
These alloys were originally intended for high-end buses with a lot more
power.

Have a nice bus loving weekend.
