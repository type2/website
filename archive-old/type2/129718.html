Subject: fuse location, etc?

I'm finally taking a look at the electrics in my 78 Campmobile. Before 
I hook up the auxillary battery, I've been doing a general inspection 
and acquainting myself with the system.

I am wondering if my transformer situation is correct. I understand 
that there is a fuse on the transformer under the rear seat, but I 
can't find it. Can anyone tell me where this fuse should be located? I 
removed the wooden box covering the transformer, but I don't see the 
fuse. Do I need to open the metal box to get to the fuse? Also, another 
question. The transformer is wired with something that resembles romex. 
Is this original, or has some rewiring been done? Anyone know of some 
on-line photos of the correct setup?

Thanks.

Rob
