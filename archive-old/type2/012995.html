&gt;	So my question is what should be connected to the open end and what
&gt;should control the opening and closing of this valve (i.e. there is a
&gt;control cable connected to a lever, but nothing seems to move it from
&gt;the environ controls.

The '79 (and '78) if it still has the original valves had a 2&quot; corrugated
paper
hose down to some exhaust pipes that ran along the engine attached to
the motor mount frame.  '72-'77 just vented to the atmosphere so don't
sweat it if your hose is missing, or if the pipes are gone as well.

The heat (red) levers should pull on those cables, they may be stuck or more
likely stretched to the point they don't do anything.  Cables are fairly
inexpensive
still I think.

&gt;	Also, on the passenger side, under the cylinders there is a cable
&gt;idler pully, what should the wire on this be connected to? Mine is only
&gt;connected to that sky hook.

Went to the thermostat.  Although it is a good idea to install one, they don't
last well, are now hard to find though you can make one from a T1 thermostat,
and it isn't going to kill you not to have one.  Look for the parts and
install one
as you can.

John
