&gt; I'm still trying to find a web site about air cooled Vanagons. I expect to
&gt; receive the motor for my 80 Westy in a couple of weeks and I have a few
&gt; questions particular to the early Vanagons. I thought I took good notes when I
&gt; pulled the engine about a year ago, but I always seem to miss something!

http://www.vanagon_dot_com/ maybe of some help to you.

&gt; My bigest question is regarding the orientation of the accordion shaped tubes
&gt; that go between the heat exchangers and the tubes atached to the bus. Seems I
&gt; cant remember wich end of the tubes go toard the heat exchangers. I do recall
&gt; the longer tube being on the passengers side

Correct.

&gt; and that I couldn't seem to get
&gt; them out til I pulled the engine. I have tried to compare to my 75 bus but
&gt; they are quite different.

Suggestion. If you are unsure which ends connect to the engine see which end
the seals fit into. Perhaps the part numbers are printed on the engine side
like the baywindow versions? I don't own a Vanagon but I own one on TV.
