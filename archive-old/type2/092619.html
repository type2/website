&gt;Permatex #2: not good.  Super Weatherstrip Adhesive..... good.

...I agree with Jim. 3M Super Weatherstrip Adhesive on the covers only is 
advised by Harry Pellow, the 356/912 Guru, and I have been using it 
exclusively for many years with no problems whatever. The problems I see 
with VC gaskets is they will shift about upon install, or swell and push 
themselves out of place. The adhesive is needed to keep them firmly in 
place. Hylomar will not do this, nor will Permatex. And there is no place 
on the whole frikin' machine for RTV.
