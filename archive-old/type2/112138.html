Subject: Champagne edition bus (any owners on the list?)

Hi,

As some of you might know I have a great interest in
M-codes and all the other info that can be derived
from the M-plate (paint codes, modelcodes, etc.)

I am now trying to figure out what the special models
looked like that VW produced in the late 70ties. As
far as I know only four exist:

- Champagne Edition I ('77)
- Champagne Edition II - microbus ('78)
- Champagne Edition II - Westfalia ('78)
- Silberfisch ('78)

The Silberfisch was a German model, the Champagne
Edition buses were sold only in the USA (and Canada
perhaps??). Here's a 1978 Champagne Edition II so you
know what I am talking about:

I would like to get in touch with owners of these
special models. So my question is:

   Is there anyone on the list with
   any of these buses?
   Or who knows owners that are not
   on the list but who like to get
   in touch with me?

I have already spoken to Dave C. Bolen about his bus,
but I'd like to get in touch with more people. Also
because it seems that the 1978 Microbus and Westfalia
seem to be completely different buses (different
colours for example).

I am particalarly interested in the M-plate but also
pictures on special details or any addition info is
welcome!

Thank you in advance,



Vincent
