Subject: [T2] gas tank

I am in the final stages of replacing the motor in my
72 westy.  To make a very long story short, the bus
has sat much longer than I ever expected and I put her
away wet, so to speak.  I figure that it would be best
to drain the fuel out of the tank.  If the gas that
comes out is normal looking, can I just refill the
tank and drive away?  should I treat the tank somehow.
 I once had to deal with a corroded tank in a
motorcycle, and it was a nightmare.  Any advice would
be appreciated.  Much thanks!

Kurt and Julie Rogers
