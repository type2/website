OK,  Michael, I'll bite.  ( Please don't set the hook to hard)  Why the
reference to
Kendall oil being Green?  Wouldn't the drop in oil temp. be related to the
chemical
make-up of Kendall oil?  Is Kendall oil a synthetic ?  Maybe thats why its
green.  I
don't know, I slept last night, got to start all over today.
