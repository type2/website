THE SCHMIDTS wrote to Dave in Coronado about:

As to any decal, no.  There is a plastic scale shaped like a fourth of a circle more or less that has &quot;o&quot; and several BTDC and ATDC increments marked...

-Correct on the plastic timing marker, buy my 76 does have a decal typical to type 1 engines with valve adjustment #'s and timing #'s on it on the passenger side of the fan housing.

The air pump on this engine has been disconnected from the exhaust
manifold, but is still mounted to the engine, and is connected by a
fan belt to a pulley that seems to be mounted to the center of the
fan.  The pulley doesn't turn with the fan - it seems to be
independent.  Can I remove all of the air pump related stuff without
difficulty?

-Sound like the smog pump typical to (73-74) only. If you don't need to pass smog, it shouldn't be tough to get rid of it, as it's a hokey second though system anyway.

The electric fan mounted in the top of the engine compartment.
does it have something to do with engine cooling?  Is it
thermostatically controlled?  Or is it only for passenger compartment
heating?

-The fan provides extra air to the heater boxes so that you have more than average heat pressure in the cabin at speed and more than no heat pressure in the cabin at idle. It has an inline fuse and a relay mounted on it.

How bout kicking down an extra bus for the help?
