Subject: I'm such a dork

I was just sitting here ticked off...

I got the GWB back together (everything except sealing the tin) and went to
start it. OIL light came on for only 2 cranks and went out. But I can't seem
to get it to start. It sounds like it really wants to, but nothing.

So I'm all mad and frustrated. And as I sit down to check my email Zeus
zapped me with a bolt of lightening... How about hooking the alt cable to
the starter STUPID.

heh

I hope that's it. :)
