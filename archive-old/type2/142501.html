Subject: Ignition Switch Replacement - HELP!

Hello good people! 

I am trying to finish an ignition switch replacement on a friend's '78 Riviera. I've done them before on my bus, Beetles, our Cabrio, etc. so no problems with how to do it. I've had it apart now 4 times but can't make it work. 

I took it apart and the big red wire connector was frayed after 2-3 attempts to reassemble it. Richard Atwell came through with an order of connectors that we split. Worked perfectly! Couldn't source them locally. With a new connector in hand I'm going to try again just to see if I can. 

Put it back together last night and when the switch (new from Bus Depot) is out of the ignition lock and I turn it with a screwdriver the bus starts immediately and normally. When the switch is screwed to the back of the lock it is as if the lock will turn 52 degrees and the point where the switch will send power to the starter is at 55 degrees. In other words the key switch won't turn far enough it seems. We've tried two Bus Depot switches. Same result. I don't have a used VW switch (OEM, vintage, used) to test or I'd do that. 

Questions: are these switches defective aftermarket switches whose engineer missed the contact placement by 3 degrees? &lt;grin!&gt; In other words anyone else use these switches with success?

Does the OEM ignition locks fail in such a way that their rotation is limited after wear sets in? The Riv in question only has a documented 75K miles on it. Of course the van could have been started and stopped 17 times a day but I doubt it (original motor, tranny, brakes but not pads). 

If I drill the housing and extract the lock is there a stop that I can file to give the lock more rotation without endangering the electrical switch by over rotation?

Thanks to all that ponder and answer these questions!
