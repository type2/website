Subject: RE: [T2] I learned a new word today

&gt;iatrogenic
&gt;
&gt;meaning, I think, &quot;Induced in a patient by a physician's activity, manner, 
&gt;or therapy. Used &gt;especially of an infection or other complication of 
&gt;treatment.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Now, how does this relate to our buses??  Can this describe  . . .

Hi Barry,

This sounds like a word to describe a D*mn Previous Owner.  Rather than 
saying &quot;The DPO ripped out all the FI and replaced with a Weber 
Progressive....&quot;  You could say, &quot;My '79 2.0 has an IATROGENIC single-carb 
induction system.&quot;  It'll make the guys scratch their heads down at the 
speed shop!

Or, engines that are chromed could be said to have been iatrogenically 
enhanced.

Fun with words!  Thanks!
