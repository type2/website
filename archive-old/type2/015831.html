&gt;I am looking for a spare 4 speed transaxle for my 75 bus. Would prefer
1975-1979 vintage.

Be careful, 75 transaxles are not the same as 76-79 transaxles.  75 is an
oddball 002, and 76-79 are 091's.  091's are 1/2&quot; longer in the bellhousing
and the transaxle itself (1&quot; total) and require different starters,
bellhousings, and flywheels.  The gear ratios are also different.  It can
be made to work, but you can't just swap one for the other directly.
