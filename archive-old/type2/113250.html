&gt;Hi Volks-
&gt;
&gt;Happy Friday!
&gt;
&gt;I was going to replace my coil today, but have hit a glitch: How can I tell
&gt;which is the negative or positive side of the coil? My new Pertronix coil is
&gt;marked with both a positive side and a negative side, and my old Bosch is not
&gt;marked. With the ignition on, both sides of the old coil read as positive.
&gt;Did I get the wrong kind of coil?

My Bosch coil has the negative symbol by the Terminal 1 marking. If there is no labelling at all you need to go by the wiring diagram. Find the coil wire going to the backup lights and the ignition switch and that will be positive.
