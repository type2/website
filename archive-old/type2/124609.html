X-Virus-Scanned: Symantec AntiVirus Scan Engine
Subject: Re: [T2] Engine removal/installation question

Early buses (up to and including the '71) had a removable &quot;apron&quot; so you
could just slide the engine out without jacking the bus up. From '72 on
there is no apron so you have to jack up the bus to clear the engine.

You said you removed the engine without jacking up the bus......if you have
a late bay and removed the engine without a lot of jacking up and down and
all around to get it off the spline you are a magician. If you have an early
bay (with the apron) than I can't think of any reason to jack up the engine
or bus as long as the spline lines up.

I assume when you wonder if you need to put it BACK up on the jackstands you
mean from another task and that you didn't have it lifted when you removed
the engine.

Here is a pic of the engine NOT clearing in my old 72, even with it jacked
up somewhat.

Yes I cleaned that oil up.

Hope this helps,
