&gt;A type IV is a
&gt;squareback, right? So does saying I have a type IV engine mean I have a
&gt;squareback engine in there? Or should it be that I have a Type II with a T4
&gt;engine? I've looked at a couple websites, but sometimes they contradict each
&gt;other.

Okay, this is the way it was explained to me:

Type numbers are Roman, and refer to different generations of Volkswagen.

	Type I -- Beetle

	Type II -- Transporter

	Type III -- Square, Fast, Notch

	Type IV -- Variant

Note that this doesn't have anything necessarily to do with engine type,
and that in most Volkswagen circles except ours, &quot;Type IV&quot; refers to the
411/412 Ghia sedan, known in America as the Variant. Type numbers are, in
the mind of Volkswagen AG, what were different advancing evolutions of
motorcar.

T-numbers are Arabic, and refer to different generations of BUS.

	T-1 -- Split Window

	T-2 -- Bay Window

	T-3 -- Vanagon/Caravelle

	T-4 -- Eurovan

Again, this has nothing in particular to do with engine type, and you
cannot assume anything about the engine in a particular bus from its
T-number unless you know the country it was marketed in, and maybe not even
then (in Britain, you could get a Vanagon with a Beetle engine in it if you
wanted, and even then somebody might have bored it out before you got it 8).

The most interesting thing about all these numbers is that as often as not,
people do it wrong, so even if you know the difference between a Type II
and a T-4 it won't do you much good. 8) It really is best to say &quot;I have an
1800 cc engine with hydraulic lifters and natural aspiration&quot; or whatever.
