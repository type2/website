&gt; Hi,

&gt; I see that the 68-72 and 73-79 use different steering boxes. Is the
&gt; later model retro-fitable to my '71?

Oh, if it only were!  Unfortunately, the later box has a larger &quot;neck&quot; and
won't fit on the early bus.  With enough welding it could be done, but
it's more than I would attempt.
