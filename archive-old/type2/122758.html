Subject: RE: [T2] Rebuild vs. LongBlock

Hi Volks- Let me preface this by saying that I am the worst mechanic on the
face of the earth.  CHECK THE WARRANTY and buy a long-block.  The engine
that I spent countless hours on lasted 2500 miles. That was in 1979. I am
the first one to say that if you have mechanical aptitude, go for it. I have
BTDT. I recognize my weakness. TBear
