Subject: Re: Anyone want a ride from seattle to ny?

Im sorry to take things personaly, but I guess you dont know me. I am
involved in a monogomous relationship (maybe you noticed that I didnt specify
a female rider, but no your dirty little mind was to busy formulating some
stupid sexist joke.) so dear 75112.2101, you can Kiss my tailpipe.  I simply
desire someone to split the cost of gas and chat with. Also to keep me from
driving ten hours without stopping (a bad habit of mine.) I thought that
someone who gets this lisrt might want/ need a ride to NY. Sorry that I like
to share my house with people who bathe. maybe this reqirement is to much for
you. 

I thought the new VW motto was &quot;Drivers Wanted&quot; not &quot;Assholes wanted&quot;. If im
right you have the wrong car.

Duncan

ps. I am not stupid enough to go looking for a date in a male dominated
medium (two actually, VWS and Nerdland).
