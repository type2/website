Subject: Re: [T2] Splittie profiteering

Robt,

Whatever the market will bear.  You obviously haven't been paying 
attention to splittie prices.

I have seen 21 windows in absolutely pristine shape going for much more 
than that....some have been advertiesed for over $30,000....and sold.

When you spend that kind of money, an engine rebuild is the least of your 
worries....pocket change actually.

On the baywindow side, I have noticed prices have started creeping 
up...especially for single and double cabs.


Cheers, dave

   This splittie would need to have a top rebuilt motor &amp; trans, and
  everything else fine, to be worth more than $10k, wouldn't it?   My guess is
  that the owner doesn't really want to sell it but figures that if a silly
  enough fool comes along who has just struck a jackpot, what the hell.
