Subject: Dual Kadrons, Breather and Charcoal Can ?

	So I've got my new Kadrons installed on my '73 1700, balance line 
tapped for brake booster,  linkage all figured out and I have them 
tuned/balanced nicely as well. She runs REALLY nicely. Temps are nice 
an low, she idles smooth, accelerates smoothly  and powerfully as well.

	During the install of the carbs, namely the taking all the 34pdsit 
gear out, I started wondering about my oil breather hose and my 
charcoal box hose ...

	In keeping with the original setup I tapped a hole in the filter on 
each carb and threaded in a metal tube to which I connected each of 
these hoses so they are venting/breathing into the air filter of the 
carbs. This seems to make sense to me, but its been on my mind for a 
few days now and I figured I would ask those of you who have gone down 
this road before, what did you do with these hoses ?

thoughts ?

Steve
