Very little if you're using the internal regulator alternator!  All you
need to do is bypass the voltage regulator.

The voltage regulator has two fat wires going to it.  These need to be
connected.  It also has two thin wires going to it.  These need to be
connected.  The thin brown ground wire may be left alone.

To connect the wires cleanly and maintain the ability to change back if
you need to, make some spade connetor adapters out of copper strip.  Don't
have any copper strip?  Get a scrap of copper pipe, cut a piece of it
lenghtwise with tin snips, and hammer it flat.

Slide a piece of plastic tubing over the wires, connect the ends with the
adapters, and slide the tubing over the adapters to insulate the
connections  These connections are always hot and not fused, so make sure
that they are securely insulated.

At the alternator end, you have to make an adapter to connect the screw
lug of the thin wire to the male spade terminal of the alternator.

The screw lug of the thick wire simply connects to the output post of the
alternator.  You may want to come up with a way to insulate this as it is
now always hot.

The brown ground wire connects to the ground screw on the body of the
alternator.
