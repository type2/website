Subject: Re: [T2] wired open heater boxes

Takes two or three hours to replace the cables.  You need to remove the heater control levers from the dash, take out the instrument panel, remove the pedal pan, remove the plastic caps at the end of the cable tubes near the heater boxes by pulling the tube with cap out of the hanger strap, remove the caps, take out the plastic pieces that slip over the cable, pull the old cables, run the new ones, reconnect everything, adjust the effective length at the barrel clamps on the heater box linkage.

It's just one of those jobs where it seems like you're working all ends of the bus at once.

&gt;Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;First, I just want to thank all of you who have so patiently answered my 
&gt;questions as I rebuild my bus.
&gt;
&gt;I'm getting ready to put my engine back in the bus, and I remember when I 
&gt;took it out, the heater boxes were wired to the frame in the open position.  
&gt;Why would the previous owner(s) do this?  Are hooking them back up to the 
&gt;dash levers a difficult job?
&gt;
&gt;thanks!
