Subject: Steering Column Removal?

Hello,

Unfortunately, I need to remove my steering column inorder to hook up the 
horn ground wire. The Bentley manual indicates that you need to remove the 
steering box, so that you can pull down the steering column. Is it not 
possible to pull it up into the cab or is to long? This would seem like less 
work.

Thanks in advance, Phil.
