Subject: Vanagon-Tire on Nose

Has anyone mounted a spare on the nose of a vanagon?  Z-Line web page
lists such an item but the only picture is on a loaf.  Just was thinkin'
it would be a good things for several reasons

looks cool
gives retro look
allows one to take two off road tires on vacation
extra crash protection
tire mounted bike rack can go on front
gives it that VW bus look

Alright! I really want a bay deep down inside!  You just had to force it
out of me - didn't you!?

Air Cooled Vanagon Owners get no respect 
(from the Bay / Split crowd or the H20 Vanagon crowd)
