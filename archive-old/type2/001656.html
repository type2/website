Rich,

     I raised both my kids in the back of Type II's.  The seatbelts are fine
as long as there are no fraying or tears.  Make sure the carseat is as tight
as you can get it against the seat.

&gt; hi all
&gt;
&gt; Just a question;  has anyone put a car seat in the back of a westy?  My
&gt; wife and I just had our first child (Alexis), and I want to take her for
&gt; her first ride in the camper.  She is a little nervous about the seatbelts
&gt; in the back, I think they work fine. Any advice?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
