Subject: Shipping middle seat?

OK volks, here's the deal:

I've got a powerful hankering for a 3-passenger middle seat for my
'71. I've discovered someone who wants to part with one.  Only problem
is that we live on opposite sides of the great US (Maryland,
California).  

Anyone out there with any experince shipping such an item?  I'm
thinking refrigerator box, but wanted to check the list to see if
anyone had done something this foolish before.  I'd hate to see a
relatively rare middle seat go on a scrap pile.
