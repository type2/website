Subject: not wurth it

while screwing with the case today, i decided that anerobic sealants 
were crap. at least wurth's is!  sold to me by one of the alleged 
'reputable' shops here as da schnizzle in da hizzle, it ran me $20. 
the OTHER shop in town, of course, rolled their eyes and sighed. no 
good, they carped.
anyways, i had a go with it this morning; as you may recall, i had to 
reopen the case and track down a pinch. well, this resulted in an 
HOUR of scraping hardened orange goo of both mating surfaces with a 
razorblade!  maybe 10 minutes had passed, but the stuff had tuned 
into a whitish, fibrous film that STUCK. the places i used permatex 
on wiped off with a rag soaked in brake cleaner.

moral of story: if you are a pro who never makes mistakes, use the 
orange goo. otherwise, use permatex and unwaxed dental floss (gonna 
try that one tomorrow).
