Volks,

Looking to purchase the oil filler top, that bolts to the oil breather top on 
Type 4 engines.  Would really like the whole breather can, but if you just 
have the plastic filler top, that would be great too.  I am putting a 411 
engine into my '73 Sunroof and have access thru the engine hatch panel, but 
the breather top that is currently on there has to be completely removed to 
pour oil into the engine.... me thinks that I would soon be needing to stock 
up on breather box cork gaskets.... so, the request.

I know they exist... was just at a junkyard and saw one on a '73 hardtop 
Westy..... CB engine, with engine hatch, so seems a little unusual.... Would 
have gladly bought it from the owner of the junkyard, but it comes with the 
complete bus....$800.... and me thinks that is just a bit too much to pay for 
a oil filler top/breather box.....

By the way... there were three Westy's there, the '73 hardtop (orange), a '74 
poptop, light blue over dark blue, blue/green checkerd cloth, and a '77 
poptop, with the fridge and the green/yellow checkerd cloth... older 
gentleman there said they are his son's and the son wants $800 each...  they 
are in fair shape, would need quite a bit of work to get presentable, and 
closer inspections might reveal lots more wrong... but the canvas looked in 
good shape, a lot of the cloth looked good.... $2400 might get you a good 
Westy....
