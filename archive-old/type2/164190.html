Hi gang,

 

Well, my bus is running pretty well as before.

 

On a grade hill either I have to rev her up to 100 kph as I am coming up to
it, or drop into 3rd gear.

 

I guess the Pressure test will reveal more.

 

The lifters were only clacking about as long as #3 clacks on a long term
cold start.

 

My battery took more than 8 amps to charge last night.

 

Gave the engine a long idle to let the lifters lube up.

 

I guess I am close to where I was before with engine.
