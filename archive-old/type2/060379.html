Hey folks,
Here's the next question I've got.  Can you believe that my '78 has never had
a radio installed!?!  I am about to purchase one, but what I would like to
know is: does anybody have any clever suggestions for speaker placement?  I am
not sure where exactly to put them, and of course I hate to permanantly
install a mistake!!!

Thanks!
Brian out
