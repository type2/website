Subject: Vanagon westy skylight/sunroof dimensions

Can anyone provide me with the measurements of
the vanagon westy skylight/sunroof.  Some one put
a sunroof in my westy poptop and I'm trying to
decide if it's from jcwhitney or its ilk or
perhaps a stock late vanagon westy component. 

Thanks,
Ray
