&gt; &gt; really awkward location, and you will drown in gas when you change it if
&gt; &gt; you are not real carefull.    (I put shut off valves on mine for changing
&gt;
&gt; BTW: Quick tip for the rest of us who haven't got around to Bob's very
&gt; sensible move of installing a valve, carry a Golf Tee in your tool box or
&gt; glove box, they slide into the fuel line and stop it up quite well.
&gt;
&gt; NB: Don't know about the tar mix in the States, but I got reminded at
&gt; Christmas that petrol (gas) will do a wonderful job of dissolving the tar
&gt; here in Oz, changing the filter on the street took me 10 minutes, scrubbing
&gt; the tar out of my hair and skin took something over 1/2 hour :o(

yeah USA gas and tar disolve the same...
