Subject: RE: [T2] Friday Rookie Question about Valve Cover Gaskets

1) Use cork gaskets, if you didn't.  busdepot_dot_com has
them, as do many other VW stores.

2) Clean out the groove in the valve cover, and use
some sort of gasket glue. If you don't glue them in,
they will likley misalign and leak like a mofo.

3) Make sure the bails are tight...it should be almost
impossible to remove them by hand.  These can replaced
chaeply too.


I only replace the gaskets when they start to crumble
or leak, not every valve adjustment.  Hopefully the
sealing surface on the head is pretty smooth...if not
it might need to be machined to get a good seal..
Actaully mine aren't that smooth, but my bails are
VERY tight.
