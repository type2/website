&gt;When letting out the clutch a chirping and scratching sound is heard. When

&gt;Here are some questions.
&gt;Anybody wanna offer a second opinion on my self-diagnosis?

Could also likely be the pilot bearing.

&gt;Should I pull the tranny and just replace the bearing or pull the engine and
&gt;do some regular maintenance stuff while I am in there?

I can't answer that one for you.

&gt;Should I pull both as a unit. (this option might involve buying a keg and
&gt;inviting list members over to help:)&gt;

Both as a unit, but remove the exhaust first.
