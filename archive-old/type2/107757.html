Subject: Re: [T2] misfiring and running rich

First, check your electric choke heater element to see if it is working
properly. It should warm up and open your choke plate. The wire may have
come loose, the element may have burned out, or the choke plate may be stuck
and not opening freely.

&gt;   Well, coming home on Easter, my bus started misfiring ... she seems to
be running very rich
&gt;  I am cringing at the thought of bringing it to the shop with my tail
&gt; between my legs.   Not to mention here in Vermont there are not too many
who
&gt; will service such things.
