Hear, hear!! 

I would wager that installing decent stereo in a bus would also be a major
mechanical coup, given the tendency toward clanks and rattles to start
with!!

I had a butt kicking good system in a &quot;real&quot; bus (i.e. a school bus) many
years ago, but I'd hate to try to get that kind of bottom end, excellent
stereo imaging, etc in the closer confines like my Westy.  I'd just be
rattling the tin!!
