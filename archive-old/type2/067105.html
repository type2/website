Subject: New P/C question

My '74 bus has the 1800 cc engine. I am looking at doing a 
top end rebuild within the next 6 mos and I was wondering 
about what options I have. I *seem* to recall reading sometime
that it was easy to change the 1800 to a 2000 but I cannot
remember where I read that. Can someone fill me in either way?

Also, I have not had any (knock on wood) head problems,
so should I even worry about them When I have them out?
I am pretty sure that this 145,000 miles are all on the
origonal engine and heads, so I am abit weary.
