Subject: Rap on Distributors #2 (Jose's bus)

The second bus I looked at was also an early (68-70) bay, owned by a
member of the FMBC, named Jose. He had no initial complaint, he was just
generally worried.

The history as I got it was that the bus had been sitting for quite a
while and he had just pulled it out of the weeds and gotten it running.
Good job, Jose!!!!!

Checked his dwell, which was within limits (~46 as I remember) and timing,
which was also OK.  He had a stock pulley, which had two notches and it
lined up with the one I remember as being the 7.5 VOR notch, so if he has
hte right puley, his timing was fine.  I recommended, as I usually do,
that he get degree wheel pulley.

Note on pulleys: VW put so many different pulleys on engines, and so much
swapping has gone on, that at this point the cheap, sleezy looking &quot;billet
look&quot; degree wheel pulleys are really the only way to go :-(  I hate them
for appearances sake, they are truly non-stock, but I no longer trust any
pulley to report facts to me.  Bummer :-(

Lastly, his fan belt was as loose as a politicians tongue, which is not a
pretty sight on the podium and worse in the engine bay of a bus.  All
standing around agreed this was a &quot;bad thing&quot; and I am hoping he replaced
it soon (he had a new one in the bus)  I believe the reason it was lookse
was that  his pulley was &lt;euphemism&gt; quite rusty &lt;/euphemism&gt; from sitting
as lng as it had.  If it were mine, I'd have sanded the heck out of the
groove with some 220 grit sandpaper bfore installing the new belt.
