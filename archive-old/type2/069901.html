No wonder I have so much trouble gettin push starts from passers-by,
nothing to hold on to :-)

&gt; You do not have overriders because, by God, you have a sense of decorum. ;)

That does it! I want a set for the '73!  BusBoys, are you listening?  or
must I get a machine shop to carve up a set off an old barn door? :-0

Because if there is one thing I absolutely do not possess, it is a sense
of decorum! :)
