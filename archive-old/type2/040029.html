Subject: New Bus!

Hello dubbers,
	Well, Nanooks body was so rotted, we looked for, and found, a new body.  It
is a '73 Westy Deluxe!  How lucky I got it for $350.  It only has a bad
battery tray and some surface rust in the door area.  Why is it a Deluxe
(I'm guessing here)?   Well, it has a locking engine door, and has all the
acoutrements except the stuff that has dissapeard over the years.  I even
have the frame for the cot, just no canvas.
	Anyway, the interior is in such great shape, I am going to leave it alone.
I as going to put in a Vanagon westy interior, but I just can't do it.  Sure
it won't have a real fridge or a stove, but I can live with that.  I have
fallen in love with this interior.  What a dork, right?  I have a problem,
though.
	Nanook will need to go to someone with the ability to do good and loving
body repair.  I understand that I will never be able to sell her without an
engine, however.  SO!  I am looking for an engine.  It doesn't need to be
recently rebuilt, but I would like it to be a 2L.  Also, since the new baby
is an auto, I would like the FI, too.  I would get a newly rebuilt engine,
but I simply don't have the $1500-$1800 bucks to slap down.  I would rather
have a not-quite tired engine that will survive a summer of driving before
needing to be rebuilt, but will need to be rebuilt.
	If anyone out there, preferably on the West Coast, has a cheapish 2L FI
they are willing to sell to a bus that will be a real beaut when finished,
please mail me.  I really wanna go campin' this summer!
	Oh, and I know this is a lot to ask, but I have to.  The bottom of the bell
housing on my auto tranny is broken, so it will be only held on the engine
by 3, instead of 4 bolts.  I am therefore tentatively looking out for a new
(meaning different) auto tranny.  It would make my summer if someone out
there has both and engine and auto tranny together they are willing to part
with, but I am not holding my breath on that one.
	Thanks in advance, you people are great, I mean this has to be the best Web
community on the internet!

Sincerly,

Daniel Cathey III
