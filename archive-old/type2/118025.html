Subject: Re: [T2] foam under gas tank?

In a message dated 5/5/03 1:32:53 AM, Bookwus1_at_aol_dot_com writes:

&lt;&lt;  However, you can (and should) use reticulated foam in most 
automotive applications.  This stuff is resistant to moisture and will allow 
any moisture to pass right through it.  Absolutely perfect for use in doors 
(like behind the interior door latch handles) and I imagine it would fit the 
bill for your application should you decide to go that way.  And it's 
available in Portland. &gt;&gt;
