Subject: where's da heat?
Mime-Version: 1.0

good morning to all of ya,

i decided to make a list of various parts to order last night.  so, bearing 
the cold, i laid under the bus in an attempt to find out what was missing 
from the heating system.

so, i'm pretty sure the flappers are rusted/frozen shut.  the po told me 
the heat wasn't functioning all that well....by the looks of it, not at 
all.  my main question was....(drum role please)...does anyone have a 
sketch of what the tubes are supposed to look like?

i've got 2 vents from the flappers, i can only assume one is a blow by when 
the heat is off (there is no connection currently) and the other is 
connected to a tube that connects with the main shaft in the center of the 
body.  from there, i only have a tube to the front of the bus.

i have a vent in the rear bench/bed seat and at the threshold line that 
separates the driver/pass. from the rear.  where are these fed from?  (no 
tubes again.)

also, how many lines are there to the defroster/floor in the front?

i couldn't find in any catalogue the main heater tube that runs the length 
of the bus.  mine is cracked and duct taped.  i appears that some dillhole 
jacked the bus up in several places not meant to be jacked.  so, this tube 
became a bit crushed in the process.

in addition to that, i'm going to attempt to get the a/c running 
again....does anyone have any schematic of this as well?  the compressor in 
the engine compartment is missing, but the radiator/condenser/dash unit are 
all in place.

thanks for all of you input!

missy:)
