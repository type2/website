Hey there Gary,

I asked this exact question about a month ago (except I was looking
for mexico beige - LE1M).

Here's what people told me. Some vendors (busdepot) have *some*
factory paint in spray cans. Some touch up paint is only available in
the small brush-on bottles.

You best bet is to go to your local auto paint supply store and have
them match the existing paint on your bus. One of the local places
should be able to mix up an exact match and put it in spray cans.

I haven't done this yet, but plan on calling around and see who can
mix the paint and then bring in my engine hatch, so they can match
that.

If you do find someone in the MA/RI area please let me know. It is on
my list of things to do, just isn't a high priority right now.

Hope this helps,
