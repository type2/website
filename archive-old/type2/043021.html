Well,

He said he had a pop-top 70 bus.  I believe most 68-73 or so westies with
poptops were built on sunroof bus shells without the sunroof.

So converting a 68-73 westy to a sunroof is a bolt on affair, and easy to
do.

BUT, converting any other bus without the double walled roof to a sunroof
bus would be a PITA and not worth it as far as im concerned.

take care,
