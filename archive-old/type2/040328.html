Subject: 70 Westy-FIRE-in the engine compartment-Replacing main wiring harness

Hi,

We had a rod go (in pieces) through the top of the engine case ( at #3 ).
It bounced over the fan shroud, sliced .through the plastic in line fuel
filter between the fuel pump and the carb.  Engine compartment caught fire
immediately.  We made a good stop on the fire, with too small extinguishers.
But, the battery was still connected and before it could be disconnected,
the wiring harness fried all the way from the engine to the front at the
fuse box.

Have replaced the engine and most of the wiring around it, and now,must
replace the main wiring harness.  Has anyone replaced this main wiring
harness?  Is it pretty much, cut the old harness, and somehow use it to pull
through the new one then reconnect the wires according to the wiring
diagram?

Any ideas, suggestions, or step by step instructions would be very much
appreciated
I checked the archives, and library,didn't see anything on 70.
