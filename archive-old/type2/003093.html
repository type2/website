I need to buy a new battery for our 71 bus.

My understanding is I should get a group 42.  In California cold cranking
amps might not be so important but reserve is.  Right?  How long a reserve
can I get?

Interstate 42-50 has a reserve of 71.  Napa NBR8442 has a reserve of  80.
Is this a significant difference?

Any other suggestions?

I have had trouble searching the web because most of the sites want you to
start with your vehicle and group 42 is not what they suggest for a  71 VW
bus.

Sorry if this is repetitive, the archives seem to be down tonight.

Lloyd
