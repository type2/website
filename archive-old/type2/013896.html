Subject: Re: [T2] Rocker arm lubrication



&gt; Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; Thursday evening, I responded to a question on how the rockers get 
lubed
&gt; with the answer that they are basically splash lubricated.  The 
following
&gt; p-mail from Robb chased me down to the basement to look at some parts 
I
&gt; have down there in boxes.

&gt; &gt; Steve, actually, the pushrods are hollow for a reason. If you look 
at
&gt; &gt; the lifters, solid or hydro, you'll see that they also function as a
&gt; &gt; pump. While some oil is &quot;flung&quot; from the crank, the vast majority of
&gt; &gt; oiling to the rockers comes from the before stated pumping of the
&gt; &gt; lifters, thru said push rods. This oil is also under a fair amount 
of
&gt; &gt; pressure, as the smaller diameter of the pushrod tube has an
&gt; &gt; amplifying effect. Robb

A minor nit-pick:

No pressure amplification occurs here.  Pascal's law and all that...

Not much pressure is required, since the flow rate is low and all the 
oil has to do is lube the rockers.  No high speed bearings here.

The passages in the rockers can get clogged, so disassembly and 
cleaning of the rocker assemblies should be part of any rebuild.  I 
experienced a _very_ clogged set of rockers on a rebuilt I bought from 
Mark Stephens two business names ago.  Seems as if they just grabbed 
them off of the pile and slapped them on the engine.
