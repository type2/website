Subject: Re: [T2] On a hunt for used 74 parts. (help me get to HCBF cont.)

Jay,

Be cheap on a lot of things, but *NEVER* on the seal!!!!

Sorry about the yelling(first time ever), but it 
is probably the most important item in your engine compartment.

Go buy one at the local vwflaps.  I paid $20 for my last one.

That seal is what is keeping your engine from absolutely burning up.
It keeps your engine from breathing superheated air straight off of the 
muffler and trying to use it to keep cool with.


Cheers, dave

&gt; I'd like to take my 74 to the upcoming High Country Bus Festival, but it 
&gt; needs a couple things before I could confidently drive it to the corner 
&gt; store, much less from MD to NC.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) The piece of tin that goes right in behind (FIF) the cooling fan.  It's 
&gt; the closest piece to you, and right in the center if you are looking in the 
&gt; engine compartment from the rear deck lid.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Air cleaner(s).  My dual carbs are naked.  I think they are just the 
&gt; normal little round stock solex ones.  I use an oil bath kind on my typeI 
&gt; and I like that alot since it's re-usable and cheap (like me!).  Do they 
&gt; make those for the bus?
&gt; 
&gt; If your in MD we can save some shipping.  UGLY but useable and cheap is just 
&gt; fine by me, I am looking for function not form here for my people mover (for 
&gt; now).  I also don't have the foam seal that goes between engine and body.  
&gt; Can I live without it?  Can I just cut up an old matress or something?
