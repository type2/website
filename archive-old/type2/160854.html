Subject: My front end saga begins (long)

Hi,

The following is a report on some front end work and observations I've
made recently.

About two weeks ago on the way to a gig, loaded down with my drums,
our bassist and his equipment, and a passenger I was making a u-turn
and bumped a curb going slowly (less than 5mph). This bump had the
undesired effect of severely bending my right side (adjustable)
tie-rod. By severe I'm talking about 5&quot;-6&quot; of deflection from a
straight line. I parked the bus in the bassist's driveway (luckily it
happened right in front of his house), find alternate transport and
get to the gig on time.

I think I should note here that before this incident I had previously
noticed that this tie-rod already had a very slight bend in it. Take
note folks that a slightly bent tie-rod can become a severely bent tie
rod with a &quot;minor&quot; bump at slow speeds.

The next day I ordered a replacement tie rod and pulled the bent one.
I also did a visual inspection of the entire front end/steering system
and didn't find any other apparent damage from the hit, but I do
discover the the lower ball joint boots are completely shot and will
soon be in need of replacement. The day after that I get the new tie
rod in, do a rough adjustment, and I'm off and rolling again.

So for the past two weeks I've been driving along without any major
issues, she steered straight, holds a line well, and no problems
turning. I do notice a little bit more wheel noise than normal,
especially going around fast turns (like highway on-ramps), leading me
to believe that my rough toe-in &quot;job&quot; wasn't too great.

So yesterday I climb under the bus with the intention of getting a
better toe-in. I find a novel tool to assist me - an adjustable
microphone stand. Works great, using Muir's technique for measuring
toe, except instead of using two pieces of wood I've got a great
adjustable locking rod. I get the toe-in set much better than by going
by &quot;feel&quot; alone. I had her toed in too much.

So while I've got the entire front end up I decide its time to go over
the steering again. Have an assistant turn the wheel back and forth.
Everything looks good from underneath but my helper notices a slight
drag at one point during the rotation, and while turning one way.
Hmm..I start thinking the worst - that it might be time to start
looking for a new (ie rebuilt) steering box.

I take her down off the stands and out for a test drive. Steering is
feeling a little looser than before. She's driving straight but every
time I hit a bump she wants to pull to the right. Also, she's getting
pushed around a lot more by the wind.

Perhaps the pulling is brake or bearing related, although she doesn't
pull at all while braking, I did notice some drag on the front wheels
while turning them with the bus jacked up.

What might cause a front disc brake to drag? I've already replaced all
the rubber brake lines, and done a full system bleed.

I guess I'm slightly overwhelmed now, unsure of exactly what is wrong,
as looking to determine where to go from here.

So here's my plan. I'm going to fix the parts I know need attention
first, then move down the list:

** Figure out and fix whatever is causing the front wheel drag
** Replace ball joints with the ball joint/torsion arm combo kit
(http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/bbbjarms2.htm)
** Professional alignment job (even though I dread anyone but me
working on the bus - don't see any way around this one)
** Center center steering box/wheels via drag link adjustment, check
drag link for wear
** Check swing level for play (not sure exactly how to do this yet),
replace center pin/bushing if necessary
** Replace steering damper (still got OE one there, easy enough to do
while I'm down there)

Then after all of the above have been addressed I'll see if I still
may need a new steering box.

What have I overlooked or left out? Certainly some of these updates
might be best done all at once. Any strategic recommendations?

On the plus side while I was down under the front end I discovered and
addressed a number of other issues:

Clutch cable was improperly routed, rubbing against the head of a
bolt. Clutch chatter problem fixed. Wow, what a difference a
centimeters makes.

Front vent line on the brake booster totally shot. 35 year old braided
hose had a huge hole in it right where it connects to the front of the
booster. Replaced with 5/8&quot; (I believe) rubber line. Unfortunately I
couldn't get a tube down into the booster via the front vent line to
drain anything that had possible gotten in but I did manage to get a
drain line in rear of the booster and...

Drained about a pint of cream soda colored fluid out of the brake
booster. That can't be good. Torn diaphragm? Seemed to have solved my
brake pedal return issue from about a month ago. I'll be monitoring
the brake fluid level very closely to see what happens over the next
few weeks. I was experiencing a bit of fluid consumption before the
rubber lines were replaced but none since. Could there be a
correlation between old rubber brake lines and the brake booster
filling with fluid?

Sorry for the extra long post but it's been a fun and exciting weekend
for me and my bus. I would love any comments from all you fine folks
who keep our beloved wheels turning.

peace

Oh, I also ended up adding a new electric windshield washer pump. It's
still on the bench and I'll save the details for another post once its
all installed and working.
