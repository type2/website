Subject: Re: [T2] Hagerty Insurance 

I put mine away for the winter as I will no longer
expose it to salt water, so my mileage is smallish
these days.  FWIW, here in Massachusetts there is
a &quot;low mileage&quot; (&lt;8K/yr) discount; doesn't amount
to much but it's universally available.

Never thought to look at &quot;antique&quot; insurance or,
for that matter, &quot;antique&quot; license plates.  I am
immune to emission testing, however.  Rhode Island
is no different so far as I can tell (I've got the
option of either).
