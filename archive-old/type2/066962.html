Subject: Where you live?

 Where you live: 
        Raleigh, North Carolina--well really the city is called Cary, but
it is close     enough to Raleigh that I drive there every day for
school
 What is you van:       
        '71 Passenger Bus - brown and white when I got it last year, now
it has          rainbows, and flowers, and skies, and a brick wall
and a fish on it...when it      gets warmer, it will be painted sky
blue with clouds on the front, and navy         blue with stars on the
back and they will blend in the middle
        '70 Kombi - blue, rusted, and doesn't run, used only for parts
 What is your name:
        Dallas Smith - sometimes I just go by Sallad - my nickname (and
liscence        plate)
 What is the name of your van:
        The one I drive is named Sky.
        The parts bus is called Big Blue.
 What is the URL for your home page:
        http://www.webbuild_dot_com/~sallad   (i think, i can't get on www
anymore so i    don't know if it is still up or if the address is
right, plus it hasn't been      updated since last year)
How old are you:
        I'm 18, but I have wanted a bus since I was 12, does that count
for giving      me extra age?
Give me your suggestion!!
        Great idea, good luck!
