&gt; I have looked at these things for years, and never found any real proof that
&gt; they work. But I have found one thing, They do not hurt anything either. So,
&gt; they may be a waste of money for no improvement, but they will not destroy
&gt; your engine or make the doors fall off.

This is true...but if you're going to spend twenty bucks on improving your
Bus's fuel economy, put it into spark plugs, points and condenser if you've
still got those, maybe an air filter if you're not running an oilbath.

Or go get a video with some Buses in it...IIRC, Cheech &amp; Chong's Next Movie
has a couple of shots of 23-window Buses in it.
