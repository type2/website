Subject: RE: [T2] Bus insurance

[...]

I just read the fine print on the Condon and Skelly insurance. It said annual mileage limited to 2,500 and no driving to work, school or shopping.  I can live with the 2500 but I'd hate to have an accident in a shopping center and find myself without any liability coverage.

Anybody know of any insurance policies that aren't so conservative yet offer a low rate for antique cars?
