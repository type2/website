Subject: choke valve shaft???

Good day guys,

Well, it was a bit cold this morning and i think i have a choke
problem!!! (even when it’s around 75F outside I need to hold the gas
pedal for 10-20 seconds, is ti normal!!!!!!!)
Not that difficult to start but I have to keep my foot on the pedal for
at least 20-30 second!!!! Before it barely hold constant (but low) idle.
Idle gets OK after a minute or two.

I read the Bentley (i have the 2 Solex 32-34-PDSIT) and I didn't found
much info as what to check or verify, they talk about greasing the
“choke valve shaft” if choke doesn’t work but I am unable to locate this
one in the Bentley!!!

I see the heating element (test OK) but if you could give me a few hints
about what to check so I can have an acceptable high idle at start when
cold.

I have the Bentley so you could refer to pages in this one. (page, step,
number)

Maybe I am missing something. Any help would greatly appreciated.

Many thanks, Ben from Montreal
