Subject: RE: [T2] Re: Update on 78 FI with Pertronix not starting

I'm going from memory re conversations with Petronix techs, but I believe the
standard ignitor is used with a standard (internally or externally resisted)
coil.  The Ignitor II is the one that can be run with the hotter coil.
All Petronix units are not created equally, I got one for a Willys pickup I
restored for a guy and as we were crusin on a test drive it died.  I had
switched the electrical to 12 volt and the unit for the truck was designed for
6 volt and a resisted coil, the unit was designed to operate off of 4.5 volts-
120$ boo boo.  I ended up taking a VW ignitor and mounted it on the Willys
plate with the Willys magnet ring, ran like a champ.JT Beaufort, SC Running:
