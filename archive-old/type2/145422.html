Subject: Re: Re: [T2] Wretched Running Bus

Yeah, I wasn't sure. I didn't see the whole thread so I didn't know what he had.

My issue might have been different. The fuel pump was an electric one and was installed right next to the motor. The part that was porous wasn't the part AFT of the fuel pump, but before. So the pressure wasn't an outward one, but an inward one. I know there's got to be a fancy term to say what I just tried to explain! heheh..

So it was basically sucking in air along with fuel. I could even see that the fuel filter was only maybe half-full too. When I switched to steel lines, the fuel filter didn't have so much as even a single bubble in it.

&gt; Hi Todd,
&gt; 
&gt; A fuel injected bus (the stock system in North America from 1975  
&gt; onwards) runs the fuel lines at 25-30PSI. If the lines get porous  
&gt; then it would quickly become a sprinkler system. A very HOT sprinkler  
&gt; system.
