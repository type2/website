&gt;All three placed via the website.  Received e-mail acknowledgement later
&gt;that same day for each.  Each arrived in 4 days.  Each complete (except
&gt;Hoover's Sermons CD which was BO, shipped separately and took about two
&gt;weeks), correct, undamaged.

Slightly different subject, if your copy of the Sermons gets backordered,
please blame me instead of Bus Depot because I often let Ron run out of
disks. It takes quite a while to cook up a batch doing them in the kitchen
sink like we do.
