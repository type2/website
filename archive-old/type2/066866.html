&gt;This is very silly but when looking at the cover of the brochure mine

&gt;the gas cap.  I know everyone has seen this on real busses but can
&gt;someone check out their brochure and see if this is not a figmant of my
&gt;imagination.  Kind of strange!

Well, I pulled out a '77 West manual and it looks the same, rust line (or
spilled gas line) and all, hmmmmmmm,  those sloppy Krauts!
