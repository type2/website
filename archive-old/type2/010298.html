I went out to do my first ever tune up by myself this afternoon. I got 
as far as adjusting the point gap and disaster hit. The van won't start.
I made a first adjustment but only got 40 degrees dwell (van started and
ran fine), so I went back in, made another adjustment. But then when I
started it, it turned over, ran for a few seconds, then stalled. It
wouldn't start after that.

I ran through Muir but nothing seems to work.

Any suggestions?

Sigh.
