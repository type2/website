Sorry to &quot;waste bandwidth&quot; but, I lost the addy of a site that I really
enjoyed....I believe it ended with &quot;.ni&quot; or in  or someting like
that....it had a nifty picture on the left side as a menu bar....it also
had information on how to contact VW or Germany...stuff for the VIN and
stuff like that....anyways...if someone could help me out!

Oh yeah....while I'm wasting bandwidth....anyone want to buy a 76 Honda
motorcycle?? its in good condition...needs a new seat and thats
all....its a 1976 Honda CB500
Dark red......its in Wisconsin.....make me an offer

TIA!
