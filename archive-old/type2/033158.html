Subject: Where, oh where is the air getting in?

Guys,
Recently I installed a million mile air filter in my bus. While I was
installing it, I put my hand over the air intake nozzle, with the engine
running, and it didn't stop the engine! If I do this with my Ford, the
engine quits immediately! I took a look, but I couldn't see where the air
was getting in! Is there another intake somewhere?

I'm puzzled!
