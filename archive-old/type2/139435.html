I  think you misunderstand the distinction I'm trying to make, Tim. 
There's no &quot;candidate&quot; and whoever would do this would have to create 
the market for it, not &quot;find&quot; a ready-made market. Moreover, the 
business plan I'm suggesting would not apply to refurbishing &quot;several&quot; 
of anything but perhaps a hundred, two hundred buses a year.

Tony probably identified the fatal flaw in the concept: manufacturer's 
liability.
