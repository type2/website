Subject: Gears not engaging- help!

Hi, I have a '69 bus with a '71 engine.  The engine &amp; clutch are brand new,
along with release bearing, and clutch operating shaft.  I can shift into
gears with the clutch engaged or disengaged.  When in gear the rear wheels
do not lock like they're suppose to.  Also, when bus is running in gear &amp;
rear wheels are off the ground you can stop the rear wheels from turning
with your hands.  I can't figure out what's wrong. : (

Any help will be greatly appreciated.
thanks,
Keri
