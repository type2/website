&gt;This site present to you the north america map, where all the members of 
&gt;the type2 mailing list are registered.

Beautiful site Jean! It is now a link on my links page!

You have included a hospitality and comments section -- what sort of

would you like for these? (Maggie and I would be hospitable to anyone coming

Las Vegas!)

Good Job!
