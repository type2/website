&gt;The master cyliner has to be disconnected before removing the brake

&gt;Anyone know what that hose on the front part of the brake servo is for
&gt;or what it goes to? it seems to dissapear into the side of the bus by
&gt;the driver's side door...

It's possible to remove the servo without removing the master cylinder, but
it's very difficult.  Try turning the wheel to move the steering linkage
out of the way.  The hose in front of the servo is an air vent hose for air
going into the servo.
