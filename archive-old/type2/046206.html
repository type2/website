Subject: [T2] Parts Needed

Hello again:

I need two types of plugs that are used in the floor sheet metal of my 69
Westfalia.  The first is a screw type, phillips head, these go in under the
seats in the rear of the vehicle.   I estimate the diameter of the screw to
be about 1/2&quot; and it comes with two washers, one plastic and one rubber.
The second is like a little cork, this one goes in the groove directly
behind the drivers and passenger seat wall, and also on the floor under the
driver's side jalouise window.    I've tried VW dealers, Go Westy, Bus
Depot, Bus Boys, with no luck.   Anyone have any leads or these plugs to
sell?   I may have to end up going to Pick your Part, but my time is at a
premium lately, and I might not be able to make it.

Thanks.

Jason
