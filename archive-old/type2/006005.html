Subject: Any noise questions?/Memorial Day
Message-ID: &lt;01BEA81F.7574E440_at_ip18.triangle-park3.nc.pub-ip.psi_dot_net&gt;

A few of you (2,200 so far this month) have checked out the VW Heat, 
Noiseproofing, Rust Proofing pages on our site. Glad it is of service.

I am working through a major update to the pages. A number of questions 
have cropped up since the first version, the answers to which I will 
incorporate in the update.

If you have any un-answered questions about the techniques on the site, 
please forward them to &lt;VWupdate_at_bulley-helwett_dot_com&gt;. I won't answer them 
through e-mail, but will make sure the text/photos/diagrams/links to 
pornography clarify your query.

I'm on hiatus until the 8th of June, so no more substantive mail from me 
until then. Y'all have a great Memorial Day (US).

I try not to be too political in this forum, but I want to ask a small 
favor: spend a moment this weekend thinking (praying, if it is your fancy), 
for the hundreds of thousands men and women who laid their ultimate 
sacrifice at the alter of liberty, that we might be free. So many have 
believed in human liberty, and have paid in advance for our beautiful, 
sweet freedom.

Cheers,
