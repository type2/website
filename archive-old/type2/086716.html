Subject: Re: [T2] Acceptable speeds


David hit the nail on the head here. Best engine configuration I have had
to date is the 2.0 FI type IV. Putting one of these together right is not
cheap though. Heads are critical, you need to have them done by someone who
knows these heads and can replace the seats. Thats about 5 bills there. You
will probably want a good web cam to improve performance and head temps.
about 150-200. New pistons and cylinders 250-300. Balancing is extremely
important IMHO to a long lasting smooth running engine. Then theres quality
bearings and seals, good exhaust and heat exchangers. The list goes on.
Unless you have the skills or are willing to be patient and aquire them my
advice would be to buy a motor from Jake Raby or Boston Bob then do the
install yourself. You can transplant one of these 2.0 Type IV's into your
bus but it will require some mods including a late model tranny. Disc
brakes are a must as well.
     That said I would consider building a mild type 1 motor. Maybe 1776 or
even 1835. External oil cooler (full flow of course) dual carbs. Good
balancing, mild cam, good heads. Probably can be done for $1500. The list
is probably your best resource on motor tips. If you  really want to go
fast though you don't want a bus you want a sports car.

&gt;rebuild time.  I like David live in the Dallas area and will never be able

how
&gt;do I make my bus more suitable for the way that I drive?  Type IV?  V-6
&gt;Conversion?  Beefy Type I?

How fast do you want to drive?  One thing I can say for sure, if you want
to cruise at more than 60mph reliably, you are talking a big investment,
like in the neighborhood of $2k.  Probably best to sell the bus you have
and buy a 76-up bus with the 2.0 and Fuel Injection.  What's more, with the

'70 you don't even have disc brakes, and you really want to be able to stop

well if you're going to be driving that fast.  Sorry I don't have a more
pleasant answer.  :-/
