Hey fellow buggers,
I am a tool and die maker, for 15 years...

Just a thought about ez outs... DONT BUY CHEAP ONES !!!
When you have a broken stud, you can still do a wide variety 
of &quot;surgeries&quot; to remove it, such as heat, the welded nut, drill
&amp; tap left handed, or ez out.  But, if you break off an ez out,
(which happens much more often with cheap oriental ones)
then to quote the old proverb &quot;Houston, we have a problem&quot;
The best way to get a broken stud out, which has a broken ez out in
it is with an edm machine...which most people, and most machine
shops don't have.  Please, do yourself a favor, get good 
ez outs.

Certainly enjoy the list,
Joseph Delgado Sr.
