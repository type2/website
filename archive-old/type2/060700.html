Subject: checking oil cooler

I just finished mounting the heads on the 1776 which I'm rebuilding.  On to
all the tin and other top end items.

Part of the reason I'm doing a rebuild is that the engine was seeing oil
temperatures of 250 pretty regularly.  I would like to check the oil cooler
before re-installing it.  Is there a procedure for doing so?   I thought of
pouring solvent in one port and making sure it flows out of the other.  But
the thought of residual solvent diluting my oil has kept me from doing
this.

Anyone have a suggestion?

Thanks, Jack
