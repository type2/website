Subject: 73 For Sale.....still

Hello all!!

 Just to let everyone know, the 73 Westy is still looking for a home. She
looks great with no rust and a new paint job, her interior is fully
functional but could use some attention...(what female doesn't?), stout 1800
with a Webber carb, but no heat, needs those elusive flapper valve.

 She can be seen at http://my.treeway_dot_com/OKArt/

Asking $2500 or best offer, she needs to go to a good home soon!!!
