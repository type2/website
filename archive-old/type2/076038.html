Subject: Re: [T2] Back into Bays

Chuck,
Thanks for the reminder.  Plenty of that graffiti remover around here.  I'll
just sprinkle some around the DC to keep those nasty hexes away from it.

Just a memory jogger, the DC being &quot;hex protected&quot; sat in a field from '65 to
'94 where almost everything under the truck was used to keep something else
running.  With that being said, I didn't have any problem (physically,
emotionally, or otherwise) putting the truck into the condition as it currently
stands.
1960 Double Cab
'78 2L Hydraulic Type IV - rebuilt, balanced, larger valves &amp; converted to
Upright
'74 Thing IRS Trans - Beefed up big time by Rancho Performance
Stock height IRS conversion
'69 front Beam
'79 front disc brakes from torsion arms out + vacuum booster
'79 Rear Brakes
CIS Fuel Injection from '78 Volvo adapted to work with Type IV engine.
Not a single piece of metal was cut or mutilated to make this fit.  It could go
back to stock given all the proper parts.  With the exception of the trans work
and the machine work done on engine parts, everything was done by me.

I've run the DC all over SoCal, loaded, unloaded, up hills and down.  Yes it was
a lot of work.
Am I happy with it?  Absolutely.

Another side benifit of the conversion is that most FLAPS still carry parts for
a '79 Bus or '78 Volvo.  And there are MANY more of these in the junkyards
providing another source of parts.  I figure I might be driving my DC on a
regular basis long after many wisely start parking theirs in the garage for
preservation purposes.

Will I ever get my investment (both time and $$) out of it?  In the traditional
respects, no freeking way.  But as I look at it, I already have.  Between all
the work and the purchase of the original DC, I have about $7,500 into it.  My
wife was pushing me to buy a minivan around the time I got the DC.  Hmmmm.....
$7,500 and I have one heck of a fun vehicle and a functional one too.  Now if I
were to have bought that minivan, I was looking at about $25k or so.   I guess
that puts about $17K in the pot to cover my time spent working on the
conversion.  Not a bad chunk of change for having FUN on weekends and evenings
instead of watching &quot;Must Not See TV&quot;.

Last time I checked, I wasn't a Shaman, just having fun impersonating one :-)

&gt; &gt; Ouch!  Now I'm off looking for a spray can of hex remover.
