&gt; Hey y'all
&gt;  It being really nice when I got home I thought I'd pull the driveshafts
&gt;  and get ready to install the CV kits.  There's 24 Allen headed bolts
&gt;  holding them in place, with a 6mm head.  Got 21 of the 24.  What
&gt;  happened?  Simple.  I got cocky when the 1st came off the right side of
&gt;  the tranny with no complaint.  It was just past finger tight.  Tried the
&gt;  next one, same thing.  Tried the next one - strip!  I said some unkind
&gt;  words and tried the next one, again just past finger tight.  I felt so
&gt;  good about the just past finger tights I went ahead and stripped the
&gt;  remaining 2.
&gt;  
&gt;  I said more unkind words, then got out the Kroil and gave the remaining
&gt;  unstripped bolts a good cleaning and soaking (shoulda done that first
&gt;  huh?).  Tap the allen wrench in the remaining bolts, tap some more to
&gt;  gently break them loose and they all came out sweeter than maple taffy
&gt;  fresh from the boiler and poured on new snow.
&gt;  
&gt;  So I now have 1 driveshaft on the ground and another with 3 stripped
&gt;  allen head bolts on the right side of the tranny.  I soaked 'em all real
&gt;  good with Kroil and tapped a bit to loosen things up.  The closest
&gt;  larger American size doesn't quite fit in the stripped metrics, the next
&gt;  bigger metric don't fit.  I tried cutting a groove in the head of 1 of
&gt;  the offending bolts and tried the impact driver but that didn't work
&gt;  either, and so called it a day before I broke something else.
&gt;  
&gt;  Any suggestions from the list regarding the removal of reluctant
&gt;  stripped allen head bolts?
&gt;  

Hi Dave,

Usually these bolts are not Allen bolts but are M8 TRI-SQUARE. i.e. not a 
hexagon shaped hole but 3 squares each rotated 30 degrees from the adjacent 
squares. If you have Tri-Square bolts but used an allen key on them then the 
vastly reduced contact areas between tool and bolt can itself cause the head 
pattern to strip.

Having said that some people do have allen bolts in which case an allen key 
is the correct tool.

Torx doesn't fit properly either as that's a six point star.

These bolt head can get pretty grimy so it's always a good idea to clean the 
tri-square hole out to enable maximum contact between tool and bolt.

I use a M8 tri-square bit that goes on to my 1/2 inch socket sets. Most of 
the tools shops and car shops sale them in kits of three or four sizes.
I also use a wobble bar extension as that allows the ratchet drive to be non 
axial with the bolt without the floppiness of a universal joint.

To remove the remaining bolts do the following:
Ensure neutral gear is selected.
Securely chock the front wheels
Jack up the rear wheel 
take parking (hand) brake off 
turn wheel to get the offending bolt to an accessible position. do the gear 
box end of the drive shaft first
put parking brake back on
Fully lower the wheel back onto the ground 
Clamp (as tight as you can) a pair of long nosed vice grips onto the bolt 
head which should give you sufficient leverage to move the bolt.

If you only have bolts stuck on the transmission end of the drive shaft then 
it should be possible to grip and turn the drive shaft for access to the 
bolts (provided that neutral has been selected)

If there is only a stuck bolt(s) at one end of a drive shaft it may be 
possible to hack saw or drill the head off to remove the drive shaft giving 
you much more room to work with vice grips. Has any one tired this? is there 
room to remove the drive shaft this way?

Another thing to note is that the bolts should be done up to 25 foot pounds - 
I wouldn't be happy if the bolts on my bus were only finger tight. This is 
one place where I always use my torque wrench as under tightening could cause 
loss of drive and over tightening will damage the bolts (and make them hard 
to undo)
Doing this I've never had a single bolt come loose neither have I ever had 
difficulty removing the bolts the next time.

Also both Haynes and Bently manuals say that these bolts are use once only 
(that because they stretch and repeated use will cause them to grip less), 
and all the CV boot kits on sale here (UK) contain a full set of replacement 
tri-square bolts and a tube containing the correct amount of CV joint grease. 
It is possible to get the boots separately but then you have to supply grease 
and new bolts of the correct steel yourself which makes the boot kits very 
cost effective.

You say you have CV kits - do you mean boot kits or joint kits? If you have 
joint kits then I would strongly recommend changing the boots too as it's an 
awkward job to do (plus you have to remove the joint to remove the boot). I 
would also consider it false economy to replace the boot on just one end of a 
drive shaft.

Good luck
