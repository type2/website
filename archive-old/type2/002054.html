I was looking at improvements to BHP &amp; Torque. On the way back from Cornwall
earlier this year a friends bus lost 2 cylinders. He has now put a 1648 set
of Heads/pistons/barrels. Does the list have any experience of this? I know
that his fuel economy went down, but what other probs are there?
Overheating?
