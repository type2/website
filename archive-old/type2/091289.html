Subject: Re: [T2] loosing brake pressure!!HELP!!!

&gt;&gt;&gt;  the pedal went slowly to the floor
&gt; &gt; inch by inch. the fluid
&gt; &gt; level  hasn't changed
&gt; &gt;  74 with a 2.0l and a single Webber
&gt;
&gt;Sounds like the brake booster is going bad or you have
&gt;lost your vaccume to it. Phil&lt;&lt;

just as a rule of thumb. if the brake pedal is HARD, then your
booster is going bad. if the pedal is SOFT, its usually the 
master cylinder.

also, someone mentioned rebuilding a master cylinder. PLEASE
do not attempt this if you are not trained in how to do so. if
you do rebuild it yourself,
please always stay in front of me on the road. ;-)

just spend the $ &amp; get one from a parts house. if it fails in an
accident then you have the receipt from the parts place &amp; they
can be held liable, not you.

jeez, i think i sound like an old fart more &amp; more everyday...
