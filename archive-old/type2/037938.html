Subject: Kadrons on a 72-79 Bus.

I wast looking over my 74 bus motor last night and did some thinking. I have a set of Kadrons for my Bug that I won't need for a few months and started playing around with the idea of putting them on the 74 Bus. I asked if there are any Manifolds made for this and there are not. The carbs are cheaper than dual Webers and even cost less than having your 32/34 PDSIT's redone. So to make them work I would need to make some manifolds. This I can do. I would also have to modify the Bug linkage, I can do that also. I know that the Kadrons have no choke and that would be a little problem for the colder climates. If I could get this set-up working on my Bus, would there be any intrest in having some manifolds Cast? I will have to check and see if Iron or Aluminum would be cheaper and what the cost would be. 
  Please give any feed back you have, I like the Kadrons and think they would be a good replacement for the stock carbs for a stock motor. I know that they will not work on a perfomance type 4, but if you have you will not be looking to save money anyway. I have put a lot of thought into this and could use some insight into areas I have not explored.Thanks
