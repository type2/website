Taken aback a bit. I LOOVVEE MY BUS, I like my J_at__at_P. An Odd moment happend
over the fall that is worthy of mention ( dont you love how posts mutate?
What was this orig. about?) My Fiance took the J_at__at_P on a Hour or so trip and
when she came back there was steam/smoke pouring out from under the hood. I
looked at it in the morning and it was the heater hose. Coolant ALL OVER THE
ENGINE!!.
    I hopped in Blue and drove to Pep Boys to by a new heater hose and
coolant. On driving back and loving driving Blue I looked down at the parts
and stuff for the J_at__at_P and felt bad that I was doing something for the J_at__at_p
and not for Blue. I filled him up with 93 as a treat and laughed with him
(no im not insane, I swear he was laughing!!) at the idea of having a heater
hose and coolant in my air cooled vehicle bringing it to fix my air impaired
vehicle. Every now and then one side helps out the other and since then the
two have bonded and know each others roles.
Take care all!
Steve and Blue
