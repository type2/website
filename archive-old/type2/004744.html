&gt;  What does it mean when your oil
&gt;has a gas smell?

&gt;&gt;  lots of answers possible there, would probably need more information.
&gt;&gt;  how is starting?
&gt;&gt;  how is idle?
&gt;&gt;  gas mileage?
.
&gt;Now about these questions I can't answer them because i havn't gotten to the
&gt;point where i can start it up yet. (Soon I hope)

Best to cnange the oil before you start this engine, remove and clean the screen..
Do all the maintenance procedures you can find, valve adj, points, static timing, etc.
Then proceed with diagnostics from the Bentley, the Muir was not written for the type 4.
