Subject: Re: Plugs &amp; Compression testing

I would think that the danger of damaging threads is greatest when
*installing* the spark plugs. So...logic says if you're worried, perhaps
after a compression test you should allow the engine to cool before
installing the spark plugs.

Just my opinion; nothing scientific going on in this head. ;) Joe

&gt;Here's a question that's been bugging me for quite some time.  I almost
&gt;feel silly asking it, but I figure that questions are the root of all
&gt;knowledge...  :-)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;1) When changing plugs, I've alway been told it is best to do it on a
&gt;   COLD ENGINE to reduce the risk of stripping the head.  Okay, simple enough
&gt;   to swap plugs on a cold engine...
&gt;
&gt;2) When checking cylinder compression, I'm always been told to do it on a WARM
&gt;   ENGINE.  This is obviously correct, since only when the engine is warm will
&gt;   tolerances be correct, etc, etc.
&gt;
&gt;So you see the source of my confusion.  The two rules are mutually exclusive.
&gt;
&gt;Does this mean then that it is *preferable* to pull plugs from a cold
&gt;engine, but that I shouldn't particularly worry when removing them from a
&gt;warm one?  Does it mean that the temperature of the motor is in no way
&gt;associated with likelihood of plug stripping?  Have I just been feed a load
&gt;of hooey about when it's best to pull the plugs?
&gt;
&gt;And, *yes*, I do use anti-sieze religiously on the spark plug threads...
