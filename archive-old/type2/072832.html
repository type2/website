&gt;&gt;Tanks get all sorts of sludge in them. One
time Joe Fournier had a tank that kept giving him trouble and when he
finally sloshed it all sorts of stuff came out, organic and otherwise,
including a dessicated mouse (yes!). I think that tank took two sloshings
to get right.&lt;&lt;

Is this 'conventional wisdom' or am I just taking things out of context?

Almost Friday!
