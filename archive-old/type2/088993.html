Subject:  [T2] I'm sorry




 Well G-D Chris.  I really wasn't whining or being pissy, but maybe I should
 just forward my emails to you to handle.  I chose this forum to advertise
 first, because I thought we were all adults and were fond of these
vehicles.
 And I wasn't rude in the least to some jerk who essentially said, give me
 your Busses for free because I don't have one!  .

 The print ads are next.  They will be complete and will hopefully not
 attract undesirables.  All I ever hear is why are the good Busses in
 California?  I would think that a decent Bus somewhere else in the country
 would bring some interest.  If no one wants them, fine.  But don't ask
 questions like will you take X-amount, when you've never seen it.  Don't
 tell me you only want one part (for free most of the time) and leave me
with
 the rest.  And don't then condemn me when I've had enough and then say so.
 I was sorry that the whole thing went on and got out of hand so the
 interpreters had to speak up.

 And finally if I didn't give a damn then I wouldn't have posted anything in
 the first place.  I am now sorry I brought it up at all and offer humble
 apologies to the list.  Chris can go pound sand.
