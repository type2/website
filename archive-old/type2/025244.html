Subject: RE: New Mexican Longblock, final prep bits -- distributor

I wanted to re-visit this again, as I'm still a bit confused.  Situation is
a new Mexican Longblock, but I believe any longblock has the same basic
issue.  Comes without distributor drive gear, and I'm opting to purchase new
parts instead of pulling from a used engine.

Gene Berg Enterprises catalog 1995/1996 edition, page 150.

 VWB040-105-209.1  Steel crankshaft gear to drive camshaft
 VWB040-105-223.1  Brass crank gear to drive the distributor
 VWB040-105-231.1  Dist drive pinion from brass gear to distributor
 VWB040-105-233   Dist drive pinion spring between drive pinion and
distributor
 VWB111-105-235A  Dist drive pinion gear end play thrust washer/spacer.

Ok, so I'm trying to figure out what I need to start from a scratch
longblock and go all new.  Tom Wilson book tells me I need at least two
washers, so I know that much.  Would this complete my longblock:

   3 washers (VWB111-105-235A)
   1 drive pinion (VWB040-105-231.1)
   1 spring ((VWB040-105-233)

And that would complete my distributor gear system, ready to drop the
distributor in?  Or do I need to be ordering any other components?
