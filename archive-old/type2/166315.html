&gt; Hey Dan,
&gt; 
&gt; That is an awesome offer. What does it take to move the site?

That can be difficult.  They either ship me a server, or they migrate 
all the services to my hardware.  Either way it's not a process that 
happens without effort.  My free hosting is also contingent on my 
continued employment, but if I get fired the plug is pulled.  That is 
also a consideration.  I've been in touch with one of the admins, and 
they know what I can and cannot provide.  In the meanwhile everyone 
should continue to donate.  I gave $20 a week or two ago.  I know many 
others can afford $20.  Or even $2.
