&gt;Thanks for the tip - it doesn't blow fuses?
&gt;Where did you mount the blower? I have read that it is
&gt;loud if mounted close to or under the driving
&gt;compartment. Is yours loud? I never have figured out
&gt;what turns that back bloe=wer on and off - the heater
&gt;lever?

1.  I am running both blowers off of the factory in-line fuse holder near 
the factory blower in the engine compartment.  I have (yes) never blown one 
of the red 20-amp fuses.

2.  The new bilge blower I mounted in-line, about five feet forward of the 
transmission.

3.  Yes, it is audible but not objectionably so.  Besides, it was almost 
seventy degrees in East Texas today.

4.  On my '72 the heater lever on the dash has an electrical switch.  When 
the lever is all the way down, the switch closes and grounds the wire from 
the relay in the engine compartment to turn on the fan(s).
