&gt;Well, David, they sure look like crap to me.

I called MSHP this afternoon and informed them of my situation.  The first
guy I talked to gave me the typical song and dance about the cracks being
no problem, and ditto the guide boss.  I then mentioned that I had some
pictures of the guide boss on the web and asked if they had a browser
there.  I got transfered to someone else (my guess, I was upgraded) who
took the URL and my phone number and offered to call me back.

15 minutes later I got a callback from Norm (I think that was his name -
wrote it down but don't have it with me).  He and I talked for a while and
he convinced me that the cracks were no big deal.  Said the seats
definately would NOT come loose because of the cracks and that's why they
have a 5 year 100k warranty on dropped seats.  I guess I have to trust them
on that.

He did agree that I shouldn't have gotten a head with a broken guide boss
and volunteered to ship me out another set if I would ship that set back to
him.  I didn't really want to have to do that, but I guess I will take them
up on it since I really don't like that guide boss as is, and they didn't
think that grinding down the other bosses to match was a good idea.  He
made a point of saying that he wanted to work with his customers and that I
should always call if I had concerns.

I hate to say this but I think they may have been influenced by the web
page.  I did not intend this even though I wrote the text without regard to
MSHP's feelings.  It is a free country after all, and I don't think I was
that hard on them.  I did not trash them, I simply stated what I found.
What's more, I'm going to update the page with their comments and offer to
ship me replacement heads.  I want to be totally fair about this, and
hopefully I will be able to add more glowing comments later about the great
service and fantastic new heads that I received from them.

&gt;Makes me wonder what I'd
&gt;find if I pulled the heads off my GEX engine.

Don't do it.  I didn't like my GEX heads even when I picked out the best
set they had.  I can't believe I'm saying this, but my GEX heads do have
56,000 miles on them now with the only tangible problem being the stripped
air injector holes.  I'm thinking I am lucky and I really can't wait to get
them off my engine and into boxes where they will stay until I need them as
emergency spares.

&gt;This also looks like a real good argument for doing your own heads.

Yeah, if you can weld aluminum, install seats and grind valves.  :)

&gt;It looks like they busted that chunk out of the valve guide boss while
&gt;driving a new guide in.  I think it's incredible that they'd foist that
&gt;off on anyone.  That guide is going to overheat and considerably shorten
&gt;the life of the valve.

I agree.  I hope they dispose of it when they get it back, or at least weld
it up.

&gt;So much for the highly touted Mark Stephens.

I'm not writing them off just yet.  As another poster suggested, sometimes
things fall through the cracks.  I'm hoping this was one of those times.
I'm going to try my best to cooperate with them, because I really do think
they can produce a quality product (unlike GEX) and I want a quality
product.
