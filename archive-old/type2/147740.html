Subject: Route Querie: Port Huron MI - Mt Vernon OH.

Hi Volks,

Next week post-BOTC I'll be recuperating at &quot;The Pinery&quot;, one of the  
finest public parks Ontario has to offer. On Thursday we leave our  
campsite on the shores of Lake Huron and head down to Rustic Knolls  
Campground in Mt Vernon Ohio in time for the Dixie Bus Gathering

http://www.geocities_dot_com/dixie_bus_gathering/.

My current plan is to cross the border at Port Huron and travel I-75  
south through Detroit and Toledo, then South and east on Rt 15, 23  
and 95.

Google says I'd be better off to take I-80 east to Cleveland, then  
head south on I-271, but that adds another hour to the trip, and  
besides, the westfakia much prefers state highways to interstates.


Suggestions on what to see or avoid in OH between Toledo and Mt  
Vernon would be greatly appreciated.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
