John,

I am gonna take a shot at describing my experience with making a dip stick
temp gauge. I think it works great and cost me about $25. I believe there is
a post in the library by Mike Benthin, which is where I got the idea. Mike
was glad to help me along.
You need:
1. A digital meat thermometer. There are several types at Wal-Mart. The one
I used cost $20. It is different than most in that the digital readout
screen is remote from the metal probe. The probe (imagine a stainless steel
ball-point pen refill) has the sensor in its tip. two wires run from this
sensor and out the top of the probe. The probe is crimped where the wires
exit. The wires continue for about four feet and are molded into a plug
which looks sorta like a plug for headsets. The plug can be plugged into the
digital read out box, which is about the size of a wallet. Now, the probe is
not straight. It curves at its top, forming a handle for pushing/pulling the
probe into/out of meats.  This needs to be straightened out, which I did for
the most part by hand. I used the little side table on my Westy as a soft
vice to finish the job. Now, this straightening process may form some crimps
which will be of no consequence.
2. You need a piece of brass tubing, the OD of which will fit down you
dip-stick tube. It has to have a ID that will accommodate the
now-straightened probe. I found such a tube at only one place, a hobby shop,
and they had plenty of them in different sizes. Bring the probe and your
dipstick with you when you go to buy the tube. This will ensure that you buy
a tube of the correct length and diameter. The crimps might make the probe
slightly wider at points. Gently file these down if necessary.
3. You need some 2 part, slow-setting epoxy.
4. You need some wire which will be spliced into the 4 foot wire provided
with the thermometer. I used doorbell wire.
5, You need a washer that will go around the brass tube and act as a dip
stick stop.
6. You need a small piece of rubber hose that will go around the top of the
brass tube and act as a handle as well as keep the wires that will run up
the tube from the now-set-in-epoxy probe from crimping.
I will describe the rest as briefly as I can. Cut the provided wire near the
plug. Run the wires up through the tube. Epoxy probe into tube, making sure
it is set to extend approximately 3&quot; beyond bottom of tube. Fill tube
w/epoxy as best you can. Epoxy washer at correct height to allow tip of
probe to stop its downward travel just sort of the bottom of the sump. Run
wires through piece of rubber hose then push hose onto tube. Splice about 12
feet of wire to wires coming out of probe. Run wires to front of bus then
splice wires to plug.  Plug into digital thing. Voila! Now you can monitor
you oil temp, you engine compartment temp, the ambient temp, and yes, even
your body temp!  Now, this is important. I said there were two wires, but
that is not exactly correct, although it did make it a little easier to
describe this process. Actually there is one wire inside a metal/mesh
sheath. The sheath itself acts as the second wire. The wire inside the
sheath gets spliced.  A wire must also be secured to both ends of the
sheath. I simply slid a piece of wire under each end of the cut sheath and
secured with epoxy. There are different types of thermometers and obviously
different ways of making this thing. I had no soldering gun,  so everything
got glued together. The design of the meat thermometer with its remote,
plug-in read screen out made it superior to those of uni-construction which
involve disassembly and soldering some rather short, delicate wires. One
other point: I keep my regular dipstick in the engine compartment to take
oil measurements as I could not get a good reading off the brass tube.
