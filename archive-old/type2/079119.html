Subject: Re: [T2] Alcohol and Driving


I looked at this for a while. I thought maybe if you distilled your own 
ethanol (grass clippings, leaves, soybean hulls, etc) it might be a 
cheap and environmentally benign fuel. In Brazil they make it from sugar 
cane cellulose left over from sugar production; this is a nearly ideal 
material for distilling (as the mariners all know =^).

Commercially available ethanol in the US is expensive; I was able to 
find it for ~$7.00/gallon in five gallon pails. Maybe if you bought it 
by the tanker you could get it for a lot less. There is no 
infrastructure here for selling it as a motor fuel so you'd have to 
carry your fuel with you, which rules out long trips.

Alcohol does not have nearly the calories of gasoline; it is necessary 
to run a far higher compression ratio to get sufficient horsepower to 
move a car acceptably. This rules out bi-fuel engines. With some 
alternative fuels, especially propane, it is possible to run both 
gasoline and another fuel, although it is not optimal. You can't do that 
with alcohol. The low energy content also means bulky tanks (or 
comically tiny cruise range).

It's also quite corrosive to rubber they say.
