Safety wire rules!! When I was in the aircraft industry, nearly evey bolt
has &quot;SWIRE&quot; on it, and Ib got super good at making it pass &quot;Q.A.&quot;
requirements......it is  hard to get those 7 twists per inch,
sometimes....Safety wire pliers, better known as &quot;SWIPES&quot; are the handiest
tool, you can have.

&gt; Try a motorcycle shop for safety wire. Most race tracks require alot of
the
&gt; bolts on a bike to be safety wired. They would also carry the cool wrench
&gt; that spins the wire.
