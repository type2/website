&gt;Dear volks-
&gt;	The other day I saw a 69 bus like mine with a RV a/c unit on the roof. 
&gt;I have been debating getting one for my 69.  Does anybody have any
&gt;comments on doing such a thing.  Can the roof handle the weight of the
&gt;unit.  Since this bus is not a camper there are no added supports on the
&gt;roof.  And since the roof has to be cut will this hurt the roofs
&gt;structure?  Will the a/c keep the roof solid? How dificult is it to do? 
&gt;Can it be done?  I called a local RV place here in New Mexico and they
&gt;sell everything I need for $650.  

Since you saw another bus like yours with it installed, I'd say it could be
done.  I don't think it will compromise the structure of the vehicle
significantly.  Of course, any weight up that high is a bad thing, but it's
probably not enough to make a huge difference.

&gt;That seems reasonable since a ICE unit
&gt;costs over $1000 and it is run by the engine (possible overheating). 
&gt;This is run by a the battery it will not strain my engine.

Uh, no, it is not run by the battery.  You will have to plug it in
somewhere, like a campground.  You will not be able to use it while driving
unless you get fancy with inverters and such.  Remember the principle of
conservation of energy - A/C requires power, and whether it is being
supplied by the engine or a battery or shore power really makes no
difference - the same amount of power will be required (roughly).  Any A/C
you have that works while you're driving will steal a couple of horsepower
&gt;from your engine.

Maybe I should explain further.  Having engine-driven A/C will slow down
your bus about the same amount as having electric A/C, because electric A/C
is driven by an inverter which is driven by the battery which is charged by
the alternator which is driven by the engine - so it all boils down to the
same load on the engine except in the case of electric A/C you will
probably have more conversion losses plus you will have to beef up your
alternator and your batteries and buy an expensive, high-power true sine
wave inverter.  That's a lot of trouble and expense added to the $650.

110V roof-mounted A/C units are for the big behemoth RVs that spend 90% of
their time parked on a strip of dirt between the interstate and the
railroad tracks that someone posted a &quot;campground&quot; sign in front of.
Unless you spend the majority of your camping time in such places, I
wouldn't recommend the rooftop A/C unit.

As for &quot;possible overheating&quot;, I am getting tired of hearing that term
thrown around and I have posted before on the subject.  A/C will take a few
extra horsepower from your engine when it is on (1.5 from the Sankyo rotary
compressor).  If your engine produces 40 horsepower to drive the rear
wheels with the pedal to the floor, then it probably will only produce 38
horsepower with the A/C on.  Most of the time you won't have your foot to
the floor though - you will have it partway down and be using maybe 20-30
horsepower to keep your bus moving at 55 or 60 mph.  So, with the A/C on
you will have your foot just a teeny bit farther down that you would without.

Now then - lots of things cause you to put your right foot down a teeny bit
farther.  A slight headwind, an incline, a discharged battery, a dirty air
filter, too much oil in the engine, larger-than-stock tires, etc. but
nobody ever talks about these things killing your engine.  Maybe it's
because the solution is obvious - slow down a little (or fix the problem).
A/C is not some kind of black voodoo that will cause your motor to
spontaneously combust on the freeway - it's simply an additional small load
on the engine.  Don't be afraid of it.  Use common sense and your motor
will not overheat.  You may have to slow down 2mph - I decided I would
gladly pay that price for a 30+ degree drop in air temperature, and what's
wonderful is that if you need that 2mph back you can switch the A/C off and
*presto* you have it back.
