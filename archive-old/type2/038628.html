Subject: can canvas be put on with poptop off?

In the Bently Manual, the diagrams show first half of poptop canvas 
installation being done with poptop off the vehicle.  My poptop is currently 
off, I have a new tent from Bus Depot ready to install on my 71.  I'm on 
vacation this week, and really would like to complete this, but don't want to 
make it any harder than I have to.  Has anyone installed the canvas with 
poptop off, and are there any disadvantages to doing it this way?  It seems 
to me it would save some &quot;working with arms raised over your head&quot; work, but 
I don't know.  Any replies and other advice appreciated, cuz I'm ready to go 
on this.
