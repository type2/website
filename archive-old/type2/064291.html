Subject: FS '90 Passat Wagon (in WV)

OK forgive me not van related but for anyone wanting a modern VW
people hauler that can get near 30 mpg worth your look.

Mom is selling her '90 Passat Wagon to buy either a Legacy Outback
or the '97 Passat Wagon our dealer just got,  I am admittedly voting
for the Outback while longing for her to get the Passat secretly.

Anyway the stats.
4 spd automatic
2.0 16V of course
65k miles or so
power windows, locks, heated mirrors all your normal goodies
tilt/slide power sunroof
steel wheels though
standard 6 speaker stereo
light metallic grey/silver
all maintainence done routine by the book by me or dad
both fuel pumps replaced soon out of warranty
various warranty repairs, all receipts
new Techtonics performance exhaust, cat back
fairly new brakes and tires all round.
all belts especially the all important timing belt at 55k or so.

A not smoked in, one older female driver, one owner car.
Clean inside and out, always cared for.

She has parking curbed the front resulting in my removing the
spoiler because the lower bumper cover is damaged.  $250 will
get you the cover and spoiler new, less used, looks OK as it is
though.  LeBra included but no longer works without spoiler,
would cover a non-painted bumper cover fully for ultra cheap
repair though.

She simply wants more than the pitiful amount Subaru dealers
are offering (a real sellers market on those darn Outbacks,
O long lost Quantum Syncro you were before your time)  asking
is $6750, less than NADA retail for this car, less than NADA
trade value in fact I believe.  It is a good, fast, competant
handling, hauler of 2 or 3 kids with good solid German build quality
who needs a better home.  Any offers seriously considerd but make em
quick if interested.  She will likely buy new next weekend.

Located in Clarksburg WV
I'd estimate 3.5 hours from DC or Baltimore, 2.5 from Pittsburg.
