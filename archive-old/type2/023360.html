Subject: RE: [T2] #3 cyl not pulling its weight

I have watched all the dizzy talk and have noticed that nobody has mentioned
tightening the intake manifold. You didn't mention (or did you) if it was a
single port or duel port engine. I have found on numerous occasions that a
cylinder does not fire at idle and just tightening the intake manifold has
cured the problem, due to the small air leak.
this may not be your problem but is definate something I would look into.

Subject: [T2] #3 cyl not pulling its weight


I discovered a disturbing fact the other day.  My #3 cyllinder is not
contributing to the engine's power.  When I pulled the spark plug wire off,
the rpms did not change, whereas doing this for the other cyllinders slows
it down and makes it rough.  Engine does not run rough when the other three
are firing, although there is a little backfiring on decel.

I ran the engine with the #3 plug out, and it appeared to be sparking ok.
plug was not fouled.  I smelled gas in the air coming out the spark plug
hole.  Any guesses as to what the matter is?

Thanks,

Grant
