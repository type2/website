&gt; Hi, 
&gt;  new to the list so I'll say hello.
&gt; Names Andrew, from London &amp; I have a '76 lhd high-top
&gt; 1600 camper. I need to replace the fuel sender &amp; I would rather not
&gt; take the tank out etc... The inside of the rear floor is covered with ply
&gt; wood, so any hole would be covered. Does any-one have accurate
&gt; measurements for the hatch. I presume it is to be cut in the rear cargo
&gt; area, just before the 45 degree slope to the wheel arches. The van is just
&gt; going into a friends shop to have loads of welding done, so an ideal time
&gt; to do it. Any info is appreciated, i have checked the archives, but there
&gt; are only vague references &amp; purism arguments. 

It may be possible to replace the sender in your bus without removing 
the tank OR cutting it up.  According to the Rocky Mountain Motor 
Works catalog, they switched from the tubular sender that's in mine 
to a hinged, ball-on-a-rod type in '73.  It is my understanding that 
this type can be extracted with the engine and tank in place, 
requiring only the removal of the sheet metal screws holding the 
firewall panel in place.  I haven't actually done this, but it would 
seem to be the easiest of the three methods if it works.  This is for 
US vehicles so I don't know if other countries switched to the 
different sender at the same time, of course.
