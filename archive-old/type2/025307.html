Dear all, I need help for my '68 Transporter.  Everything electrical works,
or did before I started adding stuff. The stuff is: a dashmounted Hella
defrost fan,  a heater assist fan mounted behind the belly pan in-line,
power socket, VDO tach and oil pressure and temperature guages and finally
bright new Bosch headlights.  The headlights need a relay, which I neglected
to ask about at the time of installation.  Things got very HOT near my
fusebox, but I avoided burning by turning off the lights and am now driving
during daylight only :).  Also, I have a carefully installed stereo, the
clipping out of which alerted me to the under dash heat problem. The PO had
also modified to add an electric windshield washer fluid pump which I've
removed.  My questions are probably better directed to someone via pmail as
I think it's very specific to my bus.

 Is there anyone on the list who is willing to mentor me through an
under-dash tutorial via email, telephone or, if you are in the Seattle area,
in your yard.  
I will gratefully welcome all advice even the anticipated, &quot;you've just got
to hang by your knees from the driver's seat, label and disconnect
everything CAREFULLY, reconnect the OE to its correct fuse and run all of
the new stuff to a new fuse block with a new hot lead from the battery while
your head rests oh so comfortably on the clutch pedal&quot;.
I am willing ! and I'd really appreciate moral and practical support.
Thanks,
Jody and 
Stella (68 Bus with a brand new heart of gold)
Seattle WA
