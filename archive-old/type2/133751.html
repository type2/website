Subject: Re: [T2] Roll Back Odometer , replacing engine....

Hi Folks,

What about adding an hour meter to the new engine?  That way you'll be able 
to track hours vs. miles, and will be able to have a Zero starting point for 
the engine.

If that doesn't work, just keep a good log of maintenance and record the 
actual mileage.  I think there's some legal implication to altering your 
vehicle's odometer -- check your title and see if there's anything there 
regarding accurate original mileage.

However, if you want to legally remove mileage from your odometer, just 
drive your Bus backwards for a few thousand miles.  It'll wear your Reverse 
gear, but that gear never gets as much use as the other 4, so it's nearly as 
good as it was when it was new!    :-)

Good Luck!
