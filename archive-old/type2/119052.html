Actually, one of my friends bought a property in South Florida. We found
an old 1978 Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz in the brush. It was rusted to
hell, so I took my angle grinder and cut the roof off. We later learned
that it has an 8-Track / CB Radio in it. The motor and transmission were
fine. I did general maintenance on it, and my friend now drives it around
almost every day. He's put about 10 thousand miles on it. He spent a
total of about $400 bucks on it. I bought a KISS and Hotel Califnornia
8-Track at the local $wap $hop and that's what we listen to when we
cruise in it.

You can see pictures of me chopping the roof off at:

I later learned that they only made exactly 200 Cadillac Biarritz Coupes
with the power sunroofs.  Ooops.. wish I had known this before I cut the
roof off, oh well.

&gt; ... I snagged a bunch of CDs from my parents many years ago when I was
still in high school and living inside...
 
CD's?  Had you written &quot;8-track cassettes&quot;, I would have been impressed.
:O)
