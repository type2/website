Subject: Door seals fix

Hi Group
Recently there was an excellent write up about replacing the front door 
seals, scrapers
and some related great how - to tips on a baywindow camper.
I downloaded it, printed it out and later hopelessly lost it.
Will the author please p-mail a copy to me or if anyone has is on file, 
kindly share it. The post has not made it to the archives yet.
Thank you immensely
Bucket
