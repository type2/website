Subject: Re: [T2] Who makes the best front rotors for '72 bus? And think
   I can do it myself?

I used a wooden broomhandle.  Doesn't hurt anything, and you probably
have it lying around.  I'm sure someone will flame if this is a bad
practice.
Richard mentioned the backing plates.  You probably don't have them,
but you can get them from the online vendors.  Scott at German Import
(sorry, I can't remember the exact name) usually has them.  I got mine
from him.  Bad memory + new work computer = no old links handy.
 
&gt; I believe all of this info applies to 71-72 brakes as it does to
&gt; 73-79 brakes. Someone can correct me if not.
It all applied to my '72.  I can't remember who's rotors I used, got
them from a ACVWFLAPS (Discount Import Parts for you Puddletown
locals).

Martin suggested doing your front wheel bearings.  I think that's a
good idea too, as you'll be most of the way in there once the rotors
come off.  

Yes, you can do this in your driveway.  The most important part of that
is &quot;you can do this&quot;.
