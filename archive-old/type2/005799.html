...Last time I did it was with a friend who was a greasy mech, too.  Pulled
the
van up to the side of a building and touched the bumper to the bricks.  I
slipped the clutch in second while he took the readings under the load.  No
one was killed.
Not that I'm that greasy any longer...
Respectfully,
Steve


&gt;I'm in the process of trying to set my total advance and have a bit of a
&gt;logistics problem...
&gt;
&gt;How does one maintain 3000 rpms, hold the timing light, and rotate the
dizzy
&gt;with only two hands?
&gt;
&gt;What's the trick?  Do you get a partner, or can this be done easily with
&gt;only myself...?
