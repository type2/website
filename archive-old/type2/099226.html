Subject: Re: [T2] 009 not good for my bus?

Short and sweet:  The 009 advances only on engine speed. The correct (read: 
stock) distributor advances on both speed and load. (It also retards under 
heavy load. Critical to avoid detonation and holes in pistons.) If you only 
drive an unloaded bus in Kansas then the 009 is an okay choice.  If you're 
going to drive a loaded bus up a hill, the stock distributor would be a 
better choice.
