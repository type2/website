Subject: USC All-Metal Westfalia Dilemna 

Howdy,

Well I've gotten past the welding stage thanks to some help from some list 
members.
Now I'm putting a little all-metal putty here and there on my 71 Westy where 
needed.

My problem is this.
I think and guess I didnt use enough of the hardener when I mixed it in with 
the all-metal.

I went onto the uschem_dot_com site and found what the hardener looked like and 
it is exactly what I have.

Here is the short story.
Last week I put some on, and although the can said it would be dry and be 
sandable in 3-4 hours it was still tacky.
Then I stepped in a small hole in the ground and sprained my ankle.
That and the rain we had here in Jersey meant I didnt touch the bus for 
another week.
Well the all-metal was perfect by then and I sanded it down and some parts 
look great.

But some parts I needed to touch up and some parts I missed so I put on a 
little more here and there on last Saturday.
Well last night (Monday) it was still tacky.

I've gone thru about a 1/4 of the can and also about 1/4 of the hardener so 
I dont know how I'm not using enough but obviously that is the case.
On the back of the can it says to use 15 drops for a golf ball size amount 
of all-metal and I'm guessing I used about 7-9 drops.
It just seems like I'm going thru the hardener real quick and if I use the 
amount on the can I am going to be out of it real quick.
I called the auto body store and asked if I could just buy the hardener (in 
case I ran out) and was told he had to sell me the all-metal also as they 
only have enough hardener for the amount of all-metal cans they have.
So as you can see I dont want to run out of the hardener and have half a can 
of all-metal still left.

So my question is basically this.

Should I bite the bullet and if its still tacky tonight try to get it off 
and try again this time with plenty of hardener?
Or is leaving it on and letting it get hard over the span of a week going to 
be ok?
I dont mind waiting as long as when it finally dries it will be ok, but am 
curious what other list members might have done in a similiar situation.

As mentioned before I'm not sure how long it took the first all-metal to dry 
that I put on as I didnt touch the bus for a week.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks
Kevin
