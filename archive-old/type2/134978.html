Subject: RE: [T2] 185R14 tires really 185/85?

&gt; So someone just mentioned in another forum 
&gt;  that 185r14s werenot 185/100s 
&gt; but more like 185/85 or 185/82?


185R14 is a European size designation that actually translates to 185/82R14
(The 82 is &quot;assumed.&quot; Why? I have no idea.)  The closest size that uses a
middle digit would be 185/80R14, which is not a common size (although
Vredestein make it).  That size is within 1/8&quot; of a 185R14 - close enough
that my Vredestein distributor actually inventories it as a 185R14.
