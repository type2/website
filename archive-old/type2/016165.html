Before installing the duct tape I stopped several times to see if the flaps
were open and they never were.  Even after installing the tape the flaps
never opened completely.  I know they operate correctly because they work
fine in warmer weather, but there are times when they just need a little
help from good ole duct tape.

&gt;That's what the thermostat and flaps are for, not duct tape.
