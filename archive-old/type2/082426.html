&gt; 78 came with the mesh cover or not. Whenever vw started=20
&gt; putting smog pumps on they left off the cover. Try the=20
&gt; boneyard, Busted Bus or the Bus Boys.

I wasn't even aware that there was a mesh cover until I
saw some engine pics from other listees.  So I assume it's OK to
omit this cover?  I'm not inclined to stick my fingers in there
when the engine is running, but is there a likelyhood that debris
could get sucked in there?
