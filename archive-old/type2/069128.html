Got some more data by doing dinner at a place a half-hour away.  If I
tread lightly on the throttle, it runs pretty well, but doesn't really want
to accelerate.  If I give it lots of throttle, it wuffles out, kind of
like it's flooding.  Letting up partway will get it to recover and
then increase RPMs.  Since the only thing that's changed is the
distributor, I'm pretty sure this is a timing thing.  The question is,
which way to adjust (preferably, which way should I rotate the
distributor)?

Thanks much.
