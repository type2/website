&gt; I would not use these!  The RD-603, yes; the 603V, no.  &quot;Highway rib&quot;
&gt; tread designs are mostly used on trailers and are designed for straight
&gt; tracking.  They are not designed for braking, turning, or traction.  This
&gt; may not be true of this tire, but I would still not use them.

Actually, the RD-603 and the 603v is the same tire. And they're
surprisingly good.  I know they look like a highway rib design, and are
classed as such...but they perform nicely on pavement.  And I'm sure you
know how I drive, steve. :)

(of course, if you need an M+S rating where you live, the 603v is NOT

(the yoko 356 DOES, from what I've heard from the drivers of said tires,
qualify for &quot;...not designed for braking, turning, or traction...&quot; though.
