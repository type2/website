Subject: Electric Gremlins/ Rewiring 

I am interested in purchasing a '69 van, with 16k original, but there is
a catch.. it is described below:

(Begin Quote) &quot;The van has 16,000 miles on the body.  The engine is a
rebuilt porsche engine with around 100 miles on it.  The reason for the
low miles is because it has been sitting due to an electrical problem.

 The engine runs very well.  It has an electrical problem that could be
solved by rewiring the van.  This sounds horrific, but with a little
time it would be rather simple.  The problem is that it does not charge,
and it blows regulators, and it does have a good generator.

 I just installed a reconditioned carb, spark plug wires, rotor,
condenser, and points.  The battery is also bran new.  It has an idling
problem&quot;  (End Quote)

Can such matters be sucessfully dealt with or is this a perpetual headache
in the making? Past threads (archives) deal with specific problems but how
about the general sort?  

Thanks Much,    Chris Binder    Milwaukee, WI    '71 KG FS
