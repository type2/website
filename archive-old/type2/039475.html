Content-Disposition: inline

I'm happy to report that I received an inspection sticker on my 72 bus. It took
me about 40 days, which
is appropriately biblical. After a stupid brakeless drive (at 5am to prevent
hitting any jaywalkers) to a place
called 'White Rabbit' auto repair. I dropped the bus off and let him know I was
a Jefferson Airplane fan, which
it turns out made a difference. He bled my brakes, I got good comeback on the
pedal, gave me the sticker
and I was out the door on Sunday. My work is far from over however. Now I can at
least not worry about parking
tickets and concentrate on getting this van right for the summer. Next task: A
compression test. Next purchase
I can't afford, at least one new heater box. Next crazy idea: reinstall the AC
compressor and hook up the Air Conditioning.
Anyone know the belt size for the AC?

Thanks for everyones help. Pictures of the rescue are available. More will be
mounted on the Motor Hole's upcoming web page - if I ever get a rainy day.
