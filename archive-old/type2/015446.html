Sounds like NAPA. They know not the VW market. Thank the lawyers and the
imprudent mechanics they sued for rebuilding marginal cylinders that failed
and killed someone. Alas, very few rebuild kits for brake components are
available due to the majority of shops not willing to buy the legal risks
of suits. This liberty of economy in rebuilding components is a fading
dream in a society that always looks to shifting responsabilities from
those irresponsible to those with pockets to pick.

Frankly, $125 for a German MC is a bargain. It will last 20 years at least
if the fluid is renewed and the shoes are adjusted periodically during
normal reasonable maintenance inspections.
