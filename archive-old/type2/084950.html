Subject: Re: [T2] Gas Cap

I have to spray a bit of silicone spray on my gas cap to get it off and on 
from time to time.

Not good if you have an O2 sensor as I think silicone will poison it.

On my gas cap it is friction between the gasket&amp;cap and gasket&amp;filler neck.

Silicone makes it slide around easily and all is well.

&gt; &gt; Hey Chris,
&gt; &gt; I had to put 2 gaskets on my gas cap to make sure it sealed. My filler neck
&gt; &gt; had worn so much I couldn't get a tight seal. I posted about 2 years ago
&gt; &gt; when this happened that I actually spun the DC out on a slow left hand turn
&gt; &gt; where the gas spilled out onto my right rear tire causing a severe loss of
&gt; &gt; traction. The only fix for me was 2 gaskets on the stock cap.
&gt;
&gt;we need a compromise I can hardly get my gas cap on and off sometimes when
&gt;the gas jockey put it on tight it is next to impossible to get off.....
