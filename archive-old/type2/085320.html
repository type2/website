Subject: RE: [T2] Re: re: por-15 on pop tops

The directions I got say that it has to be top coated if it is exposed to
sunlight. The never state exactly what will happen, but they say that the UV
will harm it. Another problem might be that the rust is still active because
it is getting moisture from behind? POR 15 needs to be applied to both sides
of the metal, if it is a small hole, or it will not be very effective.
Surface rust should not matter, one side will work. Try their chassis coat
black over the POR 15 for UV protection or their primer and your own
topcoat. I have things around the house that have been painted with just POR
15 for almost 1 year and it has not changed color yet or rusted through.

Is POR15 less effective if it is not topcoated? I used it last year on some
carefully prepped rust spots and it is just coming right through. These
spots are exposed to the sun. It isn't clear in the directions about whether
it is damaged by UV or not, just that it changes color (it does). What has
been your experience on this?

&gt; i'd say go for it, that is the best darn stuff in the
&gt; world.  it does need to be topcoated though and would
&gt; use their top coating that way you wouldn't need to
&gt; use the tie coat between the two and it would be that
&gt; much tougher.  if you don't top coat it it turns
&gt; colors on you.  my silver under the bug turned slight
&gt; brown in some locations and would only be worse if
&gt; left in the direct sunlight.
