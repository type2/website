Subject: [T2] EveryBus 2001 - coming soon (new ideas and events)

and feed the masses. 

EveryBus 2001 Chilli contest and pot luch dinner.
There will be two catagories for the contest: meat and veggie. If you want to compete make a pot of one or the other. Everybody else bring a side dish. We will all gather under the shelter and eat together. I will draft a panel of distinguished judges and a prize will be awarded in each catagory. 

We will also do the door prizes after dinner. Last year we had quite a pile. In order to move things along this year I am considering doing the kids prizes at lunch on Saturday and perhaps having some ice cream for the kids if the weather is a little nicer than last year. If anyone has any ideas or wants to volunteer to run some kids events please let me know. EB is deffinately a family gathering and I want it to be specail for the kids :)

If you have questions or ideas please email me at ncbus_at_mindspring_dot_com
