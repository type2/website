Subject: no heater boxes? safe?

Hola..

So, im ready to tackle the BA6 install project, which will hopefully
both give me heat and eliminate any exhausty smells from coming into the
cabin. My wife is rather sensitive about those smells, so I was planning
in just removing the old heater system, since it wont even channel into
the bus anymore. 

But, does it serve another use? Can I get rid of that fan in the engine
compartment, and those two hoses, or is that not a good idea? 

And what about the heater boxes, will I need them anymore, for
non-heating use? 

Thanks for any input. 

Best,
Christopher
