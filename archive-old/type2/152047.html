&gt; 			I've been lurking here for a while and have been doing a load of research
&gt; on the web.     Our friend has just bought herself a 1977 type two camper
&gt; with a poptop.     I went to see it and it seems solid and mechanically
&gt; sound .. but brush painted so cheap ...
&gt;
&gt; 			She collects it tonight and wants to drive it to the South of France next
&gt; Monday.    I thought that an oil, plugs, dissy parts and grease nipples
&gt; would be a good starting point ..
&gt;
congratulations,


&gt; 			The previous owner is giving her all the manuals (including workshop) so
&gt; I don't have them as a reference at the moment ...  However I want to order
&gt; the parts for the job today ..
&gt;
&gt; 			Can I check .. There is no oil filter?   It's just the strainer that I
&gt; have to clean (with petrol?) and then replace the gaskets ?

so it has a 1600 engine and not the 2000 liter engine???  I  know the 1600
was stock in Europe but I thought the 2000 was an option,  I would check
the 2000 does have a oil filter.

&gt; 			There is a foam seal around the &quot;Engine pan&quot; between it and the body
&gt; about 50% of this is missing ... Is this an instant replace or can we leave
&gt; it a month ?

fix it,  it is summer in the South of France and the engine could overheat

&gt;
&gt; 			With 2CV flat twin engines the lifespan was massively improved with a
&gt; very expensive synthectic oil changed regularly.. is this 1600cc going to be
&gt; the same or can I use regular oil and 3000 mile intervals ?

I use synthetic in mine and have for many years, in a 1600 with no filter
I would continue to change at 3000 miles, in my 78 with a oil filter I
change before 5000 but usually after 4000

I would still change fuel lines even if they &quot;say&quot; they are new, also buy
a fire extingueser anyway.

enjoy
Bob
