Peregrine, the 1976 owner-camperized transporter with an (intentionally)
half-assed engine rebuild ran San Diego, CA to Tucson, AZ, and most of the
way back. She now awaits a ride on back of a flatbed in the mountains 70
miles east of San Diego with a toasted dipstick bellows and a thick
coating of oil throughout the engine compartment. 

Some quick stats and facts:

o  Average 22 miles per gallon! 

o  Broken intake valve stem (causing blowby)

o  Almost exactly the notorious 1000 mile rebuild

o  Owner red on the outside and blue on the inside

When she was good, she was very very good. And when she was bad she was 
horrid.

Long report to come.
