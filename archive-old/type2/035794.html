Subject: rough idle and low RPMs OK at RPM

Hello, seems that this problem is opposite of most the list entries in
the archives for this type of prob. My 79 FI bus (automatic, 2.0L) is
idling roughly at low RPMs and almost dying at idle. Not sure how many
miles are on the engine but it is three years old. I've re-adjusted my
valves, the spark plugs, the dist and tested the impedence of variouse
wires and plugs. I've replaced spark plug wiresm and done some other
common things. Any one have any idea what the common cause of this sort
of problem are? Everything seems peachy at higher RPMs but I do or come
close to dying at stops.

Thanks - CLW
