Subject: Re: [T2] more &quot;what is this?&quot; questions...

&gt; I also found a loose blue/green
&gt; wire, it is coming through the firewall on the bottom right hand side (if
&gt; your facing the front of the bus) with a bunch of other wires... it has a
&gt; female spade clip on it, and a male inserted into the female, but is
&gt; unattached to anything, I'll try and get a pic up on my site soon...

I believe that wire goes to the oil pressure sending unit. You mention later
that none of the dash lights work? If the oil light wire is not connected, it
will not light. Look down from the top and forward of your distributor for the
little sending unit. Probably you will not have a wire going to it, just a
short lead about 6&quot; long with nothing attached?

&gt; I'm going to replace that oil filler cap as soon as my next trip to the auto
&gt; parts store... when the bus is running I can feel spurts of air shooting out
&gt; of it... so I probably have low oil pressure...

No, having an open cap does not effect oil pressure.
What you are feeling blowing out is crankcase pressure. It is formed by the
pistons moving up and down and compression going past the rings. A little is
normal. Too much is bad rings and is called blow-by.



&gt; I think the bulbs for the
&gt; idiot lights are blown on the dash... anyone know where I can get these?
&gt;
&gt; Also...  I pretty much have no heater components... no fresh air fan, no tin
&gt; under the engine (I can see the push rod tubes from below...)  can I get
&gt; this stuff aftermarket?  any suggestions?  costly? I have the BN4, but
&gt; someone already pointed out that if I don't have this stuff, I have no
&gt; defroster... etc...

Used is about the only way to get these parts. I can help.....
You mentioned having a 79 with a 78 engine. Is the engine totally a 78? Or
does it have 79 exhaust on it? Makes a BIG difference on the lower tin.
Totally different pieces.



&gt; Thanks again for all the help, I love this stuff... especially when it
&gt; finally gets fixed... lol
