&lt;bigger&gt;Hello to all who brave Ole Man Winter.

As it happens a young man who lives here in Wisconsin, Peter Cunningham
has been many times Worlds Champion Ice Racer ( yes Cars ). Peter is a
terrific driver and great guy. He and I have co-taught specific drivers
schools, me doing the theory and classroom and Peter doing the driving
instruction.


OK, here is what I'll try to do ASAP. Get a hold of Peter and ask him for
the best approach and anything he thinks might be immediately useful.
I'll try and get this information posted soon as he can put complicated
ideas about vehicle dynamics in understandable terms.
