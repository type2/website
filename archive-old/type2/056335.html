Subject: RE: 67 camper?

&gt;I just in the middle of this. Please call JJ 913-xxx-2032

    The fellow is having an auction this Sunday at 11, please do NOT give
    out his phone number so he doesn't get bugged with a lot of calls like
    the one I just made... MAN it sounds like he has some PRIME items,
    though... I sure wish I was closer to where he is!!!

    He wants to sell everything as a unit, he said he doesn't have time to
    piece it out, he has the state on his back about his yard/shop.

    Please don't give out his phone number, there are hundreds more like
    me who'll call him up... I am almost drooling on my shirt from the things
    he described... I'm in California, and you just do not find items and
vehicles
    like what he was describing out here... if he could pick it up with a giant
    helicopter and set it down _at_ a west coast VW swap meet he'd make
    a fortune...
