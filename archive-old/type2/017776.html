&gt; Do you have a product called Blu Tak in the states? We use it to stick
&gt; posters etc

&gt; on walls? I stick some of it inside the spark plug spanner so that it
&gt; sticks to the plug.

It's never let me down yet. Maybe you could firmly attach some to the
end of a probe
and poke around trying to get the loose plug suck onto it - otherwise
just let it be and
put a new one in.  I can't see it affecting the cooling much. and when I
pulled my motor
out one time found one or two in there from a previous owner.
If you lose the socket with the plug in it, try wrapping some tape
around the joint between
the two before you start.
