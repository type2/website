Subject: Lexington KY machine shop

Does anyone out there have experience with a good general purpose VW machine
shop near Lexington KY? I found an ad for South Hill Auto Repair, but I
can't find the listed street (Deroode Street) in yahoo maps. If not, does
anyone want to sing the praises of an online machine shop?

Thanks,
Ron
