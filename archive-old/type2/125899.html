Subject: Re: [T2] towing capacity

Oh boy,, I am scared.

Me thinks your about 8 feet tooo long, and 1000 lbs tooo heavy

What is the tongue weight?  Less than 150lbs?
Brakes on that trailer?

&gt; Do you suppose a 1600 DP will tow this weight?
&gt;
&gt; Who out there is pulling campers?  I know you are there.  What does one of
&gt; those scamps weigh?  How about the pucks?
