&lt;&lt; I know this was posted last week but I just got back from camping (Pat the 
71 westy did great!).  I know most of us have had a leaky cover one time or 
another and the last time I adjusted the valves I couldn't get the darn 
things to stop.  Well, I called my trusted vw mechanic and he gave me a 
suggestion that seems to work like a charm.  (snip) &gt;&gt;

I've had a few gaskets slip over the years, so I learned this trick from 
another trusted mechanic.  Seal the gasket to the valve cover.  Clean the 
cover good and put down a good even layer of your favorite sealer.  I think I 
used the orange RTV stuff.  After the sealer gets tacky, press the gasket in 
place and install.

I've used this method for the past 15 years on several air cooled vws and it 
works great.  Your gasket will never slip.  It also helps your gasket last 
longer, and you can still adjust your valves as the gasket is only sealed on 
one side.
