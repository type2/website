Hi All....   I'm in the process of rebuilding a 34 PDSIT 2/3 carb...  I'm 
rebuilding the left carb on my 72 1700cc motor.

Here's the preface to the question.   On the very front of the left hand
carb... along the line that the Electromagnetic Cutoff valve is screwed
into... there are what looks to be two holes.  On my carb, one hole, on the
right &lt;FIF&gt; appears to be factory sealed, the other, on the left, looks like
it might have lost its seal.  Follow??  This means that I can actually see
the rod of the aforementioned valve. When I connect the valve to a battery
and then to the Electro cutoff valve... I can see the rod move!

Is this carb kacked?  Will it work if installed on the motor or will that
hole screw it up??

Barry


The Folly, 72 westy still under reconstruction.
