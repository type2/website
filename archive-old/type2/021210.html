KH, list:
I ALWAYS use an acetylene torch to heat them (and all other exhaust fasteners)
red hot to get them loose. A helper is really nice too. I hardly ever have any
break. As always, DON'T burn your CAR or GARAGE DOWN! Best is to work outside
when using the torch. And DON'T TOUCH THE HOT PARTS OR TOOLS. Stuff stays hot
enough to burn fingers at least 5 minutes!

 When you finally get them in...USE THE COPPER SELF

&gt; TIGHTENING EXHAUST STUD NUTS... that are available at you local VW Flaps.
&gt; They are a softer metal and will NEVER freeze on the steel studs.
&gt; Good Luck...
