Bob, the school guidance &amp; advice for getting a steering wheel off that has 
the tapered - TAPERED- steering shaft (not our '78 styled ones) is to (1) 
loosen the nut under the horn button, but do not take the nut of the 
steering shaft; (2) pull up on both sides of the steering wheel, using both 
hands (3) Have a helper smartly smack the steering shaft (with the nut still 
on) with a BMFH

This should get release the steering wheel and the nut being still on the 
steering shaft will prevent the steering wheel from flying way off the 
steering shaft with you still hanging on ! ! !

I have not been successful using this technique, and heat didn't help and 3 
months of Kroil didn't help..   'Tapping' the steering wheel un the 
underside with a rubber mallet didn't help.

I expect Jules tried to pull the steering wheel off by hand, and was 
unsuccessful, or why is he going for a steering wheel puller.

and fix

Hey, Jules, when you find a steering wheel puller for your '71 that will NOT
break the plastic surrounds of the steering wheel, be sure to share that
info with the list.


Bob Said:

&quot;I have never found a steering wheel that just sitting in the seat and
alternately pulling up on one side then the other that did not come off.
maybe a slight tap on the bottom with ye olde rubber mallet.  now I am
sure if Barry can't get it off then it is on pretty tight but I would
start with a little patience and pulling STRAIGHT up.
