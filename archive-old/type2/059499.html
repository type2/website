     Hi,
     1. I've searched all over but can no longer find the website that 
     features a 1970 Westy manual. Can someone direct me to that address?
     2. Is it possible to put the two-person upstairs sleeping arrangement 
     from a later loaf Westy in the earlier style pop-top that's hinged at 
     the front? 
     Thanks,
     Jim Wallace
