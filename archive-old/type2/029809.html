Volks,

Jamie just sent this to me and I agree, he is correct...  It gets very hot
in the brake area and it is too hot for nylocks, so I revert to peening
the threads on the bolt as the answer.  As I said, I am a big fan of the
pin and clip, and have a handful in my parts box (OK one of my parts boxes
:-) and pull out a pair when I need them.  I have never had one break, but
YMMV...  Nathan had it happen!

Hi Steve..

Nylock nuts are NOT a good recommendation,,,  the nylon gets hot and melts
during a heavy application of the brakes,,, such as a down hill grade,,,
I have found from experience that it DOES get toooo hot for nylock nuts,,

Peening is a good idea....... I used to put a spot of mig weld on the
factory shoulder fastener

Just thought I'd mention that
