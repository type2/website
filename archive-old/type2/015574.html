Good for you. It is the kind of job that takes attitude and tenacity. The
big problem I have with in-situ fan shroud removal is getting the back of
the shroud to fit the lower tin upon replacement. With the motor out, it
takes a minute or two. With the motor in, it MIGHT fall into place ok, or
it COULD take hours.

If you haven't already, I would replace the indicator bulb. Excess
resistance in the bulb or it's circuit can cause problems with Bosch
alternators. It is critical to correct function.
