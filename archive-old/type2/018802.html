We'll volunteer to do a leg from the Grande Ronde Valley (La Grande, OR, on
I-84) to either Ontario/Boise or north to Moscow, ID. 

But why only splits and loafs?  Vanagons are type2s too!  If we're going to be
anal about, we'll be sure to drive the loaf.

How about hitting a postoffice and getting a cancelation from each 'hand-off'
point?  Would have the date and locale. (Oh yeah... wouldn't work on weekends...)
