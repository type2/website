Subject: GA: PST End of Summer Campout this weekend!

Peach State Transporters is sponsoring a campout for all VW bus owners 
and their families at Duckett Mill Campground on Lake Lanier near 
Gainesville, GA, August 28-30th.  The campout is open to all VW 
enthusiasts &amp; their families.

The park is located off GA Hwy 53 about halfway between I-985 and 
GA Hwy 400 near Gainesville, Ga.

This campout is always a lot of fun.  The campsites are on a peninsula 
on the lake and you can swim right from your campsite.

You can call for campground information at (770) 532-9802.  Tonya Drake 
already called about reservations and it is &quot;first come-first serve&quot; at 
Duckett Mill (no reservations).  Don't worry that you won't be able to 
get a campsite if you come late, the camp hosts are always accomodating 
(except to Louise a few years ago) and allow us to double up on campsites.  
They do close the gate at 10-10:30pm, though, so don't get locked out.

There is information for Lake Lanier Corp of Engineer campgrounds at:

You can find all camping rates and rules &amp; regulations there.

I hope to see a lot of you there!

Dave
