Subject: Re: [T2]76 Brakes (update) HeLP~!~

Here's another easy trick for one-person brake bleeding.

Get a length of about 3 feet of clear hose that fits on the bleeder
nipple. Hook it up to bleeder then run the hose up and over the top of
your shock absorber for that wheel and then back down to your catch
jar.

Now open the bleeder, make sure your hose is secured and go up front
and start slowly pumping the brakes. Fluid and air will be forced out
of the bleeder, some fluid may be drawn back into the system, but
since air rises in brake fluid the air bubbles will go up and cannot
be drawn back into the system.

Simple and it works. If you're skeptical get a helper to work the
brakes while you observe.
