Subject: Re: [T2] Gross Polluters


&gt;I have heard this argument used by people who did not want to do their 
&gt;smog testing on several occasions for any car they drive (though I know 
&gt;that is not what you were implying, Eron, that statement just brought this 
&gt;into my head).  I will express my two cents here and hope I do not get slammed.

Good points!!!
