Subject: Type I engine in a 78


My friend came by this weekend with his 78 bay running a
rebuilt type I motor.  At first glance, the motor looked=20
and sounded real nice, had new heads, intake, pushrod tubes,
exhaust etc, not bad, a turnkey for $850. =20

Then we went for a ride.  Any thought I may have had of doing this
to my 79 went out the window before we even got into 4th gear.
I had to almost redline it in 3rd to get any pedal response
in 4th.  I could feel the engine straining trying to come up to speed=20
in 4th, it was almost hurtful knowing what that little guy was going
through.  Cruising speed felt OK, once we finally reached it.

I lectured my friend on the importance of getting cooling tins
fabricated, all met with a blank stare.  I even gave him a URL where
he could order some and offered to help him install them, but I don't
think it registered.  As he was leaving, I grimaced hearing that
nice fresh motor straining to get that beast moving.
