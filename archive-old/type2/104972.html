Subject: Pep Boys/ Oil Dump

Was Writ:
&quot;Another good thing about Pep Boys, last I heard, was that they'll let you
dump your used oil there.&quot;

It is my understanding, and correct me if I am wrong, that any business
selling oil must also accept waste oil for recycling/disposal. I know that
my wholesale supplier does, as well as all the auto parts stores in the
area.

Just my .02.
Dave
