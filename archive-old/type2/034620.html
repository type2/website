Subject: List sticker....another thought...

All,

If there is sufficient demand for a screened-logo
sticker (and the Admins approve), I will offer my
services to print them. I have literally thousands of
hours of experience in silk-screening (I used to own a
snowboard company).

The only problem; I no longer have any equipment to do
so. I estimate it would run about $150.00 for a
screen, squeegee, screen clamps and ink. It would run
about $30.00 for film and another $20.00-30.00 to
&quot;burn&quot; the screens. I would donate the vinyl, cleaning
supplies and my time (which would not be
insignificant). I will even design a few logos that we
can choose from and post them on my web-site.

Now, these wouldn't be die-cut, but I figure if we can
keep 30 year-old busses on the road, we ought to be
able to use a pair of scissors ;-)


If people want to throw some money together and make
this happen, let me know.

I would also want Admin approval before doing
anything. If the Admins would like to see this happen,
it could even be a money-maker (like $2.00 a sticker)
to off-set the cost of operations. 

Let me know what you all think...if it sounds
positive, I will get solid figures for setting this up
on next Tuesday (next day off).
