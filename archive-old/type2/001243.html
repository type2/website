Hey Everybody,

I recently restored and painted a 71 Weekender. In the process of replacing
door and window seals, I encountered a problem. The window scrapers and
rubber for the driver and passenger windows, including the vent windows, did
not fit. They are after market and I'm pretty sure the only ones available.
The place that sold them to me was very helpful and told me they should fit.
The rubber for the vent windows does not line up and the scrapers don't line
up on the inside of the door.

Has anyone encountered this problem before? Should I just customize the
parts I have to fit or maybe salvage these parts? Again, I don't believe
these parts are defective. I just can't install them properly. Any
suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

Bill.
