&gt; Mike,
&gt;
&gt; The '78 FI system should fire almost immediately when cold thanks to the
&gt; cold start valve. Actually, it is a pretty advanced system, it's just
&gt; attached to a very old design, the aircooled motor.
&gt;
&gt; I hope I'm not hijacking the thread here since I don't have the previous
&gt; posts:
&gt;
&gt; It sounds like your cold start valve is non operational or the harness
&gt; plug
&gt; is unplugged. I have had to wiggle the plug a little bit on mine after I
&gt; run
&gt; over rough roads and the plug (one clip is damaged) works loose.
&gt;
&gt;
I guess it is also important to know at what temperature you are trying to
start. IIRC, the CSV only activates when the temperature is below 50 degrees
or around there. So if you are in the mid 60s, the CSV wouldn't even be a
factor. But if it is ASS cold and you can't get a start, then your CSV is
definitely not working.

What temp is it outside when you are trying to start?

The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who
acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door, and deny Him by
their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds
unbelievable.
