hi scoob;

it's been 3 years since i've been into this shop - but the one that got me
up and rolling clean back to oregon w/o waiting was d &amp; k at 2551 s. rodeo
gluch in soquel. phone number is 831 457 9669. i believe that's real near
the drive-in and sweets in the nude (unfinished furniture).

if i ever have to break down, let it be in santa cruz.
