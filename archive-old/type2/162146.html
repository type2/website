Well, I am out of ideas and tests to do. Everything checks out as
excellent accept the coil will only give intermittent spark. I just do
not understand as it worked just fine a week and a half ago and then
kaput. I believe I am now just venting my frustration upon the list; I
apologize. Maybe I will have an epiphany in the next couple of hours.


Thanks for all of the help,



Max
