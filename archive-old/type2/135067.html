Subject: How many bolts hold on a '73 bumper

Can anyone out there with a '73 bus go out and look for me?
I need to know how many bolts hold the bumper blade to the brackets.
And how many bolts hold the bracket to the body.
I ordered by bumper blade and forgot to order bolts.
I cannot find my bumper brackets...I'm waiting for a warmer day to dig 
through my garage.
I want to get the hardward now, though, so that I have them for paint.

Peace,
