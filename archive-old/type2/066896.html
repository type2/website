Well, it's illegal in Colorado, and I suspect in most states (other
countries even more variable than the different US states).  The
reasons given here are:

- - may leak, thus asphyxiating occupants
- - may leak, producing an explosive mixture
- - in an accident, may leak or rupture, filling possibly-burning vehicle
  with an explosive mixture

Given all that, it is apparently legal to transport a small tank (20
pounds or less), as long as the valve is closed, the plastic safety
cap is screwed into the outlet, and the tank is secured.  Even so,
I usually get some hassling every time I get my tank filled (it's not
generally used with/in the bus, merely transported by it).
