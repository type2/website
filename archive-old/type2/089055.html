Subject: Re: [T2] 1970 westy~sliding door inside handle

[...]

Well, I have the 2 I took the pics of. But they are showing their age. The
left one especially. Yes, they are very hard to find. And finding one without
cracks is going to be almost impossible. Once they start to crack, they weaken
and self-destruct. That early bay double action rig-a-ma-roll you have to go
thru to open the door takes its toll on handles. VW got smarter later on and
made the action easier, only one movement needed to open the door.


&gt; Karl,
&gt; Thanks for the picture of the early bay Westy handle for the sliding
&gt; door (double ended). Now, here's the tricky part...does anyone know
&gt; where one is available?
&gt; A not-so-careful &quot;friend&quot; has broken mine into bits.
&gt; I have called VW salvage yards that I know of and cannot find a
&gt; replacement at all.
&gt; Thanks for any leads.
