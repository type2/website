Subject: Flasher Module for '70 bus
Message-Id: &lt;4.1.19990510085519.00949240_at_texas_dot_net&gt;

The flasher in my '70 Westfalia has opened it's raincoat too many
times. It will flash no more.

ITEM DESCRIPTION:
Square in shape, PC board inside a plastic housing
Markings:
BGE 200.876
12V 214 x 21W
211 953 215 C

Opening it up, I see 2 relays which test good.
I suspect the electrolytic capacitors in the R-C time constant circuitry.
They have probably dried up and gone to dead short, as the reaction
upon applying energy to the module is &quot;poof&quot; to the fuse when the
flasher switch is pulled or the turn signals are flipped.
The resistors shouldn't age , and appear to measure OK.
There are two other items on the board; diodes maybe?

Does anybody out there have...
1.
Schematic of the flasher module (with component values)?
2.
Flasher module for sale?
3.
Tips on how to convert over to the present day available &quot;can&quot; type
flasher modules using a can mount and spade lugs to plug into the
original mount configuration?

If beggars can be choosers, I prefer solution # 2 :-)

In the meantime...........

^   =  Right
I   =  Stopping
?  =  Intersection
