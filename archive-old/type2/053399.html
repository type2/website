The point of the cooling tin is not to direct hot air out of the compartment,
but rather get cool air over the critical parts of the engine so that it stays
cool.  Futhermore, the tin helps to keep hot air (from the engine itself) from
washing back over the engine as you drive, which could overheat the bus.  Do
not try to outsmart a VW cooling system.  VW engineers spent a lot of time
trying to make it work just like it does. Remember, it is an AIR COOLED
vehicle.

You need ALL the cooling tin.

BTW, if you're missing some pieces, I might be able to help you out.  I've got
some extra lying about, if you know what you need.  They're not pretty, but
with a bit of sandblasting and a coat of paint, they'd be lovely.
