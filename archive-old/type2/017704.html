This happened to me back in 95. I was renting a house with 3 other guys in a 
nice Long Island Neighborhood filled with familys and little kids. The nice 
families didn't appreciate coming home from the mall on saturday night to 
find me sitting at the curb with a living room lamp without the shade running 
out the front door to the street and me sitting in the street with a 2.0 
motor on the ground and parts everywhere. First a letter came from the town 
about unregistered vehicles on the property. Then came the eviction notice.  
I had 2 66s, a 73 and an 80, plus a 77 mercury marquis (same color and year 
as McVeighs, which didn't help, with a cardboard license plate) combine these 
with my roommates monster truck and various loud drilling and sanding 
operations emanating from the backyard and eviction quickly followed. I 
managed to save all but one 66, but as repayment I ran a yardsale on the last 
day, and sold all the furniture in the house that belonged to the owner. good 
luck and don't go down without a fight.
