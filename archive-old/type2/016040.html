Volks,

Time to appeal to the knowledge of the list.  I have searched the library and 
archives (when available), did a general search of the Net,  asked a couple 
of knowing list members, and am kinda stuck.

I am putting a 411 engine into my '73 Sunroof.  411 were originally FI, and 
the place for a manual pump isnot drilled out.  I am installing it as a dual 
carb set-up, as I have no means to convert the bus to be a FI system.  I 
purchased an electrical fuel pump and have installed it, and am ready to 
power it up.  HOWEVER, I want to do it so that it will shut off if the engine 
stops running... kinda figure that safety aspect is a good idea.  Picked up a 
realy from Radio Shack the has four pins.... 12V in, 12V out, (-), and (+) to 
a switched source.  The idea is that between the negative and the switched 
source, when power is applied, the relay closes and sends 12V to the fuel 
pump.

I thought that maybe that connecting the (-) and (+) to the coil would give 
me the proper operation....but I checked tonight and while there is no power 
between the poles of the coil when the ignition key is OFF, as soon as it is 
turned on, there is power (~11V), even when the engine isn't running....so 
that knocks down my idea of connecting to the coil.

So, question to you.... If you have/are running an electrical fuel pump with 
a dual carb system, AND have it set up to shut off when the engine shuts off, 
how did you do it???? and what relay(s) did you use??

There has to be a way to wire the pump so that it will shut off when the 
engine stops.

Zac, I know that you ran this engine for a bit... did you just have it wire 
to the (+) of the coil?

Any and all ideas considered and my thanks for what help is possible.
