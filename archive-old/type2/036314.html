Subject: Running funny when warm

Hi , 
    My god friend has a ' 76 bus. She took it to a shop on monday for a 
tune-uup because it was running funny. She also had the brake lights fixed, 
they were possed and would only work once in a while. Well we picked it up 
yesterday, we took it for a short drive to make sure all was well. It ran 
great , but on the way home (about a 30-40  mile drive)  it started to act 
up.  We were driving along and the further we went the worse it ran.. Almost 
like when it got hot it decided not to run good anymore. The guy who did the 
work put new points in it and cleaned the spark plugs, and he also re-set the 
timing. He did tell us that the plate with the timing marks on it was somehow 
missing , so he did the best he could.  I was looking through the archives 
and saw that some people had similar problems, and it was caused by a bad 
temerature sensor. I was just wondering if anyone could steer me in the right 
direction on this one. Thanks
