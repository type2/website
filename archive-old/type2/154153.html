Go for it. They have virtually identical advance. Plug the unused
retard nipple with a rubber cap to keep the inside clean.

And Mike replied
granted, I don't know the internal workings of the vacuum can, but wouldn't plugging one side of the can
impede the other side from working correctly?

And Tom wrote:
I wouldn't think so.  The &quot;retard&quot; side of the Federal distributor can has no nipple or access to the
atmosphere either.

Tom, your Fed vacuum unit is a single, advance only unit. Inorder for the diaphragm to move, it has to have
backside open to the atmosphere. It does this by being open to the inside of the distributor housing.

By using the Calif dual vacuum unit, you need to leave the retard side open to the atmosphere. Unless the
diaphragm ruptures, you will not be sucking crap into it.

I have been known to put a vacuum hose on it and just letting it go towards the front of the engine. Open to
the atmosphere and in a cleaner air enviroment......
