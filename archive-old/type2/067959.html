Subject: Want A List Coffee Mug??? -Reply

# 2 or #3 sound good to me.  Also I would like to put a list sticker on my
bus.  Is that an option? I got my t-shirt yesterday.  Great job.  My girlfriend
digs it, not so great.  How about a list baseball cap.  Maybe we could
form the Type II Merchandising Company.  I'm just kidding about the 
Company but I would really be interested in the mug, sticker and possible
cap (splittie on the lid) or a lid for your type of type II. Put the van in a
Steal your Face and you could probably sell another hundred. 

Once again Great Job Richard

By the way how did the rescue turn out from Bowie Md?
