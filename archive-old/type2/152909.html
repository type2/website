I'll admit to it; proudly.  It's hard to get into law school.

Think of it in &quot;Star Wars&quot; terms: There is a &quot;dark side,&quot; and a &quot;light
side&quot; to law.  I (want to) practice on the light side.  (Heard of the
ACLU?)

I'll also say, my Dad was an Army LTC &amp; lifetime bus driver.

So.  Can I help?  :)
