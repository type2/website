I know this will most likely develop into yet another conversation about
the fuel injection vs. carbs but I had to make this theoretical motorheaded
comment.

Personally I have had absolutely no experience at all with carburated 2.0
litre engines, but I have had some with fuel injected engines.  To add to
that, I have heard many people with progressive webers say that the damn
things are a hardstart in cold weather, well I guess what i have heard is
true.

In my humble fuel injected mind the best thing you can do is either get
another set of carbs (preferebly solex) or change the thing back to FI,
which was probably what it was designed to be in the first place.

Peace be with you and drive your damn busses!

Oh and don't wear gel in your hair, it messes up your headliner. : )
