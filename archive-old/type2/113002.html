&gt;
&gt; I live out on treasure island in san francisco and my starter is dead.
&gt;
&gt; anyone know of a place locally where I might be able to pick one up?

There's Kohlweiss in Redwood City and Buggy House (search on BH Motor Sports) in Hayward. You might also search for a rebuilder (alternators, starters, etc) because its been my experience that they usually have
them in stock and you can cut out the middle man.
