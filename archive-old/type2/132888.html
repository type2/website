Subject: RE: [T2] problems with removal of upper torsion arm

&gt;&gt;The upper
torsion arm is now butted against the rubber stop (which I probably
should have removed before I jacked up the car)...
...My understanding is that
the torsion arm should slide off, but its stuck on there. How do I get
it off? Sledge hammer? Any tricks I need to know about?&lt;&lt;

its been a while since i've done this but IIRC you'll need to get that
rubber bump stop off before you attempt to remove the arm.  you'll have to
get the tension/weight off the torsion arm before removing the stop.

can you slide a small jack in there &amp; push up on the torsion arm? or maybe
have a friend use a prybar to push it up so you can remove the rubber stop?
WARNING: watch your fingers!!!!!

once the rubber stop is off, you *should* be able to get the torsion arm off
with a prybar by pushing up &amp; the pulling towards you. again, be careful,
there is alot of tension on that spring/torsion leaves!

&amp; BTW the real hard part is getting it back on.

good luck,
