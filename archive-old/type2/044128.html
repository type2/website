Hi all,

We are feverishly getting ready for the hordes of Bus enthusiasts that are
about to descend on us during the Labor Day weekend for &quot;Busses Nowhere
Near The Arch&quot;  (a.k.a. Busses By The Arch).  Trophies and door prizes are
on their way, flyers have been mailed, we're assembling the registration
packets and our event equipment for loading in our vans, and the event
T-shirt artwork is heading for the printer this week.

A few event flyers came back as uneliverable (change of address, no
forwarding order, etc.).  I hate to leave these folks out of all the fun,
so I'll make one more effort to reach them.  So if you are one of the
following listed folks, or know them and can contact them, please send your
(or have them send their) new/current postal address to my e-mail address:
BussesByTheArch_at_compuserve_dot_com    and I'll re-mail their flyers to them.
Thanks!

Gary &amp; Stacey Byers (formerly from Kansas)
Chris Follmer (of Milwaukee, WI)
Valerie Stanford (formerly from Collinsville, IL)
Brian Dodson (formerly from Springfield, MO)
and Jerry Scilagyi (formerly from Wichita, KS)

The &quot;Cameron Cave&quot; private lantern light tours on Saturday are reserved,
the rangers are preparing the &quot;group use&quot; campground on Mark Twain Lake for
us, and everything looks great for a long weekend of VW camping fun.  We're
looking forward to seeing many of our old friends and their Type 2's again
very soon!  Now if I can just finish up the repair to this leaky rear axle
seal leak on my '67 so that it can attend too!  We'll see you there.

Bill
