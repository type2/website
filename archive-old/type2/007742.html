&gt; I am an American living in Belize. I am also a Legal
&gt;resident of Belize. If I purchase a Mexican van and have it registered in
&gt;my name in Belize would I be able to take it to the US on a vacation. Does
&gt;anyone have any info as to the lenght of time I could stay and what
&gt;paperwork would be required. The American councilate here has not a clue
&gt;and is not interested, it seems, in helping me find out. Any info including
&gt;just addresses to write to would be a big help. majortom_at_btl_dot_net

     I know it's possible, but I'm not sure of the specifics. I've read 
on the list that there's a fellow with dual residency, both in Santa 
Barbara (CA) and someplace in Baja California (Ensenada?), who owns one 
of these beauties. If I remember correctly, it was a 6mos time limit for 
the vehicle to be in-country, but I could be wrong. Might check with the 
folks at BeetleMex &lt;http://www.beetlemex_dot_com&gt;. They actually take 
american bugs, drag 'em to Mexico, strip 'em to the chassis, then put all 
new parts on the chassis. This gets around the US import laws, as it's 
technically the same vehicle, just fully restored. They might do the same 
thing for a bus, dunno. They also might have a clue who to ask about 
vacation type info, worth a shot anyway. Thier email is 
&lt;mailto:miguelpe_at_imparcial_dot_com.mx&gt;. Good luck...


Peace,
