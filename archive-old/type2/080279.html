&gt; Yes, all busses are type 2's.  Bugs are type 1's.  72 and later busses in 
&gt; the US have the &quot;type 4&quot; engine but they are still type 2's.  Make sense?  :-)

and to add to the fun the  bay window version is the type 2, type 2.

so I guess my 78 is a type 2 type2 with type4 engine.  confused yet??
