Subject: Window workings

After the generator-fan belt trauma, we had brake trouble with Broomhilda. 
Brakes were fixed this week, oil changed, valves adjusted, she was running sweet 
as could be, but when I parked at home and tried to roll up the window, 
surprise!  Window would not roll up.

Took off the door panel and discovered various rust and crud and corruption 
inside the door, but most importantly, the small rectangular metal part that 
held the glass in place had rusted and separated from the works that would 
normally lift and close the window.

So what is the name of this part, and how hard is it to find a replacement?  Is 
1971 window hardware as hard to get as other 1971 parts, or will the guts from 
another year work as well?

Thanks guys (remember: gorls are guys, too),

Evelyn
