Subject: Re: [T2] Hi Listers I'm Back!!! need engine info...

&gt; If it is an original bug case, then you will not have the 3 holes in the case below the crank pully for the
&gt; rear support bar.  There was a mickey mouse bar on the market that allowed you to use a bug engine in a bus,
&gt; but the bar used the tiny oil pump studs. NOT a good idea. I would never use one.

I have to disagree a little here Karl.
It does mount to the oil pump studs but also bolts through a lower case
bolt.
Given a choice of using a good bug motor with the bracket or spending over
1K for a new motor I would use the bracket.
Yes a bus motor is better. But the brackets work. Ive seen them in action
and have not actually seen one fail.
