Just got a call from Brad. The Van Hoy campground is a big place and we take 
up the woods in the back. The owner has allowed another group on the grounds 
this weekend. You guessed it, YEScamp'99 will be there also. 

http://web.cetlink_dot_net/~loulamb/yescamp99.htm (ignore their directions- they 
have moved into our area)

You have to check out this site, and people think bus owners are hippies. :-) 
I think I will make grilled cheese sandwiches :-))

Well, we did want some music for the event.

Can't wait.
