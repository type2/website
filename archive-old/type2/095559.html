&gt; &gt; Battery is still draining.

&gt; &gt;  when I removed the last wire, of course the

black
&gt; &gt; one and no drain...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So that's where I am now... process of elimination...  any suggestions
as
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; how to proceed?


Ok, fun day... not... lol,

Basically... the Bentley manual shows a brown, green and red wire going to
the voltage regulator... on my bus, the chamber containing the red wire also
has another green wire, which is actually connected (spliced) to a black
wire in that brown cable jacket... This entire jacket goes to the
alternator, another red wire in a brown jacket splits off from this one
before the alternator and contains one red wire which connects directly to
the solenoid. When I disconnect the voltage regulator my drain decreases
(from .01 every 30-60 seconds to .01 every 5-10 minutes.)  The voltage
regulator was just replaced several days ago...

I also discovered a wire which was connected to the solenoid, appears to be
coming from the front of the bus, it was in the same jacket as two thicker
red wires. This one was a thin red wire, it was completely
melted/disintegrated... It was barely connected and it came apart in my
hands when I was moving the wires around to get a better view.
