Subject: Re: [T2] sub-cultures

I saw a similar caption that said &quot;...No need to waste a perfectly good
fire extinguisher on a late model&quot;

I'm sure we'll be out of splits before we're outta bays.

&lt;snip&gt;
Us Bussers should always stick together no matter the model. I saw a
photo of a Bay on fire on some splittie's website - the caption read
&quot;Fortunately, it was just a bay.&quot; What's up with that?

&gt; Must be you're not driving a &quot;cool&quot; bus :) I also have two J**ps; a

&gt; 
&gt; Guess that's what makes world go 'round though. If we all liked the

&gt; 
&gt; The people in Atlanta are always nice when they talk to you, just bewildered
&gt; 
&gt; by the camper. In fact, while getting gas the other night, I had a
&gt; guy tell 
&gt; me that my &quot;car&quot; looked pretty good considering it was one of the first
&gt; VW's 
&gt; ever made.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I think it might be the area.  When I drive my Bus around (I'm 30
&gt; &gt;minutes -south- of Atlanta) I get strange looks, a couple waves, always
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;waves from other AC VW owners.  When I drove a Bus up in the Chicago
&gt; area, 
&gt; &gt;no one ever gave it a second look.  I also remember seeing more of
&gt; them up 
&gt; &gt;there...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;So what's up with hot 'lanta? I'm in california, self-described vw
&gt; hotbed, 
&gt; &gt;and busdrivers give me the shaft when I wave 8 times outta 10.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Course, this is self-described yuppie hotbed as well. Also, being
&gt; in the 
&gt; &gt;central valley, I sometimes think there's more rednecks here than
&gt; the whole 
&gt; &gt;south. Don't take kindly to non 4x4 modes of travel.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Yeehaw,
