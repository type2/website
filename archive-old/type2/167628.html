&gt; Huh---
&gt; With not much more than a 20% duty cycle outa that low dollar mig welder
&gt; it'll take one heck of a Craftsman to get any decent results----
&gt; You'll be working all of 20 minutes out of an hour --and napping for 40.

if I get to the point that I am actually welding 20 minutes out of any
hour I'll start looking......

that's the difference between you guys that are &quot;professional&quot; and the
rest of us mere mortals,  like I said if I can get down to under 40
minutes out of the hour grinding and get in more welding I'll be happy
