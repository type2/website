Subject: RE: [T2] oil leaks in upright bus engine

From what I have read these don't leak when combined with a high quality
silicone seal. They are much better than the questionable spring style. CB
Performance is pretty good with their products.

I might be installing these soon as well. My pushrod seals are leaky from
several head removals and besides they look cool.

  The bottom line is: I'd like to fix the pushrod tube leaks without pulling
the heads.  Any thoughts or advice?  Thanks, Greg
