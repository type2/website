Subject: 75steering lock / 76 asbestos?/78 engine install

76 heating asbestos? / 75steering lock / 78 engine install / 76 FI?

1) Asbestos - There are two plastic type tubes that connect the heat 
control box (device w/ flapper) to the tubing on the rest of the 
vehicle.  I believe this plastic interface is designed to deal w/ the 
motion of the engine.  However, since it is plastic and the heat 
control box can get very hot, there is an insulating material attached to 
the heat control box that appears to be asbestos??  I didn't think 
that asbestos would still have been used in 76 but...  Anyone know?  
The RMMW catalog has a good pict of a heat control box and it looks like a new 
design.

3) Randal Guest requested info on the steering lock - You can remove 
the steering lock from the column w/ some tedious work and minimal 
damage if you are careful.  Remove the steering wheel, unbolt the 
column from the dash, disconnect the wiring.  You may need to use a 
dremel or knife to release the plastic housing but try to  
pry it a part first.  On one side of the lock housing there should be a 
bolt.  You may be lucky and have a head on the bolt (allen) to work with or 
you may need to drill it out (any other suggestions?).  Then the 
assembly should slide up the column.  Reattach column to the dash, 
reattach the steering wheel and now you can direct the vehicle when 
moving and work on the 
ignition separately.  By examining a wiring diagram you can also hot 
wire the vehicle using the wiring harness from the ignition if you 
need to start it.

4) Ian Corner wrote about 78 engine installation.
My experience is that by not installing the fan housing(alt. 
included) , rear tin or oil filler neck prior to inserting the engine in the vehicle,
it is a lot easier.  Yes the top bolts for the engine/trans are a pain but the 
tin ware shouldn't be in the way(I know, I know... I'm not there).
  I've only pulled/installed the engine alone so I haven't wanted to
 lower the trans any for fear of a 
crashing thud!  It's easier for me to line up the engine w/ a floor 
jack and packing.  Slide it onto the trans input shaft and put the 
bearer bar on the bottom of the engine.  leave the jack in place 
while putting together the 4 bolts/nuts from engine to trans.  I also 
put the exhaust on the vehicle after the engine is in place (too much 
weight otherwise.  This may be a long way but it works easy (w/ love) 
for me when I'm working by myself. 

5) Question regarding 76-78 FI:
recently my vehicle has dropped in MPG slightly.  It sometimes has a 
difficult time starting after it has been driving for a little while. 
My only thoughts at this time is a stuck cold start injector making 
the A/F mix rich.  The air flow meter is new as is the fuel pump.  I 
don't suspect the brain (only because of fears from the price tag) And the timing is 
within specs- any thoughts?
