&gt; 	I searched the list archives and got a few ideas (buslab in berkeley

I don't know of any air-cooled shop actually located in San Francisco.  
Possibly closer to you is Tassi's, in Colma, but I don't know if he 
still works on air-cooled (but he does come highly recommended).

&gt; 	For background, I limped my red 1975 Riviera down from Seattle back 
&gt; in August and have been avoiding street sweeping tickets while saving 
&gt; money to get my baby running right. I'd attempt the project myself 
&gt; (engine drop to replace seals, install new gas tank, and troubleshoot 
&gt; and electrical issue), but have nowhere to work.

I have the same problem.  In fact, I had to have my bus towed to 
Berkeley just last week to get a clogged fuel tank problem dealt with 
(I take it to Buslab when I don't have the space to do the work myself, 
or if I am under serious time pressure).

&gt; 	So, if you've got suggestions for quality shops (I've got some $$ 
&gt; saved) or maybe a garage/driveway and a bit of spare time to help a 
&gt; new bus owner with his first engine pull...let me know.

I would not hesitate to suggest Buslab.  I would also suggest calling 
Tassi's.

I would love to be able to offer garage/driveway space, but 
unfortunately I don't have that space to offer (I too have to do the 
Street Cleaning Shuffle with my Bus).  However, if you do find space in 
the city for doing your own work, I would certainly be willing to offer 
a helping hand.

And, if you're ever interested in just meeting for beers to talk about 
Busses, well, or are interested in Bus group camping trips once you're 
up and running again, I've been trying to find San Francisco folk who 
are interested in doing that!
