Ken,

I'm glad I'm not the only one with this problem! I've *never* been
able to get mine to run worth a damn. I had a mechanic that could get
it to run reasonably well (it STILL had that annoying flat spot), but
I have since moved.

Ironically, I was just thinking about posting the same question to the
list as you did when I saw your post! I was a little reluctant, as I
didn't want to sound like a newbie, so you made me feel a little better.

Mine also has the endearing trait of leaking fuel about two months
after a rebuild. Not enough to be dangerous, but certainly annoying.
The rebuilds (one by me, two by professionals) were done properly and
with genuine VW kits, though I don't know if they were German or
Brazillian.

If it makes you feel any better, it sounds as if you have a better
carb than I do :-(

 PS- it's good to see you taking part in the list now that you don't
have to babysit so much;-)
