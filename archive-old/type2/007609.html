&gt; Hey Y'all,
&gt;  I have a 70 Bus that I am keeping and a 74 Bus that I am parting. I
am 
&gt; trying to decide what I need to keep for my 70.
&gt;  Are the steering boxes the same exept for the steering wheel
splines? 

No, the steering boxes changed between 72 and 73 (as I recall!)  The
old boxes are worm and peg, the newer ones worm and roller.

&gt; If I swap wheels will it work?

No.  Won't fit the frame.
