The Porsche engines were mostly overhead cam engines and made to really 
sing compared to our VW pushrod engines.

I read 5400 for a redline somewhere (on the Type IV) and I guess I'll keep 
mine well under that.

Drive it however you like, but I bet the slower you run your engine 
(without lugging it) the longer it'll last.

I too listen for the fan to sing on the Type engines I have driven/owned.

It's been so long since I drove my '78 Westy (paint job, etc.) I don't know 
when I shift it.

&gt;I personally practice the &quot;make it sing&quot; method of revving through my gears.

&gt;The engine in the Mothership seems to like to reach that level of rev that
&gt;actually makes a certain whir.  Sort of like the same sound you hear when a
&gt;porsche engine winds out.
&gt;
&gt;Hmmm....since the type 4 engine and the older porsche engines are very
&gt;similar, why not consuilt what they recomend on the rev thing.
