Listees:

I wanted to send a quick THANK-YOU to fellow type2 listees Sean Bartnik and 
Brendon Allen for posting the VW portions of their Sunday Classifieds to the 
group.

I am searching for a VW Type 181 in the Southeast and have been monitoring 
your Newsgroups for some leads...  I have found these posts very informative 
and helpful.  Please keep them coming!

After living in very moderate climates for the last five years - AZ and NC - 
I am moving to the midwest this summer and need to buy a real vehicle...  
Don't think I'll get away with a motorcyle as my sole transportation for a 
Kansas winter...

Thanks again for your posts - all leads appreciated!
