Subject: [T2] Weird question

Hello fellow listees!
I have a question. Some buses have a removable body piece behind the bumper 
that is removed to help facilitate the removal of the engine. Mine doesn't 
have this. I was thinking about cutting out the same place in my bus, and 
replacing it with a piece of metal that can be bolted into place. Has anyone 
done this? Does it sound reasonable?
Thanks,
Matthew Santori
