Subject: Re: Ruminations on heating a VW bus

Here in California, we only see cold weather in photos. ;^)

However, in addition to uncontrollable VW bus lust, I am also a fan (and
owner) of a BMW motorcycle or two.
Us BMW folk use an electric vest that plugs into the bike. (How else
would we be able to ride twelve months out of the year?)
I simply installed the same DIN plug onto my bus, and plug in. Voila!
Instant toasty warm, no more frozen cajones.

Electric vests are available from
