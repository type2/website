Subject: Re: [T2] tire dis-information

&gt;&gt;Any chance of getting any 185-R14 or 185-R15 in a D load range?&lt;&lt;

AFAIK the Yoko 356 is available in C &amp; D load range.

try tirerack_dot_com (no, i dont work for them, etc.)

also, once upon a time i had the Bridgestone 603V in D load range.  didnt
have that bus very long after that but the short time i had them i did
think they were a good product.

YMMV.
