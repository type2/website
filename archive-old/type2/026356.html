	I too have coilovers on the rear of my bus.  I stole them from a
dying loaf at the wrecking yard.  There was nothing wrong with my tortion
bars, I was just looking for a little more suspension stiffness in the rear.
They make the bus a bit more 'predictable' on the road.

I saw recently in an older VW publication, that VW offered coilovers as
an accessory.

So, if in fact Melissa has them on the rear of her bus, it doesn't
necessarily mean there is anything wrong with her torsion bars, it just
might have been an added feature at the time of delivery.
