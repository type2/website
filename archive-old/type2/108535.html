From: &quot;Eric W. Bradway&quot; &lt;eric_at_bradway_dot_net&gt;
&gt; Was it because of the groud strap on the transmission?

No, actually.  It looks like simple failure from wear.  I'm not sure why it
broke in the middle, except that the rubber boot is missing at the front end
and may have let a lot of nasty stuff into the tube.

&gt; Oh, how I wish! A VW shop in walking distance!

Literally 15 minutes down the street on foot (through a nice area), 3
minutes driving (mostly starting out and stopping).  &quot;(Darrell) Robertson's
Import Parts and Repair&quot;.  Really nice guy, and a local club member, too.
