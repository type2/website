&gt; 	The STBs entourage will be leaving from the North San Fernando
&gt; Valley fairly early Friday morning and travelling out the 14/138 around the
&gt; Mojave desert side of the San Gabriel mountains.  A breakfast break is
&gt; scheduled for The Pines Cafe on the 138 (Pearblossom Hwy in Little Rock a
&gt; little west of Four Corners)

This is actually on the &quot;Pearblossom cutoff&quot; which is not yet the 138.
From the 14 north take the Pearblossom exit.  You'll go downhill, cross
the aqueduct, pass a couple more lights, and you will see the Pines on the
left side of the road.  If you get to the big intersection at 4 corners,
you have gone too far

 and ultimately picking up the I-15 at
&gt; Victorville.  From there we will be heading north on I-15 to Barstow and
&gt; then out I-40 to points east.  Mike Visket and myself will be on GMRS/FRS
&gt; Channel 2 for short range communications,

...

&gt; If George Lyle is travelling with us, he will no
&gt; doubt have some kind of double-secret, high-tech mega-serious radio gear and
&gt; will be able to contact bay pilots driving UFOs in from the orbit of the
&gt; moon...  George - feel free to chime in here on map routes, directions,
&gt; and/or radio specifics :-)

I'll be on FRS too.  I usually listen out on 40m (7288kHz) on the hour and
monitor 146.52MHz simplex otherwise.  Big things are planned for after we
get to Havasu, as we will be running a special event station with the
special callsign &quot;W7V&quot;.  Any hams (or even non-hams!) who would like to
help operate please get in touch or drop by at the event.  Look for the
extension ladder mast!
