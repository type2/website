Subject: Re: [T2] '68 Panel Part Needed (fwd)

Hi Gregory,

This should be an off the shelf part from Just Kampers (www.juskampers_dot_com) or Alan Schofield (www.ahschofield.co_dot_uk). They both have on line catalogues

Good luck

&gt; Subject: '68 Panel Part Needed
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; A friend of mine recently acquired a really cool but rusty 1968 Bay
&gt; Window Double Door Panel Bus.  This is a Panel Van with a sliding door
&gt; on BOTH sides of the vehicle.  The left hand (LH) lower rocker panel is
&gt; eaten away pretty bad with rust, to the extent that the track that
&gt; supports the bottom sliding door roller is gone.  He needs a repair
&gt; panel to fix it, and is having a hard time coming up with it.
&gt; 
&gt; He has ordered and acquired the follwoing part:
&gt; 
&gt; 211 801 672 D  Runner for Sliding Door, Right Lower
&gt; 
&gt; NONE of my parts catalogs show the equivalent part for the LH side of
&gt; the vehicle.  I'm guessing that the number is something very close to
&gt; that for the RH side part; something like this:
&gt; 
&gt; 211 801 673 D, or
&gt; 211 801 671 D.
&gt; 
&gt; I tried to verify both of these possibilities by searching the online
&gt; parts database at busdepot_dot_com, but I got nothing for either of these
&gt; numbers.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, I know that Busses in the UK, where Volks drive on the wrong side
&gt; of the road [;-)] , have sliding doors on the LH side of the vehicle.  I
&gt; bet that you Brits have access to these repair panels.
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone supply me with the part number I need?  How about a supplier?
&gt; 
&gt; Since I am not a member of the Type2 list, please send your responses to
&gt; the email address below, or give me a call.
&gt; 
&gt; Many Thanks!!
