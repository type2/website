Subject: Re: Tool storage locations

I have struggled with storing all this stuff as well.  This is what 
worked for me recently in my '71 Campmobile on a 12 day 4,200 mile 
jaunt to the left coast.

Under the rear facing seat were the portabathroom, jackstands, three 
small boxes with various small spare parts and spray cans, brake 
fluid, gear oil, motor oil, rags.

Under the forward facing seat were the sockets, drill, gas can, saw, 
tire pump, more oil, used oil, two boxes full of spares and odd tools.
I could have made better use of this space, probably.

In the side cabinet I had the cook stove, three more small boxes with 
spares, jumper cables, oil changing pan.

Now, for the tool boxes.  I have two of the medium sized Craftsman 
three drawer models.  Probably more than I need to carry on a trip but
I imagine I will size them down over time.  One of these fit nicely 
between the front seats and the other between the ice box and the rear
facing seat.  An added feature of this installation is that my bus 
sits level with that added weight up front.  We didn't really lose the
walkthru as the boxes can be easily stepped upon.

The rear cabinet was bedding and some clothes.  Hope this is of some 
interest to someone.  Jim
