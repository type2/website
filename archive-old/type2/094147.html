Subject: Re: [T2] speedo cable

&gt; When I bought my bus a couple months ago the speedometer didn't work and the
&gt; po told me that all I needed was a new cable. When I drive around I have the
&gt; cable unhooked from the actual speedometer and the little thing in the cable
&gt; does not turn. So my question is do i only have to replace that one cable
&gt; because i have gone to some junk yards and I have noticed that There is the
&gt; cable running from the speedometer to a small box that is way behind the
&gt; front kick panels. So I guess my final question is are there two Speedometer
&gt; cables (one from the speedometer to the small box then to the wheel) or just
&gt; one that goes straight to the wheel. thanks

It sounds like the junkyard bus has an EGR box.  Not positive because I
don't have one, but it's sole purpose could be to turn on a warning light
reminder to check the EGR system after 15,000 miles have gone by and that's
all.  If you don't have one, don't worry about it.

If the cable isn't turning you could check the left from wheel hub to see if
the cable is attached to the dust cover in the hub.  On mine, there should
be a little silicone nipple and underneath is a cable poking through a
square opening in the hub and it is held in place by a circlip.  If it's not
attached there it's not going to spin.  Have more silicone available to
reaffix everything.

Otherwise, the cable may be broken in the middle somwehere because of wear
due to over-bending, no lube, etc.
