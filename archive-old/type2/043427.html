Subject: Bike Rack

We are about to take our 76 Westy out camping for the first time this
weekend.  We want to take my son's bike so we are in need of a bike rack.
Preferably one that goes on the front but would clear the spare tire.  Any
recommendations?

     Also, any ideas on how to hold a 8' X 10' foot tarp to the the bus?  I
have some aluminum peice that bolts to the drip rail.  It is obvoiusly for a
tarp or tent.  It goes about 10' along the side of the bus.  Thanks for any
ideas.
