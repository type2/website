&gt; &gt; &gt; Across the top of the shirt will be the word

&gt; &gt; Please please make that &quot;U&quot; an umlaut there!  The German word for
&gt; &gt; pleasure is &quot;Vergnugen&quot;.  I'd love to have a List T-Shirt, but
&gt; &gt; I'd hate to run around with a spelling error.  I believe that Volkswagen
&gt; &gt; also used the umlaut in their Fahrvergnugen ads.
 &gt;
 Just so that everyone may rest easy, there *are* umlauts over the u on the
 shirt. Alas, I can't type them in on the computer here. If you look at the
 pictures of the old design, (see my webpage) you can see them happily there. I
 had several years of German in high school and college, so I do try to get
 things as accurate as possible. VW did indeed use the umlauts in their
 campaign, as did the high school german club, who used Deutschvergnu:gen =
 as
 their slogan.
 Sorry to have carelessly caused this confusion.
 Danke fu:r ihren Zeit,
