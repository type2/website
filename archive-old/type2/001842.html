Hey Folks,

I have a rather serious oil leak right where the funnel where you add oil
connects to the motor.  Although, I can't tell if it is actually coming
right from there or just above it.  I can see oil flowing out of there
though.

Anyone have any idea what this might be?  Until last week, my bus rarely
dripped much less spewed oil.

Does anyone know of a good VW Mechanic near Nashville?

I appreciate the help.

Sincerely,

Darrin K. Pierce
