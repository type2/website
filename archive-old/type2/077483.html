Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof solutions for former poptop campers??

Andrew - can you post the information on the company
in England? 

There's a company here that makes aftermarket ragtops,
but I can't say I'd recommend them, since the two
installations I've seen sag badly.

&gt; Hi Bryan,
&gt; No one seems to be answering your questions so even
&gt; though I can't refer you to any particular companies
&gt; I
&gt; can tell you that there are a couple of firms that
&gt; make ragtop style sunroofs for buses that formerly
&gt; had
&gt; poptops.
&gt; The only one I have info on is in England but surely
&gt; there must be a firm in the US that does the same
&gt; thing or is willing to try it.
&gt; The firm in England custom fits the roof to the size
&gt; of the existing hole...result:no welding or other
&gt; hassles.
&gt; Surely someone here knows of a company that does
&gt; this
&gt; in the US.
&gt; :-)

&gt; &gt; This is crazy, but...  Anybody out there know of
&gt; any
&gt; &gt; conversions or good
&gt; &gt; how-to's for the roof of the campers?  Here's the
&gt; &gt; deal:  I have found what
&gt; &gt; seems to be a very good deal on a '70, pretty good
&gt; &gt; shape, needs a few of the
&gt; &gt; panels worked on, but runs great.  -Will need a
&gt; &gt; clutch soon, but that is no
&gt; &gt; big thing either.  I have always wanted a bus,
&gt; just
&gt; &gt; not a camper.  The roof
&gt; &gt; just does not fit into the style bus I see myself
&gt; &gt; with in the end.
&gt; &gt; -However it is not likely that I'll find an
&gt; equally
&gt; &gt; good deal on any other
&gt; &gt; VW.  $400 in this case.  So, I'd like to make it a
&gt; &gt; rag top, or just fill it
&gt; &gt; in.  I'm sure I could fabricate something to
&gt; &quot;patch
&gt; &gt; the roof&quot; and welding is
&gt; &gt; okay for me.  But if there is a known solution,
&gt; I'd
&gt; &gt; certainly like to get
&gt; &gt; the info before my purchase on Friday.  Any help
&gt; or
&gt; &gt; comments are greatly
&gt; &gt; appreciated.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
