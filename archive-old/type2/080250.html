&gt;  I am 20 yrs old and I own a 1978 automatic vw transporter(bus). I
&gt; bought it a few months back. The previous owner gave me paper work
&gt; stating they had a used engine installed with a single ford carb. I've
&gt; been informed by the mailing list that the original engine was fuel
&gt; injected. Regardless it ran fine, started fine, took off fine and
//
&gt; by hand. He told me the motor had seized. So I had the motor
&gt; replaced. Just the motor. Now when I drive my van. I can't step on the
&gt; gas and go. It has to warm up for a bit and even then the gas has to be
&gt; pressed on with the touch of a feather. If you press on the gas too fast
&gt; it will cut off, if warmed up then it stalls then ju
&gt;  mps up to speed and still might cut off. when i do actually get it
&gt; going, it drives fine and transmission shifts fine. when i get it
&gt; started

OK, the auto transmission bus is different than the stick in how it is
tuned and what connections need to be made.  that said, it sounds like
somehow the former owner got it working alright, and that the current
mechanic isn't quite sure how to do it, my 78 with auto tranny still has
the fuel Injection so this may not apply in all cases... the 009 or other
mechanical distributor does not work well with the auto tranny because
when you put it in gear it slows down the engine (This is normal and
designed in)but it causes a mechanical dizzy to drop down and loose
rpm.  it is a catch 22, each causes the other to slow even more. (does
that make sense)
 when he changed the engines did he use ALL of your old &quot;stuff&quot; from the
original engine??

  I would certainly begin a search for the fuel injection components for
that engine.

good luck, unfortunately because it is a non standard engine it could be
real difficult to find the culprit, (20 hours to find, 20 minutes to fix)
