&gt; OK, here's the deal, and thank you to all of you who have responded to my
&gt; questions (all right, pleas!).
&gt;
&gt; Good to go, right?  Wrong!  A test with the voltmeter between the positive
&gt; battery terminal and the positive battery wire was 12 volts.  According to
&gt; Josh, it should be zero.  A ground somewhere.  Where? Maybe we rewired the
&gt; alternator poorly?  We checked everything else so out it comes.  It's fine.
&gt; We double check everything and put it back in.  I take the wires off the
&gt; starter - seems OK.

take all the fuses out, (note which ones go where.)
now check the power should be zero.
if it isn't you have a wiring short between battery and fusebox

if zero put the fuses back in one at a time seeing if  you still get zero
if you put a fuse in and you get power then it narrows down where you have
to look. and in an emergency you could probably drive with that fuse
removed until you can find the problem.

as others have mentioned things like clock etc draw power all the time.

good luck. electrical problems have to be the hardest.
5 days to find, 5 minutes to fix
