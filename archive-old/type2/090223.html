Richard, it's a holy war, I tell you... Louis vs. Sulimein all over again!
Crusade vs. jihad! :-)

&gt; The Bentley shows similar temperature ranges for 20w50 and 15w40.  What's
&gt; the advantage of using 20w50?

The numbers on a can of oil read as follows:  the first number, usually
followed by a W is the viscosity at room temp (70 degrees fahrenheit)  the
W means &quot;winter&quot; and says it will still pour at freezing temps.  The
third number is the viscosity at ~250 degrees fahrenheit.  If there is no
third number, then the first number is also the viscosity at 250.

Thus a 20W-50 oil protects like a  20 weight oil at room temperature and
like a 50 weight oil at 250 degrees,  a 15W-40 oil protects like a 15
weight oil at room temperature and like a 40 weight oil at 250 degrees. An
sae30W oil protects like 30 weight at room temperature and like a 30
weight oil at 250 degrees.  An sae30 oil does the same, but may not pour
at freezing temps.  I believe it is *possible* to find an SAE30 oil but it
is a challenge :-)

&gt; Also, I asked someone about a single grade oil like 30 and 40 but they said
&gt; it has a hard time circulating.

IMHO, this is pure bull.

&gt; What's good for our TypeIV engines?

Well, yes...  err... I dunno :-)  My religious belief is that I used to
run 20W-50 year round.  We had an oil thread last fall, tho that changed
my mind.  Karl, who I respect greatly, opined that at 250, the multigrade
oils may protect like the second number for a bit, but that the multi-vis
additives broke down quickly and you were left with straight weight oil of
the loser viscosity index.  This did match my experience, so this spring I
changed to straight weight SAE50W and in the fall I will change it to
SAE30W.  This is new to me, but so far it is working out.  We are just
starting into the 90/90 (90 degrees, 90% humidity) days here, so the
experiment is still running.
