Subject: Re: [T2] Tire Question (Donning asbestos flame suit now)

Since the flames may be deflected elsewhere: Has anyone ever used or even
heard of a tire called the Winstar. I think its made by kelley, but I can't
find it online. My local dealer can get it. It is supposed to be an 8-ply
for $53 plus $15 for mounting and balancing.
Later,
