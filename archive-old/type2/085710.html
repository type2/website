&gt;
&gt;Use grease to make it slide easier.  Place the bushing
&gt;on the stabilizer bar first.  Then grease the link.
&gt;Bend in part of the lip of the bushing inside the link
&gt;and press the rest on.  Push it on a little extra, and
&gt;the rest of the lip will pop back out.

&gt; &gt; Happy Friday Everyone !!
&gt; &gt; Okay so I have an 80 westy that came without the
&gt; &gt; driver side stablizer link or bushings.  I got all
&gt; &gt; parts but can't seem to get the lower bushing
&gt; &gt; thought the little hole.  Any body have any
&gt; &gt; suggetions on how to get it in.  Any help on the top
&gt; &gt; one would be great as well. Also should these
&gt; &gt; questions (body front end ect..) go to the vanagon
&gt; &gt; list or type 2 because it is air cooled? Hoping to
&gt; &gt; take it on its first camping trip this weekend about
&gt; &gt; 50 miles away. :)
&gt; &gt; Thanks
&gt; &gt; Kevin
&gt; &gt; 80 Westy
