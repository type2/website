Howdy volks folks, it's Mr Bill. I'm in search of a 71 westy or other camper
in the northern Cailf. area. I guess that makes me a wanabe, but having
owned a bus in the past, I at least remember the good feelings of the type
II.  I'll be gleaning info from the list and want to say thanks in advance
for any help in my search. Mr Bill
