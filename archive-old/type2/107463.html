Subject: 74 Westy airconditioning

I would like to know of souces for a/c for a westy camper. I am restoring
one at the moment and in the south you need a/c. I had an 84 with a/c that
was over the bed in the back and frankly it was excellent. The only problem
was part of the coils were over the back rear bed just inside the hatch area
and after a few years the condensation from those began to warp the rear
paneling there. But since you only saw it when you opened the hatch
door...it was not a problem.

Someone on the list referred to overhead a/c apparently up front.

I would also like to find the compressor and other parts used.

thanks..
