Subject: Dellorto carb experiences (long, technical)

History:  I've had these Dellorto DRLA 40 dual carbs on my bus for 
somewhere approaching 10k miles now.  When I got them, the jets (main and 
air-correction) were hogged out, way out.  Drove okay but mileage was 
unacceptably low and I was worried about the detrimental effects of running 
the engine so rich.

Several months ago I obtained new jets.  These carbs have 34mm venturis and 
I installed the recommended (by CB Performance, arguably the authority on 
these carbs on a VW) 140 mains and 180 AC's.  Then I did some freeway 
mileage tests and found that I could get nearly 20mpg at a steady 
55mph.  That was good, but there was a new problem.  A flat spot off idle 
which felt very much like the dreaded 009 flat spot.  I checked that 
everything else was within spec and couldn't resolve the problem.  Next I 
called CB Performance back and they suggested that I increase my idle jet 
size.  I ordered 65 idle jets to replace the 60's that were in there but 
left them on a shelf until a couple of weeks ago.

After installing the new idle jets, I wish I had done it much sooner.  The 
flat spot was reduced to more of a slight bog and my around-town mileage 
went up 1-2mpg.  Now getting 16 consistently, which is about the best city 
mileage my bus has ever gotten.  I'm wondering if going up to 70 on the 
idle jets would be even better.

I got to thinking about the flat spot and wondering why it was there.  I 
figured that it must be the emulsion tubes but CB performance verified that 
the ones I had were okay.  When I installed the Dellortos in place of the 
stock Solexes, I saw a big decrease in manifold vacuum.  At idle, the 
reading was similar to before but when you start opening the throttle with 
the Dellortos, the vacuum drops off quickly to zero whereas with the 
Solexes the curve was not as steep.  To give you an example, with the 
Solexes at 60mph on level ground I might see 7-8in, while with the 
Dellortos I see 2-3in.  This never worried me because I knew why it was 
happening.  Partly because of the much larger throttle plates and venturis, 
and maybe partly because vacuum comes from only a single cylinder vs. all 
four cylinders with the Solexes.  (The Dellortos are a 
single-cylinder-per-barrel design while the Solexes are two-cylinders-per 
barrel.  Two-cylinder-per-barrel designs have some design issues that 
necessitate plumbing the intake manifolds together, which is what allows 
you to draw vacuum from all four cylinders).

This sharp dropoff of the vacuum curve is, I believe, at least partly 
responsible for the flat spot.  I don't know why it took me so long to 
realize it.  Because of the sharp dropoff of the vacuum, I am getting 
little or no vacuum advance at part throttle, which reduces the function of 
my distributor to that of (suprise suprise) an 009.

I have a couple of questions that I really don't expect to get answers to, 
but here goes anyway:

1)  Why haven't people with Dellorto DRLA carbs complained about this before?

2)  What would happen if I plumbed all of my intake manifolds 
together?  (I'm half convinced I wouldn't see any more vacuum from doing 
this, but would it make the engine run worse?)

I am thinking about going with smaller venturis (I can get 32's) and main 
jets along with possibly upping the idle jets another notch.  This will 
cost me around $80 for parts - an expensive experiment.  I should say that 
the bus drives pretty darned well right now.  Most people probably wouldn't 
even notice the slight bog.  I'm tempted to just leave it as is, but I'd 
like to find that last bit of driveability.  And for the anal-retentive 
stock-or-its-crap types, yes I know I'm basically in uncharted waters, and 
I can live with the consequences of my actions.  I do have a vague idea of 
what I'm doing so spare me your lectures - thanks.  :-)

Any constructive comments are appreciated as always.

-David
