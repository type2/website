Subject: Re: [T2] Engine turns no start

Bill,

Well, it sounds like your distributor drive is installed incorrectly, but
because I know, from your previous posts that this is a new rebuilt
engine, I am going to start from scratch.  For now, humor me and let's go
back to square one...

To check that all the parts are aligned correctly, take out the spark
plugs, take off the right hand valve cover, and rotate the engine
clockwise until the intake valve (toward the cventer of the head) just
closes.  At that point, your cam is very close to TDC for #1.  Now go back
to the back of the bus and look at the timing mark and scale.  Is it
close?  If it is, then your crank is close to TDC as well (this is really
really good! :-)  turn it until it is exactly on the 0 -TDC mark on the
scale.  Take a dowel about 10&quot; long and as big around as a pencil (in fact
the eraser end of a new pencil is an *excellent choice! :-) and slip it
into the #1 spark plug hole.  have someone turn the engine back and forth
a bit.  Do you feel the piston?  come up to the top and rverse direction
as the mark passes TDC?  GOOD!!! :-) Look at the distributor.  When the
crank is lined up at TDC, is the rotor anything like lined up with the #1
mark on the rim of the case?  Can the distributor be rotated until it is?
If so, then the distributor drive is installed (roughly) correctly.

If during this procedure, you found any of the following
problems:                          do this:

intake valve just closed but       Call your rebuilder.
timing mark is more than 10        someone forgot to play &quot;match
degrees out                        the dots&quot;

pencil drops in, no piston         Call your rebuilder...  they forgot
fealt                              to install the pistons!!! :-)
                                   (actually, the cam is *probably*
                                   installed 180 out)

Intake valve closed, timing        Your distributor drive gear is
mark lines up, but                 installed incorrectly
dist case mark is *way* out

Look at the picture in Bentley.  Page 24 of the engine section.  Note that
on T1 engines, the drive gear gets installed so that the larger lobe on
the top of the gear is toward the front of the bus and the slot is
perpendicular to the centerline of the engine case.  Note that on T4
engines the larger lobe gets intalled facing toward the center of the
engine and the slot is angled at what Bentley calls 12 degrees to the
centerline of the engine (I think 11 o'clock and 5 o'clock :-)  There are
lots and lots of mechanics out there who have been working on VW engines
since they were able to walk who have learned from time out of mind that
the slot gets put perpendicular to the case seam and they do that with
every engine they meet.  Which is WRONG for the T4!

There are two solutions to this problem (well, three if you count sending
it back to the rebuilder :-).  The correct way to do it is to lift the
drive gear, rotate it to the correct position and reinstall it.  The
problem with this correct way of doing it is that there is a washer
between the bottom of the drive gear and the case.  I have watched John
Anderson do this and I have done it once.  In neither instance did we have
any problems, *but*...  if that washer slips out, you have to split the
case to retrieve/reinstall it!  It is a bit of a risk, up to you whether
to take it.

There is a second &quot;cheat&quot; way to handle the problem, however...  On all VW
engines since 1970 (doghouse oil cooler T1 and all T4), the four
distributor posts are spaced at 90 degrees.  THEY DON'T CARE which spark
plug wire sits on which post (which many of us have found out at one time
or another, to our chagrin :-)  So... move the dist until the vacuum can
is right in the middle of its free space.  Put the distributor cap on it
and see which post is closest to the rotor when the engine is at TDC for
#1.  *That* post gets the #1 spark plug wire!  4-3-2 get put in their
respective places and static time it to 7.5 vor.  That ought to be good
enough to get you started, then time it with a light.
