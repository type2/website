Subject: Re: [T2] New Carb Question

Hi,

Thanks for the tips Andy! The float appeared OK, no cracks, not full
of fuel. The spacer under the float valve was wrong (large spacer
instead of the smaller spacer). I also replaced the float valve with a
solex valve I've had soaking in carb cleaner for a few months.

Now I can get the engine up and running, but only until the choke
fully opens then she dies.

Suggestions?

thanks
Jules

&gt; my bet is that the float valve is not sealing.
&gt; perhaps...
&gt; the float is cracked and full of gas or
&gt; the float level is set wrong or
&gt; the washer/spacer under the float valve is not right or
&gt; the float valve itself just leaks.
&gt; the valves in the rebuild kits have been very spotty in my experience.
&gt; i keep reusing old og solex valves that I know work right and tossing the
&gt; ones in the rebuild kit.
