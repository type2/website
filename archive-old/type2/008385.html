&gt; I was underneath my 76 Westy last weekend doing some checking and I
&gt; grabbed the left axle and shook it. It wiggled it a bit between the
&gt; &quot;hub&quot; that sticks directly out of the transfer case. I did the same to
&gt; the right axle and it didn't move at all.
&gt; 
&gt; Sounds like something's loose inside my tranny - on the left side.
&gt; Any suggestions?

If the axle moves in the axial direction it's OK.  If it moves in the
radial direction, you have a bad CV, but it would have told you by now
by making noise.
