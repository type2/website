Subject: lights/radio update

ok, i couldn't wait so i dug in there and started tracing wires. it 
appears that the stereo is hooked up thusly:

Stereo Battery wire -&gt; mounting plate for an old CB -&gt; headlight switch
Stereo Ignition wire -&gt; same circuit as accessory gauges [oil temp/pressure]

so, it looks like PO wired the stereo into the power circuit that a 
PPO wired into the headlight switch to power a [now non-existant] CB 
radio.

I'm guessing a better place to put the power [yellow, battery] wire 
will be into the fuse box directly - block #7, which Bentley says is 
&quot;Unassigned (accessory).&quot; sound about right?

In the mean time, what should i do with the wire going to this 
CB-Radio mounting plate? it makes me a little nervous knowing there's 
juice flowing to this thing through 30 year old [god, am i 30 
already?] wires for no good reason. Plus i'm not going to use it for 
anything, so should i just snip it and cap it off or leave well 
enough alone?

Also, there's a fat red wire coming out of the fusebox, but going to 
nothing. it's pretty burly looking compared to all the others. i 
didn't get the fuse number [it's in the middle], but i'll look for it 
next time i'm out under the dashboard. any idea what this could be 
for? it's long enough to reach the glove box, but everything on the 
dash has juice as far as i can tell. this i'll just remove because 
it's not doing anyone any good.
