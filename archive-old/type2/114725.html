Subject: Re: [T2] E-brake troubleshooting

Hi Sean,

With a late-Bay (72-79, &quot;narrow-5&quot; rim) you don't have to remove the 
axle nut to get the brake drums off.  There are two 12mm (??) nuts on 
the face of the drum and that's it.

I usually find the drum a lot easier to pull if you slacken off the 
brake adjuster wheels beforehand, as there may be a lip inside the drum 
that will resist removal. Repeated impacts from a large rubber mallet 
usually help, and may relieve frustration at the same time.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; The removal of these drums is a FAQ unto themselves.  Typically it
&gt; will require several methods of attitude adjustment (i.e. 4 foot
&gt; long cheater bars, 36 mm or 46 mm socket depending on year, ratchet
&gt; or special tools, large quantities of beer, friends with forearms
&gt; like Popeye the sailor man, etc.. etc..) in order to get the
&gt; retaining nut off.
