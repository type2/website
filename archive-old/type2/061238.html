 &gt;  Hey Y'all,
 &gt;  I have a 70 Bus that the trans went bad in and I 
     swapped the trans for an 091 from a later Bus. I 
     don't know what year the trans came out of and 
     I want to find out what the ratio is. Is there a way 
     I can find out by the # on the side? Anyone know 
     how to tell? &lt;&lt;

  &gt; If it is an 091 trans it has a 32 tooth ring and 7 
    tooth pinion which equals 4.57 to 1 for the final drive.  
    Gears 1-3 are approximately the same  as your old 
    tranny and 4th gear is .89 - your old one probably 
    had  .82 4th but I'm not positive of that. &lt;&lt;

While I agree that the 091s from '76-'79 did come with
the 4.57 ring and pinion ratio all of the 1st generation
091s that I have had apart (1976-1979)  have had a
.82 4th.  The 2nd generation (1980-1983) have a mix
of either .85 or .88 and all of the 3rd generations
(1984+) have been .85.  The Wasserboxers in Europe
came with a .82 4th but all of the Vans imported by
VW for the North American market had the .85.
I use the 1968-1972 002 .82 4ths in my 3.875 ring
and pinion conversions for the pre-'68 split window
Busses.  The Type I transaxles all came with a .89
4th until the advent of the single-side cover IRS 
unit which began in 1973.  Those transaxles came
with a fine pitch .93 4th.  

Hey, I could be wrong!  Wouldn't be the first time!
I'm just basing my statements on what I have seen,
not by documentation.  It could have been my luck
to only get the 091 gearboxes with a .82 4th while
everyone else gets something different.
