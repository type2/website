Subject: Re: [T2] Just put on a high quality Empi muffler (hahaha)

&gt; I used the Bus Depot stainless Steel muffler, reconfiguerd my 1978 exhaust
&gt; headers to the 72-74 style and 5-6 years later the muffler still looks
&gt; almost new.  my recomendation without reservation.  only thing the little
&gt; tail pipe piece was welded up wrong and came out at a strange angle,
&gt; mostly pointing up, cut and rewelded it and works fine
&gt;

Bob,
Glad you have had good luck with this muffler, I have not, I have had the
same problem twice after 1.5 years on the T1 and T4 stainless steel
mufflers.  The outside does stay rust free, but the inside rusts away and a
big piece of metal always breaks loose (When the exhaust is off and you move
from side to side, you can feel the metal shift)

For the money, I am going cheap, as I still end up replacing in the same
amount of time :(  Wish there was something better out there  :((
