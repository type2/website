&gt; It's probably wishful thinking, but do the 914 heat exchangers fit VW type

&gt; thumbed through Automotion's catalog so I know the SS Porsche exchangers can
&gt; go for big $$ new:
&gt; 
&gt; PORSCHE 914 EXHAUST MANIFOLD, heat exchangers, 1700-2000 engines, oval exh
&gt; ports, 2 sets, 1
&gt; stainless, 1 orig equipment steel, both exc cond, $100 each set. (860) 526-5509
&gt; 

Sure the 914 exchangers would bolt on the early T4 engines, though since
the 2.0 heads were different maybe not those, problem is the heater
routing, 914 pipes no where near bus pipes so no go.  IMHO buy a brand
new good quality set, and have em powder coated, best you can do.

&gt; Since I'm more of a pre-71 bus guy, I'm more curious if there are SS
&gt; exchangers for off a 956 maybe that might be coerced into fitting a 1600 VW
&gt; with stock heads/exhaust.  Has anyone dabbled in the black art of mixing
&gt; porsche parts with VW? ;).

I guess we'd mean 356 exchangers, of which there are none in SS as far
as I know plus might only fit 25/36 hp if at all, though even that
probably sketchy, heads were quite different on intake side on exhaust
I'm not sure.
