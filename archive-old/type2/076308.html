Subject: [T2] ** Valve adj. problem for 1.7 engine **


&gt;I have a friend that bought a Porsche 914 with a 1700 engine  and is trying
&gt;to adjust the valves (talk about a pain to get to).  He just emailed me
&gt;this, but im not sure what he is talking about.
&gt;
&gt;&quot;I am pretty sure I found TDC and piston 1 and 2 were no
&gt;problem.  When I got to 3 I had a problem.  When I back out the
&gt;adjusting
&gt;screw the piston/spring followed.  No way to slip a feeler gauge in as
&gt;the
&gt;space kept collapsing. So, I doing something wrong or is the engine
&gt;busted?  Any ideas?&quot;
&gt;
