&gt;  Which brings me onto hill starts! Using the handbrake for 
&gt; setting off is NOT cheating!!!! It's the correct way to do
&gt; it. You should never ride the clutch when stationary to
&gt; hold position and trying to do some fancy footwork to
&gt; avoid putting it on when setting off is just daft.

See?  Told ya guys.  My post always generates this kind of response. :-)
What people don't realize is that there is very little to no difference
between putting your foot on the brake and letting out the clutch until
rpm drops before you move your foot from the brake to the gas versus using
the ebrake.  You'll still engage the clutch ever so slightly before you
let go of the ebrake lever so it's really all relative to your preferred
choice of driving styles.  There really is no right and wrong here.
Either method can get you into trouble with burnt clutches if you aren't
fast enough.  I've driven my 1974 Super Beetle this way for over 30,000
miles and I still have a good clutch.  Matter of fact, I've never had to
adjust it since I put it in.  What does that tell ya about good clutching?
:-)  I've done a little heel and toe as well and that works great too.  
It does help to use the ebrake - btdt and do it often in my bus however,
how many VWs have your driven with a broken ebrake that you still had to
drive. (Like my SB.)

And you know what?  Ultimately, if you like replacing clutches - you can
drive however the heck you want. :-)
