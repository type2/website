Hope my message did not come across as a smarty-pants reply - I was only
trying for some humor (wonder if made anyone smile?)  My brother in-law
is a German and I work with many German Engineers.  They are very
precise.  Even when they have something wrong they had a very specific
way of determing their answer. In other words a variable wasn't accounted
for or something similar, but the answer wasn't based on a hunch or a
guess.

I'm sorry if anyone took this the wrong way - my penance is a Bratwurst
with only american mustard.

Al can you forward this to Eric? - post to the list if you wish

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;John:
&gt;Please understand that Erik is a self confessed GERMAN and maybe you
&gt;know how fussy they are about being precise. The T1, T2, are all types
&gt;of TYPE 2's as designated by the VW factory. A1, A2, are Rabbits and
&gt;Golfs, respectively, I think (I'm not into em).
&gt;Erik is one of the most knowledgeable people regarding T2's (68-79 
&gt;type
&gt;2') and very generous with that knowledge, so I'm inclined to humor 
&gt;him!
