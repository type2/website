Subject: streeeetched studs

Hi Volks,
Curiosity killed the cat.  Except in this case.  I thought about leaving
the stud nuts at 15 lbs and went to look again at the one that had
twisted in half.  When I put the two pieces together I noticed that the 
broken area was thinner then the rest of the threads.  Ah-hah, I said.
Thats why I'm not getting any higher torque values.  I was just stretch-
ing the studs!!  Sure enough,  I took out a few of the other studs and
they had stretched also.  (Note to self:  Don't buy Empi/Mr.Bug(?) 
cylinder studs again)  I replaced those with the ones from the single
port just to keep the tension between case halves somewhat even.

So curiosity saved the cat from a lot of major work if I had just been 
satisfied with the fifteen lbs.  I could just see some form of cata-
strophic failure after 3000 miles.

So,  tomorrow I'll call the VW dealer and see about VW studs.  No chro-
moly for me. I want 'some' elasticity.

Any problems with replacing them one by one?

I'm still amazed that the Empi studs didn't even allow a stock spec!!!!

BTW I had remeasured deck height and confirmed my average CR of 7.4.  
Also the average CR side to side is within 97% of each other.  I don't
know if this matters =)
