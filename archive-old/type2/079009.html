Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Cooler removal engine in?


&gt;   Just wondering if anyone has ever replaced oil cooler seals without
&gt; removing the engine? Can it be done? Am I wasting my time?

It would help if you listed the year and engine in your bus.
Bay window type2's [in the USA] from 68 to 71 were 1600 uprights, 72/73 were
1700 typeIV's, 74/75 were 1800 typeIV's, and 76 to 79 were 2.0L typeIV's. Plus
whatever cobbled together combination you can imagine.
