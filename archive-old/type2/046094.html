Subject: Re: [T2] Dual solex carbs

Oh, my....  a religious argument! :-)

Doktor Tim put new carbs on his '72, set them up properly and wrote:

&gt; Everything set up and adjusted and tuned per Bentley. A Type IV motor
&gt; cannot run better than this. Soooooo nice.

Then various options were discussed regarding FI :-)

Now, first and foremost, let me say that:

(a) I have never owned a bus with dual carbs.  Until I bought the '67, all
my buses have been FI models and I *like* L-jet!

(b) Set up correctly, I am confident that the stock system... single carb,
dual carb, or FI will work very well on the bus and engine block they were
designed for.

(c) Without vastly more experience than I have, I would tend to stay with
stock.  At lest if you are converting from one system to another, operate
in the largest blocks you can afford.

I did discuss with Nikki whether to convert her bus (Wendelin, '73) to FI.
This was in conjunction with her decision as to whether to go to a 2L
hydraulic valve engine (Wendelin is currently undergoing major surgery in
the engine bay).  If she had decided on a 2L block to replace here stock
1.7L, I suggested going to the '78 FI to go with it.  She has decided for
various reasons to stick with the 1.7L and the stock dual carbs, which I
agree with.

As I said above, I have never owned a dual-carb engined bus.  When I
bought my '73, it came without engine or trans and I installed the whole
powertrain from my '78 in it, including the FI.  It is a '73 body, but a
stock '78 FI settup under the rear deck lid.  The only modification is the
'80-83 Cal electronic ignition distributor... otherwise it is stock for
'78.

It is my belief that a set of dual carbs could be happily installed on a
2L block in a '73.  I know there are plenty of people on the list who have
done this.  *BUT* I would recommend that anyone contemplating this take
their bus to a dyno shop ASAP after you get it done to make sure the
jetting is correct.  I believe that the stock dual carbs would be a bit
small for the 2L engine, but if they are properly jetted, they would run
fine, you'd just lose some HP from too-small carb throats.  Of course, if
you went to the 2L and the 2L FI, then the gearing on the '73 trans would
be a tad off, so you would want to go to a later 091 trans, to take
advantage of all that extra (?3? HP :-) power! Then you would want the
later disc brakes up front, in case you needed the extra braking... or you
could just go looking for a '78 bus which would be a lot cheaper :-)

VW buses are not collections of parts... they are *systems*!  and when you
start to play with one part of it, you wind up playing with the whole of
it, or paying the price.  For a '72 bus, a properly tuned set of dual
carbs sounds like the best available fuel metering system to me, at least
without major playing around time.  Plus, there is the personal taste.  
Each of us has a personal favorite year. For some, the whole thought of a
T4 engine is an immense unneeded tangle of complexity and expense, for
others the 1600 is just not enough engine to be pushing that much weight
around. To each his or her own.
