Hi Mike,

Laugh all you want... our dollar has been heading UP lately.

Tripping to EveryBus last year George Washington's portrait cost me 
$1.63 in Northern Pesos.

At EveryBus this year it was $1.35.  This week it's down to $1.27

Bus Content: My trip to John Brown's Buses is getting cheaper every 
year.... 10 days and counting! Visit www.johnbrownsbuses_dot_com for more 
details. Get there in time for Breakfast on Saturday and enjoy a 
Canadian pancake breakfast.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
