Subject: Sliding Door Curtain, 71 Westy

Calling all Bus interior decorators,
I saw the question asked a few weeks back, however I didn't see any
replies.  I have received great help from Paul and beautiful how to
instructions for creating curtains.
How do you hang them or attach em to the sliding door?  I have all the
original rods and cables everywhere else.  Found some fantastic tie die
at the local Wal Mart.  
TIA
FEBIII
71 Happy Bus
