Subject: 73 Westy For Sale...again

Hello all!!!

 Well, my 73 Westy is back on the for sale list due to unforeseen
circumstances. So Here we go again.......

The Good: New paint Job
                    NO RUST!!!
                    AM/FM Cassette

                    New upper cot
                    Good seats

The So-So: Interior is functional but needs work
                     Pop top canvas is in good shape but the side screen
covers are safety pined,  zippers are broke

The bad:     No heat...has no billows
                     The battery needs replacing
                     Left outer tie rod needs replacing, I have new ones,

                     Pop Top end seal needs replacing, have a new one for it
