&gt; Then Steve Johnson remarked:

&gt;&gt; Wow Lee!  You actually 'bought' one of those?  Every one I've ever seen
&gt;&gt; is plugged somewhere between the exhaust and the EGR valve.

&gt; Well,  I thought I had to.

You know, I just went through all this to get my '78 Westy past CA smog. In CA 
they definitely check my year for egr function, since my egr was &quot;tricked up&quot; to
pass visual, but would not function. My egr filter box was basically intact,
but the upstream pipe was rusted through. I cleaned out the can real well with 
oven cleaner (the steel wool in there has long since gone away). A muffler
shop reattached the thing to the muffler for me. A lot of fussing
with the other components, and I PASSED :-)

Two years from now, I could well have to drop the bucks for a new filter as 
this one might rust through by then. I thought about disconnecting this system 
to protect it from all that nasty exhaust, but recent posts about how 
functioning egr producing cooler engine make me think I want to keep it
functioning. And then of course, there's the air we all must breathe..

My old mechanic scoffed at egr and disconnected mine. I asked him if it had any
valuable function and he said,&quot;What? Putting exhaust back into your engine? Ha!
(Dismissive laugh).&quot;

Anyway, I've seen a lot of disconnected egr's on buses too. I assume they are  
either on their last two years of life, or they know a dishonest smog technician
I haven't met yet, or they are cruising for an expensive last minute purchase 
and repair like Lee just endured.

Hey Lee, does your bus run cooler now? I haven't driven far enough to notice
yet with mine. Any power or mileage changes?

Drive safely,
Surfer Bob
