Subject: Jetta CV Boots

I know I'm off topic, but has anyone changed the cv
boots on an 85 manual vw jetta?  Alternately, does
anyone know where I can obtain a good description of
how to?  The Bentley description seems incorrect and
incomplete (remove bottom ball joint by removing 2
bolts, but there are 3 bolts, and why remove them?)
