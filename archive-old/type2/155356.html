&gt; &gt; If they're still using AVPs you might want to think about that. It's

&gt; &gt; Especially since I didn't buy the engines in question.

&gt; &lt;shrug&gt; I've got an AVP 2.0L in my '75 with 30,000 flawless miles on
&gt; it.
&gt; My only complaint is that the exhaust studs weren't straight, so
&gt; installing the heater boxes was a bear...


I just installed an AVP rebuild (via Bus Depot) last weekend and had
just this problem.  It's an easy one to fix. Thread a nut onto the stud.
Put a deep 13mm socket on your longest extension.  Put that on the nut
and &quot;coax&quot; the stud into the correct position.  The studs are relatively
soft and can be bent a fair amount without damage (like 3/4 of the studs
diameter in my case).  Work slowly, better to do it in 2-3 try than
overshoot in one.
