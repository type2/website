Subject: Shell Rotella/XLA

Evening, all-

What is the opinion on the list of the Shell Rotella 15W40 dino oil? It
would be for use in a daily driver 1974 T2, 1.8 ltr, with hydraulic lifters.
I live and drive in western KY where the winter temps rarely go as low as 0F
and usually average in the 30's to low 40's. In the summer we can have
daytime temps of 90+ for days or weeks at a time. Most of my driving is
short trips, ie, 10 miles to work, 5 miles to Wally World, 20 or 30 miles of
errands around town, with an occasional 50 mile trip to the big city.

Just looking for opinions, especially from those who have used this oil.

Thanks,
Dave
