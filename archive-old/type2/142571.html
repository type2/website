Hi John,

I have successfully installed a pair of carbs from a 1.8 onto a 2L  
block. No problems with fit. I upsized the jets with new mikuni jets  
from the local snowmobile performance shop.

Drove it like that for just short of a year, then converted to FI.   
The dual carbs were OK, but the FI is way better.


Happy trails,

&gt; I'm not sure that is the engine that is supposed to be in the 76  
&gt; (there never
&gt; was a &quot;single carb&quot; type IV) but if it is a type IV it should fit.  
&gt; The single
&gt; carb setup is an after market rig but your carbs should also fit.  
&gt; If it is a
&gt; 2L
&gt; engine the carb linkage might not reach accross.  The 2L is wider  
&gt; than the
&gt; 1700/1800 (I think).
