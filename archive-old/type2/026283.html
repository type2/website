In my search for the fuel-in-crankcase problem, I obtained a fuel pump
rebuild kit and went out to the bus in a purposeful way, tools in hand,
on Saturday afternoon.  Now according to Haynes, the fuel pump
(mechanical) on a pancake engine can be removed with the engine still
installed.  According to Muir, this is not possible.  Optimistically
believing the former, I got under there and had a look.  One of the two
screws holding the pump to the crankcase (of the type found on CV
joints) is completely obscured by the air cleaner pre-heat duct.  Might
be possible to remove said duct if starter were not in the way.  Has
anyone ever removed a fuel pump without taking the engine out?  I would
love to know how.
Anyway, I took the hoses off and separated the two halves of the pump (6
screws).  After wiping the small torrent of petrol from my arm, I
examined the diaphragm.  Looked like new, no signs of perishing or tears
etc.  So I figured it must be a carb problem after all, I was half
expecting that anyway, they are very worn and I was planning to get new
ones before long.  I put everything back together and changed the oil.
At least I have a spare rebuild kit.
Sunday morning the bus started fine, ran until the carb bowls emptied,
then nothing.  Surely I didn't hook up the hoses back to front?  We
needed to get to church so we got the bus into town (double decker as
opposed to VW).
After fortifying myself with lunch, I went back out, on my back, in the
snow, to fix the problem.  I had a picture in my mind of which way I had
connected the hoses.  The reality did not match the picture.  I don't
know how it happened.  Maybe the bus gremlins switched the hoses in the
night.  It was cold, maybe my brain froze.  Anyway, put the pump back
into the use for which it was intended, cranked the engine ... and Sally
once more stumbled into life.
