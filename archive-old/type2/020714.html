Subject: Camper for sale

     I sent this notice in last week just after the Earthquake. A couple
of people responded but I never saw a copy on the Type 2 list. Now that
things seem to have stabilized, here's the original ad plus answers to a
couple of questions I received.
     For sale, best offer; 1970 Type 2 camper van, non-poptop, all
original beds, cooler, water tank, sink, pump, folding table, accessory
stool, etc functioning. Front seat is walk-thru type. Body condition
good, never involved in an accident, always kept in a garage.175, 796.5
mi. total on odometer. Original color inside &amp; out was red. Repainted
exterior white with red stripe in 1979, added Moon Roof above driver &amp;
passenger seats in 1979. Original upholstery in reasonable condition.
Engine was &quot;Californicated&quot; to their standards in1975 &amp; restored in 1981
to Normal AZ standards. Engine overhauled in January, 1996 &amp; hardly
driven since. Needs new tires, spare tire
front-mounted, needs new cover. Replaced windshield in 1994 after
successfully catching a brick dropped off a bridge into passenger seat.
     Vehicle located in Sun City, AZ. VIN 2302243057. Leased vehicle
from early 1971 to Apr 1972 and then bought it from the dealer. One
owner since then. My image scanner is down so I can't show pictures
although it's picture has been in several astronomy books and magazines.
I have no asking price because it's been about 30 years since I
bought/sold a vehicle so I don't know what it's worth. Please reply via
e-mail to petemanly_at_qwest_dot_net.
