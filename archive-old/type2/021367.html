Subject: CV joint inner shields

List:
Recently, I was moving some old stuff and found some CV joints and axles
which I believe are the originals to my 69 double cab (stories about
hiding my own Easter eggs...I had noidea they were still around!)
Anyway these thing have inner shields that completely enclose the
exposed part of the CV. They just have shiny metal showing where you
ususally see the grease.
Anyone know waht these are for?
Thanks,
Al Brase
