&gt; I don't think this is necessarily a wise move.  When VW stopped using the
&gt; cylinder/head sealing ring they also started using a thicker cylinder/case
&gt; sealing ring to add back the deck height lost when the head sealing ring
is
&gt; removed.  Who the heck knows *what* GEX did in this case?  Unless I was to
&gt; tear the engine down far enough that I could check the cylinder/case rings
&gt; I'd leave the head sealing rings in place.  To simply remove them at this
&gt; point risks setting the engine up with a too-high compression ratio.

Replacing the heads without the sealing rings
will raise CR by about 1/4 point.
This is far better than the risk of having another
blown gasket, and is in keeping with the service
recommendation to remove them.
It will also provide a minor increase in horsepower.
The original post noted a measurement of 120 psi
across the new engine, and this is an indication
that the CR is very likely on the low side now.
It is also running a carb, so there would be less
interference than with FI, which is a little fussy.
A very few extra horses can't hurt this bus.
There was no mention of overheating in the diagnosis.

Since the head is already off, the engine is also
ready to check deck height, measure chamber
volumes, and compute CR, with appropriate shims
for making the proper adjustment.
There are many details involved with proper engine
assembly. GEX more than likely relies on the
tolerances provided by the manufacturers of the various
parts subassemblies and simply bolts their engines
together. The problems come from stacking up tolerances
to the point that their engines are in constant strain to
produce horsepower in an unbalanced condition, and
service life is reduced by the horsepower lost overcoming
deficiencies.
