Subject: RE: [T2] AVP ?

&gt; &gt;Anybody know if AVP is still in business? The link I have to 
&gt; their web page is down...
&gt; 
&gt; I bet Ron knows. Their phone number seems to go to an 
&gt; answering machine always even though it's business hours.



They''re alive and kicking. In fact I just spoke to Erin at AVP half an
hour ago about an engine they're building for a customer.  You can also
order their engines online from our website, www.busdepot_dot_com. (Search
keyword &quot;longblock&quot; if you don't find it via the drilldown menu.) All of
our rebuilt Bus engines and heads are AVP.

Their own website is http://www.avpworldwide_dot_com . It's working at the
moment.  As for reaching them by phone, they're a small family run
business and often put the machine on during business hours if they're
swamped. They're generally pretty good at getting back to people but
sometimes not until the end of the day.
