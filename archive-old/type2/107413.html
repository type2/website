Subject: RE: [T2] Help Idle Problems in TX...

I am replacing my Temp Sensor II this weekend.  I'm pulling one from
my other bus which ran great before it worked a rod loose.  I havn't
pulled that sensor yet though.  In order to remove that sensor, a
deep socket like what is used for pulling spark plugs seems to be in
order; however in the set that I have (metric) I do not have a
socket of the appropriate size.

What is the metric socket size required for the removal of Temp
Sensor II?  I need to purchase one and don't want to play musical
sockets at the auto-parts store.  When the music stops,.... grab
another socket :/

&gt; Cha (&amp; anyone else w/ carbs that are looking for your
&gt; temp sensor II).
&gt; It's a FI only item. It varies resistance depending on
&gt; how hot it is &amp;
&gt; is mounted in the 3/4 cyl head to measure heat. The AFM
&gt; takes the info
&gt; &amp; adjusts the mixture to suit the conditons.
