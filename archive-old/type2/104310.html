&gt; The doghouse oil-cooler is the same oil-cooler used in 68-70 buses, it's
 just the fanshroud that's differnt.  Post 70 (?) beetles also used
 doghouse shrouds, so they're readily available, although there are
 aparently some differences between the bus and beetle shroudings (the
 beetle shroud is apparently slightly smaller volume).  If you have the
 shroud, you can convert to the doghouse setup with a step stud.  Fairly
 straightforward and easy...

No, they are 2 totally different coolers.
70 and back, the oil cooler bolts to the top of the case.
71 the cooler bolts to the right angle adapter.
You cannot bolt the 70 and back oil cooler on a 71 adapter. No way - no how.
If you want to bolt the adapter to a 70 and back case, then you need a step stud. The adapter is a separate
piece from the cooler. Here are pics:

A is the 70 and back cooler.

E is the 71 only cooler.
G is the adapter.
