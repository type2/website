Subject: DM: Dead Dynosaures in the form of carbon. 
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.5.32.19991025084409.008218e0_at_rockisland_dot_com&gt;

My only personal experiance with excess dead dynosaure build up was with my
BMW R90/6. I bought it new in the spring of 77. I wanted das beste for my
third Deutches
Machinin. After the factory fill, I used strait 40w racing oil. By the time
I got to 20,000k, I started picking up a subtle ping under heavy throttle.
It was a 9.3:1 compression ratio with squish band pistons. It was during
the time of lead reduction and the first now lead gasolines and the less
high octane leaded fuel being, more or less, less available, thence
becomeing the least of all, NoLongerAvailable, i.e., unobtainium. 

I speculated that my pinging sympton was thus explained. I continued using
the BMW club experiment of adding about 25% of leaded then 30% low lead
with the highest octane no lead available. It did raise effective octane
from a piddlin' point to a level of meduim-low mediocrity or so the
INDEPENDANT LABRATORY DATA CONFIRMED the BMW club members experience. By
the time I reached 25k, something had to be done. Now, instead of not being
able to have full acceleration to stay out of the ping zone, I couldn't use
medium-high acceleration. That left middlin' performance.  Options: reduce
compression ratio or buy very spendy octane boosters or av-gas. The spendy
octane booster was the least cost. Next question: Which is beste? And who
are the beste someones to ask? 

At the drags the following weekend as I entered the facilities with the
intent of using MY eyes and MY ears acutely tuned for input relevant to
answer MY question to resolve MY problem, I headed for the pits. Not having
been to a drag race in many
years a little initial evesdropping and I was able to learn who the man to
beat that day was in the Top Gas catagory. Tiptoeing throught the drums of
av-gas to the identified current Master of Gas of high compression straight
line motoring, I was checking out the various snake oyls in the various
competators various crew areas to see what various products they liked to
keep right here handy.

I saw two five gallon cans of MOROSO Octane Boost by the time I had arrived
at the pits of the current best fitted to win point leader when I saw my
third aforesaid
MOROSO logoed bucket, in his pit. My subconscience starts to pokin' at me
pokin' at me pokin' at me with one word: paperpencil. I knew that. 

As the crew was obviously busy preping for the first run, I egressed back
along a the line adjacent to the ingress path on the other side of pit road
sponging more data with the eyeear tech focused to get my needed
instruments. Back the bike, I pulled out my Ross Langlitz custom tailored
goat skin jacket and extracted therefrom my K&amp;E lead holder, K&amp;E lead
pointer and 39 cent spiral bound note pad. As I sharpened the lead, the
intermediate questions I needed answers to in order to get to THE QUESTION
of the day fell into que in preparation for writing down for to ask the
Master of Gas. I noted: C/R, HP, Weight, rate of piston failure.

&gt;The carbon deposit buildup that one seems are more likely gummy tars from
&gt;longer molecules created in the combustion process.  That's why stuff like
&gt;Marvel Mystery oil is popular...it's a solvent that removes that crap (or at
&gt;least claims to).
