Subject: My Heat Exchangers Have Tailpipes?

Gang,

I just got a 1978 Westfailia, that I am going to call the Mold Moblie, cause
everything is moldy -- seats, camper top, inside head liner, door panels.
You really wouldn't understand unless you lived in Washington State.

Anyways, I was replacing the brakes with the tires off and noticed that my
heat exchangers on both sides have tailpipes, I have owned a dozen or so air
cooled VWs however have not had anything like this.  Basically, where the
heat exchanger &quot;knuckle&quot; (the bend for the flap that controls heat
direction) there is a tailpipe that comes out there and off each side.

Can someone tell me about them?  This is a 78, Westfailia, 2000 cc, EKG (out
of the factory), with hydrolic lifters.

-Wayne
