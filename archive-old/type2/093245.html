Subject: Re: [T2] '78 westy timing

I just want to throw in the observation that not ALL fans have this 
notch.  I have three spare fans in the attic and two of them do not have 
the notch!  I couldn't believe it either but I looked very closely at each 
one and lined them up next to one another to be sure.  Maybe the ones 
without the marks are aftermarket?

Also, this notch even if it exists can be very difficult to spot for a 
first-timer.  It is easily obscured by dirt, paint, or other crud that may 
have gotten in there over the last decade or two.

&gt;The numbers are not on the pulley, they are on a plastic strip that bolts
&gt;between the post at 7 o'clock and the post at 12 o'clock beside the
&gt;pulley.  The fan has a tiny notch on the forward rim that matches against
&gt;this scale.  If your scale is missing, www.busdepot_dot_com, www.busboys_dot_com
&gt;and VWoA all sell it for &lt; $10 USD
