Hi Volks,
Frustrated and anxious that I was not able to get the '66 going this
past weekend because of my little mishap, I decided to put in a new 6
volt battery and try out the electrics.  Much to my pleasure, absolutely
everything worked perfectly (I did not try the starter)  I was beaming
from ear to ear!  I hopped in the driver's seat and turned the original
Sapphire AM radio on.  I jammed to some country tunes and day dreamed
about the day I will be driving the bus.  What a motivating experience!
