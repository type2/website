Subject: FW: Deal on Boge shocks!

[...] Has anyone seen the article on Type 1 Air Suspension in the March
issue of HotVW's and Dunebuggies. Page 53. Essentially, it is an adaptation
of the air suspension used on 18 wheelers for the type 1 bug.
 
Apparently it is fully adjustable from inside the vehicle, wheel by wheel or
any combination and can increase or lower height up to 4&quot; on the bug. I have
been meaning to call the company to see if they have the same type of setup
for the type II, or if they plan on it.

This does not replace the shocks, rather it takes over for the job of the
torsion bars. They say the ride is MUCH smoother and more stable than a
regularly sprung VW.

 The two companies that sell this are:
 
Just Buggin
(530) 589.4332
 
Airlift Company
 (800) 248.0892 ext 240
