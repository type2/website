Subject: Sending Unit O-Ring needed?

Hello lists, I just got my 75 Riviera running and
driving, for the first time in atleast 9 years.

My problam now is I have a fuel leak coming from the
Sending unit o-ring. So where do I find one? What size
is it?

I always see posts about replaceing your fuel lines,
which I did, but I have never seen anyone say to
replace or check the O-Ring.

So if it has been said before then I missed that post,
but if it hasn't been said. I am now!

Check those fuel tank sending unit o-rings also when
you are checking and replacing the fuel lines. 

Thanks, and hope everyone is enjoying the long
weekend.
