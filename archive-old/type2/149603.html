Subject: New axles too long no more

Stuff happens, and this supplier fixed it, fast! Bus Depot has fixed the
problem with my too long axles, in lightning fashion! I'm Impressed! I
received a call from them Monday to discuss the problem. I was told the
correct axles would arrive Thursday and here they are. One more happy
customer. :~)

Now on to a new minor problem. This evening I inspected the hardware that came
off the axles and discovered that 4 of the spacers that go between the socket
head bolt heads and the protective cap of the boot are different from the
rest. the 4 problem spacers are crescent shaped like the picture in the
Bentley. The rest are kind of like a double z shape
  ___
_\   /_

The double z shaped spacers seem to fit better than the crescent shaped ones
due to the protrusions in the protective cap between the bolt holes.

Does anyone have any of these double z spacers they would be willing to part
with, sell, trade?

Or should I file out a notch in the crescent shaped spacers to clear the
protrusions in the protective cap? It appears the P.O. simply forced the
crescent shaped ones to fit by hammering down the protrusions, not a good
looking alternative in my book.
