Volks,

  I am in the process of putting the heat exchangers back on and I must say 
they are very stubborn and it almost appears I have a bent exhaust stud it is 
so difficult to get on. However I dont have a bent stud and my next option it 
seems like is hammer and punch to drivem on but I can see ruining my threads 
and I think that would be a huge mistake. Is there a trick to this?
 Also as this is my first bus and rebuild, here I am this far  along and I m 
not sure which side of the motor is left and right. they say put the left 
one(heat exchanger) on first, I assume the fan side is the front and the left 
fan side is the left front side of the motor, duh???

  Thankyou,

   David
