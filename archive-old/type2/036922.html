&gt; this fabrication would be very easy i think... at least on a single port
&gt;
&gt; take single port intake manifolds cut the center out to the point where
&gt; you have a horizontal tube just long enough to be fully horizontal.
&gt;
&gt; rotate or swap side to side so that the horizontal bit points out
instead
&gt; of in.
&gt;
&gt; Weld on your carb mounting plates.
&gt;
&gt; the linkage, hmm that might present a problem...

Unfortunately, mine is a dual port.  Now with a tubing bender I could make
a pair of manifolds with two tubes each for a total of four carburators.
that would be a challenge to tune!  :)
