Subject: RE: [T2] SVDA and Kadrons

Hey John- lighten up. I really appreciate all the help you have given the
list in the past and I can understand how personal grievances can linger. I
just want to maintain the public contribution of VW knowledge ( of which you
have a bunch)so that our vehicles can run forever. BTW, I do not have the
power to ban anyone and I would surly not ban you, you have been most
helpful to the list. Thanks again, Ted

Don't take life to seriously -- you'll never live throught it....
