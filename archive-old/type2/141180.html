Subject: Re: [T2] My Bus

&gt; Park you or the bus? (-8  On an Island, I'd think there'd be salt year
&gt; round!

That what I thought as well, but its not bad at all. In the winter they only
lightly salt the main roads only due to the fact the whole island is pretty
much farmland. For some strange reason there are a lot of old cars there
including VWs... splitties, ovals etc.
