Subject: Re: [T2] Oops [clunking in rear wheel of '70]

Hi Duncan,

I had the same &quot;clunking&quot; in the rear wheel of my '70 bus, twice.  The first
time it was caused by a missing clip on the emergency brake arm.  (I think
that was the case.  I was new to my bus then and didn't know diddly about the
rear wheels.  Now I know diddly but not much more.)  The second time, just
recently, I found a broken e-brake cable to be the problem.  Basically, if you
open up the rear wheel, I think you'll see some problem with the e-brake arm.
Good luck.

See you on the road,
Jerry
