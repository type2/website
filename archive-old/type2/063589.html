Subject: Seat question

I am tired of an aching back.  I want to put in some good seats (or at
least newer ones) in my '74.  I was thinking about Vanagon seats, since
they would probably be the best in fit, but is this workable?  Has anyone
done this before?  I want a seat that supports the back of my legs, since
the 20 year old one I am using now doesn't.   Every time I lift my foot to
hit the brake a feel like I'm going to slide out of the seat.

Thanks,
Craig
