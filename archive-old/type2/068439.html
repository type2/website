Subject: Is &quot;Lucas&quot; an American expression?

Is &quot;Lucas&quot; an American expression for something of a poor design?

Lets not forget the first Transporter prototypes were not made until 
after the Germans were given the VW factory back. If the horn is the 
same as on a Beetle then it was designed by Porsche and his German team.

It seems to me that because one list member had a LUCAS coil without an
external resistor (either he or the PO screwed up here not LUCAS) then
some other list members are posting things which they consdider to be of
a weak design to be LUCAS.

Should I start posting exhaust leaks by saying my exhauast is 
&quot;Challangered&quot; or if something else goes spectacularly wrong to say it 
has &quot;Space Shuttled&quot;? Of course not that would just give you offence.... 

I don't work for LUCAS but I have and do use LUCAS parts. I find that
when used and fitted correctly they are as reliable as anything else.
Even my horn which does work!

Bob
