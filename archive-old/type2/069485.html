Subject: Re: Over Heating! '81 Westy

Johnny Stutsman writes about pinging and overheating in his '81 Westy:

Johnny, I can't comment on the pinging, but I can tell you that cleaning
out the EGR valve, replacing the cannister and adjusting the linkage on my
California-equipped '81 Westy lowered my oil temperatures by a good 20
degrees across the board and gave me a bit more power to boot.  The
cannister was awfully expensive to replace (~$175), but if yours is in good
condition, then overhauling your valve might be part of the solution to
your problem.  I say &quot;in good condition&quot; because what lowers the
temperature is mixing exhaust gasses, not atmospheric air, into the
incoming charge.

Cleaning it is pretty straightforward if you can get it apart.  Mine had
about 100k miles on it and wasn't difficult at all.  Just don't forget that
there's supposed to be only a small hole (~ 1/16 inch) in the gasket on the
interface between the tube from the EGR cannister and the valve.

I'll leave comments on the pinging to others.
