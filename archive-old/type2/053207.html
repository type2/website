Subject: RE: Oil temp FART

The oil temp question should be in the FAQ!  
Last time around a lot of people were saying on the order of 250F.
You don't need a oil temp gauge, what you need is a fuel pressure gauge.
They say if you can hold the dipstick, then no problem. My dipstick is
always quite cool, its the back bumper I can't touch.
Its Friday in Canada because tomorrow is Jean Poutine day
in honor of our geriatric Prime Minister.
