Subject: Re: [T2] Heater Cables

Darren,

Let's see, you replaced the two rear cables, which should have left you 
with enough cable to use to replace those two parts....at least that's 
what I did.

Pull the internal actuating &quot;wire&quot; out and then just cut the outer
&quot;liner&quot; to the length you need.  Reinstall inner cable and cut with about
6&quot; too long.  Reinstall both.

If you need to recreate the &quot;special&quot; ends on the lever end(I saved mine) 
then you can heat the cable up and bend it the way you need to....don't 
forget to reheat and then &quot;harden&quot; it by quenching the red hot part in
oil or water.

I save all parts like that when they come off the bus....I probably have
about 8' of cable and wire left over for the next time.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hello All,
&gt; two heater cables. Not just right and left...the ones that go to the
&gt; heater boxes. I've already done those. I need to replace the other two.
&gt; Both are on the left red lever that says defrost.  One of these cables

&gt; whether heat goes to the rear of the bus.  I have yet to see anyone
&gt; advertise these two cables. Many years ago (10+) I went to the dealer to
&gt; get a replacement and they looked at me like I was from another
&gt; planet...&quot;There ain't no such part!&quot;  Anyone have any ideas on where to
&gt; get these cables?
