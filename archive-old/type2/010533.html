&gt; What does the list wisdom, and the fire extinguisher gurus think
&gt; about the 
&gt; toxic fumes / byproducts being generated by the halon extinguishers?
&gt; I hear they are becoming unpopular because of that fear.
&gt; Is it hype or a real concern?

The fumes that result from the interaction of halon and heat may be
dangerous if they are confined in a space where you have to breathe
them.  Of course, being burned up in a fire might not be too healthy
either.  Halon itself is not dangerous.  If you have a reasonable
amount of ventilation, you won't have any problems.

Halon is a great substance, but it is becoming more and more expensive
as the enviros have targeted it as a ozone reducer.  There isn't really
a good replacement and the airline industry is scrambling for the
remaining supplies.  Considering the tiny amount of Halon we would use
compared to the huge amount of freon we used to use, the ban on Halon
production is silly, but that's the way our government works.
