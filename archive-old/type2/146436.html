&gt;   It wasn't bad, until I got to the bleeding part. Am I doing

You have a Motive Power Bleeder or a Mityvac attached to the bleeding  
screw? I find the former fairly foolproof.

&gt; go to RR, bleed it  first, comes out nice &amp; bubble free, as I would  
&gt; expect, not having  messed with the rears. LR, same deal. RF, got a  
&gt; lot of air out, but  eventually bubble-free. Same on LF. Get in,  
&gt; pump brakes, all the way to  floor!!! No pressure! For cryin' out  
&gt; loud, how difficult can this be??

It sounds like you didn't have a good seal on the hose against the  
bleed screw and you were letting air in during the bleeding procedure.

&gt; How many bleeding screws on your calipers ?  Are you always using the

The bottom screw is useful for removing the particles (fluid  
contamination) for the caliper. The top one is useful for removing  
the air.

&gt; Brake reservoir is still full ? If it goes empty or close while you
&gt; (power) bleed the brakes, air can get in and all your efforts are
&gt; vain.

Good point.

&gt; I don't know how power bleeder works so can't help with that. Bleeding
&gt; the good old fashion way has two advantages
&gt; 2) you know exactly what is going on

Except they often press the pedal to the floor too often. Another  
solution is to install speed bleeders.

&gt;     Make sure your rear brake shoes are adjusted close to the  
&gt; drum.  Make sure your calipers have squeezed in all the way to the  
&gt; rotor, sometimes after you have expanded them for the new pads it  
&gt; takes several pumps to get them to meet the rotor.



Very important to stomp the pedal 5 times before you start bleeding.
