Subject: uber-friday post

Y'all,

The flimsy shreds of buscontent I'm going to tie this togther with involve
today's earlier thread about the levels of &quot;maintenance&quot; listmembers are
willing to apply to our buses.

The guy who sold me my first bus has evolved to early 80's subaru vehicles and
their unique folklore.

As I sit here, hoping it stops raining long enough tonight to bust another
panel's worth of spraypaint on my bus, I can't help but know that some of you
will appreciate the parallels of this man's saga with your own.

An excerpt:

&quot;First there was spray paint. Along came the Cherry Bomb. Next there was
bigger wheels and coil spring boosters. Then there was body modification:
bolted in street signs for structural integrity.&quot;

Good writing, bad engineering, great site, enjoy.

Billy
