Subject: jaime's 69 brake decision.....

well j, 
from what i have read of your posts in the past, you seem to want to do a
job COMPLETELY, top to bottom and done ONCE!!!  so with that in mind....

....splurge.  bus(t) out the credit card and put 70 bucks or so on it and do
the rear brakes first.  then pay it off then do the fronts.  this way you
will know you have it done right, and will only have to do it once.  

i remember when i was short on cash once and need brakes on my 59 kombi.  i
decided to scrape by.  one wheel cylinder was leaking in the rear.  shoes
were soaked.  i poured white gas on the shoes and lit them on fire to burn
off the brake fluid, which does work!!  replaced the wheel cylinder.  drove
it until my next paycheck. then i had to tear into that same wheel again. 
what a bummer...so i decided to do one wheel a month.  not the best way, but
at least each wheel was COMPLETELY done and i didnt have to keep taking each
side apart to piece it all together.

heck if its only $100 or so, you could probably borrow it from someone. 
just an idea.

zzz
(alls well that stops well!!)
