Subject: oil filters

Volks Folks,

As an employee in the quickie-oil change industry for years,(not anymore), I can honestly tell you all that I have seen many different kinds of filters used on a variety of automobiles.  For VWs, the _factory_ unit works quite well.  Especially on those pesky wasserpumpers, as they tend to over pressureize and balloon the filter.  This gave VWs a bad rep. in our
shop.  I believe that the cause of blow-offs is more due to an unhealthy
lubrication system (i.e. stuck pressure relief valves) than to a certain
brand of filter.  As for filtration quality, I have found that the factory unit, the Bosch, the Deutsch, and the Mann all have superior construction and filtering characteristics(they seem to trap more grit and sludge,
noticed upon disassembly of used filters).

Beware: this is just my opinion.  No scientific data here, only years of
firsthand experience with repeat customers. 

....As for the &quot;brand wars&quot; among oil users, I will not even begin to enter into this discussion.  I will only say that I once knew a man with an
'87 Honda... He changed his oil every 3,000 religiously with Citgo Oil
and a Fram  or Purolator filter amd drove the dadburn thing 700,000 mileswith normal maintenance (water pump, belts, plugs, etc.) This is a true story. I changed the oil mony of the times it was changed.

Agreement Accepted, Disagreement Expected.
