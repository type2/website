&gt;Has anyone received their orders from PLFVW recently, within the &gt;last

I finally got my order first week of November after about 4 months.

&gt;I placed an order with Dawn the beginning of September and have yet
&gt;to receive it.  The last I talked to her she stated that I would
&gt;definately have my order the week before Thanksgiving.  That was
&gt;four weeks ago and she doesn't answer phone calls or e-mail.  I just
&gt;want to know if she is filling other orders?

I think that this is not the best time to place an order from Dawn/ PLF.  
Based on my recent experience, I would say that Dawn has a tendency to be 
overly optimistic (by 4-8 weeks) on here estimated delivery dates.  Also, 
she only seems to respond to about 1 out of every 8 e-mails.

When she did respond to my e-mails, Dawn assured me that I would get my 
order, that there were lots of other people waiting on their orders too, and 
that I &quot;was not alone.&quot;  She gave me a list of reasons why she was behind, 
and they're probabaly all true.

But, after a couple of months and many e-mails with no response, I figured 
that the order just wasn't coming.  I thought 'got nothing to lose here', so 
I fired off a series of mean and nasty e-mails saying all sorts of mean and 
nasty things.  I demanded a refund several times and even hinted at 
cyber-retaliation.

I finally got my order, but I think she was probably just getting tired of 
reading my rantings.  She probably thought, &quot;geez, this a_at__at_hole is crazy, 
I'd better get him off my back...&quot;  I hate to be that way, but it can be an 
effective tactic if applied correctly.

Anyhow, I don't think Dawn wants to be a scam artist and I bet you will get 
your order.  It just might be February before it shows up.  Just don't 
forget to remind her of what you ordered, where you live, and how much you 
paid on a bi-weekly basis.

good luck,

Brian
