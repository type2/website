 &gt;Well, I found two wires not connected to anything. Hmmmm....maybe there's
 &gt;a connection between these and why my bus will only start briefly. Using
 &gt;an ohm meter, I was able to get 0 resistance between one wire and pin 9
&gt;of
&gt;the ECU plug...which maps to pin 9 of the intake air sensor. The other
 &gt;wire shows 0 resistance to pin 12 of the ECU. Problem is, I can't figure
 &gt;out where/how to hook these up.

&gt;&gt;Sounds like the infamous Altitude Switch circuit.  Does your bus or the
&gt;&gt;original donor have a toggle switch mounted on the top mounting bolt on the
&gt;&gt;ECU.  Do these two wires exit the harness in the same place as the # 1 wire
&gt;&gt;to the coil?  If so that's what it is.  If you don't have the switch to
&gt;&gt;connect it to, you can purchase a simple on off toggle at a hardware store.
&gt;&gt;You're at sea level right?  Closing the circuit should make your mixture
&gt;&gt;richer, thus compensating for the denser air and it will run better.  Have
&gt;&gt;you had problems with lean running? Blown engines, dropped valve seats,
&gt;&gt;etc?

&gt;I have had 5 harness's recently. 4 had the 2 wires coming out and going
&gt;nowhere. The 5th one had the wires wacked off flush with the harness,
&gt;appeared factory. Three were 77 Westies that I own.[all deluxes] The other 2
&gt;were extra harness's I had and sent to Steve Dolan [1 with and 1 without].


Karl:

That may explain Steven Dolans richness problem.  My bus came from the
factory with the toggle switch marked &quot;High /Low&quot;.  My problem last spring
with emmissions and richness was caused by me installing a replacement
switch and positioning it backwards to the &quot;high/low&quot; label. So when it
said &quot;high&quot; it was really set at low altitude thus much richer.  Took me a
month of tearing through the entire system and reading every manual I could
find to find it was a simple &quot;on/off&quot; switch put in backwards to the label.


I'm actually wrong in what I said above.  The open circuit is the richer.
The closed or switched puts another resistor on line and thus less current
and leaner (for altitude over 4000 ft)  Haven't figured out where this
resistor is located yet.  Can't find any documentation on it.  Am wondering
if it is the one soldiered between the 36 and 6 terminal in the 018 AFM,
but that doesn't make any sense.

I am planning to use this circuit to boost power for hills and such.  I
have recently installed a fresh engine in my bus and have installed a O2
sensor for adjustment purposes.  I've set the AFM tension spring wheel to a
little richer than stoich (I don't want any burned valves).  I am going to
run a parrallel circuit to the dash and install a switch to pull for power
when I need it.

Any thoughts on this subject?  Did the two  spare wires in your harnesses
leave the harness at the same place as the # 1 wire to the coil?

Have fun
