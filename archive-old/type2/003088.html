75-80 on a flat highway with no wind.
90 on a flat highway with wind behind you
55 on a flat highway with wind against you
45-50 on a steep hill with no wind
60 on a gradual incline...like Denver to Leadville

&gt; Ok, so I'm a relative newbie to buses.  I've had my '76 Westy for a year
now
&gt; and put about 12,000 miles on it (10,000 on a fresh AVP engine).  With
wife
&gt; &amp; child &amp; small amount of supplies, I can cruise at 70-75 on the flats.
As
&gt; soon as I hit any hills, I'm struggling to stay at 50, and when it's hot
&gt; outside (80F+), I can't get much over 40 without seeing oil temps climb
over
&gt; 235.  My question is this:  with a good 2L FI engine, what kind of speeds
&gt; should I expect to be able to do up the hills?  Having no experience with
&gt; these beasts, I don't know if mine is performing poorly and needs to be
&gt; fixed, or this is what I should be expecting.  Please, oh mighty list,
tell
&gt; me - do I need a bigger engine to satisfy the hill gods or is there
&gt; something wrong with the one I have?
