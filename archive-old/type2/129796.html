&gt;Hi Marya,
&gt;
&gt;If you want a three point belts in the back seat of a 1970 Riviera you're 
&gt;probably going to have to mount *something* to a cabinet, or modify the 
&gt;cabinetry somehow. I am no expert on early bay's buses or Rivieras but 
&gt;IIRC the factory didn't start putting mounting brackets in for a shoulder 
&gt;belt until well into the 70's.

My '69  Bus (built Sept 68) has no seat-belts in the rear, but it DOES 
(DID) have a total of 16 mounting points in the rear and 8 in the front. 
According to the &quot;french&quot; (It a Swiss market model) user manual the 
seat-belts were available as an option at any VW dealer.... By the way I 
have a 9 passenger model and the spare tire is under the front seat.
Lots of cargo space both in the rear and in the front.  :-)
Cheers,


Rogelio
