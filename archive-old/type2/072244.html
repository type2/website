Subject: Re: [T2] ignition lock removal

[...]
hi bob - hey i picked it out. it was like this: take a big paper clip and
send it into the hole at the top of the ignition case. the ignition case
holds the lock and ignition wiring. the hole is seen if you are looking at
the ignition mount facing the rear bumber. press the paperclip deep and
hold while the lock slips out. make sense?  - steve
