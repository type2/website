Subject: Re: [T2] Cops and Busses

Bryan, let me guess, you were old enough to experience the mid 60's to mid
70's. If not you are a leg up on most your age.
Remember these are Law Enforcement persons not Peace Enforcement. Part of
their job is to create revenue and we are looked at as probable donators.
Hell we have a bus load of cash ;^)

&gt; Hello all,
&gt;  I thought I would chime in on this issue. Of course I am gonna be the one
&gt; to go against the grain and say that the best thing to do is cooperate
&gt; completely with the cops in the South East.  I grew up in the Carolinas
both
&gt; in the City and the way out Rednecksville.  I have long hair and drive a
&gt; bus, I am not a hippy but have been accused of such and really don't care,
&gt; nor am I a good ol boy. If you give the cops a reason to get pissed off at
&gt; you they WILL and CAN do unfortunate things regardless of its legality. I
&gt; knew cops that plant drugs on people so they can make a quota, or just for
&gt; the hell of it.  &quot;You don't have any drugs??? then what's this??&quot;  I'm not
&gt; trying to be a prick but you folks from the city or the north or where
ever
&gt; else need to wake up to the fact that allot of southern cops don't care
&gt; about your rights, Who is the judge gonna believe ? some outsider in a VW
&gt; bus or his brother in law who is the cop who arrested you?    I have been
&gt; pulled over many times and never been more 20 minutes, I answer every
&gt; question with YES SIR ,NO SIR.  20 minutes may seem like a long time but
it
&gt; beats a night in jail and a court date.
&gt;
&gt; Later --Bryan
