Combusty: (still rhyming after all these years)

&gt; Specific piece in Question:
&gt; Piece(s) on drivers side wall, below the windows and behind the
&gt; bench divider and back to the D.S. wheel well.
&gt; Questions:
&gt; 1. Is the wood paneling one piece or two?

Before you heat up enough to combust from friction or from
something else...oops, wrong thread...the location you describe
is TWO, TWO, TWO pieces in one.  At least it is in my '67.

&gt; The only thing I can imagine is that the Westfalia (the sadists)

This is inappropriate here, you want WESTY.SADIST_at_OLD.KRAUT.COM
I think.

&gt; Don't tell anyone (esp the vintage nazis) but I think VanBondo is
&gt; going to punt on this one and gracefully install (gasp) two
&gt; - -ellis\
&gt; ah... life seems simpler now...

The front piece (FIF) is 48&quot; wide from behind the partition to a
butt joint at the rear (approximately the same as the cargo door
side (LHD).  So, the sadists at Westfalia probably did what you
propose...mirror image the cargo door side on the driver side.
No chemical application required.  The seam is not hidden.

For this I walked in my robe to the barn for a flashlight and to
the basement for a tape measure and to a shed to crawl over stuff
to check the plywood on the driver's side?  Hey, at least it's
not raining or 110 degrees.  See, even gurus get grass on their
bare feet sometime.

Life IS simpler now, it's living that gets tougher each day.
