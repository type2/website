Subject: Non-VW - Solbourne Computer

I'm de-commissioning a Solbourne computer very soon, and there
was someone on the list who wanted it, but I forgot who.

Before all the rest of you jump in and yell &quot;me too!&quot; please
bear in mind that this is a dinosaur of a machine: a VME bus 
gem replete with SMD drives.  No, you can't run Win95 on it,
or DOS.  Its a Sun clone.

Contact me at thom_at_alldata_dot_com about this beast.
