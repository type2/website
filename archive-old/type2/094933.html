Subject: Re: [T2] question: replacing rear brake shoes



&gt;bar.  This was the biggest pain for rear brakes.  Boy was I glad when those
&gt;finally came out.  Be careful to not break off the clips that keep the 
&gt;stars
&gt;from inadvertently turning.


This is a little &quot;off-topic&quot;, but could be necessary as a last resort while 
exploring your rear brakes.  Is there stilla source for 'new' backing plates 
for, say, pre 1971 backing plates?  Thanks all.
