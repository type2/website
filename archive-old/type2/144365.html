&gt;  I have new Brazilian VW brand(VW Audi symbol on the casting) single port

&gt; new heads to work in, with initial stretch, or are the crappy South American
&gt; valves slowly failing?
&gt; I think I read some advice somewhere to take new heads and get new, high
&gt; quality valves put in em. Any advice here?

My Mexican heads closed up a bit in the first 2000 miles and then have
been remarkably stable ever since.  I check at 2000 mile intervals and
seldom have to change more than one of the valve setting on both heads!

My advice is to give the heads a few thousand miles to settle in before
worrying about them.
