&gt; i couldn't use your link for that jack but what i use is an ATV jack from
&gt; harbor freight with a board on top, drops down to about 3 inches and works
&gt; quicker and safer than anything else i've ever used to pull an engine.

What about a transmission jack?  They lift high, lower low, and have
rollers.
