Subject: Re: [T2] WANTED: 71 Westy (with certain features)

Michael said:


 Looking for a good solid (least rust-thru as possible) 71 Westy... WITH...
 NON-WALKTHRU front ! Sorry clan but I like the spare tire stash, and the
 ability for my honey to sit next to me.

 It can be motor-less, and trans-less, and rough/stripped, as I plan on
 stripping it, and doing a total rebuild. Could also be sans interior... but
 need the fiberglass top (or at least the hole in the roof, and I'll purchase
 a top.

 PS: The reason I want the 71 is the indicator lenses front and back, small
 5-lug pattern, and power brakes. I am willing to accept a 68-70, if it has
 the NON-WALKTHRU front (and I'll add the other stuff on in time).

Then you want the SO-69/1 or /3 model Westy. It has all the Westy pieces along the bulkhead. Solid glass
drivers side middle window, tall wardrobe behind the
driver, sink unit, stove unit, and cooler in line.

Great design but it was never a USA model. Any that came in the US were brought in by individuals.
