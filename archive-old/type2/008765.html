Basically its completely impractical because under the sheet metal housing is a finned
casting, which looks like it needs replacing. I too have that problem! (but am building
my own exhaust system)

This afternoon I pulled the exhaust system and heat exchangers.  There is a
leak inside one of the exchangers.  How practical is it to pry open the
exchanger, patch the hole, and close it back up?
