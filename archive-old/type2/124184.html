Subject: 2nd gear....

I high-tailed it to Hatteras about mid-week last week, and the ol' girl did
well. Despite the high ga$ prices ($2.19 hi test on Hatteras Island), I was
comforted with the 23 mpg she was getting on the road.
Darndest thing though --- after driving for a couple of hours, I found it very
difficult to get in 2nd gear. Second gear consistently, too. First gear was
only a bit easier. Third and fourth were normal.
While my Bentley manual is on back order for the fifth week, can the
collective wisdom help out? Is this a symptom of low tranny fluid? I had
horrible images of gears getting hot and swollen in the bowels of the tranny
--- yecch!
