Subject: Re: Safety 

for what it's worth, i got my insurance premium bill last week. i got a
$17 discount for the-bus-is-safer-than-they-thought (can't recall the
isurance phraseology for it). that is, they reduced my premium because of
the safety of the vanagon.

The above may reflect the overall costs, not the crashworthyness.
IE: due to the nature of the people that drive vanagons, they may get in less
crashes than Dodge Vipers, so cost less to insure.
It could also mean really bad news. Dead people don't sue much:-(
