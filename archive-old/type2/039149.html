Subject: Re: Gears not engaging- help!

It is normal to be able to shift into gears with &amp; without the clutch
engaged. It is also normal to be able to stop *one* wheel from turning when
the bus is running with the wheels off the ground, but not both at once.
Stop both and you should stall the engine. Does this happen?

&gt;Hi, I have a '69 bus with a '71 engine.  The engine &amp; clutch are brand new,
&gt;along with release bearing, and clutch operating shaft.  I can shift into
&gt;gears with the clutch engaged or disengaged.  When in gear the rear wheels
&gt;do not lock like they're suppose to.  Also, when bus is running in gear &amp;
&gt;rear wheels are off the ground you can stop the rear wheels from turning
&gt;with your hands.  I can't figure out what's wrong. : (
&gt;
&gt;Any help will be greatly appreciated.
&gt;thanks,
