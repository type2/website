Hi,

&gt; Since to date there exist &quot;No Harm No Foul&quot; with no accidents, injuries
&gt; or supplimental maintenance I feel that they have been fair and equitable

 Seems reasonable to me- as it happened there was no harm caused and you
have effectively had free tyres. Could have been much worse for all
concerned.

 It does sound (as Sean says) as though these will be Agilis 61s. If so
then they should be ideal. It'll be interesting to see what they charge
for these in the US.
 One poster to another forum indicated that he would never buy US made
tyres, as he doesn't trust their &quot;outdated&quot; plant. Seems a bit strong
but you're obviously avoiding that issue anyway!

Cheers,
	 W.
