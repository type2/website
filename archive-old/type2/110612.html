Subject: 1981 Westy a few questions

Hi All,I have a few questions.All the pics for the following question can be fould here:http://sky.prohosting_dot_com/~74thing/oilpump/oilpump.html1. Oil PumpThe oil pump I pulled from my engine is not the type 4 oil pump pictured in any of my books.
Can anyone tell me what pump it is?
To me it looks like a type 1 oil pump.
Will a type 1 pump work OK in the type 4 engine?
There are no VW markings, the only markings I can make out are on the cover &amp; there are:
8MM
USA2. Warm Air Blower VW # 070-256-051The Plastic housing the surrounds the warm air blower fan attached to the Alternator has melted on the bottom and lets air out.
Does anyone know it it can be repaired some how or should I find one in good condition &amp; replace it?3. Left Rear Engine TinOne of the previous owners removed tha AC my westy had &amp; when they did they put this in for the Left rear tin.
It is made of fiberglass and does not fit very well and is badly cracked in a few places.
I want to replace it with an original piece. If anyone haas one or knows where I can get one please let me know.
