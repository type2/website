To quote the producer of Car Talk, Doug Berman:

&quot;A car is just a big inanimate object through which we reveal ourselves and
our true personalities. Tangled up with cars are the issues of money,
power, independence, self-image, confidence, generosity and honesty, just
to name a few.&quot; 

Doktors Porsche made the car frugal with money, sufficient in power for
stated purpose, with independant ideas, no ego in it, with confidence in
results, and generous with honest reliability. 

The're the most human cars an ape could ever own.
