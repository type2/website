&gt; PMJI, From personal experience, (I just got a pickup to complement

&gt; Running 73MPH on highways with dino, I got 19 MPG.  After I changed
&gt; to Mobile 1, I got 21 MPG.  When I had the engine in my 78 VW van

unfortunately I did not do a fuel milage test. wish I had but didn't

&gt; rebuilt, the rebuilder SPECIFICLY said dino juice for 3,000 miles
&gt; THEN synthetic would be good, but NOT until 3,000 miles.

exactly the same I was told, in fact that was the reason I was able to do
the test, I was just finishing a break in on a new engine
