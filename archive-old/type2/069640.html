Saw a Sacramento, CA advertisement for a '65 2 window Bus w/ picture
By two window I mean there are only 2 windows left, the front.
Everything else has been cut away.  Poor thing, topless.
They still want $1950 or BO.   916-753-7485
Usual disclaimers apply, apply shock at the slicing and 
dicing of a bus at owner, not messenger.
