Subject: Term questions

I think I may know the answers to some of these, but can someone please 
clarify for me what the differences are between a Kombi, Deluxe, Microbus and 
Samba, including what years each where produced. Seems I see the terms Kombi 
and Microbus used a lot, even times when I don't think they are considered 
kombis or microbuses. Aren't microbuses early buses? Seems people use that 
phrase even for late, late bays. 

Confused,
