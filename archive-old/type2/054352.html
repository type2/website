Subject: fuel pump (Alt. style) question


&gt; hi, I have a 71 westy that is going to trade her 38amp generator for a
&gt; nice 55 amp alternator.
I assume you have a stock 34 pic 3 carbuerator.  you may need to grind down
the side of the alternator a bit for the accellerator pump connecting rod to
clear the alternator body.........
 I just picked up a new bocar fuel pump that is
&gt; the slanted type for use with the alternator.  The pump has two
&gt; openings--one for intake and one for output.  One is on top and one is
&gt; on the bottom.  Can anyone tell me which one is for intake and whic is
&gt; for output--top or bottom?  [...]
top is intake, bottom is output
 Also the box for the fuel pump says that
&gt; the pump can only be used with a 99.5 long driving push rod.  Does my
&gt; 1600dp have this push rod?
No, you need the shorter push rod.  If you use the longer one you will ruin
the fuel pump.AMHIK........
 There is a spacer looking thing on my
&gt; existing fuel pump.  Do i need this for my new fuel pump?

 Yes, it's the flange that the push rod goes through. you also need two
gaskets, at the top, and, bottom, of it.

&gt; responses will be greatly appreciated.  thank you
&gt;
