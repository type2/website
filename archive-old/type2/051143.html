Subject: [T2] idle lopes; hard to start

My '71 has a 1776 with dual Kadrons.

On Saturday, the bus ran well as usual. On Sunday, a new misbehavior appeared.

Unless I held my foot at the floor, the engine would crank but wouldn't
start.  Thereafter, at each traffic light,  the idle would change from
just-below-the-set point to maybe 200 rpm above set point with a period of
about thirty seconds.  It would repeat this for the duration of the stop.

The pedal on the floor symptom is  associated with flooding, and sure
enough the smell of gas appears just after the engine catches. The loping
idle is mystery to me.

These two symptoms must have a common cause. Can anyone help me diagnose it?

Thanks, Jack
