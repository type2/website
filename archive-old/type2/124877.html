Subject: RE: [T2] Metal Fuel Hose

FIX THAT RIGHT AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Use brake line if you have to.
Or I am sure someone has spare metal line to send you.
Then wrap some fuel hose (slit) around it to shield the metal through
the tin hole.
You are risking a bus fire in the most usual way!

...

I noticed my engine does not have a metal tube that passes through the 
front engine tin.  The fuel line just passes through the tin.  

What solutions are available to build/aquire the tube that goes throught

the tine.

Thanks
Steve
