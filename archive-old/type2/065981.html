        Hey, I use to cringe as well when I first say the breadloafs
in Mexico and central america...but they do have radiators [the newer
ones...post 84/85 I believe] and a waterboxer.  Even on the older
ones, you could apparently get an external oil cooler as an
option...though I don't think I would want to be pumping oil that far.

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!
