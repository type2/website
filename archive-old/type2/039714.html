Subject: Opinions on Engine builders

Just bought a 79 camper conversion. It's great, the body is in mint
condition and the interior is even better. The camping equipment was
never used, it was sitting in the 2nd owner's garage. It has supposedly
thrown a rod (spun a bearing?) I have not started it - just towed it to
my house. I have been doing some research on engine builders here in
northern calif. and beyond - Any suggestions? Any one build a 2000cc
with performance in mind? i.e. stroker crank, oversized P&amp;C, light
weight flywheel ......
