Subject: [T2] Distributor choice question

To answer a previous question, I painted my tin to guard against
corrosion.  I did paint it black in order to gain any heat transfer
benefits,  although I personally don't think color is all that
important. :)

Now for my question:  How much of a difference can putting a 
bug dizzy in a bus make?  While looking at the dizzy web page
and noticed that my dizzy is listed for a 1971 bug w/ MT.
Would I be better off with one of the distributors listed for
the 1971 bus?
