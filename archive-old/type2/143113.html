Subject: Re: [T2] Heater... too much of a good thing!

&gt; Wish I would have
&gt; known about this list years ago... could have saved a fortune in repair
&gt; bills! I have all kinds of tools, but suffer from a lack of self
&gt; confidence.
&gt;


What area do you live in? Maybe another list member can help get you started
on things you're not comfortable doing alone? Or just to give you moral
support while you tackle the job? I know I never would have tried working on
cars myself (also raised by a single mom) if I hadn't had others to help...
