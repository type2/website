As I remember, there was a thread about 6 months ago about the best colours
for buses. I've tried the archives, but no joy.

Considering that I have a factory high-top, should I go for 1 colour
including the high-top, just the bus or white above the bulge? Since last
year above the bulge is brilliant white &amp; the top is natural fiber glass
dirty white (very). This year I have loads of welding to do on the bottom.

I know that Black doesn't work &amp; my panels are not good enough for metallic,
I don't want an all white bus, what colours do you recommend?
