Subject: Re: Fuel Injection compatibility

&gt;I think if you use all of the &quot;otherwise 
&gt;incompatible&quot; 1978 FI 

&gt;components together, you should be fine.  The 75 FI 
&gt;(1.8L) is basically 

&gt;identical to the early 76 FI (2.0L), so there should 
&gt;be no problems 

&gt;caused by the difference in displacement (that's one
&gt;of the nice things 

&gt;about the L-Jetronic).


ok.  i'm now realizing i didn't word my question as
carefully as i should have, but i think you've
answered it anyways.

someone might be selling me a nearly complete FI
system from a 1978.  so i would be using all 1978 FI
in a 1975 engine, which, based on what people are
telling me, should be workable.

thanks to everyone who responded and everyone who gave
me links.

cheers,
will
