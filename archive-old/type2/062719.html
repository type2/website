Ok 
Thanks to all who corrected my GRAMMAR!! ;)
Well today was interesting. I scored some great tires for my
van, kinda an aggresive offroady tread with tons of tread left,
for $15 each. Not that I plan on doing lots of 4 wheelin but
hey, it snows a little here in Kansas...I also got a sliding
window out of a '79. Had to fork out $40 for it (ouch!!) but hopefully
the increased ventilation will be worth it. 

At the same place I ran into my first running splittie. I had seen
them in the junk yards but never running. At first I was excited.
I pulled up and read the pluthera of stickers on it. Obvious retro-
hippies dead head kinda folk. So anyway I get out of my car and notice
the plates are from Califonia, and here I am in Missouri.( Yes I live
in KS but it right next to the border.) Cool. So I survey the scene
and observe 3 youngish (20's) girls kicking back in the van while their
driver, and the van's owner, was in trying to get a tie rod end.
I  think to myself, WOW I will get to talk face to face with another
bus lover like the ones on the list. WRONG!! The guy, who had some
really weak sideburns and a poorly permed afro, was not to interested
in talking to me. He cated really put off that HE, being a Californian
had to even stop in the middle of the midwest. Well I was crushed.
I really wanted to go and look his splittie over real close just to 
see what it was but not with him. 

Have any of you seen &quot;Homeward Bound&quot;? Well I felt like Chance
(the pitbull) when he tried to get to know the porcupine and
got a snout full of quills.....anyway, he had to spend lots of time
waiting because the only tierod they had that would work was still
on a bus that had sunk into the ground...

He claimed his bus could go 120 MPH empty. When I questioned this
he said he had a high compression 1600cc and a Super Beetle tranny.
It still sounds a little exxagerated to me. but oh well

The girls eventually came in to the A/C building from the 
sweltering heat of the van. None were terribly pretty, and
none were really ugly either. they were from England, Whales,
and Austrailia. They were nice enough. They did not understand
why the nice older lady behind the counter kept trying to make small
talk with them. That is just kinda how we are out here. So 

So anyway I left with my tires and window, and they were still there
waiting on the tie rod end to appear............
