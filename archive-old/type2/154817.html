Subject: Sink Pump

I started to add this to my second battery and accessory post but decided it may need its own identity.

I think my sink works with the key off sometimes and other times I have to turn the key to the run position to get the sink to work, am I crazy, is this really happening?

How is it supposed to work?  It seems that having the key off would be the best way.

Is it broken, suggestions on fixing it?

1978 Westy,

Thank you,

James in Portland, Oregon
