&gt; Sorry for the urgency of this, but I'm trying to do it before it gets dark

&gt; I'm trying to test a 78 FI engine out of the bus and have a couple
&gt; questions.

I have a 78 but as always your mileage may vary
&gt;
&gt; What do I do where the brake booster hose enters the intake air distr on the
&gt; drivers side?

just plug it
&gt;
&gt; On the passenger side in the rear of the van, next to the engine hatch there
&gt; is a black cylinder with some hoses coming off of it.  One hose goes from
&gt; the top of it to the top of the air cleaner.  One goes from the bottom to
&gt; the passenger side of the fan housing.  What do I do about these? (There is
&gt; also some skinnier hose that goes up to the metal hose that runs across the
&gt; top of the engine compartment near the hatch and up the sides into the air
&gt; scooops)

these can be plugged too.  they are part of the EGR

&gt; On the drivers side in the front of the engine there are 2 big white plugs
&gt; with a bunch of wires that plug into  other big white plugs that are mounted
&gt; to the front of the engine compartment on the drivers side. Do I just leave
&gt; these unplugged?

these are critical, no relays no start.

&gt;
&gt; Do I need to use a fuel pump? Do I need to have a return fuel hose set up to
&gt; the gas can also?

yes, and make sure it is a FI pump they have much higher presures
&gt;
&gt; Will I need the FI control unit? If so how do I remove it?

yes, gotta have that to get engine running, it is removed by taking the
two bolts out of the top and bottom and sliding it out of the recess in
the wheel well.  make sure it is grounded.

hmmmm can't think of anything off the top of my head but I'm sure there is
something

good luck

Bob
