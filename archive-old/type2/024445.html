Subject: AM Engine Code

Does anyone know what year the AM engine code is? Bentley didn't show it
neither did Muir. I want to make sure I have the timing right. Now it
is timed at 0 TDC. Single port, 1600 (I think). Runs good, good idle, no
ping, no run-on, just backfire at deceleration. Gone through the exhaust
leak thing, enriched the mixture, cleaned carb completely checked for vacuum
leaks, still backfire on downshift. Help.
