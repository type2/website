Subject: Re: [T2] Fwd: Free 1975 VW Camper Van (California)

Last year I was trying to help Monique sell this and had pictures
posted on the local club board, but they are down now. As I recall it
was a nice looker, but victim of engine fire. She pulled the engine
for use in another vehicle. Red and white IIRC. Yes, Guerneville is on
the Russian River. Start point for shastasnowtrip_dot_com last year. This
year they are starting at Christopher Moore's in Willets.

&gt; Google tells me that the 707 area code is Northern California. I don't
 know anything about this vehicle, I just forwarded the post from the
 Vanagon List.
