Subject: RE: [T2] Oil breather hose

Richard, I hope someone answers this as I had a hard time my self when
replacing it.  I was forced to go with the closest size I could find
(too large) and clamp it.  Pic is here...

Good luck.

Subject: [T2] Oil breather hose

Does anyone know the i.d. in mm of the hose that runs from the air
intake
elbow to the oil breather?  I'd take it off to measure but the hoses are
so
old I don't want to disturb to ones I haven't found hose for yet.
