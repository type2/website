&gt;Hi guys,
&gt;Has anyone installed a fuel pressure guage in a FI bus.
&gt;I was looking at capillary tube type(non electrical) oil pressure guages the
&gt;other day wondering if one of them could be used.Being able to view fuel
&gt;pressure from the drivers seat seems like a good idea.

If you use a mechanical fuel pressure gauge, be sure to use one with an
isolator so that fuel does not enter the passenger compartment.  It is a
major safety hazard and might even be illegal.  In the racing world, it is
not done.  There are gauges that have an isolator outside the passenger
compartment which &quot;switches&quot; the pressure from gas to a more inert fluid
which could be used, but they are a PITA to get working properly.  My
advice would be to go electric.
