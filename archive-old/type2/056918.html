Subject: '81 Vanagon Westy ECU problems

Dear Sir,
I am the sometimes proud owner of an '81 Vanagon Westy. I live in the
Philippines where good VW parts and mechanics are facing extinction. 
Over the past 2 years, I have had problems with my van conking out (no
ignition, no click when turning the key, but still plenty of juice in the
battery).
This was finally solved on 2 separate occasions by replacing my ECU with a
working but used unit. I am now on my 3rd (borrowed)ECU and have just
experienced another disturbing, temporary conk out.
On the previous 2 occasions, the engine went through a series of temporary
conks over 2 weeks (it would stop and refuse to start for an hour or more ,
then miraculously start and run perfectly) until it finally refused to
start even after 2 days wait. Both times, I replaced the ECU and everything
was fine till many months later.   
I now wonder if replacing my stock 65amp alternator with a US-rebuilt 95amp
(both Bosch) has anything to do with my problem.
I would deeply appreciate your forwarding this to the proper forum or
posting my inquiry in your &quot;HELP!&quot; section as I could not identify a
specific help address in the web page.
I would also appreciate it if you could supply me the e-mail address of
Kyle Wade at VW Motorsport, from whom I bought my 2nd ECU, as I will be
needing another one (and I can't reach the old address I have on him). If
you can refer other suppliers of used parts, I would be most greateful.
Thank you in advance for your help (I sure do need it!)
Regards, 
Manolet Gonzalez
