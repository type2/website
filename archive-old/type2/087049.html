&gt; &lt;&lt; Makes since. I have seen many a split bus gas flap bent by a thief who was
&gt; to dumb to know he could stick his screw driver in the &quot;key hole&quot; and open
&gt; it a lot more easily than he could rip the flap back. They aren't apposed to
&gt; doing body damage to your vehicle.
&gt; 
&gt; ing in it when parked. Some thief ripped the sh*t out of the top to get to
&gt; the inside handle of the unlocked door...

yeah, someone broke my bus vent window to open my unlocked bus and they
stole what?  a case of adult diapers I was hauling for someone!

still haven't gotten that vent window fixed right.
