That is what the local VW dealer told me. I have a 1973 with dual Solexes and an automatic tranny. The dealer told me that the 1700 and the 1800 were available in 1974.

&gt;    From what I hear, 1974 had 1700 engines. I have a dual carbed 1700
&gt;engine with an automatic tranny. This setup is completely bone stock!!!

Where did you hear that?  Every manual I've seen states otherwise.  1974
model year U.S. busses came with 1800 engines from the factory.
