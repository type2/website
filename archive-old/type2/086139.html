Subject: RE: [T2] RE: Mexican hatch seal

&gt; Would this apply to the seals that GoWesty sells?  They are labelled as
&gt; German in their online catalog.


Yes.  I would doubt that it's an intentional deception. I don't think some
vendors realize that the &quot;genuine&quot; seal has actually been from VW/Brazil for
several years now.
