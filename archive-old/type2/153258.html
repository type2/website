Subject: Vacuum Line Question

I bought a new EMPI carburetor for my '70 deluxe's new Dual Port 1600.

 

There are two vacuum ports on the carburetor, One on the front by the idle
adjustment screw and one on the side above the mixture adjustment screw. The
one on the front is much larger than the one on the side.

 

Question: Which port do I block off and which do I use for the vacuum
advance on the distributor?

 

Thanks,
