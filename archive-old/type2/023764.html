Hi,

 Hmm, I don't think buying a used 911 engine is a good way to
save money compared to rebuilding a type-4. Type-4 parts look 
cheap compared to 911 parts (ask Sami what it cost him to get
his carbs rebuilt!).
 The 2.7 needs upgrades to be reliable in a 911, let alone in
a bus (chain tensioners, head studs, fan, exhaust...) so getting
a good one is important (and hard to do cheaply). Buying a used 
one is a gamble with quite high stakes.

 If a really good stock pancake (balanced, cc'd etc.) isn't
powerful enough, then your options are pretty poor, or pretty
dear, depending on how you look at it.

 I am still hoping to go the 911 route someday (long termers 
must be starting to laugh at this :-) but I expect it to be 
expensive (and wouldn't be likely to choose a 2.7).
 Meanwhile, my stock carburetted 2.0l will cruise faster 
than I'd be happy to drive it without suspension upgrades
and on the hills it's not too painful on the roads I use.

Cheers,
	 W.
