This is difficult to find unless it's happening.  But for good measure check
the tightness and cleanliness of the connections on the starter solenoid and
the the bolt that holds the earth (ground) strap to the body behind the
battery.

When it next happens have a test meter handy and check for power at the line
fuse for the blower at the top of the engine compartment .

Ground the meter on the battery -ve then  put the other contact on the
supply side of the fuse.

If you have power there re-test using a suitable ground point NOT on the
battery. Losing power here indicates a faulty ground strap.

If there is power in both cases then the problem is almost certainly in the
wire from the solenoid to the fuse box.

No power in either test would indicate a suspect wire from the battery to
the solenoid.
