Subject: [T2] generator issues

&gt;on a 1971 1600 I am testing the generator because the PO put the battery
&gt;cables on backwards and the red light is on

This would indicate stuck ( burnt ) points in the voltage regulator.
Light remains on with ignition off. Replace regulator.

&gt; I switched the cables and put in
&gt;a new starter, that was fried. so to test the voltage reg, it says to remove
&gt;the b+51 wir but on mine there are 2 wires, should I remove both.

Should only be one wire, B+51 is battery output and is 12 volt hot always.

&gt; I tried that just to see hooked up the tester started the bus with both wires away
&gt;from each other and anything else, nothing reading on the gauge.

Define gauge. Multimeter? Hooked up where ?

&gt;I touched the ground from the tester to the ground on the generator and the positive to
&gt;the red and white wire and the gauge went backwards.

Would seem to indicate the meter is reversed.
You are only reading battery output voltage.
Test the meter directly at the battery.
Also, you will need to polarize the generator.
This is probably the reason the regulator failed.
And replace the defective regulator.
