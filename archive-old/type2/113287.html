&gt;- I did have a significant fuel leak from one of the fuel tank vent line

&gt;starting the engine, otherwise it would have caught fire for sure. I'm going
&gt;to refrain from topping the tank off until I can get to all the other little

That one is always the worst. I modified this image a while back to hilite the problem:
