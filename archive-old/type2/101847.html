Subject: RE: [T2] tire pressure in '71 

&gt; The tire pressure for any vehicle is found on
&gt; the tire side wall. 
&gt; 
The tire pressure on the sidewall is clearly
marked &quot;MAXIMUM TIRE PRESSURE.&quot;  That should be
self explanatory.  It is the maximum PSI that the
tire can withstand.  The tire manufacturer has no
idea what vehicle you will put the tire on or how
much load you will carry.  So the tire
manufacturer cannot tell you what the pressure is
for your vehicle.  

The recommended tire pressure for your vehicle is
in the Bentley.  The 40 rear and 32 front sounds
right, but who knows.  My Bentley went with my 74
Westy to the new owners, so I don't have one to
look up the number.  I recall that it changes a
little from year to year.  Maybe someone will
look it up.  It's in the specs near the back of
the book.

You should follow the Bentley specs unless....
you have passenger tires with a max pressure of
35, as waaaaaaaaay to many of you do.  I suppose
then you should only pump the back tires up to
35.  You should also take everything out of your
bus including the interior (especially if you
have a camper interior) and remember to pray next
time you make a sharp turn on hot tires... all to
save $10-15 per tire instead of buying the 185R14
Reinforced or 185R14 Commercial tires.
