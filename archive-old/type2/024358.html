Hi all,
I'm in the process of installing some new parts in my '71 Bus tranny's
nose-cone. I have the nose-cone off and I notice, aside from having two
back-up light switch's, that the two spots where the bottom two
selector levers would touch(?), have been ground away, leaving two
distinct 'indents'. The spot where the top selctor lever would
touch(?), is where the second back-up light switch is screwed in. Any
opinions as to why someone would grind out those spots like that? And
why the two back-up light switch's?...hmmmm?
Thanks,
Rick
