Subject: Ohio bus event rapidly approaching

Since its Friday and all:
It is now less than 2 months to go until the Third
Annual VW Buses, Boats, &amp; Bands Bash held just north
of Cincinnati, Ohio on May 16-18. The event will
feature camping, canoeing, LIVE music, Full Moon Bus
Club Breakfast Burritos (reason enough to come right
there!)
Here's the event web site:
