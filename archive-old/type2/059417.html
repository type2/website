The butterfly valves on both carbs should be closed when it's cold.  That's
what chokes the engine.

It's sorely maltuned, and the oil filler cap is so tight that I
&gt;had to remove the funnel fitting just to get some oil in it.

Don't necessarily blame the P.O..  The caps have a tendancy to tighten up
for some reason.  I leave mine on pretty loose.
