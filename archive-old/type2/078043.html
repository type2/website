Subject: Re: [T2] rear suspension

Your wheels should both be vertical, but with age, the trailing arms
sometimes twist and the wheel angles.  No adjustment for this, you need to
replace the arm, or live with the lean.  It may wear the tire some, but
other than that, there really isn't any problem.

&gt; My right rear wheel leans in at the top, but my left rear wheel seems
&gt; near vertical.  Which is correct for a bus, and where is this angle
&gt; adjusted?
