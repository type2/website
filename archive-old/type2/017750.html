&gt;      I well recall one day laying under a Subaru with a gas welding
&gt; torch, welding on the frame, and hearing this strange noise, sounded
&gt; like boiling water. Couldn't figure out what it was, so I shut off the
&gt; torch for a minute, the sound continued.
&gt;      Then I realized that the gas tank was right behind what I was
&gt; welding, and what I heard boiling was gasoline. You can guess how fast I
&gt; scooted out from under that car, eh?
&gt;      Later on I got the job done, just stuck a shovel in between to
&gt; deflect the flame/heat from the tank.

Harmon and Tristan:
I think there's a lot more EXPLOSION danger from an empty tank. Very
little danger from a full tank AS LONG AS the gas stay in the tank. Once
there is gas on fire and running onto the floor: then you got a
heap-o-trouble. So my two cents worth is to avoid welding in the area of
the inlet and outlets of the tank, and just leave the gas in there. All
the usual caveats apply: Fire extinguisher, push the bus outside, but
most of all: consider every move you make before you do it.
Removal of the tank would be ideal, but what about the drips?
The best thing to purge the tank with would be nitrogen. All first-class
air conditioning technitions purge the lines with nitrogen while
sweating/brazing to keep down the scale inside the lines. Borrow a
bottle and regulator from your friendly A/C man. The bottles are a bit 
expensive- seems like a little more money than welding  gas. 
Probably a lot cheaper than ANY accident though.
