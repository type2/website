Subject: Re: [T2] Fort Collins CO living

Ever checked any of the long term camp sites?

Also - - - have you checked with your local University? Sometimes they have 
dorm rooms for free for folks that watch the building and it's occupants.

Been there, done that.

&gt;Hi.  This is a random try, but I have recently been living out of my '79 westy
&gt;on my freinds' rented property, and their landlord explained to me that he
&gt;could not allow it; therefore, I have nowhere to reside in my mobile home.  I
&gt;was curious if anyone on this kind list could help me out with suggestions or
&gt;had a square of land (or garage) they would consider renting.  I am currently
&gt;doing work for a masters thesis at CSU, so I have to stay around Fort Collins,
&gt;but would be happy to pay rent and am completely self-sufficient with my setup
&gt;(no electricity or water needed).
&gt;Your help is sincerely appreciated, and thanks for reading this.
&gt;mark
&gt;ps.  If you could please reply to my email (simon6_at_engr.colostate_dot_edu) then we
&gt;can get in touch by  phone/person.
