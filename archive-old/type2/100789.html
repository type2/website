Subject: RE: [VB] Bus Sightings

A month ago, I went into my local Big 5 Store, (Sporting Goods in the LA
area), and they had a foam bodyboard, manufactured by Whammo Corp.  It has a
picture/drawing of a red &amp; white 21/23 window deluxe sitting at the beach,
complete with the VW emblem emblazoned on the front of the bus.  It was
about $13-14, so I bought one to put in my bus.  VWOA Legal would have a
field day with this one, especially with a fairly major corporation like
Whammo.  At $14 each, I'm considering going back and buying their entire
stock.
