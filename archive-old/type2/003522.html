Hi all!

I have great news! I can keep my bus!

I am sorry to all who inquired about Jethro, the '77 auto bus, but I have
been offered a deal that I can't pass up. A friend of mine who works at a
shop here in town (plug *Bugs 'n' Bunnies* plug) just recieved a '78 van
that has been in a front end crash, but the engine is in great shape. In
fact, my friend rebuilt it not to long ago.

So.....

An engine for $300!     Whoooooooohhhhh!!!!!!!

If anbody is interested in an '87 Vanagon though, she is still for sale.

Thanks,

Don &amp; Christina Preston
