Subject: [T2] Central NY-2 Buses in salvage yard
Content-Disposition: inline

For those listers in the central NY area, I would let you know that there are 2 buses currently sitting in the salvage yard of Auburn's Pick&amp;Pull.  

There is a 71 Transporter that has been picked through pretty good, but it has good body panels and all the glass except windshield, and some internals.

Also, a 72 westy with dash, seats, body, rims and glass still intacted.  Engine is there, but missing carb. **Bring wasp sprey with you** 

For those familular with Pick&amp;Pull, they crush down cars after a while when they feel the cars have been picked over enough.  It would be a shame to have all that glass and body panels go to waste.
