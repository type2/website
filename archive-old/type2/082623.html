Subject: Fuel Pump for F.I.

When my fuel pump was locked up, I posed to the same
question to the list.  I was directed to look for a
fuel pump to fit a mid 80's ranger.  The parts store
had one for $70, over half off of new one specced for
VW.  I went to the boneyard and scored one with a six
month warranty for $25.  it came off of an 87 Ranger,
frame mounted fuel pump is what they called it.  It
even had a bosch number on it, genuine bosch. Another
listee had someone check the fuel flow capacities and
these guys were almost identical.

So there you go, I hope this helps,
