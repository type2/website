I buy parts from the VW dealers around DFW from time to time and have found
that
they still can get more parts than I had thought.  The parts that they can
get don't always make sense.  For example, I got a door window glass for a
Bug convertible but they didn't have fuel line.  They had master cylinder
fluid reservoirs but not exhaust system parts.  Go figure!
