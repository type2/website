Subject: gas coming out of Pushrod tubes WHA??

    Okay, I see that one of the pushrod tubes is leaking on the right
side of my motor.  So I pull out the motor and take off the head.  Out
flows a couple of gallons of grimy gasoline, yes gasoline.  My fuel pump
(moderately new, brazilian) had failed and was leaking into the motor
through the bottom of the pump and had filled up the engine quite nicely
overnight.  Wouldn't have figured it out without the archives.
    Yes I am thanking my lucky stars that I noticed that teenie leak
while on my back and not in some ugly run away molotov cocktail
scenario.
    So today I replaced the pushrod tubes on that side and put
everything back together.  Oh yes, I am also going to replace that fuel
pump.  I drained the oil and am hoping everything is okay now (sigh).  I
was thinking I would run the new oil for a week and then change it again
just to be on the safe side.
    Is there a way to make sure the new pump I buy is okay (safe)  Do I
have any choice besides the Brazilian one?  Did I just get a bad one?

Mahalo for listening and for your input

Greg
