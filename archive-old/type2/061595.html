Subject: SLOW AND SLOWER

what's all this Fuss-----
----about a VW BUS??
driving a brick that goes so slow--
--that when the red light turns green, people think it's a no-go---
life in the lane, far to the right--
---slow and slower , day or night--
but speed is not the goal of us--
---for if it were , we would not drive a VW bus--
at speeds we maintain. slow and slower--
--we never miss by thr road side, a lovely flower--
this is our prize--
--a feast for our eyes--
slow and slower we enjoy our ride--
--traveling fast give us no pride--
our enjoyment is the world, traveling the slow lane--
--and by going slow , we have this to gain--
life is a joy , keeping this slow plan--
--we have a better understanding of our fellow man.
