Subject: AIRS heads-up, trip planned

hi folks,

just a heads up, I am leaving Atlanta in my '70 Westy tonight for the 
Denver area for 12 days.  new rebuild, new tires and everything is 
dialed in, not expecting any issues of course, I have my s&amp;*t together. 
  please drop me an email if you are on the route:

Atlanta-Chattanooga-West-TN-Cape Girardeau MO-US 50 across Kansas 
(maybe) and somewhere connect up to some US Rte to Denver ETA by Thurs. 
night hopefully, Friday OK too.  thanks in advance.  last time I did 
this trip in 1999, I got stuck in Dodge City with a bad generator for 3 
days (you know what they say about getting out of Dodge).

Thanks also to Bus Depot for getting my spare parts order, complete,  
delivered today after ordering last Wed.!!!  I tried to make sure on my 
end that everything would be here in time, and Kay at Bus Depot did her 
best to ensure that everything was shipped.  Overall kudos to Ron for 
Bus Depot's efficiency much improved over the past 6 years.  Looking 
forward to the front Konis when I get back.
