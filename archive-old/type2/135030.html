Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch Problem

&gt;I have a 68 bus with a stock 1600SP. My clutch has been giving me a 
&gt;problem.
&gt; Its like the cable just doesn't pull enough. When I adjust it so there is
&gt; enough free play at the end. The clutch doesn't engage enough for me to 
&gt; shift.
&gt; When I adjust it enough to engage it enough to shift, the clutch seems to 
&gt; not
&gt; disengage to a point where it slips a little. So i have replaced the 
&gt; cable,
&gt; bowden tube, throw out bearing, the cross shaft and bushing, the clutch 
&gt; itself
&gt; and the spring on the cross shaft. I have not replaced the rear main seal
&gt; behind the fly wheel but thats it. So I stumped....If anybody has gone 
&gt; thru
&gt; this or can think of something, anything, I would be most
&gt; grateful........

Chad,

What about the pressure plate. Did you replace it? As a kit? I sounds to me 
like the clutch disc is bad or the pressure plate is flat i.e. no more 
spring. The disc could be bad from oil (rear main leak)but you said it's 
new.. oh another thing the bracket that holds the boden tube on the trans 
these always wear and brake. Check that out. Also the clutch lever thing, 
that the cleavis clip goes into that is bolted to the pedal. These wear and 
the hole gets all oblonged. Sorry about the bad luck that sound a lot of 
work pulling the engine and putting it back in, pulling puting ect.
