Hi,

Assuming your distributor is constructed the same as those for VW flat 4s I have dealt with...

At the bottom of the distributor there is a ring with teeth offset to one side that mesh with the gear inside of the crank case. They should be offset in the same direction as the rotor arm points.
The ring is held on by a split pin that goes right through the shaft - so if the pin were removed the ring could be rotated 180 degrees and the pin replaced. thus rotating the distributor 180 degrees.
You would have two self canceling errors and the vacuum canister could be aligned to a position were it does not foul anything.

I must emphasise that I have not done this,  so do not know of any problems with the setup; any insights from others welcome.

Good luck

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; I am doing my rear wheel bearings tomorrow, I already have the bearings and
&gt; the seals.  Any special tools I will need?  I still need to get the grease.
&gt; 
&gt; Also I just ordered a Bosch 050 to replace my 009.  But my distributor is
&gt; out 180 degrees and I just read on the list that this distributor won't work
&gt; 180 degrees out (hits something)  Is there a special tool to fix this
&gt; problem?  I have heard if you mess up turning the gear around it is a VERY
&gt; BAD thing.
&gt; 
&gt; This is all on a 73 bus..
&gt; 
&gt; TIA
