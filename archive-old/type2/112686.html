&gt;&gt;I did the very same thing the other day from a local hose distributor but
&gt;&gt;mine is black. I tried heating it in hot water to temporarily strech it and
&gt;&gt;even put a little oil on it to help it on. I eventually gave up. It is 3/4&quot;
&gt;&gt;hose. What size did you get?  Time to get out the Dremel!
&gt;&gt;

    I knew somebody would be asking me for the size but to be honest I 
don't know exactly what size it is but I'm almost positive that it is 
3/4&quot;.  I do remember that the guy said the next size up would be 1&quot; and 
judging by the fact that you were also resorting to the oil and hot 
water stretching makes me believe that we're dealing with the same size.

&gt;Doesn't look bad at all. To bad you couldn't have bought black hose. Then it
&gt;would hardly stand out like the blue does. Thanks for the tips!
&gt;  
&gt;

    Good point about the black hose.  It's the only thing I'd do 
differently.  But I admit,  blue is my favorite color .
