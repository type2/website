Sorry, but I have to object to this last instruction.  After using the
time and equipment at your local welding supply outfit you should be
willing to pay a few extra bucks to buy from them as well.  If you know
exactly what you need, by all means buy from Harbor Freight, but don't
steal customer service from your local full-service outfit!
