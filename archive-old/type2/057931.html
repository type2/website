&gt;&gt; I just got my 1973 Westy back from the shop today and a light keeps
&gt;&gt; going on. It is right below my speedometer, a little to the right. It
is
&gt;&gt; yellow and has a small &quot;B&quot; on it. It has flickered for a while then
it

&gt;P.S. Before you start, make sure the parking brake switch is working 
&gt;properly, because it is hooked up to the brake warning light.

73's don't have the parking brake warning light.  Anyone know which year
they added that nice little feature?

Anyway, your problem may be as simple as being low on brake fluid so
check the reservoir right away.  If it is low, you need to fill it and
then watch it over the next few week.  If it continues to go down, you
have to figure out where it's going.  If there's plenty of fluid and the
light still comes on, then you've either got a problem with the brake
master cylinder or else one or both of the switches on the master
cylinder are bad.

Is the light on all the time or does it go on and off sometimes.
