Subject: Weber carb adjustment

Hello all:

I am looking for help in adjusting my Weber carb. It's on my 72 Campmobile.
Recently, I ambitiously set out to adjust the timing, which I did with my
strobe light to specs. Engine sounded pretty smooth ... I drove happily away
... then after 1 mile noticed thick smoke streaming from the engine
compartment. Was smoky everywhere ... turn around and park it type of smoke
...
So, I'm suspecting that things are totally out of alignment in terms of the
carburetor and the timing.

Suggestions?

Tim T.
