&gt; Next thing ya know, someone's going to install a wood stove in his Bus. Wood
&gt; fired automotive heat, the perfect accessory for the Bus owner with too damn
&gt; much time on his hands. It's reasonably efficient. It won't run down your
&gt; battery, you don1t have to worry about the Eberspacher setting the Bus on
&gt; fire, and the kids can roast marshmallows over it on long trips!
