Subject: VW Yard Sale - San Antonio, TX

I guess this never made it to the type2 list from the Vintage list.  

There's a VW sale going on in San Antonio, TX 10/10/98 ( next Saturday)
from 8am - 3pm.  It's at a place called Import Cars and Parts at 12031
Bulverde Rd.  They've been in business for at least 10 years+ and have
never been a 'salvage yard' - dealing mostly in repairs and rebuilds.
In fact, the top-end of my 73 was done there prior to my purchasing it 8
years ago.

Anyway, here's how the flyer reads:  &quot;Bug, Ghia, Bus, Type IV, Fast
Back, Square Back, Fox, Jetta, Golf, Rabbit, Dasher, Scirocco, Vanagon,
Quantum, Thing, Race Cars(s) - 26 years of private stock.  5 acres never
open to the public.  Bring your tools.  All Sales Final.  No refunds,
Cash, MasterCard, Visa.  If you don't buy it I'll crush it!!!&quot;

Anyone wanting to come to SA for this is welcome to shack up here for a
night  or two - just let me know ahead of time.  Otherwise, I'll let
everyone else know what they missed (or didn't miss) on Monday.
