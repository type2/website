Subject: Re: &lt;FMBC&gt; set timing: whistle?

sorry looks like that link was broken

goto the EASTWOODCOMPANY_dot_com  webpage
and search for part number #46048
Find TDC (top dead center) with the &quot;whistle&quot; quickly, easily, and precisely 
every time! As the piston rises in the cylinder, compressed air escapes 
through the whistle. When the Whistle stops, the piston is at TDC. It's that 
simple! Dual thread pattern (14mm and 18mm) with attached 22&quot; hose fits most 
engines. Attached extension reaches into tight access areas.

&gt;check the link below, has anyone ever seen one of these gadgets?
&gt;looks like it might be easier to set timing - instead of a static light
