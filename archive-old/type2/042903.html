Steve

Thanks for this. Tips welcomed as I have traced as much as I can and still
can't work out what is going on. I even have a spare column (Bought for the
new wheel) which yealded some clues especially about the insulation of the
shaft and where the tag should be at the bottom.

While the button on the dash may work, I have an irrational desire to put
the horn back in the wheel. I also need to re-paint the support at the top
so I suspect the column has to come out then anyway.

Thanks again

Phil,

Sorry not to get back to you sooner... been busy chasing my own bug-bears
:-)  The horn ciruit is fairly simple...  from the fuse box, there is a
black wire with a yellow trace that runs straight to the horn.  Simple so
far :-)  From the other terminal on the horn there is a brown wire that
runs over to the bottom of the steering column, up the steering column and
plugs into a terminal under the horn ring.  There is a single connector
between the bottom of the steering column and the horn in this brown wire
and a place where it passes thru a fairlead under the black cover on the
base of the column.  Again... simple, yes?  OK, now the bitch...  If that
brown wire comes in contact with the body of the car anywhere along its
length, the horn is gonna blow all the time. Also, the steering shaft and
shell need to be isolated from ground (at least on my '73). 

The brown wire almost certainly needs replacement, which is a metric bitch
(1 metric bitch = 2.2 english bitches :) as the insulation is probably
worn thru somewhere along its length and pulling a new wire up the
steering column is &quot;quite difficult&quot;.  If the button on the dash works, be
happy unless you are restoring the car.  If you are doing a resto, write
me back and I will feed some tips.
