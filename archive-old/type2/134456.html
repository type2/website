Subject: Garage for rent?

Hey, just getting back into busses after a couple year hiatus.  Had to sell my
68 westy for financial reasons.  Things are better.  Hopefully aquiring a 70
westy in the near future for resto.  Does anyone in the massachusetts
(merrimac valley/haverhill) area have some garage space I can use/rent?  Drop
me a line, thanks!!!  mlibby_at_mailshack_dot_com

Libby
