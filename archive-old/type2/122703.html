Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Recommendations

On Wed, 17 Dec 2003 10:40:41 +0000 
Peter Pankonin said something about Re: [T2] Engine Recommendations:

&gt; It's not a whole bunch. I get what looks like a teaspoon sized blob
&gt; after the engine runs for a bit and it looks like it might be coming from
&gt; the back near the tranny. Maybe it's the rear main seal?  

First thing you need to learn is that the tranny is NOT in *back* of the
engine. If it is, you have a problem. &lt;grin&gt;

When talking about your Bus' mechanicals always remember FIF (Front is
Front). Everything is discussed in relation to the front/rear orientation
of the vehicle.

You did get one thing right -- the seal you're talking about IS called the
REAR main seal. But it's at the FRONT of the engine. That one still
confuses me. ;-)
