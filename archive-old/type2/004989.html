&gt; ...I suspect i have. I just had the front brakes [pads and
&gt; rotors] replaced in my '71 westy, and it cost a fortune.
&gt; $184/rotor, just for the rotor. this didn't include the pads,
&gt; labor or tax!  If it's really ridiculously off, i'm going to raise
&gt; a stink, since i had it done at a large chain.


I sell them for less than $50, and that's for original-equipment ATE's.  I
know local places can't compete with mail order prices, but almost 4 times
the price seems really excessive to me. In fact I've never heard of anyone
paying that much for a bus rotor, and customers tell me horror stories about
price gouging all the time.  If I were you, I'd certainly raise a stink.
