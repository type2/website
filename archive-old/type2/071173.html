&lt;&lt; Hey Y'all,
   I talked to you about a week ago about my 70 Bus and its 
trans  trouble. I got a call from Todd Hill and he gave me the  
info that I  needed to make the swap to the 091. I pulled the 
002 and it is locked up  internally so I pulled the needed parts 
from the 002 and put them on the  091. It went very smoothly 
for the most part and it works pretty good.   Now the only 
problem I am having now is that the trans is a bit loud in all 
gears. Does anyone know of any additives that might quiet it 
down?   Its making noise in all gears so I suspect that its the 
ring and pinion.   I filled it with new oil after installing it so its 
not oil level. Would a synthetic help?
   I would like to say a big thank you to Todd Hill for calling 
me at  home and giving me advice. It was only one phone call, 
but it was all  the information that I needed to proceed with 
confidence. This list is  great and the people on it are the best! &gt;&gt;

Hello Scott,

I'd try a synthetic such as Redline MTL but any gear lube or
additive will not magically repair worn parts.   A worn out part
is worn out and will need to be replaced.   Is the noise a 'howl'
type noise that seems to be louder when you are under load?
If so, then I would agree that it is probably the ring and pinion 
set that is causing the problem.
