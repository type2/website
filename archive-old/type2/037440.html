&gt; &quot;As to the tinted option, I've heard that because of the high driving
&gt; position in our buses, You would be looking right at the tinted border if you
&gt; are fairly tall.&quot;

I chose the tinted option when I had a windshield installed the other week and
I have no problem with the tint being in my view. I in fact like the tint
better than the no tint at the top because it definitly helps on the glare. Of
curse the tint is no lower than the bottom of a sun visor that has been turned
down.

If you still have the option I would chose the tinted window.
