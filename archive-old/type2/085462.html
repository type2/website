Subject: Re: [T2] BN4 Pics, diagrams

Espar sent us these manuals with the intent of helping out the club.  I know
people have heard Espar will send them photo copies, but this is a way for
people to donate to a club that is helping further the hobby.  We turn
around and use the money for sponsoring free meals at campouts and
sponsoring seminars like the gas heater one we did.  This is a win, win
situation for both parties, we each benifit.  Raising money is difficult at
best, this is just one way.

So purchasing the manuals benifits a large group of bus people, this is just
one way we can fund our events.

By the way, these are not the photo copies, but the real manuals, much nicer
than a copy.  

I take it you don't buy over priced girl scout cookies :)

&gt; You can get the photocopies of any and all parts, repair, install and
&gt; troubleshooting manuals for ANY Eberspacher heater that VW used just by
&gt; requesting them from Espar, at Espar_dot_com. They will mail them to you at NO
&gt; CHARGE, in about a week.
&gt; FYI,
&gt; Robert
