Subject: Re: sliding door latch

For you poor souls without owner's manuals:

In case anyone's curious about the specifics of what Brian's talking
about, after you close your sliding door you're supposed to pull UP on
the outside handle to seat the latching mechanism and it pulls the back
part of the door completely in place. ALSO, to lock your door from the
inside, you close the door and then pull back on the bottom of the
handle (for you early Westy owners with your original two-ended handle),
to seat the latch, and then you can push the little locking lever. If
you don't pull back on the latch, it doesn't seat all the way and the
lock inside won't engage.

Now, this is the case on Brian's 71 and my 73, but I found out when I
was trying to close the door on a 79 that its action is the reverse from
what I'm used to. So...I don't know what year it changed, and I'm also
curious to find out.

P.S. If anyone wants to seriously enhance their karma, I'm desperately
seeking that two-ended early bay Westy (thru 74?) inside sliding door
handle. I get a cramp in my hand trying to reach down between the spice
rack table and the door to open the beast.
