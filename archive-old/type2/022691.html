Subject: 32-34PDSIT parts carbs

Hilo Bussers,

I have a couple of 32-34 PDSIT parts carbs.  I say parts carbs cuz that's
all they're good for.  They are free to a good home (on a bus).  I'm in San
Diego.  Come and get em if you want em.

Hey, anyone know the color code for a 72 orange Westy?  I'm going to paint
soon.

Tony 72 Westy....73 Thing
