Subject: Re: [T2] Windshield wipers

call ghostbusters.... naw seriously try pulling the fuse for the windshield wiper yet?
try that and see if they still go..? may be the motor but is rather strange....
your wiper motor should be on a adapter plug.... and the motor its self isnt that bad once you get past the radio wireing and the front vent levers and the vent pipes...running up the middle under the dash...
not a fun task exspecially if you want to save the vents and all....
but once youre there if indeed you do end up and pull it there is only one bolt holding it down and i think its like a 10- 13mm or so?  pull the adapter plug and turn the bolt take it out and pull the arms and all towards the dash and under shes yours.. ohh but if you dont loosen and take off the wipers and bolts from outside you wil never get it loose.. LOL,.,.
good luck./...// any problems getting it out let me know.. any problems with the wireing for it.. well good luck is all i will say i still havent got mine wired but do have it in...
'rain x works like a dream 
peace

sounds like the motor has flipped out or you have something touching somewheres check that adapter plug really well and think about anything what you have done past day or so diffrent maybe..?

Hello I have a small problem. I went out to start my
bus(78 Westy) and the wipers started going. I thought
maybe I bumped the switch, that but no matter what I
did they didn't stop. They just go at slow speed, and
would not shut off. I thought something in the switch
broke, so I pulled the switch out and it is fine. Even
with the switch unplugged the wipers continue to go. I
have unplugged the connector at the motor itself, and
that has stopped the wipers. I've traced the wires as
best as I can while standing on my head, but I don't
see any shorts or bad wires. This has never happend
before, So does anyone have a suggestion? I really am
going to hate having to pull the motor if I have to.
So any input would be nice, maybe I've missed
something. Thanks for any help,
