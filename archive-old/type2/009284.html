&gt; 
&gt; What I'm going to do with my diesel conversion in my '73 is use two
&gt; small radiators w/fans and put them in the rear airscoops, instead of
&gt; running them up to the front and cutting out the nose. Somebody else
put
&gt; one on top and built a scoop, but I figure you can just use a Y-pipe
and
&gt; two smaller radiators in the stock airscoops. Maybe bike radiators or
&gt; some of the better quality oil coolers, etc., something fairly long
and
&gt; narrow.

I've seen it done with a single radiator on the left side of the
engine bay.  It was mounted in a slanted fashion with the bottom end
outboard and the top end inboard.  The top edge was about 1/2 inch
below the top of the engine bay and about 3 inches inboard of the left
edge of the engine bay door.  As I recall, the radiator was a stock
unit from a Japanese car (perhaps Subaru, since the engine was a
Subaru).  This left the right side of the engine bay for the battery.

One key to this installation was that the radiator was well sealed to
the engine bay all around its perimeter, so air could not recirculate
around the edges of the radiator.  I've seen a number of water-cooled
conversions that had cooling problems and all of them had unsealed
radiators.  You can't predict the airflow in the back of a bus, so you
had better make sure it goes where you want!

The radiator also had a stock Japanese electric fan on the outboard
side of the radiator.  It was shrouded to direct the airflow properly
to the radiator.

You might also want to consider having a custom radiator made for the
application.  The cost will be high, but it might be cheaper than
trying to fit a standard radiator to the opening.  There are a number
of outfits out there that can make a radiator in any shape you might
want.
