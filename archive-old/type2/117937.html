Subject: Rear vent window seal installation

Greetings,

I've checked the library and the archives but to no avail.  Has anyone used 
installed a new rear vent window seal on its frame?  I'm having a hard time 
getting the rubber to sit correctly in the channel between the two right 
angles of the frame if that makes any sense. It is thight and the seal is 
bowed and not sitting flat in its channel.  This is the part of the frame 
that both sides are curled in.

Am I missing somthing? Some wierd sequence? I have the window in, the seal 
mostly on, it'd be done and ready to go on the bus just the narrow part of 
the seal and its tightness. I have not tried any lube or anything all 
assembly to this point has been dry.

This is the seal I got. Made or imported by WCM and an exact match of the 
original.

Any tips very welcome.

Thanks,
Brandt
