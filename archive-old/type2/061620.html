Subject: FS: Front 'Vanagon' Seats

Vanagon 'captain' chairs for front seats.
Comfortable.

Two -  Blue - fairly clean - will fit '77 on up.

Must see before purchasing.
Must pick up in Springfield VA.

$35 each, and if my math is right, $70 for two.

These have BOTH arm rests on each seat, and fit in
my '78 Westy with both arm rests..  I keep the
door-side arm rest folded up, and the door closes
nicely.
