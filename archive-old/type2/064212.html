Subject: Bus Web Page Update

I added a bunch of cool stuff to my web site today:

* New Hall of shame entries, including a pic of SOTO President Dave Heard
and all his 17 or so busses.  Now you know where the money goes...

* Pic of Charlie Hamill's ladder truck

* Pix of Todd Olmstead's '55 Deluxe

* Pix of Ed Hughes' (sp) '53 Deluxe
