&gt;    ...
&gt;    The essence of the California bill, is that if the car is sent in
&gt;    as part of the Accelerated Vehicle Retirement program (voluntary,
&gt;    or not) it is crushed.  Parts cannot be taken from any vehicle that
&gt;    is to be scrapped under the program.
&gt;    ...

Dan asked:

&gt;is it kosher for me to part a car out and then
&gt;get it crushed?

NO

&gt;how much money is the &quot;crush me&quot;
&gt;transaction worth?  
&gt;

$500 if pre-80 or $600 post-80. The vehicle must be currently registered. The vehicle must move under its own power forward and reverse.
