&gt; I DO have an impact driver, but perhaps I was using

&gt; under the impression you hit it with the hammer
&gt; first to set the cam,
&gt; then twist to remove the bolt with extra torque from
&gt; the driver.
&gt; However, if I'm reading what you said correctly, I
&gt; should be twisting
&gt; 1st, then hitting it with the hammer?
&gt; If so, I'll try that tonight.

Yes, you hold tension in the direction you want it to
go while you smack it. -BaH
