Subject: westy aux battery wiring

It's been a year since I wired the second battery into the hard top 
westfakia.  Now that I have a real Westy in addition to Bessie I did the 
job again.  This time around it was a much cleaner install.  There are 
only two pics as there isn't much to see.  That was the point.

The black plastic box was purchased at a local electronics store.  I 
mounted the fuse panel in the box and mounted the box on top of the 
electrical outlet cover.  I'm not worried ab out stuff sitting on top 
because it's enclosed and because the childs cot sits above it.

The radio, ipod charger / 12v outlet and the light over the sink are all 
running off the aux battery at present.
