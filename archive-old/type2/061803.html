Subject: re: Josh's funeral

Hello all, 

 I really don't have much to contribute since Charley Ford, Rob Dahlgren,
and Mike Ginsler have said it better than I ever can. I felt a need to be
there, even though I only knew Josh through e-mail. My wife and I were
talking about this &quot;need&quot; the night before the funeral and we both came to
the conclusion that our list is, in reality, a gigantic family composed of
folks from all walks of life.

 I get kidded alot from people who work with me about my bus. The one
question I ask them is...do other people who own (make of vehicle) wave at
you? Are they willing to drive 50 or 100 miles to help you out? Well,
having owned a varity of vehicles over the years, I have never met so many
just by owning a vehicle. Charley and I agreed that it takes a special
breed of people who willing to drive 20+ year old vehicles that don't
produce enough heat, requires constant maintenance, and just doesn't go
that fast!

 I don't know why Josh did what he did, but I know we lost a valuable
member of the family. Through it all, his life will be remembered more than
his death, and that is the way it should be!!!!
