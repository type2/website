&gt; &gt; All of the T2's I have ever seen had them, unless someone forgot to put

&gt; The one you're talking about is the one that goes in the front, under the
&gt; cab area.  That one is indeed supposed to be on every bus.

actually what I need is that blamed screw/bolt whatever that holds the
front on...I can not find a bolt or screw or skyhook that will fit the
hole, had to wire mine up...WHAT size is it???

or maybe my hole is really stripped

&gt; Incidentally, that item (211 703 611H, $39.95 in our catalog/website) has
&gt; now been discontinued.  We have perhaps 3 left, genuine VW and with a little
&gt; bit of surface rust from being at the bottom of the stack, and when they're
&gt; gone we probably won't see more.  So if you need one, grab one now while you
&gt; can...
