Subject: Re: [T2] 68 disk brake conversion/ powertrain upgrade Q's

  I've no idea. It would be awesome if the problem is as simple as 
changing out the support to a later one. I'd read in some T2 archives 
that folks trying to put a T4 into a 68 in particular had major 
problems with the support and their experience involved cut/weld/fab to 
do the conversion. Seemed excessive to me, but there was some mention 
of incompatibility with 68's.
  I'm pretty familiar with most splitty kinks these days, but Bay 
interchangeability is new to me. I once had a 69 Bay, but that was many 
many many moons ago, and if I only didn't know now what I didn't know 
then... well, I might be happy in my ignorance. :)
  However, since my thirst for knowledge seems not to diminish as the 
laugh lines get deeper, I guess I'm cursed with trying to learn yet 
More about these infernal internal combustion creatures we dig driving. 
So, anyone know what the difference is between the 68 support and later 
bays? Is there any difference?
Thanks
shin
