I'm leaving the country and need to get rid of my old van. Good
tires; hasn't run in a couple of years, body still pretty good;
previous owner built sink, stove, fridge, built in bed. Yours to tow
away.
this is around Danville, CA&quot;

as someone else said &quot;now you know as much as I do&quot;

Lemme know if you end up picking this up. I would, if I had the space, 
wasn't getting married in 5 weeks and contemplating a move to washington 
immediattely following. =)

Christopher
76 Westfalia &quot;jasper&quot;
