when i bought the 77 campmobile, he told me the fuel gauge wasn't working.
'but we haven't looked at it to figure out why,&quot; he said. figured it would be
something simple, like a blown fuse. fuse not blown.

within a few days begins a cascade of blown fuses and stuff not
working...interior lights first, then turn signals. dash turn signal indicator
stays on. all bulbs check out. check bentley's fuse panel layout...doesn't
agree with owner's manual.._dot_decide the owner's manual is more authoritative
and decide to go with that. open dash panel (very easy to do...screws not
connected to anything. need new clips to screw dash panel to). AC stuff makes
for tight working quarters. what's this? a ground wire not connected to
anything? and the EGR light disconnected from the panel with bulb removed? and
something extra, that *definitely* does not look like it belongs there. it
becomes obvious that the PO's college-age son had played fast and loose with
the electrical...he had a 'stereo' in it...

can't read the bentley wiring diagram to determine where the loose wire goes.
fallback position is to rely on logic...the kid didn't have a clue...maybe he
plugged stuff in wrong. remove the ground wire from the fuel gauge, plug in
the free wire...fuel gauge magically begins working! notice the emergency
flasher switch is verklempt...basically falling apart into its component
pieces. carefully remove and reassemble flasher switch. turn signals work!
replace blown fuses. emergency flashers work! knob cover missing. need new
emergency flasher knob.

still have an unconnected ground wire...no idea where it goes...all the gauges
and idiot lights (except the EGR light, of course) are working. anybody point
me to a photo of the in-dash wiring? not in haynes/bentley/muir/chilton.

next, need to tighten emergency brake cable. bus rolls on slight slope with
brake handle completely extended. crawl underneath. pleasant surprise!
underside of bus in truly excellent condition! unfortunately, AC cooling coil
mounted beneath emergency brake cable adjustment/equalizer bar. can't get to
it without removing the coil. do that tomorrow. spot the replacement horn PO
added to pass inspection. need stock horn. need stock steering wheel with
stock horn button.

engine runs good, but still too clackety. decide that PO's last valve
adjustment (done 1 day prior to purchase) probably done while engine warm.
need to readjust valves. wishing for hydraulic lifters. trying to decide if i
want to be *stock* or if i'm willing to taint my bus with stuff from a
different model year. also still has a slight problem getting started and
running rough until warm, and not as much 'juice' at speed as i think it is
supposed to have. decide it's in the FI...cold start valve, air intake sensor,
or other such. temperature sensor II is connected securely, haven't tested,
but hope it is functioning correctly. could be ignition system. check points
when i do the valve adjustment.

wondering about the cost of repairing damage to the nose from spare tire mount
and actual use of spare as a bumper. afraid to find out. moved spare to the
'official' location.

decide to drive the bus to work today.
