Subject: Re: [T2] Is there a EZ way to clean the tank?


TJ, please turn word wrap on in whatever mail program you are using.
For lots of people on the list it just comes out as 1 line that is about 
1,000 chars long!

At the time, I hadn't pulled a t4 engine in almost 18 years, so I went 
slow and tagged and bagged everything.  Engine pull was about
3 hours but I was in no hurry.  Pulled trans later.

Total to get the engine and tank out was about 4 hours.  Look at the
web site again and notice the red arrows in picture #1....would have been
a lot faster with list help had I know about these.

Take tank to radiator shop the next day.  Picked it up the next weekend.
Clean it out some more and then repaint outside with por-15.  I did *not*
use tank sealer on the inside as I could not get it clean enough for that
and could not figure out how to get the sealer on *all* of the inside 
correctly.  Hardly any rust inside the tank at all, mostly just rock hard
varnish!

Cheers, dave

&gt; TJ,
&gt; 
&gt; Did you *not* look at the pictures(#12) here?????
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/78bustankjob/
&gt; 
&gt; I resisted doing this for more than 3 months.  I should have done it  
&gt; first.&gt;&gt;
&gt; BTW, how long did it take to do that to yours when you did it?  
&gt; TJ, who thinks the one thing he prefers Old Beetles over Old Buses is the tank placement.
