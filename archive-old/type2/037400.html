Subject: Costa Rican adventure!

hi all,

Sorry to span all lists, but figured this might apply to all...

I am considering a journey to costa rica in may... have already renewed my
passport etc.

I hope to rent an aircooled VW/vanagon/kombi while there, but havent found
anyplace that does, could anyone offer any suggestions? (all i can find
are sport utes and subcompacts...)

Also, are there any interesting sites or attractions vw related (big
junkyards?)

Finally, any other information that you might have that will make our trip
enjoyable will be well recieved.

thanks,

Steve
