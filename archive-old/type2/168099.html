Subject: Re: [T2] White smoke

What's your weather been, Have rain lately?   White smoke  normally means 
water.  The hard start could have been rust on the  cylinder walls. 
 
Bad (Watery) Gas?  I have had 2 VW's come in where it seemed more like  water 
then gas that I drained from the tanks. 
 
 
You might want to have your battery checked out, most auto part places does  
it for free.
 
This is the time of year to put a little mystery oil in your gas, it helps  
with the condensation.
