Subject: Westy Sink Pump another idea
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I can actually provide some good info here instead of getting it all the
time.  The pump in my 74 westy was shot, so I went to my local RV guy and he
wanted like 30 bucks, so I went to the boating/fishing section of my local
Walmart and purchased a bilge pump for like $10 and a piece of hose and some
fittings at the local hardware store for about $2 (the fittings on the pump
were not compatible w/ the sink ... you might get lucky and not need the
fittings) the pump is more &quot;heavy duty&quot; than the RV ones and I even forgot
to put antifreeze in it last winter and it caused no problems.  As a bonus,
I have about 2X the water pressure I had before too.  I know we are not
talking about a lot of money here, but hell I'll take a tank of gas to go w/
my water pump anyday.
