Subject: muffler heat?

Folks, 

I have a question about muffler heat.  In my 78, I have converted to 
the 72-74 style of heater boxes/muffler.  All shields and flappers and 
everything else is in place and working.  The muffler is a stock stainless 
steel one from BD correct for the 72-74 setup.

However, my rear bumper gets really really hot!  Is this normal?
The engine temps are very normal at about 210 or so.

Just wondering....I don't remember this condition with the 78 stock 
muffler that was in before I switched, but didn't drive that much before the 
switchover.

Anyone else that has switched over and noticed this?
I'm beginning to wonder if the heat dump pipes are doing this or if it is 
just the muffler...pic here
