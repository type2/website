Subject: ME Challenge - Adding a Nose to a Bus

OK, here's a design project for a mechanical expert. 
How do you design and add a nose to a bus so as to
improve crashability?  I have a brick (1980 Westy),
and even it could use extra crush space.

A recent article in about_dot_com discussed the clever
engineering in the new beetle.  This got me thinking
about crash safety again.  The new beetle design has 5
crush zones, and I gather that many of these use
plastic and urethane foam to improve crashability.

I'm always impressed by those college design projects
that try to keep eggs from breaking when they fall
from a certain height (a la Humpty Dumpty).  What
doesn't work is trying to protect the eggs with soft
cushy material.  The designs that keep the eggs from
breaking, of course,  are those that add a crush space
to absorb the energy of the fall.

A great design for a bus would probably involve a
light weight nose with just the right amount of
stiffness to improve crashability.  Maybe the nose
could be dual purpose, and provide extra storage for
light weight items like lawn chairs.  Oh by the way,
it would also be great if this nose was
aerodynamically shaped so it improved the bus' gas
mileage.

Anyone want to form a team to explore this mechanical
engineering challenge and improve bus safety?  Hey,
maybe it's as simple as a cleverly designed tire
carrier/4X4 like protector for the front.
