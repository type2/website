Subject: Tires

I apologize in advance for bringing up this beat to death subject, but...

My bus is receiving a transplant that will give it a lot more power. I'm
interested in taller tires to reduce my engine RPMs. ( loss of cooling due
to slower fan speeds will not be an issue for me.) After searching the web
for tires that are rated for the required load, I've come to the conclusion
that 15inch rims would give me a much greater tire selection.
The problem with 15inch tires are that the majority of them are wider than
stock tires. My concern is tire rubbing and actually getting the tires to
install on the rear. I've hear of difficulties encountered getting the tire
to fit between the hub and fender during mounting. Can someone shed some
light on this. I've been out to
http://www.type2_dot_com/library/tires/kabayo.html . I'm just looking for some
personal experiences out there.

Also, I find it interesting that as I look through various tires available
sizes, I see that the maximum inflation pressures sometimes can jump from 35
to 50 PSI. Can anybody explain this? I would think that given the same
sidewall construction. the higher the PSI in the tire the stiffer the
sidewall.
