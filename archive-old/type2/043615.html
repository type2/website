Listees,

I've seen a few posts on &quot;protecting you bus&quot; and have some ideas, but how
do people keep their bus theirs?  I have been considering a fancy alarm that
just kills the ignition.  Obviously, it could do a lot more, but I'm just
looking for ways to prevent the vehichle from being started up.  I have a
locking engine lid, was planning on *some* kind of ignition kill, and maybe
an empty distributor wire coming from the coil.  Any other ideas?  Thanks
for any suggestions anyone may have.

Paul
