Subject: Wheel Bolt Patterns - Question...
Message-Id: &lt;4.2.0.58.19991013062548.00ab5610_at_pop.multipro_dot_com&gt;

Without re-opening debates on offsets, load capabilities, and all that 
stuff, I have a question.

Which cars and trucks and vans share the same wheel bolt patterns with the 
later model Baywindow busses?

And for you Beetle/Ghia/Type III folks - any cars that shared the 4 bolt 
pattern?

Last question - any of you ever had your rotors and drums re-studded? What 
was your cost? (And no I think I'll skip bolt on adaptors - scary!!)

My plan is that I have a set of OEM Porsche cookie cutter wheels and plan 
to use them on my bus. Have checked the basic fit and they should do nicely.

Has anyone heard of powder coating aluminum? I though about polishing these 
cookie cutters but they will be spending their entire lives in the weather, 
and powder coating - or painting is much less maintenance intensive. I 
haven't got time to constantly polish wheels, and they should be alot less 
in your face (read prone to get stolen).

Besides their good looks, these wheels will call for using a tire with a 
shorter sidewall, and this should help the Bay's wandering on the highway 
on windy days. 205/60-15 is almost exactly the same diameter as 185/70-14. 
I'll probably be running 205/65-15 tires though to fill the fenderwells a 
slight bit more, and get a slight amount of overdrive too. Something like 5 
mph for a given RPM.

Figure alot of people will have alot to say about this as any discussion 
about tires and wheels seems to really work like a powder keg. I don't want 
to tie up alot of bandwidth so let's skip the tire and wheel 
offset/strength debates. There's plenty of that in the archives.

I want to thank all of you (especially ADMIN!) for such a wonderful resource!
