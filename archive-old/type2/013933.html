Subject: [T2] engine rebuild

There are three parts you absolutely must keep up with when you
disassemble your engine:
1. Spring under your distributor, tie it to your distributor with a small
bundle tie.
2. Thrust washer under your distributor, tie it to your distributor drive
with a small bundle tie.
3. Three thrust washer/spacers on the flywheel end of your crankshaft,
don't bend them, don't change the stacking order. They should be the
proper thickness for your engine but you need to use a dial gauge and
check crank end play before you reassemble the engine.
Remember! Clean, Clean, Clean that is a big help in engine reassemble.
