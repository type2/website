Subject: Re: [T2] Please help me start this old bus!

congrates, now the hard part, wait, get the basics done BEFORE you try to
start it, I know it is tempting, been there, but it could be the
difference between a working engine and a broken engine.

.  drain ALL fluids
.  replace all fluids (flush if needed)
.  Change all fuel lines and filters
.  take out the spark plugs
.  squirt oil into the cyl thru the spark plug holes
.  come back tomorrow and ssquirt some more light oil into the plug holes
.  &quot;SLOWLY&quot; turn the crank clockwise BY HAND, don't force it at any point
.  do the squirt crank by hand again tommorrow
.  put a very thin oil (synthetic 5-50 maybe) into the engine and 
.  crank it over with the starter with all electrics disconected
.  when it cranks smoothly put plugs back in connect all electrics
.  start engine let run no more than 2-3 minutes, shut down
.  Change the oil and filter to whatever you plan on using regularly

now do the tune up and any other things you will need to do, new brakes
etc.

I may have missed a step so anyone else jump in

&gt; I just purchased my first bus ('77 bay) a few days ago and I'm really 
&gt; anxious to bring her back to life. The problem is she hasn't ran in half a 
&gt; decade and has been sitting as a lawn decoration ever since. I was just 
&gt; curious to know if there are certain things I should do to the gas tank and 
&gt; the engine (oil change, etc.) before I crank her up...any help is 
&gt; grateful...
&gt; thanks,
&gt; -Aaron
