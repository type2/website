Subject: got fuel pressure, spark, air, and compression, but no start.

Allright fellas,
  Since my bus stopped starting, i have learned a hell of a lot about my FI 
system. I learned all the factors of the cold start valve, the sensors, the 
AFM, and the infrequency of ECU failure. All of this because of the kindness 
of many peoples thoughts. 
    After checking all of the components that i could, i found that my 
injectors werent spraying any fuel. I had already checked for the electrical 
signal to the injectors and ruled out the ECU and wiring harness. I found 
that there was a weak pulsating light to my test light when the injectors 
were to be firing. I understand that this is the expected result.
    I figured that the injectors need two things to fire; fuel pressure, and 
electrical signals to tell them when to open. I knew that i had the 
electricity, so i went to my store and got a fuel pressure gauge. 
     I wasnt sure weather to expect the pump or the regulator to be bad, so i 
first opened the line at the cold start valve and took a reading at the end 
of the fuel line. When the ignition was turned on, the gauge didnt move, but 
when the engine was turned, it jumped to 100psi where the needle is pinned. i 
found this to be very odd, but figured to check another reading. I hooked up 
to a T-fitting between two injectors, and found that when the engine is 
cranked, the pressure goes to 38psi.
       I know that the system only requires 28, but i'm not sure myself that 
too much pressure would keep the engine from firing up. Also, this is a gauge 
that was made for fords, chevys ands such, and it had a valve to screw 
in-line that kinda resembled a tire valve. I took this off at the base of the 
gauge, and rigged up a fuel line that would adapt to fit my busses lines. I'm 
wondering if anybody knows if these valves carry any resistence before the 
gauge that would have to be considered for an accurate reading since i 
removed them. 
  I seem to have all the necessities; (fuel pressure, electricity to the 
injectors, spark, air) but cant get started. I handed this problem to a shop, 
but have been dicked around for the last few days, so i'm determined to get 
this problem solved myself. I borrowed my friends ECU and cylinder head temp 
sensor to swap parts and see if i can find it through the shotgun method. He 
has a running bus that is partialy disassembled, so i can use his parts to 
test mine. Its a 78 FI, and i'm gonna start the swaps tomorrow (sat) morning.
   If neither of these work, i'll try the injectors. 
        any advice on what i may be missing, doing wrong, or shouldnt be 
doing is greatly appreciated.
