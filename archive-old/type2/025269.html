Great and powerful list,

I am currently looking for two items for my 74 Westy and I was wondering if
anyone had them lying around and wanted to part with them.

The first is the plastic vent screen that goes behind the front grill. Mine
is terribly dry rotted and falling apart. Apparently this item is not
available in after market. I have thought of possibly fabricating something
that would work but thought I would check here first.

The second item(s) is the plastic directional vent covers for the defrost
vents on the dashboard. These are also dry rotted and crumbling.

If any one has or knows where to obtain these parts I would greatly
appreciate it. Thanks in advance.....Dana
