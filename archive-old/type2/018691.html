Subject: leaky sump plate
Message-ID: &lt;377AEEAC.7C60878E_at_jps_dot_net&gt;

Hey volks,
            I recently put a new oil temp sender in the sump plate of my
'78 Westy. I tried to seal the sump up well with Permatex 3H when I put
it back on. But the thing leaks oil very badly. Did I do something wrong
here? Isn't 3H a great oil sealant? Any suggestions? When I originally
got the rebuilt engine back from AVP, they seem to have used some type
of silicone to seal it effectively. I thought the Permatex would work
just as well.
