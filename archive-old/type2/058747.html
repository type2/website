Subject: VW Euro in Holland

hey folks,

VW Euro in Holland last weekend was as good as usual. We arrived on
Friday afternoon
and set up camp in a relatively empty campsite. By midnight it was
rammed full!

The swap meet came up with the usual level of rare goodies and was big!
I got hold of a NOS pickup ribbed bumper and irons! and barndoor
steering
wheel and hornpush, some early door handles, an accessory beetle
steering lock
(which cost me 5Fl (about £1.60) ) and various other bus bits which were
very
cheap.

The pickup went fine all the way (about 500 miles round trip) with its
new motor,
and the weather was pretty good most of the time. Plenty of UKers went
over on
the ferry which made it good.

Roll on next year,

just gotta bend my deluxe bumper trip round my pickup bumper now!

Lee.
