Subject: clock wiring, dashboard lighting

The clock in my 79 westy is not working.  Actually, it's been disconnected.
If someone has a schematic nearby, could you tell me the colour code(s) of
the wire(s)?

BTW I don't really care if the clock works or not, I'm just wanting to get
more dashboard lighting and I'm assuming the clock has a light built in?...
