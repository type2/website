Subject: Re: [T2] Adjusting flaps/thermostat when in a warm climate?

Adjust it at night per the bentley book and you'll be fine.  It really 
starts expanding around 100 degrees anyways, so I don't think it's 
really that big of a deal.

Now, if it's not compressing all the way, you might also have a bad 
thermostat...

&gt; Hi All:
&gt; 
&gt; Looking through the archives I see that there is lots of discussion on
&gt; thermostats. What I have not seen is any advice on adjusting the
&gt; thermostat when living in a warm climate. I live in South Florida
&gt; without the benefit of any cold nights, so the thermostat is never fully
&gt; compressed.
