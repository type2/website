Ralph Palmer asked re the lenghtways Split in NM....was it Mike Cathey's?
YES it was Mike Cathey's house! So you were the guys who we heard about from
Tom and Mike!
We did our grande tour of the Southwest and land of enchantment using ABQ as
our starting and finishing point! Mike lent us his house and Goofy bus while we
recovered from the shock of arriving in altitude and heat (and strange culture)
Such generous hospitality....all the Americans we actually met and chatted with
were so friendly and open.......when we returned after a month driving round
the R66 Splits threw a cookout / party for us at mikes...some very nice
Splitties and people
Did you get to check out Mike's Barndoor? He reckoned to have it on the road
soon (!) 
Other highlights included touring round ABQ and the Sandia Mts in a '53 Deluxe
with friendly local guides! 
Dave and Cee
