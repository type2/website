&gt; &gt; There's nothing in Cheyenne.

&gt; Nothing? :(
&gt; 
&gt; What's there to do in Estes Park without camping?
&gt; 

you can still camp.  there are plenty of campsites open year round.  the
national park camp sites are mostly open year round.  just bring your own
heat as it generally is much colder in estes park than down where we are.
the bear lake region of the national park is another 1000-1500 feet in
elevation above estes and gets even colder.

estes is a tourist town.  there's plenty of shopping and eating and crap
for the kids to do.

i am a huge proponant of our national park system.  get out and enjoy the
one in your backyard.  cheyenne is flat and windy.  you need to go west
from cheyenne to laramie and points beyond to get into the scenic parts
of wyoming.
