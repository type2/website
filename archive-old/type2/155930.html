Subject: Re: [T2] CHT - again

&gt;  Can anyone suggest
&gt; where the thermocouples could be stuck on the heads where they would
&gt; be no nuisance while covered with thermal insulation?  And what
&gt; insulation material would seem good?

I rather like the location of the CHT2 sensor for FI Type IV's. I
would assume a shop could drill and tap mates for that on all four
cylinders.

The location is out of the path of cooling air, you can cover it with
whatever you want, and it's where VW chose to get CHT readings.
