Subject: 78 Champagne Edition worth?

I love my bus. Period.

Baby on the way forces it's (possible)sale.....Gotta get the woman a car (she's
currently on a scooter) and she refuses to drive the bus.

Here's the goods:

1978 Champagne Edition Westfalia
Rebuilt engine and NEW transmission with less than 4000 miles, all work done by
Tassi in Daly City, California. (about $3500)
Interior in nearly perfect shape. That funky green/brown plaid fabric is in
very good shape.
Stove, sink pump, and refrigerator all works.
both tables there and in great shape. (both? yeah, the other one is between the
driver and passenger seat)
missing the elusive &quot;camping stool&quot;
Exterior was re-painted about three years ago, ivory up top, brown below.
couple of small scratches.

Custom modifications include:
three solar panels developing 160 watts mounted to pop-top.
two deep-cycle marine batteries and RV-style charging system.
VDO head temp sensor
CB Radio and Marine-style compass mounted on dash
40-watt am/fm/cd system, mounted in rear cabinet, controlled by remote.
Jerry-can holder mounted to rear hatch.
(Note: the solar panels charge the batteries, via the charge controller. These
batteries power the fridge, stereo, sink pump, and all interior lights. During
daytime, there's enough power generated by the panels to run the fridge and
still have enough left over to keep the batteries charged up. Power inverter
present for on-demand 120VAC power. No need to worry about discharging your
engine battery when camping. Original A/C charging system in place, but not
hooked up. All original wiring still in place, can easily be gone back to.)

The bad part? the previous owner removed the fold-out part of the upper bunk
(still have it and the hinges!) and built a face to cover the opening. The
cover for the large upper mattress is missing. Carpet in back is a little
stained. Rear defroster not hooked up. that's it!

Overall mileage, 154,000

The Bus and myself are located in San Francisco.

Can anyone give me any guidance on what Pooh would be worth? I know it's all
subjective. It's worth about a million to me :)

Thanks for all your time.
