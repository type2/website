If you can't hold on to your dipstick (the one in your car) then it is too

.  Some
&gt; people say it should not go over 180. Some say 220.  Others say 260.
During
&gt; summer in Florida my temp is regularly at 220 around town and as high as
&gt; 240-250 on the highway. What is an
&gt; &gt; acceptable temp and where do I pull off the road and let her cool down.
&gt; I'm
&gt; &gt; planning a trip to the rockies in a few weeks and an oil temp gauge was
&gt; &gt; suggested. Just took a trip to the store and back and it just topped
220F.
