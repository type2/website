Subject: Re: [T2] Optima batteries for starting

Hi Mark &amp; List,

I'm running a Yellow Top Optima in my '71 Westy, I got
it because I thought it'd be good for camping, and I'd
had one too many &quot;accidents&quot; with spilling acid from
lugging numerous old style batteries in and out to
carry 'em into the house to recharge - I park on the
street (if you don't recall my recent posts!) If I
didn't drive my bus for a few days it'd be much harder
to start in cold weather, even though I have the 2nd
&quot;direct&quot; solenoid setup. I have an alternator
conversion in my bus.

I was originally planning to get another Optima, a Red
Top, and run 2 batteries, with Hella's relay kit I'd
seen, but one Yellow Top has been great, it has
massive power reserves. Plus, I could fish it in and
out without ever risking a spill, but it's been in
there since May when I got it, no need to pull it to
recharge, it keeps a charge really well!!

So, they cost top dollar, but are all these things
you'll have to consider, if the benefits are worth it
to you..

Is anyone running a Red and a Yellow, with the relay
(or isolator) as I'd be interested if they can be
mixed?? Red for starting, and Yellow for camping??

FYI, I bought my Yellow locally, but you can get these
shipped, so it's worth searching for a good deal on
line..
