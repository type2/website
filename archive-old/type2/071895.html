Dear Folks,

  I find that a friends gift is half of a Stewart-Warner Southwind heater.  I 
seem to be missing the combustion air blower, coil, and breaker points, which I 
assume was one unit.  I did find a good web page on these heaters at: 
        
http://www.fament_dot_com/chip/vw/heat/page1.html

It has some nice scans of a manual with lots of technical data.  I couldn't find
a name on the page, but if you're on the list, nice job.

So where do I get parts?  What I need, I guess, is more than parts. Any ideas?
