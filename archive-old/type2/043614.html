Subject: spark plug order on the distributer

Hi,
My wife tried her first tune up and now the bus wont start.  I think the
wires are in the wrong order on the distributor.  On a '78 type IV
engine, the four distributor post are driver front, passenger front,
driver rear, passenger rear.  four plugs, driver front, passenger front,
driver rear passenger rear.  Which plug goes to which post?
