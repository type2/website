Subject: first big trip! (long-ish)

My wife and I took Busosaurus on our first big road-trip, a 1000 mile plus
mountain trek through the Kootenays of British Columbia.  Before we headed
out I replaced the steering damper, front shocks and got the HEAT
operational before leaving (what luxuries!) but he was making terrible
mileage in spite of a pre-trip tune-up (3500 mile overhauled 2.0 fuel
injected).  While on a stopover in Abbotsford, prior to heading east, I
found that the little boot on the Auxiliary Air Regulator was cracked but a
dab of silicone and a jubilee clamp fixed the leak (thanks again to the
Bartno-Teck web-page!).  After this fix the cylinder head temp (CHT) rose an
average of 40 degrees F for highway cruising (confirming a leaner mixture),
ranging between 340 and 350 degrees F during 55mph highway cruising.  The
highest that the CHT got was 365 F during a prolonged climb over a 5600 foot
mountain pass. For the mountain running I ran premium fuel, treated with
synthetic 2-stroke-cycle oil at a 300:1 mix.  Fuel consumption for the rest
of the trip averaged 18.5 miles per US gallon, with one consumption reading
a high 22 mpg, but we must have been going down hill that day :)  The only
other gremlins on our trip was an intermittent gas gauge, and the horn
stopped working for a day in protest of use from my bleating away in the
tunnels by Hell's Gate ;)  The Hi-Top gave us an uncomfortable ride in heavy
cross wind conditions, even with the improvement of my new steering damper
(Busosaurus' steering is still a bit loose) but we weren't in a hurry and
simply slowed down some more.  The only other bay-window that I saw on the
road east of Chilliwack was a west-bound T2 Hi-Top that we passed on Highway
3 somewhere near Hedley.  Everyone we met was very friendly and Busosaurus
brought a lot of smiles and waves, warts and all.  Overall, we had a great
trip, we're already planning the next one!

Cheers,
