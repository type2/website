Subject: Re: [T2] Paint question...

60 or 80 grit for stripping.


&gt;Chris;
&gt;    DOH! I have a variety of random orbit sanders. I build custom 
&gt; furniture for
&gt;a living. Guess my brain was not engaged. What type/grit of sanding discs do
&gt;you recommend?
&gt;Art

Like anything else work towards finer grits for primering.

Don't bother trying to work the body with powertools (unless you are better 
than I and that is almost certain...). Strip it down. Block sand it. Primer 
it. Block it.


Ciao!
