Subject: Re: [T2] Wheel bearings


Uhh, I guess I meant &quot;hubs&quot; instead of spindles on the previous post.

It's been a long day folks....

Cheers ,dave

&gt; Wow,thanks for the fast replies on the mexican hatch seal. Rob is going 
&gt; to let me check it out first hand. Nothing better that seeing with my 
&gt; own eyes. Now another quick question while I have everyone's attention. 
&gt; It's getting real close to leaving for everybus and I am starting to get
&gt; a little nervous. I put a rebuilt engine in,all new 
&gt; hoses,injectors,heater boxes,exhuast and it's running real good. I am 
&gt; going to check the brakes and bearing this weekend and replace the 
&gt; rubber hoses. I also want to flush out all the brake fluid. My question 
&gt; is on the bearings. I have new seals and plan on regreasing them. I've 
&gt; never done it on a bus before and would like some suggestion on how. 
&gt; Also do I have to replace the front bearings if I replace the front 
&gt; rotors?( I do have a Bentley but I left at work).
