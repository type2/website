Thanks to everyone who gave me advice on transmission support yesterday.  I am happy to announce that after a bit of excitement, my 78 gave birth to a somewhat healthy type IV late last night.  The transmission is currently being supported by an extra jack just in case and as far as I can tell, nothing was bent or damaged in the process.  I will definetely remove the engine and transmission as a unit next time.  In fact, I am planning on removing the transmission and reinstalling everything together.  This will be my first Type IV rebuild so Im sure you will be hearing from me again in the near future.  Thanks again!
