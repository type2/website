I would suggest  a motorcycle shop... they have been &quot;welding&quot; plastic and
composite body materials for years now,,
You should be able to have it welded fairly easily,,

-----Original Message-----Brian Hoare -

&gt;I had a crack at the threaded bottom of my water tank. I tried a number of
&gt;list member suggestions, but none would hold with enough strength when I
&gt;threaded the water pump back into my tank. I tried super glue, JB-weld, and
&gt;a Loctite product. &gt;
