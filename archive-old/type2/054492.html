&gt; I just picked up my new clutch/pressure plate and release bearing. I have 
&gt; them all installed already but have one question about the pressure plate. I 
&gt; don't have a torque wrench and was wondering if I can manage tightening this 
&gt; plate without one. I think the spec is 18ft lbs and I have all the bolts as 
&gt; tight as I can get them.

Wow!  I hope you're a wimp!  18 ft-lbs isn't all that much, but since you
are working on steel threads you probably didn't hurt anything.
