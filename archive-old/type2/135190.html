Give Always V-Dub a call. I bought a new genuine VW windshield from them 
last summer. They had quite a few of them then. They installed it for around 
$180 with my own seal.

&gt; Name? Location?
&gt; I just did my own 3 months ago and I live in Portland.  I didn't get off
&gt; that cheap though and all I paid was cost of parts.  Who is this masked 
&gt; man?
&gt; I can never have enough resources for such miraculous things!
