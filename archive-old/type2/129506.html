Subject: Re: [T2] California BUS

The original emissions stuff on my old bus, 1971, were PCV and a fuel 
tank evaporative emissions activated charcoal filter thing. No EGR.

As a sidebar issue -- does anyone know how much emissions a stock 1971 
bus w/ the above, would have had?

NOx, CO, and HC, when compared against, say, a new Honda sedan,  a Ford 
Expedition intimidation vehicle, an H2 penis enlargement device, all 
Cali style.

&gt;&gt;How does the smog test laws affect us in California?
&gt;&gt;I don`t think that  my 71 bus has any smog equipment anyway.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;IIRC, 71 vehicles had PCV and EGR. Air injection didn't come along until 73? 
&gt;
&gt;Can anybody confirm this? It's been a while since I had to worry about
&gt;smogging older vehicles...
