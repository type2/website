Subject: T2 Combi to a Camper

Dear all,

I'm in a project to transform a T2 1972 Kombi to
Westy. Does it possible to be done for myself?

When I bought, the T2, two weeks ago, it comes without
an engine, now I have a 2.0 T4 carbs engine, totally
dismounted, and I would like to know:

a) Does it possible to convert it in a injection eng.?

b) It has a CU code with no more number. Is it an
after market product, a spare, per instance?
C) Does it fit in 1972, T2? If yes how kind of
concerns I suppose to take care?

Thanks

Lima (Portugal-Europe)
