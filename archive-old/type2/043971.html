No, my GEX engine self-destructed and I stripped it down to the long block
for return.  This was well after the 12,000 mile/12 month warranty expired;
the heat sensor was just fine.

&gt; &gt;There is a small dime sized metal heat sensor on the case of the engine
that
&gt; &gt;either gets a hole in the middle or falls off if the engine is
overheated.
&gt; &gt;GEX will use this as evidence that you incorrectly installed the engine
&gt; &gt;causing it to overheat and fail, so you need pictures of a properly
&gt; &gt;installed engine to back up your claim.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  I was speaking to a VW mechanic friend of mine only recently about
&gt;  the metal heat sensors and their use to claim an engine has been
&gt;  overheated by dubious commercial engine builders.
&gt;
&gt;  He said that an air-cooled engine will generally run hot enough during
&gt;  normal use with all cooling tin etc. in place to melt off the heat
&gt;  sensors anyway.
&gt;  Sounds like just a slimy way to void the warranty of any engine when
&gt;  it fails after a short service life.
&gt;
&gt;  But I confess no first hand experience here,it's just what I've been
&gt;  told...
