i borrowed a compressor and a welder today from a friend -  a friend of
a friend who happens to be a 20 year body man came over - we seperated
the roof skin from the roof section and kept the roof supports attacted
- drilling out the welds would have meant too many holes in the new
section - we cut the section at just the point were it turns flat into
the roof gutter - the welding in the rain gutter of the new section was
much too eratic - spots and edges etc. - it was almost continuous - and
there were some spot welds in the nominally vertical section and we
drilled those out - i was left with a roof section with brackets
attacted and the horizontal section that goes into the rain gutter
removed and in the edge right above the rain gutter has a series of
holes drilled all along it
we cut the roof section in the middle of my bus from about 1&quot; above the
rain gutter to the internal supports - we removed both internal
supports...(sniip)

wow- sounds like a lot of work- hooray for you,  yup, usually repairs dont
come out perfect, but it sounds like itll be pretty nice, and in any case a
ton better than it was.     Hey me and Chris painted and did some bodywork to
my Westy and it is not perfect by anymeans, and i learned a LOT about bodywork
and paint too, and could do it better, but it looks decent, and a ton better
than it was- people dont recognise it.

BTW, there is a cool tool for drilling out spot welds where it is a circle,
and after cutting around the spot weld  a spring loaded point pushes away the
other piece of metal- ive used it and it works really well, you have to groind
down the spot weld circle left, but easier than filling holes and also quicker
than drilling straight through the spot weld.
