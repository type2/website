Subject: Re: [T2] What kind of Jacks/Stands to Buy

&gt; I want to buy some jack and stands for my bus.  I currently own no jacks or
&gt; stands.
&gt; 
&gt; What I need is Jacks that will allow me to do all repair and maintenance on
&gt; my bus, including any engine or brake work.  Obviously, safety is a factor,
&gt; so I want jacks &amp; jack stands that will let me work under the bus without
&gt; fear of the house falling down.

good idea,   I suggest if you can

a floor type hydraulic jack that will lift 21 inches, these are sometimes
called SUV jacks, I have seen decent ones for $75 or so.  using the
smaller ones means you have to jack it all the way up, put a jack stand
in, lower the jack and put it on some wood blocks and then raise the bus
some more, especially in the rear there is a lot of travel in the
suspension.
  jack stands should be heavy metal and rated at an absolute minimum of
2.5tons, (5tons is better) While two of them is all you need, I have found
a third one to be very handy at times, these are cheap insurance get good
ones with a nice deep saddle on the top.

good luck
Bob

&gt; 
&gt; Can someone please advise what I require in terms of jacks / stands.  Also
&gt; appreciated would be a description of minimum and maximum requirements.
&gt; For example, perhaps a suggested starter kit to get me off and going, then
&gt; the 'good-to-have' additions that can follow later, if req'd.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for the continued support.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards.
