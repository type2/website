Subject: 1981 high idle problem

I have a recently rebuilt Vanagon. With the rebuild I replaced almost all
items. However after emissions testing came up in march and I flunked then had
to replace my CAT to get through (CAT was fried after only 2 yrs in service) I
realized I need to address this issue.

So I found 3 vacuum leaks and repaired them (in the engine compartment). I now
have all brass elbows and Ys in the engine compartment. No more cracked rubber
elbows etc... the engine is running allot smoother now. However the issue
still remains

So at cold engine start in the morning I have the idle adjusted low (about 700
rpm) after it warms up it reaches about 1000 rpm and will back down to about
900 rpm at stop lights in traffic. But after about 30 minutes when the engine
is HOT it gets up too about 1500 rpm and WILL NOT back down when I am in
traffic at lights.

Is this some other issue ?

I have begun testing procedures as outlined in Bentley, all 4 injectors test
out within spec at the ECU plug ( I unplug the ECU and test via the terminals
in the plug). Could this be the deceleration valve or the temp sensor on the
head ???

Or maybe the ECU ???

I have a new AFM as of 2 yrs ago, engine less than 8000 miles on it, new
injectors (everything is as of 2 yrs ago when it was rebuilt), new air valve,
new cold start injector, I plated over the (after removing) EGR valve about 6
months ago and that did seem to make the engine run better.
