Rimco will do all your machining with a touch of excellence.  I've used
their services for many years and have been very happy with their quality.

Nice score on the heads John!  I'm curious about the PN of the valves. My
'81 IMC book shows 021-109-611(022-109-612D) as the 1700cc sodium exhaust
valve. My cost back then...$19.95 LOL!

Forgive my ignorance, what's a plate kit?. T4 only?

&gt;Can you tell us more about your oil cooler fan solution Jake?  I don't know
&gt;the setup but it sounds &quot;cool&quot;.  Are sodium valves still available and if
so
&gt;are they advisable?

Sodium valves are patchily available.  A lot of guys swear they are old tech
and not worth using, and I'm even talking like Bob Donalds here.  BUT you
know something VW was still putting sodium valves in '91 WATERBOXERS,
so you be the judge.  I got a deal ($26 each) on some for the 1.7/2.0 bus
from
GPR a few years back and I think some others did as well, but recently when
I called they were NLA (from them at least.)  Automotion still lists them
for
the 1700 and 2.0 914 I think but they are pricey (and always were from them
$60 each or so.)  I recall Bob Hoover tracking down a set to use in a T4 he
was doing FWIW.  The 1800 should be the same valve as the waterboxer
incidently I guess, but I think those were NLA from the dealer as of about
5 years ago.  Regardless I don't think they are past technology I think they
are just expensive and hard to find, a lot of racer types still run them
regularly.  An interesting tidbit here is that a NOS set of 1700 heads I
bought off of ebay came with sodium valves that don't have the little hole.
I don't KNOW they are sodium but they are VW valves, the guy claimed he
paid more in the day for them and had a pcopy of the VW parts list that
showed them to be so and the PN was correct (a one of a kind PN BTW.)
