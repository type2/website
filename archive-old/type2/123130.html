Subject: Re: [T2] Gas Heaters (Was: 72 bus and 412 motor)

wow Ron writes this up real great, to add a few addenda to his comments
besides having a BA-4 in my bus I actually owned a new 74-412 way back
when...

&gt; &gt; The heater boxes from a 412 are very weak compared to 
&gt; &gt; those used on a bus. They will fit, but they don't produce
&gt; 
&gt; 411's and 412's came with Eberspacher BA4 gas heaters (or boosters, as
&gt; they were correctly called, as - unlike the Southwind/Stewart Warner
&gt; heaters they were designed to augment, not replace, the heater boxes).
&gt; 
&gt; But, if you have access to a 411 or 412, it may still have its BA4 gas
&gt; heater (well hidden under the car's rear deck area as I recall). Grab it

you actually have to take part of the rear suspension off to get it out.
it sits right above the transmission

&gt; You will still want to use real Bus '72-74 heat exchangers, as the
&gt; &quot;mickey mouse&quot; ones on a 411/412 are insufficient for a bus even with
&gt; the BA4 installed. And you may want to put a bilge blower before the BA4

personally I have only the BA-4 in my bus and have totally removed the
stock heat

&gt; to substitute for the blower that the BA4 lacks (but the BA6 has). Note,
&gt; do NOT put it after the BA4, as it may melt from the heat of the BA4;

been there done that.

&gt; and don't get too high powered a fan or it may move the air through the
&gt; furnace too quickly to heat sufficiently.  Even with an aux fan the
&gt; BA4's a bit too low-output for a Bus, but it ain't bad, and maybe down
&gt; the road you'll find a BA6 body to put in its place.

I don't know, I think mine is more than sufficient, BUT I also recirculate
the air from inside the bus,  but at 5 below in a wind in Northern Vermont
going to Killington and I was driving in shirt sleeves.

&gt; One note  The BA4 and 6 consist of a large number of components, some of
&gt; which are in the dash, under the vehicle near the front, etc. (not to
&gt; mention the wiring harness that goes front to back). In other words,

and how, one thing that helps is to cut any of the wires near the
component but leave a few inches so you can retain the color code. the
hardest part to find is the termostat which is inside the side sill
(drivers side) and isn't very large.

&gt; pages include a complete Eberspacher BA4 service manual (courtesy of
&gt; yours-truly)

thank you it is a great help

&gt; It's a big job to install a BA4/6 in a bus from scratch, but it's a
&gt; magnificently designed system - very effective 

yes it is a lot of work, mine was even more so  since it was designed
differently than stock (more later)

&gt; so hard to install; many parts) - but cautious engineering is a good
&gt; thing when you're driving around with a highly combustable furnace
&gt; mounted under your bus.

I always shut mine down a few minutes before fueling the bus

&gt; side of caution (if working properly), with a safety switch that shuts
&gt; it off if there's no flame to prevent accumulation of explosive fumes.
&gt; This means that it's more likely to trip the circuit breaker

I also added two switches to mine so I can override the safety switches
and manually shut down the fuel pump and the master power for the heater.

&gt; heater is not a place to cut corners. Take the time to ensure all of the
&gt; parts work correctly, and remember that you're dealing with used parts.

check and double check, it is harder to get it working wrong than right.

My heater is mounted under the front of the bus where the air conditioner
condenser was formally mounted.   I use the air conditioner blower to take
air in under the dashboard blowing the air thru the heater which is
mounted transversely under the van, the heat output is directed into the
regular heat duct right behind the front axle beam.  I used truck flex
exhaust pipe for the ducting (make sure you get the stainless pipe, AMHIK)

take care and enjoy the heat
