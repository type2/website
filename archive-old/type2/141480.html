Subject: Re: [T2] bending brake lines

&gt; You should have bought them locally with the right metric ends on them.

not necessary

&gt; I don't know what Ronnie is selling but at most local FLAPs there is
&gt; such a thing a flexible brake lines which will take bend and be able to
&gt; relax again if needed.
&gt;
&gt; Hope this isn't another one of his Genuine, Made in Taiwan, Germany
&gt; parts offerings.
&gt;
&gt; Looks like you may be doomed here.


I think  Terry &lt;chicken little&gt; K  has misunderstood your question... he 
couldn't possibly think a thing like [un]bending a steel line will DOOM you 
into Purgatory
Or,, of course then the coil of steel line the sell would have to be used 
for round and half round shaped lines only... never to be straightened out 
again.

Steel lines are malleable,, they bend easily,,, yes,, they will kink if not 
careful !

The easiest way to bend,,, or maybe better put as: straighten that line the 
Bus Depot sells.. is to put it flat on the floor ,, foot on the one end,, 
with the bend going verticlal.. and roll the other end into the floor 
following the bend with the pressure on the push.

This is very easy to do.. not as easy to describe I guess.... I have always 
bent my own lines from a 25' roll of tube.. nothing more than my hands up to 
3/8&quot;
and installed the ends my self with a flare tool.

electricians bend EMT conduit all the time.. and not alway with the correct 
tool ...
Most electricians have a &quot;bender&quot; that fits the &quot;tube&quot; ,,, but if they want 
a fancy bend for light fixture instead of just a wire way fastened to the 
wall,, they will want a big swoooping bend... so.. you take the spare tire 
from your truck.. and roll the conduit around it.
if you over bend it ,, you can bend it back and try again... without tooo 
much ripple effect in the wall.

Fabricators use thin wall tube for things they are building.. like hand 
railings on a spiral stair....  very easy to bend around something like a 
tire of the right diameter with a little ingenuity.

The tool might be just great for that specific 90 deg bend you might want,, 
and your hands can do the same job and can even make a whoop,, or  a dee doo 
or when you get a little better at it,, you will make a whoop dee doo all at 
once!
:-)

Now.. I did a google search.. as this is a pretty standard practise that any 
mechanic with any training at all would know how to do.. as it is MUCH 
cheaper to stock a roll of line and install your own ends............

1. How do we ship the long fuel and brake lines?
We ship the line in an oversize box approximately 9&quot;x19&quot;x79&quot; (the largest 
allowable by UPS) with a shipping bend in the center section. This shipping 
bend is easily removed by placing the line on the floor, holding one end 
against the floor and pressing your hand slowly along the bend to straighten 
it out. No need to use tools.
