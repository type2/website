Subject: Bracket for a/c compressor

Hi everyone- as it gets hotter and hotter hear in NJ I am sooo wishing
that I had fixed the a/c in my bus when it broke last year!  It was
working fine, VERY nice and cold (at least on me, the driver, where it
was important!) when the belt broke.  Apparently there are some brackets
on the outside of the compressor that hold the belt in place and one of
these is broken so the belt keeps breaking or popping off. (This is the
second time the belt went)  The compressor itself is ok, but does anyone
know if it is possible to just get the housing for the compressor with
good brakets or do I just shell out the $$ for a new compressor?  I
know, I should just tough it out without a/c but I sweat like a pig and
my kids are screaming in the backseat, blah, blah, blah.....Thanks for
any info!  Love, Beth and Prudence the 78 Bus
