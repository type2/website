Subject: Re: [T2] Help finding a short!

Excellent points Tom

like you said ,,sometimes the switches actually short against the dash itself...
and doing what
you suggest will eliminate that !
I would use heat shrink instead of black tape for longevity due to heat goooing
the black tape

Jamie Rivers

&gt; Disconnect your battery.

&gt; Drop the switches down below the dash.

&gt;  give it a good cleaning(after making a diagram of the colour
&gt; codes to what terminals.)

&gt; After you're done with that, take some black electrical tape and go around
&gt; the outside of the wire group on each switch with a loop, which will help
&gt; eliminate them shorting to the dash and other wires.
