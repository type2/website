Volks,
   I have question. Firt I have a 79 2.0L, FI, Calif Smog. I need to replace
the oil cooler seals as I believe they are leaking. I was wondering how hard
this job will be if I keep the motor in the bus. If anybody has done this
and/or anybody knows any tricks to make this job easier. Any information
will be greatly appreciated.
