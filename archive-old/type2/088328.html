Subject: RE: [T2] Thermostat- to fit or not to fit? Failure Mode



&gt; All major name aircooled engines are equipped with thermostats
&gt; designed to fail with the flaps OPEN.

I disagree completely. The whole reason people got in the habit of
removing them was because of failing closed. The flaps on a T1 are
opened by the engine heating up a small bellows which causes the air
inside the bellows to expand which increases the length and pushes the
flaps open. The problem is when the bellows gets a hole they can no
longer expand and the flaps stay closed.

What are the chances of the bellows failing may be debatable. Is it a
real concern or an unnecessary worry? When VWs were in their heyday they
were so cheap that people didn't install temp gages they just drove
them. Here in the Sacramento valley temperatures are never very cold so
people removed them &quot;just in case&quot;.
 
I don't agree with removing them but this is why people did and still
do.
