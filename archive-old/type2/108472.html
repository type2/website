&gt; ... we drove one home from the shore (beach to you non-NJ-types) with a
broken crank...

With a broken crank?  Did you know it was broken before/during the drive?

Many, many years ago, I broke a Vega down to replace a head gasket, and
discovered that the shaft holding the valve tappets was broken in two.
Somehow, the shaft had broken where it passed through one of the supports.
With the break exactly centered in the support.  No debris or scoring, just
the break.

Since there wasn't any other obvious damage to the rest of the engine, in
spite of the shaft's diameter and the rather impressive broken ends that
mated so perfectly, I carefully re-installed the shaft and continued to
drive the vehicle until it died one day from other causes on a jaunt from
Indiana to Pennsylvania.

It was just weird to see the shaft pop up on one end before the other end
was loosened up, sorta like being in an old Three Stooges episode.
