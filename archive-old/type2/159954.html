 That is the gasket that seals the engine tin to the
 top of the oil
 cooler ('77 FI).  It's freakin' Unobtainum.  Either
 nobody has it, or
 they haven't even heard of it.  
 
 Crap!!!
 
 That is one of the first pieces of tin that gets
 installed, so I'm held
 up on re-assembly because of it.  And I'm seriously
 itching to get this
 motor back into the bus.  It's been nearly 2 months
 now, and I'm almost
 waiting as long on parts as I had to wait for the
 money to buy them!
 Now that I finally have 99% of what I need, I can't
 find the freakin'
 seal!!!!  
 
 Thoughts?
