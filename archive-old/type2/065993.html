Helmut Zeidler has kindly forwarded interesting detail on engine
conversions, which I am posting to the list at his request.  It
sounds like the kit is expensive but well-thought-out.  You have
to envy the Germans for having enough Vanagons to make the kit a
worthwhile business.  I will post further information as I get
it; hope others will do the same.  Also please some feedback
from the Type2 list about whether this should be double-posted
(as I've done with this item) or just to the wet list.
 
 
 
The conversion kits AUDI 5 Cyl./Ford V6 are available from:
 
 
 
     Axel Winkler
 
     Schuechtermannstr. 7
 
     D-44628 Herne
 
 
 
     Phone +49 2323 8444
 
     FAX   +49 2323 82374
 
 
 
Presently the garage is closed for holidays but they will start
next Monday.  Try to send a FAX, I am sure that the staff has
only thin knowledge in English language. There are Axel Winkler,
the technician, salesman Chris Roseman, secretary Ulrike Winkler
and Dieter Komorowski, responsible for shipping. You may mail 30
Deutsch Marks to the account *Dresdner Bank Herne-Sued*, Account
No. 7651715, BLZ 360 800 80 and you will receive a 180 page
catalogue with a lot of pictures, parts lists of their kits and
short descriptions what have to be done for that engine swap.
Sorry, but the catalogue is only available in German language,
but don*t worry, the pictures will tell you the most.
 
Here are some AUDI and Ford engines you may use for the
conversion kits:
 
Ford V6  2.0 Liter   66 kW (90 PS)  145 km/h      DM  2,450.00
 
Ford V6  2.3 Liter   84 kW (114 PS) 151 km/h      DM  3,290.00
 
                          same with Catalyst      DM  4,200.00
 
     same for automatic transmission systems      DM  2,800.00
 
Ford V6  2.8 Liter  103 kW (145 PS)               DM  4,950.00
 
Ford V6  2.9 Liter  112 kW (150 PS)               DM  4,500.00
 
Ford V6  2.9 Liter 24V     (196 PS) engine incl.  DM 11,000.00
 
                   4 disc brakes recommended      DM  3,600.00
 
AUDI 5 Cyl. 2.2 Liter            100 kW (136 PS)  DM  2,750.00
 
      AUDI 5 Cyl. 2.2 Liter Turbo (170 PS) is the same engine!
 
AUDI 5 Cyl. Diesel                51 kW  (70 PS)  DM  2,850.00
 
AUDI 5 Cyl. 2.5 Liter TDI Diesel  85 kW (115 PS)  DM  3,490.00
 
AUDI 5 Cyl. 2.5 Liter TDI Diesel 102 kW (140 PS)  DM  3,490.00
 
VW T4 2.4 Liter                          (78 PS)  DM  2,850.00
 
The maximum speed limit is mostly limited in maximum engine
rotation and transmission's rate.
 
 
 
My own story:
 
 
 
The engine of my 2 liter air-cooled vanagon from the *80`s broke
down and that was the start to install an AUDI 5 Cylinder with
100 kW (136 PS). You also may take that 170 PS Turbo model. I
got an `82 AUDI 200 wreck by nearly no payment and 200,000 km on
the clock, but a well-conditioned engine. You may use most of
the front part including electric, starter and co., the mounts
supporting the engine and some ducts. I bought the assembling
kit from Winkler which costs 2,750 Deutsch Marks without
shipping. I received:
 
1 clutch housing (I don*t know, if it is from a Volvo or the VW
light truck LT 35)
 
1 special machined clutch disk for 240 mm flywheels
 
1 adapter with ball bearing to mate the VW transmission shaft
 
1 engine support, a huge tube from left to right frame rail,
going below the engine
 
1 complete exhaust system without catalyst (which is not yet
needed in Germany)
 
1 set of some smaller parts
 
 
 
What you will need additionally is the 240 mm flywheel itself
and its pressure plate, both parts of an AUDI Quattro. That will
cost about 600 Deutsch Marks. Some other parts will help you to
fit the engine into the vanagon. There are the air cleaner box
and rubber ducts for fresh air used in an AUDI 80 or Rabbit. I
also installed the automatic accelerator from the AUDI 200, easy
to do, nothing secret.
 
It is recommended to use the long transmission boxes from the
high powered Vanagons like those 4 or 5 speed ones from the 2L
engines. It is possible, but please do not use the lowpowered
Diesel transmission system. Another solution will be the Porsche
transmission, but this is not tested.
 
For me and my ill equipped garage it took two weeks to
reassemble the engines from AUDI and the vanagon and to put the
5 Cylinder in. The shipped exhaust system will find its place
underneath the left midsection. Because my vanagon is a camper
and on that place you will find a 50 liter water reservoir, I
try to use the original AUDI exhaust system. There have been a
lot of plumbing, but it fit into the center of the midsection
and the pipe will end on the Vanagons south east corner. This is
the stage I am working at present. In Germany we have to weld
some parts like the new support for the front transmission mount
and square holes for the engine support, which altogether allows
a 3 cm lowered engine. In this case you have to raise the
decklid by only 4 cm. Without lowering, it will be possible to
mount everything without welding.

I would be interested in hearing details of price and exactly
what components are included in the conversion kits. I own an 81
Vanagon with a 78 Porsche six, but if I get a newer, watercooled
Vanagon I would only consider watercooled engines for the
conversion.
 
 
 
I am confident that many on the Type2 and especially the Vanagon
list would be interested in knowing the details.  Thanks for
your offer.
