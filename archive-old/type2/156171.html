Subject: Re: [T2] attaching wire to distributor points' plate

&gt; I'm entering new territory, for me at least.
&gt; I'm disassembling a stock distributor to learn more about how it
&gt; works and how to restore it.  The points' plate is grounded to the
&gt; distributor body via a short braided wire.
&gt; How does one reattach this wire at either end. The last time I tried
&gt;  to solder to steel, I had no success.

you can also drill and tap a tiny hole and put a tiny screw in the breaker
plate to attach the wire
