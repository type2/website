Hello.

DB &amp; HVWs ran an article in March '93 about making the 34 PICT3 work. I
believe you can order reprints from them.

As they put it:

&quot;The Solex 34 PICT-3 is a good carburetor, although it was one designed
to work with a stock 1600cc engine with 100% original equipment. If you
make any chenges to the engine combination, such as ignition timing,
bore size, cam or exhaust, you can plan on making this carburator one
unhappy camper.&quot;

My experience finds this to be true -- I HATE the 34!!!!!!!!!!

What's a VW with four blondes in it???

&gt; &gt;The 009 is worthless with the 34PICT3 carb unless you rework the carb
&gt; &gt;completely. The carb is jetted too lean for the advance curve of the
&gt; &gt;009. If you run 40 with an 009 and a 34 you won't keep your new engine
&gt; &gt;to long unless you have done some serious jetting research; IMHO ;&gt;)
&gt; 
&gt; Sheez, is that why mine bogs so? I can either have detonation at speed, or
&gt; a non-responsive throttle, whichever I like. ;) The difference is about 1
&gt; degree, but it's definitely an either/or adjustment. I knew the 009 wasn't
&gt; optimal for the Bus but I thought it had a lot to do with the fact that I'm
&gt; running a K&amp;N, so the carb can't suck hot air. Maybe not?
&gt; 
&gt; It does run cool, though, I have to really wail it to make the dipstick
&gt; warm. Advise me.
