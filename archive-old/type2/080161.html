Subject: pre-lubed for easier starting...

Instead of snake oil, what about a VW FI pump for pre-oiling the engine prior
to start up? 30 lbs. pressure, check valve to prevent the oil from 
reversing...
Wired through the dash, a couple seconds of power and you've got about 30
PSI oil lubing everything so the engine never has to start &quot;dry&quot;.
 Plumbing shouldn't be that difficult to fab together...Any thoughts, Jake?
Anyone else? Cheaper than Accusump.
