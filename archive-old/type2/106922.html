Subject: Re: [T2] Tin Snip question

&gt; &gt; I want to go to my local Junk Yard to get some body pannels.  Can anyone
&gt; &gt; recomend some portable cutters to remove bits.  Thinks of wheel well parts
&gt; &gt; rear corners, pedistals.


Think air chisel with out the air,,,  hatchet and hammer.
I have an all steel hatchet, and a nice size ball peen hammer to beat on it.
Keep the hatchet sharp and you'll be surprised how easy and fast you can zip a
panel off.
A lot like a can opener.
