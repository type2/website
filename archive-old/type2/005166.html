UK listees ( I know there are some), as we have no fuel available on a
nationwide basis, does anyone know about VANFEST exhibitor attendances this
weekend?
Haven't tried just Kampers web site, but it seems many won't be going as no
petrol/diesel available.  We are trying to decide if it's worth the trip if
no stall holders will be there.

Sorry about this US listees, but you don't know how lucky you are!  Thanks
for your tolerance of this parochial enquiry.

                            Regards, Robert.
