Subject: Re: [T2] 74 vs. 75

[...]

&gt; I keep running into 'issues' concerning my bus when I try to order parts.
&gt; My bus is a '74 with a 1.8l engine. The exhaust is the type that are
&gt; normally seen on 75-79: elbows come lower and require tin with the big
&gt; groove and the muffler connects with single ports instead of dual. Does
&gt; this mean I really need to order parts for a '75? Or do I need to just
&gt; make sure everyone concerned knows it's '74 with a 1.8l?

You need 75-78 exhaust parts. Not 79. 72 to 74 is one style. 75 to 78 is your
style. 79 Fed resembles 72-74 but the ports are square. 79 Cal right side is
79 Fed. 79 Cal left side is one yesr only.

&gt; Also, it has a webber prog carb. Did the '74 1.8l come standard with dual
&gt; carbs or FI?

74 with manual trans came with dual carbs. Only 74 Calif with auto trans came
with FI.

&gt; My right-side head has the ports for the EGR (I assume that's
&gt; what they are) - which have come unplugged and I still haven't managed to
&gt; plug them correctly.

No, those ports are NOT EGR. They are air injection ports. If you had the
original manifolds, then you would have EGR diaphragms in each manifold.

EGR = exhaust gas recirculation. Inert exhaust gas comes from the exhaust and
enters the intake stream after the throttle plate.
The purpose is to lower combustion temps to stop the formation of oxides of
nitrogen [NOx].

Air injection = fresh air in pumped [or pulsed] in the exhaust system just
past the exhaust valves. The purpose is to complete the burn of the exhaust to
lower carbon monoxide.
