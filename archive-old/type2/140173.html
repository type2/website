Subject: RE: [T2] Alternator cooling boot

I still have not gotten back to this issue.  My weekend start tomorrow and I
plan on getting this resolved...or at least get a better understanding of
what's going wrong or what I am doing wrong.  I'll post my findings this
weekend hopefully.

But I am still trying to figure on how the repro
cannot be fitting, because if Troy had a very early T4 shroud, the new repro
boot would be too tight, not too loose.
