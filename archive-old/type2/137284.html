Subject: Re: [T2] Too many questions?

TR, if you don't like the questions, then delete them. What we have here is
a wannabee list cop, we don't need any. Mark has been here for years as have
I. I'm a list junkie too. If you can't handle it , disappear. Who needs your
negative opinions? 

Mark, ask more questions!!!
