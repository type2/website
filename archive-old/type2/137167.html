Subject: Re: [T2] Another list member?

In all honesty, the people here in Denver drive quite fast.  We have 
been out here since March from California and let me tell you, 
California was nothing.  I have also never seen so many people run red 
lights.  I have seen everything from a beat up Celica to a school bus 
and FedEx truck run red lights out here with no regard.

Look out,
