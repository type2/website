If the voltage stabilizer is bad the gauge should be pretty unstable at
all positions.
If it works ok in some places but gets jerky at specific spots then I
would expect it to be the sender.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Q2.  How does the fuel gauge work?  My gauge reads ok when the tanks full
&gt; &gt; &gt; (it shows it as being over 3/4) but when the tank gets down to around half
&gt; &gt; &gt; or less, the gauge jumps around, pegging both ends, frantically.  It doesn't
&gt; &gt; &gt; seem to do it as bad when the car is on but not running.  Thoughts?

&gt; &gt;The problem is intermittent connections in the sender.
&gt; &gt;Inside the sender are 2 stretched conductive wires and a contact on a
&gt; &gt;float the wires can get contaminated spots that dont conduct well and you
&gt; &gt;get a jerky fuel gauge.
&gt; &gt;The best fix is to replace the sender.
&gt; &gt;You can fool with the senders innards but its a real hassle to put it back
&gt; &gt;only to find that it still doesnt work so well.
&gt; 
&gt; I had a fuel gauge that worked like this, and I thought I needed replace the 
&gt; sender. I knew that the sender was alright when I put it in, although it had 
&gt; been sitting for a few years before I started using the car. I thought it had 
&gt; gone bad. I was surprised to find that it worked just fine after I installed new 
&gt; gauges. If you have a spare fuel gauge, or a friend who has one, you could 
&gt; try and hook it up to your car and see if it will solve the problem, just to 
&gt; make sure it is the sender. The fact that your gauge is 'jerkier' when the 
&gt; engine is running could point to a faulty voltage stabilizer, the square thingie 
&gt; behind the fuel gauge.
