 SJ now.

Actually the new(late last year) standard is SM. Which is where the rumors
of reduced zinc levels began.Zinc is a additive used as a lubricant but it
also reduces the life of catalytic converters.In an effort to reduce
emmisions zinc is being phased out and replaced by other additives like
boron and antimony.I like the new SM oils because the base stock is much
better than older oils.Apparently the new SM standard was hard for the oil
companies to meet with plain old oil.Now they are still using regular oil
stocks but it is recieving extensive processing to meet the
standard.Apparently the gap betwween full synthetics and SM oil is much
closer performance wise.I still like the zinc though cause thats what our
older vehicles have used all these years,but you can add it to your
oil.Valvoline synpower treatment is only like $2 a bottle and at an ounce a
quart mixed in the oil lasts a couple of oil changes.Synpower has a bunch of
zinc and some other additives.At the temperatures our vehicles run at the
additives will break down faster so a little boost will help it protect
longer.To think,before Bobistheoilguy_dot_com I just bought hte cheapest oil I
could find and paid absolutly no attention to it.Live and learn.And more on
the diesel oil topic,from what Ive read on bobistheoilguy_dot_com a 15/40 diesel
oil thats also rated for gas engines (CI-4/SL) is a good choice for an
aircooled motor.I cant find it back,but probably a year oag someone posted a
labratory used oil analysis of a 15/40 diesel oil that had been run for 3000
miles in a 1600cc bug with full flow filter and the results were excelent.I
wish I could find it back.The only catch is that your first oil change with
this oil in it should be short because the diesel oils have better cleaning
properties.
