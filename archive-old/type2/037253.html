&gt;The '72 Westy here that I  can't get for a
&gt;penny under 4k is going to cost another 2500 bucks to get the windshield rust
&gt;problem and a couple of other spots and dings fixed and then painted. It does
&gt;have a pancake w/12k on it, but I'll still have 6500 in the thing and some of
&gt;you have already said that's too much.

Forget about this bus. Anybody who isn't budging when you wave 3800 cash under
his nose, is not the type of person you want to buy a bus from. He's too worried
 about
the bottom line, or he's too attached to it to let it go. Not only that, but 12k
 on a rebuilt pancake
isn't any great shakes. Just to believe that was true you'd want to check the
odometer, all his
receipts and ask detailed questions about the rebuild. If he bought a longblock
from GEX, well
he should pay YOU for the bus.

In other words, you don't want to spend a huge amount on a bus. The most I ever
spent was $1500
for my first bus, which was mint, but it was a mistake, because I didn't know a
thing about keeping it alive and ended
up losing it anyway. After that I found a copy of the Idiot book and read it a
few times, then paid $100 for a 77,
$100 for a 69, $125 for a 78, $100 for 66, $350 for an 80, $400 for another 66,
$0 for a 73, $0 for a 71, and now I'm
planning on paying $500 for a 72, which is the most I'll throw down, knowing
I'll have to sink several hundred in parts
to get it rolling.

If you aren't willing to study the books, buy the parts and fix it yourself, it
not economical to own a bus, and even when
you are willing to do all the repairs, the economics are questionable, unless
you develop an eye for  a bus with potential.
I've had the best luck with the buses I've paid the least for...!  I'd look on
the various bus classifieds on the internet, and
wait for something affordable but not mint, and in the meantime read the book!
