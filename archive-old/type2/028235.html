 &gt; What would be the oil temp operating range for a 2.0 liter motor once
 &gt; it is warmed up and that is fairly well loaded and doing 60 MPH on
 &gt; the highway on and 85 degree day?

 &gt; no more than about 230 or so

Here at 8,000ft altitude, I regularly see 240-260, since the air is drier 
and much less dense.  It doesn't cool as efficiently as it does at sea 
level.  Shut it down at 260 no matter what.

YMMV
