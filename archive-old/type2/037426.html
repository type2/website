Sombody posted the message below a few weeks ago.

&lt;It has come to my attention that the Oregon State Legislature
has
it's sights on vintage cars.  According to an article that I got
from
a parts house, Oregon state rep. Richard Devlin has introduced a
bill
that would prohibit the registration of ALL MOTOR VEHICLES
MANUFACTURED
BEFORE 1981 beginning Jan. 1, 2010.  The bill would allow the
registration of
antique or special interest vehicles that HAVE PASSED UNSPECIFIED

EMISSIONS STANDARDS.&gt;

Since I never saw another mention of this again I will post the
message I received when I contacted Oregon state rep. Richard
Devlin.

Mr. Evans,

HB 3217 died during the 1999 Legislative Session.  Representative
Devlin has no plans to reintroduce this
bill in the future.

Heidi Hampt
Legislative Assistant

Dan Evans,  Happy to know we can still drive our old busses
through Oregon.
