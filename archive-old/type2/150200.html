&quot;Free&quot; satellite does still exist. Don't know how well it would work as a
MOBILE setup though.

It's not network programming for the most part. More interesting to news
hounds and techno-geeks.

Read through the whole thread on /.

Look at the lyngsat_dot_com list for free sat channels that originate in the
US. Those are not the only ones you can get. There are still probably
THOUSANDS of free-to-air video and audio channels beaming down from the
sky-birds.

Some links to get you started on the quest:
