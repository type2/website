Subject: (T2)whistle while you work

Hello,
Ian's response contained: &quot;I replaced with a brand new 2bbl single carb....&quot;
 Which one Ian? I am needing a carb right now. The Solex 2 bbl. on my bus is
shot. and no one around here can get parts for it. I was thinking about the
Weber 32/36. Where do you drive yours? Others on the list have warned me
about icing.
Thanks to all who have responded to my questions.
Hoping to make my first get together at the Indigibus in MO.

Dan in Okla. 
'75 trans.
