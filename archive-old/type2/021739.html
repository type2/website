Subject: Re: [T2] homemade instrument cluster

--------------013F1B0C8A14C960DFD96A07

I have an 'extra' instrument cluster at home. The P.O. included it when
I bought my bus. He claimed he had stripped an early 70's westy for
extra parts and this is something he grabbed 'just in case'. I'm not
sure if it works as I've never tested it (hell, I've barely used the one
that's installed in my bus!) but if I recall, it's complete and all
there. Idjut lights, and Speedo. (no RPM guage). Anyways, if you would
rather have something a bit more stock than your disco light LED box let
me know and we can work something out.
