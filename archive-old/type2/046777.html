Subject: [T2] Fuel Vent Elbow part mystery#

On my 72 bus, had a gas smell when fuel tank was full. Thought it would be
the elusive to buy 'filler neck to tank hose' but turned out to be the
rubber elbow out of the center vent that then goes up to the filler neck.

The VW part number on the elbow I took out is 022 129 637 which when
searching Bus Depot is listed as a:
   Intake Elbow, Aux Air Regulator, 74-79 Bus, 80-83 Vanagon

Rocky Mtn Motorworks lists it as:
   Elbow, Aux. Air Regulator, F.I.

Bus Boys catalog illustrates the proper part but does not give a part # for
it (page 31), but again lists my removed part as a FI aux air valve elbow
(page 29).

It looks like the PO had taken a sawz-all and chopped the fuel tank cover
(real hatched job) to approximately the spot of the elbow, bent panel back,
and maybe(?) replaced this elbow at some point (doesn't look that old).

My question is: do you think this is the right part for the application
considering it has fuel sitting in it at fill up.  I'm suspicious as the
part doesn't look that old but is definitely cracked and leaking fuel.  I'm
thinking PO might have just found something that worked and stuck it on, in
light of his lazy approach for fuel tank access.

Was a pain to get to the elbow and want to get it right the first time.

Any thoughts appreciated.

   put back all these parts I took out)
