&gt;Hey all,
&gt;I know some of you folks are in the programming biz, so I have a question
regarding UNIX.  I'm adding some html files and jpegs to my web page (they
are VW jpegs and html files).  I used to know how to do this, but I have
forgotten how to change file permissions so that users accessing my web page
don't get a 403 Forbidden error.  The help files on the computer are not
very helpful at all.

Use chmod 644 *.html

This gives you read and write permissions  (I assume you don't need execute)
and gives everyone else read permissions

&gt;It probably varies somewhat from system to system, but if anyone knows how
to do this, please let me know so you can have more VW stuff to feast your
eyes on.

Actually, its the same across unix machines.
