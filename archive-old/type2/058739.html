Subject: Gus &amp; 12V lights

Charlie,
  We have never met but I am real sorry to hear about Gus. I have
always had a dog, except for the 3 years, 9 months and 27 days
that I was in the military. It is alway hard to lose a good friend!

  On a brighter subject. Anyone can build the 12 V light of their
dreams. Just go to a Auto Parts store or a marine supply store.
Get a 12 Volt bulb holder with a built in mounting bracket an let
your imagination run.
  1) Take an old hurrican lantern, clean the fuel tank area real well
and then remove the wick holder assembly. Install the bulb holder
into this hole. run the wires through the tank an out a hole in the side
that you drill. Install a rubber grommet. You can install a switch
too. You can buy a lighter plug  and just cut the end off and use that
for
your power hook up or you can hard wire it in.
  2) I took an old wooden bowel (small) that I brought back from Asia.
Sanded a flat area on one side and mounted a bulb holder in it. Then
I made a wall mount (thin box) with a switch on it. I attached the
bowel to the wall mount box and mounted it to the divider panal 
behind the drivers seat. You can see it on my page. 
  Any light that might be left on if you like, nod off, should be fused!
Or put a timer switch on it!

   I use the lantern as an outside camp light as I have a long cord on
it
and can hang it wherever I need the light, like the engine
compartment.&lt;grin&gt;
