&gt; Yesterday I was driving my 79 ASI VW and out of nowhere it started making a
&gt; loud &quot;exhaust leak&quot; like noise.  It seemed to lose some power too, and would
&gt; not stay running.  I have not driven it since because I do not want to cause
&gt; any damage.

I had this happen to me. It took me a good hour to figure it out.

This happened on my 411. I was driving along, all of a sudden it sounds
like I dropped the exhaust. I pulled over, couldn't find anything wrong
(it was dark out) and got it home.

I sat there the next day going over the entire exhaust system. No holes
and everything looked ok. I get ready to do the compression test when I
found the (very obvious) problem. It turns out that a spark plug had
worked its way out. *doh*
