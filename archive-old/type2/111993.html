I'm not sure if it is the picture or the van itself, but there seem
to be some wrinkles in the front corner and under the beltline on the
door.  Antenna appears broken off, and the nice body-color emblem hints at
a rattle-can paint job.

Apparently ownership by obscure TV actors is a valuable commodity in
Orange County.  I can't see myself bragging to my friends that my
bus had been owned by Fred Whatshisname!
