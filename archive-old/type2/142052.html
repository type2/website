Subject: Just a thought about holidays

John, you say, &quot;...the swaps tend to include vehicles...&quot; and I am not sure 
that is necessarily the case.  I guess it's a matter of where you draw the 
line.  While it would of course be more economical not to rent a car, there is 
the matter of liability in case of accident.  I think that exchanging cars as 
well as living accommodations would worry most people who own a house and car --
 certainly it would worry hell out of me.  Probably a better idea is to work 
out reciprocal guest arrangements: A visits B for a week, then B visits A at 
some time later.

From: &quot;John Scott&quot; &lt;john.scott02_at_virgin_dot_net&gt;

I live in the UK and have often fancied the idea of holiday house swaps with
people overseas - this is particularly appealing due to cost, as you will all
appreciate ownership of a camper is not cheap (mine is called Miss Moneypit)
and this tends to eat in to holiday budgets, etc.
One of the things that tends to put me off is that the swaps tend to include
vehicles; I only have the camper and I can imagine that somebody who is used
to the pampered luxury of a BM, Merc, etc. would find life in a camper on the
UK's highways and byways  a little hairy to say the least. I would also be
very reluctant to let the uninitiated loose in MM without some form of
training - it took me about two years just to master the gearbox. I would
however, be far more comfortable if that person (s) were type 2 veterans.
Does anybody else find this remotely appealing and/or have any ideas on how
could it be made to work?
