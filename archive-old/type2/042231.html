Subject: Diaphragm-type vacuum unit

See Fig. 6-3, pg 26, Fuel System in Bentley.

What is this and what does it do? It's some sort of intake air preheating
system, but I'm fuzzy on the concept.

Mine was missing and it was suggested I should have one to at least block
off the large hole at the bottom right front of the engine compartment. I
found one at a junkyard and I've installed it. Out of the right side of it
is a large opening, maybe 1.5-2&quot; in diameter. Does this hook up to
something, and if so, what? It looks like an accordion-like air hose would
fit on it.

Also, the right &quot;horn&quot; of the air cleaner has two vacuum hook-ups on the
thermostatic vacuum valve; the brass one that hooks up to the vacuum unit
(check), and the other one. What does the other one hook up to? I've got it
capped for now.

Bentley says: &quot;If the thermostatic valve or vacuum unit is defective, it
should be replaced.&quot; How do you know if they're defective?
