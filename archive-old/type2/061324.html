Question #1The fan housing of my 75 bus is missing the two Air non-return
flaps that are located in the lower half.  When the motor was installed, I
attempted to find a source for them but was unsuccessful.  My question is,
anyone know where I can get them, and that do they do?

Question #2 The plastic accordion adapters from the heater control box to the
heater tubes should have a metal spacer and a felt type gasket.  Where can I
get them or what can I use as a substitute for this gasket?

What a cool resource!
