&gt; Subject: Re: [T2] PICTURES of MY Bus !!!
&gt;
&gt; What is shown is the ad is a common interior/exterior color scheme.
&gt; The brown mats are quite cool! What is uncommon is the really nice
&gt; condition (at least in pics) of the bus.

As common as that color combination is I've found it incredibly hard to find correct interior parts for it. I resurrected a '70 sunroof and then set about trying to find all the right bits and hit a dead end for the longest time. Things like door panels, front mats, and the spare tire cover were only used for 2 years in that combination. Well, actually the door panels for a '69 are different because the vent is white instead of black. But then a few months ago I
found a '69 at PicknPull that was in almost as good of condition as the one in the ad - until it plowed into something and pushed the passenger front almost back to the seat. I was able to salvage 1 door panel, the front floor mat, both large side panels from the middle, and the spare tire cover. But it was crushed before I could get back for more cherry stuff.

By the way, there's one the same color for sale around the corner from my house in Campbell, CA for $1000. If anyone is interested I can get the particulars.
