&gt; Get four rims without tyres from the junkyard or wherever,
&gt; put it on those, and drive it in the garage.  Couple scratches
&gt; on the floor, but hey... less hassle than dismantling the
&gt; garage door isn't it?

Or just let the air out of the tires...?  Of course, that would mean a lot
more effort to push it into the garage if it's *not* running.
