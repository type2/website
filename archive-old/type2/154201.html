Subject: Re: [T2] where to put spare on 77 westy ? Alternate ideas..

There has been a lot of good points about the spare.. you have to make up 
your own mind which option is best for you..
here are some comments of mine..

&gt;&gt; What about a donut spare from some other 5x112-rimmed vehicle like a
&gt;&gt; mercedes or passat? One of those would take up a lot less room under
&gt;&gt; or inside a bus or even (gasp) up front.

I tried the donut spare.. and there doesn't seem to be any nice fitting spot 
for it... outside the vehicle, without cutting into something..
It is smaller,, but doesn't fit the late bay luggage rack..although you 
could notch the fibreglass...  it does fit the early bay luggage rack.
It won't fit up between the frame on the Bay bus..
One trip to New Mexico, I had the collapsible spare in the late bay luggage 
rack with the spare tire gas can as well.. I thought that was comforting.. 
but I bet it was just a false sense of security... that collapsible spare is 
soooo old!

I have toyed with the idea of a rear mounted spare carrier off a receiver 
hitch.. like a bike rack that may hold bikes and a spare... it needs to 
hinge to make it convenient to access the didstick... very easy to fab a 
carrier onto a bike rack.  I have the receiver available ... you can modify 
a rack you buy locally.

Also.. Front mounted receiver with the same idea....  I have the front 
receiver available.. you can modify a rack..

There obviously is many schools of thought here..  you might like the idea 
of adding a little more structure to the front of your bus.. and carrying a 
spare there.. no initial damage done to mount the spare... you can remove 
the spare,, bike rack ,, accessory with one pull pin...


From: &quot;George Lyle&quot;
One thing I found in travelling around in a bus is that I don't go on any
sizable trips without two spares.  One trip I had two belt separations in
less than 100 miles, and the tires were in good shape beforehand.
When you're stuck in Bishop, CA, the correct tires just aren't growing on
trees and the one I finally located suddenly cost a lot more than than it
would have cost to a local.  Not fun.  I finally found a used-tire place
that sold me a passenger-rated tire for $20 to get me 200 miles home.

I agree with George ...same experience!
 I keep 2 spares at home... 200 miles would be nothing to get one delivered 
for me.... &lt;angelic smile&gt;
---- Hi .. Dad?,,,, you busy? &lt;angelic smile&gt;

It was pointed out to me that carrying the &quot;spare in a can&quot; could NOT form 
up a tire when they got as bad as a blow out!
