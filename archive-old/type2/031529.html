&gt; I have been bugging my mechanic to replace the fuel filler neck forever now,

&gt; Im now thinking about the days off I have coming up, and figure I may as 
&gt; well attack this myself. But, what is involved in this?

there are darn few projects I haven't tackled on my 78 but believe me this
job has to rank as one of the biggest PITA jobs I have ever done.  and I
did it while the engine was out.

there is a hose clamp on the inside that holds the inner end.
remove the ECU
remove the disk you mentioned
get a stubby phillips screw driver
get a valium
get a beer. 
turn yourself inside out and reach up and in to find that $#_at_&amp;^ clamp.

then remind yourself, getting it out is the easy part
