hello list.  i have recently been searching in my neck of the woods for
someone to powdercoat my rims.  unfortunately, i think at this point in
time it is going to be too expensive.  so, i was wondering if any
of you out there have painted your rims yourself.  please report on the 
materials you used as well as long term results. i really dont want the
paint to start chipping/flaking 6 months down the road.

&amp; yes, i am planning on getting them sandblasted first.  i just need an
inexpensive but effective method to paint them myself.

TIA.

Joel Wilson
