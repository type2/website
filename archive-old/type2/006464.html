Subject: Oil light flicker:
Date: Wed, 11 Apr 2001 21:44:46 -0500

    With oil pressure specifications from 2 to 6 lb's at idle. Maximum
pressure of 42 lb's, and a minimum of 28 lb's at 2500 rpm's.  I wouldn't be
to concerned about an oil light flicker at idle. I would check the pressure
at 2500 rpm's, and if its ok not worry about flicker!
    Use a good quality master gauge to verify that the sending unit is up to
par. BTW, I would only use a factory sending unit, most of the aftermarket
senders are junk. For the most part you should not be idling for long
periods anyhow, so even the small amount of oil getting to the crankshaft
etc at idle will protect it..
    Use a good oil, change it regularly, don't lug your engine around town
in high gears (keep the rpm's up and the fan going, should not be in high
gear until over 45 mph), and let the flicker fall where it may! If anything
and you just can't stand it, and must spend some money, add an oil temp, and
maybe even a head temp gauge, and watch it, not the oil light flicker at
idle. Besides if the idle speed is set right 900 to 950 rpm's, and you use a
factory sender you may not see the light at all at idle.
    Just my humble opinion. Let the flames begin.

Happy Easter All !!!!!
