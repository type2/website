Subject: Re: busses in Tallahassee, FL

Quoth sallad/dallas, palindromically: 

&gt; I am seriously considering Fl State
&gt; University, and want to know if there is a large bus populus there,
&gt; and about mechanics.  I am just now taking my first autotech class,
&gt; and only know basics.  When big problems happen, I turn to my dad,
&gt; who will be 12 hours away, and can't just come over and fix it.  If
&gt; anyone knows about busses in the Tallahassee area, Id appreciate any
&gt; information you can pass on.
&gt;       Dallas

Need you ask?  Tallahassee: Florida With A Southern Accent is also 
home to:
- - de REAL VW Kanvas web pages (see .sig)
- - at least one or two 'net-dubbers, prolly more lurkers
plus these shops
- - Radical: Car Care for the Cognizant
- - Furrin Auto
- - Bob's VW
plus at least three or four others, reasonably priced.
Last time I checked, we had a couple of decent FLAPS.
Plenty o' busses here, what with the deadhead ratio common in student 
towns.  Pretty decent number of older T1's too - including the '53 I 
saw parked outside of Furrin last week.

Come on down!  My wife works for FSU and we need more students so 
she'll get paid more (yeah, sure).
