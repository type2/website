Subject: Re: [T2] A focused question regarding charging batteries

I have seen this but it doesn't really differentiate between the use of a 
relay to an
isolator. They are talking about the 15 amp relay, but not really explaining 
what happens
if you use something rated higher (ie 90 amp relay or isolator - will it 
draw more or too much for instance).  Small wire vs large (gauge).

Also where to hook it up to and why (in the whole electrical system)

J

	I'm not sure exactly what that 90 amp isolator is rated at, but if
&gt;you haven't seen this post, it's a good summary of how/why stuff
&gt;works.
