Subject: Re: [T2] VW powered air compressor

    I think the best info I can give is, there not very efficient, and
.............$3.00 a gallon gas!!!!!!!

Sears offers a 110 volt compressor for about 100 gallons of gas. It will run
most home shops if you don't try to do to much at a time.
    I think they also offer a gas powered one, but again, mega-bucks to run
it.

&gt; I recall a compressor kit that consisted of a type 1 engine with a
&gt; modified cam and intake. Two cylinders ran under power, and the other
&gt; two made up the compressor. Anybody have any links/info?
