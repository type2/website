Subject: RE: [T2] OUCH $150 for a mechanical fuel pump, how about
  electric?!?!?!?!?

I fried a valve in my 74--

I had the engine in my lap--

It's only got 33,000 original on it--

I changed every hose clamp, exhaust, gasket, screw, titanum valves,
hardest seats I could find, did the hydraulic lifter update, new
phsphorous bronze guides,  and the fuel pump--- ( there was nothing
wrong with the old one, other than being 29 years old and I wanted
new--) the engine is totally fresh--and everything around it--

I'm done---

Stock is best--and in the long run it doesn't cost one dime more to go
first class--and I do know that I won't be having any more down time.

The only reason the late model stuff is running electric pumps is the
pressures the injection needs to pop off the injectors--

This ain't necessary with a carbed vehicle-- 






 
I am not sure I understand, wouldn't using an electric fuel pump be
better than a mechanical one. Especially at that price. No new cars have
mechanical fuel pumps in them nowadays, so they must be better. I have
been running one for the 3 years that I have owned my bus and it has yet
to fail me. For that price, I could have a spare. Just wondering why
anyone would go with a mechanical pump unless they just wanted to be all
stock. Just seems like another part where technology is better now.
