Subject: New bus!!! Answers and Parts Needed!!!

Hey Listees!!!

I traded my 82 Westy for a 71 Westy, the trade had been in the works for 
many months. Check out pics of the trip/trade here:

http://www.livejournal_dot_com/community/aircooledvws/136944.html

The carb is all junked up and it has been rebuilt twice already but the guys 
didn't have high pressure air to really clean out the jets. Can it be 
rebuilt again or should I buy a new one, rebuild the old one and keep the 
old one as a spare??? That's what I'm leaning towards.

When I brake it the engine revs higher, what's up with that? I can't 
remember.....maybe vacuum leak from brake booster line?

I don't have a tiitle, it was a Georgia bus. Anyone have a 71 title and vins 
to sell me? Wait, I didn't just say that, nevermind!!! ;)


Here's what I'm currently looking for, the only things I really want new are 
the cables.

All lenses and reflectors
inside cargo door handle
sun visors
bus jack
bay bentley
spare tire cover
clutch cable
accelerator cable
rear hatch seal
rear hatch mosquito screen

Thanks in advance!
