&gt;I am trying to find the ice tray (that holds the block of ice to keep
things
&gt;&quot;cool&quot; in there) for my 1971 Campmobile icebox.  I have the rack (with the
&gt;&quot;guardrails&quot; all around it) and I am wondering if there's any other
hardware

That rack holds the ice block.  The &quot;guardrails&quot; fit into slots in the
sides of the interior of the icebox to support it within.  Beneath the
wire rack is a very flimsy plastic drip tray to collect the melted ice.
The water is directed from the drip tray through a plastic hose to
drain beneath the vehicle.
You need the wire rack AND the drip tray to make this ice box work
and not have a puddle onboard.  Even when all the equipment is present
and working properly, I find that it performs marginally.  It works well
for storing dry food in a dust/insect free enclosure though.  I keep my
beer (and other cold food) in a portable ice chest where the ice lasts
much longer.  YMMV.

&gt;that goes inside the icebox.  I contacted the folks at Euro American RV (at
&gt;deltasix_at_earthlink_dot_net) and they couldn't help me.  They did have a new
pump
&gt;to replace my leaky one, but I had requested a repair kit (no such luck).

Delta6 has the correct OEM replacement pump at a price.  I bought
a replacement pump from JCWhitney for alot less.  Still works the
same, fits well and looks like the '68-71 OEM pump.

It's a hand-operated pump.  So how do you wash both hands and
keep the fresh water flowing to rinse?  Is this a bug or a feature?  ;-)

&gt;
&gt;Any of you guys have any tips on repairing a leaky faucet pump?

Just replace the damned thing.  It's only about $20 from JCW.

If you need a flimsy drip tray and rubber drain hose, send me some
pmail and I will find you one in the junkyards around here.  I have one
&gt;from a '74 that has a split in it I could glue up and send you.  As far
as I know, these parts are NLA (No Longer Available).
