I have a set of clean, 99% complete stock dual carbs, forsale. They came off 
a 78 Double cab from El Salvador that I have become the owner of. Both have 
been rebuilt. I was going to put these back on but have decided to FI. Come 
with intakes air cleaner,linkage and such,but no dizzy.  200$ you ship. I 
Also have a set of new/ never been instaled solid lifter that I bought from 
Ron. 40$  Thought I would give the list first shot before posting on Ebay.
