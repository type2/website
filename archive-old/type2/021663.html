Subject: Re: [T2] Anti-Seize

haha.. it's far from.  Go look at his site.  They've got some pretty
impressive T4s.  I honestly wouldn't mind hooking my bus up with a more
powerful engine in the future :)

Hey Jake.. question.. 
Have you guys tried your engines with FI?  I understand you're goal is
power and I guess you get more with carbs, but I'd be more interested in
having more power (than I do now) and good fuel economy 20mpg+.  What
kinda MPG could your engines get with an FI system and electronic
iginition/distributorless ignition, etc..

later,
Mike

&gt; How'd you do that? Is this a stock engine with mod's? What kind of $$ are we
&gt; talking about?

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;It should; the big question is, can your Bus make it to 88MPH before it
&gt; runs
&gt; &gt; &gt;into the side of Twin Pines Mall?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think the guys with the rocket launcher proved that VW busses can NOT
&gt; &gt; make 88 mph in a parking lot that size --- and that VW Busses are
&gt; strangely
&gt; &gt; magnetically attracted to Photo-Bug shops...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Wonder if they used a VW bus because it was automatically slower than the
&gt; &gt; star car or because it was cheap?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; However - since it was 1985 or so when that was filmed, and that was a
&gt; late
&gt; &gt; sunroof bay - that dang thing wasn't very old when they wrecked it....
&gt; What
&gt; &gt; a  waste!
