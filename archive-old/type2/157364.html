Subject: Re: [T2] Refurbishing the shift linkage

Greg - why don't you just simply replace the front
section of the rod? It's a five - minute fix and they
couldn't be more than $5 from anywhere! My '74 front
rod section is an exact duplicate of the '79 except
for length. I know, cuz I had them all out trying
this, that and the other thing a few months back.
You'll likely need a new front bushing again.

I played around with moving the coupler on the shift
shaft back at the tranny. Get an extra set screw or
two and carry with you... but the &quot;trick&quot; is to gring
the end of the setscrew flat - or at least much
flatter than it is - and then you can adjust where you
want it. It held for me for just about a full year and
the screw fell out - probably because I didn't LocTite
it in cuz it was temporary! -BaH

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; Following some engine trouble during the JBB trip I
&gt; pulled the motor  
&gt; from the westfakia. And since I also had been having
&gt; some issues with  
&gt; the transmission following the linkage failure on
&gt; the way to  
&gt; BusFusion, I have decided this is a good time to get
&gt; things sorted  
&gt; out properly.
&gt; 
&gt;&lt;&lt;SNIP&gt;&gt;
&gt; the best solution. I have acquired a stock
&gt; stickshift and have  
&gt; decided to modify a rear linkage connector to add
&gt; the extra required  
&gt; length at the back instead of at the front of the
&gt; linkage.
