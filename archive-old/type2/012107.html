&gt; &gt; &gt; So I guess my first step is to back out to an intermediate shim and try to get
&gt; &gt; &gt; my endplay closer to 0.05 and see if that sorts me out for the time being.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; this did it.  not sure what the endplay is now, but I just kept going
&gt; &gt; down in shims until i could turn the crank.  Hopefully this is still in the right
&gt; &gt; endplay range.

and mike dwyer responded:

&gt; 0.006 is the wear limit.  How are you measuring your endplay?

with a snap-on dial gauge, courtesy of Bob (orangevw).  At least that's how 
i had measured it last night at Bob's.  When I drove home (in my honda, with 
the 1600 in the trunk), I realized that the crank (or something) was getting  
hung up on something, and that pehaps I needed to substitute in a smaller shim.

The &quot;whole&quot; story is that we had measured the endplay with the dial gague to 
between 0.06 and 0.07, moved to thicker shims -- i.e. replaced
a 0.024 and a 0.028 with two 0.034's (do I have an extra zero in there?)
and then measured the endplay to be 0.0035-0.004.  When I got home, 
I found out that the engine was hung up and replaced the 0.034's with a
0.030 and a 0.032, and bingo! the engine, she turns.  I'm hoping that since
i just shaved off 0.006 of the 0.016 of shimmage that i added, I'm under
0.006 and hopefully just around 0.004 or 0.005, but i should check with 
Bob's dial gague sometime soon...
