I have to concur with Joe here.....NO RAGS, BAGS, etc. IN THE ENGINE 
COMPARTMENT....PERIOD!!!!!

Back when I was in college, and had my own VW repair business on the side to 
pay the rent, tuition, etc...I can't tell you how many valve jobs, and 
complete rebuilds I did because of rags, etc. that got caught in the cooling 
fan which choked off the air to the cylinders and the heads...

I recall one person, whose engine lunched on the first warm day of late 
winter...when I showed him the problem, he shrugged his shoulders and said: 
&quot;Gee...I wondered where that rag went to....Is that why I wasn't getting 
much heat into the car?&quot;

DUH!!!
