Subject: Charcoal Cannister Hose Connection

Does anyone have a photo that they can pmail me showing the larger hose 
connection from the bottom of the charcoal cannister to the engine tin on a 
late bay?  Looked at Richard Atwell's nice photo of the hose connections on 
his bus, but they don't show this connection.  Also, the charcoal cannister 
on my bus lives back near the RH rear turn signal.  I don't believe my has 
ever been connected (as long as I've owned the bus), but I understand that 
the hose connected to a port near the alternator.  All I have there now is 
an about 1/2 inch flush hole in the tin.

Thanks,

Bob
