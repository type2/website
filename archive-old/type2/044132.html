Whilst we're on the topic of squeaks, ever since I had new rear wheel
bearings and brakes fitted to my 79 bay, there is a squeak from the rear
right hand wheel when I drive at very low speeds. It's not the brakes
AFAICS, and not the CV joint. I uncoupled the CV joint so I could spin the
the wheel. It doesn't seem to be a problem that I can tell but I'd like some
comment on whether it might turn out to be something bad. I've tried packing
extra grease into the bearings, but no effect.

The sound is almost like there's a rubber seal rubbing against the spindle
as it turns.
