Subject: Re: [T2] Best way to wire an aftermarket fuel pump

just a heads up to the FI crowd.  midamerica motorworks, who i usually
don't buy from because they are so pricey,  now carries some very
reasonably priced remann'ed FI parts.  afms, injectors, fuel pumps and
auxiliary air valves.  python is the rebuilder.  i don't know much
about them or their quality of work, but i thought the aav was
obsolete so when i saw a remanufacturer (is that a word?) just wanted
to pass it on.


jeremiah

p.s. i'm keeping my FI despite its shortcomings mainly because i'm
just beginning to figure it out and i don't want to take the time to
learn anything new.
