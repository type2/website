Subject: Re: [T2] Underbelly gas heater in a '79 bus

&gt;      I have a chance to buy a '79 bus (no motor or transmission) with a
&gt; under-belly gas heater (BA-6??).  Anyway, the heater system is complete.
&gt; What is involved in pulling the heater and transferring the complete heat
&gt; system into a '76 Westy?

Yes, it is a BA6.
Good luck!  The floor is different. You will find a duct that is mounted
under the rear seat that was put in before the rear torsion tube was
installed. With the tube in, you cannot get the duct out! [this duct pulls
the air from inside the bus to run thru the heater] Also, the main unit is
mounted on rubber mounts, like the FI fuel pump, that are screwed to
brackets. These brackets are welded to the frame.....they are not there on a
bus without the BA6 heater....

&gt; Also, what is the going price for a complete
&gt; under-belly gas heater system?

No idea....
I had the same idea, pulled a complete BA6 from a Canadian 79 also.....
still haven't installed it in my 77.
