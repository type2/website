Subject: Re: exhaust studs... (broken weld)

Hey Snoop.  I found the same on my bus last fall, and had a friend stick
weld it back on (along with reinforcing the others).  I know someone
else said the weld might not hold, but it's been over a year and mine's
been holding up just fine (and it's seen some rough terrain).

Hope this helps
-Roger

&gt; Well when I was working on my exhaust/heaterboxes I found my leak.. It seems
&gt; the part of the heater box that actually connects to the head fell off.
&gt; Looks like it will be JB weld tonite.  As I have been told  That part is
&gt; cast iron, and the pipe is steel so it is beyond my friends welding
&gt; capabilities.
