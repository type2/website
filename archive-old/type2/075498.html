Subject: Goodbye for now

I think I have had enough of the list for a while. I'm reading so much 
these days for my classes that I really don't have enough time for things 
like the list.

Most of the topics I have interest in have also been covered a few times. 
Time to move on to other topics in my life and find the time and the money 
to complete our '78 Westy!

I want to thank the list owners and list admin for your time and effort and 
money invested.

I want to thank all of the list members who have added interesting topics, 
interesting answers, and who have always been striving to make their bus 
nicer than it was when they got it. And especially those who have strived 
to make it more than it was when it left the factory. Updates are good.

For you newbies - hang in there - this list can talk you through ANYTHING. 
This list is more important than any other resource we have short of our 
aftermarket suppliers.

For any of you looking at the Trans-Vair conversion I'll still be working 
towards the completion of that project. Write anytime for an update or my 
.02 for your questions.

See ya!!!

'78 Westy Trans-Vair in the making
