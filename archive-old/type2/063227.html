&gt;Thing is, we just noticed a Westphalia sticker on a cabinet (previuously
covered 
&gt;by old carpeting) that says Campmobile 70.

On both my '70 and '71 Westy, the metal Westfalia tag on the rear seat said
&quot;Campmobile 70&quot;.  I chalked this up to Westfalia making the label in the
calendar year of their conversion (or maybe they just overproduced the tag
that says '70 and slapped it on both the '70 and '71s!!).  Or perhaps the
'68-'69 Westy interior is slightly different from the '70-'73 and the plate
designates the first year for that specific interior style.  Anyhow, FWIW,
I've encountered what you are seeing.  If anyone knows the real reason
behind this label mystery, please post it so I can add it to my useless VW
trivia databank!

BTW, at the Woodstock, NY show last weekend, there were period VW trivia
questions posted on the PA system--whoever came up with the first correct
answer won a little prize.  I didn't participate, and the few questions I
heard I didn't know the answers to anyway. 

Made-up trivia question:  How many VW newbies does it take to overtorque an
oil sump plate stud?

Answer:  Just one, every single one!
