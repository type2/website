Message-ID: &lt;7kk3aj$7l2v_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

Anyone know if I can change this flange(71 Bus) without pulling the sterring wheel off  to lift up the column tube? It looks to me as if I can get at it from the inside of the bus( 4 bolts)Any help is greatly appreciatted from someone who has changed one of these. The one in there now has some cracks in it. 
TIA , Andy
