I've noted that the AMC heads seem to maintain this raised cylinder head
mating area, and the Heads Marked with the VW OEM casting mark seem to
become more recessed over a period of use.

Do you suppose that this condition on the VW OEM head was caused by the
heads being over torqued or over heated?

I've never had a new VW OEM head so I don't know exactly how they look
when they're new.

Since my engine is already installed and I'm past the point of no return
on setting this up I'm pretty well stuck with what I've got on the
current engine.

However I've almost got enough parts to build an additional engine as a
spare and since I'm not in any hurry to get it together I'd like to take
that extra care and try to get the ideal performance. I have one of each
of the heads, one VW OEM and one AMC, I think I'll wait until I can match
the heads to the same manufacturer before I go any farther.

I don't turn my Vanagon engine more that about 4500 Rpm and I'm not shure
that balancing would be that much of an improvement but I'm considering
it also.
