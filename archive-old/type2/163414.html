In addition to possible coil failure, be sure to check EVERY ground wire
connection and all other electrical connections (especially the coil
connections) in the engine compartment.  Having owned an 80 7 pass model a
dozen + years ago, I know from first hand experience mine was a combination
of both.

A similar situation on my 84 Wasser when I first got it running in
1997 turned up the same gremlins and and culprits.

&gt; Hi Nathan,
&gt; Classic symptoms of coil failure. Happened to me on the way to the
&gt; Outer Banks of NC on vacation in April last year. 10 minutes in an
&gt; AutoZone parking lot and $25 later I was on the road trouble free.
&gt; Jeff Stewart had the same issues on the way to EB2001; I learned the
&gt; symptoms from his misfortune.
&gt; That was until the Auto Zone coil blew out completely in MD coming
&gt; home from  John Brown's Buses in October. One minute it was fine, the
&gt; next I was coasting to the side of the road. Luckily Dad was carrying
&gt; a spare engine for me at the time; we pulled the coil off that one
&gt; and were back under way within 5 minutes.
&gt; Happy Trails,
&gt; Greg Potts
