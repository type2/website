Subject: RE: [T2] installing seat pedestal mats--tips? warnings?

  Be careful if using the 3M spray glue. The foam backing could have the
tendency to melt down. I used a paint on adhesive I got at an upholstery
supply that is made foam gluing up foam backed headliners.

Ronnie  just my opinion

Hey Bill
3M trim glue spray works as good as anything else. I used it to lay carpet
in the westy front and rear and held up pretty good. Probably about 2 cans
to do the front as you spray both sides

&gt; Greetings, folks:
&gt;
&gt; I got inspired several weeks ago, beginning with reupholstering the
driver's
&gt; seat on my 1970 [and having it come out looking pretty good, somewhat to
my
&gt; surprise], so I re-covered the passenger seat and replaced the kickboards,
&gt; too. Now I'm about to install new pedestal mats.  I've got both parts, and
&gt; they're here on my living room floor, breathing.
&gt;
&gt; I have a general idea of what's going to be involved with the
installation:
&gt; I can see where the pieces generally fit, and where they will have to be
&gt; carefully cut to let hardware pass though the material. Now I have some
&gt; specific questions before I get into it:
&gt;
&gt; * What holds the mats in place? [The fact that I don't know the answer to
&gt; that shows just how little is left of my old mats!] I've found some clips
&gt; that seem designed to hold the side pieces where the walk-through is; are
&gt; there others? Or is it mainly gravity and the seat belt buckle anchors
that
&gt; hold the pieces in place?  I also see traces of what might once have been
&gt; blobs of adhesive on the metal pedestal in places where the original mat
is
&gt; long-gone. Will I need to use some adhesive at some spots?
&gt;
&gt; * In addition to pulling the seats out and removing the seat belt buckle
&gt; anchors, what else has to be moved for the installation? Does the panel
&gt; behind the passenger seat have to come out?
&gt;
&gt; * Anything else I should consider before I get into the middle of the
&gt; procedure and realize I've painted myself into a corner?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance!
&gt;
&gt; Bill
