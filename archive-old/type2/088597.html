Subject: Aren't kids great?

Got a call from my sister yesterday morning, she'd borrowed my camper to get
to work because her motorbike got stolen.  Camper wouldn't start.  Just
turned over and over.

So I went round last night and found the trouble -- kids had opened the
engine bay (lock hasn't worked since I bought it,) pulled the wiring from
the coil and stolen some of my HT leads.  They'd nicked my gas cap, too, and
sprayed my bumper for me.

Does anyone in the UK have a gas cap or an engine bay lock for a '73 bay
window they feel like selling?

Is the gas cap supposed to be lockable?

He had seen a few smiles he might have killed for, but never one he'd have
died for. What else could he do but smile back?
