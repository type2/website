Does anyone know of a way i can mount my spare on the front of my westy
other than the standard factory bracket on a 74cuz it leaves a nasty
scratched up black circle on the front of my van. I spent all summer doing
body work and painting it and almost cried when i took all the accesories
off to store it for the winter
so escentially i need to find a way to lift it only a little so it doesn't
rub and trap road gunk that wrecks my new paint
