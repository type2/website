I agree with Tom. I just sold a 71 Westy in Good shape for under $3000.00 
with a fresh rebuild. It was promptly driven to Florida from NH.

I also have a 79 Bus with a good body for sale with no tranny or engine.
It has original paint, no body work anywhere, and a bit of surface but no
rot. I would take under $500.00. Will post on my website in the next few
days.

&gt; Assuming you have a few spare parts around the garage, I'd say that $2000
&gt; will often do just fine to acquire a good bus. This is from experience in
&gt; 1996.
&gt;
&gt; $ 150  1971 type 2, blown engine, body and tranny in reasonably good shape
&gt; $1300  NEW engine
&gt; $ 300  tires
&gt; $ 250  other sundry parts (brake shoes and pads, registration, other stuff)
&gt;
&gt; The key here, of course, is to find somebody with an otherwise good bus
&gt; but no engine. They are out there.
