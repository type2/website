&gt; Hi Mark,
&gt; Well, if it can be arranged well see what we can do for you.
&gt;
&gt; But hang on a dang minute here.... Do you even own a running
&gt; Baywindow bus??  Every time I've seen you it's been with a splitty or
&gt; a vanagon.
&gt;
&gt; Doesn't the hubcap had to be carried in a Bus??? I think the list
&gt; should weigh in on this one.

air cooled splitty, bay, vanagon should be ok...
