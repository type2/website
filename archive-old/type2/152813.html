Subject: Re: [T2] portland, oregon - safe parking request

I know the last train heading west is at 1:15 downtown (other side of the
river, but only a 2 stops west of the rose garden).

I would offer a spot in my driveway, but unfortuantely, I am way out in
hillsboro, we are a few blocks away from the LAST stop westbound.

If you cant find anyone else, please let me know, it is definately a long
ride home though :(

Good luck!

&gt; all
&gt; for it.

&gt; Hiya Steve,
&gt;
&gt; How about parking the Bus someplace safe and taking Max? It'll drop you
&gt; off
&gt; at the door to the Rose Garden. That alternative would (at the very least)
&gt; expand your possibilities a great deal.
