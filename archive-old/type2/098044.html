Congrats, Jason!

My only question has to do with the spacer between the inner and outer
bearings that you mention in the quotes above.  In my experiences, I have
never been able to remove it thru the outer bearing, which both Bentley
and your post imply is possible.  Were you able to do this?  I have always
had to work around it with the punch, which is a royal PITA!
