Subject: Re:Info on June show on Long Island

Hi Al,
    I believe I was the one who posted what you originally saw.  Well first
of all, the event in June is not a show but a camp out that is being put on
by our local bus club, The Bus Alliance.  The dates are June 7th to 9th and
for more info check out the web page at   http://arasso.tripod_dot_com/limbo/ or
e-mail Andrea at arasso_at_yahoo_dot_com  or call 631-475-8620.
    Now, if it's shows you are looking for, there will be 2 of them here on
Long Island in the month of  May.
1.    5/4  Three Bugs in a Barrel
Country Fair Entertianment Park, Medford, NY
631-842-2555 or livc_at_howlingdogstudios_dot_com

2.    5/26   NEVA's 9th Annual Spring Thing
   PAL   Sports Complex in Holtsville, Long Island, NY
516-799-4395 or neva_at_glenn-ring_dot_com

    Of course that second one is the same weekend as Westies In The Woods,
in nearby New Jersey.  It's usually a pretty good weekend.  For info on
that, go to http://home.earthlink_dot_net/~rmaxon/   You'll just have to decide
if it's a show or a campout that you want for that weekend.  Of course some
people do cut the camping weekend short to come back for the show, in which
case you can have your cake and eat it too!
    If you'd like info on the Bus Alliance just e-mail me off list and I'll
fill you in on the details.  pa.ka_at_verizon_dot_net
