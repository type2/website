John:
I have been told (by my brother in law who is a Penzoil/Quaker State Rep)
that the synthetic oils will leak a lot worse in an older vehicle.  Given
that VW's are notorious oil drippers, this would a  problem in most engines
except a fresh rebuild without drips.

Trusting your report that the synthetic 5-50 performs well, what are your
comments about its greater propensity to leak in a VW engine with all those
seals and cracks?

Our testing has shown that Quaker State FULL (not blend) Synthetic 5-50 is
outstanding. It also drops the oil temps 15 degrees with NO change in head
temps.

Don't believe all the HS you read with some VW guys on how &quot;bad&quot; synthetics
are in aircooled engines.
