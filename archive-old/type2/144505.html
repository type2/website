&gt; &gt; The &quot;Matthew, open the westy roof please&quot; system works quite well, I
&gt; &gt; use it whenever I'm camping with the family. The  system was a lot of
&gt; &gt; fun to create and develope, but the maintenance costs are pretty
&gt; &gt; steep. ;-P
&gt; &gt;
&gt;    &quot; I'm sorry, Greg, I'm afraid I can't do that... &quot;

Ah, you have to do it right...

Greg: Open the westy roof please, Matthew.
Matthew: I'm sorry Dad, I'm afraid I can't do that.
Greg: What's the problem?
Matthew: I think you know what the problem is just as well as I do.
Greg: What are you talking about, Matthew?
Matthew: This camping trip is too important for me to allow you to
jeopardize it.
Greg: I don't know what you're talking about, Matt?
Matthew: I know you and Mom were planning to ground me, and I'm
afraid that's something I cannot allow to happen.
Greg: Where the hell'd you get that idea, Matt?
Matthew: Dad, although you took thorough precautions in the tent against
my hearing you, I could see your lips move.
