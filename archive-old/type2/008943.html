Your mechanic didn't know he had to pull the engine?  I'd find a new
mechanic.  In VW's words, you're paying him to _learn_ to work on VWs!

&gt; Nashville's best
&gt; known VW mechanic, Paul Shirley, having retired, I called a place in a
&gt; neighboring town I had heard about. They informed me that they
mostly do
&gt; bugs and wouldn't touch a bus fuel tank job &quot;because you gotta take
the
&gt; motor out&quot;.

At least they knew what was involved!

&gt; Now I'm out of options other than doing it myself. Problem is, I
know these
&gt; later model tanks have more lines coming out of them to accommodate
the
&gt; dual carbs on the original motor. I'm sure I can figure out what
goes where
&gt; by observing the existing tank, but I don't know how to plug the extra
&gt; lines. What should I use?

You can get ready-made plugs for the unused connections or you can
simply use short sections of fuel line with a metal plug pushed in the
free end.  Some folks use a ball bearing slightly larger than the ID
of the tubing, some use a bolt with an unthreaded shank.
