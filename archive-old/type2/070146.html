&gt; The VIN is 265050543. Does this mean my car was made on 10.29.64?

&gt; the  265 in the vin means  a 65 truck
&gt; 
&gt; the first line suggests an oct 29th production date
&gt; 
&gt; are you sure the vehicle is registered correctly?   does it have pull out or
&gt; push button cab door handles?

My error. It is a '65. I said '64 because I thought a manufacture date of 10/29 meant a 
'64 model date. It has push-in buttons but the previous owner said it had a 40 Hp 
engine. Doesn't this VIN suggest a 50 HP?
