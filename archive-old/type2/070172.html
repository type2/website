  So, there really were sadists at Westfalia!  Custom ording 6-foot sideways
grain!

anyone know how many campers they were churning out in the mid 60's?     i
have a feeling it was enough to put a serious dent in the german birch
forests, maybe support a mill or two for years?    they made enough campers
that the kombis made for delivery to the westfalia factory were somewhat
different. (ie interior of rear painted, not just primer grey).  why not
order loads of special sized wood?   if you ordered enough for ten or twenty
thousand campers, i doubt the price per sheet would vary significatly from
sheets with the grain running the standard direction.   and think of all
those roof panels too!!!!       
 i dont want to have to find new wood for the roof panels.   


&gt; another pervert trinket - 67s used phillips head screws on the
&gt; westy wood panels (and on the deluxe trim strips and to hold the
&gt; jailbars on),  not slotted screws like the other years

I have the phillips head screws on my '67 Deluxe trim strips.  I
also had phillips screws on the '67 I parted out and on the '66 I
still have for parts.  All three of these deluxes have slotted
screws on the jail bars.  Knowing the PO of one of them, he
certainly did not change them.  He just watched it rust.

curiouser and curiouser said alice.  now ill be looking at these screws till
i get a clear idea of which kind was used exactly when on what.  i thought it
would be something simple like it was all changed at once.     (ha ha)

&gt; (like really, who cares?)

Oh, *somebody* must.  I don't see any any cause to get bent out
of shape here.  I like finding out all the little variations and
nuances.  It's like having a big crossword puzzle and filling in
the blanks, except the more we fill in, the more blanks appear.
I love a good mystery.

me too, i was just laughing at myself.   it is really silly to think about
which kind of screw was used on which year.  and that the panel screws for
the westy wood panels are not the same as the panel screws for the standard
vw panels.    ( sorry, you could have won the class, but the bus has the
wrong kind of screws).  but then again,   why  not?     this is more obscure
and less fancy in that it doesn't call for some wierd part than some of the
things people do to restore their buses, but whatever floats your boat.   and
ive seen a lot of buses in the shiny mags with something as dumb as
mismatched bumpers and bumper trim and a black plastic tire cover in a split
window bus.   but have you seen many splittie tire covers in good shape?  i
have one for a bus with a mesh platinum interior, actually, if anyone is
interested and can find me one to match a blue 67 deluxe interior- the shiny
light blue colour, please tell me about it!
