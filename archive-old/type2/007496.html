Subject: Wiring for realy of  second battery for 79 Westy 
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hi:

Thanks to Christopher Darilek and Adrian Livesley for their posts.

To Christopher: I can only surmise that the purpose of this relay
besides allowing the charge of the second battery is to prevent the
discharge of the main (right side of the bus) battery in case the
second (left side of the bus) gets totally discharged. In my van,
the fridge (and fridge's fuse) seems to be connected directly to this
battery (quite a draw, if it is forgotten on). I have always wondered
if this second battery fed an autonomous circuit in the camper and if so
what devices were connected to it. I also remember from many years ago
a german mechanic telling me that the relay allowed a draw from the main
battery but not the other way around ?????? Another mechanic seemed to
be quite irate about this relay business having classed it in the not
worthy to understand idiosincrasies of Westies and proposed to replace it
by a much simpler &quot;switch&quot; that would only allow charging of the second
battery.

Any comments on this somewhat arcane topic ????

To Adrian:

When I say &quot;relay&quot;, I am talking about a more or less one (1) cubic inch
device in the form of a cube attached to the inside of the engine compartment
close to the upper left hand part of the edge of the opening
of the engine compartment. To my recellection, was attached to this device
(i.e. &quot;relay&quot;) a number of wires: one came from the positive post of the
second (spare) battery to one of the flat male contact of the &quot;relay&quot; ;
another wire went from the positive post of the main (right side of van)
battery to another flat male contact of the &quot;relay&quot;, and that wire is attached
to the body around the upper part of the engine opening; and at least one if
not two other wires were attached to other of these flat male contacts of the
relay? The whole of which appearing to be factory
installed for this 1979 Westy (Fed version).

Thanks
