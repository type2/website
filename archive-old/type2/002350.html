Hello everyone,
This is shawner123 posting from another address about the Ghetto Cruiser.
I'm looking to install some heat, and It would be of great help if somebody
knew were I could find images of what the booster fan looks like installed
on a 1700 Pancake, I'm not as familiar with those.
Thanks for your help,
Capt Tripps
