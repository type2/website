Subject: Re: smells like gas.

Sounds like you have some old, cracked, leaky fuel lines.  It
gets worse as it gets colder.  I remember driving over a mount
north east of Bryce Canyon a few years back in the middle of
a winter snowstorm.  It was either freeze, but get a serius
buzz and risk becoming a bomb.  Needless to say, all the fuel
lines were replaced very shortly thereafter..

My bus didn't show signs of leaking either, until I got to
altitude in the cold.  You said that you only smell the gasoline
when it's cold.
