Subject: Re: [T2] 1600cc flywheel bolt sizes.

Type 3s originally shared the same gland nut as their Type 1 &amp; 2 cousins at
36mm hex. However, a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, an outfit
produced a &quot;Super&quot; Gland Nut that was, I believe around 38 40 or even 46mm
hex. I'm not even sure it's available anymore (I think it was Johnny's Speed
&amp; Chrome).
 I'm not saying other places like EMPI/Mr Bug/Autohaus or Dee Engineering
(Bugpack) once offered it, but I don't see it in their current catalogs.
Gone the way of the Edsel I guess (just like Johnny's).
 Now that you have it off, pitch it and put an original 36mm hex Gland Nut
on that flywheel and you (and subsequent owners) won't have this problem
again.
 VW # 111 105 305 E
EMPI # 4029 (comes w/washer)
EMPI # 4026 (Chromoly Gland Nut w/Washer)
**Note: EPMI's current 2005 catalog says &quot;features a 36mm size, not a funky
1 7/8&quot; &quot;.

&gt; Hello List,
&gt; I thought that all 1600cc motors used a 36mm bolt for the flywheel. The
&gt; type 3 motor that I'm working on right now doesn't. Neither my 36mm or
&gt; 1-7/16 sockets fit on the sucker. Had to use a 1-1/2...it was all that I
had
&gt; that was close...it felt a little loose so I'm assuming its a 38mm socket,
&gt; which I don't have. The motor is a dual port 1600cc type 3 motor (TO). I
was
&gt; intending on replacing the bolt, pilot bearing and flywheel after putting
in
&gt; a new main seal. What part number am I looking for? Should the 36mm version
&gt; work? I don't have any extras laying around to test.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone have any experience with this?
