Subject: Fuel Filler Neck
Message-ID: &lt;3723656F.ABEA0243_at_home_dot_com&gt;

I seem to have run into a stumbling block on readying my '72 westy for
this years camping.  The 2 1/4&quot; fuel filler neck is no longer
obtainable  from VW.  I searched the archives and found mention of it
several times yet havn't seen a replacment or alternative solution. 
Since its hard to inspect the 90' bend area next to the tank i'm leary
of using standard straight Gates hose with a 90' elbow of some type
although thats about the only solution other than going strait and
cuttin a hole on the body for a new gas cap fitting.  Has anyone
retrofitted or otherwise found a solution for this problem?

Thanks
Mark
