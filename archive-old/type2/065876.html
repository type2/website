Subject: aftermath of overheated engine

Hi all,
        Last week I was tooling down the I-5 and my mind must have been
wandering enough that I didn't notice the red gen light come on, or the
pegged oil temp guage.  My engine started stalling and I looked down in
horror and noticed the VDO oil temp guage read 300F+!
        So I pulled over and opened the engine cover to find that the belt
had been completely shredded.  I replaced the belt, waited for the engine
to cool down, and tried and tried to start the engine, but no go.
Eventually, I noticed that there was hardly any compression since it was
so easy to turn over the engine with the spark plug wrench on the
generator pulley.  So, I checked the valves, and sure enough, there was no
gap on any of the valves, the valves had all stretched.  So I adjusted all
the valves, and she started right up.
        Now I only have a few problems with the engine:  I checked
the compression, and they were like 124, 90, 90, 86.  This seems kinda
low, especially since the engine was rebuilt 30,000 miles ago.  However,
they never were above 125 since the rebuilder put in &quot;low compression&quot;
pistons which he said would prevent overheating pulling long hills in
the bus.
        The other problem I have is that when I really step on the gas,
there is a loud sound that sounds like a bad muffler.  It only happens
when I really step on it though, or when I'm going up a hill, and it seems
to be worse when its cold.  I was wondering if anybody has had something
similar happen to them.  I thought I might just have a bad muffler, or
maybe a cracked manifold, heat exchanger or head, so that some of the
exhaust leaks making a big racket when I really step on it.  Any ideas as
to what is causing the bad muffler-like sound?  Whatever it is, the engine
seems to be running about the same as it was before I had the overheating.

thanks in advance,

John
