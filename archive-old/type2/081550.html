Subject: Cheap easy bus front seat upholstry

The front seats in Das Bus were down to springs and a bit of fabric. We =
bought a queen sized foam mattress cover for about $20.00 and some slip =
covers, then cut the foam to fit slit the sides of the old seats and =
stuffed the foam in. The slip covers went on, took a couple of hours and =
probably cost $40.00 all told and work beautifully.=20
I'll restore those later.
