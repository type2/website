Did anyone hear this weekends Car Talk on NPR.  The had a show where the
audience nominated the 10 worst cars of the millennium.  Guess what was
on that list - that's right, our beloved bus.  Comments, no handling, no
heat, no anything, a death trap in a front end collision but then it
would be impossible to go fast enough to hit anything in the front. 
Other nominees - Chevy Vega and Chevete, Plymouth Valarie, Fiat x 1/9,
Renualt Dalphine and Le Car, Cadilac Cimmoron, Ford Expidition, any car
from Dihatsu, VW Thing, Ford Pinto, AMC Gremalin.  Just thught I lit you
guys know (PS I know i have some misspelling here)
