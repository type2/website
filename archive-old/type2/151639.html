Subject: late bay window fuel economy

Guys,

Was just looking at one of the original brochures over on thesamba and the 
top speed and fuel economy on a 78 bus jumped out at me again.

Realized that some time ago I meant to go and see what the actual 
city/hiway driving cyle at EPA looked like.

No wonder the bus got 25mpg hiway listing....


See it here:
http://www.fueleconomy_dot_gov/feg/info.shtml

Essentially though here is how the hiway part looks:

&quot;The test simulates a 10-mile trip and averages 48 mph. The maximum speed 
is 60 mph. The test is run with the engine warmed up and has little idling 
time and no stops (except at the end of the test).&quot;

Cheers, dave
