Subject: VW Curtain Fabric

Does anyone have curtains for your camper/bus made of Sunbrella
material?  Janyce made some out of Sunbrella fabric and the material
is so stiff they cannot even be pushed back on the curtain rods when
we want to open the curtains.  Is anyone experiencing this difficulty
Sunbrella fabric curtains?  Is there a way to soften this material so
it can be used for curtains?  Thanks in advance.
