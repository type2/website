Hey Volks,
The Avavcado (76 Westy-weber progressive) has developed some severe oil
leaks. Looks to be the flywheel seal due to an incredible amount of oil on
the starter, as well as the fan(rear?) seal. I am taking it to my mechanic
tommorow to confirm my diagnosis. If it is as I fear, I will have my
mechanic drop the engine and replace the flywheel seal as I am not confident
that I can do this in a timely fashion. I think that I could do the rear
seal myself, but as long as the engine is out what else should I check or
do? This engine just turned 100,000 miles and runs strong. It sat for a few
months before I purchased it and no leaks were apparent after several
hundred miles of local driving , mostly 20-45 minute trips. After the first
&quot;real&quot; roadtrip(150 miles one way) I noticed a few spots underneath. After I
got home and looked more closely, I discovered oil all over the starter and
the case, as well as in the engine compartment. I thought that the oil in
the compartment could be from the oil pressure sender, but now it looks like
it was sucked in there by the fan. I am pretty sure that it is the seal in
front of the fan. I am rambling...
What should I do if the engine comes out? I plan to inspect my fuel tank and
replace all fuel lines, and I will have a look at the filler hose. Anything
else that I should do as long as the engine is out?

TIA,
Andy
76 westy, the Avacado
