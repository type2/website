Bob

&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt;     I'm new to the list, so let me introduce myself a little bit.  Ive known 
&gt; of the list for a while, I'm also a member of the Type3 list.  I live in 
&gt; southern california, Burbank, right near Los Angeles. I have a 1967 fastback 
&gt; project sitting in my driveway.  I am fairly new to bus ownership, I bought a 
&gt; 1970 panel van on Sept. 2, 2001.  I live in southern california, I bought the 
&gt; bus in eastern Colorado, and drove it home, 1200 miles no problems.  In 1997, 
&gt; the owner at the time had the engine rebuilt, stock 1600dp with a new case 
&gt; and new heads.  The original owner kept fairly good records, some of which I 
&gt; have.  I am at least the 3rd owner, possible more, but Im not sure.  Since 
&gt; I've had it, It has been my daily driver, and I've put at least 4000 miles on 
&gt; it.  It has given me very little trouble...
&gt;     ...until recently.  On and off, there were times when It wouldnt start.  
&gt; Get in, turn the key, nothing.  The &quot;Idiot lights&quot; would dim, but the starter 
&gt; wouldnt go.  I was a little pressed for time, checked the engine, checked the 
&gt; fuses, 1 was burnt out, replaced it, it made no difference, decided to push 
&gt; start it, and deal with it later.  
&gt;     when leaving, it started right up, drove it to a friends house, dropped 
&gt; her off, it wouldnt start.  pushstart it again, drive home.  that was early 
&gt; december.  After that, It worked for the most part, giving me little trouble. 
&gt; The day after christmas, it wouldnt start, and hasent started by itself 
&gt; since.  
&gt;     I thought perhaps it was the battery, so I took it out and recharged it, 
&gt; and installed a &quot;hard-start relay&quot; in the bus.  Put the battery back in, all 
&gt; the lights were brighter, but no go.  Its not the battery. 
&gt;     Tried starting it with the light switch, as per Bentley, and the lights 
&gt; stay on, no dimming, and no go on the starter.
&gt;     Climbed under and connected the terminals on the soleniod, the starter 
&gt; runs.  Its not the starter.  whats left?  the wiring or the ignition switch, 
&gt; right?
&gt;     Pulled out the lock cylinder and ignition switch,  turned the key, and 
&gt; connected the contacts for the &quot;red&quot; wire and the &quot;red w/ black stripe&quot; wire 
&gt; together, on the back of the  ignition switch and nothing...
&gt;     So that rules out the ignition switch.  So, its the wiring...?  The 
&gt; connection to the starter motor is good, all the conenctions on the ignition 
&gt; switch are good, the the connection to the headlight switch is good.. 
&gt; everything seems clean and tight, and ive run out of ideas.   There will be 
&gt; further testing on the switch and other stuff.. but I don't know what else to 
&gt; do... please help me!  I've run out of ideas. Sorry If this email got a bit 
&gt; lengthly.
