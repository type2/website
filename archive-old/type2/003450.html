Here's the ad that appeared in our local paper:

&quot;VW '92 Westfalia, camper, 4 spd. trans, 48K mi., 2K on new eng. &amp;
clutch, new tires, $5500 925/283-7899&quot;

It's an '82 (obviously) and I went over and looked it over, talked to
the owner, and took it for a drive.

According to the owner, this van came from Arizona where, he was told,
it sat for many years, hence the low mileage.  It's got the 6-digit
odometer so it's not ?48,xxx miles masquerading as 48,xxx miles.
Rubber on the pedals looks about right, ball joints are still OK,
etc., so it really could be a 48K mile car.  I believe the owner said
he's owned the car about two years.

According to the owner, all the camping equipment works, except that
he has a hard time getting the refer to light on propane.  (Haven't I
heard that before on these lists!)  Canvas looks very good (no tears,
rips, mold) but the screen has a few holes in it.  All the curtains
still there.  Missing front table.  Swivel seats.  Single battery.
Switch for water pump is funky so the owner installed a toggle switch.

The body I'd rate as &quot;very good.&quot;  There's a small, pretty shallow,
dent right under the front window rubber and a little rust has
developed.  The window has a small crack in this area also.  The
rightside rear lower panel has been inexpertly painted, though I
missed it the first time as it was fairly cloudy when I first looked
at it.  According to the owner, there was some rust developing between
the seam at the junction of the wheel well and the panel above it
which he worked on.  He did the painting with some touch-up paint.
There's a few short paint scratches on the rear lift window.  Not much
else to comment on.

The interior is also &quot;very good&quot; with all carpeting in place, good
Vanagon seats (maybe replacements), dash clean, interior panels
looking good, etc.  The only thing I saw was that the vinyl on the
bottom on the upper bed was torn in several places.  Owner-installed
stereo.

I drove the van around town and on the freeway and the car runs fine,
shifts fine, stops fine (owner said he had brakes inspected when he
had new tiers - Michelins - installed) and sounds fairly &quot;tight.&quot;

The owner blew the old engine and had the replacement - a GEX -
installed by a local mechanic, along with the clutch.

I'm going to pass on this since I'm really looking for a Westie with
&quot;good everything&quot; but engine.

Now you know as much about this vehicle as I do.
