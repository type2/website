Fellow listees,

I am planning on doing my first valve adjustment sometime this week on my 
Riveria. I am going on a trip this weekend and thought I would double check 
a few things before departing. I was just wanting to confirm the size of the 
gap on the valves for a type 4 1800cc with dual carbs. I know a type 1 is 
.006&quot; but I just wondered if it is the same on the type 4. Also is there 
anything else I should be looking for while I'm under the bus?

cheers...
Jeff
