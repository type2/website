Subject: [T2] Body shop in NY

Hello all,

Are there any listees in the Southern Tier region of NY or Northern PA that 
can give me the name of a good body shop?  I have searched high and low for 
someone to do the left rear corner of my bus so that I can put a taillight in 
(and have it stay there without the aid of duct tape) and to put the new 
floor in my Bug.  No takers so far...  I am in the Binghamton area of NY.
