Dave,

I installed 50 watt, turn signal,brake light, and running lights, in my
GL, but the reflector area is larger on it than the T-2, and I would
almost bet the higher wattage bulbs would melt something, pretty quick.

However, I did install halogen back-up bulbs which aren't on that long,
and do brighten up the rear nicely, without adding any &quot;hang on&quot;
accessory lamps to the rear of Clementine.  

I have the bulb numbers and prices if you are still interested----I just
have to dig them out, from wherever I put them for safe keeping.
   

Later,
