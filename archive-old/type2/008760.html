&gt; Hi Shannon
&gt; I'm not sure of the name, think it's maybe Graco, but it's a booster
seat that
&gt; the 
&gt; child sits on and an arm comes down on the childs lap.Can only be
used with
&gt; lap
&gt; belts. Seen it alot in childrens second hand stores but I'm sure its
available
&gt; new.

I used these booster seats with both of my daughters.  They are a lot
easier to use than the &quot;bucket&quot; seats.  The children liked them
better, too, as they had better visibility.  They are also a _lot_
more compact and transfer from vehicle to vehicle seamlessly.  They
work with all kinds of seatbelts.

My children have topped the magic 40 pound mark and therefore can
dispense with booster seats.  Happy day!
