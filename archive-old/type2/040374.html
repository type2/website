By flipping the ring gear, the only part of the tranny that runs backwards
is the output.  All the gears run as intended.  Some years ago a trick to
running a &quot;backwards&quot; engine such as a Corvair was to flip the ring gear
in the VW transmission, but this meant that _all_ the gears were running
backwards, not a good thing.
