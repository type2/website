it can be done in the bus, but after doing it both ways I highly
recommend just pulling the engine. Makes it even easier to replace
those fuel lines &amp; check the whole engine also. I would also add the
Bentley to your reading collection. It's by far the most accurate of
the books as far as not being general.

&gt; question for you guys, is there a head gasket i need to replace, i
&gt; havent found any info. stating ther is a head gasket?????? also ANY
&gt; advice on pulling the motor would be very appriciated.

There was a gasket (soft metal ring) that was inserted between the
cylinders &amp; heads. Many years later VW issued a bulletin that
essentially said &quot;you don't need them, just make sure you make up the
shim difference w/ under cyl shims&quot;. My thought on this is. If you
pull the heads &amp; the gasket is there, put a new one back in. otherwise
don't worry.
