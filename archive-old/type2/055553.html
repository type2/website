&gt;Also, if it is a 60 and a bastard 40hp. should there be a hole in the apron
&gt;for a crack to start the motor??

The crank start apron ended with the 36hp.  Many people have told me that 
they ended in '58, but on my 3 early '59s that were 36hp/split case tranny 
they all had crank start aprons.

36 hps and cranks were used to chassis # 269 447, May 19th 59.     As it is a
mid year change, and often that confuses people.  VW made many changes at
times other than the model year, which is why I like to use VINs to be more
specific.  So- some 59 had cranks(36hp motors) and some didn't , so some had
split case trannies, and some didn't.   

The 'modified 36hp motor (bastard 40hp) was used through June 60 VIN 614 455
if I have it right.
