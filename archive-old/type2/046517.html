Subject: Re: [VB] Oktoberbus (Midwest Version) now Bustober Fest

 Due to the prior existence of a U.S. Octoberbus (in N.C.) we are changing 
the name of our event to &quot;Bustober Fest&quot;.  Hopefully no one's using this name 
already!   ;-)

&lt;&lt; The K.C. Kombi's campout is now called &quot;Bustober Fest&quot; and will be held at 
the 
 Indian Cave State Park located on the river bluffs overlooking the Missouri 
 River in southeast Nebraska.  This will be the weekend of 
 October 27,28, and 29th.  It's about a two hour drive north of Kansas City.  
 Erin (No Quarter) and the Missouri, Nebraska, Iowa, and Kansas busers will 
 all be 
 there.  The KC Kombies along with a number of Nebraska bus folk are 
 sponsoring this campout.  The campground has hiking, biking, caravan to 
local 
 historic sites, plus all the usual camping fun and games.  Campground has a 
 group use area with shade trees, picnic tables, fire rings for campfires, 
pit 
 toilets next to campsite, but no electrical hookups.  There are offsite 
 showers and water in the park.  For more information, call Pink Newell at 
 (816) 587-2838 or email at pinknewell_at_aol_dot_com
