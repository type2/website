&gt;&gt; Does anyone happen to know the nut size for the studs that go from the head

&gt; I just picked up some Stainless Steel nuts (8mm) for this same thing. I
&gt; couldn't find anyone that carried all-metal lock nuts so I opted for the
&gt; all-metal stainless steel nut w/ lock washer. Has held great so far.

They are indeed M8.  The usual head size for M8 is 13mm, but 12mm is also
available.  The best self-locking nuts I have found are Aerotight stiff
nuts, which are available in stainless.  Don't ask me where you can get them
in the States though.
