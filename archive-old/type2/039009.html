Subject: Re: Camping Stool Needed---I have one

    I picked up one of these at the Irvine Meadows show last year.  I always 
wanted one, but so far it's just collecting dust, and I doubt that I'm ever 
going to use it.  I believe that this is out of a '78, with 
green/chocolate/black plaid.  It's in decent shape, snap and straps intact, 
NO WASTEBASKET.  Best offer, I'll pay shipping (as long as I at least break 
even).  PLEASE don't reply that you'll beat any offer, as I'm not comfortable 
getting into a bidding war.  If anybody wants it, just offer whatever it's 
worth to you.  Thanks!

Matt Q.  '77 Westfalia (non-deluxe)

P.S.  OH YEAH---My bus and I are headed south of the border tomorrow for a 
week of Baja camping.  I won't be able to return e-mail til probably Tuesday 
the 9th.
