Subject: [VB] Friday: John Muir Idiot Guide documentary

Hello group,

I am working on a documentary film titled &quot;The Original Idiot&quot; about
John
Muir's book: How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive, A Manual of Step by Step
Procedures for the Compleat Idiot.  The film has been in production for
a
year now, and I plan to wrap it up by September 2003.

Part of the film's purpose is to illustrate the motivating ideas behind
the
DIY movement, showing why many people chose to do their own technical
work.
This book's open sharing of specialized information helped liberate and
empower people to move away from commercial dependence toward
self-reliance.

This March I will travel from New York to Mexico to collect interviews.
I hope to fit some VW rallies into the schedule to meet people, but if
any
of you have stories, perspectives, or attitudes regarding this manual I
would love to try to schedule personal meetings (in most cases, an
informal
half-hour video interview will do.)

There were also versions of the &quot;Idiot's Guide&quot; published in the Spanish
and
German languages.  If anyone has a copy of either, and particularly if
they
can speak the language, I would be extremely grateful for an opportunity
to
come record your take on the book (regardless of location).

Thank You,
Sean Solowiej
