&gt; So my questions, installation direction? The outer part of the CV has one
&gt; groove on one side, and three on the other, also the inner part has a ridge
&gt; on one side (looks almost like a washer) and is flat on the other. So which
&gt; side faces the boot? (the inner part with the ridge is on the same side as
&gt; the single groove on the outer part)

The single groove goes on the outside (near the stub axle, transmission
flange).

&gt; Also, so I only have to go under the bus once I am setting up the new CV's
&gt; on the axles off my spare parts bus ('74 1.8L model). I am assuming they are
&gt; the same, and the length left to right is the same??? (It's a manual trans).
&gt; Thanks for your help.

I think 73-79 are the same.
