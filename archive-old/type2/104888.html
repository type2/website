Subject: FI Pressure Regulator

Smelled a bit of fuel and peeked around, found this on my '79:

http://www.volks-web_dot_net/bus/wonder/

It appears that I have fuel (not a lot) loose around the pressure
regulator.  It looks like it's equally on both sides of the
regulator...  Has my regulator gone?  Do these clamps work loose?

I had all fuel lines replaced about 2 years ago when one of the injector
hoses sprung a mist, at a shop in Gilroy that I thought rocked.  Did
they likely not replace ALL the hoses?  Guess I should do that now? 
Seems like if they did I shoulda got a bit more mileage out of it.

&quot;I replace the FI fuel line with Mercedes EFI fuel hose. It is 7.5mm.   
2
to 3 meters should do all except the 10mm hose between the pump and
filter.
The Mercedes hose clamps work just like the original VW clamps.&quot;

Do I really need to replace the clamps?  Are these original?  They look
okay to me... 

Guess I could tighten it all up and see if it's still leaking, but I'm
paranoid and would rather do it all if there's any reason to do so.

Thanks, wise listees!

Teri
