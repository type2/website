Subject: Re: [T2] 72-79 Pickups' rarity

With the market saturation and dominance of Ford/GM/Dodge pickups in the US 
market, VW decided not to import the cab version T-II's of this era. Far 
more than twice as rare as a standard transporter, they tend to bring 2 to 
3 times the money of a similar condition loaf. The ones you see in the US 
came from Canada or Germany or another country of origin.

&gt;How come 72-79 pickups are so rare in the United States--or is it just me? 
&gt;I'd love to find a doublecab especially, but this seems impossible. I'd 
&gt;just like to know why these are so hard to find.
