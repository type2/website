Subject: Re: [T2] truckers, buses, PLF

When I had the '67 I used to keep a orange triangle the is used for 
ag vehicles in the rear window. It was quite bright when its 
reflective material was hit by the headlights of other cars. I have 
since found out that it is illegal in NC to run that on a tagged 
vehicle going over 25 mph. I was never pulled for it though.

&gt;After reading this thread, I was toying with adding something to ours.
&gt;Maybe a set of those NightRider lights that sequence back and forth, mounted
&gt;in the window either horizontally across the top or vertically on both
&gt;sides?
