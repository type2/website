&gt;  but do you guys forsee any problem with this?

if you drive in cold enough weather the condensation will freeze inside the
intake and your motor won't run. this is the classic problem with the
central carb on a bus. the intake runners are so long that the velocity of
air in the runners causes this condensation effect.

if you look at a stock upright motor (all aircooled bugs, all busses prior
to 1972) you will see how VW dealt with this, by creating a manifold
preheater circuit, where hot exhaust gasses are diverted to a runner beside
the intake manifold under the carb and then back into the muffler. this
keeps the intake charge warm and prevents the condensation from occurring.

in your application, i have heard of people using a flexible 12v heating
element wrapped around the runners to heat them. apparently it works, but
i've never seen one set up this way.

the central carb is not the best choice, there are many better options,
especially if you live in an area where it gets below freezing more than a
few times a year. but if you deal with the condensation problem, they are
workable.
