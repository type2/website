Subject: Re: [T2] Rust removal

Hiya All,

I've stumbled onto this thread concerning rust removal and POR 15.  I have 
used POR 15 and have only good (and cautionary) things to say about it.  First 
off......how to apply.
Restomotive recommends that the area in question be thoroughly cleaned with 
their Marine Clean.  Follow that with an application of their Metal Ready.  
Following these two products comes the coat of POR 15.  To be honest, I've seen 
others' comments concerning shortcutting the steps above or using other 
products in the prep.  EVERYTHING I've heard and seen contradicts that approach.  
Follow Restomotive's instructions to the letter.
POR-15 actually adheres better to slightly rusted surfaces.  More &quot;tooth&quot; for 
it to grip.  However, it is not a good application for exterior &quot;showing&quot; 
surfaces on two counts.  It dries to a rock hard surface.  Very difficult to 
smooth or feather.  Terry's approach (the traditional body shop technique) is MUCH 
better in this situation.  POR 15 also will not hold its color (usually 
black) when exposed to UV rays.  It must be topcoated and that needs to occur while 
the base coat of POR 15 is still tacky/wet.  The stuff is great however, 
under the vehicle where rust is a common problem.
Finally, POR 15 is an isocyanate.  VERY dangerous stuff.  A proven cancer 
causer.  If you decide to use POR 15 treat it with a healthy respect.  That means 
gloves, protective clothing, a mask, good ventilation - the works.
