Lisa,

I would say your sender is going bad and needs to be replaced.  There are 2 
ways to replace it: 1) Cut a hole in the sheet metal forward of the engine 
large enough to remove it and install a new one.  2) Lower the engine enough 
to get the gas tank out.  I've never tried the first method, but there 
should be something in the archives about it.  Lowering the engine isn't too 
bad, except you have to remove any engine stuff that sticks up too far and 
you need a good floor jack.

Good Luck,

Ray
