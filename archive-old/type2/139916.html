&gt; Ok, my starter is turning too SLOW to start. I'm about to pop in a new
&gt; battery and new cables. Somewhere I read that the ground strap on the
&gt; Tranny may be loose. I'm wondering if it would be advantagous to get a
&gt; negitive battery cable with two leads. One lead to the chasis where
&gt; it's at by factory default, and one line to the engine/tranny for
&gt; direct ground to the battery.

I recently totally replaced all the high voltage cables, for the battery
cables I used 2 gauge boat battery cables,  made em up myself and I did
indeed put two ground cables in, one to the standard ground point the
other was run to the bolt under the coil. (78 FI 2liter)

what an amazing difference!!!

but not cheap, total cost for a dual battery system and a cut out switch
was over $150   and I made them up myself.  got the stuff from &quot;Boat USA&quot;
not the cheapest place in town.
