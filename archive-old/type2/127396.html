Subject: Looking for a hightop near Arizona

Subject says it all.  I kinda have the hightop
bug.  It must be the style that allows for a full
bed up top, in other words not the style that has
the cut out in the back for luggage like the ones
on the second row of hotdog's website
http://www.72camper_dot_com/hitops.htm

Anyone have one?  I may also have a late westy
top-- but not the bed mechanism-- available if I
find a hightop.  

Thanks,
Ray
