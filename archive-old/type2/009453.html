I have a Frankendizzy that I have put together for my '76 2.0 liter. I 
looked up the number once upon a time, and found that it was not from a 
bus engine. That should dissuade me, but I am convinced that anything is 
better than a 009.

What makes it particularly monstrous is that I bought a tune up for it as 
though it were the stock dizzy. That would have a square hole for the 
contact out of the condensor, but the distributor I have has a round 
hole. So I got out a knife and pared it down. Then I found that I 
couldn't swing the thing through enough of a rotation to set the timing, 
so I moved the condensor under the rear cap clip.

So here are the questions:

1. In one photograph somewhere in Bentley or Haynes, it looks as though 
there is a little metal retainer screw on to the side of a dizzy, holding 
the lead in place. Since my little paring operation is imperfect, I am 
worried that the lead will shake loose and short out. If I had bought the 
correct condensor for this dizzy, would it have come with a clip/clamp? 
Is there such a thing on distributors with round lead holes?

2. The vacuum advance is a dual. Is it sufficient to run a hose from the 
retard side of the can over to the center plenum?

3. Are advance curves so different from application to application that I 
would be wise to chase this thing into a windmill and torch it?
