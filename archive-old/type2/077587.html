Subject: More info about Electric busses

Here is some more info about converting your bus to electric.

http://www.electroauto_dot_com/kits.html

They have a basic kit for $4,000 and a deluxe kit for $4,700. They claim to
have already created adapter plates for the transmission for a bus &quot;up to
79&quot;. This is not a turn key system, some welding and design work has to be
done (200 + man hours). I was not sure if anybody has posted this link
already, but I just found it and thought I would share it.

They do have a complete turn key system for the rabbit and the 914 Porsche.
Both about $8,000 (40 - 60 man hours)
