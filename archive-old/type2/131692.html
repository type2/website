Subject: Re: [T2] Middle Bench mounts

Hi Folks,

Do Westfalia conversions have the middle seat mount under the plywood floor? 
  Or did VW not install them for vans that were slated for conversion?  If 
the mounts aren't there, is it possible to simply bolt thru the floor (with 
proper rustproofing), or is the sheet metal too weak to support the seat in 
case of an accident?

I've been thinking about installing a middle seat now that my sink cabinet 
is out...

Thanks!
