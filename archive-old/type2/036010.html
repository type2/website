take a screwdriver and short across both brake switches it is possible for 
one to be bad and they work diferent sides. Your tail light works because its 
on a different circuit so that really dosn't mean anything. The left side is 
piggybacked off the right side meaning power comes from the right side so a 
good guess is either, bad bulb (remember it has 2 elements), bad brake light 
switch, or a broken lead where it t's to feed the left side. I would start at 
the brake switch, if you cross it and get light you've solved the problem.
