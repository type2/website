Well i finally got up the guts to buy a mig.. bought a lincoln sp-125 plus, a
BIG bottle of compressed Argon, a regulator, and a Shademaster self-adjusting
mask. My total expenses were a bit under $1100. I also picked up an angle
grinder and a whole lot of vice grip clamps.  My first welds (on scraps)
looked pretty bad, but the more i play, the better they look.  Its actually
pretty fun!  I am replacing some beetle sheet metal before i actually take
this sucker toward any splitty!  so first its a 74 beetle, then the 1966
westy..
