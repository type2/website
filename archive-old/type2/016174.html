Your seat should swivel.  Open the door, sit in the seat, pull up on the
small rod between your legs, (no, no the other one :), and swivel toward the
drivers seat.  It's easier to swivel if you are sitting in the seat, but
with a little WD-40 or silicone you can get the seat to swivel without
sitting in it. Good luck.

Hey listemembers!

Well, I sold the first bus I ever owner, the 75 standard hotwheel edition, 
and I hate myself for it.
But, I needed to, because I bought a 76 westfalia and needed both the money 
and space. I have only had the 76 since it has been pretty ugly out and I 
have not done much with it yet, and was figuring out all the little toys and

such.

Does my passenger seat swivel? If so, how?
It doesn't have a back to it, like the 75 did, so it makes sense, I just 
don't really understand how to swing it around.

ahhh, its nice dealing with such little things like this.

Christopher
76 westfalia - needs a name still.
