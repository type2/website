yes, you can check full centrifugal advance by disconnecting the vac hose
and run to 3500 then put your timing light on it, you should have about
30-32 degrees.

&gt; John C writ:
&gt; &quot;a stock distributor from 1976-1983 has 32 total at WOT, 42-45 at part
&gt; throttle cruise (read the Bentley manual if you doubt me).&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Just to clarify, it is possible to time the vacuum advance with vacuum
&gt; disconnected and plugged at 32 degrees at 3800RPM..?  Then test the
results
&gt; with the vacuum attached and you should read 45ish degrees at part
throttle?
&gt;
&gt; That just seems like a lot of advance to me, but hey if it works go with
it.
&gt; I will read up in the Bentley tonight to see their timing process...  So
&gt; much different than the T1 vacuum advance :)
&gt;
&gt;
