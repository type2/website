 So....If yours is getting kinda shbby looking REPLACE it. &gt;&gt;

I always carry a fire extinguisher.  In MHO they are very inexpensive 
insurance.  I've never used one on any of my vehicles, but I've seen cars 
burn to the ground.  It is not a pretty sight.  I recommend everyone buy fire 
extinguishers.  One for each vehicle and one for the kitchen.
