Subject: '83 Tranny stuck in second

Well.  My  83 vanagon tranny got stuck in second.  To make a long story
short I found the linkage  to be OK, so I took the tranny out an delivered
it to the local experienced mechanics.  They took the lid off and got it
freed up but they couldn't find anything wrong, so nothing to fix and no
guarantee that it won't happen again.  So I'm a bit stumped about what to do
next.  I do a three hundred mile run every two weeks and hate to think of
getting stuck out there in the world again.  I have a line on two junk yard
boxes for $500 ea. and rebuilts run around seven hundred.  What to do what
to do???
