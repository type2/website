Hi all,

My bus is running great now--turned out my recently installed head was not
damaged and Mark Hineline was correct that my head just needed to be
re-torqued.  Dropped the engine  and torqued the head  set valves Type IV 
set points, timing.  My bus is running better than ever! I am excited.

Also today I bought a '86 Jetta with 160K miles in really good shape for
$1550.  This makes me somewhat sad and somewhat glad.  I am going to China
for six weeks leaving on Saturday so the driving part of my summer is
largely over.  Desiring a vehicle with a heater which I could commute in
with snow and ice with no ice scraper on my dashboard and minimal extra
clothing I bought this Jetta.  So now my bus is for sale. Please don't
write and tell me about how awesome your bus isin the snow and ice.  One I
won't believe you and two that is your bus with some souped up heating
system and three would likely be based on your Kansas (flat)driving
experiences. 

I'm selling the bus which is a '79 Kombi with Westy interior (no poptop)
Z-bed, closet, backward chair, upper storage shelf and the icebox and sink
unit which is not installed.  The type IV 2.0 liter is running great as
listed above.  Mileage is unknown as I got it from a guy who got it from
an alcoholic lady who apparently didn't provide very straight answers.
Almost forgot linoleum floor! and the table and the light above it.  and
the window screens.  She apparently said it was rebuilt twice though she
didn't have any receipts.  Runs greatthough.  Just recently did- all
exhaust gaskets, valve cover gaskets oil cooler seals, new rings and AVP
head on the left side  a new alternator and new wiring for all of the
charging system including the Bosch Cold-start relay. Almost new tires.
Persfect condition child cot and am/fm cassette dect and Gene Berg
Shifter.  Everything works but the gas gauge is a little funny.  Body has
no serious rust but has a fair amount of surface rust which was treated
what looks like some years ago with POR-15.  Right now it is dark brown
with a three-line yellow pinstripe job and a black spare tire cover on
the front. Has a few dents but nothing huge.  I've spent some good money
on this bus and would settle for breaking even--$2300.  It is in great
mechanical condition and an owner that would fix up the body and paint
this bus would be greatly appreciated.

Call me at 360-459-8167 if you want to see it.  Thats Olympia, Washington.
I doubt I will have time to sell it before China and so will likely be
selling it from Pullman, WA in late August.  I'll post to the group when
that happpens if anyone is interested in this.

I can't thank you guys enough for all your help and your miraculous
long-distance diagnosis of my various situations.  I've learned an amazing
amount and much of this would not have been possible without the list.
Thanks again! and again!

P.S.  To any newbies out there --FLAPS doesn't stand for F--ing
 Lousy Auto Parts Store and that chick named TIA doesn't really have a bus
in as bad a shape as it sounds like.  Just hoped to increase the learning
curve of any one like me out there.

P.P.S.  Don't worry. I am almost positive that I will be a bus owner again
and then I will definately be coming back to the list.  You probably
haven't seen the last of me.
