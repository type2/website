  &quot;      My opinion is this.  If you have a new upright, I would run 10w30
in Winter, maybe 10w40 or 20w50 in the Summer.  If you have a worn upright
(like all mine), I would run 30wt in Summer and 10w30 in Winter.   If you
have a type 4, which I have no experience on, I would use the most
expensive oil I could find (synthetic 20w50) for a new engine and maybe run
something cheap and thick for a worn one (30wt).&quot;

Gents-

With all due respect to those who's opinions are dear to them.  I just read
an article in an import repair trade magazine, written about some tests
Mercedes did on oils and viscosities of various ranges.  It appears that
there research indicated that the 10 weight variety oils are relatively
worthless in the normal operating environment.  They found the best overall
performer was good 'ole
30 weight.......yep.  I was reading this article and shaking my
head...remembering all the info by Muir in his book....I thought darn this
cat was really right. And now Mercedes engineers have proved it.  The did
say that 20 weight is much better than a 10 weight mix, but the very best
was a straight 30 weight......So,  In my humble opinion......(Only allowed a
Mechanic to touch my bus twice in 10 years) and never have any
problems.......Listen to Muir.  Mercedes says it's true.

Forever Forward,
James &quot;Top Jimmy&quot; Dimmer
