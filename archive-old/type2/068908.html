&gt;I'm curious- thought 2l engines (FI) had special contacts in 
&gt;distributor to let brain know timing relative to injectors- how 
&gt;did you get an 009 to work?

No, the type 4's (411, 412) had such a distributor, but the type 
2's with type 4 motors used a completely different fuel injection 
system which allows the use of a conventional distributor.  You can 
use a 009 in a bus, but you must time the motor based on the 
distributor that is in it, so it would be timed the same as a 
beetle motor (I forget just what that spec is).  Theoretically the 
009 has a slightly different advance curve than the vacuum-advance 
distributor used in a bus, but in actual use I have not noticed a 
difference in performance.  The 009 is much cheaper, however.
