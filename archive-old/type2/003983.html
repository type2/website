&gt; Hey Eric,
&gt;
&gt; Just changed pads on my 72 Westy yesterday which had the same symptoms.
&gt; Stuck piston on right caliper. There is an article in the library
describing
&gt; a couple of methods to deal with this. one involves the use of  air
pressure
&gt; to loosen the piston. There are also several relevant posts in the
&gt; archieves. I think I used searchwords &quot;caliper stuck&quot; . If you are
&gt; successful in loosening the piston, be sure to check for leakage
afterwords
&gt; as the cyliders can become rusted and pitted,  effectively destoying the
&gt; seal. Rebuild kits and rebuilt calipers are available.
&gt;
&gt; Good Luck!
&gt; Rich Patano
&gt; 72 Westy
