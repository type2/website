&gt; 3. Tachometer- I'd like to get a tach so I can see how many rpm's I'm pushing 
&gt; on the free way.  The instrument  panel has a blank hole in it on the right 
&gt; side, but I haven't seen any guages to fit it-also, i'd like the tach to be 
&gt; pretty cheap and easy to install-any ideas?

--&gt; I bought one of the cheap J.C. Whitney ones.  It's a lighted tach with
an adjustable redline pointer.  It didn't cost me very much...maybe $30, I
think.  I removed the metal plate covering the hole to the right of the
speedometer, cut a hole in it, mounted the tach in the hole, then mounted
the plate back in the dash.  It looks pretty good.  If you want more of a
stock look, for two or three times the price you can get a VDO tach that
fits precisely in the hole in the dash and matches the other gauges.

Hooking up the tach is the easy part.  There's one wire you hook to
somewhere that gets 12V when the ignition is on, one ground wire, one wire
you hook to the gauge lighting circuit, and one that you hook to the
points side of the ignition coil.  If you get the J.C. Whitney one,
there'll also be a switch to tell it whether you have 4, 6, or 8
cylinders.  That's it.
