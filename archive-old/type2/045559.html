Subject: Re: [T2] Hydraulic lifters for '75 1.8...question

You can get a set of MELLING hydraulic lifters at Auto Zone for around
$36.00 or so, at least thats what they are in S.C. A lot cheaper than
$15-18.00 each for  German. I am putting a set into my '77 engine as
soon as weather permits.

Chris.
