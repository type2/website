&gt;I was told by a local shop here that a sunken valve seat isn't rebuildable.
&gt;Is that true?

When I was looking to buy the '80 with the bad valve seat (the guy 
selling it could never find the time to sell it to me, I bought an 
'87- that was last week) I called all around to see about getting it 
repaired or replaced.
One shop said it was junk and I'd need a new one, another said they 
could do it but were booked up for 3 weeks, another said maybe 
depending on the head but they did have a rebuilt one on the shelf for $250.
 From all that I guess it depends on the shop &amp; the condition of the head.
