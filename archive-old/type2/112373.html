Subject: Re: [T2] mar-hyde one-step primer

Hi Robert,

I used one-step extensively when I worked over &quot;Bob The Tomato&quot;. I was 
quite pleased with the results.

2.5 years later I have yet to see any of the areas treated with 
one-step rust through my cheap Maaco paint.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; I have a number of places on my exterior body where I'm getting bad 
&gt; surface rust. This Mar-hyde stuff is supposed to convert rust to 
&gt; primer sealer. I thought I'd use it to arrest the rust until I can get 
&gt; to a paint job. The instructions indicate that you remove loose scale 
&gt; and paint, and paint this stuff directly over the remaining rust.
&gt;
&gt; The guy at my FLAPS said he had good results using it and recommended 
&gt; it.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks.
