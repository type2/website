Subject: Re: 'rescue' of Joel's double cab

Hey, if it counts for anything, I consider this to be a full fledged 
rescue. Any time you travel any appreciable distance, or renovate any 
vehicle that's not in current use, or do a major renovation to a 
deteriated vehicle... then that counts into my terms of a rescue.

&gt;From what I've seen, all 3 apply in this case. Here's a vehicle sitting 
with a bad engine (1). You are traveling across state lines for the 
purposes of bringing it home (2). You are going to intall an engine, and 
other non-incidental work, into bringing it online as a working vehicle 
(3).

It this ain't a rescue, then I'll go soak my head in a bucket of suds.

Hmm... on second thought, maybe I'll do that any way.
