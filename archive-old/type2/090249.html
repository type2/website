Subject: Re: [T2] breadloaf shocks?

Isnt that the word on the gas ones. stiff? Ive got the Boges from depot
and I will try something else next time around.


&gt; &lt;&lt;  I like my KYB's but my arse doesn't...Not much besides
&gt; &gt; a Recaro can cure that sittin' on the wheel feelin' when
&gt; &gt; the road gets rough...
&gt;
&gt; Tony
&gt; Which KYBs are they?
&gt;  &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; KYB gas...Handling is almost good (bigger sway bar, too)...
&gt; But I'm prejudiced; one of my other cars is a Bugeye...
&gt; WE hafta look UP to see Mini's...
