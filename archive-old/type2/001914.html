Subject: Air cooled vanagon need help
Date: Sat, 2 Sep 2000 07:51:57 -0400
Organization: Microsoft Corporation

I just put a rebuilt (new) 2liter in my vanagon, and coming home from the
shop it had no power.  It ran hot, and it has dual Weber 34's on it.

I believe that the timing is set at about 8 degrees BTDC.   Should this be
different since it is carbureated and not fuel injected?  The acceleration
seemed kinda slow as well.....................considering I had a ragged out
engine that was running on 3 cylinders prior to this that had more power.
Any help/suggestions would be appreciated.
