Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] How much gallon of paint for a split

 When I got my '65 westy painted, it was half a gallon of white, and half a gallon of green.   This was painting the outside and the dash, no engine compartment or anything else. 
  Painted the white.  
 Then taped it off and painted the green.  
 
 Probably should have painted it all green and then white over it on the top as per VW, but I didn't.
