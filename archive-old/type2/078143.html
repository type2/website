&gt; Does anyone on the list have any negative or positive

&gt; piston/cylinder kits produced by AA Automotive
&gt; Products in San Francisco?

&gt; I contacted Bernie Bergmann yesterday about
&gt; acquiring a set of big bore pistons/cylinders and he
&gt; has nothing but good things to say about these kits.

I'd ask a couple more engine builders about this supplier before spending
the money.  Bergmann doesn't have a sterling reputation himself.
