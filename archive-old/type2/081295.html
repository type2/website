Subject: Re: [T2] rubber hoses in engine compartment


&gt; VW sold me some hose clamps which you use an older &quot;CV&quot; joint clamp
&gt; tool on to cinch it down.
&gt; Is it better to use mini hose clamps or the dealer's hose and hose clamps
for this job?

Do NOT use wormdrive clamps with open slots in them, ala Gates, they will cut
thru the hose. Use the original VW clamps or Mercedes clamps.
Do NOT use regular fuel hose, i.e. Gates 5/16&quot;. Use 7.5mm fuel injection hose.
Don't forget the 4&quot; section of 10mm hose between the filter and pump....
If you do a search in the archives under 'fuel hose', you should find some of
my posts with Mercedes part numbers for the hose and clamps.
