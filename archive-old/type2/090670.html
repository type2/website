That's what I heard -- I also heard that metallics were more difficult to 
spray correctly because of how the little metallic specs in the paint lay 
different if you paint in a different direction.

&gt; Jennifer............. Take some advise from an old guy that has seen 
&gt; a lot. Don't paint your van a metallic color and don't use clear 
&gt; coat on your new paint job. Both are bad ideas. The metallics fade 
&gt; crack, the clear coats turn yellow and craze, sometimes coming off 
&gt; in sheets.
