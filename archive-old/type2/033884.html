Subject: Opinions on automatics (1973)

This is from a good friend. She knows nothing about busses. She thinks I do. 
:-)

Anyway, anyone want to respond to her questions about autotrans? 

Answers should be sent to her not to the list. You might not get a response 
but will prove what an asset this list is to the new bus owner.

Sent responses to her, not the list at:

 What do you know about vans with automatic transmissions--I have a friend
 who has had a van before and is dying to get another.  She
 has found a '73 with automatic.  What do you think?  It has a little
 rust.  They want $1200.  Are these OK or to be avoided? &gt;&gt;
