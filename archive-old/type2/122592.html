&gt; Can I lift the engine by those two holes in the case - the one by the

&gt; 
&gt; Are those supports strong enough?

If you mean the hole right by the flywheel, I've lifted mine like that
before (complete engine) with no problems.  It balanced pretty well.  I
wouldn't leave it hanging on a rope too long though, just long enough to set
it down somewhere else.
