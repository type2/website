Subject: Re: [T2] New Member with a FrankenBus Timing Question

On your timing it sounds like the distrubtor drive
shaft is in the wrong position. Timing marks are very
simular on the T-2,T-4, and the 914 (looking through
the hole you have a white line and a red line on the
air turbine)at least on the rough set the T-4 &amp;
Porsche are tweeked at 3500 RPM to set the advance on
the distrubtors(red line on the air turbine), but they
all line up and time the same way for the valve
adjustments. Find # one TDC and line everything up
with it..If you can rock the air turbine do not start
the engine untill you have this tighened..The timing
marks are on the air turbine looking through the hole
on the air housing..    Phil
