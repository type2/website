Subject: Re: The GWB is gone...

Man, that sucks. I know how it feels. I once had a 1982 Pontiac TransAm. In 
this particular case, the body was in great shape, but the motor was bad, 
and the interior was pretty beat up. At that time in my life, I simply 
couldn't keep the car. Unfortunately, back in 1999, eBay was no where near 
as popular as it is now, and no one grabbed the car. So... I had it hauled 
off the to junkyard. I went back later that weekend to see it pretty much 
stripped and waiting it's turn to the crusher. Oh man... that hurt.

But... sometimes crap like this has to happen. There will be other cars. I'm 
not going to lie to you and say that the spirit of the GWB will live on in a 
new / different Bus simply because you kept the horn button or the bumper... 
but, you'll grow to like your next Bus just as much as you did this one... 
and you just have to remember the good times.... &lt;sniff&gt;

&gt; Soon I'll have another bus. But nothing will replace the Great White Bus.
