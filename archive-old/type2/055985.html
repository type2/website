Subject: Vacuum Advance Switch

List-
I'd like to add to Michael Harrison's questions from earlier today.
I have a '72 1.7L 2 carb Bus. I've been doing alot of tuning lately and the
Bus is running better than ever. However, setting the idle speed gets
confusing when I realize it has 2 idle speeds. One for neutral and one for
4th gear. If the Bus is sitting still and in neutral it idles fine, push it
into 4th (foot on clutch) and the idle goes way up. On my Bus the vacuum
switch is connected. Does this RPM change indicate that my timing is off?
It seems that the transmission switch sends power to the vacuum switch when
in 4th gear and this opens up the vacuum hose allowing more advance. When I
pull the wires off the vacuum switch the idle speed no longer goes up when
the shift lever is in 4th.
The manuals tip-toe around the idea of disconnecting any of the emission
devices. Would the Bus run better if I removed the  switch and connected
the vacuum hose directly to the distributer? What would the timing then be
set to?
Thank you,
John Ingram
