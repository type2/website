Subject: Re: [T2] Accelerator cable

Hey Tom,
    just looked at the one I pulled out of my 70 and it has a regular clevis 
end on it. ( circle with open end) pretty sure the one I replaced it with was 
the same. Pretty simple job, unhook carb end, remove belly pan and unhook 
cable. Pull to the front, check to make sure their the same length. Hit the 
new cable with drislide or like lubricant, only hard part is mating the cable 
from the boden tube to the tube in the fan housing. Bolt it up and go.
