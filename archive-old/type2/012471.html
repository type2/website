Hi David,

Don't get us started...  I wonder if they would
consider having a Mercedes diesel Polo pop top camper
follow them back over. ha. ha.  The choices they have
over there sure make some of us want to get into the
importing business.  I know there are some web pages
that tell you which vehicles are OK to import, but
I'll bet VW is the best source for all of this.  I've
heard VW won't respond unless the original owner
requests this information.

&gt; My folks will be retiring next year and moving from

&gt; bring their '94 Eurovan Westfalia to the States with
&gt; them.  It is a German-spec camper, 2.0 4-cylinder
&gt; 5-speed, &quot;California Coach&quot; model.  I have tried to
&gt; find out if/how it would be possible for them to
&gt; legally import this vehicle and basically come up
&gt; empty.  The actual shipping is already taken care of
&gt; - we're only interested in what it will take to get
&gt; the van legally registered.  They are sentimentally
&gt; attached to this vehicle and would probably not
&gt; flinch at spending a significant amount of money on
&gt; it if necessary.  If anyone can help, my parents and
&gt; I would sure appreciate hearing from you.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
