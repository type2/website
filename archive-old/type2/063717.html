[...brake job...]
&gt; Now putting the nut back on, I wonder about that.
&gt; V-Dub shop guy says &quot;hammer the thing on there with a sledgehammer like
&gt; there's no tomorrow&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Chilton says &quot;271 ft/lbs&quot;.  
&gt; 
&gt; I only have the  bottle opener tool and a ball peen hammer.  The left nut 
&gt; looks like it's on past 4 threads.  This one will have a long way to go for
&gt; that.

I have a breaker bar with the right socket, and a 6-foot cheater pipe.
Using this setup, I overtorqued the nut.  Hanging off the end of a
6' cheater pipe,  I guess I'm alot heavier than 160lbs!  I recommend
using a proper breaker bar and cheater pipe.  Don't want that wheel
falling off fron the nut being too loose or from the nut cracking
from being overtorqued!

        Good luck
