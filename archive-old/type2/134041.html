Subject: [F] Friday bus pic

Loooong ago I ran a record label (Rise Record) with poster artist 
Frank Kozik...  well, he promised every band he liked a record, and 
then wouldn't do the cover artwork, leaving me to deal with the 
fallout. Since I owned the rights to the name, I eventually told 
Frank we weren't partners anymore and gave him a push. Which didn't 
sit well, but Frank is a survivor and soon came back with his own 
label (Man's Ruin).
  What does this have to do with busses - besides the fact that I 
hauled bands around in mine? One of the bands Frank liked was called 
WORMHOLE, and he did the cover art for their LP; he must have done it 
just after our breakup, as the artwork features my van:

Correct right down to the tire cover!
