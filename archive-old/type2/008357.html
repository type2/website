Subject: Help Re: VIN # plates

While on this topic... Just the other day I bought a 66 type 1 for 
$400.00.  The guy had a title... but I could not find numbers in the 
trunk or on the chassie.  I bought it cause I had another 66 which 
needed a few small parts and the engine.
Well my question is: is there another place I may find the VIN #?
It would be a shame considering the body is solid.  The floor needs 
changed, work.Any help is gretly appreciated.Thank You, Joe
&gt;&gt;Every state (and presumably country) has procedures in place to clear
&gt;&gt;the title for a vehicle that you possess legally.  There is no reason
&gt;&gt;that I can think of to swap VIN plates unless the ownership of the
&gt;&gt;vehicle is questionable.&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The only reason I can think of is if the vehicle you posess is not 
&gt;legal to
&gt;&gt;drive in the US, like say a Mexican beetle or a Brazilian type II.&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;With the theft problem that we have, should we condone a practice that
&gt;&gt;is likely to result in more buses being stolen?&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I'm not saying I think it's ethical to sell VIN plates, but I think 
the
&gt;&gt;chances of a bus being stolen and having different VIN plates swapped 
&gt;in is
&gt;&gt;pretty remote.  Think about it - if the bus is nice enough to steal, 
it &gt;is
&gt;&gt;probably well known in the VW community already.  I don't see it 
&gt;happening
&gt;&gt;very often.
