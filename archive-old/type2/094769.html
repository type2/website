Subject: engine swap

i crashed my 72 westy the other week and instead of paying the money to get 
all the body work done i am thinking about buying another bus and swapping 
the engine. a friend of mine found a 70 or 71 bus(cant remember what year) 
and i was wondering if my engine would fit right? i have a 1700. then if i 
do get this new bus i will be grabbing any good parts off mine and if anyone 
in the southern cal area is interested in a 72 westy (cabinets gone and no 
sink/storage) body i will be taking offers. that is when i do get the other 
bus and take care of the job at hand. ill put more info up when i am ready 
to sell. but my main question is will my engine fit and what if anything 
should i be careful with. this being my first engine pull. i have a friend 
who will be helping me and he is more experienced than me so it shouldnt be 
too bad. Sorry for the long and kinda off the subject quote but im just 
trying to get things sorted out. thanks for any feedback
