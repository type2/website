Subject: Last call on good back seat for 1970 bus! Free!


Help me out, folks!

I don't have a place to store it, and I soon may be forced to do something . 
. . unpleasant.  It's got black basket weave cover with two or three small 
mends in the cover, springs and horsehair in good shape. Mounting hardware 
included.

Please help me find a home for it. I don't want to ship it, but I'll make 
any reasonable arrangements to get it to a new owner.

Thanks!

Bill
Portland OR USA
1970 bus
