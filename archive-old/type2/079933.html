&gt; IIRC the term &quot;microbus&quot; was never applied to Bays, but if you mean the fancy-trim model, those westies don't fall into that category.  (OTOH maybe they do, since 
&gt; they started with sunroof body shells?)

the &quot;microbus&quot; only meant the VW's with the 8 small roof windows (or on
the big buses &quot;Standee windows&quot;)
