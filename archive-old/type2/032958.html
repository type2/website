Subject: T2 Registry (was Re: list history)

&gt;Thom Fitzpatrick runs a registry for split window buses.  Because there
&gt;is a lot of cross-posting between the vintagebus list and the type2 list,
&gt;mentions of it turn up by times, but AFAIK (as far as I know), there are
&gt;not registries for bay window buses or for vanagons (volunteers? :-)

Andreas Plogmaker of the German Type 2 Baywindow Club maintains on on-line 
registry for the baywindow buses:
