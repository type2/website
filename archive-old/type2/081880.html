&gt; I'm probably going to try and install some aftermarket gauges, especially
an
&gt; oil temperature gauge, but for the time being, I'd like to be able to feel
a
&gt; little bit more confident that I'm not unknowingly abusing my engine.

Consider the Gene Berg Temp Sender ( $20 ).
Easy install ( dipstick ), no dash hack, it flashes the idiot lite.
