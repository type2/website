&gt;What the heck is a 'vacuum cap'?
===========================&gt;
I was sort of expecting this question.

These are small plastic &quot;caps&quot; used to slip on the end of electrical or 
pneumatic instruments to keep debris from entering them during shipment or use.

They are used on tubing runs to serve as a seal under vacuum or very low 
pressure applications.

They are also used to cap off vacuum lines, unused carburetor connections, 
etc. in automobiles.

JC Whitney part # 12AU9031B
$4.49 for a set 50 in various sizes

They always seem to find unusual uses from myself.
