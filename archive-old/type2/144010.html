Subject: Re: valve adjustment 

&gt;He pointed out that the gaps should never be larger
&gt;than .006&quot; no matter what position the cylinder was
&gt;in.

Sorry, not true! Adjust the valves on a type 4 engine
only at TDC on the firing stroke. If you adjust them
at the loosest point they will be too tight. Ask me
how I know.
