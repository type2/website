Subject: Newbie bus owner in Richmond VA looking for help

About a month ago I finaly found a bus in my price range, and I bought it on
an impulse. I've been looking for one forever, and was kinda looking through
rose colored glassed when I bought her. She needs some work, though, and I
want to learn to work on her myself, but &quot;How to Keep Your VW Alive&quot; is less
help than I thought it would be. I don't have much mechanical experience
(and not much money either), and I don't know where to start. If any of you
are in or close to Richmond, VA, and have some spare time one weekend, I'm
willing to provide beer and a meal (I make a mean lasagnia) if anyone can
come help me look her over and figure out what needs fixing. I'll do the
grunt work, I just need some experienced advice.
She's a 1975 Westy Automatic, and I've named her 'Gypsy'.
Here's a picture:

She's leaking oil, runs kind of rough, and has lots of duct tape on bits of
the engine. There are even hoses that don't seem go anywhere. I had such
high hopes when I bought her, but now I'm almost ready to cry.

Not afraid to get dirty, just don't know where to start,
Michelle
'75 Westy Automatic 'Gypsy'
