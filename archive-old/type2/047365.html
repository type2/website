Subject: [T2] poptop seal

I have a question for you all.  I ordered a new poptop seal for my 82 westy.
What I got does not look at all like what is on my poptop.  The cross
section of the shorter piece looks like a &quot;U&quot;.  The cross section of the
longer piece looks like the &quot;U&quot; with a bulb attached to one side of it.  Is
this correct?  Will this seal as well or better then the original?  Do I
need to use contact cement or something when I install these?  Thanks.
