Subject: Mysterious Post-Ignition Sounds

Hi All -
Here's a good one, I hope:  When I start up my 79 fuel-injected bus, I get a
strange sound immediately after my engine starts -- that is, as soon as the
engine catches, I hear this whirring/grinding sound (best description I can
muster) from the engine compartment that continues for approximately 2
seconds after ignition.  My initial thought is that it almost sounds as if
the starter keeps going briefly even though the engine has already started.
This doesn't happen every time however -- I haven't yet been able to gauge
any consistency, but it seems as if this happens more during the first (i.e.
coldest) starts of the day rather than the warmest.  Do these symptoms sound
familiar to anybody?  Thanks!
