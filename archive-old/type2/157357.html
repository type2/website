Subject: fuel injector seal dropped into intake

'78 2.0 F.I.
  My assistant (good that I can blame it on someone else) dropped a fuel injector seal into the intake. He &quot;thinks&quot; he may have vaccumed it out. However, the valve was open and methinks it may be stuck in the cylinder. If so, what are the repurcussions? Should I just start it and burn it up or might it cause some damage?
  Thanks!  -Chris
