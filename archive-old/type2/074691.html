Subject: Syn oil to regular oil- Dangerous?

Volks,
	I'm looking at a vanagon that all it's life has had a diet of Mobil 1 
Synthetic oil. Being on the  verge of owning this van, and seeing how 
EXPENSIVE synthetic motor oils are, I'm wondering if it really is necessary 
to continue using the synthetic stuff. The van already has 130K on it and 
I'm looking for another 75K or so from it (without a rebuild (yes, it is 
totally possible)). Does anyone out there have any experience with switching?
I guess I've just never been convinced of the advantages of the synthetic 
stuff; at least not convinced enough to go from about a buck a quart to 
almost 4 bucks a quart.
My &quot;head smarts&quot; are telling me to just bite the bullet and keep going with 
the synthetic, but my wife (and our one income and two children) are making 
me look into the possibility of doing it cheaper.
I always get ADVICE when I post to the lists, but what I really want is 
actual, real world, experiences. Of course, all responses, experience or 
otherwise, will be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Joel
