Subject: RE: [T2] Swapped alternator, lost parts

&gt; the little plug thing that covers the alternator tightening bolt,
&gt; 021-119-295 is what you want. BD used to have them but their
&gt;  part number seems corrupted. Call.

&gt; the fancy alternator tightening nut

Actually the listing is right; the full VW part number is actually 021 119
295 01C. The 01C suffix is simply a color code (01C denotes black). Not sure
why VW bothered to add a color suffix for this part, as to my knowledge
there were never any other color choices anyway.  (Hot pink, maybe? :-)

There is a section on deciphering VW part numbers on our Links/Resources
page:  &lt;http://busdepot_dot_com/links.jsp&gt;
