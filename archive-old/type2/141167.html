Subject: RE: [T2] bn4, bn6

	I have contacted Espar recently regarding their new units as a
heater of some sort is something that I need to get installed.  One thing to
keep in mind, is that they are saying their new units run on diesel or
paraffin only.  You would need to install a small tank to hold either of
these fuels.  I don't consider this to be a deal killer necessarily but it
is an added task to a project that will have a lot of items to take care of
already.  A small tank should do since they rated the usage at about 10 - 15
hours/gallon for the &quot;Airtronic 2.&quot;
	With the cost of the new units being what they are, I am looking
hard at the BN4 at this point.

&quot;Never regret. If it's good, it's wonderful. If it's bad, it's experience.&quot;

Webasto(sp) and Espar both make excellent units, they are mostly used by
truckers to keep their cabs warm when stopped.  they are in the $800-$1200
range depending on features
