&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; I cut a trip short because a front brake was
&gt; dragging.  The passenger side got hot enough to
&gt; smell the second time and we knew it was most
&gt; likely us, pulled over and put my hand on the
&gt; wheel and sure enough.  Having been through this
&gt; before in a bug I am assuming it is the rubber
&gt; brake line that has shut on the inside.  Napa
&gt; Auto Parts gave me what I think  are the wrong
&gt; hoses, one is shorter, and the other is longer
&gt; then what are on there.Part number 27301 is on
&gt; both boxes.  Is there a left and right, the old
&gt; ones look the same.  The Napa hoses have
&gt; different ends too (see pictures at links below
&gt; or p mail me).
&gt; Anyway, I am glad I decided not to make this
&gt; repair on the road. Experience has taught to
&gt; check for the right parts first.  Never assume
&gt; what they give you is the right one.  Someone
&gt; said parts are getting hard to find and this
&gt; proves it.  I think I will return these to the
&gt; local Napa and order from busdepot or somebody.
&gt; Please look at the pictures and tell me I'm
&gt; crazy.  It could be that someone put a different
&gt; front end on my bus too.  My repair manual sucks,
&gt; I need to get a Bentley.  Has anyone tried the
&gt; Bentley DVD?  Could you share a diagram with me?
&gt; Other wise I will buy one and share with all...
&gt; Thanks  Bunches
