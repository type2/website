Subject: Re:  [T2] ECU faulty?

&gt;I have good fuel pressure and spark at every plug.  The AFC unit 
&gt;seems in working order and turns the fuel pump on when the flap is 
&gt;opened and there is power to the fuel injectors, but no spray???
&gt;
&gt;Hmmm....

Wow. The exact situation that I am in and I have the same question.

The ECU is not grounding my injectors and they are not firing. I'm 
laboriously tracing each wire from the ECU plug, almost none of which 
agree with the circuit diagram given in Bentley.

I hope someone chimes in with an experience saying what problem was 
solved when the ECU was replaced.

Eagerly awaiting the answer
