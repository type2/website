Thanks, Chris, for the reply.   If all you made (gross) was $90 then maybe these
are better places to buy stuff than to sell.  Unless you didn't really sell
much.. But I guess you got the benefit of divesting yourself of a lot of what
might be considered junk as well as having a fun day (presumeably).  But a $40
dollar profit hardly seems worth even loading the stuff up....John Jensen in
