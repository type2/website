Subject: Temp sensor

I have a question answered before I run for parts.  I am testing out my FI
on my 76 Westy.  My thermo time switch is bad but my qeustion is about the
head temp sensor.  The Bentley says the resistence should be about 2500
ohms.  Well mine is at 3150 ohms.  Is that enough out of spec to replace it.
This is testing it dead cold.
