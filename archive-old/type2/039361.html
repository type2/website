&gt;The carbs are probably fairly old and seem to be

Could be a lot of things.  It could be binding because something is bent.
Could be the choke linkage (if present on your carbs).  You should
disassemble and inspect.  There should be no need for any lubrcation on the
shafts themselves.

&gt;Prior to rebuilding, cylinder 4 had low compression,
&gt;which I suppose could possibly indicate a carb problem
&gt;(e.g. running lean).

I am not intimately familiar with dellorto carbs but if they are a
one-barrel-per-cylinder design and can be adjusted individually, then yes
that may be a problem.  More likely though it is a valve train problem of
some kind.

&gt;The linkage has been so unreliable that I've been
&gt;tempted to not even bother balancing them with a
&gt;unisyn.  (I need to buy one)  Usually within one
&gt;fill-up I can open one side or the other a good 1/8&quot;
&gt;at the throttle adjustment screw before the other
&gt;throttle moves.  The engine will increase several
&gt;hundred rpm's, maybe 1,000.  Would this mean that the
&gt;closed-throttle side is necessarily running lean (and
&gt;hot,unbalanced, etc.?).

Unbalanced, maybe.  You can still adjust the carbs with a sloppy linkage
(although of course it should be fixed ASAP).  A Unisyn is nice but not
necessary.  Just pull on the throttle cable for the test instead of the
individual carb linkage.  They should open at exactly the same time with no
increase in rpm until both begin to open.

&gt;Should I tamper with the carbs or just throw them back
&gt;in and be greatful they're not broken yet?  I thought
&gt;it might be a good idea to blow out the jets, but
&gt;don't have reason to believe they're blocked.  Would I
&gt;have to open them up(carbs) to do that?  If opening
&gt;them is at all risky, I'd rather not right now.  I'm
&gt;trying to get my bus on the road. I will probably
&gt;check/adjust the jet and mixture screws by ear as a
&gt;minimum.

If you are in a hurry, then just put them on and make sure they are opening
in sync.  Also be sure that all four cylinders are firing properly,
otherwise you are asking for an engine meltdown.

When you get time, rebuild the linkage.  Before you take any long trips,
check that you have the proper main jet size.  If in doubt, go rich (large).
