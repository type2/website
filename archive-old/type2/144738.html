&gt; These are temporary cures at best, just a situation like this---
&gt; You'll probably have a hard time locating one on the interenet.
&gt; Take a ride to any NAPA dealer, and they'll mre than likely have one.

Just ask at any quickie oil change place.  That's what they use after they
strip out the customer's original plug.  They're hoping that the customer
will be deniably far away in either time or space before they find
out.
