Subject: Re: [T2] Multimeter fried?

There is nothing economical a TV Repair shop could do with a fried no-name
meter. Get one of the cheap Sunpro engine testers and you have a multimeter
that also does dwell and RPM. If you need instructions for a multimeter you
probably have no use for capacity, transistor testing and the like anyway.

Smoke from inside is a Very Bad Sign. You can't hurt a digital meter by
hooking it up backwards, but you can hurt it by setting it up for current
(&quot;A&quot; dial setting or lead sockets) and then putting it across an unlimited
current source (like your battery)
