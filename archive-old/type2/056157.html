I've been trying to get my '73 Westy back on the road.  I've had the carbs
rebuilt and went through Muir's entire tune-up procedure.  When she turned
over, and I was glad for that, there was this 007-like black smoke.  I asked
a friend who knows a little more than i about cars to help and we did the
whole procedure again.  We also checked the carb jets, the floats, the
volume control screws, the timing, the valves, the points, etc, etc...Still
we have a lot of excess fuel going out the rear end.  I checked the achives
and found a note about different sized/shaped volume screws, but that was
not the case.  Anyone have any suggestions?  Thanks in advance.
