This is just me now, but with a good starter motor with good solenoid
and a reasonably kept up engine you can get good cranking and starts
with a 450 A battery. My engines pop right over on my truck, trike, and
compressor, so I can't really compare them to yours.

What's everyone using as for battery rating (cranking amps) in there
Buses?  I bought one for the 67 Panel that was 450 CCA but seems weak.
I noticed Wal-Mart sale a Max something with 1000 CCA. Anyone had luck
with this?
