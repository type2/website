Rockler Woodworking and Hardware [formerly The Woodworker's Store] has
&quot;T-molding&quot; in their catalog.  It comes in a couple of widths and 4 colors.

Their website/online catalog is at :    www.rockler_dot_com

This is the only source I've been able to find after a very long search.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Sorry Andrew nothing yet. One person told us to look in a parts book but
they did not have the stripping that we need. Please let us know what you
find out.  &lt;&lt;
