Subject: Re: Speaker placement suggestions

I bought two 6&quot; blaupunkt speakers once for $20 at B.J.'s wholesale.  These are
mounted in the headliner, just south of the visors.  Then I ran two wires under
the headliner and side trim to the compartment under the z-bed.  In there i put
a budget brand box with two 8&quot;s.  It's a Mobile Authority brand &quot;thump&quot;.  $60
at the same store.  It's says it's a hatchback box, but the angle is right to
fit under the braces on the bed.  You have to remove the sheetmetal hood for
the rear heat(?) vent, but i plugged mine underneath anyway (also an excellent
stash spot, if you have something to stash).  Later I decided that I wanted the
box to face front, so I moved the braces out about 2 1/2&quot; each side.  Now the
box fits between the braces, and the small door on the front of the cabinet can
be opened for more sound.

    The best part of this setup is that I didn't cut any holes in the Westfalia
wood.  I put my own fabric on the headliner, so i didn't mind cutting it.  And
all of this stuff can be easily removed and put into another vehicle.  This way
if I have a winter car or another bus, I can just put the sound in the one I
drive more.

    And if you're going to put a lot of bass in your car, and drive around with
it bumping, please please please, fix the rattles.  Nothing is more annoying
than a car who's doors rattle when the radio's on.  And it makes you look like
a total dork.

    Ok then.
