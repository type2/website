Subject: Snow Tires?

Well the first snow arrived last night in western NY.  I am wondering about
the necessity for snow tires on a late model ('77) breadloaf.  I got to drive
it in the snow a little last year and remember it plodding along fine.  The
tires I now have on it are Sears Weatherhandlers that are in really good shape.
I have extra rims and would probably not buy the snow tires brand new.
Anyway, do most of you put snow tires on your busses (if you drive through
snow that is).
Just anticipating the winter ahead,
Brett
