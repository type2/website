Hmmm, perhaps you or someone other can id the M-Code stuff better than I.

VIN Plate#: 2612082320
Sticker on the Driver's door jamb Date of Manufacture: 11/70
Sticker VIN #:2612082320

I have removed quite a few beams and I am pretty certain this one hasn't
been removed or changed. Usually there is paint chipping damage at the seam
of where the beam plate meets the frame. It looks stock. I am going to check
that fuse box though.

As for my 1970 I should clarify. When I bought it, it had a 68 front beam
which was a horrible hack job. The plate was modified with someone's idea of
&quot;welding&quot;. Not to mention that the steering geometry was off and the brakes
sucked. Last week finished replacing the beam with a 79 unit that I was
using for disc parts for my 68 DC project. Now my 1970 handles, brakes and
rides much nicer. I'm getting to be quite the professional solo beam
swapper!

As for the single cab, it is up for grabs now. My buddy couldn't get it. The
guy wants 700 bucks (I think he'd take 400 or 500 since it is sans engine).
There is the normal amount of rust and the treasure chest doors need major
repair but the gates are nearly perfectly straight, which is rare. I'd pick
it up, but my wife picked up a very large battle-ax when I mentioned it. :)
