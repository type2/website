&lt;&lt; Okay, did you get the leak to stop?

My bench bleeding must be rusty (or I was letting air back in
when moving from bench to underneath the Bus) or something...
But I kept getting leakage out the pinhole...I looked at the Bentley
again and finally noticed that their sequence was not the same as
the sequence I was following. Luckilly, I haven't had the need to
fully bleed my system for years, so I was following the &quot;usual&quot; 
sequence for bleeding - 
Right rear
Left rear
Right front
Left front
But the pedal still would not come up! So I tried the Bentley sequence -
Right front
Left front
Right rear
Left rear
I took two complete passes around the car (the jar I was bleeding into
didn't show bubbles until the second pass) Luckily I have a small adjust-
able extension pole for painting that I use to wedge the pedal down so
I didn't need a helper to pump the pedal...Once the pedal started to get
pressure higher off the floor, the leaking stopped... ;-)
