Subject: Re: [T2] Recovering the seat cushions - HELP!


If you are not married to replacing everything to original specs...
I went with a marine quality fabric.  It comes in a variety of colors and 
styles, It costs a little more but it is some sort of super scotchguarded, 
Melissa and i have found it to be very durable, and easy to clean, esp with 
2 kids under 2 and the dog.

fwiw,

&gt;How much material do I need to reupholster the interior of our '78 Westy? 
&gt;We plan to recover everything.
&gt;
&gt;I've heard 12 yards of fabric but I want to get a second opinion.
&gt;
&gt;By the way when any of you start looking for fabric - and it you want to 
&gt;stray from the original colors - look around your city or town. Locally we 
&gt;have a surplus furniture upholstery supplier - they get the ends of the 
&gt;rolls of fabric for couch and recliner manufacturers here in the south 
&gt;east. Some of it has UV inhibitors in the fabric (won't fade badly).
&gt;
&gt;We found another store about 30 miles from home with a better selection 
&gt;and possibly better prices (at first glance) .
&gt;
&gt;Both are deals where you need to buy what you need the first time b/c they 
&gt;may not be able to get more and thus the reason I want to be sure to get 
&gt;enough material.
