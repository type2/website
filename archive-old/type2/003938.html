X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

I can't explain why the archives are gone, and I read every email about
them.  Let's hope the aliens bring them back, no explanation necessary.

Until they do, I'm throwing my own 25 cents worth into the pail of exchange:
anyone who would like a hardcopy of my engine dolly plan (formerly on the
archive) or a paper template of the engine tray shape for homemaking your
own to fit in a 71 era bus is welcome to email me with a request for same,
and it will wing it's way to your post office address, no charge.  Further,
they're welcome to pass them along to anyone they like.  It'll be a long
time before my debt is paid to this group.  Likewise, if anyone  needs a cad
file of the AIRS logo (except mine doesn't have the ambulance lights on it),
lemme know.  I can email that to you in a variety of formats.

Long live the free and open exchange of lessons hard learned.
