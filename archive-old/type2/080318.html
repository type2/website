Oh hey, don't get me wrong.
I didn't even ask how much they were offering.  No way I was going to offer up

Just posted this as an informational and in the off chance that
someone might be interested in their next to death DC.

&gt; in popularity only to Sambas, even Baywindow DCs, &amp;
&gt; the fact that they're a tradesman's vehicle means
&gt; they're getting even rarer, even the Bays.
