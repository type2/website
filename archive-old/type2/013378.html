Probably not viable to ship most buses to Oz (LHD - RHD conversion and 
compliance adds AUD $7-10,000 to the bill AFTER shipping costs, making it 
outside the acceptable range for most people), but parts are a viable market. 
As noted, there are things that were just left off the models we get here that 
many of us want.

Most people won't pay that much for the older vans, a friend's comment when I 
told him that I was looking at spending $5-6,000 on a '72 (if it's still 
available), was &quot;Why would you pay that much for a 30 year old car???&quot; (then he 
spent the next 10 minutes trying to find a reason to say that it was a stupid 
thing to do, but couldn't, he likes buses too ;^)

On the rise of Bay prices, I'm REALLY surprised that it's taking so long to 
start, Splitties cost too much to consider here now (though I prefer Bays 
anyway), but the kick-on of prices is still hanging back ( and will until I get 
my Crewcab, I hope ;^), it's weird, really.

&gt; Hmmm, so why are we allowing all these bays to go to the crusher. Sounds
&gt; like money to be made shipping these to OZ. Its really a crime in SoCal when
&gt; you see these dry straight buses going to the crusher 'cause they blew an
&gt; engine and you know with the late stuff its probably just bad heads. I've
&gt; said it before, with the prices people are asking for splits its only a
&gt; matter of time before the speculators start snatching up bay windows and
&gt; driving up prices. ok time to get off the soap box
