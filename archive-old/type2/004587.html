Subject: [T2] Dashpot

My 71 Westy has this &quot;thing&quot; mounted inside the left edge of the engine
hatch opening.  I always thought it was part of a throttle dashpot system,
the other component of which would have been mounted on the carburetor,
based on photos and text in my Bently book.  It was not hooked up to
anything when I got the bus, and I have not done anything with it in the 17
years I've had the bus.  A recent post on the list discussed something that
matched the discription of this thing that I have, only talked about it
being hooked up in the distributor vacuum retard line.  Does anybody know
what this thing is, and how it should be hooked up, and am I better off not
hooking it up or should I go to the trouble of connecting it?  If it is
emissions related - not an issue for me (unless it's making my bus really
belch out alot of pollution) - my bus is old enough that I no longer have to
get an emissions test. In earlier times, when I did have to get the
emissions test, I never had a problem - always passed with flying colors.
