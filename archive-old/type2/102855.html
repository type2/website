Update: I installed these in my '71 standard Beetle last fall.  So far, they
are working fine, in spite of my having removed the &quot;ball bearing
doohickeys&quot; 'cause they would not work otherwise.  I think they would work
fine in a bus, too.  A while back, there was a post with a photo link
showing a bracket fabbed by the poster from angle iron to facilitate
mounting the retractor mechanism in the stock bus location - not sure what
year bus was shown in the photo, but it matched my 71.  That would be the
way to go, IMHO.

I havn't seen the JCW belts, so I can't offer a comparison.  The Beetlemex
belts came in boxes with VW logo, so I guess that could substantiate their
claim that these are the belts being installed in the current production
Mexican Beetles.  The quality is not on par with original stuff from days of
yore, but it's OK.

It took about a week and a half for them to deliver - a little on the long
side IMHO but reasonable.

Could anyone who has ordered the retractable seat belts from Beetle-Mex
please confirm these are valid parts for a 74 campmobile? They don't
match up with the part numbers listed on the &quot;Retractable Seat Belts&quot;
article at http://www.type2_dot_com/library/interior/retabelt.htm

They are about half the price of the JC Whitney versions. How do they
compare in materials and installation? Has anyone figured out that
installation issue with the &quot;ball bearing dohickeys&quot; listed in the
archives?

Is Beetle-Mex a reliable importer? Are there others? I can't find these
on eurocampers_dot_com anymore.

cheers,
Victor
