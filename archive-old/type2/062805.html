Subject: Re: Deluxe Micro Middle Seat?

&gt;This is false information.  There were 7, 8, and 9 passenger buses
&gt;and I have the model numbers and m-codes to prove it.  ;)
&gt;
&gt;I'll post the info when I get back in town Monday.
&gt;
&gt;Respectfully,

&gt;
&gt;&gt;Non-walkthroughs (24s) were all nine seaters.  What 'officially'
&gt;&gt;distinguished 25s (walk-throughs) from 24s were not the fact they
&gt;&gt;were 'walkthrough' but the fact they were 7 seaters......
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;What I'm trying to say in a most convoluted manner is that
&gt;&gt;non-walkthroughs were all (originally) 9 seaters  and all
&gt;&gt;walk-throughs were 7 seaters....

*sigh*

shot down in flames (again) by a guru (only when you can catch the fly on
my palm....).

I based my know-it-all attitude on the fact that the model no.s I have
describe the 25 as 7-seater (for example 251 was 7 seater LHD).  My M-codes
don't show any options for mix'n'matching middle seats (but then again
there's a few numbers missing in that list as well...)
