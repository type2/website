&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt;   I've been laying on the front floor of our '71 wondering how to fix the broken heat control levers in my dash.  The only parts yard around here with buses doesn't have any for an early bay.  The metal levers are broken off just above the dash and of course there are no knobs on them.   So I'm wondering;
&gt;     1.  does anyone have a pair of these levers to sell me?

BustedBus might be the place to start.

&gt;     2.  what do I use in place of the plastic rivet that holds the 2 pieces of the lever together?  The dealer says the OEM part is no longer available and I dont see anything in the usual catalogs.

Nothing.  the spring clips that go between the levers and their &quot;sockets&quot;
hold things nice and firm.  The next time you remove the levers to remove
the instrument cluster you'll thank me.

George
