While we're on the topic of body panels I purchased the 3 windshield repair pieces from AH Schofield in the UK (via Bus Depot). They are #29 in on his webpage and are just enough to go under the seal and curve a bit at the ends to do part of a pillar.

I'm having my windshield area repaired because of holes under the seal in the pillar and the entire length of the bottom sill was rusted through. The bodyman thought the repair pieces were a good start but the original metal had a compund break whereas the replacement panels were completely flat on the bottom and contained some holes (possible for hanging/painting).

I understand a good metal fabricator can do just about anything but I thought based on the hourly shop rate these would be a good start and I didn't know what to expect of the shop.

In the end, he had to massage them into the right shape but now that there are in they look perfect.
