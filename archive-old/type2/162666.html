&gt; I have a new mechanic for my 70 bus after the 4 month nightmare that cost me
&gt; $1200.  Basically my engine is shot.  I have another motor being installed
&gt; tomorrow.

&gt; The new mechanic says that I need to run 91 octain gas.  He said that it
&gt; plays an important role in keeping the engine cool.  What's the story?
