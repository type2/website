Subject: Re: [T2] Cleaning engine parts

George and Carlos, I use a product formerly known as VARSOL, now found
in most SAFETY-KLEEN parts washers, sold in some flaps in my area for
about $3.00 a gal.This stuff evaporates completely, removes 95% of all
grease and dirt(5% left removed by sand blasting(G!), and leaves very
little cleanup. Shop around.

My .021/2.

Chris.
