Subject: Re: [T2] Tow Hitch needed for 68' Kombi

&gt; I'm looking for a tow hitch to attach to my 68' Kombi.  I need to tow a
&gt; small boat (14' sail boat), as well as the empty trailer from my &quot;big boat&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; Recalling the posts about towing capacity of the Type 2, I'll add that each
&gt; of these items weighs less than 500 lbs and will be towed less than 10
&gt; miles/trip across flat prarie roads :-)
