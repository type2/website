OK

I have at least one bearing going bad, (Ron is sending a bunch of
bearings)  I eventially hope to change out all of my wheel bearings as
most if not all (but one CV) are originals from 1978.  

the bus is making the low rumble of a bad bearing, is worse when drifting
and turning right.  but ^%_at_$#&amp; 	I can't figure out which bearing is the
bad one, or as I suspect there is a rear CV joint and a front wheel
bearing that are going bad together.  I have been driving and listening
and feeling for heat, but Disk brakes are always warm after driving.  Any
hints on how to figure out which one to change out first.

this is a daily driver so I can't afford to have her down for long periods
of time.


Thanks
Bob
