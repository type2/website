Subject: Re: [T2] Need help with the transmission

Thans for the suggestionss 
 
My first job was when this problem occured to check the transmission 
with the engine not running, to exclude the clutch. So it is surely 
not the clutch :( 
 
I went outside (there is about 1' snow out there) and lyed under the 
bus. The coupler - I found it :) - is OK. Looks fine. 
My wife moved the shifter aroung, and it just moves around, without 
finding a gear, only the third is what can be found, if you push it 
REALLY HARD. 
 
So what now? Should I dismantle the whole transmission system? Read on 
some page that there are some &quot;slots&quot; which can go &quot;mixed up&quot; and can 
cause a problem like this. But it is not clear to me where they are, 
and how to realign them?
