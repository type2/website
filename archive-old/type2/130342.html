Subject: RE: [T2] what type of dual carbs for a Type IV 2 liter

Same story as Mike but replace every reference of Weber with Dell. Took me several weeks to learn to tune them but they were great once I got them just so. Stayed right and I assume that still, sitting on the shelf in my shed, they are STILL right, after 10 years... &lt;grin!&gt;

I was running them on a stock 2.0 Type IV bus motor in my Beetle. Hope to buy a second set for spares and stick with the Dells for the Beetle. Will stick with my stock Corvair carbs on my stock Corvair powered bus BUT plan to go to Megasquirt as soon as I can. EFI is the way to go really. 

For anyone that is interested I have a pair of Dell side draft 40mm (45mm?) carbs (unaltered from the factory) and would love to do a straight trade for some 36mm DLRA Dells. 

Thanks! 

Chris
