Subject: Smokin Brakes...

Pulled into the parking lot at work today in my 71 and my right rear wheel was smoking from the brake sticking on that wheel.  My question is this: If the little metal latch clicker thingy (sorry for the technical terms) that keeps the adjusting star from moving is not seating in the cogs of the star, will the brakes shoes tighten up on that wheel with use? My assumption was that the shoes would loosen if anything. I backed the adjustment off enough to completely free the wheel, and I'm due for a brake job either way, so I'm really just curious.



Peace, John Baker
