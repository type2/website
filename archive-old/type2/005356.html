Doesn't the turnkey Beetlemex come with a *34 pict. Bocar carburator?  I've
been looking for engines sold with FI and haven't had much luck other than
through private sellings.  Does anyone know where you can get a new or
rebuilt 2.0 pancake with FI?

Thanks,
Christopher

&gt;why pay 1600+ dollars for aftermarket FI when you could spend basically
&gt;the same money for a beetlemex turnkey w/ FI??
