    Actually it is quite easy to change those numbers by what is called
&quot;punching&quot; -- a technique where a small pin punch is tapped along both
sides of each character at an angle, so the groove in the metal closes,
then a bigger punch is used straight downwards, slowly tap, tap, tapping
until the whole thing smooths out. Then a set of numerical and
alphabetical punches is used to put the new numbers in it's place.
    This works very well in both steel and alloy, and is a common
technique used by bike thief rings. It is virtually undectectable,
except by using a fluroscope (??) or something like that which can
detect the disturbed grain in the metal underneath, but ususally can't
actually read the old numbers, just that they have been altered. The
obvious giveaway, of course, is if the numbers and title don't match the
obvious vehicle year.  If the numbers have been altered, you are well
advised to not purchase at any price.
