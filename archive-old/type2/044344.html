Subject: [T2] Vented gas cap for '73

List,

Does anyone know of a different model of vehicle that would use the same 
size gas cap as my '73, only vented?  I would like to be able to go to my 
FLAPS and say &quot;I need a gas cap for a _____ (insert appropriate model 
here)&quot;, and get a vented cap to fit my bus.  As it is, they can only look it 
up in the book and it says it needs a non-vented cap.  They can't seem to 
tell me if I have any other options.

The carbon filter system has been removed and plugged (not by me).  I 
believe this at one time functioned as the venting system.  The current cap 
seals well enough to build up a vacuum in the tank (it whooshes when I 
remove it).  There was a lot of information in the archives, but I didn't 
find any specific model numbers or compatible vehicles.  I don't really want 
to drill a hole in the cap and create a potential for leaks, or start buying 
caps 'till I find the right one.

The bus seems to run fine, but I'd like to weed out any potential problems.

Thanks

Dan in Spokane
