Happy Friday everyone! =20

 I'm doing a little survey, a bit of research you could say.  I have been=
 all over the country, but I have only had the pleasure of driving a bus =
on the east coast, and the west.  Mass, and Cal. to be exact.  In Califor=
nia, I had a 67 deluxe, and I had a 71 westie.  Driving a vintage VW is a=
 lot more common out there.  Very rarely was I ever pulled over by police=
, in fact, never. And I lived out there for a while.  When I grew up, I l=
ived in Mass, and it seemed that just being in a VW bus put you at risk o=
f being pulled over, and hassled.  And a deadhead sticker on it, then you=
 are really asking for trouble!!!
I'm wondering if it is a problem everyone faces, or does it vary state, t=
o state?  If the bus is mint, is it different?  Answers, comments, and st=
ories appreciated!!  :) =20
