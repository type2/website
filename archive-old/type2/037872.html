Subject: Re: 74 Bus with FI?

&gt; The Bus is a 74 and has had the engine and trans &gt;removed. I will be
striping it of more parts. What I found &gt;strange it that it was Fuel
Injection. It was also an &gt;Automatic. Now my 74 Kombi is Carbed and a 4sp.
Did &gt;they put FI in the Autos 1 year before the manuals? I &gt;looked it over
real close and it has all the factory &gt;brackets, control mod, and everything
for FI, and it has &gt;the same production date as my 74 carbed Bus. The &gt;date
is 4/74. I know in the Bugs the Autostick got IRS a ?&gt;year before the
manual, did this happen with the FI on &gt;the Bus?

It should be a Calif. version 1800 w/FI w/auto trans. Very rare. Only saw
one in the past 5 years here in Calif!!
Only the auto trans got FI in Calif.
