Subject: Re: [T2] Wondering about a wire...

From: &quot;Greg Potts&quot; &lt;Greg_at_pottsfamily_dot_ca&gt;
&gt; That wire might be part of the heater booster fan circuit. Do you have
&gt; a booster blower in your bus??

It doesn't seem to attach to the booster fan harness.  It's quite a heavy
wire, maybe 8-10 gauge (I think).  It has a round connector on the end, then
6&quot; of wire with &quot;Reinshagen&quot; embossed in the insulation, then a yellow
somewhat cooked connector, then a continuation of the red wire into the
protective sheath.

While I was looking at it, I discovered another loose wire near the coil.
It's part of the harness at the coil.  It's white (or at least light
colored) with a green stripe.  It has a spade connector on the end of it.
Any ideas?  Oh, and I found the color wiring harness pic.  I'll try tracing
it out there, too.

With the FI replaced with a single carb, it's possible that I'll find wires
that go nowhere, but I just hate to have them floating around in the engine
compartment.
