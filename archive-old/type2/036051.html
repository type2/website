Subject: valves

Hi people:
    I am about to do a tune up on my bus and vaguely recall some one on the
list writing that they set their valves to .004 on intake and .006 on the
exhaust (or vice versa). I would be curious to know if there are any
advantages or disadvantages to doing this. Also, The PO said that he set the
1600dp engine in my '69 Westy to .008. Does this seem reasonable?
Thanks for any info,
Jeff Mitchell
'69 Westy
