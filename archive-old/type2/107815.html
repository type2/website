Subject: Re: [T2] Rimco - good heads, bad studs

Bus Depot lists them, though it's confusing.  The right part number
(N0146841) is listed as follows:

Exhaust Stud Cylinder Head, 74-79 Bus, 8mm x9mm $5.49 N0146841

However, when I look at the air-cooled Vanagon &quot;head&quot; section of the site I
see:

Exhaust Stud Cylinder Head, 72-79 Bus, 80-83 Vanagon, 8mm x8mm $2.09
N0144277

You might want to call and ask.

&gt; &gt;SNAG:  The studs they sent for my beautifully re-worked heads won't work!
&gt; &gt;They sent me 14 (?) studs that were about 1.5 inches long and 18 (?)
studs
&gt; &gt;that were a whopping 1 inch long.  The longer ones will work for the
&gt; &gt;intakes, but not anywhere close for the exhausts.  And I have no idea
what
&gt; &gt;the 18 one-inch studs would possibly be used for!
&gt;
&gt; Follow-up:  As suggested by Doktor Tim, I called RIMCO and asked them
&gt; (sounds like the obvious thing to do, but it hadn't occurred to me).  They
&gt; said they currently do no have a source for the exhaust studs!  Wish
they'd
&gt; told me that before hand so I could have at least kept my old ones.  I had
&gt; asked them to remove/replace all studs and fix the threads in the heads
&gt; wherever necessary.  The thread repair they did was fine.  Just wish they
&gt; had sent some useable exhaust studs back with the heads.
&gt;
&gt; So now I'm scouring the internet looking for eight M8 x 1.25 x 56mm studs.
&gt; Anybody got any or know where I can order them?
