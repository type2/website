&gt; Hi Isaiah
&gt; Let me make sure I read this right - You pulled up to a pump and watched
&gt; the guy put the diesel in and now you want to know what recourse you
&gt; have against the gas station?!

but as he said it was being pumped from a &quot;GASOLINE&quot; pump  also if I
remember my Diesel color codes, isn't it boat diesel that is dyed green,
that wasn't even motor fuel, if nothing else the company could be gotten
for not paying the motor fuel tax.   sounds like some supplier dropped the
wrong fuel into the wrong tank....most pump jockeys have no clue as to
what they are pumping...
  not sure what diesel does to a gas engine, probably not as bad as what
gas does to a diesel engine (ask me how I know, I owned some buses and one
of my employees pumped gas into a bus, not VW type bus !)
