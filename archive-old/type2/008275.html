Subject: RE:cv joints on '82 westy
Date: Wed, 10 Feb 1999 21:14:28 -0600

Thanks to everyone for the info on the cost of the job.  I'm picking it up
tommorrow and here is a rough breakdown of the costs:

3 cv joints _at_ $50 = $150
4 boots _at_ $12 = $48
overnight shipping (twice)  = approx. $25
8 hrs labor _at_ $20 = $160

TOTAL = $383

Thank goodness I live where labor is cheap!!

Right after I pick it up, we are heading out for its first big trip:  13
hours from the Missouri Ozarks to Pennsylvania.  If you see a blue Vanagon
with flashers on, please help!!  I will report on the trip, bus sightings,
and buses FS next week.

Peace,
Erich Elmer
