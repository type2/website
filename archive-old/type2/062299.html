Subject: Anyone Going to Yakima, WA for Volksfest?

Volksfest 96 is 7-8 September in Yakima, Washington.  I'm going and, even 
though I'd love to take my new 59 Westy, looks like I'll be taking trusty 
Rozetta, the 71 Westy instead (it's only 140 miles, but there are a few 
little things that need to be fixed first before I take the 59 out of 
town).  Next year.

Anyone on the list going to/interested in this show?

Ken
