Subject: Re: SOTO or **NEATO**?

&gt; &gt; Anyone care to enlighten me, and offer a testimonial or 
two?
&gt; NEATO is, IMNSHO, definately the way to go.

I would DEFINATELY concur, SOTO (amongst other problems) 
seems to have FAR too much attitude for me, and ass well the 
NEATO newsletter is WAY better IMHo. Much larger classified 
section two (pun intended)





&gt; As a Westy owner, you might also want to check out the 
Camp Box News. I think
&gt; there was someone on the list connected with them. 

i have a subscription, just saw Todd Swangstu (editor) on 
the weekend, he tells me he is way behind on the most 
current issue, oh joy!
