Subject: Yay! The new motor runs!
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSD.3.90.991004124806.23529A-100000_at_user2.mnsinc_dot_com&gt;

I just wanted to notify the list that my
first 100% new motor runs. I had donetwo
rebuilds before, but they were a 'ring and bearings' rebuild,
not many new parts. This engine (1600cc) was my first
with many new parts including case, CW crank, rebuilt
rods, new heads and one piece rockers, larger valves (37.5x42),
new cam, etc. An order of magnitude more unknown parts.
It is also the first eninge that I used high performance 
parts (bigger heads, CW crank) and many of the parts
needed tooling and more customization to fit well together.
It was also my first attempt at balancing an engine.

All in all, the build up was not too bad, but there were a lot
of maddening details near the end. Alternator bumps the carb,
rear tin hits the pully, oil filter lines needed routing
and are hard to plug in once the rear hanger is installed, etc.

When I fired it up the first time, it was making a hell of a racket
and was having a hard time turning over. That is when I found out how
the pully hit the tin, as aluminum shavings were flying all over. 
I stoppped and bent the tin some, but it is still hittin
a little bit. I dont know why it would do that, the tin came
off of another engine with the same pully on it.
20 minutes of annoying the neighbors with a 2-3k
RPM run while I set the timing, and the only oil
leak was from the filter, where the face is not 
flat enough to prevent a slow weep. I guess Ill polish it
better. 

Could not have done it without the list!
