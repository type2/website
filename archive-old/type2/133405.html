&gt; Going to court today to fight Landlord. He wants to evict myself and family
&gt; because of breach of contract. His wife doesn't like my &quot;disgusting hunk of
&gt; junk&quot;. My lease states that no inopperable vehicles be parked outside. My
&gt; camper doesn't fit into my garage, height restrictions. But I should fare
&gt; well with a verbal agreement that he and I made that if it was not visible
&gt; from the street. It's not and he has not told his wife about the agreement I
&gt; am sure. Wish me luck.

good luck but from sad experience fighting a landlord in the long run is
a no win situation, even if you win, you lose..

good luck
