&gt; I bought an 81 Vanagon a couple of years ago.  It does not run and was to=

It has always been my experience that owning a VW is a labor of love. Unles=

you are willing to invest the time and money to do at least some of the wor=

yourself, your probably in for some repair expenses. While early volksies
were rather simple machines, yours is probably riddled with electronic
gizmos. (Meaning more opportunity to go wrong)  I would suggest that you
consider where you want to go with this.

Do you want the project car that you will have to put tender love into, or
do you want the car that you don=B9t have to touch?

Do you like to sweat?

Do you like to dig into a repair manual to find solutions to often simple
problems?

Believe it or not I'm not trying to talk you into selling it. I think that
having a project car and doing my own repairs is rewarding and exhilarating=
,
and I suspect that many more share my feelings.

A well tuned and maintained volksie will give you years of enjoyment. It
will also be your faithful companion.
