Subject: [T2] tranny bracket for bowden tube

i have a 79 tranny in now after my 76 sequncers went out .....
well the 79 tranny did not have a bracket for the bowden tube so i took my old one off my 76 and put it on there bolted right up and i am driving it like this .... thing is the bowden tube bend is not correct becuse evidentually the bracket is diffrent for the 79 tranny.. the metal at end of bowden tube clutch side is rubbing the cable and sooner or later will snap... i have another but why go through the trouble.... ride it till it breaks everytime....
 
does anyone out there have a 79 tranny bracket.... i have been looking for this for some time now and with the spring and summer nearing its more reason for it to go sooner than later....
if you could help me with this i would be very appreciative...
i will more than likley be at everybus if needed be ... hopeing will at least get me there,... takes like 10- 20 minutes probadly to fix...
Is there a difference in brackets betweent he 76 and 79 tranny... one would surely think so ? or is my bracket messed up?
peace
Chris
