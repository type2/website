That type I engine won't last very long in a '72 bus.  When they went to
the type 4 engine, the tranny gearing went up as well.  If you don't seal
the engine off, it will last even less time.  You also have to fabricate a
brace to hold the back of the engine up as the one from the '71 will not
fit in a '72.

In short DON'T DO IT!!!!!  You will be money and time ahead if you just
rebuild a type 4 engine.


&gt;I have a '72 Bus (station wagon), putting a '71 engine in it.  The engine
&gt;bay is quite a bit bigger than the Type I engine.  What are the
&gt;suggestions as to how to put tin around the engine and bay area to seal it
&gt;off, and how important is it to do this.
