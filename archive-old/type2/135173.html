Subject: RE: [T2] Vintage Vehicle Valuation &amp; Appraisals

I do use an insurance company (Hagerty) that covers my bus at an 'agreed
value' - the only problem is that this is a classic vehicle policy that
restricts use of the vehicle... this is not a problem for me, at least,
because I have no problems with the restrictions.

I am curious though... my regular insurance company (GEICO) for my daily
driver vehicles won't right collision or comprehensive on old vehicles.  Can
someone tell me what insurance companies will right this type of insurance
without the restrictions of classic car insurance?
