One popular cause of thin watery oil is that fuel pump bottom diaphragm.
Leaks there cause fuel to dribble into the crankcase, thinning the oil.
Not good.  This sort of problem is more common than many people think.
Obviously, if the oil level mysteriously rises, the pump is suspect.   Such
thinned oil will usualy smell like gasoline, and seriously thinned oil will
stink up the car.  Been there done that.   

Of course, sometimes overheated multigrade oil will thin out, depending on
brand... some of the older multigrades didn't like high temps at all.
Word has it that some of the cheaper oils today (house brand stuff seen on
the shelves of &quot;Cost-Cutter&quot; etc) aren't quite up to the standards of name
brand oil.   But I'm not really an authority on oils... I just watch. 

I write: 

My fuel pump isn't at fault because I have a F/I bus and the pump is up
around the tranny. However known people with this exact trouble in carb
cars and VW's. You are right on the mark there.

I've been running Havoline 10W-40 so it's not junky oil. That is not an
item I feel comofrtable scrimping on. It very could well be dead oil from
overheating. I really give my oil hell and plenty of use. I do alot of
mountain climbing around here - there are hills everywhere. My dipstick is
seldom too hot to handle but who knows what it is doing when I on the road.
I have a full set of VDO gauges (oil and head temp, and oil press.) but
have not replaced the failed senders (been on my Beetle and bus a combined
3 years) which I discarded after this last rebuild. They had worked okay
(oil sender showed below actual numbers by 10 psi) but disintergrated when
I removed them. Soon. 

I appreciate your time Tony.
