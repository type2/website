To whom it may concern, I've finally posted the first pics of my 69/70 =
Westy on the web! And it's in disguise as my wedding day getaway car! If =
you'd like to check em out, go to
http://pages.prodigy_dot_net/bugsville42/index.html
and click the 'getaway in the van' button.
Peruse the rest if you like, we had a GREAT photographer, and there's a =
few mildly artsy shots, and some downright silly ones as well.
It's amazing that being a web designer, I never get to do my OWN stuff, =
I have pictures of the entire restoration from tear apart, to snandd =
prime &amp; paint to build up that I've been meaning to put up somewhere as =
well. I'll post when I do, however...
