Subject: [T2] New or Rebuilt?? hard choice

hey everyone, my dilemma is as follows.  The engine in my 71' westy went
over the summer and i pulled it out last weekend. It seems to have been
the #4 connecting rod bearings--they melted.  So i guess I would need a
rebuilt crank and a new set of rods.  Otherwise all is well.  I gues I
would replace obvious stuff--rings, push tubes, oil pump etc.--the
obvious.  The only thing is, I cant decide wether to have my old engine
rebuilt or go for Chirco performance's deal on the brand new mexi
engine.  I know the new ones last a whole lot longer, and since I am in
NJ it would be ALOT for me to have a rebuilt sent out to me(over 750$). 
Should I go for the New engine (about 1300$ shipped), Rebuilt(about 800$
shipped) or have mine rebuilt? Also should I invest in several new parts
along with the new engine ie- new carb, generator, etc or rebuild the
old parts.  Please let me know what you think is the best plan and
please let me know. I am only 17 years old and dont have a whole lot of
cash(college coming soon) so i would like to spend my money wisely. 
Thanks in advance for any responses.
