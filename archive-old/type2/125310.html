Subject: RE: [T2] Type 4 motor, engine stand question...

-----Original Message-----From: Mark Hineline 
&gt;Bench starting a Type 4 motor is considered by many to be a bad idea; 
&gt;this is a characteristic that makes it quite different from an upright.

Is this due to: &quot;tip over danger&quot;, cooling, case damage (stress _at_ mounts),
something I forgot, all the above???

Thanks
