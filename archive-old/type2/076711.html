Subject: Re: [T2] solid/hydraulic swap?

on 11/23/01 2:53 PM, you related:

&gt; gang,
&gt; 
&gt; what i'm wondering is, would it be
&gt; possible for me to rebuild the 76 engine, and just
&gt; swap the solid lifters for hydraulics. can this be
&gt; done?

this is possible. there are things which need to be done. i may not get all
of them, but here goes:

any stock vw hydraulic cams and lifters (from a core motor) will most likely
not be useable, so you will need a new cam. don't regrind, get a new one and
good new lifters. excellent cams are found here:

the case needs to be modified, but not drastically. the oil passages are
different. i can't be specific, but if you put up a post about what you want
to do on the type4um here...

...you will undoubtedly get a chorus of educated replies to your questions.
some may tell you not to switch: this solid/hydraulic debate is a hot one in
certain circles. i myself have just converted my 1979 bus motor to solid
lifters and a performance cam. there are benefits on either side of the
debate.

the pushrods are different, as is some valvetrain hardware. the rocker
shafts on hydraulic motors have solid spacers and springy washers instead of
the flat washers and springs found on the solid heads. listmember terry kay
was doing this swap, then changed his mind, so he may have a bunch of these
bits.

one HAS to ask why you feel the need to do this swap: is it because of
frequent valve adjustments? if so, this may be indicative of cam wear, or
even seat recession. once a cam begins to wear, it deteriorates rapidly.
hydraulic lifters on a bus motor are not a panacea. many knowledgeable
engine builders swear completely off them. others use them. the point is,
that while switching to hydraulic lifters may seem to be a problem-solver,
it is not that simple. there are different problems inherent in hydraulic
lifter motors that your solid motor does not have. if your motor is in need
of a rebuild anyways, you may be better off rebuilding a hydraulic motor
than assembling all the bits to turn yours into one. if your motor is in
good shape, then it might be cheaper to modify it.

hope that helps.
