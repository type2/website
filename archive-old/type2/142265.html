Subject: RE: [T2] messed up brakes when fixing idle?

My most recent experience with the front brakes being locked is because the
rubber hose near the wheel itself had collapsed. I took them loose the other
day and no fluid would come out of them at all. Once I put the new hose on,
fluid comes through easily. I cannot answer your questions about the master
cylinder, but you might need to change the hoses near you wheels also.

My brakes also locked when working on the engine...... strange, but mine was
probably more from sitting for a long time :)
