Subject: Re:'fridges and coolers... 

&gt;My '78 bus has a dead 'fridg by Dometik. There is an inverter 
&gt;under the back seat. It's not perfectly clear to me, but I think 
&gt;the inverter converts DC from the battery to 120 volt AC to run 
&gt;the 'fridge. Some sparky out there want to confirm that assertion 
&gt;please?

Okay, but no.  The unit under the back seat does the opposite 
(converts 120 volts AC to 12 volts DC).  The fridge is DC-only.  
When you plug AC into the side of your bus, the converter under the 
seat converts the AC into DC to:  
        a) trickle-charge your camping battery (via the timer on the 
           panel above the fridge); and
        b) run the fridge


&gt;Maybe if I left it on for 8 hours it could get cold, but after 45 
&gt;minutes the cooler unit inside the 'fridge wasn't even slightly 
&gt;cool. I'm not at all stoked about the proposition of spending 
&gt;several hundred bucks to get a new 'fridge as inefficient as my 
&gt;old one. 
&gt;Sounds to me like the Vanagon propane 'fridge is the way to go, 
&gt;but don't know if it's practical to put one in a Westy.  Anyone 
&gt;know about this one?

I recently sold a '77 Westy in which the P.O. had cut a big hole in 
the sink cabinet and installed a vertical Dometic AC/DC/LPgas 
fridge (similar to that in the Vanagon Westy, but a slightly larger 
model). This P.O. had done a pretty horrible job installing it (it 
looked sort of like a Dali rendition of a Westy cabinet when he was 
done), but I think a more competent carpenter could have done a 
much neater job, with that fridge or with a Vanagon Westy fridge. 

By the way, the buyer of this bus did not want that Dometic fridge, 
so I dropped the price on the bus and removed the fridge.  If 
anyone would like to buy it, I'd love to sell it.  The P.O. paid 
$600 for it.  All manuals, etc. are included.  I tested it on AC 
power (got cold in about 20 minutes) but did not test it on gas or 
DC.  Would take $175 for it.

&gt;They now sell a solid state electric 'fridge the size of a big 
&gt;Playmate cooler for $90 at K-Mart. Plugs into 12V. Anyone tried 
&gt;one of these out? 

I assume that that unit works on a similar principle to the 
Koolatron fridge, which I just posted about last week. I tried one 
of those in my '77 Westy before switching to the Dometic bus 
fridge. Koolatron sold me just the lid to their fridge (which has 
the guts in it) for a very reasonable price, and I mounted it 
inside my Westy icebox.  Did not do as good a job as the Dometic 
(could not keep ice frozen, for example), but was better than an 
icebox for about $100.  Did draw significantly less power than the 
Dometic, but then again, even the Dometic was mediocre, and this 
unit was even worse.  I saw the Dometic as a definate improvement 
when I switched to it, but the Dometic did require a separate 
battery while the Koolatron could run off the starting battery for 
quite some time.  

For what it's worth, the Domatic AC/DC/Propane fridge in my '85 
Vanagon Westy blows them both away, hands down.  Not only that, but 
I don't have to swivel the table out of the way every time I want 
to grab a cold beer!
