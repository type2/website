Subject: Re: [T2] Axle weights

I'm surprised the dealer didn't refer to his Michelin manual, which details
all the specs and parameters for virtually every vehicle ever manufactured.

The 6-ply rated tires are adequate for your Westfalia if the maximum
inflation pressure allowed per tire is at least 45 psi.  Check the sidewall
for that number.  If the cost isn't prohibitive I'd go for the 8-ply rated
tires.  The improvement in handling and stability would be worth it.

Your tire pressures should be as specified by VW for your Westfalia
Campmobile.  The numbers vary slightly among the references, but are ~30 to
32 psi in front and 40 to 44 psi in the rear.

The inflation pressure shown on the tire sidewall is the maximum _allowable
_ pressure, not a directive to inflate to that pressure regardless of the
application.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  I'm persevering with the Michelin Classics, 185 R14 C, - 8 ply (1875
lbs.) vs. 6 ply (1540 lbs.).

Michelin need the individual axle weights front and rear to give accurate
pressure recommendations.

The bus is a 'Standard'  Westfalia if there is such a thing - 5 seat, 5 bed,
coolbox, wardrobe, tables etc.  It weighed 1.34 tonne total.

Does anyone have even a rough idea of the individual axle weights so I can
at least start running at more realistic tyre pressures ?  &lt;&lt;
