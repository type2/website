Subject: Re: [T2] VWTrends rumor-old old fart's opinion!

I know that many of you folks (maybe MOST of you) are
younger than myself and some of the other more
experienced listmembers here. Y'all grew up in the
technology age, so it makes perfect sense to you to
replace an ink and paper magazine with an internet
mag...However, I hope there are still enough of us
&quot;geezers&quot; out there to keep the tradition of reading
hard copy alive! I really enjoyed VW Trends, I know
the tech articles were usually pretty lame or even
wrong, but just to get to sit down and look at all the
aircooleds was awesome, My other favorite thing about
the magazine was reading about all the different
events. Here in the Midwest, our VW events are fewer
and farther between that say the west coast, so during
the winter, it was really nice to sit and read about
shows other places.  Plus you can take a magazine to
the toilet, read it on the front porch swing, carry it
to work in case you get a spare minute, and a
multitude of ther things!  Maybe I am just a
sentimentalist, but anytime technology wins out over
tradition, it makes me a little sad! 
I know I just missed the technology age by about a
decade, hell I don't even know ehat an Ipod or an MP3
player is!!, but I sincerely hope, this crazy,
temperamental computer never completely replaces good
old page and print!!
