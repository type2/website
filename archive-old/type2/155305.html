&gt;I was going very slowly and using my newly purchased
&gt;torquewrench (ace micrometer 5-100 ftlbs)  I have never used a torque
&gt;wrench in a serious situation so I was going very slow being very
&gt;mindful to wait for the &quot;click&quot;.

Click type torque wrenches are notoriously inaccurate for the first 20% of their scale (0-20 ft lbs. on yours).

&gt;Now the hole does not look stripped where the stud came out.  no real
&gt;serious looking aluminum shavings in the thread of the stud.  I mean
&gt;there were some evidence of aluminum in the threads but I think that
&gt;the miniscule amount is normal??

It's from the stud twisting. There should be no shavings. Have you cleaned out the hole to check out the threads as best you can see?

&gt;SO here I am I have the stud and stripped nut.  I live in seattle, is
&gt;there somewhere here I can go TOMORROW and get a replacement stud and
&gt;nut so I can put things back together?  I am going to check ovals and
&gt;autosport here on the southend but I am leaving on a trip on tues and
&gt;if someone knows a better place that has a high likely hood of having
&gt;a stud I will call them too.

The M7 nuts have a 0.7mm thread pitch so they maybe hard to find. I bought some from Scott at Germany Supply a while back.

&gt;What is the likelyhood that I stripped the stud hole?  Are they
&gt;supposed to bottom out and if so, shouldn't it take more than 18ftlbs
&gt;of force to strip the stud?

The torque on those rocker nuts is only 10-11 ft. lbs. The stud shouldn't move until much more torque (maybe 40 ft. lbs for that step stud size). If you got the stud to move at 18 ft. lbs (or there about) I think the hole could have been damaged from an earlier time. Or, your torque wrench may have put more into it.

The parts manual shows a threaded insert (311 101 167C) used on later models.

If the thread damage is mild you might have luck with blue loctite but I'd wait until other people weigh in with their opinions.

&gt;If its not stripped, whats the best way to go about installing the
&gt;stud, I don't think bently covers it.  How much should I torque the
&gt;stud?

Since you probably don't have a tool for this you can trying using two nuts next to each other so they both turn with the stud. Removing the nuts and leaving the stud secure can be tricky.

Since the threads are damaged you can't torque it back to spec (whatever that is). Shoot for an 1/8th of a turn tight with the loctite. If you can't do that without stripping the hole more, you need to repair it properly.
