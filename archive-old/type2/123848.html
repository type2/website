Nice score for your friend Richard! I have a 72 also, but I don't find the 
lack of access much trouble. Switched to a Weber progressive, though, so 
things are much less crowded over the motor. This issue of the can hitting 
everything came up with me a few weeks ago, and I was advised to reindex the 
distributor drive shaft.

Have fun!

John

&gt; Given the lack of access hatch I'd like to pop in a pertronix while 
&gt; replacing these other parts. With the oil bath cleaner there is a lot of 
&gt; grunge on top of the engine. Rather than remove the distributor I'd like 
&gt; to simply rotate it. I can't see how to rotate the distributor much 
&gt; without the vacuum can hitting the breather box, then the oil bath air 
&gt; filter.

&gt; Advice?
