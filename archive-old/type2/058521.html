As you can see, my Battery Tray is pretty far gone.  I have a '71, so the
idea of pulling the engine to replace it isn't that bad.  I think most Type
IV owners would consider this (engine pull) a bigger project than the tray
replacement!

I mounted a makeshift bracket that is holding up wood... but I'm very
anxious to get this repaired.  I've had an order in with Ron _at_ Bus Depot for
over 2 weeks that he said should arrive today...

P.S.  Is this common problem attributed to a) some type of water drain
issue?  b) Battery acid that accumulates on terminals?  c) Some electrical
charge interaction, given that ground for the whole bus returns through body
metal here?

My battery tray was also quite bad. Under the battery the hole was growing
and already about 75% of the size of the battery. The flange that holds the
battery at the right hand side was completly gone. I did a makeshift repair
at the same time I started the welding job on the rocker. I fabricated a
metal plate that fits underneath the battery and used a clamp to hold the
battery on the right hand side. The clamp was screwed down thru what was
left of the original tray. All in all it is a decent emergency repair. About
three weeks ago I bought a new battery tray with the intent of doing a more
pemanent repair job (and write about it). However I think the only way to do
it properly is when you also remove the engine in order to get working
space. It is just too hard to work around the corner.  With the engine out
you can actually work from inside the engine compartment.  It is a a shame
VW decided to weld the rear valence in as from '72 or so. It was so much
easier when you could just take that part out. I read about someone trying
to make it removable on a later bus. Did anyone actually manage to do that ?
