&gt; The passenger and driver side door locks are problematic on my '71. I've

&gt; the door, I'm guessing. My machanic replaced a spring that he said was
&gt; problematic and it worked great for 10 minutes! Any wisdom from experienced
&gt; lock surgeons? Thanks, Craig

The fact that it worked great is a clue.  Check that spring again!
