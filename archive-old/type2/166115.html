&gt; I imagine it is quite advanced now.

Yes,
There are a lot of very NEAT features coming out of the woodwork with 
the MS.  I am extremely excited.

If there are people that are interested in going the MS route, I have a 
detailed install log that I keep that is specific to the bus.


&gt; The engine im working on i think may have deeper
&gt; issues that just lack of suitable ignition and
&gt; carbueration solutions.

&gt; Runs hot and won't do more than 45mph.

Eeek.. yeah, I'd make sure it's ok mechanically and then make sure 
ignition and fuel control are working properly.


&gt; Could be the timing i guess. I know its advanced but i
&gt; haven't put a light on it yet.

I'd do that right away!!  You could be frying that poor engine.
