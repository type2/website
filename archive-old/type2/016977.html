Subject: Re: Gas Leak,  Aaaack!!!! (Fuel neck restrictor)
References: &lt;000301be5488$88ed6fa0$1f032399_at_MSN/WMeinhart&gt;

PS:  I did this procedure b/c there was a tear on the inside of the fuel neck
restrictor and I would spill gas otherwise.  After removal of the part and
comparison with the new part, I realized that it was not necesarry replacement
for me to make.  Only the inside of the restrictor was torn (the bird beak) and
it could not have been spilling gas.  I suggest you make sure where your fuel
neck restrictor is really torn before doing this procedure.

You're in luck.  I was saving this for later, but here goes.  I replaced the
&quot;fuel neck restrictor&quot; on my 78 CA bus this weekend.  The part was $51 from the
VW Dealership.  I couldn't find it anywhere else for much less.  I had one
mechanic tell me that the procedure required drilling a hole on the inside of
the bus directly behind the gas cap.  Well, I wasn't up for that.  Another
mechanic told me it could be done without drilling the hole.  A few listees
agreed that the hole was unnecessary.  Both mechanics quoted me 1.5 to 2.0 hours
of labor for the procedure.  My proven procedure is as follows.  (I'm not sure
about the differences between your 77 and my 78)

First off, I removed the air filter, air flow box (mine is fuel injected),
battery, the computer itself, and everything else needed to reach the round
cover on the right side of the engine compartment.

Next I removed the gas tank cover.  I know that this is not normally done
without removing the engine, but it can be done.  Don't forget to remove the two
screws that enter from underneath the bus.  Once all 8 screws are removed,
remove the cover.  I was able to pull the top of the cover out first (the engine
tin keeps it from coming straight out).  It's easier to get out than it is to
put back in.

Once the cover is out, you'll have to disconnect the hose b/t the tank and the
pipe that goes back to the fuel neck restrictor.  It is not necessary to
disconnect the hose from the pipe.  Next, remove the gas cap and the metal cover
holding the fuel next restrictor to the bus.  Once these are disconnected, you
have to wiggle the pipe with the rubber pieces on each end around until you can
get it out of the hole the plate was covering.  The hose that was connected to
the tank should be pushed as far forward and to the right as possible for the
assembly to come out easily.

Once the pipe and hose are out, make sure to mark the position and orientation
of the bad neck restrictor before removing it.

Installation is basically the same as reverse.

If you have trouble removing or installing the assembly, you can remove the hose
that was connected to the tank from the pipe.  It will make it easier, but is
not necessary.  Be sure to note its position and orientation before removing it.

Once installed, its time to put the cover back on the gas tank compartment.  In
order to do this, the bottom of the cover has to be put in first b/c of the
engine tin.  To do this, I bent the top of the cover a quarter inch.  Once the
cover was seated and the hole aligned, I took a screw driver and hammer and
straightend out the bends I had made.

End of procedure.

Disclaimer:  This worked on a '78 bus with Fuel Injection.  I make no claim that
it will work on all make and models.

I won't be drilling a hole in my bus to replace the fuel gauge sender either.
And I won't drop the engine.

&gt;     Hi &amp; welcome back, Yet again!
&gt; Thanks to all the folks at the &quot;Type2&quot;
&gt;     Now on to the problem at hand, I have a 77 Transporter (Automatic).
&gt; Every time I make a Left turn, I can see a trail of gas left behind as I
&gt; mosey on along.
&gt; Comming from my assumption the fuel filler neck. (I put on a new gas cap to
&gt; no avail)
&gt;     My problem is this, How do I get to the fuel filler neck without pulling
&gt; the engine or cutting into the firewall?????
&gt; Thanks to all &amp; Keep on Bussin!!!!!!!!
