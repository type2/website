&gt; Ok, i guess im the new guy.  

Hi.
&gt; 
&gt; i have a 68 Sundial conversion.  just got it, havent even seen it
&gt; yet.  my brother is a master mechanic and vw nut, he is fixing it up
&gt; to make the run from CA to MD.

I'm in Baltimore, where are you located?

&gt; he and i need to find some parts for it.  can anyone recomend
&gt; someplace?  im in the east so, web and/or mail order would be best.

Bus Depot is up near Philly and has good service and prices
&gt; 
&gt; im specifically looking for:
&gt; 
&gt; sliding door handle

inside or outside.  inside, lots of luck I finally made one out of alum
for my 78.  outside, I am pretty sure I have one lying around here
somewhere

&gt; turn signal assembly
&gt; ignition set up w/ keys

my nickle, if you can swing it, buy these new, they are such a PITA to
repair it is worth the extra coupla bucks to not have to worry with it.
