Hi,

&gt; The stock cooling systems are quite robust.  I know this because I pass a

 Yup, I'd agree with this. Things get more marginal in a genuinly hot
climate but the stock system is pretty sound if it's properly maintained.

&gt; I think that the &quot;top speed is cruising speed&quot; was mostly a creative way
&gt; to turn the vehicle's being underpowered into something positive.  It was
&gt; probably true of the 40HP buses, but as the engines got bigger it became
&gt; possible to rev them pretty fast in 4th.  ...

 Hmm, 79mph in top is under 4500rpm, by my calculations. That doesn't
strike me as excessive in a vehicle with a rev-limiter at 5200.

 It must be true that high revs will shorten engine life to some 
extent but I don't think the 79mph cruise is necessarily just
marketing. I would hope for reasonable longevity even in a bus
that's routinely driven at 75+.

Cheers,
