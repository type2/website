Subject: Re: [T2] 15w40

My old suzuki 550 road machine and my harley of olden days both wanted 
either 30 or 40 as their preferred with a multi as opional to be 
watched.  (the harley was an AMF piece of s&amp;&amp;t not the good machines)
That is mid 70's era.

If multi grade oils are so bad for air-cooled engines shouldn't we tell 
every
body with an air-cooled motorcycle to change to straight weight oil right
now?
