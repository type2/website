Subject: broken oil strainer bolt?

http://www.frontleftspeakerposse_dot_com/oil/

I was able to take a few pictures of what happens.

I tightened the oil strainer nut too hard and snapped the bolt.

someone mentioned maybe being able to unscrew the bolt part of it and 
just replace that, but it doesnt appear to come out. Do I need to take 
this somewhere to have it rebuilt, or have the case split to have this 
thing repaired?

I still can't believe I did that. ugh.
=(
