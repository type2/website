Subject: Re: [T2] Rotor Button? Distributor Cap?

Yeah it is perfectly legal then. That tool box is for heavy equipment and 
dump trucks and almost anything else on wheels or off or non vehicle 
or......you get the picture. It is not really mine I wish that it was. What 
a great place to store a couple buses =D! The owner is a good friend of mine 
and the Mechanic in our shop. He paid $30k for the box aloan $175K with the 
tools, all Mac and Snap-On. 1 of 6 in the country when he bought it 2 years 
ago. It stands almost 7' high. He is 5' 6&quot;....go figure. I think he has a 
special Snap-On step stool for it.

When I get my bus runnig I will drive it up here and take a pic with them 
lined up. I thinnk it is taller than my bus might be as long.

&gt;From: Mark Hineline Hmm, I think there's a law that states: no tool box 
&gt;should exceed the size of the vehicle the tools stored therein are kept for 
&gt;working on. Except that the law doesn't end with a preposition.

&gt;A bus might be bigger than this tool box, but not by much.
