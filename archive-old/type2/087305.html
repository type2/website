Subject: RE: [T2] Generator question on 71 Westy

Yep, that's it.  The letters &quot;AB&quot; at the beginning of your code means that it is a replacement case built since 1973 in either Mexico, Brazil, or Germany (according to my manual).  It is a 1600cc engine. This means that you have had a new engine installed, or at least they installed a new case. So technically, you have NEITHER an original Bug nor Bus engine, but a re-built engine from the case up, although they may have used some other bug (or bus) top end parts such as heads, etc..  This is the same code as my 71 Westy.  So the good news is that at some point in time you have had a complete re-build.
Hope this helps.
Peace, John Baker

John, 



There is a number stamped right below the 1-4-3-2 firing order and it's AB 796904. Is that it? 



Thanks, 



Trey

&gt;&gt;I heard that a bug generator is shorter  (also it's stamped 30
amps) and can cause problems. I'm thinking that the PO put a bug engine in the bus....&lt;&lt;



If it is a bug engine, then the generator will be the right one for the motor and cause no problems. To find out what your engine is from look at the code stamped on the base of the generator stand. Post that number to the list and I am SURE someone can tell you definitively if it is a beetle engine.
