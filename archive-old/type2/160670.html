Subject: RE: [T2] Re: Empi vs. Bugpack merged aftermarket exhaust for 77

&quot;The Pacesetter is what I generally ship under the below part number,
although on occasion I am forced
to substitute an Empi when the Pacesetters are unavailable.

Hey, if I have ANY friends out there in type 2 land, listen to my voice....

INSIST ON THE PACESETTER MUFFLER!!!!

That massive muffler with the plugged EGR filter pigtail is humongously
heavy and awkward and is has gotta be the EMPI.  I bought a Pacesetter from
Ron tons of years ago, and an muffler from S&amp;S Headers to check the
differences.  And I also got one that was made in Mexico. They were nothing
like the [possibly] EMPI I wound up with last October.

Two straight and strong men couldn't get that elephant on a stock '76
camper.  Of course it had to be bent so it could match the triangle heat
exchangers, but even with the bars I normally use, it wouldn't stretch
enough.

I saw another one a few years back, A. S. in University Park, Maryland, and
he told me two weeks ago that he was successful in getting that 'EMPI'
muffler on his Westy, but there is still a lot of exhaust noise from ill
fitting connection.  [But after he went to John Brown;s Buses last year, he
noticed that most ALL the bays had noisy exhaust, so he said 'fine, I fit
in']

I don't know HOW I could have misplaced that EMPI muffler in the past 3
months, but I guess I am just lucky....

I am only responding now because I saw Ron was watching.  I do want to keep
on his good side because I need to order some stuff from him....
