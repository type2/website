Alas my 71 westy has given way to rust.
I have already pulled the motor for the 67 westy I hope to aquire on monday.
it has the bed , side cabnet, table , passenger seat, good top, and an
assortment of mechanial goodies .
Mechanically this van was great so it has a lot of good parts on it.
I will ship small things . If anyone is interested E-mail me at
