Subject: Re: 84' seats in 77' bus?

Hey Alex,

I'm not sure about 84 into a 77, but I've always heard that vanagon seats
will easily slide into a bus.

However, when I actually went to a junkyard to give this a try it did not
work.  1) The passenger side of my bus does not have the sliding rails (it
only has a couple of hooks where the seat is inserted).  2) You can't pull
the rails out because they are welded in 3) The rails on the driver's seat
are of slightly different design.  On the bus, there is a thing that looks
like a comb that swivels down in order to lock the seat into place.
However, on the vanagon it is a bar that drops down to lock it into place.

I played and worked and pushed and tried to get them to fit (desparately
want nicer seats in the bus), but it was to no avail.  Now, I'm just looking
to buy some new replacement seats for my bus.

Until Later,

Darrin.

PS&gt; If you try to, remember to watch your fingers.  Its a tight fit in there
between the rails and the steering wheel and while trying to match up the
rails and get everything to slide in place you could easily mash/tear a
finger.  As me how I know :)

&gt; &gt; Does anyone know if seats from a 84' Vanagon westy

&gt; &gt; I would try and measure but the seats are for sale in another
&gt; &gt; state.

&gt; Hey there Alex,
&gt;
&gt; I've been interested in this swap for quite a while. This item is on
&gt; my want to do list (not need to do list).  Someone from Limbo told me
&gt; that the Vanagon GL seats will work also. The tracks are the same.
&gt; The GL seats are like the baywindow seats except that the cushion
&gt; material is made of foam, not that horsehair stuff. They even went as
&gt; far to say that the original seat material on the 79 (same seats as
&gt; your 77) will fit on the GL seats. So I'm guessing that the V'gon
&gt; westy seats will work too.
&gt;
&gt; The only problem is that if you want to keep the GL seats armrests
&gt; you have to cut holes is the 77's fabric so the armrests will attach.
&gt; (My 79 has the air vents running down the doors, so I'll only be able
&gt; to use the armrest on the walkthru side of the seats).
&gt;
&gt; The seat fabric comes off pretty easy. the seat bottom is attached by
&gt; a cardboard rim that is fit into a long slot in the seat bottom. The
&gt; tension of the seat springs keep it in place. The back is held on by
&gt; a couple of clips, where the seatback meets the bottom.
&gt;
&gt; If I'm wrong on any of this can someone please correct me ! (Karl ??
&gt; anyone ??)
&gt;
&gt; I haven't searched the archives, but the answer is probably in there
&gt; too. If this is correct, then this would be an excellent swap.
&gt; Upgraded seating, with original (OG, for vintage list members) seat
&gt; material.
&gt;
&gt; Hope this helps,
&gt;
