Okay folks, here's where we are at.  Note: this is a long post. If
you have no interest, DELETE now.

What you need:
a 80-83 Vanagon donor
heatsink w/module
distributor
harness from module to dist. to coil
bosch electronic coil (get one from a Rabbit -they work better
then the
Vanagon because of the heat they lived with before-Rabbits have
cooler
engine compartments)

On the harness there are 6 wires coming out of the module plug.
About 4&quot;
from the module is a single plug=this wire goes to the positive
side of
the coil. About 15&quot; from the plug the harness splits=the 3 wire
plug
goes to the dist.The brown wire is ground=it plugs onto the ground

terminal at the top of the case where it's bolted together (if
your case
doesn't have this,some Vanagons don't,use any good ground spot on
the
case). The fifth wire goes to the negative side of the coil.

There is a difference in the position of where the two
distributors
sit--this one is about 90 degrees off. On top of the dist. where
the cap
sits is a notch--this is where the rotor points for #1 to fire.
Set your
timing mark to zero and pop off your cap--your rotor should be
pointing
to this notch. If it's 180 off turn your crank 360 again-it should
line
up unless someone put your dist. drive gear in the wrong position.
Pull
out your dist. and drop in the new one-it will only go all the way
down
in one position (the slot is offset). Where the rotor is pointing
is #1
to fire. You can either leave it like this and move your plug
wires
accordingly or reset the position of the drive gear (preferred
way). If
you move your drive gear don't loose the spring on top of it. Be
very
careful lifting up the drive gear--it turns as you lift it--you
just
want to lift it enough to turn it.
There is a thrust washer under it that will fall into the case
(ouch).
You may have to do this a couple of times--put dist. in,see where
it
points,move gear,put dist.in etc.

The Vanagon dist.has a dual vacuum unit--if your engine has a dual
unit
hook it up the same way as it was=manifold vacuum (vacuum at idle)
to
the inner nipple, ported vacuum (vacuum when you open the
throttle) to
the outer nipple. Time it the same as the old distributor.

Benefits are:
-never change points again
-timing never changes (as the point rubbing block wears the dwell
changes--when dwell changes the timing changes)
-parts availability (the module and coil are in Rabbits and 4-cyl
Audi)
-coil output is always at maximum (dirty points lower coil
output).

Karl,

The below instructions don't mention the &quot;white&quot; wire from the
module.  I'm using an 83.5 wasserboxer donor.  I have changed all
as below and posted the results.  Could you take a look at your
bus and verify that there is a connection between the Hall module
and the ECU please?  Is it direct or does it all tie together at
coil 15 (negative side)

Thanks.

 Wire1  Black wire to 1 side of coil (12v side)

&gt; About 15&quot; from the plug the harness splits=the 3 wire plug

Wires 2-4 to Hall unit in distributor

&gt; The brown wire is ground=it plugs onto the ground

Wire 5 Brown to case

&gt; The fifth wire goes to the negative side of the coil.

Wire 6 Green wire, Large moulded connector to 15 side of coil.
(negative
side)
Wire 7 White wire. FI trigger?  Bentley shows it going to the ECU.

I moved plug wires.

I fitted the original 2.0 vac. unit.

New post.

The 79 Cal type2 and 80-83.5 Vanagon ignition modules only have 6
wires,
They do not have the 7th white one. This is also the same module
on
early Rabbits and Audis.

Sounds like you need this module and harness to make it work.
There is 2
80-81 Vanagons at a wrecking yard here in Fresno. I didn't pull
the
ignition set-ups off of them because I didn't have anybody asking
for
one. They are starting to get harder to get. Less Vanagons are
being
scraped.
