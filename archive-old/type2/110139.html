Subject: VW Taxonomist needed to ID engine

Hey volks,

I have a motor that I just cannot figure out. The PO told me it was a
2.0L, the machinest told me it was 1800cc, and I cant find the engine #'s
in any book or website. On both sides at the very bottom of my case the
numbers &quot;004 101 101A&quot; are inscribed. is that my engine # and if so what
is it?! also at the top center of the fanhousing side of my case are the
numbers &quot;CA 015 693 XG&quot; I think this inscription might be from the very
terrible GEX rebuilders but at this point I have no idea. Can anyone help
me out?
