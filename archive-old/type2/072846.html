Subject: Re: 911 bus: the long story (+webpage)

&gt;    I have two questions about the conversion:
&gt;`1. How long did it take to get the grin off your face after driving it?

It's still too early to tell :)

&gt;  2. Would you do it again?

As much as I love my bus, the lack of power, even with the 1800 type4
engine, bothered me quite a bit. I could have gone for a beefed up type4,
maybe even a Mark Stephens stage III, but I was skeptical: would the
cooling fan be sufficient? Is the distributor advance curve still
appropriate? What about the FI ECU calibration? On the other hand, I wanted
to stay in the air-cooled family, hence had the choice of either corvair or
911.

Now that I have figured out how such a conversion is done, the next one
should go much faster.
The thing about 911's is that they come in many different sizes and prices.
I opted for the small beginner model, a 2.2 and time will tell if the
engine swap was a good idea or not. If all goes well, and I have money to
burn, I might upgrade to a 3.0. The 2.2 might then go into another project,
I would love to have a fast (no, make that &quot;torquey&quot;) '68-'71 crewcab... :)

PS: I've put up a quick'n dirty webpage about the conversion:
