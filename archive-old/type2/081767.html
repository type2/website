Thanks Steve, I think I'll break out some 8 gauge and just make one.

&gt; &gt; Looking for one.  Know where I can find one?

&gt; Bill,
&gt;
&gt; I just took a micrometer to a bushing I had laying around, and it mic's at
&gt; 36.2mm, so head down to Sears and look for a 37mm open end.  If they don't
&gt; have that, then the (obsolete) measurement is 1.43&quot;, so a 1.5&quot; (obsolete)
&gt; wrench should do the trick.
