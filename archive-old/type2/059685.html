&gt; did you check the idle cutoff solenoid and assoc wire?

Right.  That's the other thing I forgot to mention.  I did test this
solenoid (ignition on, touching the wire to the connector and hearing the
solenoid clicking).

The bus warms up and runs great at higher than idle rpms.  And sometimes
it will idle at a very low, rough, almost cutting out pace.  And other
times, it just dies.

Where would I check for a vacuum leak?

Cheers,

Tom
