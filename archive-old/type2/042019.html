Subject: Re: a note on replacing the fuel tank sender

FYI...

I just removed the fuel tank from a 74 westy (for reasons other than sensor 
replacement) WITHOUT removing the engine.  I removed the carbs, linkage and 
fan.  I had to position the tank at just the right angle to slide it out over 
the motor, but it was not too difficult.

I see how it could be MUCH tougher if you have FI though!
