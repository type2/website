Joey-
Sears has two styles. $10 or $25
Get the $10 crank knob style, it fits in a tool box,
and is applied directly from the spring side.
The big C-clamp model needs a modification
with a grinder to clear the rocker box sides,
and you must have the cylinder head off to use.
Both have the infamous lifetime warranty.

&gt; Is there any other way of taking the valve springs off without using this
&gt; tool. Any method at all?? or is there anyone in the
&gt; arcadia/monrovia/pasadena, california area who has one and who would let
me
&gt; borrow/rent it from them? Thanks
