Subject: [T2] Fuel injector bracket???

I pulled my injectors out of my 1980 vanagon 2.0L. I bought new ones, but, 
they have a metal ring that holds them onto intake manifold. I tried to 
remove it to get them ready to put on the new ones but they cannot come off 
without destroying the plastic electical connection of the injector.

Do the new ones come with this metal piece on them or is this another VW 
puzzle I have to seek help on???
