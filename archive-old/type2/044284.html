Subject: [T2] Speedo modification....

I wanted a trip counter on my 77 Westy. So I figured I could use a 80-82
Vanagon speedo. The 2 screws holding the head to the back plate are in
different spots. No problem....drilled 2 screw holes and 2 guide pin holes.
Got a diamond bit and drilled a hole in the glass lens for the reset button.
No problem. One thing nice about the Vanagon speedo is the odometer, it is 6
digit. So I set it for my total miles : 257163. No problem.

Then I went to put the whole thing back together and the problems started.
Problem #1: The total thickness of the Vanagon speedo head is about 2mm
thicker than the bay head. The needle rests right on the glass. Ok, I will
add flat washers as shims between the backing plate and the plastic housing.
Took 3 on the 3 screws around the head to get the needle to move.
Installed cluster assembly.
Problem #2: The dial does not have enough space around the edge..... After
dark I turned the lights on and blackness!! Without the 2-3 mm space between
the dial and the housing.... the dash lights will not shine onto the face!

Reinstalled original speedo.....no trip counter......
