&gt; I consider myself very fortunate (thanks Tobin!) to have acquired a

&gt; much more into the Stewart Warner burners.

&gt; Can anyone help out with parts sources and/or repair persons here??  I know 

There's a place in North Vancouver called &quot;Beetle Spa&quot; that works on the 
gas heaters.  The head guy is Peter, and he gives first-class service.

One work of caution:  The glow-plugs cost about $80.00 (can), and they're 
the cheapest part on the thing.
