Subject: I don't want to part this Westy out...

... but I will if I have to.

For those who came in late, I'm selling my '73 Westy (pmail me if you
missed the original email and want a copy). It's only been a week since I
originally posted the email, but as I said I want to cash out quick.

*If* I part it out, ideally I'd like two sell it in two parts - the rebuilt
1.8 L engine with less than 1000 miles, and the rest (complete Westy sans
engine). I hate to do this, as it runs just fine...

Note that I will only sell the Westy AFTER I've sold the engine. If you're
interested, pmail me with an offer.
