Subject: westies in the woods

i just got back from nj in the 87 bus and just want to say it was one of the
best vw campouts me and my buddy have ever attended. only got to stay one
night but the weather was perfect the food was great and the winery tour 
beutiful.
then the great tunes around the campfire and meeting so many unique people.
we hit very little traffic and even pulled of 20mpg going there. this is a 
must
vw event for everyone next year.
peace
patrick
