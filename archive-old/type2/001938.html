Were going to set up a +ACo-stock+ACo- 1600 DP +ACo-in a 71 bus+ACo-  to run with the early
31-pact 3 carb +ACo-Part +ACM-113129029-H- as listed in Bus Depot catalog for
+ACQ-129.95+ACo- ..This is the same carb +ACo-I think+ACo- George Lyle said he was using on
his New Mexican 1600 DP. What are the advantages/disadvantages to using this
carb over the standard 34 pact 3 +ACo-Mexican Bocar+ACo-?

Anyone

+AFs-...+AF0-
