 Hi,

&gt;     I just bought some Vanagon brochures from '80 &amp; '81.  One of them
has is
&gt; basically about all the neat stuff that VW engineers did to update
the Type2
&gt; from Baywindow to Vanagon.
&gt;
&gt;    One paragraph states:
&gt;     &quot;The Vanagon body shell was designed with the assistance of a
computer,
&gt; using graphic projections.  All design data were fed into a second
computer
&gt; that controls a driving simulator.
&gt;    Aerodynamic work was carried out in Europe's largest climatic wind
tunnel,
&gt; the massive VW installation at Wolfsburg.
&gt;    After thousands of hours of testing, changing, and testing again,
&gt; Vanagon's drag coefficient was reduced to a mere 0.44.  This figure
compares
&gt; favorably with many sedans, and is below that of conventional vans. 
It
&gt; contributes considerably to Vanagon's fuel efficiency.&quot;

 OK, but I read somewhere that the baywindow's Cd is .38, and there's
also
the fact that the Cd is only half of the equation: the other half being
frontal area (bigger on the Vanagon).

 I'm probably wrong about this (I can't cite any references to back it
up)
but it is my current understanding of the situation.
 For empirical support I refer to the posts indicating that equivalently
powered vanagons have lower top speeds than baywindows (eg 1600dp 50bhp
compared to 1600 diesel at 50bhp). Anyone have a top speed for 1970cc
aircooled vanagon to compare to a baywindow (VW cite 79mph)?
