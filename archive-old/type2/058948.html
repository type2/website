&gt;&gt; Well, what's to stop you from tearing it off yourself and tossing 
it?.....End of problem. &lt;&lt;

Not quite.....

In many, if not all, US jurisdictions &quot;unauthorized disposal&quot; of asbestos is a 
serious offense carrying at minimum a significant fine.  Just tossing it in 
the trash usually constitutes &quot;unauthorized disposal&quot;.

It might be prudent to inquire about local regulations for asbestos.  Since 
brake and clutch shops deal with the issue daily they'd be an information 
source, but the local refuse utility should have the definitive word on the 
subject.

I've worked with the stuff off and on for decades, and agree that there's been 
a certain amount of overreaction, but it can cause serious health problems if 
handled unwisely.
