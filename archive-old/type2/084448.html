Subject: RE: [T2] 77 Muffler

I'll try to get the stock type. My bus used to have some cheap aftermarket 
muffler and
it did not fit right, leaving it without heat.... Changed the muffler to 
stock and now we
have heat (as much as you can get from stock heat ;-) ).

On another note, I didn't know BusDepot had a listmember discount. How one 
does get it?

Rogelio

&gt; &gt; I need a new muffler. What's an inexspensive route.
&gt; &gt; Can Midas or some outfit like that do it?
&gt;Possibly. But first you need to know what you're dealing with.
&gt;Does your present setup look like this?

&gt;If so, and only the muffler itself is bad, then you're looking at $75 for a
&gt;brand new European made replacement from us (to give you a basis of
&gt;comparison).
&gt;However, if your present system lacks all of the piping shown, then you
&gt;probably have an aftermarket extractor system on your bus now, not a stock
&gt;muffler. In that case, you'll need another extractor system (which we also
&gt;sell for $75 with listmember discount, our part number 352000). I'm not
&gt;sure Midas would carry something like that.
