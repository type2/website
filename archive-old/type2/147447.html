Subject: Bluetooth in a bus?

I really hate talking on a phone, but with four kids and multiple trips 
upcoming in camping season I seem to be on the phone more and more. The 
corded ear buds are ok, but tend to get in my way, so I have recently 
considered getting a bluetooth device. Does anyone have any suggestions 
for having this type of headset in a noisy bus. I ran across this device:
http://www.behandsfree_dot_com/ProductInfo.aspx?productid=PINCK1008

which claims to have noise cancelling and echo suppression. I wonder if 
anyone has used such a device. If I can communicate with someone on the 
other end of a phone and have them hear me I sure like that. Or in this 
environment would a standard headset work just as well? The main thing 
for me obviously is to keep it hands free as driving our old buses every 
day takes as much attention and observation as possible.
