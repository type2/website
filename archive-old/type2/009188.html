Volks,

My stock distributor appears to be shot--the timing at idle jumps, dwell 
goes up and down with the rpm, and the max advance is too fast.  Does anyone 
know of a source for the stock distributor?  I've heard they are 
prohibitively expensive, like $400.  If so I'm thinking about putting a 
cheaper 050 or 009 in, anyone have success with either with a similar 
engine?  According to the type2 library, the 050 has an advance of 26.   So 
with the idle timed at 7.5 the overall advance would be 33.5 is this too 
high?  Do i need to retard the timing a little to use this distributor?


THANKS

matt
