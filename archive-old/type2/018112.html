&gt; Here's a boner I pulled this month.
&gt; 
&gt; Progress on the '76 Wety restoration was progressing nicely; sandblast
&gt; down to metal, reprime with DP-40, call Ron at Bus Depot and tell him to
&gt; ship me one of everything, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Engine doesn't look worth saving, the PO drove about 10,000 miles
&gt; without any cooling system integrety, so I ordered a -new- AVP engine
&gt; through the Bus Depot.  I took the engine number off the fan housing and
&gt; asked for a '79, just like mine.
&gt; 
&gt; Sandblasted all of the cooling tin, replaced the missing ones and welded
&gt; in patches where the PO took 'short cuts' with tin snips instead of
&gt; removing things.  I even bead blasted the fan housing, etched it and
&gt; painted it body color.  Put everything together on the engine stand.
&gt; 
&gt; I just tried to put on the exhaust headers and it would appear that the
&gt; '76 exhaust is incompatable with the '79 heads.  There are castings tack
&gt; welded to the exhaust headers that allow an inch or so of the header to
&gt; stick up though the casting, and on the new engine the studs aren't
&gt; anywhere close to reaching through the cast ears.  The mounting surface
&gt; on the new engine is just above the top of the pushrods.  I am seriously
&gt; bumming.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm going to drink a beer, then go down and measure to see if cutting
&gt; off the tubing that sticks out above the casting with ears will make
&gt; everything line up heightwise.  I welcome anyone's experience/insight in
&gt; how to fix this mismatch of my own doing.
&gt;

Scott:

Well, you can either get a different exhaust system or different heads
(or whole engine). If Ron would do the switch thru AVP and the freight
isn't a problem, getting a 78 style engine might be the easiest.
The 49-state 79 heater boxes are probably superior to the 75-78 style,
however, because they're larger (like the 72-74's) and also the square
ports have much improved gasket design. If you can get past emissions
people, the best plan in my judgment would be to use 79 heater boxes and
a 72-74 muffler (which eliminates the crossover and y-pipe). This is the
muffler that I prefer to use on 49-state air cooled vanagons also. The
front lower sheet metal is slightly different as is the piece that
covers the bottom. I have a set of barely useable 79 heat exchangers
that could be patched if you are a good welder and have more time than
money. The freight would be the biggest part of the price, probably want
$10 each. I've also probably got some or all of the 79 style tin.
Ron may sell 79 heat exchangers, probably around $300/set.
