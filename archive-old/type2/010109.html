Subject: Free Pre '75 Westy Sink, in Austin, pick it up
Message-Id: &lt;199907121503.IAA31900_at_scv4.apple_dot_com&gt;

Hi all,
     Moving. Found stuff. Don't need it. Want it?

;-)

Found 3 hubcaps for the 5 lug wheels ('70 and earlier) and the westy sink 
cabinet, for the Pre '75 westy (the one that sits behind the seat. Gotta 
go get it, the wife and I are basically gone from the state at this 
point. Got about 'till the end of the month to get it if you want it, 
pmail me for details. Couple of folks on the list in Austin, if you want 
to work a deal to have 'em ship it or whatever, but Sam and I are gone. 

Anybody in Sacramento, drop me a line, maybe we can hook up after we 
settle down out here...


Peace,
