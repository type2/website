Subject: Re;73camperFS $6000

Just to jump into a facinating conversation.  Value is local.  I was beginning
to think the Van might be worth what was being asked until I read the downside.
Cracked windshield and bad paint are two big negatives.  The other negatives
also should be completely absent.  The old car price guide has this van in a
range from $550 for a parts car up to $14,000 for a showroom car.  According to
the guidlines I'd put this in a categorie &quot;4&quot; ie: a driveable vehicle needing no
or only minor work to be functional...It may be in the process of restoration,
but from 20 feet away there is no doubt that it needs a lot of help.  Price for
this car in this category is $2800.
for a value of $6000 you'd need a categorie of  &quot;3...&quot; ie:  All presentable
inside and out, at twenty feet it looks perfect.  Inside there are some signs of
wear...In general most cars seen at car shows are no. 3's.

But hey! if you can get your price, more power to you......John Jensen in
