&gt;I disagree that you need a temperature gauge. The german engineers felt
it
&gt;wasn't needed, and if it was, they would have put it in. A
well-maintained
&gt;engine won't overheat. If your engine is getting hot, a temperature
guage
&gt;won't solve anything. If your engine runs hot, don't drive it, figure
out
&gt;whats making it hot and fix it.

Certainly it is true that if all of our engines were rebuilt by guys
named Hans in Dusseldorf, maintained by a mechanic of direct blood
lineage to Mr. Porsche and driven by those German engineers, probably we
wouldn't need temperature gauges.

Alas, I got my '78 a year ago and don't know what's been done to it in
the intervening twenty years.  Does it run hot on 105 degree days while
climbing long hills (a common condition in Germany)?  Sure.  Am I gonna
tear that puppy down and figure out which  bearing is out of spec?  Not
so much.  But if I stick a $50 temperature gauge on there, I think I
have a good chance of getting some miles out of it until a) it blows up,
or b) I pass it along to someone else who repeats this process.

The omniscient German engineers neglected to put a lot of things on my
bus (though they saw fit to equip the 914 with said temperature gauge).
At the risk of violating some sort of list spirit, we're not talking
about Porsche 356s here; a lot of us rely on our busses for daily
transportation and can't afford to put it up for a couple weeks or pay a
mechanic to go on an overheating fishing trip.
