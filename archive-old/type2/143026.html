Subject: Re: [T2] Compression check

&gt; I can't find my resources for checking the compression on a 1700. I had a
&gt; procedure and some specs from some web site, but can't find either.


Cold engine: Remove spark plugs, oil threads, and reinstall not quite as
tight as normal. Warm up engine. Remove ALL plugs. Put compression gauge in
the holes (I do 1-2-3-4 in order, but it doesn't really matter as long as
you keep track.) Using remote starter (or assistant turning key) crank
engine. Watch the gauge. After 3 revolutions or so it should stabilize at a
number.

If compression is low on one or more cylinders (more than a few pounds
different from the others, or all below 95 lbs) squirt a bit of motor oil in
the offending cylinder and try again.

Is that what you were looking for?
