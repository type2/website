Subject: Re: [T2] Yet another Roadtrip!

Greg,

Way back when it was the norm to work on your Bike for two days , ride
for one.
Maybe.
Be it an Indian, HD, Triumph, BSA, Norton, AJS, Brough Superior,
Henderson, Vincent, whatever.

Things changed in the late 60's.

Do nothing to the bike , turn the key and ride.

Things changed in the automotive world too.

Oil filter's got added, a heater and a radio was now standard equipment, 

The engine wasn't considered old at 40,000 miles, and materials are used
in the interior so you don't have to use plastic stick on your back seat
cover's to make the interior last more than 3 years.

It's called built in reliability &amp; longevity.

The engines now go 100,000 miles with a regular oil change, ---no plugs
or points required.

No valve jobs due to far superior materials.
No valve adjustments every oil change.

Lets face it.

The VW's are much like the old US and English bikes of yore----

Work on it a week---drive it a couple of days, and hope nothing breaks.

What really amazes the heck outa me is that the Kraut's are very low on
the totem pole of customer satisfaction.
Consumer reports list's Audi / VW, and then--the old bullet proof
standard Volvo as the worst of the worst.

The Land of The Rising Sun who blew the motorcycle industry apart back
in the late 60's still smokes them all with Honda and Toyota way up on
top---

I have to say that playing around with the VW's as a hobby is a fine
thing to do--and is a bunch of fun.

But to depend on one for reliable transportation on a daily basis is
much like keeping that Indian ( Royal) Enfield on the road for your
daily driver.

Now how bout a Renault Dauphine for an everyday ride?
