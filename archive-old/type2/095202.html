Subject: Re: [T2] re: Westy extinguisher size? Halon


&gt;OMG! i just read the rest of your post... i didnt realize it had been
&gt;discontinued!!! CRIKEY! that sucks... they always take away the good
&gt;things, man! oh well,

It is my understanding, that your local firestation will refill your halon 
extinguishers.  Look around for a used one.  What's the concensus here, 
listees?  Who still has their halon extinguishers from the 80's?
