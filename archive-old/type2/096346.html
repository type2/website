&gt;    I am not in the best of spirits right now since my Bus is sitting in my 
&gt; back yard DEAD....I have a question that I want as many people to answer or 

as they say, BTDT, not a fun place

&gt; just give me some thoughts on my situation. I had my 1800cc engine rebuilt 
&gt; last Fall I took the engine out brought the engine to this guy (who will 
&gt; remain nameless) He is a very reputable VW Mechanic. He rebuilt the engine 

at this point I would question the &quot;reputable&quot; part.  everyone makes a
mistake, it is what you do next that seperates the reputable from the
shysters.

&gt; for me and a few weeks later I picked it up...I brought it home put it in 
&gt; and then began to break the engine in. To my dismay it was leaking oil so I 
&gt; brought it back to him and told him my situation. He said &quot;oh its probably 
&gt; just on of the push rod tubes&quot; he said he would fix and then I could come 
&gt; back and pick it up. Well when I went back to pick it up he said he had some 
&gt; &quot;BAD NEWS FOR ME&quot;. He told me that there was a hole in the block and that he 
&gt; did not notice it when he was rebuilding it. He said that he would put some 

????? any mechanic that rebuilds an engine and misses a hole would have me
worried from the get go.  What else did he miss??  and why didn't he see
the leak when he tested the engine, he did test the engine didn't he?

&gt; begining. Now I am out about 1600 dollars and have a engine that has hole in 
&gt; the block. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? I like the mechanic but I am in a 

how much of all this is in writing, and ask him, &quot;if I get another block
would you swap the parts (new bearings) at (little or) no cost???

&gt; before it is rebuilt... I feel like I have been screwed over a bit because 

yeah it sounds like it too

&gt; he never said that it was his fault or apoligized to me. And he never even 
&gt; offer to give me a break and help find a new block and give me a break on 
&gt; the labor. ...GUYS PLEASE HELP ME? Give me some input as to my legal rights 

for legal rights you probably should discuss it with a lawyer, I took a VW
shyster to small claims court and won the max, now collecting that money
is another story.


a possible short term solution though. 
  I have oil heat in my house and that means an oil tank, occasionally
they will leak and that is the ultimate mess in a house,  well they make
special from the outside oiltank repair plugs.  it is a spring loaded
&quot;T&quot; shaped head with a large seal and flat plate on the outside along with
a nut to tighten it.  it might work depending on where the hole is. BUT I
would consider this short term only.

good luck
Bob
