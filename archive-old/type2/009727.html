Steve,

The valve has been replaced this winter.  It was leaking and really
messing things up and I already tried unplugging the valve's plug.
No change. :(  I haven't checked the power to the aux. air valve
yet.  That'll be next weekend.

Thanks!

&gt;  Un plug your cold start and see if the idle stablizes.  If so check your
&gt; Thermo Time Switch.  If not it still may be that your cold start is
&gt; leaking.  Undo the tubes leading to it and by pass the cold start to see if
&gt; this corrects it.
&gt; 
&gt; Test with a warm engine.
&gt; 
&gt; Have fun

Oh, I AM having LOADS of fun. &lt;1/2G&gt;

Mark
