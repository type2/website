&gt; 
&gt; Just a few observations...
&gt; 
&gt; First of all, that's 4-6% at the driven wheels, as in, what you might
&gt; observe on a chassis dyno.  The HP gain at the crankshaft (where that 60hp
&gt; is measured) is probably more...  possibly not much more, though.

heh, that would mean the gain is less then... for argument sake, if the
drivetrain saps horsepower, assume 50 hp at the rear wheels, leading to a
net gain of 2.5 hp.  I would assume, however, that the horsepower sapped
by teh drivetrain is pretty consistent, and doesnt change from dyno run to
dyno run.

&gt; Secondly, the &quot;e-ram&quot; as they call it, also provides a corresponding
&gt; increase in torque, which is arguably more important to the bus owner.
Increasing torque in a bus motor is much easier than increasing HP i'd
think.  If you have a dual port with a header, go to a single port with a
stock bus exhaust and a carb with a smaller venturi, maybe some smaller
valves (modified 40 hp heads perhaps..) torque o-plenty after that, but
your high RPM performance will suffer mightily, hehe.

&gt; Of course, nomater how you look at it, it's only a small gain.  One would
&gt; probably be better off just getting a real (crankshaft-driven) supercharger,
&gt; which would produce more like 5-15lbs of boost.  Then again, increasing
&gt; manifold pressure (and therefore compression) in a gas engine shortens its
&gt; life.  Maybe it's just better to drive slow.

I guess my point was that the vw engine has many things one could do to it
before adding such an electric supercharger... Things that will increase
your power more than it does, and can be used all the time without taxing
your charging system beyond its limits...

take care,

Steve

p.s. to be fair, they tested it on a big v8. on a little 1600 it might
produce a bigger power gain as the blower doesnt have to overcome as much
CFM of engine vacuum to start creating positive pressure.  It could create
a higher positive pressure on a vw, but i still wouldnt buy one unless i
just wanted a toy to play with.
