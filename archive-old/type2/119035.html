&gt;Subject: oil cooler tin seal
&gt;Message-ID: &lt;BC658D3B.9D71%ratwell_at_mac_dot_com&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I removed this seal in order to paint the tin it was attached to. What's a
&gt;good sealant to use to reattach it?
&gt;
from ggm

I use building construction type Silicon caulk. I use the big cheap full
size caulk gun type cartridge. You have to read the label carefully. I want
the pure 100% Silicon sealant with no acrylic additives. I even use the
silicon alone to replace some missing  tin air flow seals. However, I would
never totally replace this oil cooler air flow seal with only silicon. This
seal is  really important seal for the oil cooler. It is designed to endure
all that heat and seal the air flow in the area without crushing the
delicate oil cooler fins. If you bend those fins, you seriously block
crucial air flow. You cannot dismiss a tiny front bend as unimportant
because it looks like a small blockage. One tiny bend in the front blocks
ALL the air flow through that portion of the deep oil cooler. For this seal,
I &quot;float&quot; the factory seal on a thicker than needed layer of silicon. I do
not put silicon on the seal surface that touches the oil cooler. I just put
silicon on the back side of the seal and in the seal lips that hold the seal
to the tin.Then while the silicon is still wet and flexible, I install this
piece of tin with the factory seal gently but completly touching the surface
of the delicate oil cooler. The extra silicon just gushes out and the seal
is positioned exactly where it is supposed to be and there is still some
flex from the built in design of the seal. If you study the seal you can see
that the seal was designed to be self adjusting. A brand new seal is very
flexible and is designed to flex to adjust the tightness of its pressing
against the oil cooler. A 25 year old seal is stiff and has lost most of its
&quot;reach&quot;. In my opinion, the silicon positions the seal to make up for the
loss of original &quot;reach&quot;. Additionally the silicon seals the back side of
the seal lips that have lost their ability to tightly grip the tin. I have
never seen any deterioration of silicon used in this area after examining 10
year old rebuilds. And I have not seen crushed and blocked oil cooler fins.

You have to have a completely clean grease free surface for the silicon to
stick. I wash the rubber seals in hand dishwashing soap and rinse well. The
silicon sticks real well to a new properly painted surface. Or I use a
completely evaporating solvent to clean greasy tin before applying the
silicon.

I know I am going to get flamed for my wild idea of totally replacing some
tin seals with silicon, but I have never had a problem doing so. The silicon
does not burn or melt at normal or even abnormal overheated engine
temperatures. It will &quot;burn&quot; in an engine fire and dry up and crumble away.
The silicon does not aid in combustion; it just crumbles away. You cannot
use caulk tube silicon on the exhaust pipe part of  the heat exhchanger.I
have tried, but it crumbles away right were it touches the exhaust pipe. I
suppose the remaining glob of silicon does help seal the remaining air flow
and you do get better than nothing gain. You can use it to seal smaller
holes on the outer tin of the heat exchanger. I even glue all my tin
together with a thin film of silicon. It is much harder to take the tin back
apart.But I don't care, I rebuild an engine to last 10 years. The silicon
makes the tin stay together. Air flow is sealed. The tin does not rattle or
rub a hole if a screw comes loose. To dissassemble, I just slice the silicon
with a razor blade knife. I actually think the silicon is a much better seal
than some of the factory original seals in some applications. In the late
upright engine with the doghouse oil cooler there was a terrible black foam
seal that rotted away right away. Since the cooling air had to be forced
through the restrictive air channels of the oil cooler, a small perimeter
air leak would allow most of the air flow bypass the oil cooler. Of course,
at this location you have to be very careful with the silicon application.
you just want to seal the area, and not let the uncured silicon flow around
and block crucial air flow passages. Actually the silicon is very easy to
form correctly because it is pretty thick to start with and sets up firm
pretty quickly. I am not saying that you can replace all of the tin seals
with the silicon.
