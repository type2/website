Subject: Junkyards with a reasonable drive

Greetings--

I currently am living in Indianapolis, and here in the home of NASCAR and the Indy 500, there is a marked lack of resources for my thirty year old imported 'wagen.  I fondly remember the days back in Columbia, MO where I would venture to the junk yard, wave hi to the old guy at the garage and proceed back to acres of junked vehicles.  Once I had pulled off whatever part I needed, I'd mosey back up to the garage, have a cup of watery joe and shoot the bull for a bit, then pay whatever the old timer wanted for this or that, usually within the bounds of a twenty dollar bill.

I wonder if anyone out there knows of any good yards with sadly decaying bays (with lots of nice stuff still in them) in the neighborhood of Indiana, western Ohio, northern Kentucky, Illinois, hell anywhere within a two or three hour drive.  Feel free to pmail.  Thanks!

Charles
