    List Members,

This may sound like a real stupid question, but here
it goes anyway. I was wondering where you put the
winshield wiper fluid at. From my guess there is sort
of a tank like nozzle sticking out like a sore thumb
on the passenger side. Upon closer inspection it says
HELPHOS, and it does screw off, is this where the
fluid goes or am I way off the mark? I was also
wondering if anyone out there knows where some
junkyards are located in the San Bernadino/San
Fernando/Kern areas? There are 2 local ones here near
where I live here in Apple Valley Ca. Not too many
places to find parts for the Bus out in the desert.
Thanks!
