Hi Volks!

The dirty pictures of the dirtier bus were taken at our meeting too.  
The bus was driven through the Sahara desert in Marocco (sp?) several 
times, and according to its owner most of the dirt is from there :-)

Interesting bus anyway, featuring heavy-duty suspension (available 
from VW for increased load), single-wheel handbrake levers, and 
various other off-road goodies.  The owner, Michael Knappmann, has a 
home page (in German) at
http://www.fo.fh-koeln_dot_de/~michaelk/vw_bus_d/mein_bus.htm
where he describes the features.  This page will reappear redesigned 
at www.bulli_dot_org some day... when he &amp; I get around to it.  :-)

About the roofrack, no idea - but ask him, if you wish.  I think he 
does understand English.  Tell him I sent you.

&gt; Disgusting!  You should be ashamed putting this trash on the web! This
&gt; is worse than the site offering &quot;100 Naked Chicks&quot; that had gif after
&gt; gif of infant chickens!
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, what kind of rack is that?  I've never seen one around here.
&gt; Looks pretty heavy-duty, judging by the number of mounts.

Yours,
    Erik.
