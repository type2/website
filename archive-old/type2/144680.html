&gt; My lines also came from NAPA and the rear ones were too long.

It's the front one I'm having trouble with.  I can't seem to bend the 12&quot;
ones I found at NAPA so they're not in the way.  I'm also having trouble
finding a replacement in the Denver CO metro area.  Should any break
place be able to cut and re-flare a break line for me?  Is there an
inexpensive tool that will cut and double flare a line?  I think it's
about 6&quot; or so is all I need.
