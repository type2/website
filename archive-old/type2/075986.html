In response to the debate on whether to split the case or not....in my =
experience, if you have the engine torn down to the case it may be =
another 10 to 20 hrs to check, order parts, rebuild etc.  Consider the =
time and effort spent if something is internally amiss, and you slap it =
back together.  Towing, vehicle downtime, frustration, and the =
possibility of repurchasing destroyed new parts.  Case in point, in 10 =
years of customers' stock type IV motors, the only time I ever saw this: =
 1980 Vanagon, voice on phone (borrowing from the Maestro) says its =
running rough and wont make it up the &quot;mountain&quot;.  OK,  thinking I know =
what that sounds like, aka dropped valve.  VOP- but I just had the =
engine &quot;rebuilt&quot;  3 weeks ago with new pistons and heads.  Hmmmm.  Upon =
pulling the heads number three exhaust  dropped, no revelation.  Pull =
off the P/C's and low and behold #3 piston is completely scuffed on the =
&quot;front&quot; (Miur) and skirt is hammered on adjacent side.  Cylinder is as =
well.  Bent rod.  Evidently the engine had dropped a valve on # 3, and =
smacked the piston.... the previous mechanic did not bother to check the =
rods. Rebuild time.  A waste of parts, mechanics' time customers' time =
and benefits no one in the long run.  Funny to see that Westy 8 years =
after loosing touch (owner moved off island and sold it) checking =
Westies for sale for another customer.  Engine compression still great, =
front end shot, rusty, FI ripped out..dreaded progressive installed, in =
generally poor shape. Moral of story: At the very least check everything =
three times...its much more economical in the long run.
