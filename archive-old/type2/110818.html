&gt; ...I recently found a very nice

&gt; full-on, Bug-style belly pan.  I politely said &quot;No, sorry, hijos de la
&gt; man-yana - not gonna pay $75 for a COVER!&quot;.  The cashier had some hurried
&gt; and furtive discussions with the next cashier and I was then promptly
&gt; charged $10 or $12 for it.

A doghouse fan shroud is indeed a &quot;fan shroud&quot; and can usually be had for
10 bucks or so, just like the plastic thing behind the radiator on a
Chevy!
