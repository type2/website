&gt;According to the Sermons of Bob Hoover, I should be able to run a new ground

&gt;I can't.
&gt;Has anyone been successful in this?

I have.
But I pulled everything out of the bus first.  8o)

&gt;I do not find where the wire exits from
&gt;the column around the steering box.

It comes out the bottom of the steering column, through the coupling disk,
and grounds under one of the bolt heads of the coupling flange.  Now, I
just don't know WHY Bentley couldn't include this in the steering column
assembly diagram.  8o|

The wire that would lead to the horn connects to a male connector on the
end of the column tube.

&gt;I did run a ground to the horn button and &quot;Beep-Beep&quot;  Anyone suggest how to
&gt;by-pass the column?

I just did this to get mine on the road.  You need to attach a momentary switch
somewhere--mine is clamped to the column tube.  One side goes to ground, the
other to the non-hot side of the horn.
