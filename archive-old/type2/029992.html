&gt; Hey George, I thought I was the only one who admits he lifts his rear by

I only use this point to lift for doing CVs, and only lift enough so that
the tire barely clears the ground.  I also make sure that I'm lifting the
casting, not the shock or stud.

For any other lifting action, I use the torsion housing and jack stands.
