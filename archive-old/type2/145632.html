Subject: Re: [T2]tire broke inward this morning on me (update)

ok its off but now i need another bolt for bottom of sway bar and of course at least another clip for the bushing i MIGHT be able to get the bracket straight again.... 
   
  that thing was not coming off i can look at it now... there is no way it would slide on that.. it was rusted completely.....
   
  so at least its off and now i am up against finding a new sway bar bracket/clip and a bolt... eeerrrggggggg......
   
  but i did finally get it....
