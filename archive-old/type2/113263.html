Subject: Who did my conversion?

Hi Folks,
Has anyone heard of a company called &quot;Spirit?&quot; I'm asking as I 
purchased a 1977 VW Camper High Roof that had this company do the 
conversion &amp; I wanted to learn more about them! There is a single spot 
that identifies this as a Spirit conversion. It is on the cabinet 
behind the driver's head. It is nothing more than a little square piece 
of paper identifying the conversion. it is taped down on the cabinet 
using a spot of wide, clear tape.

The interior has cabinets, a bed, sink, a cook top, fridge, etc. the 
cabinetry looks to be a fake dark walnut with the &quot;contact paper?&quot; 
pulling away from whatever is underneath it.

I've uploaded a few pictures at my yahoo briefcase. Go here:

then select Public

then select 1977 High Roof

Thanks in advance for your help in identifying the conversion company...
