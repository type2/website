????? sounds awfull high, is that just parts or labor too, brand new parts
are less than half that cost from some of the businesses that post here
and used injectors are redily avaliable.  i alway reccomend changing the
cold start valve but that is 74.95 at Rocky Mountain but I paid less than
half that for my last new one.

&gt; Anyone have comments about fi to carb conversions...I'm thinking 
&gt; maybe dual Weber 34ict?  Anyone moved from a working fi to carbs and have
&gt; comments?

Don't!
&gt; 
&gt; Gas mileage and driveability comparisons and comments welcome.

fuel economy is about the same, but driveability is no where near as good
and it is a lot harder to keep carbs working right
&gt; 
&gt; I had a 72 with solexes on it at one time and was *very* happy with
&gt; them...I can fix carbs on the side of the road(never had to though)...but
&gt; trying to fix fi on the side of the road does not appeal to me....I have

much less likely to  leave you on the side of the road.

&gt; had a borrowed fi camper die on the road after a long camping trip...I was
&gt; only 15 miles from home though.

bet it was something other than the FI that broke.

I've had both and the learning curve with FI is no harder than carbs but
it is different.  the big difference once you get the FI working you can
almost forget it, just doesn't need all the constant fiddling that carbs
do.
