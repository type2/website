Just picked up a 2.0 liter engine ('77) for my '72 Riviera. Unfortunately, the heat exchangers on the '77 are toast.

The &quot;engine-in-a-box&quot; that came with the '72 had a decent pair of heat exchangers. I understand that these will bolt right up to the '77, but that I'd need to use the earlier exhaust with these.

Does anyone out there know why this might be a bad idea? Has anyone done this (fitted early heat exchangers and exhaust to late bay)?

Thanks! Joe
