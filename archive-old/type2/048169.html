I went to a reputable upholstery shop and they would actually reupholster
the seats for less money than just to purchase the kit.  I am going to go
this route instead.  That way I can do some custom fabric.

Hey Guys,

Just curious if anyone has ever used one of the seat repair kits, the ones
that come with cushioning and hog ring pliers to basically re-upholster your
seat?  How difficult is this project?  Are the results worthwhile?

Thanks for your input.

Sincerely,
