I'd hold out for a 77,78 or 79 fule injected
model.
You'll have a safer bus, more available parts and
a car that'll do 75+ on the highway.

I've had mine for 2+ years. Trust me it matters.
And, don't expect much for 900 bucks. Unless you
plan to put $1000'S into it.

Hello everyone!   Just dropping a line to
introduce myself, and to say
hello.  I'm new to the bus world, just having
recently fallen in love with
the functionality of the VW Westfalia, and am
going to buy a bus in the
next couple of months.   I have an opportunity to
check out a bus this
evening, a '69 Westie (price of $900).   Since I
really don't know much
about years/makes/models and their various
qualities, I thought I would
first ask the general question:  &quot;What do you
think of the '69?&quot;   Also,
the guy said that there is some rust both on the
doors of the bus extending
down to the rocker panels underneath.  I think the
rust has eaten through
the body.   Any ideas of prices to replace the
rocker panels on a '69, or
links where I could find parts prices?

I also had the idea of taking some pictures of
this bus and posting them to
a web page to solicit comments about any potential
problems that might be
visable.   I told the seller that I would like a
week to think it over
after seeing the bus, so I have the time.

Anyway, if you want to say hi, or have any
thoughts about the above, feel
free to drop me a line in private.    Thanks so
much for providing a great
resource.  I'm looking forward to being a type 2
owner!!!!!
