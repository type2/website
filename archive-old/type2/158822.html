Subject: Stored engine advice

HI folks.

I haven't posted here in a long time. Long story short - I had a  
1.8l  engine fail in my '74
westy about four years ago and decided to take the opportunity to  
start rebuilding the bus
at that time. I bought a newly-rebuilt engine from Bus Depot about  
three years ago and had
the rear end of the bus ripped apart and then I lost my job, was out  
of work for several months,
and when I did get reemployed it was at substantially less money.

In other words, I got into the project and the money dried up.

Now I'm at a point where I really need to get the bus running again  
(as opposed to previously just wanting it to run again) and will need  
to compromise on some of the work I wanted to do to
get it back on the road, with plans to finish the rebuild later.

My question right now is this: I have had this newly-rebuilt engine  
sitting around for over three
years. When it arrived I checked it over, put it on a palette, and  
wrapped it up completely with
that saran wrap like stuff used to secure things for shipping. It's  
been sitting like that all along,
in an outbuilding, safe from the elements but still subject to  
Pacific Northwet winter temperatures
and humidity.

I'm looking for advice as to what I should check on it before trying  
to put it in service - should I
just take the heads off and check the cylinders for rust or should I  
go deeper?

I'll have some other things to ask about later. I need to do a little  
body work and that's not going
to happen until early next month as I'm waiting for a tool that I  
need to complete that work so I
thought I'd start working on the engine in the meantime. I'm hoping  
to get the bus back on the
road by the end of August.

Thanks for any thoughts on the engine, and I have to say I'm happy to  
be working on the
bus again.

--Stephen
