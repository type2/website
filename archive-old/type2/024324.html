Thanks for all the advice.

I'll have a look at the ignition systanm and the #2 temp sensor and see if that does any good.

The problem seems to occur when the engine is warm - usually after we have been cruising for 80 - 100 km - it then feels as if the whole engine dies and comes back to life sometimes forcing us to stop and wait a minute or so.  This makes me think of ignition problems before the distributor or something else.

A couple of questions - if there is an erratic problem like the grounding of the #2 temp sensor, will I be able to spot it when the problem is not actually happening?

Also, Steve Blackham sent me some very detailed test instructions - thanks heaps - are the numberings of the pins consistent on different in different models? If i need to chase up a numbering plan is there somewhere on line or will I need to chase a hard copy of a manual.

I let you know how it goes.
