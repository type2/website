Well, I did &quot;catalog&quot; those parts I have in the shed:

All parts for 77-ish bus (muffler/heater boxes don't fit on a 79 engine)

- muffler and both heater boxes, in very good condition (triangular
connectors between boxes and muffler) -- I don't believe the heater boxes
have been used 
- transmission -- works fine 
- everything for a fuel injection system, except the injectors (may be
there -- I didn't see them)
- 2 drive shafts with good rubber boots
- several headlights
- 2 halogen, 2 amber lights
- instrument panel
- sliding door lock
- flywheel
- 1 louvered window (minus one pane)
- 1 sliding glass window
- 2 large back windows
- misc other engine parts

These are in South Bend, IN. Make an offer for the works.

                 I wish I were half the man I wish I were.
