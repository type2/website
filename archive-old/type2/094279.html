Subject: Help me find an Oil breather hose

The day finally came: my oil breather hose is ruined and I'm stuck (luckily
I'm at home).  I tried the 5 major FLAPS in the area but all they have is
3/4&quot; radiator hose.

Can anyone provide me a source for 22m or 7/8&quot; hose.

This is the state of my hose.  It's the original and the braids have no
strength and the rubber went hard.

&gt; Richard,
&gt; 
&gt; I don't have the ID of the hose, but the OD of the barb it fits on is 22mm
&gt; (~.87 in.)  OK,  my micrometer actually reports 22.14, but there is  bit
&gt; of rust.  *IF* (at that is a big one) you could find 21mm hose it would be
&gt; perfect.  20mm is probably the OEM spec and it woudl be a tight fit.
