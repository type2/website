Subject: Re: Charging Westy Auxiliary Battery

The aux. battery is normally set up via a relay to enter charging curcuit
only when ignition is on, so whatever is hooked to it doesn't drain your
starting battery when car is parked.  All you need is a wire from its
positive to positive on starting battery and make it SWITCHABLE.  This
means either a simple switch or get a relay that taps off the the ignition
wire to coil as the primary circuit and switches in the wire from each
battery positive. The aux. battery can die prematurely if deeply discharged
(will sulphate)- get a DEEP CYCLE battery.!  MB
