Subject: RE: [T2] Using the Bus Depot part number search engine

&gt; This does not tell me why your search by part name
&gt; still does not work!!


Actually I did address that issue. As I wrote:

&gt; You may find the part this using the part number 
&gt; search even if you couldn't using the context-
&gt; sensitivesearch.  Most likely because we do list
&gt; the part, but do not have application data entered 
&gt; for it (so it is not coming up in the context-
&gt; sensitive search). This was the case in the 
&gt; example that you cited.

This part does not have any vehicle application data attached to it in
our database. (If you click on it, you'll see that where it says &quot;You
can find this part in...&quot;, no data follows that header.)  So even though
YOU may know it fits your bus, the website doesn't know that yet.
Therefore it will not come up in a context-sensitive search that is
looking ONLY for parts that are coded as fitting a specific year. In a
perfect world every single part in the database would have vehicle
application data on our site, so they would all come up in a
context-sensitive search. But in the real world, with almost 200,000
parts to code, this will take years and will almost certainly never be
complete (although I keep plugging away at it day by day...). So
meanwhile, those parts that do not have any vehicle application data
attached to them will come up only if you search using the left side
search box.
