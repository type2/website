Subject: Got the westy home!

Hi Volks,
Finally got the 70 westy home safe and sound.  It ended up that the
ignition stuck and the starter  burned up.  Thanks to Bob who met me at
I-83 and gave me a loaner starter.  The starter is in and the bus ran
like a top on the 50 miles home.  The bus can be seen at

I'm pretty excited.  The bus needs some TLC but is surpisingly
complete.  I have all the camping equipment, infant cot, curtains, and a
VW of A maual. The canvas is in decent shape.  Needs rockers, a drivers
door, and an engine lid without air vents  ;0)
First roadtrip planned?  Everybus 2000.  See you there.

Jamie Auch
