Subject: spare tire mounts

bus folks,

I'm going to mount my spare on the front.
I see a couple different styles at widely varying
prices. And have seen some home-made solutions.
Any recommendations? Things to watch out for? 
(Haven't been able to find one in the wrecking yard,
so I might actually have to buy something new.)
