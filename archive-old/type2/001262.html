We are about to take our 76 Westy out camping for the first time this
weekend.  We want to take my son's bike so we are in need of a bike rack.
Preferably one that goes on the front but would clear the spare tire.  Any
recommendations?

     Also, any ideas on how to hold a 8' X 10' foot tarp to the the bus?  I
have some aluminum peice that bolts to the drip rail.  It is obvoiusly for a
tarp or tent.  It goes about 10' along the side of the bus.  Thanks for any
ideas.
