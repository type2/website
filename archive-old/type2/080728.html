Subject: ADMIN: -- Kill This Thread Re: [T2] Anyone on Yahoo Groups READ THIS OR YOU WILL GET A LOT OF SPAM (No VW Content)

Ah, the irony.  Now the spammed has become the spammer.

The problem with your message is that it has no VW content.  Even in the
subject line it says &quot;No VW Content.&quot;  Since that is the case, under no
circumstances should you have posted it to the type2 list.

Please see this little quote from the Type2 list charter:

--Do not EVER post virus warnings, or messages about important issues
that you think should concern everybody in the world. Do not post
messages unless they have legitimate bus content. If you think the
message you're sending is so important that the &quot;bus content&quot; rule does
not apply to you, that means that you should ==NOT== post it.

The charter is conveniently available for viewing at http://www.type2_dot_com

Please consider this thread killed.
