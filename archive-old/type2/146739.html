Subject: Re: [T2] Re: diagnostic plug - can one measure compression
  test?

Something I forgot to mention - I have acquired various bits of paper 
from 1973, and they are pretty consistent that the compression was 
measured using the diagnostic socket. This seems to rule out measuring 
the starter motor current, unless the computer connection also included 
a clamp style ammeter.
