Howdy Y'all!
It being Friday and all, I thought I would take the VERY LAST opportunity for a moment of shameless self-promotion (via the list) before the big event next week.  Confirm those travel plans now, the VW Buses 'n Boats Bash just north of Cincinnati, Ohio is next week, May 18-20.  We now have 26 buses confirmed for attendance (not counting my own '66 Camper and my '73 Westy that a friend is going to drive).  I have conferred with God, Jah, Allah, and Buddha and they have assured me that the weather will be excellent (it seems Jah drives a bay! I always thought him to be the split window type!)  But, just in case we have a large shelter reserved in case it's not so dry.  Just a reminder, Event activities will include an 8 mile canoe trip on the National Scenic Little Miami River and LIVE MUSIC in the campground on Saturday evening.  Details at http://www.geocities_dot_com/buses_n_boats  or you can contact me personally for more info




Peace, John Baker
