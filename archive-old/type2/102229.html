Subject: Re: [T2] fuel injection problem

Hi Chuck,
    The national system has 4 fuel injector voltage dropping
 resistors, one for each  injector. Your system  maybe has
 a bad resistor, wire, or connection where the cable plugs
 to the resistors.  My the way + battery power originates 
at the resistor block.  The ecu grounds the fuel injectors 
to activate them.

&gt; I just finished installing my 2.0L federal emission
&gt; engine back in my 79 Westy and everything is good
&gt; except that there is no charge getting to the #4
&gt; injector. I did a continuity test on both of the wires
&gt; from the injector end to the computer plug in end, and
&gt; it all checks out good.
