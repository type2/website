&gt; Hi all
&gt; I have been staying up to date with the list by reading
&gt; the archives and I finally had to resub, I just couldn't
&gt; take it!! (WITHDRAWL) So I pull off my drive shaft to
&gt; replace the boots on my cv's and I am having trouble
&gt; removing the circlips on the outermost part of the
&gt; axle. Any hints??

I am sure you have gotten a reply by now, but I will throw my $.02 in
the pot. Go to your local FALPS, and get some Circlip pliers.  Shouldn't
run you more than 10 clams.  The 2 screwdriver method described in the
Idiot book, as at best a pain in the ass.
