&gt; You prob. all have been over this before on the list
&gt; from time to time, (please bare w/ me)
&gt;
&gt; Motors out, cleaning, adjusting, torqueing top cyl.
&gt; heads etc.
&gt;
&gt; Went to adjust #2 cyl. valve the valve closest to back
&gt; of bus,(dont know if this is intake or exaust).
&gt; the pistons toped out, and the adjusting screw is
&gt; backed out, but my gauge will not go between rocker
&gt; and valve stem.
&gt;
&gt; i pushed this in by hand to experiment, and im able to
&gt; push this in with effort, but the other 3 valves next
&gt; to it are very hard..
&gt;
&gt; what gives?
&gt; keep in mind i just got this bus running (rather
&gt; roughly) after it sat w/ PO for last 7-8 yrs.
&gt;
&gt; do i have to replace valve? can i live w/ this? I just
&gt; put new exaust, torqued everything, dont tell me I
&gt; have to remove the head...
&gt;

This sounds like the exact symptoms I found on an Ebay Westy I drove to 
Chicago to pick up and drive back to Minneapolis.  It had an B block 
engine, block painted gold, with chrome MoFoCo valve covers on dual 
port heads.  Weber progressive carb, Bugpack 'quiet' header exhaust, 
Cal-bus Bosch electronic ignition, total hack job of installing a 
doghouse cooler setup.

I proceeded to change the oil and adjust the valves before driving it 
the 350 miles to Minnie.  When I got to the exhaust valve of the #3 
cylinder, I couldn't get any clearance, no matter how much I backed out 
the screw.  And the damn thing even ran fairly well in this condition.  
I had brought tools, and the seller let me use his floor jack, so out 
came the engine, and off came the #2 head.

The problem?  A dropped valve seat in what I suspect was a MoFoCo 'Big 
Valve' head.  The heads had the original part numbers machined off, and 
no identifying marks.  Going by the valve covers, the color of the 
crankcase, and the proximity to Milwaukee, I decided that MoFoCo was 
the likely guilty party.  The guy had probably overheated the engine, 
what with the shitty cooling situation in a heavy poptop Westy, and the 
MoFoCo headwork couldn't take the strain.  The wonderous part is that 
the valve didn't break off, in spite of pounding the seat back into the 
head a zillion times.  There were even some marks in the top of the 
piston, but no holes...

It was a Saturday, but I found a place called Spencer's Home for 
Battered Bugs in Addison that had a new head and all the misc other 
parts I needed to get the thing together.  Took me the rest of the 
evening and into the next day, but I got it back together and drove it 
home to Minnie.

Now I'm finally getting this thing going again, after letting it sit 
for the two years since I bought it.  Last week I pulled out the brand 
X stereo and installed an NOS Blaupunkt bus dash speaker and bracket, 
and then a Sapphire AM/FM in the proper spot.  Next I fixed the gauge 
cluster (speedo glass had fallen out of place), rewired the rear 
defroster (missing wires) and rear interior light (dead short had fried 
wires inside the ceiling), and installed a used ice box liner (was an 
empty cabinet when I got it).  I just pulled the engine and gas tank 
(bad sender) yesterday, and all the drums today (brakes down to the 
metal on both right side wheels).  Now I will finally install a new #1 
head to match the #2.  The bitch is finding another 040 101 375Z head 
to match the one that Spencer sold me.  I tried calling Spencer's, but 
the phone is disconnected.

Anyone have a lead on a new 040 101 375Z head?

Thanks in advance,

Kabayo
