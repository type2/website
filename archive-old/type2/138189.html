&gt;Trying to dream up ideas on how to dress up the top of my dash in a 1980
&gt;Vanagon. The PO had drilled holes all over it to mount who know what. Thinking
&gt;of doing something in fiberglass that sit on top of the dash (bolted or
&gt;screwed to top of dash) that would also make room to mount my guages.
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone have a web site illustrating anything like this?

I bet this is exactly what you are looking for:
