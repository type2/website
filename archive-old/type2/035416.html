Michael,

Thank you for your excellent reply. I will check the archives as 
you suggest.

The salesman at Jacobs, by the way, informed me that I would get 
the JC Whipme price, something about drop-shipping through them. 
He did the common salesman trick of putting me on hold and 
supposedly talking to his supervisor. Having been in sales, 
whenever that happens to me, a giant red flag goes up. 
Also, the salesman's explanation of how the unit worked did not 
make a lot of sense. Added to your bit of knowledge about the 
amount of current that it draws, and the fact that I have
no desire to add an alternator to the puzzle, strengthens my
decision not to purchase the unit.

Bob
