&gt; &gt;As to a new pedal, it does not look good.  VWofA reports
&gt; &gt;that accelerator pedals for busses are no longer available.
&gt; &gt;BusBoys does not have one.  RMMW does not have one.  And
&gt; &gt;with the bracket welded down...
&gt;
&gt; I watched David Easterwood do this to my 68 last January. (This ain't too
&gt; elegant, but it's held up fine).
&gt;
&gt; Go to the hardware store, get a barn door hinge. A little less wide than
&gt; the pedal. Take the broken pedal and the hinge to a muffler shop. Ask them
&gt; to cut the hinge about in half (take the points off it).
&gt;
&gt; Then, have them weld one side of the hinge to the pedal such that the
&gt; geometry stays as close to the original as possible. Show them, don't tell
&gt; them. Those folks ain't too bright sometimes.
&gt;
&gt; Take the &quot;restored&quot; pedal back to the bus and bolt the free side of the
&gt; hinge to the floor. Mark it and drill holes, then bolt straight through the
&gt; floor. My floor is rusty, too, but there was enough there to bolt to.
&gt;
&gt; I think this all cost about twelve dollars including the welding.
&gt;
As an even cheaper, easier alternative, just bolt the hinge onto the pedal as
well as the floor. Ive done this in my last 2 busses with no problems...
