&gt; Can I use my Volvo 850 Turbo Wagon and a tow bar to
do this?&lt;&lt;

I once towed a 66 bus 300+ miles with a tow dolly
behind my 4 cylinder 1.8 liter engine Subaru wagon.
(with engine, tranny, and drivetrain still
intact)Luckily the wind was at my back the whole way.
I am not claiming this was a smart thing to do, only
that I did it!  My guess is you will have no problems
with the Volvo wagon.
