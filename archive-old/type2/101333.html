Subject: Re:  fuel pump

It is possible (just did it twice on my 74). However, it depends on how
badly corroded you tin screws are. You need to remove the piece of tin
that supplies warm air to the air cleaner (looks like a duct that runs
vertically right next to the fuel pump). In my case I only got three out
of four screws and bent it a bit. You need to remove it to gain access
to the top screw. Get two new paper gaskets and possible also the
plastic spacer thing. The spacers break easily and re-using the paper
gaskets does not work (see the oil all over the back of my bus ...).
Make sure you have to correct bit for the job - cannot remember whether
it is torx or triple square.

Subject: fuel pump

Is it possible to get at the fuel pump in a 72 bus with the stock type4

engine, with the engine still in? I thought that i had heard some
people 
talking about how it was but it was a major PITA. Thanks
