Subject: Wheel adapter?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.GSO.4.10.9905241627370.20755-100000_at_larry_dot_cas.utk_dot_edu&gt;

I have just discovered that most places simply don't have an adapter to do
anything for my wide-5 bolt stock rims on the '69.  As I am in active
search mode for a Thing as a second (fourth?) car, it seems wise for me to
acquire and stow one of these adapters in case of any emergency.

Anyone know where to locate one or something similar that works?  I really
need new tires.  

TIA!
