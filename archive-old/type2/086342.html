Subject: flame vs. heat switch

 
I asked the question:

Guys, what exactly is the flame/heat switch? Are we talking about a sensing/detector type device?

Bob answered:

yeah, no flame causes fuel to shut off.

The reason I asked is because someone suggested substituting a thermal (I assume meaning &quot;heat&quot;) switch in leiu of the flame switch. What I can tell you from doing fire protection for a living is that flame detectors are used in very sensitive situations (around generators/open flame) and are high speed detectors.

substituting a thermal switch (read: slower) may not be a good engineering decision when you're talking about personal safety with these heaters.
