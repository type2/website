Subject: Leaking brake fluid

Howdy y'all,

I'm losing brake fluid on my '69.
I replaced the master cylinder last month. It's the
one that has a secondary plastic reservoir on top of
the master cylinder and a primary reservoir under the
dash.
It appears to be leaking around the seals where the
secondary reservoir goes into the cylinder.
Has anyone else had this problem? How did you deal
with it.
