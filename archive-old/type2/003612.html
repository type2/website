Also has anybody else thought or gone through with installing the heater
somewhere else besides the engine compartment? I was thinking maybe under
the z-bed. I don't mind drilling out an exhaust hole,etc.  and it looks like
that would be much easier than drilling into the firewall. Also that would
give me more options on where to put the fresh air and maybe I could reroute
the heat output to the front AND rear too. Would the fuel pump pull from the
engine comp. to the z-bed ok? Is the heater strong enough for 2 different
output vents or is it so strong that one vent in the middle of the bus will
heat the whole bus real easy?

Thanks for the help so far and to come!

&gt; &gt;Hey list. Hope everyone is having a good weekend.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I have finally received my Eberspacher BN4 heater and am getting ready to
&gt; &gt;bench test it and install it. I still need a couple of things if anybody
has
&gt; &gt;them for sell or some alternative suggestions:   the recirculating vent
and
&gt; &gt;tube that goes above the driver's side rear wheel. I have the white
plastic
&gt; &gt;from the heater up to the fresh air intake, but not the metal? or the
&gt; &gt;plastic vent. I also am not sure how to intall these.  I also need the
&gt; &gt;switch or knob to turn on the heater. I know some came with a timer  too.
I
&gt; &gt;have the metal ducting that comes up under my z-bed, but not the venting
or
&gt; &gt;plastic vent. Has anybody else played around with a different way of
putting
&gt; &gt;heat to the front of the bus or another ducting system? Lastly I need the
&gt; &gt;cable to regulate heat from under the driver's seat or a good
alternative.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I have read and re-read the library articles from Ron and Casper, but
didn't
&gt; &gt;see any &quot;patterns&quot; they refer to. If anyone has any info on installing
the
&gt; &gt;BN4 I would love to know!!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks a bunch.
