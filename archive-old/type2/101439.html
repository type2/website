&gt; I seem to remember in the BN4 article from Ron Van Ness that
&gt; he stated that a standard VW bus defroster switch, the green
&gt; one on the dash, would work for the heaters? Aren't they like
&gt; a 30amp switch or something like that? I very well may be
&gt; wrong, just thought I had read that somewhere.

well I melted one of those switches YMMV

&gt; On the exhaust thing, the exhaust pipe that came with it was
&gt; pretty much shot and the clamp was non-existant so I bought 
&gt; one of those flexible exhaust pipes from autozone. It fit 
&gt; nicely around the existing stub that the normal exhaust 
&gt; clamps onto. It of course had a standard U-bolt clamp to snug
&gt; it down tight. It's a little short though. I don't have access

take a short piece of straight pipe slightly smaller and slide it into the
flex pipe and clamp it at the right length
