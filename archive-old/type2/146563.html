Thanks to everyone who wrote to me. Biggest advice... check the fuel.
Even though it was running for a few seconds didn't mean I was getting
fuel.
Well lo and behold... I pulled the rail off one side and sure enough, no
fuel. So I went through the Bentley test proceedure first for the double
relay. As of last night I thought that was the problem, but this morning
I double checked, reconnecting the ground near the double relay (the one
that goes to the fuel pump) and everything thing checked out ok. So... I
then jumped the fuel pump to make sure it was working, yep, buzzz and I
could hear fuel being returned to the tank. So, I did the test light
test on the injector connectors and it's dead. No flickering or
anything. So, as of this morning I'm thinking maybe I have a problem
with the ECU? As I said yesterday the guy who owned the bus before me
swapped colors on the battery so when I went to hook it up, logically I
put the red on + and black on -, so I reversed the polarity. Maybe I
fried the ECU when I did that? Anyway I'm going to do more checking this
weekend. If anyone has any suggestions as to what might be causing the
injectors to not get a signal to fire, let me know, so I can check that
out. The Bentley directory tells you how to test the voltage but doesn't
say anything about what to do if you don't get a flickering light at the
connector.

I also have a major oil leak by the cooler, damn it all. That should be
FUN to fix.

Thanks
