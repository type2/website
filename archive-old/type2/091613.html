Subject: Re: [T2] Painting muffler

If anybody finds something that works I could sure use the info.  Couple 
years back i tried everything i could get info on to try and paint a bug 
exhaust.  The only exhaust I have ever had success with was a cherry 
bomb.

&gt; I don't want to be the bearer of bad news, but prep as you may, and
&gt; paint with what you want, the paint just isn't going to stick, on a
&gt; exhaust system.
&gt; Why?
&gt; Don't know.
&gt; The heat just turns the paint to dust after awhile and it will flake
&gt; off. ( even VHT )
&gt; The only thing I know of or am aware of that will stick to an exhaust
&gt; system is ceramic coating them, and this process isn't cheap.
&gt; Painting them with anything will give you short term results.
&gt; Have fun,
