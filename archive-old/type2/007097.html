Speaking of stereo...Much as I usually disdain much of what is sold at Radio 
Shack, I was
suitably shocked at the sound quality of their Linaeum-tweetered small 
speaker...More
so when they were 50 per cent off. When they go on sale again, I think I'll 
try and figure
out a way to wire them into my Bus...8 ohms though...tsk.
