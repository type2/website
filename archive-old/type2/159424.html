Subject: Re: [T2] Adjusting FI mixture without an EGA

&gt; to have a spare for long trips.  I'd still like to have the absolutely
&gt; best performance and fuel economy that I can get and if that could

scrap the stock setup and hook up the megasquirt.  You'll actually be 
able to control your AFR.  It was amazing how easily I passed the smog 
test, and I think my egr was clogged, too.

&gt; If the mixture adjustment screw is primarily there for idle, how can
&gt; you dial in the AFM?

by adjusting the spring tension of the flapper door.  You have to pop 
off the lid and use a screwdriver and twist the big wheel a few gear 
teeth at a time.

&gt; Temp sensor #2 is good.  Where is temp sensor #1?

It's integral in the AFM.  If I remember correctly, the bentley explains 
how to test it.
