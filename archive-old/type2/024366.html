&gt; ... I have ... decided
&gt; instead to source out a new set of alloy wheel rims and lower profile
tyres,
&gt; thus, achieving the same effect, or nearly, and the desired look.

 Which effect? Lower profile tyre should reduce sidewall squish in a
turn
but will not lower the centre of gravity unless you reduce the overall
size of the wheel+tyre quite a bit. This will obviously impact gear
ratio
(at the rear) and speedometer accuracy (at the front).

&gt; Well, how low.....and how wide ?
&gt; are there limits ?e.g.: 16 &quot; wide rims with Pirelli P6's ?......and
does
&gt; this mess with your speedo ?

 If you look at the way-kewl kustom buses, they run some very low
profile
rubber. This looks flash but the general concensus seems to be that it
doesn't work too well for driving... and driving busses is what this
list
is all about.

 The main issues are (1) The bus steering box is quite fragile. Low
profile
tyres and fat rubber increase the strain and lead to premature wear.
(2) Ultra-low profile tyres just don't work that well on busses. I don't
have a good explanation of why this is the case but it seems pretty
widely
accepted. My guess is that the combination of high centre of gravity and
unsophisticated suspension mean you just don't get the benefits you
might
expect and have to live with tough parking, tramlining, aquaplaning,
poor
ride etc.
 Couple this with the fact that fat tyres decrease wet weather grip and
it looks like it's best not to go too far, unless you tow your bus to 
the showground.

 As far as speedometer accuracy is concerned, you just need to ensure
that the overall diameter of the front wheel+tyre remains the same.
This is known as &quot;plus sizing&quot;: &quot;+1&quot; is a 1&quot; increase in wheel diameter
coupled with a 1/2&quot; decrease in tyre sidewall height (there are two
sidewalls per diameter), &quot;+2&quot; goes up two inches on the wheel (14&quot;-&gt;16&quot;)
and decreases the sidewall height by 1&quot; etc.

 If you want to make a modest change, you can go to a +1 setup with
a 15&quot; wheel and run 195/70R15C tyres. This reduces the sidewall height
a little and gives you a slightly fatter tyre. The same wheels could be
used with wider, lower profile tyres, too: 205/65R15 is the same size.
 The next width isn't as neat: 215/60R15 is a bit smaller than stock
and 215/65R15 a bit larger.
 I havn't researched the options for 16&quot; wheels, but the same principles
apply. There's a good bit of info in the archives (check the vanagon
ones,
too) on the topic.

 The final, and important, point is that bus tyres need to be 
substantially stronger that car tyres. This is particularly true if 
you actually want better handling. Most low profile tyres are designed
for lightweight, sporty cars (this may be less of a problem in the USA
than in Europe, mind you) and won't have adequate load carrying capacity
for a bus.
 You need a weight capacity of over 1500lbs for safety, and more than
that for a good stiff sidewall. Tyres have a load index on the sidewall
and for a bus you want something like 97S (730kg/1609lbs) or better 
(good van tyres are often 100 or more). The letter is the speed rating 
(S=up to 113mph) and generally isn't an issue for a bus :-).
 Eurovans use a 195/70R15C tyre, they will be strong and relatively
cheap. Once you get over 195-section most of the tyres available in
adequate weight ratings (look for &quot;reinforced&quot; tyres) are for big, 
powerful saloons/estates and they get a lot more expensive. You're
typically paying for a 140mph speed rating you don't need.

&gt; Also, will any 5-stud wheel fit....._dot_can anyone suggest a happy and
&gt; attractive combination ?

 There are a few possibilities, though none seem to be perfect. You need
a wheel with a 5-stud pcd (Pitch circle diameter) of 112mm. This matches
a few fords, some Mercedes and some of the bigger Audi and VW saloons.
 You can also get adapters to fit Porsche wheels to a bus- some folks 
say that adapters are always a bad idea. Others that good adapters are
OK, and the Fuchs wheels are so good (strong, light) that the
combination
is worthwhile. Genuine Fuchs wheels are expensive, copies are dangerous.
 Unfortunately you also need to get the relationship between the tyre
centreline and the hub correct. For a bus the &quot;offset&quot; is 41mm. Some
of the Mercedes wheels are correct. Some are close (I don't know how
close it needs to be) and I don't know about the others.
 Finally, few of these cars have a hub that's as big as a bus and the
profile of the lugnut seat needs to match.
 Depending on your situation, you might be best to work out how big you
want to go, check you can get tyres to match and then hunt around some
breakers yards for wheels that fit. Check the offset carefully before
trying them and then make sure you can fit them OK.
 You can, of course, buy new alloys from an aftermarket wheel supplier.
If you go this route I would not trust the fitter to know what they are
doing with a bus: even if they've fitted alloys to a bus before it was
probably for someone who wanted them for show use not driving.

 Finally, the steel rims that VW used are actually pretty good. They
are lighter than many cheap alloys and lightness is a good thing in
a wheel (unsprung weight). 

 I hope this is helpful, sorry it's so long but I still feel I've left
out a lot of important detail!!!

Cheers,
	W.
