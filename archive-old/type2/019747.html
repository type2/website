Hi Shawn,

I just looked at a spare 79 steering gear in the garage.  Mine has a red
plastic plug on an upper flat immediately to the passenger side, right side,
of the connection to the steering column.  Shown as a circular spot on the
upper portion of the steering box on page 23, chapter 2 &quot;Front axle&quot; in the
Bentley manual.

You may need to use a mirror to see it.

&gt;      My steering box on my 79' bus has a slow leak, so I want to fill
&gt; it, but can't find the oil filler spot.
