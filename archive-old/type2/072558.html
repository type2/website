I recently removed an overhead A/C unit from my 78 Champange Transporter which had the York compresser.  Ive replaced the cut-away tin however, I still have a large hole in the engine compartment on the drivers-side sheet metal lip wear the engine seal seats.  Does anyone have any suggestions on how to fix this?  Also, I have several holes into the cab of the bus from A/C lines that need to be covered.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  

Chad
