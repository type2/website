Subject: Re: [T2] Heating with water - seeking what-if-ideas

I checked my U.S. Boat (?) catalog and they had a suitable (almost) pump 
for about a $100 but several others with no temp ratings in the $30 range.

I'm a cheap skate so I would probably be inclined to try the cheap one first...


&gt;Home systems pumps handle the hot water fine, but are all 120 volts AC, so 
&gt;need
&gt;to look for boat stuff.
&gt;I really like the water (anti-freeze, of course) based system a lot better 
&gt;than
&gt;the oil.



Ciao!
