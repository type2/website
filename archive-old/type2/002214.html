-

tell me do some Kombi engines cope with unleaded petrol and then
just on fifth fill with leaded. I saw a list of this in a volks shop i
wondered if anyone has actually done it



This of course was the hot topic in Britain as leaded was phased out. We now
have stuff called LRP (lead replacement petrol) to help out owners of older
vehicles which require lead, and I understand that there are a very few
garages still entitled to sell leaded.

But at least 3 years before that, I made the switch to unleaded on my 79 2
litre, with no problems at all. No change to the timing, nothing.

VW air cooled engines at least from about 1968, and probably a fair bit
earlier never needed it, so no worries.
