Subject: Decel Valve

&gt; Steve: Please let us know the symptoms of a failing or failed decel
&gt; valve. I for one would find this helpful.

The way the decel valve is supposed to work:

When manifold vacuum rises to over 20&quot; (when you take your foot off the
gas) the vacuum coming thru the small hose pulls a diaphram in the can
open and allows air to flow from the big hose around the throttle to the
intake air distribution box.  This prevents an ultra-lean condition on
deceleration and lowers certain pollutants (NOx, I believe).  It also
accounts for the lack of &quot;engine brake&quot; on FI buses.

What fails:
The diaphram leaks or tears or the spring weakens.  When that happens you
get air bypassing the throttle all the time and you idle speed gets higher
and higher. PITA.
