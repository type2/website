Subject: UPDATE: Re: Vacuum leak check

I found a link from Richard Atwell's site that suggested 3PSI.  I
cranked my compressor back to 3PSI as accurately as possible.  I don't
find any leaks but I can hear air passing constantly.  However, I
don't see any bubbles from the soapy water test and I don't feel any
air unless I disconnect a hose.  Should the throttle body and AFM be
air tight?  I suspect not but, at 3PSI, I'm not sure that I'm going to
produce enough pressure to create bubbles if the air is passing freely
back through the Air Flow Meter.  I could block off the inlet of the
air filter assembly but, I'm not sure whether that would create an air
tight setting.  I suppose I will try it.

Thanks, again, in advance,
Ken

&gt; I replaced the accelerator cable in my 77 FI Westy this passed
&gt; weekend.  It ran better than normal which I'm sure was some sort of
&gt; anomoly (not that it doesn't normally run pretty well).  However, it
&gt; smells to be running rich and I am having to massage it to get it
&gt; going out of a dead stop.  Under load, at higher RPM's is seems to be
&gt; running pretty well though maybe not a smooth as normal.  I have a
&gt; hunch that I either knocked something loose to bump a hose that was
&gt; ready to go any way.  So, the question is:  How do I perform the
&gt; compressed air vacuum leak check?  I have a compressor and I'm just a
&gt; bit concerned that I might damage something if I just start blowing
&gt; the blow gun into the plenum.
