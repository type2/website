Subject: Re: I need help with a dry bake system.

&gt;but I was wondering if anyone could tell me the correct procedure for
&gt;getting the fluid to fill up the system.  I tried just filling up the
&gt;reservoir and pumping the brake pedal but nothing really happened.  Should
&gt;I just bleed each wheel like a normal bleeding operation?

It takes a while to fill it up (I've wondered before what the actual volume
of all that tubing is). I hope you have a lot of brake fluid (like, two
quarts).
1. You're purging air, replacing it with fluid, so put the end with the
fluid downhill if you can so the air can indulge its natural inclination
and rise. I know it's an iffy proposition moving the bus, but if you can
finagle it pointing downhill a little, that's a good thing.

2. You want to push the pedal hard, sort of snap it down, then let it come
back up slowly. Snapping it hard makes the fliud less likely to &quot;trickle&quot;
underneath and trap a little air pocket in a bend somewhere. You want the
fluid to surge forth with vigor and virility, pushing the air before it. ;)

3. Do the tube-and-jar thing described in books.

4. Don't even think about turning those ridiculous litle bleeder valves in
the back with a 7mm open-end because you will surely round them off. Why,
why, why did VW use those idiotic little valves?

5. Start with the farthest wheel (RR) from the cylinder and work toward the
nearest (LF).
