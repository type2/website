Subject: Re: [T2] rpm and dwell meter

   .Mike Benthin in NJ asked:

&gt;Do you need any dwell meter, really?

	I recently tried to close the net to similar effect.  Good 
msg O mighty Bohm-admirer



&gt;Dwell is HOW LONG - a function of the gap in the points at the 
&gt;highest point of the lobes.

	and of other, normally slow-varying, influences (e.g shape of 
cam, state of fibre heel, etc)

	Recent archives tell all  --  well, much  -- on dwell.


&gt;   So with a simple voltmeter set to continuity buzzer (or even a test light)

	My favourite by far is the AM (pref battery) radio tuned 
off-station  -  that noise will be punctuated at contact-break by the 
same phenomenon exploited by Telefunken for the first U-boat 
transmitters.  A spark emanates radio, and your points will emit most 
freqs of radio when they break.  It's only a tiny spark (if your 
capacitor is OK) but can be picked up on any 'free' AM freq.
	Feeler gauges or similar concepts are stupid by comparison. 
Forget them.  Your Unca Robt, so rarely dogmatic, is getting totally 
imperious here.
