The pieces in question are to be inserted in the case halves where the
through bolts go. You  should have removed them when you split the case for
cleaning and disassembly. They tend to make mating of the case halves a bit
tougher than the type 1 case, but by no means should they be left out. If
you are not assembling the bottom end of your motor then you dont need em.

&gt; They are plastic. and have a hole in the center about as big
&gt; as a pencil and shaped like a football made out of little
&gt; cooling fins(there not to cool it ,but look like cooling
&gt; fins)and about 3/4 of an inch long each.

&gt; &gt; &gt;What are these plastics things and where do they go? They
