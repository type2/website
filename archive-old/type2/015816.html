&gt;I've just finished an overhaul of my 1980 VW vanagon 1800cc engine. When

&gt;couldn't find the reason why, so I consulted several mechanics, the
&gt;Bentley, and finally decided to mount the engine as it was, tightening
&gt;the distributor mounting screws as best as possible. There were a slight
&gt;click sound as the distributor shaft was pushing upwards.
&gt;
&gt;When I started the engine, it didn't have any problem. I've been driving
&gt;it for several days without a problem.

&gt;Is this normal? What are your experiences with this?

There is a spring that pushes up on the distributor - it's normal.  I put
an extra spacer under my distributor drive gear (two total, to bring it in
line with Wilson's rebuild specs) which made it spring up even more (maybe
3mm) but it hasn't hurt anything after 50,000+ miles.
