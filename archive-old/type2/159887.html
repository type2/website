Subject: Re: [T2] VW and righteous indignation...

I just DELETED most of this.  I look at this list to learn about my 
self-restored 78 Westy not hear these back and forth comments.

This list is for BUS CONTENT.  We had a list for a while where this type 
of exchange took place freely and was often interesting.  What ever 
happened to &quot;VW-Talk&quot;.

For those of you who dont see irony in this topic...ummm... how is it so 
many of you are offended by unPC comments, when the history of the 
Company who's vehicle you own and love, has its roots in the worst form 
of unPCness in human history?

And if usage of a term like &quot;wetback&quot; sets your panties in a bunch, how 
do you justify owning anything VW in light of the companies blemished 
role in history?

Honestly, how do any of you sleep at night knowing the vehicle you has 
its legacy in one of humanities ugliest atrocities?

Where is your righteous indignation now?

Enjoy your rides tomorrow, hypocrites.
