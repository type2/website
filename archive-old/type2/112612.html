Beg your pardon yet again.  I hope my ceaseless cries to this list are not
becoming an interminably disagreeable experience.  The good news is I have
learned every step of the way and wont have to ask too many questions
twice.

I used my torch to warm up the area all around the grease zerk in the
center of the front end.  The lever shaft area.  While I pressed the
grease guns tip as hard as I could to the zerk and my husband pumped the
grease in the only place it finally began to emerge was through the little
hole in the relay lever shafts bottom cap.  ARG!

Question: Should I pull that little cap off and dig around to see what
crud I might loosen up?  Will I need a new cap to replace the old one once
its pulled off?

Question: What in the world size thing-a-majig fits the drain and fill
doodads on the transmission?  It looks like an allen wrench the size of
Toledo.

Question:  Is there anyway to make the wingwindows not flop around?  I
looked for the screws I saw in the Bently Manuel but I cannot find them on
my bus.

Good news in that I managed to fix the sliding door so that it will lock. 
My key is from a different bus ignition, hence no way to lock the doors. 
I am going to drive to a locksmith and see if he can possibly rekey the
locks.  Its rather a bummer having to worry about stuff when the bus is
out of view.

Im going to do the process of static timing today.  The bus seems to be
pinging a bit more than ever.  Mostly up long hills, and this is not
nearly as hilly as up north will be.  Wish me luck!  (Actually, you might
want to wish the poor bus luck!)

Every time I voice a need I get several great folks with great solutions.

Jennifer
