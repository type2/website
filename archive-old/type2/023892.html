Hi,

An aircooled to watercooled conversion isn't an easy thing... I've found
that if you're going to put the radiator on the front of the Bus like mine
then you can go with a radiator the same size or only slightly larger than
the original as the long run of pipeing helps to cool the water as well and
you'll end up with about 25lts of water as well!!!

If you're going to put the radiator in the back as some of the Buses on my
site have then go for the biggest most efficient radiator you can find 3 or
4 core late model plastic or aluminium would be great with a couple of
electric fans.  Maybe even two radiators if you can fit them, one in the
airflow from the side vents (sealed in if possible) and one replacing the
rear access hatch (a pain if you ask me but easier than on the front).  If
you mount the radiators in the back expect a lot of dust to get sucked
through them.  On the front it's nowhere near as bad but they are a little
unprotected.

I've found with the radiator I have on the front of my bus cooling is not a
problem and over cooling can be.  My radiator is a triple core from a 3.8lt
V6 powered family car the engine it cools is a 4.6lt V8 and it has no
problems at all even in 40c summer days (Australia) saying that though the
ratios in the transaxle are matched for the torque curve and power of the
engine so it never has to rev high even on the freeways (110kmh_at_2000rpm)

Hope this helps and send me details as you go for the site

Cheers
Steve

P.S Finally someone else advertises my site... Ahhhhhhh, the hard work is
paying off :)

Pretty cool, huh?

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; I plan on doing a subaru engine conversion in the future. Since I have
&gt; an '81 air-cooled model, I will need to install a radiator and the
&gt; associated plumbing.
