&gt; If that doesn't help, I'll run the small jets for a
&gt;&gt;while and then pull the heads and inspect them for signs of overheating
&gt;&gt;(cracks).  Now that I've had a taste of good mileage it's hard to give up,
&gt;&gt;but I don't want to burn up my cylinder heads.  Oh, oil temps show no
&gt;&gt;noticable change before and after the jet swap.  Within acceptable range
&gt;&gt;the whole trip.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Well that's all, as usual comments, flames, etc. are welcomed.  Have a good
&gt;&gt;Friday, everyone...
&gt;&gt;
A mechanic in Canada suggested to me pulling the dual Solex's and opting for
a single Holley retrofit for more power. He said the gas mileage would be
close to the same and I should notice and substantial increase in power (eg.
no engine bucking on hard acceleration when cold).

He has been in the Volkswagen business for sometime so I assume he knows
what he is talking about. He quoted me a price of about $600 for the carb,
retrofit to the VW, installation and tune-up.

Anybody know anything about this?
