60 at 4G.  That means 75 at 5G.  I wouldn't worry providing I had
plenty of life insurance and was ready to check out.  Oh well, at
least the 71 has vacuum assisted disc brakes.

&gt;A bus engine spends most of its life around (or above)4G - why not
&gt;counterweight?  I think it makes perfect sense.
&gt;
&gt;Everyone i've talked to says &quot;...if you don't run a counterweighted 
&gt;crank,
&gt;then don't see much above 4G...&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Well, in my 71 with the 5.38 tranny, 4g is probably gonna put me at 
&gt;about 60. 
&gt;With the counterweight, i wouldn't worry so hard about seeing 5G...

&gt;&gt; a new engine.  I start from a new case that I've already ordered.  
&gt;The
&gt;&gt; engine will be stock 1584cc but I want it reliable, leak free, and 
&gt;long

&gt;
&gt;you can buy a brand new 1600 VW engine for a little over $1000 and 
&gt;get
&gt;fuel injection and hydraulic valves,  that would be my first choice 
&gt;
&gt;&gt; The firs thing I want to choice is the crankshaft.  Is a new
&gt;counterweighted
&gt;&gt; cast crank better than a used stock VW crank?  Remember, I want a 
&gt;long
&gt;&gt; lasting stock engine.  so the counterweighted crank sounds better 
&gt;to lower
&gt;&gt; internal vibration once everyting well balanced.
&gt;
&gt;at normal driving speeds a counterweighted crank really does not 
&gt;help that
&gt;much, spend the same money on balancing the stock crank and you will 
&gt;have
&gt;very smooth engine.
&gt;
&gt;counterweighted crank is usefull at 8000rpm
