Subject: Calling All Electrical Wizards

Greetings All,

70 Bus.  Stock electricals except for European taillights.  Generator and VR 
have not been touched since purchase of bus one year ago.  They seem to be 
functioning fine and the belt has the proper tension.  Idle speed is set at 
925 rpms.

So..........I've noticed that when I engage the turn signals my generator 
light pulses in time with the flasher.  The generator light is not bright.  
Very, very dull glow.  Can't even see it during the day.  Rpms seem NOT to 
affect this phenomena.  The generator light will pulse/glow at idle or revs.  
No other sort of load (headlights, brakelights, rear defroster) produces this 
effect.  I'm wondering if this might be a sign from the big VW that the VR is 
on its way out.  Any thoughts on this?  Time to clean connections?

By the way, I don't think this has anything to do with the European 
taillights (but who knows?) inasmuch as I recall having seen this before I 
installed the new taillights.

Mike
