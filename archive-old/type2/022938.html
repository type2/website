Subject: Brake Drum Puller...
Mime-Version: 1.0

I attempted to change the shoes on my bus for the first time this weekend, 
and could not get the drum off. Here's the situation:
1977 Transporter, with the drums that have two crews in the front, and two 
holes for moving the adjusting stars at around 6 o'clock, and one hole at 
around 1:30 for looking at the lining on the shoe. The bottom two holes for 
the stars were missing the rubber covers for I don't know how long. After 
much WD-40 and liquid-wrench, I was able to get the rear star to move and 
backed the shoe away from the drum as far as I could. However I could not 
get the other start to move at all, (and I have succeeded in bending that 
hole into a rather non-circular shape) and I can not get the drum off.

So I searched through the archives about this issue and came up with 
several references to hitting it with a hammer and using a brake
drum puller. I decided that a puller would probably help me get the darn 
drum off, so I called several FLAPS and got the same response from all: 
&quot;There is no such thing! You might be able to find a gear puller big 
enough, but we don't have one.&quot; What gives? Does such a device really 
exist, and if so where would I go to get one? Any other advice on how to 
get that star to move? Should I try to manufacture a puller, and if so 
where should I start?

Thanks for any help,
-Nick
