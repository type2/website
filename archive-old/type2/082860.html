Subject: Re: [T2] Will Plywood Sheets Fit in a Bus

I just measured my '71.  48-1/4 just above the corner radius at the load
floor and 48-1/2 at the belt line.

You can get a sheet in there, but it has to be aligned just _so_ to get it
in!

&gt; &gt; With the spare tire out, they will just barely fit through the rear hatch.
&gt; &gt; However, it is a very tight fit on mine and tolerances might make a
&gt; &gt; difference.  Measure twice, cut once!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I prefer to put plywood on the roof rack.
&gt;
&gt; roof rack is full of canoe....heck I usuallly need to empty out the inside
&gt; before I could put much of anything in there especially a piece of plywood

&gt; &gt; &gt; Before I drive over to Home Debit, does anyone know whether full size 4x8 sheets of plywood fit inside a completely empty (no seats at all) bay window bus?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
