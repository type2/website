Just a reminder, if you need an excuse to:

Drive your bus 400 miles, camp, visit 4 states in two days, 4 different VW
shops and enjoy the weekend with other mostly type 2 owners, you need to be
there. Total tour distance is 400 miles. Bring your CB. Erml and the AVWA
(Appalachian VW Assn) put on great events and will welcome any VW vehicle to
the group. See gas stops with VW busses taking over three different gas
stations!!  

While this is a repeat--More info with maps and times is located at:

www.avwa_dot_com/avwa/hippiedays.htm

Saturday:
Start at Newport, Tenn.--drive thru Hot Springs, NC
Fletcher, NC (German Automotive--1 hr sale, shop &amp; boneyard tour &amp;
refreshments)
Greenville, SC (Vintage Auto)--1 hr sale, shop &amp; boneyard tour, $1 plate

I will have Type 2 List hats available if you want to save $3.20 shipping. We
drove the Saturday leg of the tour last year in a 60 356 coupe and will be
enjoying the trip in comfort in the 75 Westy. 

See you there!!
