&gt; ok, what you have all been waiting for...pics of my new avp engine
&gt; for the 78 Champagne Edition.
&gt;
&gt; One of the heads is &quot;AMC&quot;, the other ?

As far as I know, there have been only 2 manufacturers of VW 2.0L heads, AMC
and Volkswagen, so I'd say &quot;AMC and Volkswagen.&quot;    You can confirm by
pulling the valve cover gasket off the &quot;no name&quot; head and looking for the VW
part number and logo.  Some have said that &quot;mixing&quot; heads in this fashion is
a no-no based on something that sounds scientific (e.g., &quot;different alloys
expand at different rates, blah, blah&quot;) but I don't buy it.  First, you'd
figure AMC, eager to sell more heads, would recommend installing their
replacement heads only in pairs, which they don't, and, second, if the AMC
head had a materially different expansion rate than VW heads they'd specify
a different torque for the head bolts, which they also don't.

As far as I know AVP has a good reputation for building sound engines so I
sure wouldn't sweat the &quot;mixed&quot; heads and wouldn't start stating
categorically that heads shouldn't be mixed unless I had a Ph.D. in material
engineering.
