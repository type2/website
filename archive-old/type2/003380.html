Here in London weather wise, this weekend was great. The first proper warm
days this year. I could wear a T-shirt &amp; not be cold, but just cool enough
to prompt continual work.

 Unfortunately I had to work on Saturday, but today I managed to get on with
the bus, got loads of jobs sorted, was inspired with solutions to others
that had eluded me all winter. I have decided to insulate the bus as per the
excellent article on www.bulley-hewlett_dot_com/VWindex/

Here in the UK I can't find 'Koolpatch', but today I found a product made my
'Marley' called 'roof-seal'. This does not have glass-fibres in it, but does
bridge small gaps &amp; is black but metallic (due to something along the lines
of glass-fibre). I got thick plastic sheet, fibre-glass insulation &amp; even a
couple of cans of spray cavity fill (like yellow shaving foam that hardens).

So, today went like silk, Worked on the bus for the morning, went to Church
in the afternoon &amp; it was still warm enough to work on till 6pm, oh well
just my day, thought you might like to hear good news, not &quot;Help&quot; mail.
