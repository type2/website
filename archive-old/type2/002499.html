Funny thing is everybody professes to want one but no one wants to drive an
underpowered vehicle with no air conditioning, no cruise control, no heat,
and no airbags. The old image v. reality quandry.

&gt; Well, we choose to drive around in an archetypal symbol of kinder analog
&gt; times. I do it because it makes me feel like that. Other people like to be
&gt; reminded too. I reckon that it indicates the removal of a nice comfort
zone
&gt; from our culture and all these people want it back. Lucky us.
&gt; Be like your van, nice. Who else can do it?

&gt; Driving my split around town gets me the slack-jawed
&gt; &gt; gapers and the
&gt; &gt; occasional compliments, last week some guy in a &quot;Trans-Am&quot; gave
&gt; &gt; me the peace
&gt; &gt; sign....&quot;oh ick&quot;. I suppose they mean well, on the other hand
&gt; &gt; maybe they're
&gt; &gt; just being smart asses.
&gt; &gt; Sometimes I enjoy the &quot;when I was a kid, I drove across the rockies in
one
&gt; &gt; of those...&quot; when I'm buying gas, and sometimes I've got other
&gt; &gt; things on my
&gt; &gt; mind; I always try to be nice and personable; I'm always hoping
&gt; &gt; for the one
&gt; &gt; time someone will come up and say &quot;You know, I've got a couple of those
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
