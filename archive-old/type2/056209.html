&gt;Hello,

&gt;My tune-up plans were thwarted this weekend by the sudden realization that
&gt;there are no discernible timing marks on the crank/fan pulley of the bus:'72
&gt;type IV engine 009 diz. The timing scale is intact and there is a nice
&gt;centerline on the fan housing but nothing visible on the pulley that looks
&gt;remotely like the  two timing marks that are alluded to in the &quot;idiot book.&quot;
&gt;I removed the plastic cap on top of the fan housing as suggested by Muir but
&gt;this only revealed a dark and dirty place where the other side of the fan
&gt;lives. Am I missing something obvious?

It's there, but it's not obvious.  The notch is in the edge of the fan -
the INSIDE edge.  That means in front (FIF) of the fan belt groove.  It
might be covered by grease or paint.  I'd recommend setting the engine to
TDC and then looking in the vicinity of the 0 degree mark for the notch.
When you find it, paint it with whiteout and you will never have the
problem again.
