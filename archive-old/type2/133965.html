Subject: air cleaner intake (?) hose

Afternoon; 

I just replaced the two pieces of hose that attach from the heat
exchangers to the blower motor in my bus (74 Westy, dual carb), that one
rectangular-end and the other circular. 

I went to connect the third piece of hose, which in my bus, apparently
runs from that thermostat/flapper valve at the right front of the engine
compartment, and snakes around to end openly near the battery, so that it
can suck in fresh cool air. However, that third piece of hose, in VW's
infinite wisdom, is a larger diameter. The PO had jerry-rigged and
duct-taped a piece of regular blower hose to try and make it work.

I checked on Bus Depot's site and couldn't find a reference to it. Is
there a specific part number for this hose, or a certain length/diameter
that will work for this application? 

Thanks, 
Dan
