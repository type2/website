&gt; Volksfest 96 is 7-8 September in Yakima, Washington.  I'm going and, even
&gt; though I'd love to take my new 59 Westy, looks like I'll be taking trusty
&gt; Rozetta, the 71 Westy instead (it's only 140 miles, but there are a few
&gt; little things that need to be fixed first before I take the 59 out of
&gt; town).  Next year.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone on the list going to/interested in this show?

ABSOLUTELY!

I live about 50 minutes away from Yakima in my Bug, about 10 minutes
away in my Z. It's a great drive, if anyone has the notion, and it's
touted to be one of the best shows in the NW. I have a schedule of
events, if anyone's interested, and the swap meet is said to be quite
large. 

Anyone who's interested in directions or good scenic drives or camping
ideas or who needs lookouts at the swapmeet can email me or the list -
I'd be happy to comply. Since I'm about 5 days old to the list, I feel I
should do something helpful, instead of just ask the same questions that
have been asked by every newcomer. :)

Let me know.
