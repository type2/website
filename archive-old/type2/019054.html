&gt; My mechanic here in New Orleans (where I live) told me to obtain an engine for

Angelique,

I happened to drive by SIR on Friday (10/22) and noticed that there is a big
&quot;For Lease/Sale&quot; sign on the front of their building.  I can't imagine picking
up their machine shop and moving just for giggles so I wonder what's up there.
Just an FYI for you.

Scott
