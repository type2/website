Subject: Thanks everyone!

Consensus of the list seems to be that the transmission should be dropped at
the same time as the engine, to get the engine out.  Since it doesn't sound
as bad as I thought it would, I will be doing so as soon as my friend loans
me his engine stand, and the temperature rises above 20 degrees...

Thanks to all who responded.  This list is highly gratifying.
