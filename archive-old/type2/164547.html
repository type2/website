Subject: waterproofing pop top canvas

All,
A couple years back, I got new canvas top for the westy.  It was the cotton
canvas type fabric, not the more expensive, less original, used on boats
type fabric.  I bought it at bus depot, and I am extremely pleased with the
product and the service.  I did the light spray on waterproof on the
outside, I can't recall what it was, camp dry or 3M or something.  Anyhow,
camping at the beach last year, got into an overnight storm, horizontal
rain, a real tent killer.  What we experienced inside the bus was rain
drops blasting into the outside of the canvas, and just passing thru the
canvas like a sieve and turning into a spray/mist on the inside of camper.
I ended up hanging plastic around the inside which stopped the spray or
mist, but then it let water get to places that caused leaks in other
places.  Now, to get to my question, what have you all done to really water
proof your pop up canvas.  I'm looking for brand names, types of
applications, sprays, brush on, seam sealers, where you got the stuff, how
happy you were with it, etc... I looked thru the archives but could not
find any really specific to what I am looking for.

Mark
