Subject: Re: [T2] Multimeter fried?

Even if it smoked, there is still some hope: if you had it one the high amp
setting (20 A) or so, the internal fuse is basically a pretty heavy gauge
wire bridge. This thing will generate smoke it it blows. Easy test: does it
do anything when you turn it on (any non-current (A)) setting? If it still
measures resistance or voltage, it's a keeper. If not, it is bound for the
trash unless it it is a high quality unit (Fluke, Heathkit and the like).

There is nothing economical a TV Repair shop could do with a fried no-name
meter. Get one of the cheap Sunpro engine testers and you have a multimeter
that also does dwell and RPM. If you need instructions for a multimeter you
probably have no use for capacity, transistor testing and the like anyway.

Smoke from inside is a Very Bad Sign.  You can't hurt a digital meter by
hooking it up backwards, but you can hurt it by setting it up for current
(&quot;A&quot; dial setting or lead sockets) and then putting it across an unlimited
current source (like your battery)
