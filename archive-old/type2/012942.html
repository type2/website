Hey there Volks,

I've been exchanging emails with a fellow RI bus owner, who is having
problems w/ the double relay in their 78 bus (2.0L, FI, 4spd).

The bus has the part # 0 332 514 104 on the relay that has failed
bentley's test procedure. From what I can tell the combi relay # s/b 
0 332 514 120. 

What's the difference (if any) between the 120 and the 104 part
numbers ??

Could this be part of the no start problem ?? (bus has good
compression, but injectors aren't injecting, even though the fuel
pump and other systems have been tested).

You can reply to mikelquackenbush_at_aol_dot_com or me, and I'll forward it
to Mike.

Thanks in advance,
