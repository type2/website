Subject: Re: [T2] Type 4 oil sender, what is best?? 

mike the guy that rebuilt my engine for me drilled a hole in the bottom of the plate at the end of the dipstick i cant think of the plate name right now but that is where my sender is located. i can take pics for you later after work if you still are interested... i am even sure he might do a plate for you and could probadly send it to you but not sure what he would charge for something like that. After doing my plate though he has done a couple more since. works great and i installed it when i changed my oil.
good luck and let me know if you need some pics i will take them for you this evening when i get home.
peace 
CR

I've found in the archives that the dipstick senders are best in &quot;upright&quot;
motors.



But what about T4 motors??

Any other suggestions on location???



Does greater resistance (like crimp connectors, extra wire) display higher
or lower temps??



Thanks
