Subject: RE: [T2] 78 bus won't start

Check all your FI wires again (and the spark plug
wires too). There's a single wire that allows the fuel
pump to run AFTER cranking. I can't recall if it
connects to the dizzy or grounds to the case. It's
easy to miss. That might give you some fuel while
cranking, but then it would die.

78 bus problem. I have installed the rebuild 2.0 and
have spark and can smell a little fuel when cranking
the engine. But she won' start. I went back to my
pictures and found a wire attached to a tin screw by
number 3 cylinder? Is this stock? if so where does it
come from? I can't locate a wire that would match up
to this location. I thought I did a great job of
labeling every wire, but I guess not? any ideas on the
wire?
thanks in advance.
