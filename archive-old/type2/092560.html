No. 1, verify gauge function on a good running motor.

No. 2, verify no compartment or tin leaks. Make sure the perimeter seal is 
sealed and the hole under the battery is blocked, even with just copious 
adhesive and a custom trimmed ply board.  Make sure there are no birds or 
bees nests blocking the cooling air intakes at the upper rear sides. Verify 
the rear hatch seal is functional. This one seems the only logical 
diagnosis that would affect all engines.

No. 3, verify what the timing curve is doing. Verify your TDC procedure as 
if somehow you are setting all engines wrong, it would account for the same 
problem will all engines.

History

&gt;I was running a stock 1600 DP, CW crank, balanced, vacuum dizzy, and 34
&gt;PICT3. Had always gotten lousy gas mileage, but the bus ran good (55psi oil
&gt;
&gt;I had a rebuilt 1776 with about 200 miles on it (sitting for 4 years) new
&gt;case,new Berg everything,new heads, and 009 with dual Kadrons and the dual
&gt;Dell's. The vacuum gauge still goes crazy at idle and this engine runs hot
&gt;(250 around the Cincinnati Outerbelt (my test drive).

Do a compression test on this one, the vacuum gauge says it has valve 
problems, too.

&gt;I decide to put in my spare
&gt;rebuilt 1600 DP with Kadrons, extractor and 009 Guess what- vacuum gauge
&gt;still goes crazy and it is running hot.

Again, do a compression test on this one, the vacuum gauge says it has 
valve problems, too.


&gt;On all three engines-vacuum readings were done with brake booster connected
&gt;and disconnected.

Of course, you plugged the booster port at the manifold for testing??????
