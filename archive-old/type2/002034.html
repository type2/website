My .02 on Bosch.


Been getting some remand Dizzy's lately from one of our suppliers, and the
condensers on them were not Bosch. After a short period of time the points
would be very pitted, and the engine would start to misfire. Replaced with
Bosch condenser, and eliminated the problem.

YMMV

&gt; Hello...
&gt; I know a lot of you strongly suggest to use strictly Bosche.  How &quot;bad&quot; is
&gt; it to use another brand coil?  I have access to pretty much everything BUT
&gt; Bosche unless I want to wait 7-10 days...is it worth giving up a weekend
in
&gt; my green beauty to wait for the proper coil?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
