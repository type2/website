&gt; My questions ins, what do I filter it with ? My thoughts initially are to

have a lady in your life that uses panty hose.  gas disolves some but not
all, I have used panty hose ,in places without runs, for many filtering
needs.  you might double filter using hose for the first pass and a coffee
filter for the second pass.

&gt; And if you are saying &quot;Just dump the gas&quot;, I'm in the UK and we are
&gt; currently paying about 8 dollars a gallon so I'll save what I can if

ouch

&gt; The filters I use a cheap plastic ones. I know there is a glass type as
&gt; well - these look like they can be dismantled and presumably cleaned. Are
&gt; these a better idea ?

that shouldn't be that big an issue in your case

good luck
