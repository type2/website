Subject: please help - distributor problems now, stuck

Well, now I am completely suck. 

Ordered a 76 distributor from BW dismantlers in northern CA, and they
had it at my door the next day. 
Well, sorta. 

I ordered part number 231-168-005, which is what they have on the
invoice. 
What I got was part number 231-168-001, which apparently is for a 73-75
1.6 motor according to the type2 bosch part library. 

Ok, so I am guessing that I can use it anyway, regardless of being
ticked off at getting the wrong one, BUT : 

They look exactly the same, EXCEPT that little notch in mine points to
the #1 spark plug, and this one has the notch in exactly the opposite
position. Am I supposed to try and fit this thing in so that notch is in
the same position as the one I had originally? I can't because the
vacuum canister will hit the tinware and it will not fit on that side. 

So the only way this 73-75 distributor will fit is with the notch in the
exact opposite position from where the one I had before was. Is this ok?
Do I put the cap on backwards to then, so the number 1 plug is by that
notch on the opposite side from where it was before, or just move the
plugwires around on the cap to the number 1 is where it was before, with
the cap and distributor in the opposite location? 

The other number on the distributor is '043 905 205 ZC 3A0' if that
means anything to anyone. It says 'Marca Reg' next to the 231-168-001 on
the second line of this thing.

Mine is just eating itself alive at this point, and I don't even want to
drive with it in, I know its going to just break or something soon and
ill be stranded. 

Ideally, I will be able to get up early enough to either make this work,
or at least have a nice long b*tch session with someone at BW parts. 

Either I have the worst luck in the world with ordering parts, or 90% of
people that sell parts screw up 90% of their orders. 

Advise please.... ? 

Ugh.
