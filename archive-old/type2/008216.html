Subject: head light frames

Somebody was looking for headlight 'frames' (the metal piece that goes 
around the light). I have two Hella ones. They are the same size and 
shape but one has a few 1 inch or so bar like things sticking out of it 
on the back side (the side that is against the bus) I don't need them. 
I'm in Seattle, WA. If you are interested in them email me. They are 
good shape.
                    Simon
