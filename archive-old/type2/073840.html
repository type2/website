&gt; My second question is about CV joints. I was thinking about
&gt; getting a inexpensive press some where to remove the
&gt; joint from the drive shaft. A big hammer isn't doing the
&gt; trick so its either this or someone at a machine shop
&gt; with a press.  So how big of a press do I need for the
&gt; CV joints and what would be good for other bus projects
&gt; also, multiple uses i'm hoping :)

&gt; My experience is that once you remove the split rings that hold the CV

&gt; Having wrecked out about five 80-83 Vanagons and driving my own
Westfalia
&gt; for seven years I can without question say that every CV joint I've
&gt; removed required persuasion to get it off the half shaft.


In my experience, both Mssrs. Wallace and Wilder are absolutely correct!
I have owned both bays and vanagons and for some reaon the bay CV's tend
to slide off with at most a gentle tap and the Vanagon CV's tend to be an
utter &lt;insert ten of your favorite curses here&gt; to remove.  There is *no*
difference in the CV's, so the difference must be in the tolerances for
the axle.  I'd love to slap a .0001 micrometer on both types of half
shafts and see what the difference is.

In answer to Stan's question, tho...  I don't own a press, both because I
don't have room in my row house and because I feel that any job that
requires a press is the sort of job that is beyond not only my current
level of competence but is beyond the level of competence I want to
acquire.  *IF* I were to think of buying a press, tho, I would say that a
ten ton would handle any job on a VW.  The real expense of a press, tho is
not the press... it's the tools you need to make the press work.  If you
are not an accomplished machinist, a good set of arbors and plates will
set you back way more than the price of the press and it still won't have
the VW-specific tools you will need :-(

For the job you are contemplating, I would take it to a machine shop and
the machinist wanted more than $10, I'd find a different shop!  Since I
have a continuing relationship with a local shop, I am not sure what it
ought to cost, but I would guess $5 or $10 and it should be a walk-in
procedure if you don't pull him from a project as you walk thru the door.

Lastly, of course, getting the new CV on is going to be every bit as much
fun as getting the old joint off and might be worth a return trip to the
machinist or bring the hub (and cage!!!  don't forget the cage, you can't
get it on with the hub on the axle!) of the new joint wiht you had have th
jobs combined.
