Subject: RE: Maple Grove - UPDATE

An update on my location at the Maple Grove show, as I just got back from
scoping out my spot there.  I am still at the very end of the isle that goes
from the entry gate to the show, just where you have to turn either left, to
the show, or right, to the flea market.  But I am the very last vendor on
the right side of the isle, rather than directly accross from the &quot;T&quot; as
last year. Just got to the end of the main isle when you walk in (which you
have no choice but to do, since all parts of the show begin there), and then
look to your right, and you'll be looking at our stand.

For those who emailed to ask, the show is tomorrow (Sunday) and the gates
open at 8.  The VW Super Jam is one of the east coast's largest events.  It
is about an hour from Philly or 1/2 an hour from Reading, Pa.  Directions
are at http://www.maplegroveraceway_dot_com/directions.html .  The weather looks
to be perfect for a show, if a bit hot - 90's and sunny all day.

See you there!

&gt; As in years past, I will volunteer my stand as a meeting spot,
&gt; since (if I get the spot I usually have) it is very centrally
&gt; located and easy to spot. When you walk in through the gate and
&gt; proceed to the end of the entry way isle, you can either turn
&gt; left to go to the used vending area or right to go to the show.
&gt; At that &quot;T&quot; junction, my stand will be smack in front of you (or
&gt; extremely close to it if for some reason the spot is taken).
&gt; Look for the beige crew cab and the yellow Bus Depot sign.  I
&gt; will have a TV running, playing video of busses, so you can look
&gt; for that too.
&gt;
&gt; I can throw out a suggested time of, say, noon, unless anyone has
&gt; a different place/time in mind.  In years past, there have been
&gt; anywhere from one to a dozen listees who showed up at the
&gt; designated meeting time/place, so you may see someone, or you may not.
