Subject: Re: [T2] fuel sender \ gauge testing

&gt;Well you have one of two things happening I suspect.
&gt;The first is that when being installed, someone bent
&gt;the wire that holds the float so it is mis-reading the
&gt;actual levels of the tank.

Here is the actual history. It worked perfect until I was heading home from 
eBus 2004 and I got gas near Erie, PA. Thats when it first started reading 
wrong, not as bad as now, but not right.

Every now and then it would start to read accurately, but now its 
consistently wrong.

If I tap the glass on the guage the needle will bounce to the right.

FWIW, the sender I assume is the original and I have never had the tank out 
and there is no access hole.

Can I assume its a bad guage?

I will do some electical testing per Richards link (that I should of 
researched first, duh...)
