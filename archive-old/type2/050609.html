Hello list, wanted to ask a question about gas heaters,I found on for sale
on line from a 72 Bus, I have a 74 any problems there? Also what is a fair
price to pay for one of these with intallation instructions and an operating
manual?
The wife says I can get the heater or buy an original tent to go with the
Westy, hmmm wha to do what to do!
