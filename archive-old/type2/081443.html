Subject: Bus for sale

Hi again.

I don't have any pictures of the 79 Bus I'm selling, but for anyone
interested I can give you a very descriptive description of any part you ask
about.

Also, anyone who happens to be in the greater Atlanta area is welcome to
stop by and have a look.

Thanks.

Mike
