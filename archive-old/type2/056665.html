Subject: RE:  temp flaps, 72 westy

&gt;i know they are to aid in warming up the engine but as i live in 
&gt;sunny south florida the engine is usually close to running temp 
&gt;first thing in the morning in the shade (it gets hot down here). i 
&gt;don't think i need any of it but thought id ask before removing.

I'm sure you're about to be swamped with &quot;DON'T DO-IT's&quot;, but I'll add
mine in too.  DON'T DO IT!  

The flaps perform TWO functions.  1.)  They are closed when the engine
is cold so the engine warms up more quickly.  2.)  The left side one,
when in the full open (hot engine) position splits the air from the fan
and routes some of it across the oil cooler and the rest across the left
side cylinders.  

If you remove the flaps, the cooling air will not blow across the oil
cooler properly and you'll run hotter.  Period.

So if you don't want to use your thermostat, fine.  Make sure the flaps
are in the full open (hot engine) position and the spring is holding
them that way and leave them there.  You can tell if they're full open
because the 'arm' that the thermostat wire attaches to will be in the
'up' position (as opposed to pointing towards the from of the bus).  But
DON'T REMOVE them!!!
