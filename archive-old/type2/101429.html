Subject: Just bought a cheap Syncro

I have been an air cooled Vanagon Westfalia owner (Pokey) for 
about three years now and really enjoyed the versatility of 
having my own mobile cottage. Pokey has seen my girlfriend 
and I through at least five moves, lapped Watkins Glen, moved 
enough building material to renovate my basement, served as a 
storage locker, bunkhouse, and grocery getter. In short I 
love it.

My one lament has always been that I didnbt get a syncro. 
This has been compounded by the fact that Pokey has NEVER 
been winter driven and I live in Southern Ontario which is 
famous for itbs salty winter roads. Not wanting to be the one 
who was responsible for Pokey rusting away I still have never 
taken her out in the snow.

I canbt afford the sometimes $20,000 US prices for a mint 
syncro, nor is it realistic for me to have a summer only 
vehicle. My solution was to buy a not so clean syncro. Last 
night I closed the deal on a 1986 Syncro GL Westfalia. Not in 
perfect condition, so I can reconcile driving it in the snow, 
and the warts it has I can live with.

The Good:
- Itbs a syncro
- Purchased from the original owner, all bills since day one
- Paid $7,000 Canadian / $4,500 US
- Immaculate interior
- 110,000 km / 68,000 miles
- Recent (last 18 months) head repair and transmission work, 
exceeding the purchase price I paid
- Both tables, all curtains, all screens
- Rust proofed since day one, some winter driving but not a 
lot. No rot
- Tan interior, brown exterior (different shades but the same 
combination as Pokey)
- No bucking on tight turns
- New tires (havenbt checked the load rating but I will swap 
my 215/65-15 Aglis 51bs on 15b SA Rheins on there anyway)
- I have a vanity plate that says bVanagonb that I have been 
itching to put on a vehicle

The Bad:
- Really bad brakes (good excuse to put in my big brake kit)
- Bumpers pretty dinged up (good excuse to put on my Volks 
CafC) bumpers)
- Stock Faucet dead (good excuse to put on my eurovan faucet)
- No locking differential (maybe one day)
- Rear AC not working
- Webasto Heater not working
- Propane tank rusty
- Fridge not working
- Some seam rust
- Missing one hubcap
- Radio antenna broken off
- Some clouding on sliding side windows (has anyone seen this 
before)
- Its an 86 so I can pretty much forget my jalousie side 
window project
- Tons of snow and ice on the top prevented a complete canvas 
inspection
- Probably will have to leave the type2 list

The Ugly
- Collision with deer hitting passenger corner on nose, 
sliding door, and rearmost side panel. Drivable but not 
pretty. The dark chocolate brown color makes the damage less 
visible however

Perhaps the worst thing is that I probably will have to sell 
Pokey in the spring. I also have a bunch of air-cooled parts 
(rear AC, stainless exhaust system, and much more I am not 
thinking of right now) that I will have to sell off. Look for 
another post when I am ready to do some selling. Any thoughts 
on what a clean air cooled Vanagon goes for? 

Thanks,
Chris
