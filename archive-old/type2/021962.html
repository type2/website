Because of the my suggestion that I wanted to see if people think it is OK
to get CD-ROM or ZIP copies of the archives...

Ken Hooper, one of the Type2 admins,  has told me to take down my archives
of the Type2 list.

I don't fully understand his reasons, but I understand what he is asking.
So I will be taking down the archives.

I'm glad all my hard work was a waste of time.  Including my discussions
with Ken.
