if I recall from the last time I had mine off it is the same size as the
one for the CV boot bolts.  I found a set of Metric 12 point socket
wrenches at my FLAPS (Pep Boys I think) for about $20 had the right size.
these are about 2 inch long shafts with the correct end on one side and a
hex head to fit a socket wrench on the other end.  they have worked well
for a number of years.

don't forget you have to set the end play the same as on a flywheel on the
flex plate too
