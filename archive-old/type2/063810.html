Subject: Ga emissions followup

Actually talked to a nice fellow from the EPA today.Indeed the new deal will
cover cars back to 75 and will include a dyno test under load and a visual
inspection for the cat converter. None of the other equipment will be checked
for other than the gas cap. Also the standards will be somewhat more relaxed
than the original since some degradation is assumed. In general, should you
fail, you would have to expend up to $450 before qualifying for a waiver that
allows you to tag the car anyway.

 You may also qualify for a waiver if you can demonstrate that original
equipment is out of production etc. In his opinion in the case of the
Vanagon, I wouldn't have to replace the crossover pipe but it would be
reasonable to expect me to custom up a converter in whatever exhaust system I
now utilize. I can live with that arrangement.

Incidentally I asked him about Ca and Az since Ga varies so much from their
schemes. Again,in his opinion, Ca was pushing too hard on the original
equipment standard rather than test results. He seemed to be surprised as I
that a western state that I would have imagined to be very individualistic
would put up with such intrusion. According to him, in all three cases the
actual programs are hammered out the state level and therefore reflective to
some degree of voter preference. Kind of makes you wonder who the proponents
really are in these debates.
