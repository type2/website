Subject: &quot;Heat, rust, noise in VW's&quot;

Dear list,
I was wondering what you all thought of the
Bulley-Hewlett method of insulating and improving heat
in the bus. To see what I'm talking about, go to
type2_dot_com/ Library/ Heat/ heat rust noise, etc.... I
already ordered some NASA insulation and the exhaust
wrapping, but this stuff gets really expensive and I'm
not ordering anymore than a minimal amount. What do
you all think of the chance of moisture getting
trapped in the NASA insulation and causing rust in the
engine compartment? Does anyone have any experience
with this stuff? What parts of the exhaust system
should I wrap with the exhaust insulation wrap? Any
info is appreciated.
                                 Thanks,
                                 Paul Deatherage
