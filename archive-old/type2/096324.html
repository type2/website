&gt; Its time to replace all of my vacuum hoses but I am having trouble finding
&gt; metric sizes (I live in Rancho Cucamonga Calif).  Anyone know ware I can
&gt; find the correct sizes, what they are and how much I will need? 

I get hoses at a hydraulic service center, where heavy duty construction
equipment hoses are made on the spot to get these guys back in service.

I'm in Baltimore and get all mine from Langsdale Holtszman(sp)
