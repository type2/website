Subject: RE: [T2] Garage for rent?

I have a buddy in Sprinfield OR that races on mud tracks on an amateur
circuit.  The class he races requires that you build a frame or buy one,..
he builds his.  Found himself needing garage space like so many of us do.
Somehow he found two other guys that are auto/motorcycle enthusiasts that
were in a similar situation.  They leased a very large commercial use garage
and split the rent three ways.  This way they could afford it.  Downside?
Lock up your tools my man!  If it were me I would make sure that I had
enough scratch around so that if one of the co-enthusiasts bailed on you,
you could cover that portion until a suitable replacement could be found.
