Yes. Be aware that manifold vacuum is NOT the correct signal for your
distributor! Ported vacuum and manifold vacuum are very different, and not
interchangable.

&gt; Clark,
&gt;
&gt; The throttle body or intake manifold vacuum port creates vacuum for the
&gt; retard or distributor side of the canister and yes is surely enough to do
&gt; the trick. The ventury or carb neck port creates the advance vacuum or
&gt; outside canister port vacuum. i.e. when your foot is on the gas the carb
is
&gt; sucking gas from the jet like made. When you let off the engine is still
&gt; trying to pull fuel but you because your foot is not on the gas the carb
is
&gt; shut down hence much vacuum in the intake manifold. This is also another
&gt; good reason for the brake booster vacuum to be ported here.

&gt; I'm not sure but unless there's something I'm missing, it's not the carb

&gt;
&gt; I do not own a vacuum gauge.  I have somehow squeaked by without making
that
&gt; investment.
&gt;
&gt; So, the question stands:  does the progressive throttle body vacuum port
&gt; *allow the engine* to pull enough vacuum pressure to actuate the diaphragm
&gt; in
&gt; a stock (74-75 bus) dual vac distributor?
&gt;
&gt; TIA,
