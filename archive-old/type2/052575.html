That's not a torks head, it's a triple-square or XZN bit. 6mm I believe.
Some are even plain hex but most are the 3 X 4 squares = 12 point. Need the
spezial tool which should be found at most well equiped FLAPS.

Clean the heads well or you will put excess wear on the tool and the
fastener. You DO NOT want to strip them, cause then you will need some
spezial tech to get them loose.
