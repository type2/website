 Just wondering if there is any
hard evidence out there showing the value of wearing a
seatbelt in a '78 T2. It seems logical to me that if
your already, as Muir put it, strapped like an Aztec
sacrifice to the front of the bus, that you would have
no where to go in the event of a collision. I may be
wrong. 
Thanks for any thoughts,
Giles


Giles,
  I'm sure you'll hear a few like mine, BUCKLE UP MAN.  In high school a kid a year ahead of me was killed when a semi clipped the front end of his bug.  Door popped open and under the wheels he went.  He didn't have a chance.  They drove the bug away.  Just a crumpled fender.
    We all know these things are tin cans, but you need to stay inside the can.  Buckle up man.  Do whatever it takes, get new belts, get new seats, get a new bus.  Sell the damn thing and get a Caddie.
