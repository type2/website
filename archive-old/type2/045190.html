Subject: Re: [T2] Bending brake lines yerself

bending brake lines basically just takes a lot of
patience.   i ran all new lines in my J**P when i
rebuilt it.   if youre cautious and pay attention to
what youre doing, it works out pretty well.   as a
side note, they might have some type of tool/kit to
help.   i know i have a plumbing kit for when i have
to bend copper piping to help prevent it from kinking.
  its basically just a coiled spring that slides
inside the pipe.   anyone have any easier way other
than taking your time and messin up once in a while?

&gt; Anyone successfully bent his/her own brake line. 
&gt; All the brake lines you
&gt; buy come straight.
&gt; 
&gt; Do machine shops do this, or FLAPS?
