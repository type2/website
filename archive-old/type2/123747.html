Subject: RE: [T2] Heat Exchanger Removal?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hot jet coating headers *is* supposed to reduce radiated heat from
the headers quite a bit.  From 750 to 300 degrees.



Ahh, right on. I'll do that then. Get 'em super cleaned up and coated,
and do the blower upgrades and pipe insulating. Thanks for all the
inputs guys. 

Oh, and if anyones following my conversion of a 'parts bus' to a daily
driver, I've ordered shift bushings and a stop plate to get my sloppy
shifting tightend up. Also a speed shifter thingie. That'll be a
learning experience. :)  As well as a fresh engine rubber/seal. I'll
have to live with the so-so engine hatch seal for a little while yet.
Also on order are new Clutch and Accelerator cables. Figure I'll just
store those till I have lots of project time or one breaks. :) Also have
my Tail Lights coming. Bus Depots got a GREAT deal on those! As well as
the drivers side mirror. Ordered ALL that stuff from Bus Depot. Oi, and
on top of all that, a List member is shipping me up a gas pedal assembly
for a good price as well! Now all that I know of that I still NEED to
make it legal is the side marker lights and ::gasp/Dread:: insurance.

Cheers
Chris
