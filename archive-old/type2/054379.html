Subject: Re: Need Advice on My 77 Westy

Woah! They aren't very good mechanics if they can't give you the basic 
diagnosis -  especially if they claim to be VW or foreign car mechanic.

Go find yourself a copy of John Muir's &quot;How to Keep your VW Alive for the 
Compleat idiot book&quot;.

It is a very good book and can help you chase the troubles. You'll have to 
study it of course.

Can you get this bus to a place where you can patiently work on it?

Sounds simple and something electrical. Don't let them try to find a 
mechanical problem because they are just trying to sucker you.

Write us back and we can help you find this problem.

Carb or fuel injected???

&gt;Hello all,
&gt;
&gt;I've been pretty much a lurker so far because, well, I haven't actually
&gt;driven my Westy yet. Here's the scoop. It ran fine when I looked at it. Then
&gt;I bought it, had it towed home (not because it couldn't be driven but because
&gt;I was in NJ and it was in Philly and the city was about to tow it in their
&gt;effort to clean up for the Republican Convention later this month... forgive
&gt;me I digress!). So it was towed here. I have a knack for buying VWs that run
&gt;when I look at them and then stop running as soon as they arrive here!
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, I replaced the ignition switch (which was bad when I bought it), and
&gt;then it wouldn't start. Turned over fine, just never caught. Then I went on
&gt;vacation to the UK. When I came back there were stickers on it that it would
&gt;be towed in 24 hours if not removed from the parking lot (condo). Not being
&gt;able to start it, and new to all this, what did I do? I had it towed to the
&gt;only local aircooled shop I knew of.
&gt;
&gt;They say the engine won't turn all the way and that I'm probably looking at a
&gt;rebuild job. They seem like nice people, though I have no experience with
&gt;them, but I'm hesitant to go the rebuild route because of the $$$--they
&gt;haven't given me a price yet. They said they would pull the engine and try
&gt;and determine the source of the problem and then give me a better idea of
&gt;what I'm looking at. I'm going to talk to them tomorrow.
&gt;
&gt;So, what should I ask? Is it reasonable that the bus ran fine, was towed
&gt;here, I replaced the ignition switch, it wouldn't start, was towed there, and
&gt;now needs a new engine?? I guess stranger things have happened when it comes
&gt;to VWs :~)
&gt;
&gt;Any advice appreciated. I really don't know what to do from here. I've
&gt;started doing some work on my 65 Bug, but no engine work per se (well, I did
&gt;pull the carb and replace it). Mostly brakes, fuel lines, etc.)
&gt;
&gt;Thanks all...and hello to the other women on the list especially, it's nice
&gt;to know we're out there too.
