Subject: Need help with welding Woes

I was hoping somebody might be able to answer some welding questions.

I spent the better part of this past weekend putting in a right rear lower 
corner.
The welder I am using is a Lincoln 135-Plus 120 volt with gas bottle 
attached.

I've included a couple of URL's to some pictures of my result.
1st 2 are of my weld thru holes.
3rd one is where the gap is too large.
It came out far from great but not too bad for my first attempt.
I practiced for about and hour or so but since I wasent getting any better
I figure I would just dive in.
Welding so far to me definetly seems like an art form to be mastered.

1st issue I have is with a couple of burn thru holes.
How do I fill them with the welder?
My thought was to put a tiny little patch behind it and weld that in.
But I figure somebody out there has the correct way to fix it.

2nd issue is even though I measured and remeasured everything I came up 
about 1/8 inch short on one side.
So I tried to put the welder setting a little lower so as not to burn 
through and join the sides.
Unfortunatly it seems the gap is just too big and all I am getting is 
splatter joins which arent working out too well.
So how do I fill in the gap without making it bigger by burning through the 
metal?

The setting I am using on the welder are D-3.
If I go higher on the amps I just burn through.
Lower and all I get are splatter puddles.

I've got the gas coming out at 25 as I am working outside.

Any help would be greatly appreciated on these issues.

My last questions are about what do I put over and behind the welds?
What I mean is I grinded the welds down fairly flush but as you look along 
the weld the body
is not perfect so I'm going to have to smooth it out with something and I'm 
not sure if filler is what I should use
or if there is something else.
And finally on the inside should I seal it with anything along the weld 
line?

Thanks Much
Kevin
