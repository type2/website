Subject: stuck driveshaft

Engine removal Day 375 or so:

   Things are going well, but we are making like a tortoise.  Thanks to
Karl for the great engine tin, Todd &amp; Maui Haui for hang time and tool
loaning.

So far there have been no issues that we have been unable to overcome.  I
did want to ask the lists advice on a particular issue.  

We are removing the drive shafts to r&amp;r the cv joints.  All the books
say to just remove the 6 bolts and the CV joint will just fall away.
This happened on 3 out of 4 joints.  However, the drivers side, inside
joint appears to be stuck.  All the bolts are removed, I can rotate
the driveshaft with the tranny in neutral, but it won't come off.  It
feels just like the bolts are in place.  Any ideas?

Also, where can I get kerosene?  It seems to have gone out of fashion.
Maybe I should use something else as a solvent?  Gasoline makes me nervous.
