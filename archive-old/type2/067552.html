I wish I'd seen the show. It could be a number of vehicles, including a 
Subaru. Subaru made a mini van and PU that looked much like the VW... 
but much smaller. 2 people bump elbows when riding in the front 
seat. Dihautsu and others make similar small vans.

&gt; Also in interesting news:  I think it a fair statement that the Corvair was
&gt; an attempt by GM to emulate the bug, right?  Anyway, they didn't stop at
&gt; the bug.  Did you know there is an air-cooled, small van/bus thing called a
&gt; Corvair something or other?  A very bizarre vehicle indeed.

VW's popularity launched a number of small, fuel efficient vehicles from 
Detroit. The Corvair was a &quot;direct answer&quot;, but the Ford Econoline and 
Falcon were another approach (which lead to the Mustang). Detroit never 
got it right. Give the people a simple car, and stick with it. 

VW also forgot this premise.
