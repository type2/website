Hello all,
            There are a couple flea markets near where I live and today
when passing one, I noticed a bench sitting outside one of the storage
buildings there.  I am not sure how long it has been sitting there but I
went and checked it out and....wow it's a middle bench from a bus!  So I
asked the guy there how much he wants for it and he said $20.  Not too
bad considering there is only a tear on the right side that could be
fixed without too much hassle.  There is a picture of it at
www.wicals_dot_com/bus/pics/bench.htm.  I have been wanting one for some
time but my good buddy Jason (fasterlaster) gave me his a while back so
I am not in need of one.  If needed, I can pick the bench up and hold it
for you for a short period of time.  
            For those of you who answered my cry for either a bus or an
engine for no more than $1000, your offers were much appreciated.  I
opted to spend the money restoring my current engine.  It has about 500
miles on it and its running strong.  125psi all the way around.  Much
thanks to Mark Dearing and his crew up at Salem Imports in Salem, VA.
Because Salem, VA (and Marks hospitality) was so great, I think we will
actually be moving up there instead of to Boise, ID.  Although this
decision was also made because we do not have the money to make it there
after fixing the bus.  I look forward to moving my family up there and
seeing new territory.   Happy trails everyone.
