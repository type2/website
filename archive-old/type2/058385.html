&gt; Good Morning (well, it is here in South Australia)
&gt; 
&gt; I have had my Type 2 '82 2L FI aircooled campervan for nearly a year
now,
&gt; and have already done some short trips around the coast, just a few
hundred
&gt; miles each time.  She is showing her age (about120,000 miles), but
runs
&gt; pretty well.  So far, have replaced rear wheel bearings, CV joints
and a
&gt; gearbox main bearing.
&gt; 
&gt; The bus reminds me more than a little of the '62 split window bus I
owned
&gt; in the 60's - it still feels like a vcehicle designed by a mechanical
&gt; engineer rather than a marketing computer.
&gt; 
&gt; Here is my question:  in Australia we will find it hard or very
expensive
&gt; to use unleaded fuel after the year 2000.  The mechanic I use here
tells me
&gt; the engine is not really designed for unleaded, although he could
import
&gt; different valves, an upper cylinder lubricant injector and a catalytic
&gt; convertor...  Heck! ...

Relax your mind.  Here in the Youess we were forced to go to leaded
fuel several years ago and our VWs didn't stop.  VW put unleaded
valves and seats in all engines starting sometime in the late '60s or
early '70s.  Since just about every engine has been rebuilt since
then, it's pretty hard to find an engine that doesn't have hardened
valve seats.  You'll be ready to go when the switchover occurs.

Not so good is the &quot;oxygenated&quot; (alcohol-added) gas that has been
forced upon folks in SoCal in the past few years.  I can't tell any
difference in drivability (some claim to be able to) but I can tell
you that the gas hardens fuel lines about twice as fast as the old
gas.  You have to keep a close eye on the rubber parts with the
oxygenated fuels.

Frankly, the new smog regulations anger me.  The war against smog has
been won.  The number of &quot;smog alert&quot; days in the LA basin has dropped
to almost nil, and will continue to drop as older cars leave the
fleet.  Despite this, the Smog Czars continue to tighten the
restrictions and find new bogeymen to fight.  Latest on the chopping
block are weed-whackers and jet-skis.  Talk about grasping at straws! 
I guess that the smog folks figured out that if they declared victory
they would be out of a job.

Don't let this happen in your country!
