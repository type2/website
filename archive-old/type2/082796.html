Subject: Re: Tire Report

Stan, thanks for you thoughts.   I agree that the
minimum load rating mut be met.  I also agree
with regards to the higher pressure being
preferable, but only time will tell if these
tires separate like your passenger tires did.  
If they do, I'll be the first to tell.   

Again, these tires have a higher load rating than
tires with the antiquated &quot;C&quot; rating system used
on LT tires, so I'm fairly comfortable with them
so far.  They also have a higher load rating than
the Michelin MX reinforced that everyone loved. 
If they don't work out, I go to the LT27x8.5 that
I really wanted and not feel like I was throwing
money away.    

I've seen Agilis, the new Yoko's, and the
Bridgestone RD's and I'm not interested in that
tires.  Just don't want highway rib tire. 
Correct me if I'm wrong but Agilis doesn't even
have a M+S rating, right.  Summer only tires for
that price? 

Nokian has some all seasons that are interesting,
but there isn't a Nokian dealer within hundreds
of miles. 

I'll let you guys know how they wear and handle.
