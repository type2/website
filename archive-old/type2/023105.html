Subject: Some Western Sates help needed (long)
Mime-Version: 1.0

Mary Beth and my great bus tour,
2001, A Bus Odyssey,
has already hit a monolith ......... family !

And,
I am so very sorry to come to the list with this request, but there is a 
lot of wisdom in here to tap, and a lot of Seattle, Vancouver, Western 
states bodies that may be able to assist this household with our 
aggravating new problem.

Mary Beth and I have a really full plate this year as far as travelling and 
being away from home.
We have worked hard and allocated our resources methodically for over 15 
years so as to quit working at an early age and be able to travel over the 
next 4-5 years, then decide where we want to live for the balance of our 
years. We are hoping that travelling might reveal our new home to us, 
perhaps as we gaze upon it from the window of our bus.

With that plan always in place, we have made sure that we would always be 
available at a moment's notice to get back to see our parents and meet 
family obligations of resource, should the need arise. Also, we have made 
sure to schedule Thanksgiving and Christmas as a time made available for 
our being able to &quot;get back to the folks&quot;.

Everyone in the family tree has known of our plans, but we still 
find..............

Last month, at a kitchen table conference, with our being absent, it was 
decided that the whole family should get together for a vacation get 
together on the outer banks of North Carolina .... when ? ....... this 
Summer ......... about the time that Mary Beth and I imagine we will be 
driving Casper in Alaska.

I'll skip a lot of further family closet cleaning at this point, 
but............
Let's say Mary Beth and I could come up with an alternate vacation sight.
Somewhere in the West. A bit closer to where we will already be at the time.

Ok, given that, I get vague real fast as to where, when, and the specifics 
on what we could find to rent so that our whole family of 12 would have a 
place to call home for a week.

Anyone out West done a family get together like this before?
Oregon coastline, Washington coastline, Vancouver, National Park, State 
Park, ???
Close access to major airport in and out is important, as another equation 
problem.
If so, specifically where, with as much detail as possible please.

P-Mail me direct, or even send me your telephone number(s), and I will call 
you for further advice and info.

Thanks for reading.
I'm so very sorry to trouble you.
Mary Beth and I are just trying to do what we have planned for so long,
what most people never get around to doing,
and now we must solve this new problem of being guilted into having to meet 
a new obligation.

Please tell me that somebody out there knows of, or knows someone who does 
know, of  this really neat spot, with ready access to an airport, with 
available cabins and lots of varied interest activities to please all the 
many age ranges of the family.
