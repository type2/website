I concur.  Very useful.

&gt;I know for example mine reads 6% high, did it both ways and the error is
&gt;consistant.  so at 50 on the speedo I'm only doing 47....pretty close .
&gt;
&gt;also remember if you change tires your speedo will read differently.
&gt;bigger tires = slower reading,  smaller tires = faster reading.  mine was
&gt;probably reading slower than actual speeds until I put the big 205R70X14
&gt;tires on her.

I think you have the last statement backwards.  With your previous, smaller
tires the speedo would have been reading even faster than it is now, not
slower.  I found that with extremely large 14&quot; tires on my bus (27x8.5 BFG
All-Terrain TA) it *still* reads about 2% fast.
