&gt; 1) The piece of tin that goes right in behind (FIF) the cooling fan.  It's 
&gt; the closest piece to you, and right in the center if you are looking in the 
&gt; engine compartment from the rear deck lid.


think I might have one in the garage, it would be from a two liter but I
am pretty sure they are the same

&gt; If your in MD we can save some shipping.  UGLY but useable and cheap is just 

I'm in Baltimore

&gt; fine by me, I am looking for function not form here for my people mover (for 
&gt; now).  I also don't have the foam seal that goes between engine and body.  

NO!

&gt; Can I live without it?  Can I just cut up an old matress or something?

in an emergency you can use foam pipe insulation, get it at any hardware
type store (Lowe's Home Depot etc)
