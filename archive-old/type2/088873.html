&gt; Actually the wasserboxer has less in common with the type 4 engine than
with
&gt; the original Beetle (type 1) engine, with which which it shares a
multitude
&gt; of parts.  Not that the wasserboxer is exactly the same as either, but it
&gt; has more in common with the type 1 engine  than the type 4 engine.

OK, I stand corrected, I have only ever seen a Wasserboxer, never worked on
one, I was misinformed by someone else. Thanks for setting me straight. :)
