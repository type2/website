Tom--
Thanks for the info. Unfortunately, if this thing requires a Westy tank, I 
have to bow out. Such a beast would be well-neigh impossible to locate where 
I live (took me three weeks to find a windshield for a loaf, which tells you 
how many VW friendly junkyards there are in my neck of the woods), and I 
have no idea how to hook it up. If others can come up with a solution, I'm 
listening.
 ----------

OK, here are some figures for all who asked:

Heat 5200 BTU
Fuel Consumption .25lbs/hr continous (Vanagon Westie tanks are approx 10lb)
Power 1.5amps_at_12 volts continous
(These continous figures mean that is the consumption rate when it is so 
cold
the thing is working full time. If the thermostat is cycling on and off,
your consumption will be lower)
Heated air volume: 45cfm
Dimensions: 360mmx160mmx100mm
Safety features:
Continuous flame monitoring
Thermal cut out for overheating
Prepurge clean out residual propane for starting
Postpurge cleans out un-combusted propane
Auto low voltage shut off at 10.8 volts
Fan only option (does not appear to have variable speed fan control-I'm
sure some lister can figure out and upgrade)
Low noise, quiet fan

Let me know ASAP!

Thanks,

Tom F.
