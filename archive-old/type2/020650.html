If you're interested, have a few brand new bus accessories.

Shifter extensions, straight or bent
Accessory lighter, no need to drill holes, ivory, grey or black knob
Valet, mounts on air channel above windscreen
Horn button clock, black button, clock face white, silver ring, battery

All these items are extremely simple installs and can be moved from bus
to bus should you decide to get another.

If interested please reply to:

Thanks in advance, have one of each on my bus and don't know how I got
along without them before.
