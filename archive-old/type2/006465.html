Eggshells are hard and tough.  They often do damage to the paint in the form
of cuts, chips, and deep abrasions.

Check the area very carefully and deal with any breaks in the paint ASAP to
prevent rust and paint loss.

&gt; BILL

Popular wisdom is to soak the egg stains with detergent solution, then
with ammonia solution, and then to soak any remaining stains with
detergent that contains enzymes.

Good luck!
