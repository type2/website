Subject: bent shift rod?

     Hi all, I've got a 70 bus I picked up last fall, on the ride home it 
began jumping out of 4th gear.  So pulled tranny and I was told some teeth 
were missing on synchronizer so they replaced it and I'm on the road again.  
It continued to jump out of 4th gear after rebuild.  I hassled they guy who 
rebuilt it and he gave me a different transmission and that one is popping 
out of 4th.  So today I decided to pull shift rod and inspect, it is bent at 
distal end near coupling.  It's not bent much just a tiny bit and it looks 
like someone may have done some welding to that end.  Does anyone agree with 
me that this could be the source of my problems and if so what years have the 
same rear shift rod so I can head to the yard and get one?  Any comments, 
suggestions greatly appreciated.  Marcus
