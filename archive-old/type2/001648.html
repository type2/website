...

Anyone have any info for me on this?


&gt; Ok, I have searched the archives and cannot find the info I need.  The PO
&gt; stripped oil drain plug hole on my '77 bus.  The plug is ok, but it just
&gt; spins and never really tightens.  I have not been able to find out what
the
&gt; threading of the bolt/hole is.  Can anyone tell me what the thread is.
The
&gt; local FLAPS has some self tapping oil drain bolts that I mat want to try.

Thanks again,
