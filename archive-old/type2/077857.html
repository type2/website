Subject: Cops &amp; Buses

Y'know, it's really sad to hear that some police in
the U.S. have nothing better to do with their time
than harrass people without due suspicion.
Here in Australia, the State Police had a Royal
Commission(what equates to a Senate Enquiry) into
Police corruption and illegal practices.
Now it's got to the stage where they're so careful of
what they're doing that if anything people get away
with a bit more than they should.
In fact rather than having police that hang around all
the time and hassle people, if your house gets robbed
then you're lucky if you can get them to move their
butts and come and do something about it.
I know one thing for sure though.......even in the far
outback the Cops are VERY unlikely to pull you up if
you're in a bus.
The general opinion here is that no-one in their right
mind would try anything illegal in a bus, with the
possible exception of serial killing!
And I'm not kidding.....the most infamous serial
killer in Australia at the moment used a VW baywindow
panel to pick up his victims and dispose of them.
But don't worry......he's behind bars and has stopped
giving us a bad name:-)
