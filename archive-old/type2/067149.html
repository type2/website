Subject: Clutch adjustment on a '74

Is there away to adjust the clutch linkage or cable?  My clutch is
engaging pretty low, only about an inch or so off the floor.  Plus, there
is about two inches of free play at the top of the pedal.  It seems like
there should be a way to &quot;shorten&quot; the cable by way of adjusting it, to
take up the slack and move the engagement spot up a bit.  Is there?  It's
been raining non-stop for days, so I haven't really looked under the bus,
but the next clear day after today I'm going to check it out.

I put a new clutch in just over a year ago, so that's not the problem, I'm
pretty sure I just need to compensate for wear.
