I discovered something a few years ago that I'd like to share with 
everyone.  I went to my local VW shop to get some new nuts to replace
the rusty old ones (during a rebuild) that hold the heat exchangers
 to the heads.  Some of them were so rusty that the studs came out
 instead of the nut coming off.  The guy sold me some copper nuts that
are normally used on the waterboxers, I think.  They are a 12mm wrench
size so there is more room to work.  They are copper so they don't rust 
and become one with the stud.  And they are slightly oval so they hold
tight and don't come loose, a problem I was having.  I've since used these 
little beauties to hold the muffler on and to attach my dual Delloroto 
manifolds.  On my 72 Campmobile, these are all places were the 13mm 
wrench or socket just didn't fit so well.  I hope this helps some
of you.
     

Among my circle of friends and acquaintances everyone considered
 me the VW guru.  Then I discovered the list.  I became humbled
 and now realize that I am a mere Grasshopper, a very young Luke
 Skywalker, a guru in training.  The List is my training ground.
  Thank you List.
