Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Depot prices to HIGH ! I Found parts way

&lt;&lt; Like ALL products sold by me, everything is TEST FIT and time tried

before ever sold to the general public.  It has taken me over 5 years to get

the split bus parts down pat and have been testing bat window parts for a

couple years, 100's maybe 1000's of dollars of bay parts given away to be

tested by drivers in all different climates.

As an owner of three orphaned and semi-orphaned British cars
(fool me once, fool me twice...fool me three times) I can relate
to the shoddy parts syndrome (some are even worse than ori-
ginal Lucas), at high, high prices and only one source being used
by many vendors...
