Subject: RE: [T2] moody fuel injection

My father in law is a rather successful gun-smith here in Oregon.  He does
great work, and all of the law enforcement folks take their equipment to him
to keep their various items in good working order.  My point is that the
ultrasonic tank that he uses in smithing is an old ultrasonic jewelry
cleaner &quot;box&quot; as you stated.

It works incredibly well on a great many things.  Materials removed
typically are caked and coated in many varieties of lubricants that have
been baked on from negligent owners.  He also uses it to get into acidic
piting caused by folks using low grade powder.  It works fantastically well
and was quite cheap for him to acquire used.  I do believe that he uses a
particular citrus solution for cleaning the various metal parts and such.  I
would not expect metal fuel lines to be any different, but certainly I could
be wrong.  I would think that the capability of the tank to ultrasonically
cleanse the interior of the lines would depend on if the fluid medium could
pass through the entirety of the interior of that line.  Bottom line, no
solution, no effective ultrasonic clean.  I will ask him what solution he
uses in his tank if anyone wants to know.

There's my two cents worth at any rate  :-)
