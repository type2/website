Carbon buildup in one or more cylinders can do it.  If you've got a
cylinder that mounts near the base of the carburetor and has a wire
going to it, then you've got a malfunctioning electromagnetic fuel
cut-off valve.

Do you do short in-town trips mostly, or lots of highway driving?  If
the former, then try doing a high-rpm drive for half an hour or so.
That's a moderately good way of blowing the carbon out of the
cylinders.

Playing with the timing will only affect the buildup of carbon, not
what happens after you've got it.  Since the key is off when the
problem happens, timing of the spark (which requires electricity) is
irrelevant....
