Subject: Re: [T2] Helicoil Life?

hello Guys  First this doesn't sound like a heli-coil but sounds more like a 
KD  insert.  A heli coil looks like a spring, a KD insert looks like a insert 
that is treaded on the inside and outside.  The KD inserts will come out with 
the plug just about everytime and you will have to replace them each time.  A 
heli -coil shouldn't come out with the plug unless you cross thread it. 
Timeserts are nice in that they work like a KD insert but have locks on them to keep 
them in place.   later and have fun  Mark Dearing
