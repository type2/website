&gt;Nearly all, of the gas
&gt;gets burned, so where is the extra energy (heat) going?

Probably more than 80% goes right out the tailpipe.

&gt;As far as the alternator, it was a bad example.  Feel your transmission
&gt;after a long drive.  Very hot.  No combustion either.

I'll feel my transmission after a long drive, but I won't feel my cylinders or
heads!
