&gt;Shouldn't there a dowel on both sides of the #2 bearing? (For a total

i was told that you only pegged both sides in an arctic clime, where 
you might actually spin one at startup w/ cold oil.  ciurse, i can't 
remember whether i got that from one of my 50-s era books, hoover or 
?????
so take w/ grain of salt.
