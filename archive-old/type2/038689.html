Subject: Full Rebuild Succesfully Completed

12 hrs Friday
12 hrs Saturday
At last my bus is running again! I built my 1600 single port from the ground
up with a  rebuilt crank, new performance  cam + gear, all new bearings,
used but worthy rods, new rings , new exaust valves, new oil pump,new
clutch, new engine mounts, used doghouse oil cooler + associated tin etc..

She fired up right away around 1am sunday morning. Sunday we drove up the
sea to sky highway and went camping near squamish(near Whistler). Drove back
this morning and  she ran like a charm the whole way, tonnes o' horses
clopmin around back there. For once I wasn't holding up traffic.

I am very happy to be finished, it was a lot of work but worth it. Total
price tag $1200 can. I could have bought a rebuilt long block for $1250 but
this was way more fun. I didn't expect it to cost so much but then I had to
replace the crank and rods and upgrade the oil cooler.....you can see how it
adds up.

I was a COMPLEAT idiot but I did it!!
