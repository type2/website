Subject: RE: [T2] Aftermarkey wheels for a Bay

&gt; VW engineers know all this and they designed the tire sizes and gear ratios to produce an optimum balance between reliability, performance and efficiency.  Don't think you can second guess them and increase one without decreasing the others.

Exactly but they also had to design for a wide range of conditions
Those of us who have limited climate and grade variations can tweak to
accomadate.
