Subject: Re: [T2] Wiring Question

on my 68 there are 2 3 terminal brake switches.
i think this changed early in the middle of 68 production
they went from the multipin flasher box and the 2 pin switches to the 3
pin switches and a flasher relay.

i would use a 69 diagram. the earliest one you can find without the big
flasher box.
