Mine sounds like a diesel as well!!!!! sometimes. I once heard a VW with an
Audi 1.6 turbodiesel, it sounded exactly the same.......but seriously, that
type of noise sounds like a problem with the exhaust system - either the
silencer or the heat exchangers. Does it backfire as well on deceleration?
If so, then you've got a leaky system. If not, its probably baffles or
something internal, assuming all is stock and present.

The reason your noise is apparent at these conditions is probably because
that's when its under load. And it also occurs at very low speeds, like 600
rpm or so. Have you ever heard a VW Camper with no exhaust (or, for that
matter, any car with no exhaust, ie. drag racers) rev up? The noisiest bit
is when you slam the throttle down, not necessarily at max rpm.

Even though its just a text message, that noise doesn't sound like a mechanical
fault.

To my dismay, it was covering up another noise - here are the specs -

- 1979 2.0, hyd. lifters, FI
- only upon acceleration, or revving up the engine
- never when deaccelerating
- i went through and unplugged every spark-plug - doesn't matter by cylinder
- it sounds like a freaking diesel engine - coulda coulda coulda coulda
(really fast and deep)
- makes the noise up hills, or acceleration - if driving a constant speed on
the flat, no noise!
- can also hear the noise when you turn the engine off, right before it stops
rotating

If you need more specs, let me know!

Thanks in advance
