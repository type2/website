&gt; In the VW
&gt; manuals they appear connected with one hose from the cooling fan
&gt; (pressurised air), one to the air cleaner, after the filter (slight vacuum
&gt; from carb/inlet), and one to the tank breather lines, which previously went
&gt; directly to the air cleaner.
&gt; Am I reading this correctly??

Yes, the air is blown from the fan through the canister to the air cleaner.
Air is also sucked from the breather lines by this air flow.

&gt; If not, is it dangerous to have my breather connected the way they are as
&gt; Doyt mentioned??

It's either blowing air into the tank or sucking it out.  Hooking up a
vacuum gauge will eliminate the guessing.

&gt; As I have no pressurised air tapping in my fan housing (type 4 motor) it
&gt; will be difficult to install a canister, unless someone has a better idea
&gt; them me. Any thought's???

That's weird.  It should be on the left side of the engine sticking out behind the flap that is assembled inside the fan shroud.  It's part of the top left engine tin.
