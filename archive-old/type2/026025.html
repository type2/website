Subject: Re: [T2] Burning a quart of oil a day...

SLoWxDiVer_at_aol_dot_com sends:

&gt; My bus burns a quart of oil every day.  I don't really want to rebuild the
&gt; engine but I know I need to.  Everyone tells me that rebuilding an engine is
&gt; really hard, and a lot of work.  Would it be more reasonable to put a new
&gt; engine in, that is newer and more powerful engine in or rebuild mine?

Rebuilding a VW engine isn't really hard. It's not simple, but neither is it
really hard. 

BTW, what engine do you have in your Bus now?
