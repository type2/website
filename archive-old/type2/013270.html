Steve Reeves (&quot;dubdriver&quot; &lt;reeves32_at_home_dot_com&gt;) recently advertised on this
mailing list  &quot;[T2] Parting out 77 bus&quot; 

I responded with a list of parts i needed and he quickly responded with a
the parts of those that he had.  After i waited over the weekend to see
what i could purchase at a local swap meet and finding nothing i emailed
Steve Reeves back and agreed ed on a price including shipping of
$73. (seemed to good to be true, should have known) I offered to pay him
via paypal, he responded with that works best and i transfered $73 into
his paypal account &quot;Reeves32_at_home_dot_com&quot; the same day.

That was almost the last i heard from Steven Reeves. 

After 4 emails over the next 15 days to him about weather or not they had
been sent as promised i got no response. Odd because before the money was
transfered he responded to the email often within the hour. 

On May 3rd i decided to try contacting him in other ways. I sent him a
postal mail demanding an explication which i got no response. I also
found his work phone number via a web site that was in one of his emails
http://instantsigns_dot_com/.

I called and talked to him and he stated that one box of small parts had
been sent successfully and the rear hatch he was sending me had been
returned because of bad packing. That was on May 3rd. No boxes have arrived
and i have not hurd from Mr Reeves since. 

I have continued to email Mr Reeves at his many email addresses and have
continued to get on responses.

I have recorded all of the emails, snail mails and the phone call
between myself and Mr Reeves on my web page to save space, at 
http://zoser.mammoth_dot_org/parts/
to save repeating them hear.

My point for this email is two fold. 

DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM ANYONE NAMED
Steve Reeves, and be careful of anyone using an email with &quot;reeves&quot; or
&quot;sing&quot; in there email address. I hope there is no one legitimate
sellers out there with the name Reeves that will be hurt buy this, but
better to be safe then sorry. 

And also, What can i do to get my money or my parts back. I filled a
complaint with paypay but I'm sure they are swamped with complaints and get
the feeling they don't have time to go though all of them.

thank you all

eli
