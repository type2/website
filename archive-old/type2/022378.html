&gt;Years ago, some stations had a &quot;dial a grade&quot; system where you could set a
&gt;knob on the pump to the grade you wanted.  since there were six or more

&gt;the intermediate values.  Perhaps this station is doing the same, which
&gt;would explain why the midgrade pump is hooked to the regular tank.

I am pretty sure that all filling stations mix their fuel for other than regular and premium octanes.

A couple of years ago, at the Citgo near my house, I was pumping 89 octane, and it was painfully slow.  About .05 gallons per second.  I went inside and asked the attendant about it and he said that they were out of 87 octane, and as a result I was getting straight 93 for the price of 87 (at one-third the flow rate).  I decided not to gripe about it, and filled my tank.  :-)

This leads to another question.  Does high-octane gas make your engine run any cooler than low octane (assuming no detonation or preignition is occuring with either)?  A friend recently told me that he sees significantly lower oil temps with 93 octane than with 87 in his air-cooled Westy.  On the one hand, this seems to contradict the conservation of energy (mileage and power don't change, so where is the extra heat going?) but on the other hand, what I've heard about higher octane fuel burning slower makes me think it might just be possible.  I haven't had a chance to test this out yet - what do the physicists here think?
