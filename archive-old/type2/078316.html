Subject: Re: [T2] how heavy is a waterboxer motor ?

Howdy,

I just got my 2.0L T4 engine back from the rebuilder, and the truck freight 
company charged me for a 369-pound item.  That was with my crate as well, 
but I'd imagine you'd crate your wasserboxer.  Again, my engine is an 
aircooled, but that should give you a ballpark figure.

Good luck!
