Subject: Buses Of the Corn Update

Hi Volks,

Everything for BOTC is coming up fine so far. There's plenty to do and 
lots of great volks are attending from all over the Northeast. We'll be 
chowing down on Breakfast Burritos, fresh Corn on the cob; enjoying 
some unique bus-oriented events and generally having a great time. It's 
a great deal for only $10!! (CDN).

We're off in the bus on a family vacation until Wednesday next week, so 
I'll be signing off the lists until then. If you have any BOTC 
correspondence I will probably be a bit slow getting back to you. If 
it's urgent, leave a message on my voicemail at (416) 724-8808.

More information is available on the website, please visit

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
Toronto, Ontario, Canada
