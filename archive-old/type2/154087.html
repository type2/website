    So George, I think I qualify as a &quot;shadetree mechanic, and I'm about the
right age, do I get the cookie? :-)

    I'll bet your right, back in the &quot;good old days&quot; when a guy had to fix
things, instead of changing parts, I would imagine you had to use your head,
and what was at hand. Where is MacGyver when you need him?
    Anyway I did see it in an old Mechanics Illustrated, so at least it was
an official fix for GM once, according to M I anyway.

Still wouldn't use it in one of my engines.

Howard
