Barrry,

I don't know about type III, but EC is the engine code for 1.8 Porsche 914
engines from the mid 70s.  The engine is almost identical to the VW engine,
but with a different drain plug and oil filler/dipstick set up.

Of course, over the years, the engine could have been rebuilt with hydraulic
lifters.  You should be able to see them if you take the rockers off.

Good Luck,
