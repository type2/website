Subject: Re: Speaker Placement

My experience:

On my last bus, a 78 house-paint-white Rustfalia, we took a piece of 2' by 
1' plywood, cut 5&quot; by 7&quot; holes in it (side by side), screwed our 3way 5X7 
speakers to the front, and covered the front with sound transparent black 
carpet sourced from a stereo store.  We then took that little useless 
flip-down door on the front of the bench seat cabinet (under the seats) and 
put it in the garage rafters.  We then secured the wood to the front of the 
bench cabinet with one screw in the top centre so that the speaker magnets 
poked into the door opening (but did not take up any space in the storage 
space).  We then took the whole works off, cut a notch into the board for 
the lift-up-the-seat latch and put it all together again. :) Stereo imaging 
and volume were excelent unless we were carrying our laundry back there.  
This would probably work with 6X9s as well.

On my current bus, a 77 deluxe westy that I have yet to drive after three 
years of restoration and slacking, I have chosen to use old, quaint looking 
Radioshack speaker boxes from a home system with expensive 6X9s in them.  
These can be placed anywhere back there and will have enough cord to be 
placed outside the bus should the party warrant it.  I will secure them when 
driving so they don't become projectiles during exciting driving situations.
