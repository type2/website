Subject: Camper Quest Q's

As I said earlier, we've decided to get another camper. We're a family of 4
(me, wife, 2
daughters ages 7 and 9).  The camper won't be a daily driver, but just used
for camping
trips within 300 or so miles of our home in Cincinnati, Ohio. Here are the
features we're
looking for:

1) Dependable first and foremost. I've already had my share of restoring, and
will be paying
for most maintenance, so the availability of work and parts is important.
2) Sleeping - we'd like the top bunk to sleep both our daughters.
3) Front swivel seats - so we have room for all 4 of us to hang out if it
rains.
4) Fridge and stove - really last in the list and not absolutely necessary.

So, from a bit of research, it seems a 78-79 Westy is our best choice. Any
older models
have the above?

I've looked thru thesamba_dot_com (thanks for the tip!) and eBay. What do you
folks think I
should expect to pay for something in good, usable and mechanical sound
condition?

Thanks for the advice!

Tony
