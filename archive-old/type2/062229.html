Subject: Re: VW canvas

I called an outfit in Grass Valley called, appropriately enough
'Anything in Canvas'  Here's the scoop.  They work in canvas only, 
awnings, boat covers, TRUCK covers, but they don't do stuff that is 
considered upholstery.  Upholstery includes the Pop-top treated 
canvas stuff.  They never work from patterns, they work from the 
existing frame for truck covers.  No connections to me, their phone 
number is 916-273-9266.  I didn't discuss prices as I have no VW 
truck to be covered.  They are VERY busy.
