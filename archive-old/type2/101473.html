Subject: Re: [T2] Suggestion for plugs?

Well here is my opinion of Platinum plugs... It is based on second hand 
knowledge so investigate this yourself (Internet) if you really care. 
Furthermore if anyone knows anymore about it than what I have posted - 
educated me!!! &lt;grin&gt;

I was told that Platinum plugs may not be as effective as standard plugs in 
a point type ignition system because they have lower internal resistances 
and the coil depends on all of the system's built in resistances to build 
it's charge and thus the strength of it's charge. This may really be 
splitting hairs but I prefer the Bosch standard plugs. They are cheap and 
effective and run those in both of my Type IV powered VW's (Beetle and 
bus). I ran the Platinums in my Beetle overseas and I think that it did not 
run as smoothly as it did with the standard Bosch Super plugs at less than 
$1 each. It certainly did not run $2 better (the difference in price). Also 
because the plugs are advertised as being more durable, I still did not see 
that much more mileage before I changed them (with the fuel we used - 
leaded in the mid-90's - I seemed to change my plugs annually to clean and 
gap them).

Based on the info above it would seem if my info is correct that the 
platinum plugs are better suited for electronic ignitions.

FWIW.

I would recommend replacing the points with the condensor, dist cap with 
rotor. Those pieces seem to operate as matched pairs. I keep the old parts 
for spares.
