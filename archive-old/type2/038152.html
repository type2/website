Subject: Westy sink (early 70's)
Content-Disposition: inline

I recently purchased a VW van that the PO had install the Westy interior, poor job I might add.  The sink has two holes that I would like someone to tell me what they are for.  (The guy never hooked the sink up).  Please don't tell me they are for the drain and faucet.  I have already identified those.  I'm guessing one is to fill the water jug, which I don't have, (can someone give me the specs on it) and the other is..........

Thanks,

Kevin
