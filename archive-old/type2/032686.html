Subject: Re:  15 in. wheels

Hi,
 
&gt; Anybody have any experience with converting to 15 inch wheels on a
breadloaf?

 I'm part-way through doing so. Finding it something of a PITA.
 
&gt; An on-
&gt; line wheel source indicated Mercedes Benz wheel code et37 6.5 x 15 h2
, but 
&gt; didn't
&gt; reveal what model(s) or years.

 I havn't been able to pin this down, either. It doesn't seem to be
easy to
find this information for some reason. I would have thought that it was
tabulated by some MB enthusiasts somewhere, but if so I've yet to come
across it.
 
&gt;  Any other wheels (available from the local recycler, 

 Some, but none that seem to be a bolt-up. Some big Audis (200) use the
same bolt pattern but apparently need the centre reaming.

&gt; please), with the correct offset and bolt pattern. Some machining can
be
&gt; done en-larging the center hole). I'm not looking for custom alloys,
just
&gt; a set of stock wheels to utilize 15 inch tires.

 There do seem to be some 15&quot; Merc wheels that do bolt up: certainly the
ones I have have the correct pcd and a correctable offset, however the
mounting surface (land?) is much thicker than the VW wheels, so I am
currently sourcing longer hub studs to enable me to fit them.
 I have also had to get the mounting holes drilled out to clear the
14mm studs, as Mercedes were using 12mm bolts for these wheels.

 There are some earlier Merc wheels that were 14&quot; and were purported
to be a direct fitment. I think that there may be others available in
a 15&quot; size that have a thinner mounting face, allowing use of the 
stock studs. I don't know which cars they would have been fitted to,
though, and I don't think anyone else on the list does either, since
this question has been asked repeatedly but an answer has never
emerged.
 Someone (Karl von Salzen, I think) posted a list of offsets and models
for many Mercedes (it's in the archives, let me/us know if you can't 
find it) but that doesn't address the bolt-hole/land thickness issue.

&gt; Thanks in advance.

 Sorry I can't be more help.

Cheers,
	W.
