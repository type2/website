Subject: Re: [T2] Converting a 78 to a 74 type exhuast system

From: Ted Kitch

&gt; I've just purchased a complete 74 type exhaust system to use on my 78 2L FI
 engine.  I've been reading lately about the alternator bracket and that it
 is NLA.  Does anyone have a spare that I could purchase or can someone tell
 me how to make one?  Also, I was told when I purchased the parts that I was
 buying everything that I needed and I would like to confirm this.  I
 purchased both heater boxes and the exhaust along with the gaskets.  Is
 there anything else that I need?  I want to make sure that I have all of my
 ducks in a row before I remove the engine from the bus.  Also, does anyone
 have any insight that they could give me when attempting such a change?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Just buying heater boxes and the exhaust after the boxes means your ducks are still down south for the
winter:)

You will need a few more parts to do this changeover:
- the alt bracket from a 72-74 and 79 Cal engine [you knew this already]
- the left and right heater pipes between the boxes and blower fan
- the 72-74 and 79 stove pipes between the boxes and the flapper valves
[75-78 are oval on the bottom, 72-74 are round]
- the left and right lower FRONT tin, the left one can come from a 72-74 but the right one needs to come from
a 79 Fed engine unless you want to patch over the square hole in the 72-74 right tin. The 72-74 has a duct
mounted on it for hot air to the carbs.
- the left and right lower pushrod tin from a 72-74

I may have all the parts you need except the 79 Fed right front tin.

I know I have 2 of the 72-74 alt brackets, there are in front of me right now.....
If the other person that needs one pmails me, it will be cheap.....my driveway has too much stuff!
