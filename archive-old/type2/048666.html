Subject: [T2] check this out(friday)

hey volks,
happy friday. for a little bus content, lizzy
should be back on the road soon.  as you may remember
it had a nasty rod knock and when taken apart revealed
it chewed my crank up...great!  but i have a new crank
and it should be reassembled in the next two weeks and
then i have the lovely task of putting the engine back
in.  no big deal...except for the fact that it has
been steadily in the 20's here!   oh well. anyways i
received this picture from the omaha vw club email
list and thought id pass it along.   it is a vw, but
not a bus, but you must check it out, talk about vw
abuse!
