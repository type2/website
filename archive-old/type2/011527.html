--- No Quarter &lt;silent_at_beatricene_dot_com&gt; pondered:
&gt; What the heck?  This was an old message which Paul
&gt; later decided was not a
&gt; good idea.  How's come it's sending it out again?
&gt; 
&gt; NQ

I have no idea!  I didn't send this out again, but my
apologies to the list...

The idea is off for now, the bus that I was looking at
was not ready to make the trip.  Maybe next summer
I'll just fly out with the family and buy one and
drive it back.  

Paul
