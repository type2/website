Subject: '71 Disc calipers
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hello,

 I'm looking for a source for good brake calipers. The front left caliper
sticks down on my bus, and I'm thinking I'll either have to rebuild it or
buy a new one. I've read of the possibility that it could be caused by
clogged brake hoses, but I have yet to check that out.

 Can anyone offer advice on rebuilding/replacing stuck calipers? And where
a good place is to find new ones?

 Thanks!

 Ian
