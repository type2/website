&gt;I was reading the instructions that came with my new rings, and it says

&gt;I just ordered a craftsman honing tool to break the glaze on the
&gt;cylinders.  Will this be sufficient to drop that ridge down?

You use a ridge reamer. DONT try the honing tool. Check piston fit below
the ridge (slide in the piston and slip a feeler gauge in beside it.)
You'll probably find that there's too much clearance, and that you need new
jugs.
