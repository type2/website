In light of the association of heavy rain with the failure of both the 
emergency flasher and the turn signal function, I'd suspect that the relay 
which operates both functions has gotten damp, because it is located on the 
nose panel (on the back side of the fuse box) and is upside down so that 
water leakage could get into it. However, it is also possible that the 
emergency flasher switch itself has coincidentally become inoperative 
(because it is much less exposed to the elements) in not passing along 
voltage to power the relay (when the switch is &quot;off&quot; it powers the relay to 
run the turn signals, when &quot;on&quot; it powers the relay to operate the emergency 
flashers). I would opt to buy a new relay, or try drying it out first to see 
if that effects a repair. The relay in question is the larger of the two on 
the back side of the fuse box.
You can test the emergency flasher switch by removing it and then checking 
to see that there is continuity between 30 and +, and between 49a and both R 
and L, all with the switch turned &quot;on&quot;. Do this test after removing fuses 8 
and 12; similarly, remove the fuses while replacing the flasher relay if you 
choose that route.
