Subject: Engine switchout

I have a 1970 1600 single port going into a 1971 bus.  I changed the clutch 
pressure plate on the engine to the 71 style (no ring).  I also replaced the 
throw out bearing.  However the engine still does not want to slide on the 
last inch or so.  Is there something I missed?  Any suggestions would be 
appreciated.  Please reply directly to my email as I am on the digest.  
Thanks.
Chris
