&gt; The muffler you have is a bug muffler and is preferred by many. It is
&gt; cheaper and I think has better qualities than the single pipe version.

OTOH, VW used a different muffler on the bus for a reason.

Bugs don't have hatches into the passenger compartment to allow exhaust
fumes to be pulled into the passenger compartment.  Buses do.

I've used both and can tell no diffrence in performance.  I have a good
hatch seal, so I could detect no gases in the bus, but that really depends
upon your bus and how you drive.
