Subject: off-idle problem when cold (fuel-injected)

The FI troubleshooting page does not seem to contain an answer for this
particular problem. The cold engine will start without fuss and idle
smoothly, but when I tap the accelerator it almost stalls before picking up
speed. Once warm, this problem goes away.

The aux. bypass valve seems to be fine in the sense that it is open when
cold (I did not check whether it closes when warm, but idle speed does not
increase once the engine is warm). EGR is permanently shut off, so that
couldn't be a source of problems. Couldn't find any vacuum leaks either
(which doesn't mean there aren't any). Distributor advance mechanism is not
binding. Engine seems to have a tendency to overheat and I suspect lean
running, but have yet to test fuel pressure and bench-test the injectors.

Any ideas? :)

Thanks,

Sami
