Steve has a set of expensive quality tools and has used them over the entire
bus. That said, he thinks the BugPack tool is neat.

&gt; I really want to avoid blood, bad language, big hammers, jacks,
&gt; penetrating oil, broken tools  and the acetylene torch
&gt; this time if I can.

Then get the BugPack tool. It will pop out 5 seconds after you tighten the
screw and you won't have to fight gravity and alignment.
