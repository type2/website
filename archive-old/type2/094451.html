&gt; The problem isn't the shroud, it's the finning on the heads and barrels.
&gt; The doghouse fan already moves lots of air past the cylinders, but the
&gt; fins can only transfer so much heat to the air.  I doubt that the 911
&gt; shroud will move that much more air past the cylinders, and the air isn't
&gt; as well directed inside the open plenum.

I think on Jake Ray's site he says the 911 fan can move air at
3000 cu.ft./min. In other words it can move enough air to cool a 400HP 3.6L
Turbo 911.  He states that the real trick is to match all the parts to your
engine so you aren't over or under-cooling the engine.

One of the possibilities he mentions is using Aluminum finned cylinders to
make real use of the 911 fan and radiate the heat better.  Whoops, my wallet
just exploded.  I think the 911 look is pretty cool but it's an &quot;in for a
penny, in for a pound&quot; kind of upgrade.

Just repeating what I read...visit the site.
