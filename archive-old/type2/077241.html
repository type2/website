Subject: Re: [T2] Platinum Plugs

Steven and all;
   FWIW, I installed four Bosch platinum plugs in to my daughter's '77 Baja, with
a rebuilt by us 1600 DP in the summer of '98. They're still firing as she blasts
about the deserts and mountains of New Mexico in search of a college degree...at
6,000+ altitude. (Dunno if this is a factor).

   The following May (1999) I installed a set of the same in my butt-ugly,
freshly resurrected from the grave, '69 Bug (with a 1500 SP). Still lighting off
at the first turn of the key.

   They work for me.

'78 Westy that's really buggin' my butt to get finished
'69 Bug, all over the place, every day.
And a bunch of other VW projects...(are those voices I hear audible to
others?...hmmmmm)
And cats, fat cats, roaming the place in search of prey.....

&gt; &gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A friend of mine has a '71 Westy with a rebuilt 1641, and has a question
&gt; &gt; about platinum plugs.  Please reply to him at: whoajesus_at_hotmail_dot_com
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Does anyone have any experience with &quot;platinum&quot; spark plugs in the 1600
&gt; &gt; engine? Muir says don't use them (but doesn't say why); but Bob Hoover
&gt; &gt; recommends them -- mostly because they last longer between plug changes and
&gt; &gt; fewer plug changes means less stress on the head over its lifetime.
&gt;
&gt; Jason,
&gt;
&gt; Years ago, shortly after Bosch started making these, I bought a set for a
&gt; 1600 DP T1 engine.  I had a very bad experience, fouling, running hot,
&gt; missing etc. etc.  I was told by a mechanic I trusted that they were &quot;a
&gt; bad thing&quot; in the T1 engine, so I ditched them and have never looked back.
&gt; As I (vaguely) remember, his take was that the thin electrode in them
&gt; fouled too easily and that the heat range was wrong for the T1 engine.
&gt;
&gt; The caveats to this story are:
&gt; (a) it was *not* a new engine;
&gt; (b) it was a long time ago, so the plug design may have changed.
