&gt; So my question to you all is this, what do you think could be leaking 
&gt; in there that would cause oil to get sprayed around the fan and out 
&gt; the flaps ? Checking the oil I don't seem to have lost a tone of oil 
&gt; but there is certainly a fair bit in there and its getting sprayed all 
&gt; over.
&gt; Thoughts ? Tips ? What would your first check be ?

Do you see drips on the oil filter?  Could be the oil cooler.  Another 
possibility might be rear (RIR) main seal.
