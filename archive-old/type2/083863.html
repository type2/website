Bob,
Forward Air is the place to ship anything--cheap and fast---

If it's under 200 Lbs. it's a $45.00 flat fee--period, anywhere in the
continental US----

Later,

Terry

seat/chair 
A list member in Texas wants to buy the middle seat from my 71
transporter. He want's to put it into his 66 bus. I checked with UPS and
their guideline limit is 150 lbs with 130+ACI- for the overall package.
This seat would weigh close to 100 lbs. +ACo-packaged+ACo- but would be
about 170+ACI- overall. 
Can anyone recommend a shipper to use from So Cal to the Houston, Texas
area?
