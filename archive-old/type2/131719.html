Subject: '77 Manual Tranny into '73 Bus

I also forgot to ask what would be the benfiet of swapping the two trannys. 
In this case it would be to replace a known bad with a known good. But what 
I would like to know is if one geared better than the other, would there be 
any expected improvements in performance, etc.


Thanks,
