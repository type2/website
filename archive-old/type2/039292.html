Subject: RE: capacity

the manual for my 69 westy says that is holds 15.9 gallons of gas... which
ive found to be correct...

12-16 mpg sounds bad.. im running a stock 1600cc sp in my westy and i get
around 18 mpg in the city and 23-24 on the highway (driving at 55-60
mph).. i usually dont drive faster than 60 since the bus doesnt seem to
like that very much...

btw, has anyone tried that fuel tank sealer from POR-15... i have seen a
few good testimonies on the newsgroups, i just want to hear if anyone here
has had the same good results...
