Subject: Re: 914 engine

&gt; Hello,

I have a lead on a 2 ltr. high performance Porsche 914 engine. With dual 44
webers, and 009 dist.The questions that I have are;
 1. How do you identify the engine as a 914 Porsche?
 2. If this is a high output (big compression) what sort of timing needs to
take place
     to handle today's cheap gas.

 3. Can your replace the heads or have them shaved( to reduce the compression)
while they  are in the BUS?

Price on the engine is $2300 what do you think of the price?

I have a 2 Ltr in the bus now and like the extra power.
Thanks for you help

George
