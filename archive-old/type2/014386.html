Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] Cheap timing light/tach-dwell meter and other tools?

George Lyle:
We were racing AA fuel funny cars,after racing inboard hydroplanes, AA
Fuel Roadsters Etc. Etc. we had our own machine shop, Balancing shop and
Etc Etc. and we always bought the best because we didn't have a choice
every timing light was good, every torque wrench was good ...... no
matter the brand and it was 1960-1970 and everything was American made
and it was all very good. 
Sorry to say most of the quality manufacturers are &quot;gone broke&quot; and you
guys gotta live with lesser quality even if it has the old quality brand
name.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Good old Sunpro!
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Timing lights are real cheap since VW folks are the only 
&gt; market for them.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you know a pawn shop that has a Snap On timing light for $20, 
&gt; please
&gt; &gt; &gt; let me know the phone #!!!!  I will call right now to buy it!  A 
&gt; quick
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; perfectly adequate.  I have one and have been using it for a 
&gt; year or two.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The pickup is held together with duct tape, as I keep busting it 
&gt; up, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; it tapes rather well and keeps on flashing.  When the bulb goes, 
&gt; I will
&gt; &gt; &gt; toss it and buy another.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have an old timing light, don't even remember the name but I got 
&gt; it for
&gt; &gt; one of my first VW's I know it has to be at least 25 years old.  
&gt; those
&gt; &gt; things just keep on working.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They do seem to be long-lasting, if you take care of them.  Both my
&gt; tach/dwell meter and timing light are from Heathkit, which means 
&gt; that I
&gt; put them together myself.  That was many moons ago, and Heathkit is 
&gt; no
&gt; more.  The neat thing is that the Heathkit manuals also include 
&gt; detailed
&gt; troubleshooting instructions that allow me to fix the gadgets if 
&gt; they
&gt; ever need it.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a feeling that Muir got the idea for the idiot book from 
&gt; Heathkit
&gt; manuals.  The procedure style is certainly the same!
