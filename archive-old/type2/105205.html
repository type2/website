Subject: Rear torsion bar adjustment (can I get my rear down?)

Hi volks,

When I bought my 75 westy a year ago, it came with the rear end elevated 2-3 inches higher than the front. This doesn't sound like much, but when sleeping with my head toward the front, it is enough to make me feel like I am lying downhill. It also gives my bus this sorta funky hot rod look that I don't really like. It handles very well and I cannot find any modifications to the rear end so my questions are:

Can the torsion bar be adjusted (or mis-adjusted) to the point of causing this drastic difference?

If so, shouldn't my bus be handling really bad?

I have zero experience in this area, so any experience will be welcome and appreciated.

Thanks,
