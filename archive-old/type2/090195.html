Subject: Re: [T2] wife and I trip -- luggage rack

&gt; Does anyone have any good ideas about what the best way to 
&gt;utilize the luggage rack on top of my 74 westy??? 

Put anything up there that 1.) you don't mind getting wet or wind-blown, 2.) 
isn't overly-inviting to theft, and 3.) you don't have to access very often.  
It's a pain putting multiple things up there.  I once loaded mine up with 
firewood for a campout.  Took forever to load it and way to long to unload it 
and I was afraid the whole drive up that the logs would come loose and go 
bouncing along the highway.

Just remember, whatever you put up there makes your bus taller.  A Westy with 
nothing on top will pass through most parking garages and drive-throughs.  Add  
more than a few inches and you may not fit anymore!
