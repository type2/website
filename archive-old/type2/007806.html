Subject: engine cleaning
Date: Fri, 20 Nov 1998 23:00:06 PST

If you are trying to clean an engine of all its grime, PLEASE take it 
out and take it to a car wash. The car wash should have a engine 
degreaser option. Spray that on, then wait a bit. Put a few more 
quarters in and hit it with the high pressure soap, which is heated. The 
pressure and the hot water should clean it up. Then rinse.
Why do it this way?
The car wash has to recycle their water. The oil will be removed and 
disposed of. Much better then dumping oily water down the drain, or 
filling up rags that end up in a landfill. Besides, it will do a damn 
good job of cleaning off most of the gook.
