Thanks Mike!

&lt;&lt;I just looked at a spare 79 steering gear in the garage. Mine has a
red plastic plug on an upper flat immediately to the passenger side,
right side, of the connection to the steering column. Shown as a
circular spot on the upper portion of the steering box on page 23,
chapter 2 &quot;Front axle&quot; in the Bentley manual.&gt;&gt;

     I found it, and found a easier way to get to it, then from under
the bus. Just remove the cover around the steering column on the inside
the bus on the floor.
Easy as pie!
Thanks eveyone!
