Subject: Re: broken exhaust bolts

Oh man! I was wrestling with a stubborn exhaust bolt just today!

My two cents: Douse away, use vise grips, slow and easy, tap tap tap, 
all the tricks. But if it breaks off flush, don't even try an easy out. I 
have never successfully used an easy out on an exhaust bolt and I have 
snapped off easy outs trying on two occasions. A machinist can drill out 
a snapped off bolt and rethread the hole for you, but they cannot 
generally do anything with the hardened steel of a snapped off easy out 
in the middle of a snapped off bolt. 

Not that I need to advise you to do this ('cause you'll be doing it on 
your own without prompting), but cussing a lot while working on it is a 
good way of managing the stress of the situation.

Good luck,
