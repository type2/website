Subject: RE: [T2] Side view mirrors

&gt; I have a set of these &quot;Hagus&quot; mirrors, and I can testify that 
&gt; the metal doesn't rust and the glass quality is excellent.  
&gt; Unfortunately, the translucent plastic around the glass does 
&gt; deteriorate in the sun over the years.  I finally had to 
&gt; disassemble the mirror when the glass got loose and reinstall 
&gt; the glass using other means to secure it.
&gt; 
&gt; Ron, if you have any influence over the manufacturer of these 
&gt; mirrors, ask them to switch to a UV-resistant plastic.  These 
&gt; mirrors are sooooo close to being perfect, but they really 
&gt; dropped the ball with the plastic!


Unfortunately I have absolutely no influence over Hagus. In fact I feel
lucky when I can get their Bus mirrors at all.  More often than not they
don't have any Bus mirrors to ship, so when they do I stock up on a zillion
of them because I never know if/when I'll ever see them again!  I haven't
had other complaints about the plastic beads deteriorating, so I perhaps it
is a climate issue as Greg suggests. On the bright side, since you say it
has happened &quot;over the years,&quot; this is good news, as it means the mirrors
actually lasted years! :-)  Many of the aftermarket ones I've seen have
lifespans that can be measured in months, not years. They rust out as
quickly as the aftermarket chrome hubcaps do.  You'd probably never see the
plastic bead wear out because the frame would have rotted away long before
that.
