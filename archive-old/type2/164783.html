Subject: Re: FI harness

Hey Tim, I just found this guy through Boston Bob at the Transporterfest in Boston last weekend.? Bob had one there and I can say that it sure looked top notch quality.? I would guess they are expensive, but probably worth it if you are commited to your stock FI and are having problems or fire damage etc....

No affiliation, just passing along the info.
