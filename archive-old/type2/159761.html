I'm not sure what year bus you have, but I have a '78 and it's supposed 
to do that.  There is a spring-loaded catch on both hinges.  So, let's 
say you have it set up as a bed, if you lift the seat portion, the 
catches will click and now all you have to do is pull the seat towards 
the front of the bus and the backrest will rise up and fold into the 
seat position.

Now, usually to unclick it (when it's in the bed position), you just 
keep pushing the seat porting towards the back of the bus and it will 
click again and then you can pull the seat back down (towards the front 
of the bus) to the normal bed position.  You might want to check out 
your catches because they can get bent and/or have broken springs.
