Volks,

Tirerack(888-3718473) has reinforced Michelin MX 185R14 tires for $65
each plus shipping.  That's what I'm buying when the present Michelins
are used up.  A guy named Gary (extension 386) gave me this information.
Call him he seems to know what he's talking about.  Tirerack has
warehouses on both coasts so the shipping usually isn't too much.
