Subject: DIY heated seats

I know the weather is turning nice but nobody has anything to say about putting a heated seat kit in your type 2?

I was thinking that maybe it all got missed at the end of my email from this morning on acount of the ADD.

Check out the IPD website for some cool car accessories, including the DIY heated seats.

Has anybody tried taking seat heaters out of a car at the wrecking yard and stuffing them in their stock Type 2 seats?

JM
