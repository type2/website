&gt; &gt; I don't know for sure on a Vanagon but on a Bay the roof is flatter on the
&gt; &gt; Westy. (from the factory???)  the upstairs bed would not fit right if you
&gt; &gt; just put the top on.
&gt; 
&gt; Bob you are saying that a westy roof clip is different? This is the first
&gt; Ive ever heard this notion come up. 

it is on a bay. not sure about the others, I did have a 65 with the
straight up poptop and the roof was the same on it
