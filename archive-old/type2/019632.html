Subject: High CO Emissions Query

Ok, so I have now officially failed my Atlanta Metro Emissions Test, for
having too high a CO level.  My bus is a '77 with the stock FI.  Here
are the figures, for those of you versed in such things:

HC-ppm: 223 (424 max. allowed) PASS
CO-%: 10.49 (3.74 max. allowed) FAIL !!!!
NO-ppm: 0 (2418 allowed) PASS
RPM: 2056 (1500-3000 allowed) PASS
CO+CO2-%:18.0 (6.0 min. allowed) PASS

BTW, the test is run with the vehicle on rollers going 25mph.

The guy at the test station (the Muffler King) told me that &quot;It's too
rich&quot;, and that I needed to adjust my carb -- this despite the fact that
he'd just been in the engine compartment and should've noticed that it's
fuel injected.  This is the same guy, incidentally, who checked the
driver's door jam for the &quot;NON-CATALYTIC&quot; sticker (which he presumably
saw, since he was looking for it and then looked right at it), and then
check to see if there was a catalytic converter.  Whatever.  Anyway,
this guy's abbreviated explanation didn't inspire confidence; so I
headed home to go through the Bentley, the L-Jet shop manual online
(www.conservatory_dot_com/vw/manuals_nyx/L-Jetronic.html), and the archives
(vw.i405_dot_com).  I plan to have one of my neighborhood VW shops (D&amp;D, on
DeKalb Ave. for you Atlanta types) with $7000 gas analyzer set my ....;
but I'm curious about a couple of possible other possibly contributing
factors.


(1) Exhaust:  What effect on emissions would be expected from a tiny
exhaust leak -- the small EGR pipe on the pipe coming into the left side
of the replacement-type exhaust is pinched off enough to keep it quiet,
but not airtight, I guess.

(2) Could returning the EGR to functionality lower CO levels?  (The EGR
is complete and functioning except that it is blocked off where it
passes through the tin, and the filter is not currently installed.)

(3) Can the type of oil used have an effect on emissions?  I changed the
oil before the test, and I've changed it again in preparation for the
next go at the sniffer; but I'm just using cheapie Advance Auto brand
20W50.

(4) Can the type of gas used have an effect on emissions?

(5) Do those &quot;guaranteed to get you through emissions&quot; addatives really
just clean the system to make it operate better, as the labels explain;
or do they more directly affect the test, by skewing the results (in the
users favor)?  (The brand I have in mind is manufactured by Berryman.)

(6) Is there any chance I could lower CO by retarding the timing for the
duration of the test?

(7) Is there any chance I could lower CO by over- or under-inflating my
tires to lower the rpms?


Assorted other possibly related facts:
-The bus has newish spark plugs and was freshly tuned to specs; and it
was well warmed up before the test.
-After the test, I clamped one vac line that the guy at D&amp;D thought
might be loose and leaking, though not much.

Lastly, when I have the guy with the gas analyzer adjust the idle
mixture adjustment screw on the AFM, I'm going to have him set it at the
Bosch/VW specified 1.0%; however, I will also have him tell me how many
turns (how much of a single turn?) counter-clockwise I need to turn it
after the test to set it back to a richer (cooler/morepowerfuller)
setting.  In the archives, I found a post from Steve Blackham
recommending 1.5-2.0%, and am wondering if any other listees can relate
their experiences with setting idle mixture.
