Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust Stud Replacement

on 6/19/03 16:26, Chris Sheridan related:

&gt; The stock studs were 8mm on one end and 9mm on the business end. They were
&gt; perhaps 102mm or 108mm long, but this is from memory,
&gt; I can't remember

this is way off.

early type IV exhaust studs were 8mm on both ends. later ones are 8x9. i am
not certain of the changeover. a 1700 should have 8 x 8 studs.

both kinds are 56mm long.
