Subject: Changed Fuse Box, but I need help on where my fuses go.70 bus

i changed my fuse box today, and finished color
sanding the bus. One problem I had with the fuse box
is that is completey disinegrated when i remove the
zip ties in which held it together. some of the wires
came off as well and im just going by guess work to
where they go.

this is a '70 only fuse box, my question is what amp
fuses do I need and where do they go? My fuses are red
and white but they dont show the amps.

If anyone has a '70 bus can you please send me pics of
the fuse box front and back so im not guessing as to
what goes where, also my gauge lights have never
worked since i owned the bus and id like to make sure
everything is hooked up right..

TIA,
peace,
