&gt;There is no difference.  The &quot;flat&quot; DP 1600 is an upright or Type 1 engine

&gt;However, you should note that this engine was never marketed by VW in North

I do not completely agree with that. 

A &quot;flat-4&quot; is an engine with four horizontally opposed cylinders, 
regardless of which kind of cooling medium or, in case of an aircooled 
engine, shape of the cooling air cowling is being used. 

The VW &quot;upright&quot;, or Type-1, is a flat-4 with the cooling system on top 
of the crankcase. It was used in the Bug, Bus, type 14 Ghia, Thing, 
and some might want to add the Fridolin, the Brazilia and/or other 
South American models. 

The VW &quot;pancake&quot; is a flat-4 on which the cooling system is mounted on 
the rear of the engine, the fan is mounted on the end of the crankshaft. 
There are three types of VW pancake engines, one uses basically the 
same basic engine as the Bug and the Bus, but it was used in the VW 
type-3, Type 34 Ghia, and the Brazilian Puma coupe, maybe i'm missing 
some models, these started as 1500s and later a 1600 version was added, 
i'm not sure, but if i recall correctly the 1500 was still available 
after the 1600 was introduced, at least in Europe. 

Then there is the second pancake type engine, also known as the Type-4 
engine, it started life in the VW type-4, first with a cast magnesium 
crankcase, just like in the smaller engines, but it was soon replaced 
by an aluminum case. Later this engine was also used in the Porsche 914, 
VW-Porsche 914 and the VW bus in 1700, 1800 and 2000 versions. 

The third type of pancake engine is a bit less common. It was only 
used in 05/'79 to 12/'82 third generation Transporters, there 
were two versions, one was the CT, i don't recall the other code. 
it was a 1600 with an oil filter mount cast onto left case half, 
VWs 070 115 561 oil filter screws onto it, i'm just mentioning that 
here cuz that's the filter that VW specifically designed for our 
beloved engines. This engine also had hydraulic lifters, long reach 
spark plugs and was carbureted by a single carb. It would be possible 
to convert this engine to upright, but not without minor machine work, 
there is no provision to mount the pulley tin that goes in front of the 
pulley on an upright, not even the bosses on the case are there. 
The oilcooler is a regular type-3 cooler, but it did get a new number, 
070 117 021. The oilcooler is mounted a little more to the rear of 
the engine than on an upright engine, that is the point to thinker 
about the most if you want to convert one to upright, although i think 
you could fit a regular upright oilcooler if you cut an opening in the 
fanshroud and mount a spacer between the cooler adaptor and the 
oilcooler, the nice thing is that this spacer comes with this engine, 
normally it is mounted between the oilcooler and the crankcase.

*G* to answer the first gentleman's question, that 1600 DP flat-4, 
-could- be an upright engine, chances are that it is, but it could 
also be a type-3 engine or the 1600 Transporter engine, it could be 
that the 3rd generation Transporters could be had with the 1600 in 
England.
