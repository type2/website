&gt; They sell them at most FLAPS.  I bought one at Kragens a while ago and wish I hadn't.  It's extremely poor quality.  I didn't use it, but if I had I'm sure it would have done more damage than good.  There was were large burrs where the flutes were ground out.  I would have lost a good portion of the good threads had I used this piece or cr*p.

I have a K-D, have had for years, and it's a nice piece. I use it sparingly, and always use a touch of anti-seize, and so far have never CAUSED a spark plug thread loss. Really important you get it in straight. Use fingers only, straight will feel right after a while. Same with the spark plugs.
