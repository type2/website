Subject: Engine Pull Report &amp; Karma Request

Awhile back I asked for a remote diagnosis of a spun cooling fan.  Well, I
finally got around to pulling the engine today and the answer is.....fan.
The center part that's supposed to be oval-ish was roundish....reminded me
of all those darn chinese fan pulleys that have been eaten on the other end
of the shaft....

Also pulled off the cracked generator pedestal....what appeared to be a
hairline crack down at the joint between the base and the riser turned out
to go three-quarters of the way around the riser, and then down through the
base. The base had more or less separated from the riser part. (Esoteric
part question -- the p/n suffix of the old pedestal was 'E', and the one I'm
replacing it is a 'B'...any functional difference? Any reason there'd be at
least 6 revisions of this common part?)

Also found one torn CV boot -- clean off the little end, all the way around.
Did someone have a source of these things that seem to last more than a
year?

Also found that the thermostat had failed (open, of course). Any ideas why
this would happen in only a year?

I also found myself wandering around the garage floor in circles. I've done
the engine pull numerous times over the last 9 years, but my heart doesn't
seem to be in it. I don't know if I'm going crazy or just don't have the
karma to deal with this right now. I've taken the week off and will just
work a little at a time...trying to keep a positive attitude...but it's
getting harder to do good work. I tell myself I'll go up to Jerome on
Saturday if I get everything pulled together, but the carrot doesn't seem to
be working.

So if you have any extra Karma to spare, can I borrow some?

Thanks
