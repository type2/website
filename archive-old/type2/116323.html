Subject: Orange Westfalia in Cooper City

Hey, does anyone own a bright Orange Westfalia in Cooper City?
 
My buddy and I were picking up a 60&quot; TV from his parents house and I noticed
it parked down the street from where he used to live. Just curious if it
belonged to anyone.
 
This would be Cooper City, South Florida.
