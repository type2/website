Subject: [T2] RE: Childs Cot

&gt;&gt;  The child's cot was missing when I bought my '74 and I looked around
until I found one.  Now that I have it, I always leave it at home.  It is a
PITA to install and you will end up scratching your paint.  &lt;&lt;


I bought one incorrect one, and sold it off, and finally found the right one 
from a listmember, (Clark--do you still have your same email?)  Anyways, yes, 
it scratches up your paint a bit :(  but, it does serve as a good place I 
feel to stow your junk to keep things out of the way when campin'.  Not sure 
if I'd trust it w/ my boy in it, but it seems pretty sturdy.  Also, the thing 
I dig about it, is it is OE, and its a decent converstation piece when I'm 
setting stuff up like my front table, rear table, pop top.  I mean, find me 
another car that has a hammock, a full sized closet and a refrig!----- No 
Fiero's or Cavaliers have cool stuff like our Campers!---
