Subject: Re: [T2] Are these new or restored? - 2002 Type 2



&gt; I just got an email back from Jason at beetles-uk_dot_com.  He states
&gt; that the Type 2's are 100%new, built in Brasil and then converted in the
UK.
&gt; They are fuel injected 1600cc with catalytic converter.  After a quick
&gt; currency conversion, it appears that the price quoted for the Rio Camper
is
&gt; approximately $19,250.00 before shipping from the UK, so they are not
&gt; exactly cheap to say the least.  I am not sure of availability of parts
('79
&gt; spec?).

No, 2002 Brazilian spec.  It's the 1600 dual port type 1 engine will all
kinds of parts on it that we've never seen in the US.  I think they would be
hard to get.
I think most of the parts would be unique.  I thought it interesting that it
had the immobilizer, that's an anti-theft system that comes on current
water-cooled VWs.  Means the instrument cluster is totally different as well
as ignition switch, means there is an ECU just for the instruments, etc.
But it is a moot point anyway because:


&gt; Perhaps if a few listees got together and did a group purchase we
&gt; could get a better price from the dealer and do a consolidated shipment in
a
&gt; 40' container ( I think 6 Type 2's should fit in a normal shipping
&gt; container).

No way no how can you bring these into the U.S.  I'm sure if you could it
would be done and I'd have one :-)
Apparently the UK has somewhat more lax vehicle requirements but in the U.S.
these vehicles would have to be DOT and EPA certified for 2002 safety and
emissions requirements.  Hmm no airbags, or side impact door beams.  I sure
don't have the money to custom-engineer and certify such systems.  The
engine is not EPA certified so good luck with that, I know it costs the
manufacturers lots of $$$ to do that.  Guaranteed you wouldn't meet 2002
emissions requirements with it.
