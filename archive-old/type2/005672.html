&gt; Hi folks!
&gt; I need to replace a 79 westy engine with shot main bearings, and serious
&gt; oil
&gt; leaks.  I was curious if anyone had one available in good shape or knew
&gt; of a good
&gt; place to get one around Fort Collins/Boulder CO area.  I've been running
&gt; a weber
&gt; progressive and would like to avoid fuel injection.  At this point I am
&gt; considering replacing the whole engine rather than risking a rebuild on
&gt; the
&gt; current one, and any advice regarding this would be greatly
&gt; appreciated.  Has
&gt; anyone had experience with the holland rebuilt engines which my mechanic
&gt; suggested
&gt; I purchase?
&gt; Let me know what you've got, and feel free to reply to me so as not to
&gt; bother the
&gt; other list members.
&gt; Thanks much, and happy driving to all,
&gt; mark
&gt;
