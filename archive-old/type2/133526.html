&gt; Not that advanced. I was just on camp maintenance crew when I was in
&gt; college. I don't even remember what they sent me to the pump house for.....

I had a pool operators license when I was a lifeguard and swim instructor
at a camp pool and the YMCA pool while in college and they were pretty
emphatic about how deadly Chorine gas was, we ALWAYS had gas masks on our
hips when we went into the tank room, slightest wiff and get it on in a
hurry, get out, lock door to tank room, evacuate, get help  FAST!


not something to mess with

it was used as a chemical warfare agent in WWI,

don't mess with it
