Subject: Clutch problem.

Ok, maybe a big problem.....maybe not, .....the thing is I don't know.

While Bread Box is turned off, I can push the clutch pedal with about 1/2 
inch of play up and it returns, normal spring pressure. I can shift the gears 
fine, and they feel like the shift as usual too.

I can start the bus in neutral, and she starts right up. .....However, if I 
try to change gears while it is running, it jumps and cuts off, as if I was 
switching gears without pushing in the clutch. If I try to start it up in 
gear, with the clutch down, it jumps like the clutch wasn't held down. I have 
good freeplay, and the tranny should be pretty good.

Any suggestions, conclusions?

Thanks

Chris
