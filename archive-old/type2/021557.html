-Check all of your spark plug wires (try swapping or buy new ones if
they're old)
-Get new plugs (couldn't hurt)
-change out the injector seals
-test the injectors (good thing to do while changing seals)
-UNLESS YOU HAVE NEW FUEL LINES, CHANGE YOUR FUEL LINES NOW!  It's cheap
insurance and it's much easier when you have the injectors out!
-Heed all safety warnings when playing with fuel :)
-Check your valve clearances
-Try swapping injector connectors - don't worry about mixing them up,
they all fire at the same time
-Make sure the spark plug wires coming off the distributor cap are going
to the correct cylinders
-Check the distributor cap to see if there's major buildup
-Do a compression test on all the cylinders
-Check your fuel pressure

umm.. can't think of anything else.. but I'm sure someone else can :)

later,
Mike

&gt; hi everyone
&gt; 
&gt; I drove my bus for the first time tonite, from my vw mechanic's shop
&gt; home... about 5 miles. I was excited and nervous at the same time to
&gt; finally be able to drive her. All went well. For a bus that sat for 4
&gt; years with no engine, she rode extreamly smooth. I guess this would be her
&gt; first trip report :)
&gt; 
&gt; I posted the otherday about my vw guy telling me that the engine was only
&gt; running on 2 cylinders. When I went to his shop this morning he showed me
&gt; what exactly he was talking about. He took some starting fluid and sprayed
&gt; it on different parts of the engine. When he sprayed it on the left side
&gt; intake runner it reved up really nice then died back to a slower idle a
&gt; few seconds later. When he sprayed it to where intake runners connect to
&gt; the central air induction unit it did the same. Spraying to the right side
&gt; intake runners did nothing. So, I guess this would mean there is a leak on
&gt; the left side #3 and #4. When he pulled the plug wires on those cylinders
&gt; there was no change in the idle. So sure enough shes only running on 2
&gt; cyls....
&gt; 
&gt; When I put the engine in i replaced the old intake runners with ones off a
&gt; porsche 914. the old ones were rusted pretty bad. My vw guy said that
&gt; sometimes they warp, letting air get it and do exactly this. I put on new
&gt; manifold to head gaskets on and new runner boots as well. He said it could
&gt; also be the injector seals. He gave me a new set to put on as well as a
&gt; new intake runner for that side. He woudl have done it, but I had just
&gt; paid $625 for an entire brake job so,being a bit short on $$ I'll have to
&gt; deal with this one on my own ;)
&gt; 
&gt; My questions:
&gt; this is my intended plan of attack. I'm gonna clean up that new intake
&gt; runner, get it good and clean/smooth as well as the mating face on the
&gt; head. install the new intake runner (should I use any sealant? didn't
&gt; before and the job failed....) I also plan to clamp the boots on. I figure
&gt; it couldn't hurt any.
&gt; 
&gt; A question:
&gt; when he did the brakes he said he couldn't get the brake pedal from
&gt; dropping with the speed of the engine. When you rev it faster, the pedal
&gt; falls with the engine speed. He said it was probably the same leak
&gt; problem. He tried 4 booster valves and the all did the same thing. He put
&gt; it on backwards to override the power assist for the time being. Just so I
&gt; could get it home :)
&gt; Could it be related, or is that something else... like the servo?
&gt; 
&gt; Comment:
&gt; I can't beleive this thing is only running on 2 cyls.. I mean, i saw with
&gt; my own eyes that when he pulled the wires it had no effect, and this is
&gt; bad. BUT I GOT THE THING UP TO 40MPH ON THE WAY HOME THAT WAY!!! is that
&gt; possible? It was weak... but I would not expect a 4 cyl engine to run that
&gt; good on only 2 cyls. Maybe it just does. That would also be a good
&gt; explination as to why it smells so bad.
&gt; 
&gt; Could a false or incorrect vaccum line connection cause any of the above
&gt; symptoms? If anyone has any advise or corrections to what I have stated it
&gt; would be very much appreciated..
&gt; 
&gt; thank you all so very much for reading
