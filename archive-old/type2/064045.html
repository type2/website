Subject: unusual paint code request

Compadres:

I have been lurking for awhile.  The 36hp motor resto is taking
next to forever.  Good news is that the engine may come back 
from the machine shop within the next couple of months.  

Anyway, I have two questions for everyone.... 

        1)  Does anyone know the paint codes for the black and 
            gray colors for the engine pieces?  I want to track
            down that particular semi-gloss gray that one sees
            on the intake and exhaust pieces.  Furthermore, what
            particular semi-gloss black paint went on the engine
            tin?

        2)  Does anyone know where to score a rebuilt kit for a 
            28 PCI carbuerator?  Better yet, does anyone have a 
            line on a next to perfect condition 28 PCI carb?

Thanks in advance...
