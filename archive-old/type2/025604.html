I'm confused. The engine stalled and wouldn't start again. Spent an hour
going over the fuel injection, the usual culprit, but couldn't find anything
wrong.

Then I found someone to crank the starter while I checked for spark from the
coil's main terminal (#4), it was weak and blue-ish. Checked again from the
end of a sparkplug wire and got no spark at all at that end.

So I replaced the Pertronix with standard points and condenser; still no go.

Then I checked voltage between the coil's terminal 15 and 1 (as suggested in
Bentley) and found a quasi-zero 7 millivolts, as opposed to the minimum
9.6V. I do get over 12 Volts between terminal 15 and the engine case,
though.

Replaced the coil, but get the same voltage readings and the problem
remains. Both old and new coil have 3.6 Ohm resistance between terminals 15
and 1. Old coil has a resistance of 3500 Ohm between terminals 15 and 4; the
new coil about twice that.

Oh, and I also replaced cap and rotor.

TIA for your suggestions :)

Sami
