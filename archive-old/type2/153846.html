Subject: A few things left to finish up my Bus...

Hey guys, my Bus is almost done, and I've got a few questions that I'd like to
ask to just get it out of the way, so I can get these last few important items
finished.

1 - I have an 1800cc rebuilt motor that runs well after it's warmed up.
However, ONE lifter tends to rattle like crazy for about 10 minutes when I
first start it. It has hydraulic lifters. I know it's coming from the driver
side. With that said, what do I do? The lifter is actually in the block
itself, is it not? Behind the pushrod tube? My pushrod tubes don't look like
they &quot;come off&quot; easily... so does that mean I'll have to remove the cyl head
if I need to replace the lifter? What advice would you guys give me in terms
of checking it first? It IS hydraulic, but I'm wondering if maybe it's just
loosened up... do I need to adjust the rocker arms and tighten that one down?
Or do I need to loosen it because it's not able to pump up enough? (I just
don't know).


2 - Where can I get a replacement air filter for my webber 2-bbl progressive
carburetor?

3 - Is there a better distributor to have than my mechanical advance
distributor? I don't have a vacuum port on it, will I see any improvement in
power anywhere by going with a regular distributor that has a vacuum advance?

4 - I've replaced the shift plate inside the Bus, but the shift from 1st to
2nd is still very difficult (grinds sometimes because it feels like it's
trying to go into reverse). Do I just need to replace bushings or
something???

5 - The inside of my Bus LOOKS like the interior might have been wall-papered
with that vinyl matting. All that is left now is some hard, dry, adhesive
glue. How can I get that off?



Thanks!!!

Todd
