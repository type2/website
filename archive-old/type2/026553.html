&gt;Well fifty miles into the 143 mile dirve the little red oil can lit up.
&gt;I pulled over immedatly and than watched all the oil drip out of 
&gt;the engine.  

Any other symptoms?  Like bad noises or loss of power?  Depending on where
the oil leaked out from, it may be a simple (inexpensive) fix.  Your engine
may still require a rebuild or replacement within the next year or 2, but
depending on you budget, replacing a blown oil seal may be the route to go
short term.

&gt;I just got the call that I need a new motor.  The whole shabang 
&gt;is gonna cost us $2400 with a 12mo/12K mile warrenty.  Ouch!  
&gt;On to the question....  Is this too much.  If so what do I do.  

If these guys have a good reputation with the locals for quality, I'll
believe you.  But I can tell you they DON'T have a reputation as a
reasonably priced shop.

Unless you put a rod through the side of the case, it is unlikely you need a
&quot;new&quot; engine.  And if you do, I think (others may have more accurate numbers
here) that a complete type IV long block engine can be had with warranty for
around $1200 - $1500.  That means that the shop is charging you $900 - $1200
to remove the old engine and install the new one and make sure everything is
running right.  For a competent shop, that process should be about 4-6
hours.  So I think their estimate is way too high.

If you order a new engine (not from GEX!!!!!!), you CAN install it yourself.
Engine removal/installation is not a big deal in a bus as long as you have a
place to work on it, some basic tools (including a floor jack for rolling
the engine out from underneath), and the desire to get greasy.
