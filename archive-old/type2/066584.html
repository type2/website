&gt;We have a '79 Camper with a scant 106,000 miles on it, less than 6,000
&gt;on the rebuilt engine. 

At this stage of the game what would be of more practical interest to me is
how many miles folks got out of a  t-4  rebuild and who did the work. Maybe
there are acouple of outstanding shops out there. 

See ya on the road
