Coming off of the fuel pump there is a red wire that goes to a bolt on the bracket, at this braket the wire has a &quot;y&quot; and becomes 2 wires, one wire goesi nto the body of the heater, the other eone is hanging loos with no connectoer on the end.  WHERE DOES THIS WIRE GO???  Anticipating heat, John Baker
