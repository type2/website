&gt; No doubt.  But then if it runs long enough to brag about, it's not a &quot;junk
&gt; engine&quot;, is it?  And congratulations to those who can take a perfectly
&gt; matched and professionally rebuilt pay-through-the-nose engine and trash it
&gt; in 30k miles.  They should get an award for their ignorance.

Well said.
As an additional FYI:
Only the pushrods/lifters were choice used. I only mentioned those since that
was the topic.
The bus itself had at least 192,000 miles on it. The reason I say 'at least' is
because that is what the odometer showed when I bought the Westy. However, the
bus lost 1/10th of a mile for each mile I drove it because of a cracked gear in
the speedo. I did not know how long it was that way before I bought it.
It used a quart of oil every 100 miles. So I pulled the engine and disassembled
it. I found no damage to the bottom end. The main and rod journals were still
standard, the cam lobes were still like new. I only needed all new bearings. The
pistons and cylinders were junk, so I replaced them. I questioned the list about
NPR P &amp; C's.... just about everyone pooh-poohed those. Well, I am VERY happy
with them also. The heads were fine. No guide wear. All I had to do was remove
carbon. The valve seats and valve faces were fine. After lapping them with fine
compound, nothing else was needed.
