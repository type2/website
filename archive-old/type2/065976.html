Subject: Re: Flywheel System Logic

&gt;Can anybody substantiate this 100,000 rpm business? Isn't that what
&gt;somebody said? I don't know squat about this, but just having played with
&gt;they gyroscope I got for the kids it seems to me like a heavy flywheel
&gt;spinning that fast could flop a passenger car over on its side as a matter
&gt;of course if you tried to contradict it...
&gt;
&gt;--Ken
&gt;  68 Westy

&gt;From the article in DISCOVER:

 &quot;Twelve inches in diameter, three inches thick, Bitterly's magnum
    opus rotates inside a tubby aluminum canister that looks thick
     enough to stop bullets. The complete &quot;flywheel system,&quot; including
     container, weighs 90 pounds. The wheel alone-r-a hefty
platter--weighs 50. It's made of densely packed carbon fibers
     similar to the high-strength graphite used nowadays in everything
     from golf clubs to Stealth bombers. Bitterly's wheel needs that
     strength. The idea is to spin it fast enough to run a car. For that
     purpose, &quot;fast enough&quot; turns out to be 100,000 revolutions per
     minute. Every second, in other words, this wheel turns 1,700
     circles. Matter on the rim screams around at 3,700 miles per
     hour--roughly the rspeed of a bullet. But the screaming is only
virtual, because the flywheel spins in a vacuum. There's no air to
     slow it, and no other friction to speak of. The wheel floats
     gracefully in empty space, collared in magnetic bearings that never
     quite touch its whirling axle.&quot;


To which I add:

Flipping the vehicle is only a possibility if the the flywheels are
oriented incorrectly.  If you lay the flat like a record turntable, the
will simply act to reduce body roll in turns.  Or will they?  I think they
might try to lift the vehicle or press it down, depending on the direction
of rotation and the direction of the turn.  But with 16 of them you could
mount them in self canceling groups.  Opposite rotations haveing opposite
effects.  This would tend to put a lot of stress on the structure of the
vehicle though.  But maybe even that could be harnessed, using peizocrystal
mounts or something.  I am a little out of my depth here but very curious.

Bob Hoover should be able to comment on this.  Twin engine planes with
contra-rotating props produce no &quot;left turning tendency&quot;,when you lift the
nose, the way a single does.  The props are like big gyros and the have the
gyroscopic effects that we are discussing.

Bob?

Am I right about the self cancelling pairs (or trios or whatever)??

How much stress are we talking about? - the diameter is much smaller but
the rpm's much higher.  What does a typical prop weigh?  eg. C172.
