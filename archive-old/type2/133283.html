&gt; IT IS VERY DANGEROUS TO SWITCH TO AN ELECTRIC FUEL PUMP
&gt;
&gt; If you switch from a mechanical fuel pump to an electrical fuel pump, you
&gt; may create a very dangerous condition unless you go to great lengths to
&gt; properly wire up the electrical fuel pump.
&gt;
&gt; The most dangerous thing you can do is to give the electric fuel pump
&gt; electricity from the hot wire on the coil. This is un-acceptable.

very true, common mistake

&gt; All factory manufactured cars with electric fuel pumps have a fail safe
&gt; systems to shut off the electric fuel pump in case of a wreck.
&gt;
&gt; If you aren't willing to spend some time adding a complicated fail safe
&gt; wiring system for the electric fuel pump, then do not install it. The
&gt; original equipment mechanical fuel pump is much safer and much more
&gt; reliable.
&gt;
&gt; If you insist on using the non-standard electrical fuel pump, then you must
&gt; wire it to be failsafe with at least a couple of failsafe systems.

a simple way to wire it is with an oil presure switch, however you will
have to crank the engine enough to build up oil presure before the fuel
pump will start, (or use a relay thru the starter) but a carb engine will
usually fire with the fuel in the carb and that will immediately run up
the oil presure if your engine is even half decent.

if you wreck and your engine stalls the oil presure will drop and shut off
the fuel pump.

&gt; Use a couple of relays to power the
&gt; electric fuel pump. Put a fuse in all the lines carrying current in this
&gt; Rube Goldberg setup. For the first relay, you can probably run a trigger
&gt; wire from the starter solenoid just like in the VW example above. This will
&gt; only power the electric fuel pump when the starter motor is engaged. Then
&gt; use a second relay with an &quot;intelligent&quot; &quot;running engine&quot; relay trigger
&gt; input from
&gt; somewhere else. This must be an electrical signal that is only present when
&gt; the engine is actually running and not just when the key is turned on. Do

an oil presure sensor switch,

Bob
