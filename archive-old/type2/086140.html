Subject: RE: [T2] RE: PopTop Seal--Prices!!

&gt; Sorry Ron but your seal is exactly what is offered by McMaster.
&gt; I have your seal and have viewed the seal in their catalog and is
&gt; an exact match


I know exactly what the McMaster seal is, because I know who manufactures it
for them and precisely to what specs.  I also know precisely what specs I
use on my own seal. They are not exactly the same.  However, they do look
similar enough that I could see how you might think they were, if going by a
picture in a catalog.
