Subject: No 'GEN' Light or fuel pump

Volks,
Since putting the new engine in Speedy after having it 
out for 5 weeks, a few things happened.

1)  The fuel pump quit pumping.  I replaced the fuel 
pump with a super-crappy replacement from the FLAPS, 
but I'd like my old pump back.  The replacement has a 
plastic foot for the rod to actuate against.  Ugh!

2)  The 'GEN' light doesn't come on anymore.  Not sure 
what wire's not connected anymore, and it still fires, 
I assume because its a fresh battery.  Once it's out 
of charge, I'm afraid I'll be stranded.

Any ideas on either?


Later,

Simon
