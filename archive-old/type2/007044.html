Hi All,
After VW bailing out of doing my valve job, in Clementine, ( they told
me after 2 weeks of sitting there that it was too time consuming of a
job ) I have decided to do it myself.
I have one question----
The Bentley says that with an automatic trans., the engine can be
lowered without removing the trans.
In the VW repair manual, it says that the trans. has to come out with
the engine.
Which is true?

Other than tis small discrepency, it doesn't look like that big of a
deal.

The heads are going to Boston Engine, for stainless valves, and nickel
seats.

I would like for this to be a one time job, so I am going to do the best
for the engine that I can in using the high dollar valves, and seats.( I
wanted titanium valves but they are really big denaro's )

Any other things that I should be watching out for?

Any suggestions?

Thanks Much,
