What's the difference between a 30 year old German hubcap and a new Mexican 
hubcap?

    The rusty one is Mexican!!!

Where do you find a new German hubcap?

    On someone else's bus!!!

Where do you find a new Mexican hubcap?

   Usually, after hitting a chuck hole, about 20-30 feet ahead of my bus, 
heading into the oncoming traffic, where it is quickly crushed and 
mangled!!!

Where do you find a 30 year old german hubcap?

    On someone else's bus!!! (Is there really any difference between a new 
and a 30 year old German hubcap??  Naaaa!!)

Where do you find a 30 year old Mexican hubcap?

    OK, now you are really getting silly...  Nowhere ! ! !

Barry sends.  (What's a 'chuck hole'?)
