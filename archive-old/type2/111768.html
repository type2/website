&gt; After my bus was painted I went on vacation with it for 2 weeks and started

&gt; normal except that I've noticed that the rear vent window was incorrectly
&gt; installed:

Make sure both the upper and lower tabs on the vertical bar of the vent
wing are over the lip of the body flange.  From the pictures it looks like
at least one has popped out.  If this is so you are going to have to
remove and reinstall the window.

                             OOK!
