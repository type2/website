Subject: Corrosion protection

I used to use lps 3 when I was in Hawaii.  Lived right by the ocean and the salt
air and spray corroded things almost right before your eyes.  I use to just
spray that LPS 3 on any bare metal and I got a nice waxy/oily coat which  really
held up.. Not too sightly and tends to collect dirt  a bit (as recall).  Another
Idea I've been considering is to spray my whole undercarriage with &quot;rust
reformer&quot; (which is a benzoic acid emulsion).  I'd want to make sure all the
surfaces to be treated had been cleaned of all oil or grease.  John Jensen in
