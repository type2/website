&gt; I friend looked at a local bus here in Sacramento today which had no

&gt; the driver's side, this Bus used to have the Sink/Fridge/Stove behind
&gt; the seats.  My friend wonders, if he buys this Bus, how hard would it
&gt; be to find the kitchen unit and what would he call it when speaking
&gt; to Bus enthusiasts?

You describe the SO-69 Westfalia cabinet.  They are rather difficult to
obtain in the United States.  This was an European model that was never
sold by US dealers.  Some were imported by individuals but not many.
There is a picture of the cabinet in the type2 library at:
