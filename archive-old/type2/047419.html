Subject: [T2] my trip report - why every damn time?

Hello,

So I took my 75 Transporter from San Francisco, CA to Bend, Or.

First, I wanted to get back to stock so right before I left I finally got a 
new vacuum advance for the distributor for my bus so I took it back to the 
mechanic that took the old one out and let me use the one from his 76 for a 
while, and they pulled their 76 distributor out and threw my 75 back in with 
the new vacuum on it. the 75s are a lot different than the 76, having both 
advance and retard on them.

anyway, I get that installed and they notice the pipe going from the EGR 
canister to the exhaust is broken, and even though 3 months ago they 
installed it, they wanted me to go someplace else to get it welded back into 
place. Also, they say I should really get my valves adjusted again since its 
been sucking in air or something. I have to leave in 4 hours, and I have to 
drive around before then, I simply cannot do it.

I get the pipe back into place, round up the group (4 humans and a puppy) 
and start making our way out of town.

First thing im noticing, every time I go to these guy they set up the timing 
at what they call &quot;full advance&quot; he set his light at 38 degrees and pulled 
it full throttle to set it there. I dont like the idea of setting it here, 
and quite frankly I dont think my bus does either.

As soon as I start driving I can tell a slight loss in power, it idles 
really low when im not moving, and while im at full speed it will sorta chug 
a little every once in a while. Like a small hesitation of some sort. its 
used to do this all the time at low idle, but it would buck preally hard, 
and after random things being done it just sorta stopped.

After it kept getting worse and worse, I finally noticed the distributor cap 
handt been clipped into place!!! these guys have been referred to me as some 
of the absolute best guys to work on old veedubs, but right now I can say 
ill never go back.

I clip the cap back into place, and try setting the idle a little higher 
just using that little screw on the FI.

That seemed to help, and luckily by the time we hit Mt Shasta is wasnt 
hesitating anymore and even climbed host of the hills without needed to go 
too terribly slow.

Bend was really cold (in comparison from where I started) and the bus 
couldnt have ran better the whole time we were in town driving around. But 
when the reutnr trip came along it would hesitate at high speeds every so 
often, kinda chug if you will. I burned a little more oil that usual, about 
a quart over the whole trip (about 1200 miles).

I havent touched it since I pulled in the driveway, but im scared as to what 
I might be dealing with now.

I am sure I need to start some maintenence, but how much? ill dump the oil 
and oil filter, set the timing, and perhaps attempt the valves (i havent 
done that myself yet) anything else I should check out?

Luckily I have access to another car for now, but this is my daily driver so 
pretty soon ill have to get it going again.


oh, and the heat seems to work just fine, as long as I dont care about my 
feet being frozen. whoh, I had to stop and put on more socks at one point. 
Maybe I should pick up a little lighter-adapter style heater next time i go 
north?
