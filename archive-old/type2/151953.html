&gt; I am pretty sure that the motor is from a 65 bus I have. So I cant just take

well with one of my VW's can't remember which I did do something like
that. it was all 12v except the starter because of the flywheel I think
but worked fine for years, boy would that thing crank, just don't hold the
key down very long......

hmmmm, thinking about it, might have been my &quot;S&quot; motor
