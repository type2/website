 Oregon]

We travel in Oregon a lot, and always find this procedure very annoying.

I've found that most of the pump jockeys have ZERO experience with fueling
VW buses, and are a bit
off-balance before they even find the gas filler.  I tell them that if they
don't do the job just right they'll cause some expensive damage, for which
they'll be held responsible.  Nine times out of ten they just hand me the
nozzle and walk away.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  It doesn't bother me all that much, as my '71 has a huge filler opening
that they can't miss, but they still manage to give the side of the bus a
liberal gas-rinse.  If I had a later bay I would be very uptight with their
fragile rubber filler pipes.  I used to ride a motorcycle while travelling
and found the gas attendent most accommodating.  They would turn on the pump
and hand me the nozzle in most cases.  &lt;&lt;
