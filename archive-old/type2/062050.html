Subject: Re: 74 Westy Rebuild?

Hi folks,

Well two weeks ago I became the proud owner of a 74 Westy; the PO had
purchased it from a VW mechanic and so it was in great shape until he took
over.  The PO said that it ran rough and so had taken it to a VW dealer who
had done a compression test and had found that one cylinder had zero
compression.  Otherwise it was in great shape so I forked out my 500 bucks
and became the proud owner.  Now the problem is that I will most likely
either have to rebuild the engine myself or pay someone to do it.  I am
fairly mechanically inclined but have never done any major work on a car
before and I'm wondering if I will be able to do this work myself or should
I just give up and let someone else do it.  I'm in no hurry to get the job
done and would rather take a few months to struggle through myself than pay
someone to do it but I'm a little worried about not being able to do it.
From the zero compression on that cylinder I'm guessing that I've either got
a burnt out valve, or something wrong with the piston. Any comments as to
what else I should change/rebuild or what I should get someone else to do
would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance
