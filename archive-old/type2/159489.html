Subject: Re: [T2] clutch pedal question

&gt; I was told to NEVER leave home without it. And a fan belt. And ignition 
&gt; parts. And gaskets. And oil.

All this talk of cables breaking reminds me of when my clutch broke and 
I had to speedshift all the way back to my parents house in Redwood city 
from north of SF!  That was not the most pleasant experience, especially 
going through the TOLL BOOTH!!!

hehe..
Mike
