Gary hit the nail right on the head.

I was travelling over the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, back to my home near Orange, 3 hours west of Sydney.

A big 18 wheeler(or there abouts -  they seem to have more than 18 these days ;-) was tearing along the flat sections, which there are a few in the Blue Mountains because the road follows the ridges, but couldn't of course hold the speed up the hills.

The speed limit varies constantly as you pass through little villages &amp; yet he was 10 or 20 kms above the speed limit almost continually.

But yours truly could match him &amp; raise him up hills in my 2.0l Microbus &amp; even could've beaten him on the flat, had I chosen to play the same game he was playing.

He ended up behind me anyway &amp; was forced to drop into low gear as we descended a very steep pass at the western side of the mountains &amp; I left him behind for good.

O.k., so my bus doesn't climb hills at a steady 110kmh(70mph), but I'll rip down the freeway some times past a small Japanese 4 cylinder car that is trundling along 20kmh below the speed limit only to be passed by it 30 seconds later as it vibrates &amp; careers along like an epileptic acid freak on rollerskates(&amp; I have have epilepsy so I've got a good idea how it would look :-).

I like to give people a scare &amp; I can't wait until the supercharged 1640cc is put in my splitty one day(yes I can hear the  vintage fans gasp in horror ;-)........that'll make them need to change their under wear :-)

Cheers
