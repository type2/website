Subject: RE: Subaru conversion

&gt; For years I've heard of these as the conversion engines and someone
&gt; described
&gt; them as &quot;boxer&quot; engines the other day. Anyone on the list actually done or
&gt; seen one of these?

	Since conversions seem to be a hot topic at the moment maybe you
should all checkout my web site (shameless plug here) it's called Wild VW's
and has two V8 buses (including my own) two V6 powered buses, one a
midmounted twin cab and a Subaru powered bus.  As well as several other Wild
Vw's including V8 bugs etc and general wierd VW stuff.

	It's at http://www.geocities_dot_com/MotorCity/Garage/1811 I wouldn't
mind getting some pics of any other Bus conversions out there so drop me an
email if you've got some.

	Cheers
	Steve
