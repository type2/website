Subject: RE: heat - how long propane
Date: Mon, 23 Oct 2000 16:09:16 -0400

Someone asked how long propane would last with a 12000 BTU burner.
Your typical gas BBQ is around 45000 BTU and a tank lasts many hours?
So figure the burner can run three times as long as your BBQ. However
the burner in the furnace is probably  only on 1/5 of the time you have
the bus furnace on?
