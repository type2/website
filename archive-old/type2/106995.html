&gt;Have they raised the price yet?  You have to
&gt;figure the core charge or price of shipping 4
&gt;core wheels to gowesty.  That has to be steep. 

GoWesty quoted me about $50 shipping for four wheels from Cali to Texas.  They didn't ask for a core so they must already have a good stock of them.  Judging by the number of wheels I've seen in the wrecking yards over the years that could be had for $10/each or less, this doesn't exactly suprise me.  They probably accumulated them for a while before they started selling the 15&quot; ones.

I saw a set of wheels similar to these a few years ago.  It was in a parking lot in Phoenix where we were waiting to set out on a caravan to Jerome.  There was a guy there with a late-bay doublecab (imported of course!) who told me he had the wheels custom made at a shop in LA.  Price was about $100/wheel and of course you had to bring your old wheels to them.  GoWesty's price of $400/set shipped seems quite reasonable to me.  If they raised the price, it could be because their stock is dwindling.  I would do it also if I were in their shoes.  I respect them for having the wheels available at any price.

&gt;Bentley.  See page 8-42.  It lists only the size
&gt;(185R14 commercial or 185R14 reinforced) and max
&gt;tire pressure and not the max load.  I'm not
&gt;aware of a spec for max load, except that the max
&gt;load often quoted is the max load for the tire
&gt;that meets the max pressure given by Bentley. 

Interesting - I've seen that 1540 number quoted as gospel so many times on the list that I just assumed it was in print somewhere.  I am not one to believe in interpolation here as I've seen plenty of examples just in the last 2 hours of tires with the same load rating and different max pressure values.  In fact it looks to me as if max pressure is related to the style of tire rather than the load rating.  For instance, the Bridgestone Turanza LS-T lists max inflation pressure as 44psi across every size tire, from an 82-rated 175/70-13 to a 98-rated 215/65-16.

Looking at the information in the type2 Library under tires, I see the Michelin MX Reinforced in 185R14 listed as an appropriate choice for a bus tire.  It has a max load of 1540lbs and max psi of 40.  But elsewhere 50psi is listed as minimum spec for a bus (I assume this is from Bentley).  So what exactly does max inflation pressure tell us about how the tire behaves?  My guess is that it is only an indicator and not an absolute.  Non-reinforced tires with 35psi max would suggest a problem to me, but a 35 max psi alone would not.

As for load ratings, I think they are more straightforward than most people believe.  *I* believe they are the maximum static load that should be applied to the tire and nothing more.  Other factors such as the profile of the vehicle are compensated for by the reinforcement of the tire, not the load rating.

Note that in general as the aspect ratio of a tire increases, so does the load rating with all else being equal.  That means given a load range C tire in 195 width, a 70-series tire will have a higher load rating than a 65-series which will have a higher load rating than a 60-series.  This is in black and white on tirerack_dot_com (look at the link for &quot;Specs&quot; for a given tire).

My conclusions - a reinforced tire is key.  That means a load rating of C or D and/or the word &quot;Reinforced&quot; on the tire.  Max inflation pressure not critical.  Maximum load should never be exceeded and have some safety margin left over.

My current tires are load range C, 50psi max, 1520 max load at 50psi.  I keep them inflated to 40psi which means my actual load capacity is approximately 10% less or 1370lbs.  Do I lose sleep over this?  Hell no - why should I?  It's well above the weight of my heaviest wheel.

I just found this page on the Tirerack web site:

http://tirerack_dot_com/tires/tiretech/tirespecskey.html

This is a goldmine of information, especially where max load and max pressure are concerned.  I suggest that anyone with any questions about these specifications read this page carefully.

&gt;&gt; Continental LS 23 215/65-15 109/107R (that's
&gt;&gt; 2149lbs reinforced)
&gt;
&gt;No, that would be no problem, obviously.

Okay then we agree that there are some 215/65-15 tires that would work well on GoWesty's 15x7 rims on a bus.  And they are even reasonably priced at $78/each.

No offense meant. 
&gt;Ray

None taken.  I'm just trying to keep things in perspective.
