Subject: Pulling a steering wheel

In pulling the steering wheel off of a 72 bus, shouldnt it just pull 
straight off once you take the large nut off? I cant get mine to budge. Im 
almost thinking about getting some kind of gear puller since I am replacing 
the wheel anyways. I tried hitting upwards on the bottom of the wheel and 
even taping on the center shaft while pulling upwards. I cant get it to move 
at all. Any suggestions on how to get the dang thing off ?

Thanks,
David
