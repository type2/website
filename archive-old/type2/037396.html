Subject: Long distance Towing

Hi Folks,

Due to the incredible generosity of a list-member, I'm planning on towing a
1979 van from NH to Toronto (approx. 700 miles) next weekend. I'll be using
a tow dolly  to pull it back, should be a nice slow, easy cruise.

Any advice on route recommendations (What to avoid, what NOT to miss) would
be appreciated. I'm planning on travelling the Niagra - Buffalo - Syracuse -
Albany route, then SE to New Hampshire.

The van in question has no transmission, but the axles are still in place.
The owner has heard that moving the van without the transmission may damage
the wheel bearings. Is that so?

If it is,  would there be any problem towing the van with the rear wheels on
the dolly instead?

Thanks,
