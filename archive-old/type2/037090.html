Greetings Friends of the bus,

    My 75 Westy didn't have as good a time in Santa Cruz Ca. as she should 
have. Going up the summit she began to lug and chug. I had her towed into 
town where she fired right up. On the way home I filled the tank and she ran 
great until we got to Half Moon Bay. There she coasted to a stop without 
warning or warning lights. Temps didn't appear abnormal, nor any unusual 
noises. Since then she will turn over for about ten seconds and no more. I'm 
doing my best to inspect the FI any guidance would be appreciated. Thank-you.

Mike 75 Westy &quot;Willemina&quot;
Sonoma, Ca
