Subject: Of Distributors: the 205 is the one to get...not the 009

Well, I finally got around to changing out my 009 distributor for a VW 205, 
that thankfully did not sell at the Manassas bug show, it eliminated the 
hesitation just off idle that took running a bit rich to eliminate.  Engine now runs 
stronger with the new distributor.

Just thought I would let you folks to get a vacuum advanced distributor.
I get set it to TDC and full 34 degrees advance on my custom T4 engine.

I now have a 009 for sale, any takers?

Robert
