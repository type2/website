When I had similar problems with the clutch on my 
'73 Kombi, I found  that my pilot bearing, which centers
the transmission input shaft, had failed.  The clutch was
actually working but the chewed up needles in the pilot 
bearing had seized the flywheel to the transmission input shaft.

The new pilot bearing cost about 4 dollars but I had to pull the
engine and remove the flywheel to replace the bearing.

See you later,

&gt;I just encountered my first problem with the 78 bus that I bought a few
&gt;weeks ago.
&gt;
&gt;As I was driving down a busy road (at rush hour!), I depressed the clutch,
&gt;stopped at a red light, and took the bus out of gear. When the light turned
&gt;green, I stepped on the clutch and tried to shift into first. I couldn't get
&gt;it to go into gear.
&gt;
&gt;After fiddling with it for a few minutes, I finally got it into first. But,
&gt;there was a problem. When I put my foot on the clutch, the bus still wanted
&gt;to move forward. Shifting was absolute hell.
