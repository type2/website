&gt;When you compare apples to apples, you will get more than 6 hp, and besides 
the gland nut, you get an aluminum case,
&gt;bigger/stronger bearings, rods, and crankshaft, bigger clutch, better 
pushrod tubes, factory alternator, etc..  I don't want to turn
&gt;this into a full-blown religious argument, and I certainly wouldn't try and 
talk you or anyone else into getting rid of your bus just
&gt;to get a type IV engine.  It's just a matter of choice, and I choose the 
type IV.  :)

I choose both. I think both motors have their advantages. 
After struggling for a long time, I finally rebuilt a type 4 motor and 
got it right. I put it in a van and it drove away and I was left with a 71 
bus. Now it's time to get a type 1 motor right, I'm not 
talking about rebuilding it, it might not be necessary, but getting it right 
means getting it to a place where
I can drive it all summer with no problems. Thats the goal of all this, after 
all, regardless of motor type. 
The 71 I will call Robespierre, because it's pop-top was guillotined by the 
previous owner.
