Subject: Type 4 hose-head question

Howdy all,

I'm still putting my 1800cc Type 4 dual-carb'd engine together,
replacing the 009 with a stock vac. adv/retard dizzy. First off, let me
say thanks to the contributors on this vacuum hose hookup... couple of
good posts in the archives cleared that up.

How about the hose for the thermostatic vacuum valve on the air
cleaner... the one that regulates the pre-heat air off the head. Where's
that sucker supposed to go? As usual, your experience is appreciated.

My two cents on the Jalousie thread... I always called them Louvered
Windows before joining the list... still works for me. But I kind of
like Jealousy Windows... I knew what he meant, but you could use it to
communicate Jalousie Envy. :)

Thanks in advance for help on the Air Cleaner hose,

Paul
