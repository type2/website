Hi, Steve,

You wrote:

and 

&gt; Also applicable to the sagging rear end question is the different rear
&gt; torsion bars that VW used.  Did you know that the panels and Westies got
&gt; heavier-duty torsion bars in the rear than the passenger vans??  My
&gt; passenger van was sagging severely, but my Westies have all been quite
&gt; level!  Something to consider next time you see a Westy in a junk yard!

I had to replace my torsion bars a few years ago and it took me a lot 
of phone calls, two deliveries of the wrong bars and a fast trip to 
Sydney (3 hours away) to make sure I got the correct bars for my 
passenger bus. I could get as many green painted heavy duty bars 
as I liked but the red painted passenger bus bars were harder to come 
by. I reasoned that staying with the red bars for a bus would be 
better because the heavier bars might firm up the ride too much. If VW 
wanted the bus to have a firmer ride, they would have fitted green 
bars, right?

My present passenger bus has a sagging rear so that's a job for the 
summer. I wonder if I'll be able to get any red bars if I need them?

Ian
