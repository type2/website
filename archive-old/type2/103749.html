Subject: Re: [T2] Bus wrapping

I read an article last year about a number of companies that do the vinyl
application thing.  I've even seen a independent contractor (non-Ford) at
the Ford dealership applying vinyl decals to new police cruisers.  The
entire &quot;paint&quot; scheme was really just the vinyl appliquis.

A web search might turn up a few vendors... hmm...

Since Giacomo is going to be our primary business vehicle, I might look into
having this done instead of sign painting or magnetic signs.  Thanks for the
idea, Jim.
