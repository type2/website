Subject: Just ordered an engine - MSHP - Stage II

Volks,

Well, I had a little extra cash so I sprung for the big box :-)  A 2.2
liter Mark Stephens Stage II!  Conversations I have had with various and
sundry people convinced me that the larger engine was a good idea in the
larger van ('80 Westy).  I am obviously not interested in drag racing
(fantasies occur to me, but... really ;-)  I want an engine that will last
and last and last, and will move the bus at a decent rate across the US
this coming June.

During the ordering process, a couple questions
came up and I want to present them for general discussion: 

Their preferred compression ratio is 8:1, which struck me as high.  I am
tend to feed my bus regular (87 r+m/2 octane) and I'd like to continue to
do so, so I asked them to jack the compression down closer to stock
(7.5:1).  Comments?  Should I settle for a life in the mid-grade octane
lane?  go lower if I want the engine to last?  I know we discussed octane
at length and the list wisdom (and my experience) is that 87 is fine, but
to what CR?

I asked for painted cylinders.  Per the sermons, this struck me as a good
idea and they will do that, no charge.

Their ad says that the 2.2 will run on the stock FI, OK... but when you
call it means &quot;with a bit of tweaking on the AFM mix screw&quot;.  Has anyone
gone to the bigger engine and done the tweaking?  Was the stock FI up to
it? 

Is there anyone else who has gone this route?  Are you happy?

What questions/assembly options have I forgotten?

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
