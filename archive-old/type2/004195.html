Wow that is an interesting website,,
http://www.espar_dot_com/htm/specials/bn2bn4.htm
It has a dealer that is &quot;recommended for  full service, spare parts, and
technical advice:&quot;
all i can say is be very careful of who your dealing with,,,
VERY careful , would be my exact words!  especially if it involves YOUR
money and Trusting someone!
just a personal experience that many others seem to have had also.... their
&quot;business&quot; policies seem to be very unfair to say the least!
Sorry,, i couldn't resist , I don't like to say anything that is not
positive about VW repair and sevice

&gt;&gt;for this heater?

&gt;Go to URL: http://www.espar_dot_com/htm/specials/bn2bn4.htm
&gt;
&gt;I was surprised to read there &quot;Espar Products Inc. is able to send
&gt;copies of the original BN2 or BN4 manuals&quot;.
