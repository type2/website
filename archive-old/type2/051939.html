Subject: Re: [T2] Friday Bus Poll

[...]  My 71 Westy is probably closer to (A) than any other of your 
choices.  Last year I had a very good paint job done, including removal 
of nearly everything prior to painting. The canvas is new, and I've put 
in many new interior parts. I need new upholstry in the rear, but the 
front seats I have redone.  The sink/icebox is from a 72, so the &quot;wood&quot; 
grain does not match.  I have a 71 sink/icebox  which I am restoring.  
So, it looks real good, and all the rubber is fresh.  The engine is 
stock and has about 50K on it, and the overall machanical condition is 
excellent.  It is ready to go anywhere at any time.  It lives outdoors 
in my driveway, under cover - but wishes it had an indoor spot.

&gt; something all of you can reply to, even those lurkers
&gt; out there :)  the poll question is:
&gt; What condition is your bus in?   I am just curious as
&gt; to how many out there are driving restored beauties
&gt; down to rusty drivers.  so what kind of bus do you
&gt; drive?
&gt; 
&gt; A)Restored Example
&gt; 
&gt; B)Very Nice (not quite restored but very clean or
&gt; original nice condition)
&gt; 
&gt; C)Daily Driver (clean but has a door ding here and
&gt; there or just a touch of rust)
&gt; 
&gt; D)Beater (its rusty, dented, combo of both, people
&gt; look at you funny when they see its not abandoned-well
&gt; maybe not quite that bad:)
&gt;
