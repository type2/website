Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for a Frantz oil filter unit

&gt;Does anyone have an unused Frantz oil filter on any of thier parts buses?

I have 'being used' (except my bus is in the garage for the winter, until I
cure the smoking after I finish the house...) Frantz toilet paper roll
filter on my 71.  Judging from the color of the oil when I change it, it
works really well.  But you're left with an oil soaked roll of toilet paper
when you're done.  Do you really want to deal with that?  The recycling guys
roll their eyes at me when I take it in, and my neighbor didn't talk to me
for a month after I let it burn in the back yard for three days.

Another listee once asked me for it, and pending some engine work I said he
could have it (are you still out there?  I can't remember who it was.  You
said your dad's bus had one way back when).  But under the circumstances of
un-use, I'd be willing to demount it (excellent condition, they used good
materials) in exchange for a spin on model, keeping the hoses where they
are.

Anyone (the original listee gets first dibs) interested in a swap?
