Subject: sucked a valve?

Thanks all for the replies on troubleshooting options. After
I finish this major project that brings in the income that
makes me able to afford this addiction of mine (VWs - I'm
sure you understand :-), I'll advise what I find... and I'm
sure I'll have more questions, as this is my first FI
engine.

I appreciate your voices of experience and encouragement to
keep a cool head (pun intended) in the process of
resurrecting this old girl.

Regards,

Joe
