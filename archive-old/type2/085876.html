Subject: Tail Light Installation - Help!!!

Ok, I've got some brand new tail light assemblies (housing, seal, &amp; =
lens) and I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get these =
installed.  There must be some kind of trick that I'm missing but I =
can't seem to keep the housing installed in the groove in the rubber =
seal and at the same time install the seal into the hole in the body (or =
vice versa, install seal into body and then try to install housing into =
its groove). =20

Someone please help me before I go nuts (been trying for 2 hours with no =
success).
