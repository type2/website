Subject: Wiper motor blowing fuses

I swear all I did was change the blades.

The old ones were shot so had little resistance, but since changed have
blown fuses in a short time (seconds). ANY ideas?? Was really looking
forward to Everybus this weekend, but is supposed to rain some and really
need wipers! What do I check?

Any help appreciated in advance.
