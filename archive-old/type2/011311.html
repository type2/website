In our Dormobile (Toaster) we use a vented (2&quot; hole through both inner and
outer floors) box/seat behind the driver's  seat to store our propane
bottle. A fixed but flexible armoured hose goes to the cooker which is under
the passenger front seat.
I believe Heath Robinson's uncle designed the whole shebang. You have got to
see it to understand. Neat features including the gas tap (one of three)
having to be in the off position before the cooker can fold away and a heat
shield and folding bench &quot;hot top&quot; behind the passengers seat back.
