Subject: Re: [T2] Denver?

 It seems there's a medium chance I'll be getting transferred there in
 the next year, leaving behind my beloved Southern California. :(


There is (or at least there was) this great place in Englewood (just
south of denver) on Broadway that had a TON of buses.  The guy has
painted at least one with Dr. Suess characters.  It was always fun to
see that one driving around town.  It's been a little over a year
since I moved away and I can't remember the name of the place, but
I'll email some family and see if they can find out for me.
