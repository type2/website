Subject: A bike rack

After over a year of procrastinating, I have finally fabricated a bike 
rack for Peregrine and attached it. Since it was cheap, seems to be 
effective, and doesn't look half bad, I am going to write out the 
directions here. But before I do, understand that the rack requires that 
two 1/2 inch holes be drilled through the rear hatch sheet metal. Since 
Peregrine is no show bus, that didn't bother me too much. But I rather 
think I would do it in any case, since is solves so many of the problems 
of installing a rack while creating just the two holes.

I had the kind of inverted-U bike rack, made of tubular steel, that was 
common back when Steely Dan had a new record out every year. I removed 
the hook/bracket pieces and pitched the rest of the rack. Cost was $10 at 
a thrift store.

The hook/bracket pieces were held on to the tubing with 1/2&quot; diameter 
bolts. So the first thing was to drill holes for the bolts in the sheet 
metal. Remove the inside panel, measure about 16&quot; apart and centered, and 
drill about 1&quot; below the bottom of the belt line. (Usually deal: start 
with 1/8&quot; bit and redrill with progressively larger bits.)

Next, the wooden frame. The frame is there to provide spacers for the 
bolts, and to prevent the torque from the loaded hooks from distorting 
the sheet metal. 

The frame looks about like this:

                   ------------------------------------------
                   |     || o                      o ||     |
                   ----- ||--------------------------||------
                         ||                          ||
                         ||                          ||
                         ||                          ||
                         ||                          ||
                        ||||                        ||||
                        ||||                        ||||
                        

It is made entirely of 1&quot;X2&quot; oak. The top piece is 24 inches; the 
uprights are 10-3/4&quot;, and the little pads at the bottom are 3&quot;. The hooks 
bolt through the holes (indicated). The uprights act as stiff springs to 
absorb the torque, and attached to the top from behind with countersunk 
wood screws. The pads are also attached in the same way to the bottoms of 
the uprights, but are not attached to the hatch. The simply ride on the 
edge of the hatch, where the hatch frame provides the necessary stiffness. 
Other points: varnish the frame, then glue rubber on the parts that touch the hatch (standard 
bicycle tire tube cut for rubber). Also, a plate of steel 2&quot;X3&quot; on the 
inside of the hatch spreads the crimping power of the nut, so that the 
holes will not deform.

I currently have one very clunky old steel bicycle hanging on it now; I 
think it would easily hold two lightweight bikes. It is fairly stiff when 
evenly loaded, but oscillates like the old Tacoma Narrows bridge if 
rocked side to side. Still, it seems to work just fine. Total cost to me: 
$14.00.

Too early to say Merry Christmas and all that, but 'tis the season.
