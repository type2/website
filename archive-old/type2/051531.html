Subject: [T2] 70 sink/icebox removal help

Hi everyone,

I'm having some trouble with the removal of my sink unit.  More
to the point, the vent tube that goes through the roof of the bus.
I thought it just unscrewed, but now I think it might be cemented
together at the junction underneath the sink top.

Could someone who has done this give me some tips?

There also looks to be the same problem with the curved drain 
piece that protrudes from underneath the bus. PVC pipe cemented
together.  What breaks this bond?

FYI I'm doing this so that I can remove the Z-bed so that I can 
remove the westy wood driver side panel so that I can treat it
with a water proofer and coat with polyurethane.  I've done this
to several other panels and so far the results are encouraging.
No restoring, just trying to prevent more damage.

Derek
70 Westy
