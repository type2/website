This is a fairly common phenomenon.  Radial tires' belts will sometimes
acquire a &quot;set&quot;, for no apparent reason, and no amount of alignment fiddling
will resolve the &quot;pull&quot;.

Most of the time swapping front tires from side to side will take care of
the &quot;pull&quot;, but in some situations there's nothing to do but scrap the
offending tire and start fresh.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt; But another thing it could be is that one of your tyres is distorted. &lt;&lt;
