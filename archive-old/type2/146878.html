Subject: Re: [T2] Valve Adjustment Redux (Solved)

Gave up and took it into the shop, needed to have a fuel-injector stud
re-threaded anyhow.  Mechanic adjusted one cylinder's valves and said &quot;I
could swear these are hydraulic&quot;.  Hmm.. that would explain the
squishiness now, wouldn't it?

Called my wife, and she dug through the folder of receipts we inherited
with the bus.  Sure 'nuf, there's a small generic hand-written receipt
from 1997.  &quot;Hydraulic lifters - $76.00&quot;.

The kicker was that I had adjusted the valves so far wrong, he didn't
think the bus would've run at all if they weren't hydraulic.  'course,
if they weren't hydraulic, I wouldn't have set them wrong in the first
place...

Sometimes it pays to pay someone who knows what they're doing.

&gt; I'm redoing my valve adjustment ('76 Westy, 2.0L, non-cali), I think I 
&gt; may have done something wrong the first time.  But I just realized an 
&gt; assumption I made the first time may be incorrect...
&gt; 
&gt; Now, some of my valves seem to behave differently than others.  There 
&gt; are two behaviors as I cycle around the cylinders:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  I push on the rocker lightly with my thumb, it &quot;clicks&quot; open just a 
&gt; little bit, and stays open when I remove my thumb.  Then I can measure 
&gt; with the feeler at my leisure.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  I push on the rocker really hard, and it &quot;springs&quot; open, quite a 
&gt; lot.  When I let go, it springs shut again.  Thus, I have to maintain 
&gt; pressure on the rocker with one hand, and use the feeler with the other.
&gt; 
&gt; The Bentley manual doesn't even mention pushing on the rocker.  Which 
&gt; should it be, should the valve stay open or spring shut?  I'm afraid I'm 
&gt; pushing the rocker too hard and thus tightening down the screw too much.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; -Charles
