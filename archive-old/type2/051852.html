Steve,
Nice shop here in Lake Havasu City AZ. It is called Old Volks Home.  It is 
run by a guy named Ronnie, and he has some good prices, and knows his VW's.

The web page is type2parts_dot_com and I belive the address is on the bottom of 
the page.

Mike

&gt;I'm going to Anaheim to pick up my tranny from Rancho and then over to 
&gt;Phoenix to find some sunshine and leach off my brother for a few days.  My 
&gt;question, is there some FLAPS in either of these places or in between 
&gt;where I could finds some misc Type 2 and vanagon parts like rear motor 
&gt;mounts etc at a reasonable price?
