&gt;Hiya everyone
&gt;
&gt;        I have a 71 bus and when i am changing gears the clutch grabs or
&gt;whatever and vibrates the car. Does anyone know what is causeing this. I
&gt;have heard it could be the flywheel a pressure plate or worn clutch. Is
&gt;there any way to test it and know for sure.

Phil,

If this is happening primarily going into first gear I'd be you have an oily
clutch (probable cause is the main oil seal on the front of the engine or
the transmission input shaft seal--you can tell what's leaking by smelling
the residue--mmmmm greasy residue..).  If this is the case, when you do
replace your seal(s) and clutch, make sure you check the crankshaft endplay
as excessive endplay is one cause of the premature demise of the main oil seal.
