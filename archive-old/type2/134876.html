I've done it this way. I can't imagine why I would want to jack the bus up
to do it. Perhaps I just hate jacking the bus up.

You do need to roll the bus though as you can't get those top bolts back in.
Got them off without moving it though.

Resetting the chocks and carefully rolling the bus works, too.
(Remember, Don's jack and jackstands have it out for him).


&gt; Ok, I'm laughing now...sort of.  You *will* need to lift the bus to
&gt; be able to turn the wheels a little in order to get to the bolts
&gt; better.
