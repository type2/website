Subject: Re: [T2] Anonymous threatening letters left on my bus...
  Advice?

Let me start by saying, I hate Homeowner Associations.

At least here in Miami, condo associations take
extreme measures when it comes to eyesores.

I had a 63 Ghia which was an eyesore, so I bought a
car cover for it so no one would see it, apparently
that wasnt enough and I arrived home to find my car
was
about to be towed!!

I would be careful, u may get home and find your bus
isnt there or even worse subject to vandalism by your
pissed off neighbors. I would write a letter to the 
association. I would make arrangements to move the bus

elsewhere for a while or at least make it the most 
asthetically pleasing u can.

Right now my 73 camper is over at my parents, in the
back yard where no one can see its bright orange,
rusted coat.
