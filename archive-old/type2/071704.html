Subject:  [T2] Re: Vanagon engine into (79) Bay

Rick

I'm curious.  Why is it so hard to put a 80 vanagon engine in a &quot;79 bay.

They both use 071 heads so the heater boxes should be 
interchangeable.  The only thing I can see that is at all hard is to 
drill out the bay engine mounts so they take a 12mm bolt.  Either 
plug the 79 dip stick fitting on the filler pipe or the 80 dip stick 
pipe hole on the case.

Please correct me if I'm not seeing something.

Steve

&gt;Good luck!!

&gt;This a very time consuming and expensive project to do it correctly.  You
would be many hours, dollars and headaches ahead if you just sold the
Vanagon and bought a type 4 engine.&lt;


&gt;I have a 1980 Vanagon engine I'd like to install a in my 1979 Westy.

Questions I have are,  Can this easily be done? Are there any problems or
things I should look out for?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance
