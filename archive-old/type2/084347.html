Subject: Re: [T2] New Clutch, or What?

Hmm- adjustor nut is screwed all the way in?  Usually as disk lining
wears the adjustor must be LOOSENED to let the plate move farther
against the disk.  However, if cable stretches (wears, or broke some
cable strands), play increased and you'd be prompted to tighten the
adjustor.  As I posted privately, chirring or squealing noises on
letting the clutch out could mean some improper rubbing of disk against
the flywheel or the pressure plate as the plate squishes down onto the
disk.  In my case, I had the lining come off the pressure plate side and
caked all over the edges, prompting it to act as if clutch were let out
at intermittant times even when fully depressed.  Eventually the rivets
were rubbing on the plate, causing a terrible &quot;chirring&quot; noise and I
yanked the clutch.  Got a LUK kit from Bus Depot and it shifts like
butter now.

&gt; I'm pretty sure I need a new clutch.  Why?  The adjuster nut on the clutch cable is screwed all the way in and can't be adjusted any more.  So, am I correct that its just time for a new clutch?
