Subject: Re:  pictures of SO-69-5 interior needed

&gt;in my new Adventurewagen...the interior is a
SO-69-5.  Does anyone have pictures of 
this interior?  Does someone have the sink unit
they want to sell me?

That is a fairly rare interior that wasn't sold
or wasn't sold much in the US.  I think Euro
delivery vehicles made it here with the interior.
  But it is also very similar to the 74-75 style
westy interior so you could probably use the sink
out of one of those.  I'm not sure if the wood
color will match.
