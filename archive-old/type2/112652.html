&gt;
&gt; There are some good things that might shake out of this. What if VWoA
&gt; working with an independent licensed manufacturer started making NEW T-IV
&gt; heads meeting VWoA specs??

Wrong. If you want to market a new part you have to go to VWAG. Its this nuance that frustrated vendors for so long in trying to get licensed for their products. VWoA kept
stonewalling about how to become licensed while moving full speed ahead with enforcement. My feeling is that, while this arrangement may seem logical (at least to them), it doesn't
work well in practice because the poor quality of the products that do get licensed is not monitored by either VWAG or VWoA. So, I've started collecting original hubcaps because the
repro is such crap.
