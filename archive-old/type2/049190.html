I don't know about dash-mounted/permanently installed vacuum gauges, but my
ancient combination vacuum gauge/fuel pressure gauge came with a steel
fitting with a very small aperture to be used in the vacuum mode.

This is a ~5&quot; diameter hand-held/clamp-mounted instrument intended for
analysis and tune-up use.  That fitting works like a charm, giving steady
readings even on 2-cylinder engines.

&gt;&gt;  One problem I've had is smoothing out the pulses in the vacuum.  If you
hook the gauge directly to vacuum, the needle will vibrate severly.  I
&quot;fixed&quot; this by putting a small metal tube inline with the vacuum hose and
pinching it with a vice-grips until the pulses smooth out.  &lt;&lt;
