  Steve,
     My VW Troubleshooting guide (nice flow charts-US 42-00-5954-1) lists
the following:   (flow to next number if problem still exists)
1. Throttle valve not closing (acc cable tight, shaft sticks, bent
plate)-(possible since you had it out....press it with thumb to check!)
2. Idle speed adjustment off...works sort of with screww turned in fully=
aux. air regulator not closing?  Pinch hose (block) between aux air reg and
rubber elbow .  If idle drops, test aux air reg....pull off connector and
test for voltage across  connector when engine is running.  If yes, replace
aux air reg.  If no, then :
3.  Check for dead wire to 88c term of double relay or term 34 of control unit.
4. If idle speed didn't drop with pinch test, decel valve may not be
closing- block its hose to intake air distr....if it drops, defective decel
valve.  If idle speed does not drop:
5.  Fuel pressure too high  (28+-2.8psi is correct)  If high, hose between
intake air distr. may be leaking or off; or pressure reg. bad.  If not high:
6. Excessive ignition advance....is distributor sticking- use timing light.
