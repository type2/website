hey everybody,
in the ongoing saga of my bus forcing me to learn how
to fix everything on it, she is forcing me to learn
again.   seeing in the past 6 months ive replaced the
heads, pistons and sleaves, why not something else.  
well it was running like a dream and i had to follow
my wife to drop off our Jeep to get the AC checked.  
dropped it off and were heading home, no
problems....then out of no where a sudden clunking
sound starts, i let off the gas, oil light on, and
immediately shut down.    so i get out, it doesnt seem
overly hot, it has oil, so i attempt to start back up.
  well it seems to me that lizzy has developed a nice
rod knock.  how nice.   so i got it towed home and
will probably yank the motor this weekend.   so my
question is when i start to dissassemble, what should
i be looking for?   what will tell me that a certain
rod is going, etc.   ive taken apart engines before,
but before they developed problems.   so its either
rebuild this one myself or AVP, ill have to wait and
see.   the weird part about the whole thing is that
the bus actually knew what was gonna happen.   when we
dropped the Jeep off to the mechanic who also happens
to be my VW mechanic, when we went to leave the bus
wouldnt start, just click and nothing.   it hasn't
done that in over a year.   weird how she knows
things.   at least Lizzy brought us to NY and back ok,
better to breakdown 8 miles from home instead of 1008.
