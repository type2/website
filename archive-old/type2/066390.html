Subject: Wiper Motor Gear/Shaft

Michael,
  My wiper motor suffered the same ailment that you posted about on Fri.
I tried fitting a steel pipe around the collar of the shaft hole and then
sawing the pipe only to the height of the collar.  This was with the 
intention of keeping the collar tigh around the shaft.  I then EPOXIED 
the serrated part of the shaft and put it in place, let it dry and 
PRESTO!  After the pain in the rear that I had to go through to 
re-connect the motor to the wiper assembly.  I push the wiper lever and..
...     NOTHING.  All I heard was the whine of the motor.  I then 
resorted to stripping a motor from a junked beetle.  When I got back to
my house and compared motors, I realized the wires were different. 
AHHHH!!!!
WILL THIS AGONY NEVER END??     
I finally took the gear/shaft assembly from the beetle motor and 
transplanted it.  Now my wipers work, but they don't park where they 
should.  They park vertically.  I'm dumbfounded, oh well, I guess its 
better than having to treat my winshield with rain-x.
