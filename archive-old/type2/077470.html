Subject: Re: [T2] speedo lube

Last time I measured them, the 80 is thicker then the 81. From back plate to
face. If memory serves me right.....80 was 45mm and 81 was 37mm [same as a bay].
Putting a 80 in a bay cluster [so you have a trip counter] would not light up at
night, the face blocked the light because it sits flush with the housing.



&gt; Al, is the 80 and 81 speedo the same? If so I could send you the one out of
&gt; my 81. It works and the od has 54766.2 miles and it's free, except shipping.
