Subject: Re: [T2] Tires

Hi George,

I have a set of four 185/R14C Hankook's on my 1976 Westy.  I can 
not recommend them highly enough.  Prior to buying these, I had 
over-sized tires that looked cool but rode terribly.  I have 
driven round trip from Southern Illinois to Southern Oregon 
three times on the Hankooks and they are flawless.  The bus is 
stable (not as prone to wind sway), it stops well and it rides 
well.  It is even relatively quiet (RELATIVELY).  As an added 
bonus, they wear extremely well.

Jeff
