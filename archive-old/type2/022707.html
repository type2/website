Sean suggested:
&gt;&gt; Put a vacuum gauge on that sucker and see what you've got. &lt;&lt;

I use a vacuum gauge in my 73 Bronco (302) and it's very useful.  Is anyone
here using a dash-mount vac gauge in their stock bus.  I have a 68 with
rebuilt 30/31 with two unused vac ports ABOVE the throttle plate (no good
for a real-time vac gauge) but don't see a port on the intake manifold or in
the base plate of the carb.  Would the later-year booster hose mentioned
earlier this week be a good candidate for this application?
