Hello all! My names Chris and I'm now the proud owner of two '77 VW Campers.
One is a Campmobile (two-tone brown and white) and the other is a conversion
by a place in Vancouver, WA.  These are my first vehicles (only the Campmobile
runs at this time, I'm going to use IT to help me get the other one restored)
and I'm going to be learning how to drive a manual on the Campmobile.  I've been
on the list for a while now, and I peruse the type2 web site daily.  I recall
having read either a Sermon or another archive posting about DRIVING the VW
Bug and Bus, which I can't locate anymore! Specifically it gave instructions on
what speeds to shift at, how to avoid lugging, and other useful tips.  Since I'm
pretty new to driving in general (I'm 21, just got my license this year) and
VERY new to manuals (I've sortof driven one around a parking lot once, I know
the basic mechanics involved) this file would be immeasurably helpful to me now.
If anyone knows where this is (or wants to re-impart the info!) I would be
extremely grateful.  Thanks ever so much, you're a great bunch of people!
