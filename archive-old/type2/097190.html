Subject: RE: [VB] BEWARE... crank gears

When I put the gears on the crank for my 36hp okrasa motor I'm in the middle
of building (not for the double cab but for the ghia), I too didn't get the
gear slid down in place the first time out...  So, I simply got out my gear
puller and pulled it off and tried again.  This time however, I got a 6 inch
piece of pipe about 2&quot; in diameter, heated up the gear real well, and then
used that pipe and a hammer to encourage the gear on... but it didnt need
any real hammering, just a few gentle taps to push it down quickly before it
cooled....

unable to get the cam gear all the way snugged before it cooled down
