Subject: Re: [Fw: Type 4 cam wear]

Theories:
As the cam (and lifter)wears throught the 'surface hardening' they both will
deliver more and more steel fragments into the crankcase.

As well as this, with less lift you may start running hotter and with less
power.

Wilson is right - the square spot means replace it.

European Motorworks in Hawthorne, CA will sell you a good reground hyd lift
cam for about 40 bucks.

I'm breaking one in right now with reground lifters and have seen no metal in
my two oil changes so far.

&gt; &gt;looks like the one in Tom Wilsons book on page 97.
&gt; &gt;As far as I understand after its worn this far its though
&gt; &gt;the hardened surface and it will wear faster now right?
