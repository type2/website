Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Painting / Cleaning the Undercarriage

      Rustoleum rusty metal primer still contains fish oil (go to 
rustoleum_dot_com and check the faq).  I think that all the Rustoleum line used 
to have fish oil in it, but they changed some of their formulas recently.  I 
may catch hell for this because Rustoleum just seems to be out of favor 
these days, too many new paints I guess, but I love it.  I use the rusty 
metal primer on rusty spots after a wire brushing, and the clean metal 
primer (which I don't believe has fish oil) on any clean metal spots, and 
leave anything with good paint basically alone other than a quick run-over 
with a wire brush to promote adhesion.  I top coat all the scuffed paint, 
rusty metal primer, and clean metal primer with rustoleum gloss or satin 
black.  Gloss is easier to clean but the satin tends to look more correct as 
an undercoating.
     Rustoleum is a really soft but durable kind of paint.  It doesn't seem 
to chip very easily.  I've helped paint undercarriages with rustoleum that I 
know have held up over ten years and counting.  Nothing lasts forever, 
especially over rust, but so far so good.
    The main downside I see is that if you use Rustoleum your kind of 
committed to it.  I am pretty sure it would be less than easy to go back to 
a normal paint.  I don't think you could paint over it with a normal enamel 
and getting it all off would be less than fun.
