Subject: Any 83 or newer Buses in Seattle?

Is there a for sale post for Vanagons anywhere??I saw the one for type's
 I'm headed out to the rainbow gathering in Seattle on June 27 and would like 
to possibly find a 83 (Would possibly consider a 71 Westy so I could retire 
mine that has great parts on it) or newer (NO RUST!) Westy to drive back to 
NY. I need the heat!!!!!

Haven't had a chance to get out to my 71 to figure out he firing problem, 
when's it gonna stop raining?
