Hi all,

Thanks for all of the feedback over the weekend.. it appears that my dist
cap had some moisture in it, therefore my Riviera would not start.  I dried
it out and all was fine.

I have a continuing problem though.  I have a bad hot start problem.  I have
added the hot start relay, and it still happens if I drive for an hour or
more.

I think I will buy a new high quality starter and battery.  Can I get some
feedback as to what is a good long lasting starter I should purchase (and
the best place to get one)?

Thank you again.. this list is great,

Cheers
