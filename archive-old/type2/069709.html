Subject: EGR valves

        EGR stands for Exhaust Gas Recirculation. What that means
is that the EGR valve opens and exhast gas flows into  the intake
manifold and thus to the cylinders. Exhaust gas is mostly the
same as intake- 78% N2, but a lot of the 21% O2 is replaced with H20 
and CO2 from burning gasoline the last time it went through the
cylinder.

        The net effect is to decrease the ammount of combustable 
ingredients in the cylinder- like mixing rocks among the charcoal
in a bbq. 

        The result is less NOx, since NOx products are produced by
very high temperaures.

        That blue Bosch Fuel Injection book shows a neat graph of
NOx, CO and unburned hydrocarbons- run rich (cool) and you get
little NOx, but lots of CO and HC. Run lean and you get little
HC and CO, and lots of NOx. Lambda systems sense O2 in the exhaust
stream and lean the mixture until you get some O2 coming out,
but not huge amounts. The HC and CO that come out are cleaned up
by the catalyst. EGR cools the combustion chamber and gives lower NOx
without producing HC/CO that needs cleanup at the catalyst.

        I bought a new EGR for my Rabbit- the diaphram failed. $150
at the local import car FLAPS. They're realy easy to test: they
should be closed at idle and open as vaccuum is allowed to get
to them... so if your's works, you can put a hose and a vaccuum
pump or a hose and your lips to the thing and suck it open, which
should give you a drop in RPM at idle, from the dilution of
the mixture. If you have to keep sucking/pumping to keep it ON,
it probably had a bad diaphram.

        If the stock EGR isn't avalable, and you wanted function,
I expect the non-stock later model would work.
