Subject: Stuck Dizzy Whats the trick??

Alright so I have this 67 squareback engine (dual
carbs) in a 72 bus and i need to install a correct
distributor. The one on it is an 0 231 129 019 which
according to oldvolkshome_dot_com is for a 55 Beetle.
ANyway, condensor and points are dead in this one and
I can't get the d*mn distributor off of the engine. I
loosened the hold down clamp in BOTH places, I
twisted, pulled, pried, and cussed for about an hour
and i CAN'T GET IT OUT!! Is there some kind of trick
to getting a distributor off of a T3 engine?  ANyone
have any good tips for getting out a stuck dizzy? Can
anybody use this old beetle dizzy?
