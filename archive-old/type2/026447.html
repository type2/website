Subject: RE:  Engine Rebuild
Date: Mon, 16 Nov 1998 18:46:12 -0600

&gt;I am soon to attempt an engine rebuild of a 1776cc VW.  This is my 
&gt;first time rebuilding a motor and I am a little nervous.  Can anyone 
&gt;offer any advice or perhaps tools, books, etc. i may need to invest in.


The only special tools you'll need are:
-&gt; A 36mm (?) socket and a big breaker bar and a means of locking your
flywheel (either a tool or self-made method) to remove/install the gland
nut.
-&gt; piston ring compressor to install your new pistons/rings.
-&gt; Big syringe w/o needle (obtained from a veterinary) to cc your heads.
-&gt; BFS (big f###ing screwdriver) to remove the oil pressure and relief
piston plugs.
-&gt; Clutch allignment tool ($4.00 black plastic rod) to allign the clutch
when re-installing the flywheel.
-&gt; Torque wrench for damn-near every nut/bolt you put back on.
-&gt; Manual to tell you what order to do things in and how tight every
nut/bolt should be.

Other than those, I can't think of anything besides the normal variety
of sockets, wrenches, and screwdrivers needed for a rebuild.  That is
assuming, of course, that you will have a machine shop do all the case
and head machining work and that you already have a comprehensive tool
box with lots of sockets, wrenches, and screwdrivers.

A few things I did right on my last rebuild:
-&gt; Took my old crankshaft to the machine shop and asked the guy to
remove the gear from the end.
-&gt; Took my new crankshaft to the machine shop and asked the guy to
install the bearing and gear on the end.  Neither is necessary, but it
sure makes life easier!
-&gt; CC'ed my heads after getting them back from the machine shop so I
could install the appropriate shims for my target compression ratio.
-&gt; Cleaned the living sh#t out of my case after machine work was done.

A few things I did wrong (or in the wrong order) - just the biggies:
-&gt; Had my case cut for bigger pistons before having the thrust surface
checked (I'd have scrapped the case if I had known...
-&gt; Installed 2 of the rods upside down (what can I say?).
-&gt; Didn't clean the living sh#t out of my heads after machine work.
-&gt; Didn't fix the 6 little studs that hold the oil screen plate on - now
it leaks there.

But above all, get a book.  Muir's idiot guide will get you through
anything.  Bently is good for specifications, but short on how-to's.
Haynes is halfway in between.

Just my 2 cents worth.
