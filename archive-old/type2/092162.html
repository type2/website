Does this sound like the Rubber / plastic part of the connector cage -
Shift rod to Transmission?
I just emailed them to see.  That ought to be fairly easy to find. I
hope!

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; Two young men from WA state who are doing a tour of the west are in need of a VW part source/junkyard.  They
&gt; stopped by Vegas and crashed with my family for a couple of days.  They are between Salt Lake City and Boise now
&gt; and they are having some problems with their linkage.  As they described it to me, all the grommets that are supposed
&gt; to be between the &quot;cage&quot; and the transmission have worn out and are gone.  They were pretty sure they would make it
&gt; to Boise and a friend's house.  However, they would like to repair it before heading back to Washington.
