I have just completed several mod's to our 73 Semi-Westy and the handling
has been greatly improved....If you want to limit that side-to-side lean
when you run those back road curves - read on...

1. installed frt &amp; rear 3/4 inch sway bars - from So-Cal _at_ about $60 each -
you get new Poly bushings for the front bar, and complete attaching hardware
for the rear.  The frt. went on OK - it was fun trying to press on the new
poly bushings over the ends of the 3/4 inch bar - I put them into a bowl of
water and heated them in the microwave till they were warm through-out -
then just 'twist &amp; shout' as you force them onto the bar. The rear bar was
also 'fun' but only took a couple of hours - they tell you to attach the
ends first and then swing the bar up against the 'frame' member to locate
where to drill the u-bolt holes - this was a chore to do by one's self until
I cut a support pole to hold it in place -also, you have to grind away part
of the frame 'lip' to clear the bar - no problem if you have a small
grinder - make sure your hole marks are the same distance from the torque
tube area, or the sway bar won't be 'even' at the ends (they don't tell you
this).

2. Replaced the old, original steering gear with a rebuilt unit from KYMCO _at_
$150 plus core chg of $75...This operation took about two hours - and do not
even start this job until you beg, borrow, or liberate a Draglink puller...I
had to use a standard two tang puller and it was a real bitch...a friend
showed me the draglink puller later, and it  the cat's meow for this
job...anyway, pull off the draglink, remove the turn signal switch &amp; ww
wiper switch from the top of the str column, along with the two screws under
you floor mat that hold the lower column cover plate (you have to lift the
column enough to clear the gear's input shaft), remove the cross bolt &amp; nut
(13mm) from the top of the str gear, and finally remove the 4 gear/frame
attaching bolts...from below, push the str column up enough to wiggle out
the old str gear...you will note that there is a small round plastic plug in
the top of the str gear that allows you to fill the gear with lube - be sure
to check your new str gear to see if it's lubed before
installation!!!!...the install goes real fast as you are now are working
with a nice clean str gear, not that old greasy mess you took out!.._dot_use the
draglink nut to 'draw' the draglink back onto the spligns - and don't forget
to align the draglink with the mark on the end of the shaft with the 'L'
mark on the draglink (if you have LH steering).

3. I have 215/70R14  Firestone M+S, FR480 tires mounted on stock 73
wheels...they good with about 28psi or 31psi with a loaded bus...however, I
just 'promoted' a set of alum Mercedes wheels that have a 1 inch wider rim
width (I think they were off of a 380) - Mercedes uses 12mm wheel studs, and
our bus uses 14mm x 1.5 studs...I went to all of the trouble to get a 14mm
drill to open up the steel inserts in the alum wheels to fit my hubs, and
found the clearance was too tight...I then used a 9/16 inch bit to get the
clearance I needed after 'reaming the hole a bit...I had previously attached
my stock wheels with chrome 14 mm x 1.5 lug nuts, but had to use thin seat
adapters due to the seat angle of the chrome nuts not matching the stock
wheel tapered stud holes...on the new alum wheels, I wanted to eliminate the
'adapters' so I found a 60 degree taper bit to redo the seat angles on the
new wheels to match the chrome lugs...I guess I could have tried to find
some other chrome lugs to match the VW, but didn't have much luck...

Well let me tell everyone, the new sways bars, along with the precise
straight ahead steering gear (I think old str gear parts get worn in the
'straight ahead' mode) and the increased rim width for the tires I am using
made a 'new' Westy for us - 'OBBy', our Westy has entered another new
life! - and just in time, as we are heading south again next week for Bahia
Concepcion, below Mulege in Baja (I understand there's a surplus of Pacifico
Cerveza in the area and we are needed to do our part!)...also, I promise, no
'War &amp; Peace' length article when we get back this time! - maybe just a
'short' story of any really fun things involving OBBy when we get back...
