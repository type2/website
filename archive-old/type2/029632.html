Subject: Vanagon windshield needed, DC Area

Volks,

As a consequence of normal DC traffic stupidity and my storage of an
extension ladder in the '80, I am in need of a new windshield :-( Not
seriously or urgently, but for those of you who cruise the Baltimore/
Washington junkyard circuit (Barry, are you listening? :-) let me know if
you see a decent Vanagon windshield about, eh?

                           H Steven Dolan
