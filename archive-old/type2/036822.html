All,

These same knobs are avaialable at CampingWorld for a
whopping $1.50!!! And that includes the screw!

They come in gray or black.

&gt; I also bought the same round handles, but at my
&gt; local RV supply store here in 
&gt; Michigan.  Apparently they are a common handle, for
&gt; the many of the &quot;modern&quot; 
&gt; RV pop top campers, for their jalouisie windows,
&gt; too.
&gt; 
&gt; I believe they were only 5 bucks at most, and i'd be
&gt; willing to p/u a few and 
&gt; ship em out, for someone if they had a super hard
&gt; time finding them locally.  
&gt; They are nearly identical, same # of grooves, black
&gt; in color, and are a 
&gt; perfect fit. 
&gt; 
&gt; Another part I also bought at the same store was a
&gt; propane regulator, 
&gt; &quot;manchester&quot; brand, (oe) for my stock stove setup. 
&gt; My old one was leaking, 
&gt; and although this one looks different, it fits and
&gt; works fine, _at_ about 25 
&gt; bucks.
