depends on your definition of easy!
You'll need some dual port heads, the end castings for the heads, the center 
manifold and apropriate gaskets
When I got my '70 it needed new heads so got a pair of rebuild duals, grabbed 
the end castings from the wrecker and had the manifold laying around. So the 
answer to your question, not really a big deal to do.\
