Subject: Heloise saye : no water, please

Hint from Heloise:


Are you gettin water in the front when it rains and you are parked??

OK, then park it facing UP a small incline, if possible.  When it rains, the 
water [when parked, of course] will drain out the back gutter drain holes, 
and NOT out the front section, over the windshield seals . . . .

Barry [aka Heloise] sends


[Say 'thank you' ]
