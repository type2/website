actually lengthening the head temp gage's wires with anything but the proper thermocouple wire will make it worthless most likely as it derives the temperature from the cold junction of 2 different metals,  copper/constantine (red/blue type T) being the most common in my line of work.  not a big deal though, go to a geek store and get as much of the proper thermocouple wire that you need and twist the wires together then solder them and shrink wrap over them.

Opinions:  Theoretically, lengthining the wire for the 
head temp sensor
could throw the reading off, but, the signal is a 
millivolt signal that
varies in relation to temperature.  The current 
involved is minute, so, 8 or
10 feet of 16 AWG wire (4.18 ohms per 1000 ft _at_ 25 deg 
C, or .0418 ohms for
the additional 10 feet of wire, per the Okonite wire 
and cable data book) is
unlikely to make a significant difference in the 
temperature reading.
Anyway, what we're really interested in is comparing 
our present operating
temperature with some normal baseline value, so who 
cares if guage
calibration is a little off, as long as it's 
consistent.
