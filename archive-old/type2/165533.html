Subject: Re: [T2] Missiles and guns failed - switching to banging with 
  head...

&gt; Thanks for the epat-on-the-back. But like I said, I still think that the
&gt; steering is going to be sloppy due to the dead spots in the steering box.
&gt; For all I know, the steering box has been the culprit all along.

Before you get all panicky, first make sure that the box is centered
properly.  All steering boxes are sloppy when off-center, but the caster
of the steering system stops them from wobbling.

Also, check the joints in the drag link between the box and the swing
lever.  I played all sorts of games trying to get play out of the steering
before I realized that the drag link was bad.

George
