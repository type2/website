We were able to &quot;jumper&quot; the fuel pump (at the double relay) and the
pump was running, but could not get the engine to fire (except with
starting fluid).  I have not tried the flapper at the AFM ....



I am going to check the connection for the white wire at the coil - it
may have seen better days if I remember right.  I will also check all
the vacuum hose connections as was suggested (brake booster, etc.).
Anything else that could be suspect?



Thanks.



Terry

Have you tried activating the flap in the AFM by hand to see if it
triggers the fuel pump? You will be able to hear it fine. I just had
this same problem.
