Subject: Subject: 72 rear bumper, anyone?

If you didn't know you can widen your years that a rear bumper would fit
from 68-72, on our 72's it's the bumper brackets that are one year only. So
if you still have your bumper mounted now you would just exchange your
mounts.

I did see a 72 at the Picasso Moon camp out that had a 73- bumper on it, I
meant to ask how easy it was to mount and if he did modification's, it
looked good but  I never got a chance to chat with the owner.

Hope you find a good one as I have looked for both front and rear with no
luck!

Meredith
