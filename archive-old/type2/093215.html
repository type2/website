&gt;I have a '74 1800 engine that I am installing with the dual solex 34pict

&gt;not have a cutoff valve but I suspect that it is supposed to.  The spot where
&gt;it should be has what looks like a carb jet installed.  Am I correct in
&gt;thinking that this is some p.o.'s jury rigging?

The jet you're seeing is similar to the cutoff solenoid (which has a 
similar jet in the end of it) minus the cutoff function.  I like the plain 
jets better because they are RELIABLE.  :)  If I have to prevent engine 
run-on by another method (like releasing the clutch as soon as I shut off 
the key) then so be it.  You might try and find another jet to replace the 
cutoff in the left carb too.  Less wires, less worries.
