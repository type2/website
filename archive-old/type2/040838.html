Subject: GL 4 Tranny Oil

&gt;Has anyone found any GL4 in any of the national stores. I am having a &gt;hard
&gt;time finding it. Can I use a synthetic that is GL5 rated?

&gt;Matt

I know we've had this conversation a few times, but what tranny oil &quot;BRAND&quot; 
do you all use.  I found a GL 4 at GI Joe's in Oregon but I've never heard 
of the brand, and the store isn't a huge chain either.

does it really matter as long as its GL4?  Do we want High Performance GL4?
