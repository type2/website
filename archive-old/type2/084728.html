&gt;I take 4th down to 40, but the other thresholds are
&gt;about the same.

At 40mph in 4th a 76-up bus will be turning only about 2200rpm and a 72-75 
bus will be at 2500rpm.  Way too low for heavy-throttle hillpulling IMO.  I 
would recommend that you guys shift a bit sooner to keep your cylinder 
heads from getting hot.  In my '73 I downshift at between 50 and 45 
depending on conditions, and like others I drop down about 5mph to get to 
my sustained 3rd gear pulling speed of 40-45mph.  If I had a '76 or later 
bus I would raise those ranges by 5mph.

Getting gauges (CHT and tach in this case) makes some things very obvious.
