Subject: Sudden loss of Door trigger Function

G'day Neale,
As best I can remember from when I had my doors apart ('77 bus) the outside
door handle simply pushes against a plate inside the door which operates the
same mechanism as the inside handle. They are pretty robust, and if it's
working from the inside there can't be too much wrong. As you suggest, it's
more likely something has come loose. The Bentley should show all the mount
bolts for the door handle and the latch mechanism (which is one assembly), and
I'd check they're tight first. I have also seen it on old corroded out side
handles, the corrosion can stop the handle getting full travel, and the
sticking you mention. I tried freeing up an old one with out luck, so I ended
up getting a good second hand one instead.
If you still have problems, let me know.
Richard,
Brisbane Australia
