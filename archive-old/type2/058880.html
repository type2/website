Subject: Re: Disappearing Exhaust Bolts

I just finished delaing with this same problem.  I bought an EMPI
exhaust (header/muffler) from the local VW Flaps.  I installed in using
the provided gaskets and hardward.  After about 1 or 2 weeks, I noticed
the exhaust noise was back.  I checked it, and found only ONE bolt
holdeing the header to the heat exchanger (1 bolt there, 5 missing).
Well, I bought some new bolts and some high temp sealer (RTV type
product).  I removed what remained of the gaskets, and put on the RTV
sealer, and reattached the header.  That fixed that problem, but then
the bolts for the header to the muffler started to disappear.  I did the
same fix, and to date, have had no further problems.
     I don't know for sure, but I believe the gaskets that were provided
with the muffler are just no good.  After a very short time, they fail,
which allows the exhaust to leak out, causing more of the gasked
material to go away.  Once enough of the gasked material is gone, then
the bolts are no longer in tension, so they work themselves loose, and
fall out.
     I would recommend using only metal gaskets between the header and
the heat exchangers.  This is what VW used when they replaced my heat
exchangers in the late, great, free heat exchanger replacment program
(if you want more info on that, check the archives, BTW, it's over, no
more free heat exchangers).  If you don't have metal gaskets, the high
temp RTV sealer seems to work great.  I don't know if it would hold up
to direct contact with the head but I have had about a month of trouble
free exhaust system so far.  Only time will tell.
