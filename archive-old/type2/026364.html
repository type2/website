	I will second on the rear wheel bearing pack.  My bus was driven
through some deep water before I acquired her, and when I pulled the rear
drums, the stub axles looked terrible.  Grease your splines!  Speaking of
splines, is there anyone nearby(near Sacramento) that has a spare stub?  I
pulled one from the wrecker awhile ago, and it took me hours by myself.  I
need one that looks really good, since the other one looks great.  I'm sure
you guys understand. :^)  Thank you all.

	Eron


Isaiah, David:
And either change the lube in the transaxle or drive the thing long enough
(50
to 100 miles!) to boil out the water that may have come into the transaxle
thru the vent hole on the top.
A while back I had the opportunity to disassemble a 79 trans that had been
in
a flood. Sure enough the needle bearing on the end of the pinion was rusty/
ruined! Driving this transaxle a few hundred miles would surely have ruined
the whole thing.
