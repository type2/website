Subject: [T2] Trash into oil

ooo crap, I gotta get on the soapbox

As a person who considers himself a practical environmentalist, I know this
is a sensitive subject. But what I feel we're failing to realize here is
everyone is always so darned black and white on this subject and you can't
be.

&quot;If you drive an SUV you're satan&quot;

&quot;The only way to save the environment is is walk&quot;

&quot;You can't be for the environment and drive an old car&quot;

I think what Benoit and others who are &quot;pro-environment&quot; are trying to say
is that it's an unfortunate occurance that America has become so SUV crazy.
SUVs are a major target, not because of their size, but the fact that, as
someone alluded to here earlier, they only have to meet Truck emission
requirements, not car emissions so they pollute a lot more than a car ever
will, even if the car weighed as much as the SUV. Of course, this isn't the
fault of the SUV owners, rather the car companies trying to eek out as much
profit as they can.

Now on the pro-SUV side, there is no arguing that a bigger car is safer,
however I would say that if you're concerned about perishing in a car
accident, don't drive! One of my cars is a Fiat X1/9 which was the smallest
car in the US market for a few years in the 80s. The darned thing is so
small I can actually drive under a tractor trailer and most toll gates! Now
I've seen some of these cars get hit head on by trucks and the driver walks
away. And this is a car with no air bags or major safety systems. But again
your chances are higher to survive something if you're driving a Lincoln
Navigator and you wack into a wall, but don't try to make any hasty swerving
motions to avoid something in the road, you have a higher chance of tipping
over (but not as high as if you're in one of our Buses!)

As for electric/hybrid cars... to be honest I think the jury is still out on
those. I mean on the surface they seem fantastic but in actuality the
battery pack needs to be replaced at about 75K miles and Honda and Toyota
have been slow to release costs, but I hear that it's about 3K to replace
the pack. And the batteries are lead/acid which means pollution, just in
another form.

I drive a TDI Golf, which does great on gas, but again, the US isn't strict
on low sulfur diesel and therefore we have more particulates than comparable
fuel in Europe.

I think, at least in my crazy Liberal New Englander mind, that what people
on both sides of the SUV/Gas Milage debate need to realize is that you're
never gonna agree, but what people should be thinking about if they really
care about the environment is what am I driving and why? It's ok to drive an
SUV if you've got a large family, are towing something, etc. But to just use
it to drive around town, that's a shame and to me rather selfish. If you
have a bus like Benoit, you know if you really care about the environment,
you probably shouldn't be using it as a daily driver. Some of us do, some
just use it for weekend get aways. One think I've learned in my short 30
years on this planet is most things are a compromise, so don't feel guilty
driving an SUV or an old car, and don't get a holyier than thou attitude if
you drive a diesel or a hybrid car, because honestly the only way to really
be an environmentalist is to walk (and lets not fart either cuz the methane
will do damage too).

I say if you can rationally think about what you drive and why you drive
what you are driving, and can honestly say that you're doing the best
compromise you can, then I say you're at least thinking about it and making
a concious choice and that's more than half the battle.
