Tom (and the timing light instruction booklet) says:

~
However, since you have the pleasure of using a strobe light, set the
advance to zero (if you have that on your light), give the light some juice
(positive on battery or on coil, negative to ground, not battery negative),
and hook the strobe meter (black box) around the #1 wire.  This takes place
with all plug wires in place, and vacuum lines on, and can be done while the
engine is running.~

  I ended up getting a reading only when I took the strobe meter off the #1
wire and put it to the center wire from the dizzy to the coil! The reading was
accurate...but now I'm re-worried about the wire order since I messed with it
so much!!!
  Or was this still the right way to get the reading???
