Subject: 1959 Single Cab

Hello. I'm new to the list and this is my second attempt at a few
questions. (I'm not sure what happened to the first!)

I recently purchased this once-upon-a-time radically customed show truck.
It's not so radical anymore! Anyway I found an VIN tag laying in the dash
shelf. This is not the plain tag with the model number and colour, that's
on the cab wall behind the seat where it belongs. This is the punched tag
with &quot;Volkswagenwerk GmbH&quot; across the top and &quot;MADE IN WEST GERMANY&quot;
across the bottom. Where was this originally mounted!?

Also the engine currently in it is # AE140808. Can anyone help in IDing
this as far as year, type, cc?

Thanks!

Jim
