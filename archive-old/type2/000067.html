Volks,,

 Im getting ready to install (72 pancake)  a rebuild that I have done with a 
lot of help. Thankyou to all that have helped and one or two that I've 
imposed on a lot. My new problem or concern is... My heater boxes (I think 
thats what there called) the devices that come off the heat exchangers and 
have the valve on top that hook to the heater control cables and go to the 
rubber connectors  that connect to and send heat to the front are in 
questionable but usable repair. Where they connect to the heat exchanger  one 
heat exchanger outlet is out of round and the tube that connects to it is ok. 
 It makes a less than perfect fit, while I can get it to hook to it I need to 
wrap with metal exhaust wrap and/or whatever to get a good seal. does anyone 
have any suggestions or should I just try to find replacements?
 Thankyou,
  David
