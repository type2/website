I am pretty strongly with Bob Hoover on this.  The problem is that I know
of no source for the tool you need.  If you go to the RMMW site
(http://www.motorworks_dot_com/aircooled/index.htm) and look up part # 30282,
you will see what you need to compress the cylinder up to the case for
accurate measurement on a Type 1 engine.  The problem is that stud spacing
on the Type 4 engine is different.. the tool will not fit.  It would be
easy enough to get a machine shop to make you up a tool like this for the
Type 4 stud spacing, but it would not be cheap :-(  If anyone has a souce
for deck height tool that fits the Type4 engine, by all means let us know!
