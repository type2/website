Before proceeding further, you absolutely MUST go to this web page and
follow all the Schwimmerwagen links.  If nothing else you'll be thoroughly
entertained, and you might just pick up some pointers about what does and

Doublecab!) and with my sincere VW leanings I would love to use VW parts for
it.  &lt;&lt;
