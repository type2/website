Subject: Re: [T2] Type 4 oil sender, what is best?? 

&gt; Any other suggestions on location???

Bus depot and other vendors sell a sender that is threaded through a 
hole in the sump plate. It's up to you to provide the whole, and you 
will have to shorten your dipstick per the included instructions.

If you are very lucky, and haunt the boneyards, you can find a 914 sump 
plate with a pre-formed place for the sender.
