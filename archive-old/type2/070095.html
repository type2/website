Subject: Cooler to Fridge Conversion

Hi folks,

I'd be interested in hearing details from anyone who has converted their
68-72 cooler to a fridge. I've seen conversion kits advertised for $300 or
so (I think it was in the West Marine catalog) and I believe RV outlets also
sell such a conversion kit.  I'm curious as to what kind of sacriligous
cutting must be done to the Westy cooler to fit the kit, and if anyone's
done it, was it worth it.

Thanks,
 
Ron
