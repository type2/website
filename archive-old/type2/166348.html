&gt; Bob is referring to sound insulation, and yes the westy interior

So am I, and the lack thereof!  The only sound insulation that they put 
in the bus was some padding on the roof of the engine compartment and 
some meager insulation in the walls.

&gt; Have you ever driven a bare bus, with no interior? Its LOUD. Sounds
&gt; like you're throwing a metal garbage can
&gt; down the driveway when you hit a bump. Add the westy interior back and
&gt; it ain't so bad.

But it is SOOOOO much improved if you actually put sound proofing on the 
bare metal.  It's like night and day.  If you've ever driven in a 
Vanagon, you'll know what I mean.  They learned from their previous mistake.

&gt; I'm trying to track down some noise coming from my rear axle(s) or
&gt; tranny and I can't.... have to get out
&gt; and listen while someone else drives. The noise is pretty loud...
&gt; possibly my CVs ending their expected lifespan.
&gt; This is a pretty distinguishable noise and I didn't get it until I
&gt; heard it from outside. Thats pretty good sound
&gt; isolation.

I guess.... and you probably can't hear the car honking behind you over 
the rest of the bus racket - good isolation? :)

&gt; I recently had to throw out the front carpet mat in the front of my
&gt; westy... there was no hope on saving it. I replaced it
&gt; with the rubber mat from a previous bus. It happened to be raining
&gt; that day... I couldn't believe how much more splashing on
&gt; the undercarriage I could hear with no carpet there. Every little piece helps.

And actual dynamat (or equivalent) makes it *that* much better.  Don't 
get me wrong, having some padding is better than no padding, but stock, 
VW did a horrible job of addressing sound levels in the bus.  Because I 
haven't insulated the front, it's still difficult to have a normal 
conversation in my bus, and that's with the *stock* setup.  In the back, 
though, it's like night and day.

&gt; Sure, you can go out and spend hundreds of dollars on dynamat and
&gt; other sound isolating materials, but a properly functioning stock
&gt; exhaust with the stock westy interior is not bad at all... even on the
&gt; highway.

I think it cost me 90 bux for the rubber mat stuff, another 15 for the 
bubble wrap, and regular insulation is cheap.  That's not a bad price 
for some sanity.  It is a lot of work, though!
