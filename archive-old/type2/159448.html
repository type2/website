Subject: Continual backfire through the intakes?

Greeting and hallucinations All,

The other day, I was fiddling with a friends '82, and when I got it 
fired off, it seemed to backfire rather continuously through the 
intakes.  This was so obvious, the almost continuous &quot;pop&quot; and feeling 
the shock in my fingers when I would touch the &quot;S&quot; pipe.  I started 
pulling plug wires and when #1 was disconnected the majority of the 
popping went away.  When # 3 was removed as well, the engine ran without 
popping, but would not respond to throttle.  Also, there is quite a bit 
of lifter or valve train noise in this engine.  All of this has occurred 
over the past few weeks, beginning with the rather odd symptom of not 
wanting to keep running unless revved high for a few minutes.  Usually 
within about 10 minutes the valve train noise subsides, and the van 
actually runs well then, pulling even with most traffic up to about 70MPH.

Anyone have any ideas how serious this could be?  I have not been able 
to pull the valve covers and check the rockers or adjustments.
