Clark:  Is it really an issue that people lug a VW bus engine?  Let's talk
specific... is lugging going less than 1500 RPM in 4th?  I mean my 1971 bus
would barely climb a 2_at_ grade at that... (type1 engine).

I would thing that a &quot;guest&quot; driving your bus would thing: &quot;&quot;&quot; Humm, this
thing is damn slow, I must be shifting too early... let's let it rev way up
before we shift.  Yha, that runs faster! &quot;&quot;&quot;  -- Especially if they are used
to running high-rev modern 4 or 6 cylinder engines.

I'm serious, do you really encounter people who lug their VW bus?

OK, you've stoked my paranoia into a white hot fury!   ;-)
I know that people think this way and so now I'll never lend my bus out
again!  See what you've gone and done?

Watching my gauges as I go back to work...   :-)
