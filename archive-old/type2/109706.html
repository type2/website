Subject: Dizzy saga cont.

I'm still wrestling with my distributor on my 69 and it seems that I have 
tried all advice I've recieved from the list and still the Bus does not 
start. It has been sometime since I messed with it last and from what I 
remember last (and please correct me if I'm wrong) was that there is a 
difference in where #1 is on the 009 as opposed to the stock 205T vac adv
such as below

                   1          3
             009 2   4  or  4   2 205T
                   3          1
--------------------Rear of Engine--------------------------------------------

The only thing I tried to do was swap the distributors out from a 009 to the 
stock dizzy and get no start. I went back to the 009 and now no start. I'm 
beginning to think my gas has gone bad, how long does it take gas to go bad 
in a tank? Anyway, I got spark all over and the gas is flowing, no vacuum 
leaks that I can tell I just think there is a timing problem somewhere, 
anymore advice is appreciated.
