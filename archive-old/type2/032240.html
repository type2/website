I have a '77 van the engine of which I am rebuilding.  I have gotten the
heads on, and would like to add the lifters, but I have these awful long
'much bent wires' that go in under the lifters -- somehow.  I recall
trying to understand how they came out as I dissassembled, but wasn't
really able to see what they were doing.  what do they do, and can anyone
take a stab at explaning their routing?  What about their purpose in life?


Thanks!
