&gt; Regarding various comments on side to side play on CV joints, this
was my
&gt; post above some time back.
&gt; 
&gt; I just noticed in Haynes that it mentions that an instruction went out
&gt; sometime from VW to the dealers telling them to leave off the
concave washer
&gt; when renewing the joint.

Bentley also repeats the instruction to omit the washer.  I've run it
that way for a long time with no problems.  Oddly, VW never issued a
similar &quot;omit the washer&quot; instruction for B*etle CVs.

&gt; So if your CV is original its quite likely there
&gt; will be little side to side play, but if it's like mine you'll be
able to
&gt; move them side to side about 1/4 inch. It runs fine.

OK, just to clarify, please note that _none_ of the axial motion of
the CVs is due to the splines.  Even with the washers removed it's a
pretty tight fit between the shaft and the CV splines.

Rather, the play is designed into the CV joints themselves.  They
allow the axle to bend up and down (doh!) and also to move in and out
to compensate for the change in distance from the trans to hub as the
wheel moves up and down.
