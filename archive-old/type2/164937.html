&gt; I found an oil leak on my '76 Westy (there may be more). The

&gt; belt and the cover that the tube runs through or is there more to it?

You can do it from below after you remove the lower tinware.

It can be a tough repair when the boots are stiff but the replacement  
boots are soft so you can bend them into place without having to move  
the dipstick tube.

&gt; Just
&gt; looking for advise before I start tearing things apart.

Be sure to get the Viton boot from VWG. It actually lasts vs. the  
others which crack from the heat in a few weeks.
