Subject: Windshield wiper motor innards

On this overcast and drizzly weekend, I finally decided to tackle the
windshield wipers on our '72 Bus.  A few weeks ago, when I tried them,
they were veeeerrrrryyy slow.  I drove to the store and parked the Bus.
When I came out, there was an odd smell in the Bus and the wipers
would not work.  I pulled the fuse, thinking something was amiss.

Anyway, my goal was to replace the wiper motor.  Being resourceful, and
cheap, I found a Type 3 wiper assembly with motor, in the dark recesses
of the garage.  Unfortunately, the gear housing was backwards from that
of the Bus, but the motor looked the same.  I removed the motor from the
housing and started doing the same on the Bus.

After removing all the necessary parts to get to the wiper motor on the Bus,
I pulled the motor housing off and removed the motor.  Upon close inspection
of the gear housing, it appears the motor shaft goes in at a slight angle,
which
the Type 3 motor does not.  The Type 3 does fit into the Bus housing, but
the motor case does not slide over it, because of this angle.  The outer
surface
of the old Bus motor has a slight angle to it, while the Type 3 motor is
straight.

So, looks like I can't use the Type 3 motor in the Bus gear housing, but my
question is this:  Should I be able to do this?  Is the gear housing of the
Bus supposed to have an angle on it, or is it damaged?

Thanks,
Dave
