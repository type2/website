Subject: Re: [T2] &quot;Stuttering&quot; under load?

i had a similar problem, it endeduop being the piece of crap Fuel Presure Regulator (Facet).  Removed it and and haven't had a problem since.  paul.

 

.This is new.

I've got a crappy little 99c plastic fuel filter (like you see on bugs all the
time) in there now. I finally chased down a larger metal can filter that I'm
going to put in tonight (I hope - Just got a root canal yesterday. Still
hurts.) Is it possible this is the problem? Anything else I should be looking
for
