Subject: pop top cleaning suggestions

Bleach works for me-- just did it last week.

A few years ago someone on the list suggested wiping on a coat of
Penetrol after cleaning the top. I tried that, and for a minimal
amount of work I thought it came out very nicely. I give my top the
bleach/penetrol treatment two or three times a year... keeps it
looking fairly good.

You can get Penetrol at some hardware stores, or places like West Marine.
