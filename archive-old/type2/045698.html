I'm was wondering if there were any listees in the Portsmouth, New Hampshire
area.

Thank you
Rob

It looks like I'll be taking a quick work-related trip to Germany in the
next couple of weeks.
Are there any listees in Frankfort? I'd very much enjoy the opportunity to
meet someone familiar with the bus scene there. Also...what VW sites should
I visit during my free time?
I'll be arriving on a Sunday and staying 2 - 3 days.
thanks in advance
John Flowers
