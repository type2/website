Subject: Re: CD Player in Buses

I have a Pioneer tape deck and multichanger, with the multichanger mounted
upright behind the passenger seat. The installation manual did say that it
can be upright or lying down. 
But... 

With an in dash CD player the angle can sometimes be critical, because the
anti-roll mechanism works best when it is flat. The range of angles differ
between manufacturer, With most good quality CD players I have found no
problems angling them out of spec. Also the correct angle is more important
if your bus is lowered and/or has stiff shockers. Mine is low and stiff :)
and if I hit a BIG bump the CD changer will skip, but I don't think any CD
would survive! 

The angle won't make your player wear out quicker.
