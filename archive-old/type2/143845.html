&gt; I have tried the old cork style, and the rubber rubber ones (twice) and they

New cork gaskets every time (they're cheap)

Make sure that the spring bails that hold the covers on haven't lost their
spring or become tweaked.

Use hylomar on the valve cover side of the gasket.  It provides enough
stick to keep the gasket on the cover and seal things but doesn't harden.

Use nothing on the head side of the gasket.

Make sure the mating surfaces are clean clean!
