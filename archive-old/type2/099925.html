Subject: Re: [T2] wanted windage tray for type IV

&gt;&gt;Anyone have a windage tray in good shape for a type IV motor?
&gt;
&gt;Not only do I not have one, I've never even seen one!  Those things are 
&gt;rare, in fact I'm not sure they exist.  :)

Oh yes, they do exist.  All 914 2.0's had them, and maybe the 1.8's also.
They're actually not too hard to come by.  What's hard to find is the 4
rubber gaskets that go on them.  As far as I know, no one ever repro'd them
and they do periodically get damaged while mating the case halves.  Don't
use the windage tray without them!
