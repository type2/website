Subject: Re: Bus tires

Hi,

&gt; Geez, I just purchased a new set of tires for my '79 Westy.  I thought I
&gt; did my homework and eventually decided on a full set of 185R14 Michelin MX
&gt; 6ply reinforced tires with a load/speed rating of 94R (1540lbs.) 

 These sound OK to me, but the &quot;94R&quot; rating doesn't tie up with your
stated weight rating: a 94R tyre is rated to a maximum of 1477lbs at
a maximum speed of 106mph. Do they have the &quot;C&quot; suffix?

&gt; But now am I to assume that these are not up to spec?

 IMHO they are (just) within spec.

 I wrote that 95 was a minimum and 97 offered better handling. I also
suggested that &quot;most listees&quot; thought that this was the case, which,
on reflection, was probably an overstatement if not an outright lie...

&gt; Where did you get these figures?  I searched through the archives for tire
&gt; info and didn't find any specs this demanding.  Most tire dealers I spoke
&gt; with said the reinforced MX was made specially for Vanagons; most also
&gt; did not stock these tires and had to place a special order.

 I got those figures from my interpretation of the postings to the 
list on the improvements in handling that listees have experienced 
with &quot;Load range D&quot; and similar tyres, from my own research (reading
and driving experience) on the subject over a period of several years
and from reading owners and workshop manuals.
 I should have said something like &quot;some listees report...&quot; or &quot;It has 
been suggested...&quot; but hey: this is the net!
 I am extremely skeptical about claims that the MX was specially made
for Vanagons. There are any number of vans in Europe that use a 185R14C
tyre. I should say that my impression of US tyre dealers generally
is pretty poor, largely as a result of the reports that I've read on
this list, so I wouldn't believe anything I was told by one...

&gt; Since we're on the subject... what exactly does it mean to have a load
&gt; rating of say, 1540lbs?  Does that mean 4 tires with that load rating can
&gt; support 4 x 1540lbs?  Or is this per axle?

 It's per tyre: total load shouldn't exceed 6160lbs in your example, 
but you need to take into account that the rear axle carries more 
weight than the front, so if you have a 60/40 distribution you should
look at the minimum specs for the higher loaded axle.

&gt; I don't have the owner's manual for the Westy... anyone know the weight of
&gt; one of these?

 For a '78 Westy (&quot;Campmobile&quot;) the GVW is listed at 4961 lbs. Gross rear
axle weight 2800 lbs. That suggests a minimum of 1400lbs.
 The Kombi and delivery van go up to 2866 lbs.
 A load index of &quot;93&quot; would be 1433 lbs so you could argue that this
is all you need. You won't convince me, though :-).

 The Vanagon requires a &quot;97R&quot; load rating. You can get away with a bit 
less on a type2. IMHO that &quot;bit less&quot; gets you to a minimum 95.

&gt; Anyway, I've had these Michelins for a week and have been very happy.  Oh,
&gt; she handles like a dream!  Can't wait to see how gas milage improves.
&gt; Although... anything would have been an improvement over the
&gt; cracked and balding old Yokohamas I used to have!

 Don't worry, be happy! I'm sure these will be fine. You might like to
try and get an opportunity to drive a bus with higher rated tyres in a
crosswind, though, you may be surprised at the difference.

Cheers,
	  W.
