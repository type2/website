&gt; Cleaning the wire connections I had shoved two of them up behind something

&gt; connected the remaining wires and forgot to pull the others back down.

The number of wires on the sarter terminal varies depending on year and
accesories.  &quot;Losing&quot; one is very easy and most of them are necessary to
get the engine to start.  When I remove these wires I bring a zip-tie or
twist-tie under the bus with me and slide them straight off the stud onto
the twist-tie.  That way they are all in one place when it comes time to
reconnect them

OOK!
