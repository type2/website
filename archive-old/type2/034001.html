Subject: [Friday] Like Fridays?  Wish they could last all week? 

Here's your chance.  A new concept- the all-Friday, all-the-time Bus/Vanagon
list!
Open to all VW Bus and Vanagon enthusiasts and lighthearted individuals,
regardless
of age, creed, country of origin, color, or type of coffee that you drink.

Check it out here:

http://www.egroups_dot_com/group/bus-life

(egroups is free.  That's why we're using it.  I'm cheap, and Proud Of It.)

This is not to become competition with any other lists, it's simply a forum
for discussing verboten topics on days other than Fridays.  Think cheese to
the other lists' tacos.  This is an all-cheese list.

HENCE:  NO TECH ADVICE.  No technical talk whatsoever, this is for the other
lists.  We talk about sightings, trip reports, toys, living on, in or near
busses, frustration, anger, happiness, cops, music, Mustang drivers, camping
spots, hot dog prices, kids, apple pie, trips to Greenland, favorite music,
Hell, anything
we want AS LONG AS IT AIN'T TECHNICAL! (and it has to KINDA relate to VWs.
Our interpretation of that is quite liberal)

We also welcome good-natured semi-off-topic arguments.  So if you'd like to
banter about
Jimmy's VW Heaven shafting your grandmother on a tune-up and the thread gets
killed on
the List, bring it on over.  It's all content to us.

This list will only fly if we get subscribers.  We have 45 now, and we're
growing!  So here's
your chance to get in on all of the super-cool fun!

See y'all on the flip side-
