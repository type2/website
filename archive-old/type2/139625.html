Subject: Re: [T2] Friday topic/rant: measuring tools

Mark,

Gauge the caliper against some drill bits and a micrometer.

I think you might be pleasantly surprised.  A friend of mine bought one of 
the Chinese digital ones on a lark and said it was as good as his $200 
Mitsutoyo(sp?).

I have a couple of expensive Sterret micrometers and everything I have 
measured with them and compared to the cheap caliper matched.

YMMV of course&lt;grin&gt;.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Given the sea of other tools you can get at these places, this makes 
&gt; absolutely no sense. I can't figure it out. I can't even come up with a
