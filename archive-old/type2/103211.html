Subject: Re: [T2] 71 Westy

&gt;Hello all!  I have been away from this list for several years after selling my
&gt;78 Bus, but have seen the light and am actively shopping for another.  I have
&gt;found a 71 Westy that is in decent shape.  But wonder if there are any
&gt;peculiarities to this year model that I need to be aware of.  Any info
&gt;appreciated.

I assume you know that this is a Beetle powered bus, has the weaker 
steering system, and the non-removable drums (requires drum and hubs to be 
removed for brake work)?

I'm a late baywindow guy through and through and just want you to be sure 
that you know there is a difference. Have fun! Good luck!
