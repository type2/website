&gt; well volks, i had my front beam bit welded today by a nice guy down
here in
&gt; fl. he did a good job and $50 later i look as good as new. but im
gonna check
&gt; this bracket every day in the next month.  
&gt; see yous guys who are going in jerome......please find me and say
hi. large
&gt; british gentleman in a blue bus with fl tag.

You might want to find a bumpy dirt road and give that front beam an
&quot;acid test&quot; before you hit the open road.  It would ruin your whole
day to hit an unexpected pothole and find out that the deterioration
in your beam is more extensive than you thought.

If the beam passes the test, you can motor on with confidence!
