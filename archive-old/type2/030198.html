The secret to engineering good radiator systems is pretty much the same as
keeping your aircooled engine happy.  It has to be supplied with a ready
supply of fresh air and you have to make sure that the air passes
through it only once.  This is prettty easy if you stick the radiator on
the front of the bus, as ram air will do the job rather well.  However, if
you want a more attractive installation with the radiator hidden you have
to use more thought.

I've seen installations with a huge radator replacing the engine bay door,
but with no ducting or shrouding to control the air recirculation.  This
setup  overheated despite having a radiator suitable for an American V8.

a good underfloor installation could be done if you partition off the
bottom of the frame rails to make a duct that is as long as possible and
then supply electric fans to keep the air moving when the car isn't. You
cannot rely on ram air to do the job except on the front installations.
I've also seen radiator installations in the left side of the engine bay
with the radiator well-sealed around its perimeter and electric fans.
Despite only drawing air through the left inlet it seemed to work well.
