Volks,
Had a couple of hours this afternoon to really get into the nitty gritty =
of my no start problem. Found problem, but will share the steps for those=
 that have similar issues.

decided to run 12v wire direct from battery to terminal 50 of the starter=
 solenoid............turned key on, and touched the lead to the battery p=
ositive side, started right up.

Next decided to trace wire from connector at base of ignition switch (use=
d Bentley for info) found a 4 wire coupler under dash.    I tried to jump=
er wire from 12v in connector at base of ignition switch to terminal 30 i=
n the same connector, and no start.  Then i disconnected the 4 wire termi=
nal, and jumpered 12v to the terminal 30 wire and it started right up.  T=
his told me I had a bad lead from the 4 wire connector to the connector o=
n the ignition switch.  I removed the wire from the ignition switch, and =
discovered the PO had rigged another wire in there to get a key on + lead=
 for something.........  removed wire connector, crimped on new one, and =
the car starts per stock design now.

(Here's a flack jacket for you, Stan. Good line!!)

Just as the relay kits are a panacea for old wires.
Wires/terms/switches/solinoids/armatures/brushes/bearings get resistant
with age, just like us. &quot;click-click&quot; for start is many times a synergy o=
f
weaknesses throughout the circuit.  The closer you are to stock, the bett=

your &quot;luck&quot; (pocket book) is in the future. Patching is for getting back
home so you can remove the offense with proper follow up repair. Most/all
the time/money spent on patching is no longer available to fix it right. =
So
patching is for emergencies only, like when brokedown in Gooberburg.

Let's say I'm 2000 miles from home and suddenly, &quot;click-click&quot; no starter=
.
Let's say I determine that the starter solinoid is showing it's age as
resistance and must be replaced to fix it properly, but I can't get a REA=

one in Hicksville until too late for my needs, and I most needs to not
spend three days in Elroy and Mona's Kafe with the local-necks that hang
out there and have fun makin' fun of &quot;furren&quot; cars at your expense. I wou=

go to NAPA and get a pushbutton and 20 feet of 10ga wire and terminals an=

make up direct connections at the starter, just run the wires on the floo=
r
to between the front seats for the pushbutton. Now I have guaranteed lowe=
r
voltage drop than the old wires/terms to actuate the old starter
dependably, and have spent only $20/20 minutes. Then pop in a new/reman
BOSCH starter when I get home, and take off the jurusrigusmortus and
salvage the hardware for future value in some way so the jerryricketsmong=
us
is not a total loss. Like maybe then actually replacing the old switch
wires properly shielded and routed to remove another weakness to insure
longer life for the new starter.
