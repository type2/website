Subject: 78 engine / 091 tranny -&gt; 72?

hey volks.  
I've been looking into ways to improve my push up the hills surrounding
Portland, and I was hoping the list had some advice about swapping in a
'78 engine/trans.  Would this be a genuine bolt-in 2L (or 300cc bump)
or are there lots of mismatches in mounting that took place between '72
and '78 that would make this a pita?  I checked the library, and David
Schwartz labeled the '78 the &quot;bastard&quot; (his word, not mine) for some
reason.  I didn't quite follow what he was saying.  Any help on that
would be appreciated.  Anyway, I went so far as to investigate the old
transvair thing, but those kits aren't around much anymore.  
Regardless, if I can keep from driving through the Cascades without my
flashers on with a VW engine, I'd be happy.  This 1700 just don't cut
it.  I'm tired of getting waved at one finger at a time.  All advice
(p-mail too) welcome,

Paul Manning
