&gt; 1) What is the fuel capacity for the '74 - '79 bus? 15 gallons?

15.8 US gallons

&gt; 2) What PSI is the windsheild washer bottle supposed to be at?

that would be an item for the owners manual

&gt; 3) How much fuel does the RESERVE hold? (mine seems to last forever!!)

not listed that I could find, drive until you reach R, fill it up, subtract amount
filled from 15.8 and that's your reserve.
