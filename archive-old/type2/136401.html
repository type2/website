Subject: Re: logic

&gt;I decided that the thing to do is to break the engine
&gt;in, take care of the trash, and then pull the engine.
&gt;At that point I will retorque the heads (a
&gt;recommended procedure, but one that I suspect is
&gt;often neglected) and do the beautifying then.
&gt;
&gt;Makes sense to me, but is there any flaw in my logic?
&gt;

The only flaw I see is that every time I personally
have planned something similar, it just never happens.
Something always comes up that's more important and
before I realize it, several years have elapsed.
Usually by then something else has broken that
requires pulling the engine so I take care of whatever
it was I intended to do then. With my personality,
I've found that I'd better do it right the first time
'cause I'm just not going to go back in unless I have
to. I'll spend hours fiddling with something to get it
just right the first time.
