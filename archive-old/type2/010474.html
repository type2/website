&gt; &gt; Since all of you ARE driving German cars why don't you just stick to
metric
&gt; &gt; measurments for simplicity?
&gt; &gt; It would make life a lot easier for the rest (non US or UK minority I
&gt; &gt; guess) of us and is a bit mor DM as well !  ;)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; lukas,
&gt; Why the english measurements?
&gt; 
&gt; Because in my discussions with mechanics here in the US, a lot of them,
when
&gt; talking about tolerances, for whatever reason, refer to things in
thousandths
&gt; of an inch.
&gt; 
&gt; If i had had the time, and a little more forethought, i would have
converted
&gt; all english measurements to metric before beginning my little calculations,
&gt; but the burning, poorly formed question in my mind was &quot;How many
thousandths
&gt; of an inch does it take to displace a given number of cubic centimeters in
a
&gt; 93mm piston?&quot; .
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Stock&quot; shims around here are .008&quot; or &quot;eight thousandths of an inch&quot;.  If
you
&gt; ask the supplier &quot;so, what is that in mm?&quot; you'll get &quot;Oh, i don't know, do
&gt; the conversion...&quot;.  Eight thousandths is 0.2032mm.
&gt; 
&gt; If i try to tell an american supplier i want a .2032mm shim and stick to my
&gt; metric measurement, he'll have to do the conversion because he sells shims
&gt; that are &quot;eight thousandths&quot; and doesn't *have* to know what the metric
&gt; equivalent is becuase no one is asking him for a .2032mm shim.
&gt; 
&gt; At this point i have made a decision to convert absolutely to the metric
&gt; system in my dealings with my VWs (in addition to all the other foriegn cars
i
&gt; will deal with), but i'll have the conversion factors committed to
permanent
&gt; memory in order to make my discussions with american vw mechanics
productive
&gt; and smooth.
&gt; 
&gt; Not a biggie. There's always this site:
&gt; http://www.soton.ac_dot_uk/~scp93ch/refer/convfact.html  
&gt; which, fittingly enough looks to be UK based.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope not to start a thread on Metric vs English, but suffice to say that
the
&gt; US is very stubborn to convert over.  The entire infrastructure of the
nation
&gt; is put together based on the length of some English King's foot.  It is
&gt; asinine and mediaeval, really.
&gt; 
&gt; If you wanna flame out on this, pmail me and i'll put together a little
distro
&gt; of everybody who mails me so we can all fight with each other and not
subject
&gt; the rest of the list to it.
&gt; 
&gt; Closer to enlightenment and farther away from a 1.905mm shim for a 93mm VW
&gt; type4 cylinder,
&gt; 
&gt; clark in ky
&gt; 
&gt; ps: Does anyone know a source for 8mm -9mm stepped exhaust studs for type4?

&gt; RMMW tech dept says they are stock for 74 1800 head, but they don't have
them.
&gt;  Anyone?  Bueller? ;]
&gt; 
&gt; TIA.
