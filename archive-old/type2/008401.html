&gt; Geez, sorry - I sent the first version in enriched text.  I'll try
again.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's one:  while my engine's out and on the dolly, and I'm
removing parts
&gt; (latest: heat exchangers) to replace or pretty up, what do you all
recommend
&gt; to cover the holes (carb and exhaust ports, so far) while it waits for
&gt; another day?

I usually use the thin plastic bags in which groceries are packed. 
They crush and conform nicely to the hole being plugged.  They also
have enough material to allow an ample amount to hang out of the hole
reducing the chance that the plug will be left inside during
reassembly.  They are not waterproof, but they will keep the majority
of splashes out of the hole.

&gt; At various times the garage swirls with sawdust, sandblasting sand,
kerosene
&gt; and compressed air.

In that case, I'd also cover the entire engine with a sheet of heavy
plastic pulled tight around the sump and secured with a bungee cord. 
This will prevent much of the dust from getting anywhere near the
openings.  Use care when removing the cover, to make sure that the
dust stays off of the engine.
