Maybe.  At the back of the heat exchangers there are two little covers held
in by screws where the heat exchanger meets the fan housing.  Remove them
from underneath.  I'd recommend removing the muffler first, and then the
heat exchangers one at a time.  Laying underneath the bus, grab one with
both hands and try to rock it gently from side to side while pulling down.
Shut your eyes while you do this or you will get dirt in them.
