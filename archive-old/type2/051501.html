&gt;Who has the best write-up on battery tray replacement.

I'm the first to admit that welding in a new one is probably best, but my
homemade/epoxied in one is working fine on both side.  I haven't seen a
downside to it yet, but it's only been in a couple of years.  If you want a
paper template of the size to cut to (to fit a 71`), let me know and I'll
mail one out.  I had 2 cut by a welding class (on a bandsaw), good heavy
stock.  Chiseled out and cleaned up the old spots, left a flange to sit on.
Anit-rusted everything, epoxy, paint and a new battery tray holder and off
we went.  So far so good.  And the engine temp (along with new seals) went
down almost 25 degrees.

Just holler for a template copy.
