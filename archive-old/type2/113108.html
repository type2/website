Subject: center pin replacement

Before I decided to take a dive off a pole this week I started to 
replace the center pin on my front beam. I removed the swing lever and 
using a peice of threaded rod and some washers removed the old bushings. 
I have a replacement kit from BD that has a pin,bushings and some 
assorted seals and washers. I slid the bushings over the pin and there 
seems to be more play than the old worn out ones. Is this normal and 
grease will help take up the tolerance? I also noticed that the new 
bushings have a hole in the side and the original don't. They all are 
labled as german parts. This is for a 78 Westy.
