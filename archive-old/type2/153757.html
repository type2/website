Subject: [T2] Distributor...backwards


&gt; But, it wouldn't start. I troubleshooted everything, and finally
&gt; discovered the distributor was 180 off.
&gt; It's been awhile since I've had a distributor out of an engine, but I
&gt; thought I remember that it can only go in one way.
&gt;
&gt; Any comments on this wierdness?

You're right.  With the offset slot on the top of the distributor drive and
the offset key on the bottom of the distributor's drive dog, the distributor
can only mate with the distributor drive one way.

However, the distributor drive can slide into the engine in a variety of
positions (can't remember the number of gear teeth on the bottom of the
distributor drive) and it sounds like the distributor drive was put in the
engine &quot;upside down&quot; (i.e., 180  degrees off from its correct orientation)
resulting in your distributor also being &quot;backwards.&quot;

You can just live with it, or reposition the distributor drive.
