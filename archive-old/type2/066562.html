I attended a concert at the Marin County Civic Center last weekend, 
no VW's spotted, but there was a wonderful gypsy truck there.  A 30's 
vintage Chevrolet heavy duty truck in excellent shape with a wooden 
gypsy home on the bed, with stained glass windows, curved roof, solar 
panels, covered back porch.  Wooden exterior with graceful carvings.
A pleasure to see.  Obvoiusly not just a vehicle but a home.
