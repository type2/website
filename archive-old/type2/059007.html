These questions are not just to Dan, but the list in general -- anyone who
&gt; might have some idea as to the answers.

&gt; What components are different in a hydraulic lifter system and the 0 mile
&gt; engines that others are selling from Mexico?  Is it easily reverted to solid
&gt; lifters, or are the heads different?

On the post-78 bus engine, when switching from hydralic back to solid, the valves springs need to be replaced,either with stiffer or less stiff springs, I'm not sure which. Also the camshaft is different, while there is contention about whether you can run solid lifters on a hydralic cam, it didn't work out too well for me and I would recommend switching the camshaft and valve springs along with the lifters.

&gt; P.S.  I wrote Dan and he said it was $140 to have his longblock shipped to
&gt; Indiana.  I thought that some of the dealers had figured out a way to ship
&gt; longblocks via UPS and save some $.  Anyone know if that is indeed an option
&gt; for a fully assembled longblock?

UPS still won't ship anything over 70 pounds as far as I know.
