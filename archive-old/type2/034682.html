Content-Disposition: inline

My friend and fellow VW wrencher is finally willing to let go of his 69 bus. He's had it for 10 years and put more than
50k on it. It's a '239' chassis number, but a hardtop walk-thru bus with no original westy equipment. It has a nice
custom bed and cabinet unit in it, interior very functional - good commuter bus. It's been in good hands for a long
time, and has been serviced mechanically over that period. It has rust - specifically in the rockers, but spreading. The
heavy parts of the chassis look okay though and I'd say it's good for another 5 years of Northern winters, but could use
a rustoration to make it pretty again. Comes with alot of extra parts. He's looking for $800-$1000 obo. Contact Joseph
at JS8852_at_cnsvax.albany_dot_edu     The bus is in Albany, New York.
