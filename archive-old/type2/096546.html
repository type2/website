Subject: Re: [T2] stranded bus in Provo, UT

Richard,

Air out of the crankcase is the most important part....lots of air?
Leak down shows what percentage of loss?

Leak down/compression on other cylinders??


If so, then broken rings, holed piston maybe.  

1/2 quart in 100 miles is bad.  1/2 quart in 1,000 miles is good...di you 
miss a zero there?

What does the spark plug look like?....lots of info to be found 
there....oily???  Destroyed?


Cheers ,dave

&gt; Greetings to the list. We have list member Giles Clement and his brother 
&gt; Anson at my home garage in Provo after they found my name on the AIRS 
&gt; directory. The number one cylinder on their 78 bus shows no pressure on 
&gt; a compression test, and a leak down test  shows no pressure in the 
&gt; cylinder with the air intermittently coming out of both intake and 
&gt; exhaust ports as the engine is jogged. Air continually leaked through 
&gt; the crankcase. At 60 mph, there was some activity in the cylinder but 
&gt; not much. This was tested by pulling the spark plug wire as the vehicle 
&gt; was moving, and noticing a change in performance.
&gt; 
&gt; Our best guess would be that the piston has broken rings, but oil usage 
&gt; is not excessive... half quart in a hundred miles.
&gt; 
&gt; Based upon this info, any suggestions as to how to proceed from here 
&gt; would be appreciated. Ideas on what the problem is caused by would be 
&gt; appreciated. Also, any ideas on how to patch the vehicle so that Giles 
&gt; can make it home to New York would also be a help.
&gt; 
&gt; What other tests can we perform to further isolate the problem?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any help.
