Just Sat. I broke the interior center light, not sure if I have a spare,
but don't remember having one...gotta be more carefull.  if you run across
one in your wanderings in the junkyard, around here it is real hit or
miss, and lately it has been mostly miss

thanks

&gt; I can do searches. Smaller than bumpers and grilles, please! :-) Let me
&gt; know what you need; we can discuss terms. I'm on a first-name basis with
&gt; the folks at the junkyard these days. :-) Shipping from Southern California.
