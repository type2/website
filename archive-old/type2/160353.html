Subject: Re: [T2] Ignition switch replacement

One thing that happened after I wrote that article was that the switch I 
bought and installed from BD became very intermittent.  I had to do it all 
over again a month later, but this time I installed a used original VW 
switch.

It's been working fine for many years now.

Scoot Lyons indicated the bolt size:

Tamper screw is m8 x 1.25. An allen hex screw is a good replacement.


Brad


&gt; Just ordered P/N 171 905 865MY from the BD.  Assuming &quot;MY&quot; is for Meyle
&gt; brand.
&gt; 
&gt; I plan to use Brad Clausen's writeup on Ratwell_dot_com and the new Bentley
&gt; I ordered.
&gt; 
&gt; One thing I didn't see is the replacement bolt size to use when you
&gt; replace the tamper-bolt.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone?
&gt; 
&gt; Any other gotchas?
