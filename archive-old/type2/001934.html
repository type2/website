Hmmm, well I have been driving Westfalia vans off and on since 1970, most of
them stock, with vacuum advance distributors.  I have never gotten over 20
mpg in any of them.  I am certain my driving habits have a lot to do with
it, but Westfalia's weigh a whole bunch, too.  Though my current Westy does
not have a pop-top, that was also a consideration in my earlier vans.
    I think the real answer though, is that the mechanic who tuned the carbs
believes that a little rich is far better than a little lean in an
air-cooled engine, an opinion shared by Gene Berg in his catalog.  I think a
little loss in gas mileage is a small price to pay for an engine that runs
cool and will last a long time.
    However, it may well be that a leaner running engine would save enough
fuel to offset the possible shortening of life of the engine.  This is a
matter of personal preferance, I suppose.

&gt;Kevin,
&gt;
&gt;Is 18-19 the best highway mileage you get in your '71 or is that just
&gt;around town?
&gt;
&gt;Our '71 (the one in really good repair  ;-)   ) got 21 to 24 mpg when we
&gt;drove to Alaska two years ago--and once even 25 mpg, but that was going
&gt;down a reeeeally big hill!
&gt;
&gt;We have everything stock, blue coil and stock distributor (vacuum
&gt;advance).

&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have a '71 westy with dual kadrons, 1900 cc and blue coil with a 009
&gt;&gt; dist., and get 18-19 mpg.  I would check how you have the vacuum hooked
up
&gt;&gt; to the dizzy.  I don't think Kadrons are set up for vacuum dizzy's, I
would
&gt;&gt; borrow a 009 ( or other mechanical advance dist.) and see if your mpg
&gt;&gt; improves.
