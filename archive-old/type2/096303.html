Subject: Followup to Bay Area Locksmith

Thanks to all who responded directly and on the list. I followed Chris
Sheridan and Blaine Pedlow's advice to go to Rex Key on University in
Berkeley. You're both right, they were great! Very fast, and only charged
$16 to cut it from the code. Only problem was it was the wrong code! Sigh.

So, to date I've cut a key from the rear hatch and now the drivers side
door lock, neither of which worked. Damn PO's! :-). I've just pulled the
ignition key, and I'm going to get it cut soon. Then to spare some future
owner of my bus the misery I've gone through, I'll get all 5 locks keyed
the same! Perhaps I'll send them all to Steve's lock shop.

Thanks again to everyone who responded.
