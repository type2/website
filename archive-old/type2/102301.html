Dave, I've had similar problems and it's been the points in the
distributor.  Next time it happens take the cap off and blow warm air on
the points.  You might want to go to an electronic setup to eliminate
the points.

Help!  My bus doesn't want to start when it is cold or damp.  It is 2.0
air
cooled 1982 Type 25 with Solex 34PDSIT carbs.  It has petrol to carb,
spark,
(bit weak), clean plugs, new leads and chokes seem to work OK.

All suggestions gratefully received.

Dave
