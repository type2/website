Subject: Re: Frozen lug nutz

&gt;&gt; How much torque can I put on those? I really
&gt;&gt; dont want to snap one off. I have already 
&gt;&gt; bent a lug wrench and shattered an impact socket.
&gt;&gt; Will an impact wrench bust it free if 3-400 ft lbs
&gt;&gt; of torque wont get it out?

I have put my 250lb frame on at least a 6 foot lever arm on rusted on
lug nuts on Bays, U do the math, incredible amount of torque, all 20
nuts.

&gt;You can use a nut splitter (or educated use of a sharp chisel) on the
&gt;offending nut.  This will get it off without damaging the stud.

Unfortunately obviously not on Vanagon fronts being bolts.

Good Luck to the origional poster.
