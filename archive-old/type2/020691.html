Subject: '77 Exhaust

I have an exhaust leak between the head and the manifold on Bleu. ('77
FI) I ordered and received the gaskets that go between the manifold and
the head. However...  Looking at Bentley, it looks like the gaskets are
different between the earlier motor/exhaust systems and the '77-'78
system. The gaskets that I received are the ones shown with the early
system (Bentley Fig. 5-2) and not the one illustrated for the system
that I have (Bentley Fig. 5-3).

Does anyone know for sure? Bleu is a daily driver and I realy need to be
sure before I take it apart.

TIA

Jim
