Subject: '70 bus windows and seat-FREE!

Hey now,
     As some of you know from the trip reports, I converted my bus to westy
when in Los Angeles. So, the side windows, ventwings, and the rear passenger
seat are all at my grandfather's house in Palos Verdes (LA area, south bay
actually), and are free for the taking. The seat is in very good condition,
with only one very small tear, and the windows are all good. So if you want
them, give Sparky (grandpop) a call at 377-1260 and arrange a time to pick
them up. Enjoy!
Peace,
Eddie
