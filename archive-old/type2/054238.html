Subject: Dual vacuum fix

Hi all

I had our '76 2000ccFI in the shop to get an idling problem fixed. They said 
that the total advance was too high, so they disconnected the vacuum hoses to 
the distributor (dual vacuum can) and timed the engine to 26 degree total 
advance and replaced the points. 
Now the engine runs like crap and overheats.
Please help me unfix it by telling me which way to reconnect the vacuum hoses:
The advance goes to the intake air distributor vacuum?
The retard goes to the rear of the throttle valve housing?
They also disconnected the small vacuum line leading to the EEC cut off valve 
on the air cleaner body, where does that one connect?

Thank you profusely
Bucket
