I had never worked on a car in my life either except to change a tire or
maybe the oil. My first attempt on anything was to pull the engine out of my
71 camper to change the oil seals, throw out bearing alternator (not that you
have to take the engine out to dothe alternator), and clutch . My next job
was the front brakes for the camper and for my 73 Ghia. The only help I had
was  How To Keep Your Volkswagen Alive For The Complete Idiot and my long
time mechanic giving me hints when I wasn't sure.(and I do mean hints) So get
your guide and the tools it says(Ibought a set of metric sockets to start)
and go for it and then buy only what you need. Read through the chapter that
you are using first and then attack the job. GO FOR IT!!!
