Subject: Good weekend to you all

Practice safe and sane driving,  I may be on the road this weekend.

And you shouldn't stop and help EVERY type 2 you see stranded on the side of
the road.

Like my mon always said &quot;No, you can't take that into the house.  You don't
know where it's been!!!.&quot;
