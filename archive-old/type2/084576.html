Subject: Missing wire to flasher switch and weird brake lights.


Now we are doing the electrical on our 1970 Bus project.

No melted wires and all in pretty good shape.

Parking lights, emergency flashers and blinkers all work fine (after I 
fixed some hot-to-body-grounds). Burned up two boxes of fuses.

Did note that when parking lights are on the blinkers can barely be seen, 
but the filament in the bulb is going on and off.

But, no brake lights anytime.

The PO rigged up stop lights attached to the rear bumper (could be a bad 
sign, I said to myself). Bumper and lights were taken off the bus before 
the above was done.

Me and son have been behind the dash with the manuals most of the weekend 
and so far have found the following.

1) Could not find the black-red wire that is supposed to hook up to the 
flasher switch. So, flasher had one less wire than the Bently diags say.

2) After I spliced into a black-red and took it over to the flasher and 
then stepped on the brakes we got the passenger side front parking light 
and the passenger side rear parking light to go on and off when brakes 
pumped. But not both brake lights.

3) Then when we tried the right blinker the small brake alert button light 
on the dash blinked along with the blinders.

4) Finally, the blinker indicator lights on the dash stopped working even 
thought the bulbs checked out OK. Also, I checked and found pulsating 
voltage coming out of the blinker control box wire going to the indicator 
lights on the dash.

5) I did replace the original blinker control box on the fuse box with an 
after marked one. The were both four terminal types.

I plan on spending many more hours troubleshooting the electrical, but 
thought I would ask if anyone could get me thinking on another track.

Many thanks, and pardon any dumb questions!
