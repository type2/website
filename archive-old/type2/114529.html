Subject: FRONT Window Defogger Idea?

Here's a funny story and a possible solution to save you from the same fate:

About 6 years ago I drove my 73 Westy from San Antonio, TX up to Amarillo,
TX to visit my folks.  It was early March and when I left SA at 3 in the
afternoon it was about 90 degrees.  By the time I was 60 miles south of
Amarillo it was 11PM, colder than a brass monkey, and raining/sleeting.  As
it got colder the rain started freezing on my windshield and on my wipers to
the point that the wipers weren't clearing the windshield anymore.  

My (factory) defroster was blowing enough heat to keep an area clear to see
out of, but the bottom of the windshield was icing up so bad the wipers kept
getting stuck there.  I finally pulled over to clear the ice and knock the
wipers clean.  No problem until I tried to get back into the bus.  The
freezing rain had completely caked over the door handle and I couldn't get
the door open!  

I tried the other doors, but they were all locked (and of course the key was
in the ignition).  I was in the middle of nowhere on the side of the road
freezing my ass off trying to figure out how to get back into my bus.  I
tried chipping away at the ice with a rock, but no luck.  I was considering
breaking the vent wing, but then another idea struck me.  I unzipped my
trousers and directed a stream of warm steaming urine at the door handle.
Well, it wasn't pretty, but it did melt the ice and I was able to open the
door.

Anyway, the point of this is that it got me to thinking:  Why not put a
defroster grid along the lower 4-6 inches of the windshield.  That would
keep the glass warm enough so the ice wouldn't build up on the wipers and it
wouldn't interfere with your vision.  Any thoughts?
