Subject: A Fond Farewell

My 72 Bus, Male Menopause, sold this weekend so I am signing off of the
list. My father's steadily declining health and the time I must take to
help him forced a reordering of priorities. My participation stretches back
to the Vanagon days of Gerry and Unca Joel and I have always enjoyed the
friendship and technical information that helped me keep my ride alive.

I never posted much as I am not a technical guru but I benefitted greatly
from their advice. My family will never forget Ken's willingness to help
with the electrical problems my son's Beetle developed when he moved to
Memphis fresh out of college to take his first job. To me, that is what the
list has always been about. Don't take this list for granted. You guys are
a special resource that cannot be found anywhere else in the world.

I bid you a fond and affectionate farewell and promise to wave every time I
see a bus on the road.

Peace,
Skip Correll K4ERC
Chattanooga, Tn
