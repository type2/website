&gt; All this discussion of HEAT has prompted me to improve the heat in
&gt; Bleu.  So, what are you all using for a main heater duct (from the 'Y'
&gt; pipe at the rear to the diverter valve in the front)?  I've searched
&gt; locally and the best that I've found is either 3 or 4 inch dryer duct.
&gt; Plastic...  Not exactly what I had in mind.  Is the stock paper/tin foil
&gt; pipe available?  (Ron?)

don't bother with the plastic ones, they melt.

I am using truck flexible exhaust pipe... I found a 25ft roll of the 4
inch stuff at a place that repairs the big rigs.  a 25ft roll will just do
a van.  was about $50 or so if I recall.
