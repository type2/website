Subject: Re: [T2] dropped vavle seat and parts needed and thanks to
  everyone

Jeremiah said:

 hello again everyone,

 first, thanks to everyone who responded to all my queries and silly
questions.  would probably be driving on three cylinders still if not for
you guys.  that being said, i was wondering if anyone new where i could find
a list of the parts i'll need to fix the # 1 intake dropped valve seat?
once again depending on the kindness of others, i will be trying to find a
friend w/ a garage i can borrow indefinitly to drop the engine.  i was
planning on driving goethe to the sonic youth show in kansas _at_ the end of
this month but i don't really think that's realistic anymore and my new
short term goal is to have goethe up and running by august so i can go see
my brother in law graduate from air force officer's training then in
september drive to busses nowhere near the arch.  ambitious?  for the rest
of you maybe not.  for me, absolutly.  but i'm acutually really excited and
looking forward to dropping the engine and doing this work.  now just to
find the parts, time and a garage.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

With just a good used head, I have done this job easily by myself in my driveway in one day........ the 1/2
side is a lot easier than the 3/4 side!

Drive bus up ramps, jack up rear of bus and use tall kack stands,  drop engine, remove exhaust, remove intake,
remove tin, remove head, clean tops of P&amp;C's, install head, clean tin, reinstall all pieces, install engine,
lower bus off jack stands, drive away.
