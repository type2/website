As I was crawling undeneath my camper again last night to get more familiar 
with what's there I noticed more missing parts.  Damn, but the guy who 
rebuilt this engine (a local Bay Area Bug shop who will go unmentioned for 
now) really took some short cuts and it makes me wonder..

Anyway, there's no tube from the backs of either of my heat exchangers to 
the y-pipe than runs to the front of the bus.  The y-pipe has all it's neat, 
snap-on, insulating blankets though.  The control cables are not hooked to 
the flaps either.  Will this contribute to hot oil temps, considering my 
firewall tin has not been fixed yet?  Is the hot air from the exchangers 
being sucked into the gaps of my firewall tin?  Does gravity hold the flaps 
open or closed?

What kind of ducting goes here?  Accordian hose?  Rubber, paper?  What's it 
called so I can look on line for them?
