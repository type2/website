Subject: Re: [T2] kick panel question???

the 73 westy I had had the brake fluid reservoir under the drivers seat.   
But some years have them on the nose, where you're more likely to spill the 
brake fluid, right?  And there was a plastic cover that fitted into the hole in 
the kick panel.   ????  Or am i mixing it up with the windsheild washer fill?

&gt;I was wondering 
&gt;if the kick panels were the same from '68 through '79, or if there were 
&gt;changes.   Cause I'm set up to make kicks like the ones I pulled out of a 
'77.   Do 
&gt;those work for all years?

The location of the brake fluid reservoir at least mean there are more than 
one kind.

Looking at BD's catalog there are 68-70 and 71-79 sets for sale.
