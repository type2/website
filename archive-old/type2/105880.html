&gt; It looks to me like the oxygen sensor might be bad, resulting in a rich
&gt; mixture. If you disconnect the sensor on a properly tuned '79 CA bus, your
&gt; CO will go to about 6%, which is close to your numbers.

No, that's not right.  A properly tuned engine - everything else being
equal - should pass smog even with the O2 sensor disconnected.  The O2
sensor is there to try and nudge the mixture back into the proper range when
everything else *isn't* equal.  CO volume % at idle for the '79 California
vehicles with O2 sensor disconnected is listed as .2% to 1.2% per the
Bentley.  Although the O2 sensor may not be working properly it likely that
the idle mixture needs to be adjusted.  Get a new O2 sensor and a voltmeter
and you can adjust the mixture properly.
