Subject: Re: [T2] VW vs Porsche Backyard Mechanic?

Phil,

The biggest part of switching is the parts price.

I've heard at least 3X or so for the smae type of parts between
a VW and a Porsche...maybe even more...

Go here and compare parts prices...including lots of NLA for things
like 914 cylinder heads....

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; is the 912 (not the 1976 version). It looks like a 911, but has two less 
&gt; cylinders.
&gt; 
&gt; My question is to those that are fortunate enough to have two great air 
&gt; cooled cars. How easy or hard is it to work on the Porsche's compared to the 
&gt; VW? Are parts as available as the VW? Is the Porsche network as good as the 
&gt; VW one? Any other comments/advice?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance for help, Phil.
