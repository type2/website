Subject: Re: [T2] Original Paperwork.Why is it important

 I have all my original paperwork on my 1971 Westy.Sales receipt, manuals, 
&gt; maintenance records and more.
&gt; I find it interesting, but is it worth anything?

Not on eBay maybe but if I buy your bus later down the road I'm going to be a proud and happy new owner 'casue I can sit at the dinner table the first night and browse the history of this bus. I'm also going to be a bit more eager to buy your bus rather than the other guy's bus b/c I can see what has been done.
