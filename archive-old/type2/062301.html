&gt; &gt; here goes the debate again, i've read here to use 87 octane everytime, but i've
&gt; &gt; been told to run nothing but premium which is supposed to be better for the
&gt; &gt; engine. what's the real truth?
&gt; &gt;

&gt; 
&gt; Depends on several factors (not necessarily in this order):
&gt; 
&gt; 1)  Compression ratio.  Usually anything over 8~8.5:1 requires higher
&gt; octane rating.
&gt; 2)  Ignition timing.  The further advanced the timing, the higher the
&gt; octane needed.
&gt; 3)  Fuel mixture.  The leaner the mixture, the higher the octance rating
&gt; required.
&gt; 4)  Elevation.  The lower the elevation, the more air available for
&gt; combustion, requiring higher octane fuel.  (I know this is a very
&gt; simplified explanation, but I think for practical purposes, it'll do.)
&gt; 
&gt; Probably a few other factors figure in here, but I think the above is
&gt; pretty widely-accepted opinion.
&gt; 
&gt; The owner's manual from my '79 bus calls for 90 octane gas.
&gt; 
&gt; When I had my '79 FI bus' engine rebuilt by Mark Stephens, I told them I
&gt; wanted to run it on gasoline with an octane rating of as little as 85.
&gt; My bus' engine now runs fine on 86~87 octane.  The elevation of my town
&gt; is 3,750 feet, where the air is fairly thin.  My engine's compression
&gt; ratio is now 8.0:1, but the combustion chambers were modified, using
&gt; Stephens' &quot;zero deck height&quot; and &quot;head unshrouding&quot; technology.  They
&gt; also balanced pistons/rod sets to within less than half a gram of one
&gt; another and volumetrically balanced the combustion chambers.
&gt; 
&gt; An alternative is to use cylinder spacers to lower the compression
&gt; ratio, so that you can run the thing on cheaper gas.  With price
&gt; differences of 10-30 cents or more per gallon between different grades
&gt; of gasoline, buying the cheapest grade of gas can save you a lot of
&gt; dough in a hurry.  In Mexico, some Pemex stations out in the sticks
&gt; offer only 83~85 octane leaded gas (Nova), although premium unleaded
&gt; (octane 90?) is becoming more widely available.

Good point, Roy. Other factors are engine temp and engine load. The 
hotter the engine runs the higher the octane... and if you pull heavy 
loads (hills, etc), especially when lugging, you'll need to bump octane 
a bit.

Oh yes, the local experts recommend running premium unleaded fuels when 
leaded isn't avaialble.
