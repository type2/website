Big time bust ass a-coming for me 'till after the holiday. Don't need 2000
e-mails fer blanket download and delete waitin' on Tuesday.

P-mails whenever you like, I'll respond on Tuesday if I don't see it by
Thursday PM.

If your drivin' this weekend, know there will be apes out there who spent
the afternoon a bathin' in the mash tun.  Don't be a-reachin' fer the
sunglasses nor trying to clean them while yer drivin'. Pay attention,
think, prepare, survive the clear and present dangers of the road and the
ones a-hidin' waitin' fer you at any particular convienient second that
might crop up on the biggest apes in bumpercars ritual of the year. 

God's grace protect you all and with a little help from you, keep you safe.
