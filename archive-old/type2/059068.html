Subject: Re: Roofrack

Yakima makes pretty nice racks that fit the Westy. I've got one. You
have to get the High-Rise Towers, and get the mounts that bolt on to the
pop-top. It's strong enough to carry canoes, etc, but when I carry a
canoe or my sailboards, I also tie a rope from the front of them to the
bumper so that there isn't as much wind loading on the poptop.

&gt; Is there some sort of a roof-rack that I could use on my '72 Westy?  The one
&gt; that it came with is great for luggage, but I wanted to get a ski rack for my
&gt; snowboard, and was wondering if such a thing would be possible.
