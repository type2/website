very interesting. I have not measured any &amp; was going from memory,
shoot thanks Scott. now I gotta wait till I get home tonite to measure
the heads I have laying around to verify that my eyesight is a pitiful
micrometer :)

&gt; type IV heads seldom have stem seals installed, not sure why not. ETKA lists
&gt; an &quot;oil scraper ring&quot; for some type IV's.

where were these things installed? When I envision oil seal for a
valve I picture the o-ring similar to american cars, but this just
wouldn't work for a VW design.
