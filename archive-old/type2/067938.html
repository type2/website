Subject: LIST T-SHIRTS

Howdy all. As of this point all the orders except for Tom Forhan's have been
mailed out. Everyone in the US should have theirs by this afternoon, and all
the foreign orders should be coming in soon. If you sent money, and don't have
your order by next week, please let me know. But, give the good ol' US Mail a
couple days before you do.
  Anyway, several folks have been asking about shirts still available. I do
actually have 3 VW designs, and a couple other designs, left over from my
cross-country trek last summer. All are $16.00, which includes shipping and
handling. Since there are limited numbers, please e-mail me if you are going to
order one. I'll confirm I still have some, and then PLEASE send the order.
Since there are limited numbers, please don't reserve a shirt that you don't
intend to order.
Ok, here are the designs, all on high-quality &quot;made to be worn and enjoyed and
hold up in the wash&quot; t-shirts.

 1. Air Cooled Search &amp; Rescue Team shirts- gray shirt with red print of the
standard fireman's 4-pointed cross, with a VW logo in the center. Top arm has a
line drawing of a splittie, bottom has a drawing of an early Beetle. Left arm
says&quot;PROTECT&quot;, and the right arm says &quot;SAVE&quot;. The words &quot;Air Cooled&quot; are above
the crest, and &quot;Search &amp; Rescue Team&quot; are below. These have been described as
my best design yet. I have a few L and XL shirts
 2. Netvergnugen list shirts- These are what started it all. 5 color design has
front views of all 4 generations of busses, with &quot;Netvergnugen&quot; across the top,
and the Vanagon_at_Lenti address across the bottom. Pictures of this shirt with
DIFFERENT COLORS are on my web page (address below). Look at the &quot;GROOVY&quot;
pictures section. Current colors are blue &amp; white splittie, purple late model,
and green Vanagon, white EV.I have TWO (2) XL shirts like this for sale. Get
'em while they're hot...
 3. Split window bus shirt. Front view of a red and white split window bus on a
blue t-shirt. I think these look really nice. I have about 7 XL's left.
 4. Smiley-face alien shirt- a blue shirt or green shirt (your choice) with a
yellow picture that's a standard smiley face, but drawn out in the shape of the
typical alien head and tear drop eyes. I'm wearing mine right now.
 5. Mile 420 shirts- features the green highway mile marker sign, with mile
420. White writing to the side asks &quot;Are we there yet?&quot; Wonderful for the
traveler or those darn hippies out there. A few XL's left

All designs are outlined in black, which adds definition and clarity, for a
sharp looking picture.

SO- if these catch your fancy, please e-mail me, and tell me which one you
want. I'll let you know if there are any left, and then please send the money
and info pronto, so our high-tech shipping dept. can get on the scene!
