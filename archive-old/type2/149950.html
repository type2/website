Subject: Re: [T2] 1977 westy mpg?

The trick to the Comp-U-Fire is the ability to open up the plugs to .050. It
also comes with a 60K volt coil. When running a puny single carb, every
little ounce of gas gets burned.

The engine runs so much better, I thought I rebuilt the entire motor in my
sleep. The fuel mileage increase was noticable (about 4 mpg improvement).
The motor also is free of dead-spots in the powerband.

I am just sad my Redline/Weber EFI isn't compatible. I hope the MSD that
came with the kit works as well as the Comp-U-Fire.

Jon

&gt; while it starts and runs smoother I haven't noticed any MPG improvement.
