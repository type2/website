Now it is not that bad, really.

However, use hard wire and a Inherit gas tip, no flux core with the wire
feed.  Make sure to only do 1/4&quot; runs on the body panel and let it cool
hours before doing another 1/4&quot;.

hey Y'all,
Has anybody used one of those wire-feed welders
(gasless, flux core wire) for welding body panels on a
bus?  How do they work? What was your experience? Any
tips for a rookie welder?
