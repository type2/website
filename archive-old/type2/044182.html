Warburton, William sends:

&gt; Pirelli do their P6000 in a 215/65R15 reinforced, the P4000 is available in
&gt; 225/65R15, both with high load and speed indices (and no doubt high prices,
&gt; too!). You can get an Avon Turbospeed CR39 in a 225/65R15, too. These are
&gt; OEM fit for an Aston Martin and would probably make the Pirellis look cheap
&gt; (£400/corner rings a bell). I havn't found a 235/65, yet.

Four hundred pounds a tire? That would mean...uhh, my whole car isn't worth
that much.
