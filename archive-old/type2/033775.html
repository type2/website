Hi,

 My list of things to check would be:

 Tyres (look for 97 or higher load index)
 Steering dampner (makes quite a difference to crosswind sensitivity)
 Shocks
 Front roll bar &amp; bushings.

 If they are all good then upgrading them can help:

 Tyres (go to 99 or higher load index)
 Shocks (heavy duty versions- rougher ride but better stability)
 Upgrade roll bars: front can go to 22mm (7/8&quot;). Rear too, if you can
		    stand to lose the ground clearance. Urethane bushes
		    are supposed to flex less than rubber ones, too.

 Finally, Wheels: go to 15&quot; rims with same overall diameter (less
sidewall
 to flex). This is a big hassle, though. Front air dam is supposed to
 help (havn't tried it myself). Lowering the suspension would probably
 help, too, if you needed to go that far!!!

Cheers,
	W.

PS Tyres are the biggie, assuming your shocks arn't knackered.
