Subject: Brake replacement shopping list - opinions?

Hi all!

I want to have some faith in my braking system, and I figured the best
way to do that was to replace everything in it. So, I headed over to
busdepot_dot_com and started putting together a shopping list. Would someone
be able to take a look at this and give me some feedback? It's for a
1970 station wagon.

I expect to be able to resurface the drums, so they're not included.

I know this doesn't include the line from the MC to the tee connector,
but the only one busdepot had listed stopped at 1969 - any suggestions?
