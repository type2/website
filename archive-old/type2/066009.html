&gt; Hey All,
&gt; 
&gt; a while back i was looking for a possible alternative power source for my
&gt; bus.  I ran across an intesting set up VW had made for a Hybrid VW bus.
&gt; The way it worked (as far as i understand) the engine served as a
&gt; generator while an electric motor, hooked up to the front of the tranny,
&gt; propelled the vehicle forward. When the load for the electric motor was
&gt; too great the gas motor would kick in and help power it....
&gt;  This sounds like a great idea and was wondering if anyone had heard of
&gt; this... AND  this hybrid bus was released in Europe and not sure if it

I'm not sure about that particular bus, but there have been 2 or 3 buses 
converted to battery and/or hybrid power that I've read about. These 
have mainly been converted by groups of college and HS students... as 
well as a few &quot;devoted&quot; folks. Back in the late 60s, our local electric 
company had an electric Toyota.

Mother Earth News sells plans for their conversion of a small car to 
this &quot;technology&quot; using parts avaialble from the late 80s. I used to 
have a copy lying around somewhere, but can't lay my hands on it now.
