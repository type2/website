Hi Volks,

Bryan aka &quot;Innes&quot; &lt;innes_at_clickcom_dot_com&gt; wrote to the List:
&gt; I have a 72 bus in SC that I would like to trade for a T-1 or T-3 of
any
&gt; year or model. [...]

This is, I am sorry to say, an excellent excuse for me to
re-iterate the FART &quot;T does not equal Type&quot; mantra :-)

Your bus is a Type 2, but it also is a 2nd generation Transporter,
which Volkswagen chose to call a &quot;T2&quot;.  So your request might
be taken either as one for a 1st or 3rd generation Transporter,
T1 or T3 respectively, or as one for a Bug or VW 1500/1600,
Type 1 or Type 3 respectively.

T stands for Transporter.  T does not stand for Type.

My favourite example is that an '81 Vanagon would be a Type 2, T3, 
with a Type 4 engine.  It is not a T2, that's a Loaf.  It is
not a Type 3, that's a VW 1500/1600.  And it does not have a 
T4 engine, which would be out of a Eurovan.

The only way to stop the confusion is for everyone to do it the
right way.  Please.  ;-)

TGIF and TIA!

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
