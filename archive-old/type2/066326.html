&gt; Jean Baptiste Le Pesant asks &quot;What are &quot;Deadhead&quot; stickers&quot;?

Chris' definition that deadhead stickers have to do with a busses
impending death, the more, the closer to death, is simply wrong.  

The term &quot;Deadhead&quot; has been used by cross-country truckers since the
1930s to denote driving their rigs from one point to another with no cargo
to pay the way.  A &quot;Deadhead&quot; sticker in modern etymological parlance
signifies that the driver of the VW bus has made at least one such
cargoless trip from one point to another with conscious intent.  The
subcultural clue here is &quot;conscious intent&quot;.  It speaks of a way of life
where the &quot;process&quot; of driving is more important than its &quot;content&quot;, and a
&quot;Deadhead sticker&quot; is a way of signalling this consciousness.  The VW bus
is chosen vehicle for those who are conscious, realized by only a few,
understood by even fewer, and the &quot;Deadhead&quot; Sticker their overt
acknowledgement of their status...
