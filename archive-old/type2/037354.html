Subject: Everybus 2000 Caravan from Norva

Just wanted to let anyone out there know that Chris forgot to put us on
the list of people to contact for caravaning to Everybus 2000. We  are
in the Northern Va area, Annandale to be exact, if anyone is interested
in getting together. We are leaving early on Friday and will probably be
going down Rte 29. We're hoping to meet up with some people there.
Let me know if you're interested.
