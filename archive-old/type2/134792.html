Subject: Re: [T2] Li'l Bus

From: &quot;Dean Goodmanson&quot; &lt;goodmansond_at_gmail_dot_com&gt;
&gt; I wasn't sure if it was a splittie or an Airstream knock-off.

From what I could see without opening the package, it's definitely a
splittie.  It's got the little windows along the top of the roof, the
classic front profile.  I'm not sure if it's got a VW symbol on the front,
though.  I'll take another look when I go by Sears.
