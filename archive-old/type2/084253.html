Subject: Plans for my foamboard front bed


Troy, that was me at EB who showed the first front bed I made to replace
the cot, and I tried to sell it with no takers (the board, oak for
rails, foam, cloth for matress cover, ande tape to cover edges of board
alone is at least $35 in parts, ($15 for 1/4&quot; good new plyboard, $10 or
so for foam and cloth, $2 for tape, about $10 for oak board, so I was
cheap at trying to sell it for $60; woulda taken $50 and it included my
daughter's artwork!
Essentially, you make a frame of 3 1x1&quot; oak rails cut from a 5/4 X4&quot; oak
board from Home Depot.  I used a tablesaw.  The side rails hang from
nylon rope loops hung from the seatbelt holders and level with the
bottom of the child cot hangers.  I notched the part hanging on the loop
so it cannot slip out.  The other ends lie on the dash and goes to the
windshield.  You can pad with moleskin.  Driver side lies next to the
steering wheel, other side is just at the right of the dash handle.  The
other rail you lay across both and mark the miter angles with a pencil. 
How deep you make the bed is optional; The depth of the board depends on
how you stick the board in and how far back the driver seat goes.  I
based the frame width on how far I could safely slip the turned
passenger seat to the rear past its stop (you only need 3&quot; within the
rail)- I made a stop for the seat by using a piece of cord behind the
seat.  Thus you can sit in the seat while the bed is occupied.
To fasten the rails,  I drilled a horizontal 1/8&quot; hole through each side
into the center of the mitered back rail.  Blunt (8p?) nails and slip
into the holes to hold the rail.  I cut pieces of aluminum plate stock
(3&quot;) and screwed them to the bottom of the side rails so the rear rail
&quot;laid&quot; on these. Drill another vertical hole through each end of the
rear rail right through the aluminum plate.  Slip another nail through
the ends to hold the frame together.  The board width is based on the
width of the dash, and lies on the dash- you may add a cener shim that
takes up the 3/4&quot; gap to the dash top, or let it sag.   I scribed the
windshield curve onto it.  The board is slipped onto the frame from its
storage location above the rear bed.  Drill &quot;stabilizer&quot; holes through
the board and the side frame rails one on each side near the dash, and 2
more near rear.  Add the foam and you have a bed that will hold 150 lbs!

&gt; Hello all,
&gt;             At EB I saw a lot of people that had made a bed that layed
&gt; on top of the dashboard and hung off the seatbelt connectors for the
&gt; back.
