Subject: 2000 East Coast Trip Proposal

All in the spirit of &quot;driving our beloved units&quot; I would like to propose
for consideration and organization the following journey for the year 2000:

{{{{Washington DC to New Foundland}}}}}

Justification:  The west coast bussers are already planning the Tierra Del
Fuego (spelling??) trip so why not at the same time provide the east coast
volks folks with another way to go.  

Not to mention the fact that we would not be running the risk of having
auto-shooters shoved in our faces by some Central American dude dressed in
camo that loves the sight of American blood oozing from the body of an
American body with a set of German set of bus keys tightly wrapped in their
dying hand.  (Certainly don't mean to put a negative spin on that little
adventure.) : )

No, we would only be confronted with the beauty of the French Canadians
that have not yet grown so violently hateful, even though some of them do
not appreciate their southern North American neighbors.  They do like our
dollars though.

We would not have to have our busses shipped back.  Nor would we have to
sell them upon arrival and then fly back crying like babes over the loss of
our dearly departed loaf or micro.  We could just turn around and head for
home sweet home (mechanics allowing of course).  

Time:  Sometime during the spring of 2000.

Anybody interested???
