&gt; We have a working gas heater pulled out of a VW 411 it is a
&gt; BN-4.............for sale.  The harness and all parts are complete.  All
&gt; switches and relays included, and fan.

if it is stock and came from a 411 it would be a BA-4, check the metal
plate attached to the heater body near the blower end
