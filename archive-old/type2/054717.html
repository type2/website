Subject: engine from 79 into 73?

Hey.
I've been thinking.  I know of a couple buses I'd like to put together.
I know I'm spineless about these things, and they never seem to pan out,
but I still think, so I need some answers.

    Can i take a 2000cc from a 79 and put it in a 73?  The 73 has a 1600
in it at the present time.  No one wants a 1600 when they could have a
2000 with hydro. lifters.  I know all the computer stuff has to go, and
all that.  I just want to know if it will fit to the transmission and
the body.  And if the trans isn't the same, can I take the 79 trans,
too?

    Nuts.  I just remembered.  The 79 is automatic.  New question.  Can
I take the 2000 auto and put it in the standard 73?  Alternatively, can
I take the 2000 and the auto trans and put the whole deal in the 73, and
please remind me again why I don't want to do that?


    Sorry my questions always have such twists and turns.  This is what
it's like being me.
