Subject: Re: [T2] RE: [VB] Fuel Filter question, re-usable

True. Sounds much better. However you have a new problem and an old problem.

The new problem is the chance of a rock or other debris kicking up and 
smashing the filter.

Old problem is that without modification we are all faced with gravity feed 
gasoline from the gas tank - it ain't gona stop leaking 'til you're out of 
gas. Broken glass filter = 10 gallons of gas to leak.

Lot's of gas on the ground under a hot engine - or alot of gas in the wind 
blowing back on a hot engine.

That's one of my projects - an easy way to turn off the gas flow with a 
valve for repairs and in case of engine fire.

It's your bus so I'm not preaching, I'm just paranoid...

&gt;I've also been told, and it makes sense, if you're going to use one of 
&gt;these filters splice it into the fuel line somewhere outside the engine 
&gt;compartment, greatly reducing the chance of gas spraying all over the 
&gt;engine if it fails.    Jeff
