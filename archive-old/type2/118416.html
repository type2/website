Subject: Re: [T2] Accelerator cable sleeve

I tried to find the housing looking in the Type2 section of ETKA and
couldn't; might just be that I don't really know what I'm looking for.

Going over to the Vanagon section of ETKA (I'd think this stuff would be
similar) I found:

252 721 573 guide tube for accelerator cable    2430x8

251 721 551 protective tube

Bus Depot has the first at $12.97 and the second (also in a &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot;
flavor) for $20.04 - $21.20.

Not sure exactly what you need.

Subject: [T2] Accelerator cable sleeve


&gt; Greeetings,
&gt;
&gt; Sorry to repost but I can't find this anywhere and hope to place an order
&gt; today.
&gt;
&gt; '79 2.0 liter FI going into a '78 body
&gt;
&gt; I need the part number for the accelerator pedal cable
tube/housing/sleeve.
&gt; This is the black plastic covered sprial wire deal that goes from the rear
&gt; conduit and through the upright cooling tin. Even though I have 2 both are
&gt; bent/tweeked enough so that the end of the cable will not fit through the
&gt; constriction(s). All I can find is cables and no housng. Or any ideas for
a
&gt; fix? My attempts at straightening have proved futile.
