&lt;&lt; According to press releases by the Humboldt Fire Department
and EFI, investigators found
that the cylinder may have come in contact with an aluminum
cleaner, ZEP ALUME-E,
containing hydrofluoric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid,
and ethylene glycol, among other
oxidizers, when it was transported from a drill site six days
before it ruptured. The
investigators reported that the glass fibers of the cylinder
failed as a result of the combined
action of an acidic chemical and stress from internal
pressure.

Wear those gloves!

Cheers, dave

Y'know now that I look at the wheel, maybe it's not THAT dirty...
I've used hydroflouric acid to etch glass (it came in teflon bottle).
I'll pick up a container of the stuff...Should I let in the house? Is
this the stuff Enron uses to clean their files ?-(
