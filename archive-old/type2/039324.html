Subject: '69 coil/carb problems!

All,

Geez, I just spent the day installing new hatch seals
and fixing my bumper mounts and was just starting to
feel good about it, when....

I opened the engine hatch after a short drive, only to
find *both* my coil and carb LEAKING FLUID!!!

The coil is a 2-year old Bosch blue coil and the fluid
leaking from it is clear, oily, and odorless. I can
only assume it's shot, right??? I thought these things
were supposed to last longer than 2 years!

The carb...is a *POS* Brosol 30/31 and it *appears* to
be leaking from the throttle shaft in a fairly steady
drip (one about every 30 seconds). So I find myself in
search of a carb, too.

Damn it all! I can't afford this right now. Not only
that, but I gotta drive it as is, since it's the only
car and we live in a town with zero mass-transit (I
know, I know...I won't let it burn up). At least it's
all short distance driving.

Anyone have a good, rebuildable 30/31 (or similar)
they'd sell for a reasonable price....sooooooon?????


As usual, any and all help will be greatly appreciated.
