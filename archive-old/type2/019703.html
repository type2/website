See if the knocking goes away as you pull each spark plug wire from the
distributor cap in turn with the engine running.  If knocking goes away, that
particular rod is knocking .  If knocking does not go away, think callapsed
lifter or main bearing knock , or ???

I chased lifters until I replaced all 8, then remembered the spark technique
and found my knock.

&gt;  Well heres were my
&gt; problem occured, the van has been sitting a few weeks

Maybe a lifter needs to pump up.

&gt;  it sounded horribble a very loud knocking
&gt; sound . It made noise in the
&gt; past at start up but quite very quickly within a
&gt; minute
&gt; as oil pressure built up.
