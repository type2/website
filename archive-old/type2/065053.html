Subject: '80 Factory Cal Look

One of my '80 Westi's is a factory made Cal Look bus.

There is no indication on the VIN that would distinguish it from a 
standard '80.  How do I know it is a factory job, not an aftermarket?
They are not painted over chrome, the trim up the gutter in front of the 
door is black, the bumper does not have the black rubber trim
across the center and does not have the holes for the rubber, a large 
exposed black headed bolt is used to hold the bumper to the bracket,
all the standard window rubbers are all black, no chrome accent, the
round exposed hinge thingy on the slider is black &amp; not same color as
the bus. Most of these would be $$ to do except in production.

Questions I am in search of answers for:

How many Cal Looks are there out there?
Limited to Westi's?
How many were made?
How many regular '80's were made?
Any Cal Looks made in '81, '82 etc?
What is the paint code for the black paint?
(Hah, I knew you were waiting for a paint code question)
