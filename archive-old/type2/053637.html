Subject: Re: Porsche engine in van

&gt; i was wondering if a Porsche engine would fit in to a 1975 VW van,
&gt; without alot of modifacations.

914 or 911?
914 long-block will fit with only *very* minor mods. If it's a 2 liter, keep
in mind that your '75 FI system is calibrated to 1.8 liters.
911 fits too, but requires a moderate amount of work. I put one in my '75,
you can read all about it on my web site. Also search the type2_dot_com
archives!
