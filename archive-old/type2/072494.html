I have one of those switches with what looks like an eye lens with lines radiating out of it.....what is this thing for??? Maybe it is for the heater???

I have an adjustable switch on my dash between the headlight switch and the steering column that I'm not sure what it is for because it isn't doing anything currently.  Is it for the heater blower that my van is missing?  Or what? The PO really did a piece of work on this bus but I love it anyway.  
Thanks.
