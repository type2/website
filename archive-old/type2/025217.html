In an attempt to further facilitate bookmarking and posting to the list,
I've changed the URL of the archives.

  http://vw.i405_dot_com/

Will now directly take you to the VW type2 archives.  The &quot;Complex Search&quot;
is now the default search.  This search allows complex searches but takes a
little time to learn.

Sample0:  apple pie lake
     == you will NOT get a hit, because this is searching for the phrase
&quot;apple pie swim&quot;.  If you search for &quot;apple AND pie AND lake&quot; or &quot;apple pie
AND lake&quot; you will get hits.

Sample1:   yok* NEAR schwab
     == this search will search for all words starting with the three
letters &quot;Yok&quot; (wildcard word).  The NEAR search is similar to an AND search
but it will return results in rank order based on things like how many times
the word appears and how close the two are together in the same document.

Sample2:  brake AND convert**
    ==  In this case, &quot;convert**&quot; will match all standard English variations
of the word convert.  &quot;Conversion&quot; &quot;Converted&quot; and so forth.

Note that double asterisk searches ( sample2 ) are not smart about car
terminology.  I am trying to figure out a way to enhance it, but for NOW
don't assume it knows our slang.  ((I doubt &quot;Dizzy&quot; is considered a standard
variation of &quot;Distributor&quot; &lt;grin&gt;.))

Anyone who has links to the archives, please change them to the new URL.
