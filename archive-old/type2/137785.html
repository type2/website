Subject: Re: [T2] 55 mph speed limit

Well, you do raise some valid points here, Mark. I certainly find it
frustrating when I cannot keep up with others in non-VW activities,
especially hill climbing (and fast descents on winding freeways as
well), but I'm looking at a 75 owner's manual here that states that
the top speed is 79 mph for manual tranny and 74 mph for automatic.

So I think limiting to 65 is too conservative. I easily maintain 75 in
my '72 which has a '79 2.0 and weber progressive. 80 and 85 bursts
have been done too on brief passing situations. (Don't tell the CHP
;-)

 Just a reminder to many on the list, and a genuine &quot;heads up&quot; to
 younger listees, that when FI buses were produced for the American
 market, the 55 mph speed limit was the law of the land, and was
 rigorously enforced in most parts of the country (states were
 threatened with loss of DOT funds if they did not enforce the speed
 limit).
 
 I have no doubt that VW engineers provided some marginal performance
 characteristics in their design specifications for higher speeds (for
 passing, etc.). But our buses (74 and later) were not designed for
 sustained highway speeds of 65 mph, much less the 80 mph that is
 standard on California freeways.
 
 They were definitely not designed to keep up with today's overpowered
 vehicles.
