&gt;  &gt;From 73 to 79, the front side marker bulb is in the upper turn signal unit. The turn signal has 2 bulbs in
&gt; it. A little bulb on the outside edge and a large bulb for the turn signal/flasher. Most are burned out and
&gt; people never knew they were there. #2 in this pic:

&gt; &gt; not in the USA, here the only thing in the housing is a dual filiment
&gt;  light bulb, one is the marker/running light and the other the turn
&gt;  flasher.  the little bulbs are the &quot;city&quot; lights never used in the USA

&gt; Sorry Bob, you have it backwards. You need to remove the lens from any USA bus and look. You will see the
&gt; little bulb for the side marker. Federal law required the side marker light. It is in EVERY USA front 73-79
&gt; light. Euro lights did not have the little bulb.

well since the running filament was burned out on one of the lights it
gave me an excuse to go look.

&gt; Yes, the large bulb is a dual dual filament; it is the park light and the turn signal.
&gt; Look at the 77/78 wiring diagram in the Bentley. M11 at location 31 and 32. The wires for them come from M1
&gt; and M3.

WELL I'LL BE  hornswaggled!!!! learn something new on this list every day,
wonder how I ever kept my old buses running before they invented the
internet??
 &gt; 
&gt; Like I said, MOST are burned out and people don't even know they are there!

mine weren't there, but the sockets for em surely were

thanks
Bob
