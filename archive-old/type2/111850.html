&gt; hey everyone,
&gt; i changed my oil w/ quakerstate 40w, and i simply
&gt; cleaned and reused the oil screen.. was this a good
&gt; idea?
&gt; 
&gt; how many times if at all can i reuse this badboy?
&gt; 
&gt; is quakerstate ok in an aircooled ride??
&gt; 
&gt;I don't know how many times you can reuse the oil
screen, I use them untill I can't get a good seal with
them or they look bad. The Quakerstate oil hummmm... I
used it 40 or so years ago in my race cars , found
that I got a lot of buildup(GUM)in and on everything,
I shifted to Havoline and haven't had any problems
with it, they may have corrected the problem by now.
