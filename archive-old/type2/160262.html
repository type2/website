Subject: Re: [T2] emissions

In response to:  &quot;Yet another reason I won't be moving there  
[California] anytime soon.  (Another is named Pelosi.)&quot;

The great thing is, you don't have to move at all to enjoy the  
benefits of having your circumstances improved by Ms. Pelosi - she  
has a National platform now.
