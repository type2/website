Subject: need help w/front end noise
Date: Mon, 28 Dec 1998 12:48:01 -0500

The bus in question is a 69.

Coming home from a 150 mile drive I noticed a strange noise as I exited the
hwy. A kind of clattery rumble that was metallic in origin. It happened when
I turned to the right. I paid careful attention to it the rest of the way
home and made the following observations: the sound is coming from the right
front, it only occurs when I turn to the right and it happens in forward and
reverse.

Conventional wisdom has it that a right front wheel bearing will make itself
known when you turn to the left. So for arguments sake I will rule that out.
I checked the roadweels and the lugnuts are on tightly so that is out.

I am coming to you because any work done on the bus this week will have to
be done at night, in the rain ,in the driveway by flashlight (usual MO.)
What should I be looking for? Any ideas to help narrow down the search for
the right red herring will be helpful.

Thanks
Chris
