David,

    I have ordered some hard to get materials from TMI before. Their number
is 1-800-624-7960. If you have a small example to send them, it may help.
Ask for &quot;Rico&quot; and tell him I sent you, if he dosen't hang up on you he will
help. ;-) Also he should be able to recommend someone if he can't help.
