Subject: Re: [T2] oil level Quandry

&gt; i know that too much oil is bad so when i noticed that
&gt; the leve on my newly aquired single port 1600 1969
&gt; stock engine wass above the full mark i drained some
&gt; out then 2 days later checked again and it was high
&gt; so i drained out some more checked the next day high
&gt; again    i'm not draining anymore
&gt; what's the capacity anyway like 2.5 Q  i've drained
&gt; about 1.

Mike
i suspect your carb or maybe fuel pump is leaking gas into the crankcase.
smell the oil. gassy right? Has it been hard to start, like flooded? that
would indicate a leaking float valve.
