Subject: re beds on &quot;first floor&quot; of Westy:

Ken mentioned that other than 2 adults in the seat/bed, one can sleep 3
children using the floor by the sliding door, and the walkthru for a
toddler as well as the door to door cot...actually (in a 78) you can
sleep a near adult to boot if you add a bedboard with foam resting on
the edge of the rear bed and also resting on the front turned seatbed
with the garbage box/seat shimming it to level!
