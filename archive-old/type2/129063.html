Subject: Re: [T2] SVDA question

Well, the interesting thing about that is with the vacuum line 
disconnected, the advance will only go up to 32 or somewhere around 
there.  Put the hose back on, it'll bump up even higher.  So it does 
seem to have some effect at both off-idle and other high-vacuum events...

&gt; Proper vacuum advance is only present from off-idle to 1/2 throttle. Above
&gt; 1/2 throttle vacuum advance is 0 and you have centrifugal only, which is the
&gt; same as a 009. This is why a properly setup SVDA will outperform a 009 in
&gt; ALL circumstances, because the worst it does is a 009 curve (1/2 to full
&gt; throttle).
