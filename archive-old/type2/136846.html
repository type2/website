&gt; Has anyone seen an oil drain plug that had an allen wrench hole in it?

&gt; during future oil changes I can get it out with an opened-ended or

That is the proper plug for a '79 :-)  I think some '78s have that 
style of plug, as well.

Just get a socket with the proper allen key on it, and use a ratchet to 
loosen it.
