Subject: More on gas leaks

I have been keeping up with the latest postings on gas leaks, but mine
seems a little different than all those others.  The leak I have is
noticed only when filling the tank.  It leaks from somewhere between the
gas cap and the tank, and leaks down the inside of the outer body panel,
if that makes any sense.  It DOES NOT leak into the engine compartment,
which is a great thing.  I've only seen gas actually drip out twice, bith
times after a fill up and I was on  hill.

I notice a gas smell after fill up, even if only putting a small amount of
gas in.  I notice a small wet spot on the body about three feet below the
filler cap-the spot is the size of a quarter (for you enlightened non-US
metric users, about 2 cm).  There is no drip on the outside leading to
this spot, so it must be on the inside.

I can't seem to get to the filler neck to check it out.  How do I do that?
My Haynes manual is useless in this case.  Anyone had this happen to their
bus?  The fuel-return cooling tubes don't seem to be the problem, and I
can't get to where I think it is leaking.

I noticed the other posts about leaks seem to involve engine compartment
leaks, and I don' htink this is the same kind of leak.

Thanks,
Craig
