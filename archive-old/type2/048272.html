Subject: [T2] re: horn sound

&gt;There's no such thing as &quot;the Volkswagen horn sound&quot;.
&gt;They used generic single-tone horns, AFAICT from a variety
&gt;of manufacturers even, and the ones I've heard sound all
&gt;differently.

I disagree.  VW horns do sound different.  I am tone deaf and can tell if it 
is a VW horn or not.  There is a guy that lives in my town that has a pretty 
interesting talent.  He can tell you the make, model and year of your 
vehicle by the sound of the horn.  Over the phone or in person.  I have 
heard him many times guess and the worst he was ever off was by a couple 
years, but he always guessed the make and model.

Peace Brother,
