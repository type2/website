Use screwdrivers for screws, not the Hall shield.

Go to your FLAPS and buy one of those $1 battery cable pullers. Looks like a
little gear puller. Go to your bench grinder and grind down the hooks on the
bottom. Straight across so the hook is about 3/16&quot; thick. Grind the sides so
the hooks just fit in the square holes. Put a penny on top of the dist.
shaft. Tighten the puller, watch the shield slide right up. DON'T loose the
little round pin! Be very careful with the 3 wires on the coil. If you break
them, an early Rabbit one will work. [later Rabbits have a square plug]

You don't need to remove the shield or the coil to change the advance unit.
It unhooks off the bottom of the advance plate. If the plate is sticking,
remove the vacuum unit and spare the plate with Liquid Wrench etc. Not
WD40....


&gt; I was speaking with H. Steve (Hi H.!) this evening and we both agreed
&gt; that the shield should slide up off. The Bently shows two screwdrivers
&gt; walking it off of the shaft, but I pushed on them kinda hard and it
&gt; did not budge.
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone else done this? Am I missing somthing, should I push
&gt; harder, what will help? I wiggled and tried to rock the unit
&gt; back and forth but it did not budge .001 inch.
