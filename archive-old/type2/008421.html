Hi Volks,

Mike Gensler wrote to the List:
&gt; I always assumed Jalousie meant Louvered in
&gt; German.  I gained this assumption from my &quot;VW-Campingmobile 67&quot;
manual that
&gt; obviously was written for the 1968 model since it clearly shows a
loaf bus
&gt; on the cover and subsequent pages.  
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, the manual is written in both English and German and on page
7 it
&gt; says in English, &quot;The Campmobile 67 is equipped with two louvered
&gt; windows...&quot; and just under it in German it says, &quot;Das Campmobile 67
ist mit
&gt; zwei Jalousie-Fenstern versehen...&quot;.  Thus my assumption.  Any
&gt; German-speaking busers (B.S. ers?) out there who know?

While &quot;louvered window&quot; does mean &quot;Jalousiefenster&quot;, &quot;Jalousie&quot; does
not really mean &quot;louvered&quot;.  It does men &quot;louver&quot; apparently, but more
in the sense of something you hang on a window of a building.  Louvers
in a car would be &quot;Lüftungsschlitze&quot;, literally &quot;ventilation slots&quot;,
which we'd never call a Jalousie.  Seems a camper window is more to do
with a house than a car.

ObBusContent: Yay!  I scored a long-wood trailer, original accessory
for VW pick-ups.  It's for carrying tree-trunks with a length of
between 4 and 10 yards.  Telephone poles too.  Can't wait to buy that
'71 single cab now.  That'll be an awesome sight...

The trailer's a '66, with wide-five lug rims and round hubcaps, but i
have a copy of a dealer handbook from '76 showing it unchanged, so i
don't need a Split SC (rare here).  Oops!  Steve, will this mention of
a pre-67 bus get me removed and banned? ;-)))  Pictures (and scans
from that handbook) will be delivered later, don't panic.  :-)  

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.

&quot;You mean there's such a thing as a VW Bus with rear side windows?&quot;
