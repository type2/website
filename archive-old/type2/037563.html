Subject: Several Questions

Hello all,
  I was out working on my 74 kombi this weekend and now
have some questons. 
  On the stock air cleaner set-up there is a flapper
valve
that directs hot air from under the engine ito the
aircleaner or cool air. The cool air hose is gone, what
did
it look like and where did it go to? I see there are
small
brackets above the battery, did the hose clamp on to
there
somehow? What size hose is it?
  Same air cleaner, the small valve that directs vacuum
to
the valve, which hose goes to the flapper valve and where
does the other one go? Where does it get is vacuum? There
are two nipples that come out, one black plastic, the
other
brass.
  The evap. canister, where do the hoses go on that
thing.
I would like to hook it up, but all the hoses are
disconected. The can has one end with a big hose and a
small hose, the other has one big one. The air cleaner
has
two big hoses coming out of the center box, and the fan
shroud has a big hose fitting too, whats up?
   The heat sheild above the muffler, should I have one
if
I am running an Exstractor type muffler? Mine is missing
and I don't want to install one if it won't gain
anything,
but want it if I need it.
  One more. The small lines that go across the top of the
engine bay from side to side, they meet in the middle
into
a 'T' connector. The 'T' is bad and there is nothing
connected to it, where does it go?
   I have looked in the Library, Bently and in Haynes. I
could not find any good diagrams of the hose routing. Any
web sites with good pictures?
  I may have more, I am getting this thing ready to go on
a
long trip and want it to be as right as possible.
