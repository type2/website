Subject: For sale Atlanta 69 camper

A client came in today to report a bus he saw in Atlanta. He did not talk to 
the owner. Sign said runs great, new brakes. The guy looked trough the window 
and said the inside looked OK. His words: &quot;Body is shot&quot;

404-299-2396

You know what I know. No personal interest, etc.... Let me know if you go to 
look.
