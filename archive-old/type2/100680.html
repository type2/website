Subject: RE: [T2] Goodies from Europe!  (Finally!)

&gt; According to John's page, these poles are 1&quot; shorter than the original
&gt; '69-73 poles, so to use them on those years you might have to
&gt; fabricate a spacer, or simply relocate your brackets slightly lower so
&gt; they're in the  same location as on the later busses.
&gt;  (Of course the canvas is the same in all cases, only the poles differ.)


&gt; A little error here:
&gt; 74/75 are 1&quot; LONGER than 68-73.



Sorry, you're right, I got it backwards. So you'd have to RAISE the mounts
slightly on your A pillars to use these poles on a 69-73 bus, not lower
them.
