Subject: Re: Ignition Switch Problems

&gt; So I'm thinking it's the ignition switch. Any thoughts on this? Anyone have any
&gt; ideas to help me? Anyone have an ignition switch or connections to get one
&gt; because no one sells them. Any advise would be great. Keep on bussin'.

Check the ignition switch.  Mine just went out and I pulled out most of my
hair trying to figure out what was wrong.  finally I gave up and took it
in to be fixed.  The switch was only 20 dollars and now it runs great.
