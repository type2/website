Subject: Small Bone Yard find


Hi ya Volks!

Found a couple a bone yards yesterday picked up an instrument panel (With a 
Clock!)and a 2nd jump seat to modify and place on the right side.  Anybody 
ever done this and could share any pointers learned from experience? Any one 
else think $30 too much for these items?

Thought I'd share what else I found that others might want.
1. a Z-bed (no rear cushion for hatch bay though)
2. Two sets of louvered windows
3. one set of screens for louvered windows.
4. Front cab bench seats (Joy?)
5. Full width rear bench seat.
6. A '70 Westy missing Jump seat, main table, Sink/Icebox.  A definite fixer 
upper but a fairly solid body and surface rust from 15yrs sitting there. 
looks like somebody might have shot the slideing door?! (I didn't take 
anything from this one because it's too close to drivability.)

The parts listed are from three busses in one bone yard the '70 in another 
located near Landrum SC, the first exit off I26 from NC.

P.S. It is my intention of attending Everybus 2002, April 19,20 &amp; 21
     and possibly save some shipping and handling expence.

P-Mail me if I can help ya find these or help negotiate.
