A vw mechanic friend of mine has a 45(46?).  It is all restored though. 
It has the body of a beetle and the pan/suspension of a kubblewagon
(Sp?).  It is painted a military green and has British numbers painted
on the hood to signify its ownership by the British military.  This same
mechanic (der volks werks in Santa Barbara CA) has a schwimwagen which
is in the process of being restored.
