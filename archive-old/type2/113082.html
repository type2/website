Subject: cam gear numbers - anyone?!

Does nobody know about cam gear numbers?  I know many of you have put 
new cams in your engines.  There's gotta be someone out there that knows 
about cam numbering.  This is a completely stock rebuild, so I'm not 
doing anything fancy here... more info below.

thanks,
Mike

&gt; something I need to look into for my 78 rebuild?  I don't see any number 
&gt; (+-9) on my cam gear, and webcam didn't make any mention of it when I 
&gt; bought my new gear.

&gt; thanks,
