Subject: Official VW service manuals

Just picked up some interesting VW Publication service manuals. One is &quot;1960
through 1970 without guesswork&quot; which gives &quot;...all major measurements and
adjustments for Type1, 2, and 3 Volkswagens imported into the USA and Canada
from 1960 through 1970.&quot; Another is a trouble shooting guide for the BA4 Gas
Heater. Next is an AFC Fuel Injection troubleshooting guide for 1976. Also
got service manuals and service bulletins up to 69.

If anyone has questions about specs or measurements let me know and I will
be glad to see if I have it in the mound of stuff I got. TBear

Don't take life to seriously--You'll never live through it.
1971 Westy (Goldie)
1956 Oval (BugOff II)
