Subject: help, where does that hose come from
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Normally I can put things back together the way they're supposed to be but
now I have a problem.

It's on a 1600 DP, carburettor with paper type air filter.

I took the air filter off. It has three thin hoses. Two on the forward (cab)
side and one on the rear. Now when putting it back together I cannot find
where one of the hoses has to connect. The rear most (closest to lid, a more
or less clear plastic hose) goes to a couple of tubes against the engine
compartment ceiling. The forward one (black braided) goes to the
carburattor.

Then there is the middle one (red braided) that I cannot match to anything.
My Haynes and Bentley do not clearly show this setup so they are of no help.
Does anyone know (or can check their engine) where this hose has to go?

NOTE: I don't mean the thick rubber hose that goes next to the oil filler.

I hope someone knows what I mean.

TIA
