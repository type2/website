Subject: fixing tail light problem

I just spent some time replacing a main harness, (along with a FI harness) for
a customer and had an interesting problem and solution come up. When I went
through and checked the tail lights and such, I found that all the lights
(turn, backup ect) would come on dim when I turn on a directional. It turned
out to be a bad ground. The metal ground tabs on the body where all but
falling off. Rather than change out the female connectors for the round style
and drilling a hole for a sheet metal screw, I went to a local electronics
store and found the little stock style male spade connectors. They where two
connectors at a 45 degree bend with a hole in the middle. Perfect for a little
spot weld or a screw. I ground the old ones flat and smooth then attached the
new ones in there place, slide on the connectors and perfecto. Clean crisp
turn signals and stock style grounds in the engine compartment. These things
where only 8 cents and I for sure got a few for future jobs. I know not every
town has great electronics stores so let me know if you need any.

I try and keep things stock, this was a challange but once again doable
