Subject: 3rd Gear grinding Sound and Radio Install and Brakes

&gt;From the Frozen Tundra, where men resemble their surroundings....

I am driving my van (75 Deluxe) daily now, have been since purchasing a few
weeks ago, and I am noticing a few things.  
1) When I shift from 2nd to 3rd, there is a slight grind noise, like I tried
to do it without the clutch.  If I wait till the rpm's drop quite a bit (I
have no tach) it doesn't grind, but none of the other gears do this.  I read
the post about shifting linkage and possibly one of Rev. Bob's homiletic
prizes on shifting, and nothing was really mentioned about this.  Any clues?
 I just put in a new clutch cable, but it was doing this before I did that.
 (my old one broke)

2) How does one know when the brakes need to be &quot;done&quot; or adjusted or
whatever.  I am fairly clueless on this, there is however a funky sound,
kinda like a whoosh when I brake, not loud or scraping.  Is that normal for a
bus?  they also feel maybe a little soft, for sure softer than my wife's car,
but then... Duh!     Is there a good place to go for this info before X-mas?
 I am hoping my Christmas will be like the very first one, with gold,
frankensense, and MUIR.  Bentley can come too, but I am not sure if I am
ready for it.  

3.  Radio install.  is there a wise place to hook in for the Main power, the
backup power, and well... that's all i guess.  I just want to know a smart
place to hook in.  Right under the fuse on one of the connectors?  tap into a
wire?  

thanks all.   Thanks too for the concern for the Buses here in South Dakota
(Lacey's) makes me feel a little less alone.
