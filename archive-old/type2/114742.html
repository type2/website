Subject: Re: [T2] Belly Pan?

The bus depot has them in their catalog for $39.95, but I can't find them on their website.  Probably worth giving them a call.

VW auto salvage place would be a good bet too.  You may want to try: http://www.wayoutsalvage_dot_com/.  I've never ordered from them personally so can't vouch for service/quality.

Mine was stuck in the back of a parts bus I got for free.  After banging out some of the dents and applying some por 15 it came out quite nicely.

&lt;What the hell...does anyone know of a place where I&gt;
&lt;could get one, as i've never come across one in all of&gt;
&lt;my parts searching in the past.  A used one is fine, I&gt;
&lt;can always clean it and such, just not rusty.&gt;
