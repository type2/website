&gt; Anyone have a clue as to the story behind this bus?

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I not interested in it at all, but thought you all would get a kick out of
&gt; it :)

As a number have already said, it's obviously a Brazilian DC ( the giveaways 
would be the Type1 engine &amp; Split style spare tyre storage behind teh front 
seat, resulting in the bulge at the back of the bulkhead ).

Really wish I could get my hands on those bumpers for my project DC, though, 
don't s'pose anyone has a spare set of Brazilian bumpers laying around, have 
they? ;^)
