Subject: Re: [T2] Q about inspecting a new engine after assembly

Don,

Looks pretty good to me!

I would verify the endplay and flywheel nut tightness.

Flywheel end play sets everything, the rear pulley just sits there.

Got the right pulley?...looks like you have a sand seal in there.

Double check the valve train geometry although the pic you had looks 
pretty good.....rockers line up &quot;correctly&quot; on the valve stems in the 
vertical plane?

Rockers square with stems at half lift in the horizontal plane?

Got the right stuff to add a filter for the full flow?

Will your tin under the pulley fit correctly and not rub the pulley with 
the full flow fitting in there?(with hose and clamp on it?)

*Forget* the flash....mist, I said *mist* the cylinders and the heads with 
bbq paint....always good for about 15 degrees less temps.

Double check tightness of the oil pickup tube and the studs that hold the 
sump plate on while it is easy to get to.

Cheers, dave
