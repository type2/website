Hi Folks,
   Can anyone tell me the diameter of the bolts that hold on the pan under 
the front of the bus.  You know, the pan under the pedal area.  Half of my 
bolts broke when I took them out for the first time on this bus.  A 5mm 
seems too small and a 6mm seems to big and none of the local flaps or 
hardware stores have a 5.something mm bolt.  I guess I could tap out the 
holes to a 6.  I'd rather stick with the proper size and the first step is 
to find out what that size is.
  So if you know what the size is, how about sharing the info.
Thanks in advance for the help I'm sure will come my way.
