Subject: 3 Free Worn CV joints

Hi folks,

I've been cleaning out my work area and came across 3 CV joints (68-79 bus)
that I've been keeping as emergency spares.  They are really worn, but the
cages aren't broke and the balls aren't pitted.  The grooves in which the
ball travels are worn in both directions, meaning someone reversed their
travel direction in the past so they've lead a long life.  In other words, I
should really throw these out, but I'm a packrat who keeps various
grades/degrees of spares &quot;just in case&quot;.

I notice every now and then someone has a need for a joint (CV), but doesn't
have the $$ to buy new. These should work for those temporary emergency
situations.  

Take one or take all, you pay shipping, of course.
