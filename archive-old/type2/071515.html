OK, OK, I've given up on my engine.  I'm a beginner VW backyard mechanic that has been trying to get my 78 cali. emission bus running.  Yesterday I gave up, I didn't sell the bus but i swapped engines.  The original engine was FI with electronic egnition, the engine I just put is a single two stage carb.  1st problem, how do i by pass the combi relay? If i need to all?  2, do I need to add a relay into the electrical system before the solenoid.  The reason I ask about the relay is because the bus i removed the engine from had a relay, of some sort wired in before the solenoid.  3, which wires go on which terminal of the solenoid?  I have the engine in and the electrical connected.  I thought it was correct but when i turn the key the starter spins but will not engage?  the starter worked in the original bus?  Please help.  Please..

P.S. Thanks for your time, Mike Q
