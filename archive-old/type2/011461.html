Subject: rich remedy?
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id XAA05847

specs:

1800cc type4 in a 74 bus
73 model case
74 model heads/p&amp;c
Dometop pitons
2bbl weber/ 009
Facet electric pump
Stock 76 model exhaust system- leaking patches at rusted crossover pipe
(imagine that)

List,
Couldn't seem to find this directly addressed in the archives in the time i
have available.
I am assuming the little bits of wet soot being spit out of the tailpipe at
idle are unburnt hydrocarbons which means i'm running rich.

A local hot-rod tinker-er suggested installing a less restrictive exhaust
system would help to remedy this.

Questions:
1. Am i running too rich?
1. Will a less restrictive exhaust cure it?
2. Is this system http://www.motorworks_dot_com/images/p13172B.JPG less
restrictive than a stock system?
3. Isn't running a little rich OK  in a vw - esp on a type4?

thanks for any and all replies,

clark in KY.
