Subject: Re: [T2] oil filters and oil

I use quaker state 20w50. I read all the reports on
oil chemistry relative to air-cooled vw engines, and
quaker I think had slightly more favorable chemical
additive percentages. Castrol may have looked good
also in that regard, but there was a rumor circulating
a few years ago that castrol was causing premature
cam-shaft wear in newly rebuilt air-coolers...seemed
unlikely to me, but I had just spent about a year on
the rebuild so I got paranoid and took a break from
castrol for a while....
