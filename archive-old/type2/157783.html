Subject: Re: [T2] Front Door Locks

I use LPS #1. It drys grease-free and non-sticky and
it also displaces water. I just stick the spray tube
in the key slot and spray away - in the fall, when
we're liable to get rain followed by a freeze. It
amazes me ho much water gets in those door locks. I
also spray LPS1 on my door gaskets - hopefully before
any big freeze!

I don't like the banana smell of Tri-Flow and they
upset me years ago when the name of the company was
Tri-Flon. I sold it at my bicycle shop and I bought it
from my bicycle parts and components distributor who
was a licensed TriFlon distributor. I stopped selling
the product when I started receiving regular
phonecalls from the factory wanting to sell direct to
me for substantially less than the distributor could.
I told them that because they did not support their
distributor I would no longer sell their products. I
didn't like the banana smell anyway - I guess I
mentioned that...

When racing motcross (motorcycles now, not bicycles) I
used to demonstrate LPS 1 in this manner: I removed
the mag cover off one of the bikes and started it up.
I ran a garden hose into the mag as it was running.
The engine died instantly and would not restart. I
sprayed WD40 in there and on the points surfaces and
restarted the engine. Again I sprayed water in the mag
and the engine died instantly. I sprayed LPS1 in the
mag, restarted the engine and then sprayed the water
in the mag and the engine kept running!

Typical water-resistant treatment on the MX bike with
WD40 was every moto and sometimes that was not
adequate (MX in western Washington in winter!) LPS1
treatment lasted all winter.

I used it as chain lube for the BMX bikes also - when
we weren't using that banana smelling stuff. It's
great stuff but not readily available except at
industrial-oriented stores like the fleet oriented
FLAPS. -BaH

 I have had my 1977 Westy for 14 months, I have
 removed the front door locks (locks = cylinder + 
 latching mechanism) twice in this time and cleaned
 them up and had them working perfectly.
 
 Last time I put graphite on everything, the guy at
 the locksmith by my house said that we should not
 use graphite in the PNW, it works great in Arizona
 (he thinks he is funny and witty), they recommend
 some type of aerosol oil that they sell, I think it
 has &quot;triple&quot; in its name.
 
 At this point I need the wisdom of an experienced
 bus owner, how can I make the next time I pull the
 locks the last time in at least 10 years?
 
 Thank you,
