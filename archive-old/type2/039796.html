Subject: &quot;Holders&quot; in your Westy

All this talk of cupholders has led me to describe the myriad holders in
our MUCH used Westy, past and present.......this is long and shold go in
the archives like my spare bed descriptions!
Eyebolts, Screw eyes, velcro, clothspins/spring clips, suction cups,
bungee cords, toeclip straps, sash cord, soda bottles and spare
&quot;boxes&quot;/tubs and shelves  all are utilized in our Westy:
1. Eyebolts are used around the poptop to hold the bungees/ rope which
fasten anything from lumber to extra bikes up there.  I have 2&quot;
fenderwashers under them to spread the force- no cracks yet.  2 of them
(bent to form hookbolts) stick out above the rear hatch to hold the bike
rack or support the &quot;firewood&quot; box  shelf that bolts to the bumper.  I
also used them at the ends of the roof crossbar at the FRONT of the
T-nutted bedboard, facing down- to hold the chains that lift the seatbed
end up to create a rearfacing &quot;couch&quot; or provide protection for sleepers
in case of a collision.  At the front of the Westy, I added an eyebolt
on each side of the airscoop grill (goes through the body behind
it)...to hold the bikerack that slips over the sparetire.  The bike
bungees also fasten to these.  For our TV, I was going to use eyebolts
through the deluxe cabinet top to hold a bungee over the TV, but opted
to drill double holes to form rope loops to do the same.  I used
eyebolts in the roof above the sink in the 71 Westy to hold a 9&quot; tv that
had 2 eyebolts fastened to its handle, thus hanging it by a throughbolt.
2. Screweyes- useful in the board or cabinet over your head to hold
earphones or hang your watch or dry a towel. They hold my
potholder/carpet brush inside the Cabinet door. The are screwed into the
wooden strip along the poptop roof to hold sashcord upon which hangs the
drying beach towels!  The same (with a rope going beneath) will hold the
flipbed up to form a roof &quot;couch&quot; for the kids while giving you
headroom.
3.  Velcro- quickly replacing many of the other fasteners.  The &quot;Heavy
Duty&quot;HomeDepot kind that is self-sticking is great for holding anything
from curtain ends to fans to laptop computers to cup bottoms.  Cut a
liter soda bottle off at the top and stick a velcro strip to its
side...put the matching fuzz on the wall JUST ABOVE the flip bed
(passenger side) and you have a removable holder there.  Same for the
other side- put it on the cabinet wall. I use it on the rear window to
hold the curtain open enough for my fresnel wideangle lens.  Use it to
hold up the digital alarm or temperature gauge.  I have a flipup table
on the inside of the sliding door to which is glued velcro for the
laptop bottom or a food tray.  The portable CD player is velcroed to the
cabinet wall just left of the upper cabinet door.  The Sega (Genesis) is
velcroed to the wall of the sinkcabinet.  It's great to hold spare
curtains, such as the one between driver area and the rear.  I put some
outside above the windshield to hold the front curtain when it's a sun
shade (keeps the BTU's from entering).
4. Clothspins/springclips- indispensible for holding up towels or
fastening &quot;privacy&quot; curtains to our awning.  Can be ductaped to a
flashlight.
5. Suctioncups- the kind with a hook are neat to hang curtains in a
non-westy bus, and one holds our driver &quot;traffic&quot; fan to the windshield.
I glued 4&quot; square plexiglass to the sinktop to also hold rear-facing
fans.
6. Bungee cords- utilized with eyebolts to hold the potty behind the
passenger seat or the IceChest.  A separate one keeps the stool/garbage
can in place.  I have one in back that spans across the space when you
open up the rear hatch so my folding picnic table doesn't fall out. 
Their other uses are obvious....
7.  Toeclip straps- &quot;clipless &quot; bike pedals are making these scarce-
good for holding together poles; I screwed one to the roof above the
&quot;cot storage space&quot; to grip a folding umbrella and the poles for my
spare center bed.  Opposing velcro straps are also good for this.
8. Containers- My favorites are the square soybean oil plastic tubs
(about 8&quot; across)  you can get from a Chinese restaurant; they fit
perfectly under the rear seatbed to separate stuff like tools, bungees,
etc!  A 5 gallon spacklebucket fits perfectly to line the garbage stool
if you grind the top lip at opposite corners; inside this can go a 4
gallon bucket (catlitter one comes to mind) to carry water; the stock
pail fits inside this).  FWIW, the 22&quot; Sears truck toolboxes fit
perfectly in the sparetire well if you move it to the front.  I create
drawers out of sundry boxes to be able to reach to the rear of the
closet shelves or even the upper cabinet.  
9. Shelves-I can fit a road atlas FLAT inside our modified glovebox-
take out the box and make your own from cardboard lined with stickon
velvet- I ran a board from the front back over the freshair duct to
create a deep useful box!  -The underdash shelves with the mesh bottoms
hold a lot of stuff also.  -For those with later Westies, note that a
useful shelf can be slung between the rear closet and the top side of
the sinkcabinet- held our TV and VCR/Sega.  I first cut a new doorhole
for the rear cabinet facing the SIDE and walled over the old hole before
adding the shelf.  The fridge can still be accessed. For those with
earlier Westies, note that a shelf can be easily added between the front
seat rails; mine was removable in the 71, held by pions that slipped
into holes in the seat pedestal top.  The shelf consisted of a hinged
top with carpeting so you could step through- when it flipped up, it
revealed a shelf that had room for sundries like a CD player.- I also
had my CB radio mounted here facing up.  In the front of this was a
small extending shelf with 2 cupholders made by cutting a hole in the
shelf, then adding 6 smaller holes to hold string tied to form a
flexible cup beneath your drink.  I had a similar shelf in my bug. 
Under the shelf was a slideout drawer for more sundries.
10- Outside storage- I'm sure all know of my &quot;mailbox&quot; that fits in the
roofrack well, and I also have a large plastic (Sears) box that sits on
a shelf off my rear bumper- it's supported by chains from the bike rack
eyebolts and by boltholes drilled into a rightanble bracket hiding under
the bumper.  Goes on and off in 30 seconds.
