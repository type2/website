Subject: thinking of selling
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

i hate to do it, but i'm thinking of selling my '71 westy. It's a 
great bus, but it's just totally impractical as a primary car in 
Boston. parking is bad enough if you're in a sub-compact, but at 
least they have the option of using a parking garage. in the winter, 
it's so cold in the bus, i don't even really drive it - i just go out 
every week and start her up for a little while, maybe take her out 
for a spin on warm days. i can't shake the aircooled thing, though, 
and i've got my eye on a couple of possibilities - a pristine '67 
convertible ghia, and a friend's '73 superbeetle. at least they have 
heat and parallel parking on Mass. Ave isn't a total nightmare.

this one only has some minor surface rust under the tail of the 
poptop, and a small spot under the windshield. [oh, and some on the 
vent grill as well]. all of it seems to be easily fixable. It's 
originally from So. Cal then Arizona, and it drove me back east when 
i bought it two summers ago. the engine has performed flawlessly. A 
year and a half ago, i completely gutted it and lined the whole thing 
with rubber, insulated it, and installed new carpeting. the interior 
panels were all replaced with 1/8&quot; mahogany plywood, too. i've 
replaced some of the rubber, but have been holding off on doing the 
rest because i've been planning a paint job for a while. didn't make 
sense to replace anything until then. in the mean time, i've been 
buying rubber kits so i'm ready [windshield, louvered windows, etc]. 
front brakes and all 4 tires have about 10-15k on them. I paid about 
$3500 for it, including the tires and brake work, and i've probably 
put about $800-$1000 in on top of that.

so, i'm wondering what a bus like this is worth in New England these 
days - there don't seem to be many on ebay, and the Want Advertiser 
is not a great place to look since prices tend to be really 
unrealistic. i still haven't convinced myself 100% that i should sell 
it [parting with my VW's has always been tough], so seeing some 
numbers may help me make a decision.
