&gt; My 1600 DP engine, all stock, has a bad odor. When I come to the top of a
&gt;  hill or if I need to slow down just by lifting my foot from the gaz pedal, 
a
&gt;  smell of fuel and oil comes from the heat ducts. The 2 heat box are old but
&gt;  tight. It never smell when the engine is propulsing me. Just when I slow
&gt;  down, on the compression.
&gt;  
&gt;  I cant find why!! Rings, exhaust, heads. The 2 differences are Trottle
&gt;  closed and wheels driving the engine.
&gt;  
&gt;  Des idées? Any clues?

Hi Luc,

You have to remember that the air which is comes out of the heater vents is 
pushed there by the fan in the fan housing; so ANY oil / fuel contamination 
in the engine compartment will result in smells in the engine compartment.

IF I were a betting man then I would put my money on the smell of oil coming 
from a leaking (or badly fitting) crank case breather pipe - while using the 
throttle fumes will be sucked through the carb (via the air cleaner) but with 
the throttle closed a leaking breather tube will let fumes into the engine 
compartment and therefore into the heater system.

Good Luck
