&gt;Hey now busmates,
&gt;My bus is a 72, recently I purchased a doner bus also a 72.  When I dropped
&gt;the motor out of the doner I noticed the heat exchangers from the doner bus
&gt;are much smaller than the stock heat exchangers that came on my bus.  Can
&gt;anyone shed some light on why there is such a difference.  The smaller set
&gt;defintely will fit on my bus but why is the body of the exchanger so much
&gt;smaller on this set?

They are most likely type IV heat exchangers.  I ran a set on my bus for a
while.  They are much lighter and therefore easier on the exhaust studs but
they don't exchange heat as well as the bus exchangers because they lack
the fins that are in the bus exchangers.  They also require different
heater pipes and engine tin.
