&gt; I consider myself very fortunate (thanks Tobin!) to have acquired a
&gt; BA-6 Eberspacher gas heater, albeit with a few missing parts and in
&gt; unknown operating condition.  Since these things were regularly installed
&gt; in Canadian-bound type 2s, I've tried to locate parts and service stations
&gt; in Canada to no avail.  JB's got a few parts in Castle Rock, CO but he's
&gt; much more into the Stewart Warner burners.  
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone help out with parts sources and/or repair persons here??  I know 

There's a place in North Vancouver called &quot;Beetle Spa&quot; that works on the 
gas heaters.  The head guy is Peter, and he gives first-class service.

One work of caution:  The glow-plugs cost about $80.00 (can), and they're 
the cheapest part on the thing.
