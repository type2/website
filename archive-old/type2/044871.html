If it needs a paint job to make it look good, then try a gallon of brush on house paint.  Try a 'polite' color like white or something.  We did that to an old Nisson pickup that had more rust than not.  It was amazing how good it looked afterwards.

Also, someone I knew was going to have his car repoed, so he used large chains to chain his motorcycle to the front.  Try substituting a large tree if need be.

Good luck.
