Subject: Colortune
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

I found this on a carb. related writeup on the net. It was
a MG site but I was wondering if any of you had ever heard
of this device or used one on a bus??

If you have a ColorTune, you simply install it in place of
one of the plugs, then adjust the carburetor that feeds
that cylinder (the front carburetor for 1 &amp; 2, the rear for
3 &amp; 4). The
ColorTune will let you see the color of the flame. White
flashes mean too lean; yellow flame means too rich. Blue
(like a Bunsen burner) is correct, and blue with a faint
orangish tinge is
the best for power.
