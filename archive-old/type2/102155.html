Subject: Re: A revision of a brief question...

I asked the guy about retorking the heads but he said that I couldn't 
because of these metal gaskets.  He did say they weren't really gaskets 
per say, but some metal, possibly shims, that had blown through.  I got 
this bus shipped here from a used car lot in Cal. It was in 5 year old 
car shape with less then 100,000 miles on it.  The engine has never been 
rebuilt so any thing factory is still that way.  I also am not sure the 
guy said to replace the gasket, it could be just to remove them.  The 
cylinders can not be retorked while these are there.

&gt;&gt;My wife posted the last post.  I am sorry if

&gt;this post offended you.  
&gt;
&gt;I'm sorry about the tone of my last post to the
&gt;net, the one to which your wife responded.  What
&gt;I'm trying to tell you is that I've had these
&gt;things for twenty years.  I've rebuilt engines,
&gt;though I'm no mechanic, and I've seen many busses
&gt;with heads that need retorqued.  
&gt;
&gt;The symptoms you describe, leak at high temp and
&gt;especially at high rpm are also the symptoms of
&gt;the head studs not being torqued enough. 
&gt;(Unfortunately, it is also the signs of a head
&gt;stud pulling loose from the case, a fairly common
&gt;problem, and a crack in the head, also fairly
&gt;common, or crack in a cylinder wall, a little
&gt;less common.)  If there is a crack in the mating
&gt;surface between the cyl's and the head, or in the
&gt;old style factory cyl head, you should see
&gt;evidence of it.  Combustion byproducts, unburnt
&gt;gas and all, on the head/cyl area in question.  
&gt;
&gt;I've yet to see a T4 (pancake/Porsche 914 style,
&gt;whatever) engine like yours that had these shims.
&gt; In the 70's, VW recommended not using these. 
&gt;Again, the new style shims (that BD is calling a
&gt;cylinder head) does not seal, even if they are
&gt;installed on your engine.  Many if not all
&gt;refutable, knowledge engine rebuilders say not to
&gt;use the shims at all.  Like I said, I've never
&gt;seen one that still had these on the engine.  It
&gt;seals better without them apparently.  
&gt;
&gt;I am sure the labor rate in NJ is high.  I just
&gt;don't want you guys paying to have the engine
&gt;removed, heads removed, then the &quot;cyl head
&gt;gasket&quot; replaced--whether the mechanic actually
&gt;does it or not-- when all you need is the heads
&gt;retorqed.  
&gt;
&gt;Happy bussing, folks,
&gt;Ray
