Subject: Home built Gas Analyzer. Any updates?

Someone on the list was going to check with some techy friends on the
viability of making a home-made exhaust analyzer. Imagine being able to
tune those multicarbs mixtures to perfection! Anyway, has anyone heard an
update about this? Does anyone have larger cranial capacity than me, and
knows how to use an aftermarket O2 sensor to create one? It would seem
that a digital meter and an O2 sensor suitably powered could be calibrated
to give you a decent idea of fuel air mix. Am I out to lunch with this
idea?
Regards,
Courtney
