Subject: Re: [T2] Brazilian VW Bus

&gt; My wife INSISTS that we buy a brand new Brazilian Volkswagen Bus. I told 
&gt; her I didn't think it was possible because they don't meet US safety and crash 
&gt; test ratings. Is there ANY to buy one and bring it over to the states? Even 
&gt; if it isn't legal to drive on the street, can I still bring one over? (and 
&gt; then maybe work something out in one of the states with more LAX registration 
&gt; laws?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!

You &quot;might&quot; be able to bring one into the country for &quot;display or show&quot;
purposes, but you'd never be able to register it for street use. It doesn't
come with a vehicle compliancy certificate certifying that it meets ALL
the rules and regs for the USA...Importing a legal car into the country is
difficult enough... ;-(
