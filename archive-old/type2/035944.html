Subject: On the road again: FI 1800 prob/fix recap

My bus is running fine; the moon is making a smiley face; and all is right
with the world!

For those following my saga, I recently installed a new 1800 AVP engine
into my bus. The 2.0 liter I built last year spat an oil galley plug and I
didn't trust the JBWeld repair/hack that I put in place. The 2.0 liter is
now relegated to spare/waiting-proper-fix status. Just before I pulled the
engine, some mysterious electrical boogosity caused the bus to stop running
for anything more than a few seconds.

After installing the 1800, I found the non-cranking problem still existed.
I noticed that the bus would idle indefinitely if I unplugged the AFM. This
was a familiar problem from last year, but I couldn't remember the fix.
Then, as I relaxed in the reading room one day it came to me. Shazam! It
was the double relay! 

Verily, verily, I say unto you, if your bus dieth after 8 seconds, but
idleth when you unplugeth the AFethM, the double relay has forsaken you and
you must toss it to the dungheap.

Once that problem was solved, I tried running the bus up to 2000 rpm, but I
was getting some bad vibes--as in slight backfiring--so I tried figuring
that out. My quest led me to replace the coil and *that's* where I screwed
up. No doubt the coil was bad, but when I went to Autoz*ne and purchased a
coil, they had two listed for '77 FI buses (my FI system is from '77, so
that's what I told them). I chose the one without the internal resistor,
thinking that was the right choice...I don't know *why* I thought that, but
I was SORELY mistaken.

Commandment #11: Thou shalt not buy parts from rookies, lest ye suffer the
perils thereof.

So, I entered the viscous cycle that led to fryination of points and the
oversignaling to the brain. So I was getting more popping (backfiring) and
bad running until eventually (within about 3 minutes run time, actually),
the bus wouldn't start at all.

[This is your brain; this is your brain on an external resistor coil. Any
questions?]

At this point, I've put about 7 or 8 minutes on the clock without actually
being able to bring the engine up to 2000 rpm for any sustained break-in
period...and I'm not liking that.

So I turn to the experts. They diagnose my problem, do some other, related
work for me, and charge me 3 hours _at_ $60/hr + the governor's portion +
parts. I figure I could have paid myself $2/hr and it would have cost me
about $360 to solve this problem...and maybe my marriage. I got out waaaaay
on the good side.

Verily, verily, I preacheth. Whenevereth you runneth out of ideas and hath
followed the Bentley and the Bosch and the Wilson and reapeth not what ye
have sowed, come off your cheap *ss and pony up a few dollars to the
professionals. After all, they gotta eat too and if you don't pay 'em once
in a while, they won't be around next time you needeth them.

Anyway, I thought some of you would like to know that my '72 Riviera is on
the road again. And don't worry, I'm not going to try to compete with Bob
Hoover. His sermons were much nicer and he's a waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better
mechanic than I am!
