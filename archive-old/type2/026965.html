Subject: RIVIERA FOR SALE

I am needing to sell my '78 Riviera.  This is a beautiful bus, I purchased 
it from a man that had purchased it from the original just a few months 
earlier.  The van is in great shape.  Has all seats, IT IS NOT A CAMPER, it 
is a passenger bus with a pop top.  I just put a new head on it and have all 
receipts for it.  I also at the same time as the head had the FI worked on.  
The bus runs great and with very little work could be close to perfect.  I 
am asking $2200.OBO Please e-mail me if you would like some pictures. And 
please do not be afraid to make offers I am really needing to sell, wish I 
did not have to but I do.
Thanks,
PS: The bus is in Portland OR.
