Subject: Trouble with 2nd gear
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

My 1982 Vanagon Westfalia has been acting up when in
2nd gear.  Specifically, when I am driving in 2nd and
am giving it gas all is well but if I let up off the
accelerator and then depress it I am not in gear
anymore and I can hear the transmission gears rattle. 
All other gears are fine, only 2nd gear has this
problem.  Is this what it means to pop out of gear?
And    does this mean a transmission rebuild?
