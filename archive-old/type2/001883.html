Subject: Windshield Confusion

Hey Folks,
     A few days ago I posted my sad tale of breaking my old windshield while
trying to reinstall it into the '77 Westy. I called Safelite, and was quoted
around $200.00(just for the glass), which I thought was a bit too much.
Several nice folks emailed me with suggestions, and I went to
windshieldstogo_dot_com, and was quoted a price of $80.00, actually far cheaper
than I expected. I called them and they confirmed the glass was in stock at
the warehouse closest to me (Fleet Dr. in Alexandria, VA.) So, today I go to
get it, and I'm driving through this industrial park looking for the place,
6616 Fleet Dr., and there it is...a Safelite dealer! Within minutes I had my
new windshield. The guy at the desk told me he hadn't seen a VW bus
windshield go out of there in 3 years. I'll report back on how the next
installation goes.
