Scott,

I believe that this is the business you're thinking of? 

http://www.vw-online.co_dot_uk/baysplits/ 

They're in the UK, and sell fibreglass nose (and other) panels to convert the 
appearance.

They have a small gallery of pictures on their site. Personally, I don't like 
them, but others may think they're wonderful, takes all kinds. (I shudder to 
think what the reactions to my planned mods to a basket case DC will be).

Hope this is what you wanted.

Neale

&gt; I hear that a European company offers a split window kit for the bay window
&gt; bus...has anybody heard of this or actually done the conversion?
