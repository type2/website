Subject: Re: [T2] Upcoming trip

OK, where you are from was a stupid question, sorry I didn't read slower.

I wouldn't take I-70 through MO unless you really need to, it is a very
narrow four lane that has the traffic of a 6 lane day and night.  There are
some beautiful small 2 lane highways south of I70 that will take you through
some beautiful Ozark country.

Not much through KS unless you are into ultralights, RANS aircraft is in
Hays KS and is just 10 minutes off I70.

You could head north and pick up I80 which will take you through the Neb.
badlands, or head even further north into South Dakota and hit the Black
hills, they have a bunch to see.

&gt; Where do you live?

&gt;&gt; Hello,
&gt;&gt; I'm new to this mail list and to the Volkswagen phenom. I've just purchased a
&gt;&gt; '78 Westfalia and am picking it up next week. My wife and I fly to Denver
&gt;&gt; from
&gt;&gt; our home in Michigan and will meander our way back home slowly. My question
&gt;&gt; is; are there any interesting places to go or see on our way back? We have
&gt;&gt; four daze to make the trip and have considered Memphis, Santa Fe, and St.
&gt;&gt; Louis. Any help from people who've made this trip or lives somewhere in
&gt;&gt; between would be greatly appreciated. FYI, I've purchased a new copy of John
&gt;&gt; Muir's book and a good road atlas. Hopefully, I won't need the former. Oh
&gt;&gt; yeah, I love this list and you all seem like a great bunch of people.
&gt;&gt; Richard
&gt;&gt; new '78 Westy (no name yet)
