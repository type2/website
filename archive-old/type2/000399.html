Subject: Now what?!?  69 bus tire/ brake issues

I finally got the new tires on the 69 camper today 185R14 D rated.

They say  65 pounds maximum pressure, and that is what they put in them, but
what pressures should I run?

The tire place had a hell of a time getting them balanced due to an
adjustable adapter that was not working right, so I am not sure they are
balanced correctly. Anyway, as I drove off there was no roughness in the
ride. They seemed very smooth until I touched the brakes. When I touch the
brakes, the petal does that vibrating up and down thing like I have a warped
drum. What the?
Why would this start right after the new tires were put on? It does not make
any sense to me.

I'm ready to set the thing on fire, and be done with it. Please help.
