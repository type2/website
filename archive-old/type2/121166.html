Subject: jacking up the bus

Can I jack up the rear end of my bus from the engine carrier?  I just 
wanted to check before actually doing it.  It would be alot faster than 
doing either side.

While I'm on the subject, are there other good jack points (other than 
the normal ones) to put a floor jack under that won't damage the 
undercarriage?  I wouldn't mind also being able to jack up the entire 
front end when I need to do work on the front.

thanks,
mike
