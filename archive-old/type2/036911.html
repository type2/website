&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone know of any decent heaters that plug into the cigarette lighter?
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm about to embark across Canada with no heat...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; go to good ski shop, buy skibib, down coat, warm gloves, heated socks.

You can also go to a motorcycle shop and get electrically heated chaps 
jackets, and gloves.

Defrosting the windows?  No idea!  I generally reserve my sojurns up north
for the times when the geese are there.  Geese are no dummies!
