Ok, y'all.  I see RMMW has this electric blanket for sale, plug it into the
cig lighter and it heats up for the lucky user.  Anyone order this?  My
girlfriend freezes in my '72, I'm used to VeeDubs so the cold doesn't affect
me.  Was going to order this blanket for her, but wanted to know if it was
any good.
