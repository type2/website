Subject: T/L and mirror specials + more

   Again I am passing a savings on to the list. One of my suppliers had an
overstock on 1962-1971 tail light assemblies. These are the complete
assemblies, housing, lens, seal, and bezel. These are made overseas and have
the pigtail wire out the back. Now the deal $35.00 a PAIR, buy a pair for
spares or just for parts. This is a very limited time special and I'm sure
will sell out soon.
   Also for you split bus owners, how about a PAIR of repo elephant ear
mirrors with arms, $25.00 dollars a PAIR, again this is limited and I'm just
passing my savings to all of you on the list ONLY.

   Repo WESTY racks are arriving today, $275.00 one heck of a deal and I am
getting more of the heater conversion tubes in Friday. These are the tubes
that go from the heater boxes to the chassis tubes, eliminating the metal
dampener. Available in 50mm to 60 mm and I just had them made in 60 mm to 60
mm also for you 65 -67 split bus owners. These are for buses running the
later heater boxes.

   Watch for more good deals in the future.
