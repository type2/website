Subject: [T2] Reply re '71 1600 engine into '72 1700 Type 2

Replying to Andy Martin's question re transplanting a European specification 
'71 Type 2 1600 engine into his '72 Type 2, I assume that his '72 van 
originally has a 1700 Type 4 style engine.

If this is so, then he will need to use the 200mm pressure plate and driven 
plate from the '71 van, rather than the 210mm hardware from the 1700 engine.

To fit the 1600 engine in the '72 van, he will also need the engine rear 
support beam and detachable chassis brackets as used on the European 1972-79 
VW 1600 Type 2, which I have available for sale if desired.

The engine tinware (i.e. coverplates) to seal around the engine bay, for the 
1971 VW 1600 Type 2 and 1972 VW 1600 Type 2, are very different! I have at 
least some of those needed for a '72, for sale at the moment.

If Andy does fit the 1600 engine in the '71 van, he would be well advised to 
use the standard air filter with thermostatically controlled inlet air, to 
combat carburettor icing and quicker warm-up.
