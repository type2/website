Subject: Ignition problems

I was driving home from work today and my engine cut out suddenly.._dot_completely
dead.  I found out pretty quickly that the coil was not getting power.  I
shorted it to the battery to get off a busy road.  I'm not sure if it's the
ignition switch, the wire from it or something else entirely.  Any other
possibilities?  I am considering rigging something up to bypass the switch,
it's a bear to replace and it would be the second time.  Any ideas?

Thanks for the help.
