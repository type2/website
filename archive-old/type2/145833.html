Subject: Re: [T2] OT?: priming a radiator

In a message dated 10/18/05 11:51:04 AM, CTONLINE_at_webtv_dot_net writes:


&gt; For a household radiator, do yourself a favor, and have it powdercoated.
&gt; As long as it's freshly sandblasted this would be the best in the long
&gt; run.
&gt; 
&gt; It'll last a lifetime without falling off.
&gt; 
   How would powdercoating affect the
efficiency of the heat transfer...?-(
