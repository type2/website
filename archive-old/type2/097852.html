  poptop.

Ok---I retract the Home Depot Formula 50--I wasn't aware that they tried
to protect the untrained populace with a weak formula.
Forget the watered down Poo-Poo----

Deal direct with Zep as I do and get the eye watering, breath grabbing,
good stuff that cleans like crazy---

Like Squeaky clean.----

The Zep stuff you get direct from your local Zep commercial account
distributor is totally different than the Zep products sold at
do-it-yourself stores. The store stuff is already watered down
ready-to-use. The real stuff is a concentrate. i.e. one gallon of
product X makes 55 gallons. One gallon of the store bought stuff makes 1
gallon:) 
Using Formula 50 as an example, it is sold in a 32 oz spray bottle
called Formula 50 R.T.U. [which means ready to use] It SUCKS as a
cleaner in this form. About as strong as water. I believe it to be 98%
water......
