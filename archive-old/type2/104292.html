Subject: hall sender vs points

I've never had a van before that had a hall sender, but now I do...my
'80 Westy (now tentatively named &quot;CreamPuff.&quot;)
  Anyway, I'm wondering what the standard protocol for fall back is with
these.  Do I carry a spare distributor, all set up to go?  Or what?
I've been in the habit of keeping a few spare sets of points around.
What goes bad on the Hall Unit?
