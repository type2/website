Subject: RE: [VB] classic/octo caravan?`

We will be leaving Havasu at 6 am Friday. I don't know how many in the
busavan yet but it seems somewhere close to 10, crusing speed 65 mph.
Rustybus is leaving Friday am, as is Everett (I think), earl, kyle and joe,
and a whole bunch of Phoenix people are going.
