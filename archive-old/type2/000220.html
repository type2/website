&gt; Is it worth the extra money for the better gas.  Of course its probably
all the same
&gt; gas anyway, with just a different sign, ha HA.

In Holland all gas stations now carry only two types of unleaded gas.

Standard is 95 RON octane which is used by the majority of people (I do
too). Super is 98 RON, it is said that only high performance engines (BMW,
ALFA etc) really need this. These are the octane numbers you will find in
the VW docs. The US uses a different scale (numbers are lower). I do not
know the precise conversion to US (ROZ?) octane numbers. It is probably
somewhere in the archives. There used to be a 92 RON which was taken off the
market a while ago because oil companies wanted to limit the number of
variations for logistics reasons (and so we are forced to buy the more
expensive 95!). Leaded gas has been taken off the market in Holland and
Germany  with other countries to follow. In stead you can buy gas with a
lead replacement additive. Whether or not that works as well as lead is
still somewhat of an open question. I expect the demand for that type of gas
will diminish and it too will be NLA in the near future. So, if your engine
cannot run on unleaded be prepared. I understood that heads on European
uprights were different (not suited to unleaded) from the US ones but that
pancakes were the same. I had my '77 1600 DP retrofitted with new heads with
hardened valve seats (old ones were bust anyway). The German  PO of my '78 2
litre however told me he had always used leaded gas so I'm not sure what
this baby needs.

So to come back to your original question: is it worth the extra money to
buy a higher octane gas? I don't know. I think you should search the
archives on this one too and make up your own mind. Then try it and collect
evidence. And when you have proof that it either is or is not let us know.
