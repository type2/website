Thanks John, as per usual you are right! I had some outdoor equipment
shipped up here via UPS and they hit me with a 30 dollar brokerage fee!!!!
Needless to say if it doesn't get shipped USPS I don't buy it. A lesson here
for Canadians, and I'm glad to see that you know this, many companies in the
US don't and then give us Canucks a hard time for asking for USPS.

&gt; we regularly ship to Canada. We also ship USPS, which doesn't always
collect
&gt; duty, UPS ALWAYS collects it.
