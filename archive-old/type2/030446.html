When moms vanagon died the first time, (dark, rainy, cold. they went to
pick up pizza, and couldnt leave! heh..) this is EXACTLY what it took to
get it started.  I started fiddling and looking, nothing appeared wrong.

It would start for a spit, then die.  Then it wouldnt do anything at all.
SO I wondered if the injectors were getting signal.  pulled one lead,
hooked hte light up..had mom crank a second...and vroom! the damn thing
started, and didnt give us any more trouble for 3 or so months.

Then it did it again.

This time around, it was off the road for like 2 months (!!) before we got
it fixed.  Same thing, though.  Run for a second, die, and not do anything
else till you let it sit.

Eventually turned out to be a bad contact on one of the relays in the
double relay.  One contact set had ~1 million ohms across it when closed.
Filed it, it only brought it down a bit.  For a temp solution, I just
rigged another relay to take place of that side (its easy, if you really
look....;).  Ran like that for...hell, near another 3+ months before I put
the new one in (had it, just didnt get a chance to put it in..)

Still worked. Heh.;) Frankenrelay...

anyhow, I'd start checking out that double relay if it happens again.

good luck....david
