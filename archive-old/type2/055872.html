Our fledgling VW club attended a show in nearby Valdosta, GA today 
and walked away with five awards.  100% of our members in attendance 
were award winners, and in one case our club swept over 2/3 of a 
category.

Now for the facts:

This morning Steve Curvey, his nephew Michael, and I drove our two 
VWs to &quot;Bugs at the Zoo&quot; in Valdosta, about 75 miles away; Steve and 
Michael in Steve's 73 Super Beetle and meself in the 60 Ghia 'vert.  
Apparently we just missed Tom Taylor and his orange (for sale) '73 
Ghia on the way out of town, so our thundering caravan was just two.

The ride over was pleasant and uneventful, through the rolling red 
clay hills of North Fla. quail country and then the wiregrass section 
of SW Georgia.  The weather threatened (my Ghia has but a vestigial 
top) and remained blustery all day - yet turned off into a 
nice blue afternoon sky with temps around the low 80s.

We loafed along and arrived at the show just after 9:30.  Steve and I 
both decided to enter our cars just for the hell of it.  
Unfortunately for me, a woman from Jacksonville with a pristine '69 
coupe was there, as well as Tom's coupe.  How could I compete with 
cars that had complete paint jobs and carpet and junk?  Maybe they 
would hand out a prize for Oldest Running Ghia?

Meanwhile Steve's category wasn't shaming him too quickly, so there 
was hope.  This was the second year for Bugs at the Zoo, coordinated 
by the Southeast VW Club and their tireless and delightful core 
personality, Kathy Jacobs.  I'd say there were over 30-40 show cars: 
three Ghias, a late 50's (custom but very nice) double cab Type II 
and a couple of mid-70s westies (one owned by a TV2 member), along 
with a nice triplet of Things, a cool lo-mile unrestored Notch, and a 
trike.

The swap meet had a few goodies, including one guy with some 
split-windshield Type2 shop manuals -- what looked like the source 
for Bentley, very nice, with color wiring diagrams and in grey-blue 
binders.  Overall I thought the swap selection was a little less 
robust than it could have been, but I'm sliding more and more 
into esoterica, so '65 bug taillight lenses don't send me 
the way they used to.  Steve scored a nice chrome front logo to go on 
his soon-to-be 69 loaf for a very good price.

There were also a couple of neukafers on hand, which were being 
loaned out for rides around the show lot (Steve's 15-year-old nephew 
Michael drove one :-).  I found them interesting and almost queued up 
for a test drive a couple of times.  Chris Price (the bud vase guy) 
said he's had his up to 120mph already [professional driver on closed 
course test track only! do not try this at home! 8-]

Kathy was having trouble lining up enough judges so Steve and I 
pitched in, which was a lot of fun for both of as we'd never judged 
at a show before (needless to say, this isn't councours d'elegance).  
I've looked at enough potential purchases and show cars (and graded 
enough Extemporaneous Speeches) to know what kind of stuff to look 
for, and of course, we rated every other car real low so ours would 
win.  Right?

After the final tallies were in, we had:

Type II (all) second place:  Jean-Claude of TV2, with his westy.
Super Beetle (all stock) first place!: Steve Curvey's 73.
Ghia (all stock) second place: Tom Taylor's 73
third place: me! (never mind that there were only three Ghias)
best club participation (organizers didn't count): Tallahassee 
Vintage VWs!

The trophies are really cute -- little wood shelves with Beetle 
models and wild animals (get it? Bugs at the Zoo?).  The club trophy 
is a real treat -- made from the VW micromachine set and a little 
micromachine drivein.  We fought over it so badly that the club has 
now disbanded in acrimony and -- what?!  No!  But we do wish we had a 
clubhouse so we could put it over the mantel.  We're thinking of 
offering it as the &quot;TV2 Cup&quot;, winnable in open competition, but we'd 
probably lose it immediately....  I'll take some photos of the 
trophys and post 'em.

We posed for a triumphal group photo while the show closed down, then 
headed home.  Again, an uneventful but blustery ride.

Hats off to Southeast VWs for a good show, and it was larger than 
last year's, I think -- so it should continue to grow.  Wild 
Adventures is a cool venue for folks with families.
