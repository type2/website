Subject: Re: [T2] Hydraulic clutch

That is a good point.  The first time I replaced a broken clutch cable it
was dark and I was again underway in 30 minutes.  Importantly also, the cost
of the cable is only $5.


&gt; I don't really notice any difference in clutch feel between the two
&gt; systems.  So far, the hydraulic system has required fewer repairs, but I
&gt; fear the hydraulic because I cannot repair/replace it alone.  I know that
&gt; the cable clutches are subject to breakage, and have been thru my share of
&gt; roadside clutch cable replacements, but my point is that you *can* replace
&gt; the cable in less than a half hour, by yourself.  Even if you have the
&gt; right replacement part for the hydraulic system, you need two people to
&gt; bleed it.  I hate to bet on that, especially since I am usually alone when
&gt; I am on the road.
