Subject: body work (rear quarter)?

Hello again folks --

As I get to all the little &quot;need attention&quot; things on
my 71 Westier hardtop, I am trying to determine the
easiest method of repair for my torn right rear
quarter panel.  It appears as though a previous owner
backed up over something and RIPPED The sheet metal
right off from the top of the wheel well back.  Of
course, rust has set in at the edge of the rip, and
the battery tray inside is missing (leaving the engine
bay open to water and whatever debris the right rear
tire decides to throw back and up).  (The battery was
relocated to the left side successfully).  

Anyway, I am hoping I can find a donor bus in a junk
yar and cut the metal off it and have a body shop wled
it in place on my bus.  Has anyone ever had sucha
thing done, and might they share with me their
expectations on cost?  I am away from home at school
now (i.e. away from all my tools and modest, VERY
novice welding equipment), so doing ti myself is not
an option.  

The tear extends straight back from the top of the
wheel well, right around to under the tailight lens (t
the point where the lens is JUST loose from the lower
mounting screw being loose in it's slightly-rusted
mounting hole).  I suspect all the rust would need to
be cut off and the panel cut and welded accordingly. 
It's the interior welding (to create the baterry tray)
that I think would be most costly.

Any help would be greatly appreaciated!  

Many thanks in advance,

Chris
