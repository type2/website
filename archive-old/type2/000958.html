Subject: Re: Fuel Injection Fuel Tank 

&gt; Hello folks,
&gt;    Recently Todd said
&gt; &quot;I plan to install a complete 1978 L-Jetronic fuel injection system into
my
&gt; 74 loaf......Would it be possible to add a T-fitting to the standard fuel
&gt; port on the bottom of the tank?&quot;
&gt;
&gt; I know someone who has done exactly that, and it works fine.  First
install
&gt; a short section of fuel hose to the tank outlet fitting and then put the
tee
&gt; into that hose.  Then, one side of the tee feeds the fuel pump and the
other
&gt; side accepts the return fuel.  My friend has been running a setup like
that
&gt; for about a year now with no apparent problems.  And of course, don't
forget
&gt; to put a clamp on the end of every hose.

This was not a good solution for me when I installed FI in my '72 Westy.  It
created a vapor lock nightmare when the car idled for 5 minutes or so.

The  fuel would get hotter and hotter while it recirculated through the &quot;T&quot;
connection, vaporized and the van would die and not start until it cooled
down.  In a normal FI set up the return line goes back in to the tank and
cools off. It took week and some good direction from the list to detect the
problem.

I resolved this by putting in another fuel line connection on the top of my
tank just behind the sender.  Not pretty but it is safe and it works.
