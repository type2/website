Subject: Karma and Charlie Ford and 10 year anniversary

You youngsters may not remember the Charlie Ford saga of ten years ago.
Charlie wanted to do something before he left the magic age of 40 in January
1997, ten years ago or so.  The story starts in about August 1995 and
includes a full one year odyssey of the USA.

His story and experiences show that VW Karma, and what VW Karma does.  There
is, somewhere, a better replication of Charlie's postings.  Perhaps the
files were lost during the most recent server outage.

On this ten year anniversary, perhaps someone could point us in the right
direction.  And let us old timers remember and send Charlie Ford our best
wishes and thanks for some interesting stories (I went to that trailer park
in Nags Head North Carolina and stayed a few nites during a Christmas
season, just to share a few moments of what it would have been like to
travel the USA alone.)

To read these stories below, I suggest that you do a 'select all'  'copy'
and 'paste' into a word processor of sorts.
