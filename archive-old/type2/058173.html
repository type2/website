&gt; If your camper interior is upholstered in a lovely shade of avocado

No, actually, a sort of beige which is somewhat familiar to me
as the color of the upholstery in the '71 bug that Dad bought
brand-new way back when.  Another story for another time. 

&gt; you could be the proud owner of a Sportsmobile!  Other typical
&gt; Sporty camper features are a white and yellow linoleum floor, 

Check...

&gt; yellow and
&gt; white checked cutains, 

Just plain yellow, installed within the last year by the PO...

&gt; closet on passenger side, 

Check...

&gt; square box behind
&gt; driver's seat that holds a porta-potti, 

Not exactly; it's a jump-seat with storage behind the seat
back and under the seat cushion... 

&gt; icebox/sink combo behind
&gt; passenger seat.  

Used to be, defective unit removed and not replaced by
PO... 

&gt; Lots of cheap woodgrain 

Check...

But this is going to be replaced by real wood panelling, 
manufactured by my good self, with Dad's help, in his 
woodshop.  

&gt; and peeling white ceiling vinyl.  

The ceiling is actually in remarkably good shape.

&gt; Very Seventies
&gt; and quite delightful.  

Well, yeah.  It's a project, re-doing the interior.  We're 
actually looking forward to it. 

&gt; Folding table slides in slot on drivers side
&gt; wall. 

No, just a table that folds down flush with the wall. 

Anyway, thanks to several URL's sent by helpful folks 'round
here, we've determined that it's a Riviera.  Based on the 
brochures we've seen on-line, the interior looks somewhat 
more like a Sportmobile than a Riviera, but camper interiors
are so varied and customized and subject to change that I 
didn't think it was a reliable way to determine.  Two things
make me think it's a Riviera rather than a Sportmobile: 

1:  as someone pointed out, all the on-line images I've seen
show the Sportmobile having a single &quot;x&quot;-shaped pair of 
brackets on each side, holding the pop-top steady, whereas
the Riviera, in all the pictures I've seen, have two &quot;x'es.&quot;  

2:  All the Riviera pictures I've seen show them with a roof
rack for luggage over the front of the vehicle.  Sportmobile
pictures do not show the rack. 

Ours has the two sets of brackets, and the luggage rack.  
We're pretty sure it's a Riviera.
