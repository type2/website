Subject: There's an EGR filter in SD junkyard
Message-Id: &lt;199907131402.HAA18495_at_helix.ucsd_dot_edu&gt;

At the Ecology yard off of Mission Blvd. in Oceanside. On one of three 
buses in the yard at noon yesterday. EGR filter appears to be in as-new 
condition. After a year of looking I finally broke down and ordered new 
&gt;from Ron. It's on a '76. Hope someone snags it.

(Another bus has seatbelt hooks in perfect condition. I also ordered 
these from Ron after endless searching).
