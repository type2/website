Subject: Removing TDC sensor

I'm in the process of dismantling my engine and I'm wondering how to remove
the TDC sensor.  This is the black plastic thing with the wire coming out of
it that pokes through the RH case half towards the flywheel (type 4 engine).
I assume it comes out in the direction of the flywheel but it's hard to
tell.  Does it twist first or just pop straight out?

I'm debating whether to put this thing back when I'm finished, leave it off
and plug the hole, or just cut the wire.  It's not used for anything any
more.  Any advice?
