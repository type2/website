Subject: Bus status/Body shop (long)

list,
well here it is I bought a 79 2.0l and figured I would put in a new
rebuild. I ordered it from bus depot and it came from avp. Got it in
with the help of a local mechanic. It never really ran correctly and I
spoke with avp they said I probobly put in the dist drive nut backwaqrds
and this was a common problem. My mechanic who I think really didn't
know said that wasn't it..anyway I have been working (my job gets real
demanding) and haven't had the time to mess with it. So today I had the
tow truck come and take the bus to a local VW shop and hope fully they
can figure out what the heck is going on before I spend another summer
without a bus. So here is the question.. assuming I can get the bus back
and in running order. does anyone know of a shop in the southern NY area
that will do rust removal/body repair/paint?? Can I bring it to any body
shop or should I use one that specializes in VW?? Thanks in advance
