Subject: Re: [T2] Stock FI to progressive carb, any thoughts or
  comments?

Hi Gregory,

Fix the stock FI, its a better system for a lot of reasons... The 
relationship between HP, powerband, fuel economy and emissions is 
maximized with a properly maintained FI system... you just can't get 
all of those attributes as optimized with carbs, and esp. not with a 
single carb.

My $.02 ??

Start with basic troubleshooting procedures!
There's a Bosch Pro Training manual online at www.ratwell_dot_com that 
contains an excellent diagnostic procedure for troubleshooting FI 
issues.  It always starts with verifying the valve adjustment, dwell 
and timing, vacuum, injector spray pattern and fuel pressure. If any of 
those are out of spec it will affect idle, and if you start replacing 
FI components before verifying these other factors you are wasting both 
time and $$$.  From there you can investigate the FI components as 
required, following the factory procedures to resolve the problem as 
quickly and cheaply as possible.

The trick is to work with real information rather than assumptions. 
Don't just assume the valves are good, check them anyway. Same with 
dwell and timing. Vaccuum affects timing and fuel pressure, and has a 
huge impact on idle. Investments in gauges may cost a bit up front, but 
will save a ton of money in the long run when compared to the cost of 
replacing components that weren't defective.

Happy trails,

&gt; My bus is non-operational right now because I cannot
