Subject: Re: [T2] electric fuel pump.

Bob, you are quoting what Terry wrote as though I said it!!!  I did NOT
say/write that. You cut off my reply to Terry.
Here is what I wrote AFTER Terry's section:
&quot;On any fuel injected vehicle, the main electric fuel pump is ALWAYS below the
tank and is gravity feed. The pump is a pusher, not a puller.

Slide under any VW bus or Mercedes and look where the pump is mounted.&quot;

&gt; &gt;If there isn't a transfer pump involved to get the fuel to the secondary
&gt; &gt;pump, as in the case of the Vanagon, or a Bus the pump does both--it
&gt; &gt;pulls as well as pushes.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Where did you come up with this stuff?
&gt; ============================&gt;
&gt; A good reference book is latest edition of &quot;Hydraulic Institute Standards&quot;
&gt; It covers rotary, diaphragm, and centrifugal pump design parameters as well
&gt; as operating physics.

&gt;
&gt; The idea that pumps do not &quot;suck&quot; can best be shown by the following:
&gt; Take a glass of water.
&gt; Put a tight lid on it.
&gt; Pierce the lid with a straw and seal the entrance.
&gt; Now then, try to &quot;suck&quot; the water out.
&gt; Can't do it.
&gt;
&gt; Now then.........
&gt; Pierce the lid so as to allow atmospheric pressure to be imposed up on the
&gt; water.
&gt; Now you can &quot;suck&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; Actually, what you are doing is dropping the pressure in the straw,
&gt; and allowing atmospheric pressure to force replacement water into the straw.
&gt;
&gt; That is what a pump does.
&gt; The impeller or pumping member drops the inlet pressure to impeller.
&gt; The driven vanes of the impeller blade or gear pump lobes impart energy to
&gt; the replacement fluid, and the fluid is then expelled out with added energy
&gt; from the rotating impeller.
