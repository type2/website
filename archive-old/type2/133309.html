&gt; 78 Champagne Edition...stock FI engine.

78 HPbus with Auto tranny and lots of junque in the back
mostly stock with a pertronix and hyd lifters.

&gt; Time for those folks with 230,000 on their odometers to look back in their
&gt; mileage books and see what they got!

322k on the odo,  I generally consider 15-16 ok in city stop and go
driving (which is a lot of my driving)
  have gotten 19.5 with a goooooood tailwind on the road.  think I got
over 20MPG once but I suspect a math error.   and I tend to drive the
speed limit or lower (60-65mph) on the interstate.
