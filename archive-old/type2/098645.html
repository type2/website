Subject: More starter problems

OK, so i bit the bullet and bought a new starter, put
it in and the exact same thing happens, turn the key,
one clunk of the solenoid and then nothing! I
rechecked every wire going to the starter, all have
checked out at 12V and now I am super confused about
what could be wrong.  I have tried shorting the
starter and it does the same thing, clunk and no
crank.  what gives?  thanks for you help
