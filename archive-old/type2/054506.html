Subject: lost for a name

To all the volks out there!
I have a serious problem with my bus.  I have a feeling that it is going
to take a great deal of time and effort to fix this problem and I don't
know if I can do it alone.  I am asking for your trusted advice and
support to help me out with my plight because I don't know if I will be
able to tackle this enormous problem on my own...


	my bus doesn't have a name :(


I see all you bus owners with a name for your bus and it makes me (and
my bus) feel very sad and lonely.  I see &quot;Lily&quot; and &quot;Casper&quot; and &quot;Bluto&quot;
and mine's just &quot;...an orage 76 westy...&quot;  I had a green one before and
I didn't have a name for that one either, well.. other than the few
friends that dubbed it &quot;the booger box.&quot;

So, my friends, I ask for your help and direction so that one day I will
be able to give my bus the best name possible!

Thank you!
Mike

&quot;...an orange 76 westy...&quot;

p.s. Yeah, yeah, I KNOW it's an hour and a half before Friday, but I
just couldn't wait any longer! :p
