Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Cooling flaps

In my 248,000mi never rebuilt engine, there was a period from when I 
bought it (65K)  of about 80K mi where the thermostat was not working 
and cable missing- Yes it took longer to warm up (driving it fixed that) 
but I can't say it enhanced wear. I put it all back when engine was 
pulled at 150K mi to change clutch disk.   Idle warmup did improve 
dramatically. It's now being rebuilt (ran fine, but had low oil pressure 
and ran hot, which on teardown was worn cam bearings and dirty cylinders).

   Getting ready to pull the engine out of my 72.

    It has no cooling flaps or thermostat.

    Is this something I should try to find and get put back in?
