Subject: Kool Patch

This is an a '72 Westy.

I kept on getting moisture on the floor around the ice box-- It is not the
water tank and I did not have ice in there.  It is either the trap in the
drain pipe or perhaps water splashing in from beneath.  Regardless of where
it the water haas been coming from, the wood floor in that area has rotted
away.   I am in the process of gutting the camper and fixing the floor.
Startling how many rust spots there are and even a few holes.

So I am going to por-15 the rust and repair the holes.  There has not been
much discussion about Kool Patch for three or four years.  Are people still
feeling it is a good solution for Floor sealing and sound deadening or did
everyone who used it have their van rust away and are no longer on the list?


Any new advice on using Kool Patch? Or other suggestions some one might want
to do now that the camper is gutted?

Thanks
