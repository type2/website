&gt; Hi Laura, 
&gt; 
&gt; Not sure what to say about the noises, and I blew an engine to pieces  
&gt; last weekend. 

LOL,, ah ,, that is an understatement! 


&gt;But there is an engine noise page online at  
&gt; www.ratwell_dot_com, and it links to this sound of a loose connecting rod:

&gt; 
&gt; (Jamie, is that the sound you heard my engine make??)

Yuppers! 


&gt; Dave (Busahaulic) makes some good points but I'd suggest you do a bit  
&gt; of homework before you drop the engine. 
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Check the oil. The 1979 engine has hydraulic lifters and 20W50 oil  
&gt; should be used. Low oil level can cause a lifter to leak down.
 

Greg,, you make some really thorough points!,, Lifters can really make a 
person worry the first time the hear them! 

Check lifters should come in the same process of adjust valves.. 

I can't think to say MAKE SURE THE LIFTERS are HARD ,, enough! 

but put overheat with noise.. ,, I still think anything short of a complete 
overhaul for that engine is doing an injustice. 

Laura may find a more economical method to get the bus running again.. 

If a valve seat has done piston damage,, the rod may be bent.. and the 
crank,,,  and one thing leads to another! 

Jamie
