Subject: Engine compartment integrity

Just got a post off-list that, combined with the post earlier about the 
missing plug on the flywheel cover, raises an interesting problem.

When a water-cooled vehicle's cooling system fails, the failure is 
obvious. Steam comes up, or an idiot light comes on. But our cooling 
system doesn't signal its failure (on un-gauged buses). And even when 
gauges tell us something's wrong, there is not an obvious cause.

There should be some way to test the integrity of the engine 
compartment. Some way to pressurize it (cover the vents) and test how 
fast it leaks.

But darned if I know how to do it!

Mark
