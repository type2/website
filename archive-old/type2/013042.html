Subject: Pop-top has been violated
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

Hello again,

Another question about my &quot;new&quot; '71 Westy (and yes
there will be more). Our Pop-top seems to have been
violated somewhere along the line and it looks like
somebody cut out the entire inside rim of the roof
opening.  Since I don't know enough about what it's
supposed to look like I have no idea of what it will
take to replace it. They also seem to have taken out
pretty much everything except for the fiberglass top
(which is now screwed down and caulked closed). 

Where can I find out what's missing and how do I go
about refabricating what has been so sadly removed?

Thanks again!

Tim
'71 Westy
