Our 74 hightop Contempo camper (one whose engine I've rebuilt...thanks to
Karl...but whose body got flipped on it's side) has the vent through the
floor, for the drain. Propane heater itself, used to cook/refrigerate/heat
the bus, is vented through side of bus, behind driver. Professional looking
job by Calif company. The heater itself is mounted under right side of
drivers seat, so don't know if this applies to your setup. Marv Krupp
