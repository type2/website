&gt; Lunch time reading:  Old magazine article says the 'new' 1971 VW bus, with
&gt; the front disk brakes, can go from 60 MPH to full stop in just 167 feet.
&gt; Rate of stop is 23 ft/sec, with a G rate about .72.
&gt;
&gt; Now, 167 ft /  23 ft/sec is just over 7 seconds.

No, it is just over 7 sec^-1, a totally meaningless measurement since
sec^-1 is a unit of frequency!  The problem is that the units on the
acceleration are wrong.  It should be 23ft/s^2 or 23ft/sec/sec.

60mph is 88ft/s.

88ft/s / 23ft/s^2 = 3.8s
