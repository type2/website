&gt;Rumor has it around hear in Maryland if you can get your hands on a 
&gt;support our troopers or troopers are our best protection bumper stickers 
&gt;the cops tend to leave you alone, i have yet to get one, i Think you have 
&gt;to donate to the Troopers Association, I'll ask at the county fair at the 
&gt;recoved paraphenia Trailer.

A friend once bought a OPP hat at a sportsmans show, because the cop told
him having it visisble in teh back window would help him avoid tickets;-)
Seremd to work, as he wasn't hassled much by the Man.

PS: looking for info on compatibility between 1976 and 1979 FI parts.
   Specifically, will Air Flow Sensor from 79 work on a 76?
  If not I'm looking for a 76 Air Flow Sensor and throttle body. Have 79
 to trade.
  What another parts might be different?
