&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;I have a 70 bus w/a rebuilt (by me) 1600cc single-port.  Recently, it has 
&gt;been difficult to start when its cold (sitting overnight - overnight temps 
&gt;appox 35F). 

Somewhat related but I wanted to pass it along to everyone.  My bus has started having trouble starting in the morning.  The temperates have been the same all week long but for some reason it takes longer to crank over.  I checked the dwell and it had gone from 50 to 52.  I should check on the battery while I'm in there next but I'm always surprised at the senstivity of the system...

Anyway I'm switching to electronic ignition the first chance I get now that the big trip is behind me.
