Subject: Re: [T2] Customer relations.

EXACTLY!


&gt;Customer relations.
&gt;
&gt;An air cooled VW repair shop is not a philanthropic enterprise. Men have 
&gt;families to feed. We must pay up or fix it ourselves.
&gt;
&gt;A $3000 repair estimate for a Bus that we can't turn around and sell for 
&gt;$1800 can be quite fair from the mechanic's point of view.  His job is to 
&gt;make it run safely at a fair price for parts and labor or walk away. He is 
&gt;a mechanic not a financial or life style advisor.
&gt;
&gt;On the other hand, any VW mechanic I trust with my Bus I can't afford.
