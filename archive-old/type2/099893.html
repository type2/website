&gt;You might also look at the wires and ground connection for the tank sender,
&gt;if you can still access it easily (actually, your mechanic should have
&gt;looked at these).  Those connections were pretty crappy when I checked mine
&gt;a couple weeks ago.  They are right there by the sender.  It's easy to
&gt;access on my bus because a PO had used a cold chisel to cut a home-made
&gt;&quot;access panel&quot; into the engine deck above the sender.  This has actually
&gt;come in handy, and is normally well sealed with duct tape.

Speaking of fuel senders, has anyone found it interesting that while the sender works it passes an electrical current while immersed in gasoline?  I assume this is an age old design that is inexpensive but why isn't this inherently dangerous?
