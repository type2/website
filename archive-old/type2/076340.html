&gt; &gt;I will accept the flack on this...... You don't need no stinking second
&gt; &gt;solenoid. Its a patch not a fix.
&gt; &gt;------------------------------
&gt; Just as the relay kits are a panacea for old wires.
&gt; Wires/terms/switches/solinoids/armatures/brushes/bearings get resistant
&gt; with age, just like us. &quot;click-click&quot; for start is many times a synergy of
&gt; weaknesses throughout the circuit.  The closer you are to stock, the better

and then there is the one that drives you nuts!?  my starter has been
driving me to drink for couple years now. when it works it works great,
when it doesn't, it doesn't

I have tried all of the accepted (and quite a few not so
accepted) methods to correct it.  There is no pattern and I am a fanatic
about trying to find patterns to solve intermitent problems. 
 replaced wiring, good 10 gauge stuff
 new ground cable
 replaced all the connectors with new, checked out.
 soldered em on
 new twin 1,000 amphour batteries.
 changed the selector lock out switch (automatic)
 
none of this has changed a dang thing, I have three starters operation is
identical with all three.  recently had the best Bosch essentially
blueprinted back to original spec.  nadda!

about the only thing that keeps me from being stranded is the &quot;mechanic's
bump switch&quot; I mounted in the engine compartment some years ago for tune
ups etc.  it is hard wired to the soenoid so it so far has always worked,
but it means getting out and going around to engine compartment to
operate

it appears to be a voltage drop because when it doesn't start or crank you
can hear the starter sort of hum a little.

I have bought one of the relay kits from Bus Depot but haven't installed
it.  but I am running out of things to look for?????


&gt; your &quot;luck&quot; (pocket book) is in the future. Patching is for getting back
&gt; home so you can remove the offense with proper follow up repair. Most/all
&gt; the time/money spent on patching is no longer available to fix it right. So
&gt; patching is for emergencies only, like when brokedown in Gooberburg. 

I do have to agree and I have over the 30+ years of owning old VW's done
some &quot;interesting&quot; patches to get home.

the last couple automatics, which don't push start!

&gt; dependably, and have spent only $20/20 minutes. Then pop in a new/reman
&gt; BOSCH starter when I get home, and take off the jurusrigusmortus and
&gt; salvage the hardware for future value in some way so the jerryricketsmongus
&gt; is not a total loss. Like maybe then actually replacing the old switch
&gt; wires properly shielded and routed to remove another weakness to insure
&gt; longer life for the new starter.

throw old part into back of van just in case of part &quot;infant
mortality&quot; seems a lot of that going around lately.  after a couple weeks
or so of working correctly, then the part gets garaged
