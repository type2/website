Subject: [T2] south african buses...

i've been seeing this video on worldlink tv by this s. african rasta that 
has a cool bus in it...it looks like it has a big evaporative cooler on the 
front, i guess to cool the passengers...the bus looks like a 68-70 with the 
wide five wheels....a spare tire stuck on the back hatch and a small pop 
top....just wondering if any one in s. af. knows how these coolers work...
