Subject: Re: [T2] accel cables

I guess that 74 Cal bus with Efi was also Automatic ,so there is 2 reasons the
cable lenght was changed?

Is there a listing somewhere of the accel cables years, and the part numbers
with the length?
I think the lenght should be a real help.
It seems to be a bit of an issue once the trans, or engine ,or  intake system
are changed in a particular year of bus..

I used a 78 trans cradle in my 74 bus, when I installed a 2.0 L engine with Efi
system, and the 78 trans, and the 78 cable loom and 78 accel cable. It worked in
the 74 body like it was in a 78 bus.

&gt; I think 74 Cal was the only place with fuel injectiion that year??
&gt;
&gt; basic differences in accel cables
&gt; .  single carb
&gt; .  double carb
&gt; .  fuel injection
&gt; .  auto tranny
