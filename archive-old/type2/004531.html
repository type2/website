Hello all...

First I would like to thank all who responded to my inquiry concerning the
value of a 76 Westy.  I was surprised at the number of responses.  I read
each one (usually twice) and have thought about little other than my soon to
made decision.  To all who responded, again, thank you.  You advice has
proved invaluable.

Anyway....I took a long drive and checked to the 76 Westy in question.  Boy,
my Westy looked pretty bad next to this one!   I actually verbalized that
feeling to a friend of mine in the presence of Gretchen (my Westy).  Feeling
terrible, I had to apologize to Gretchen.  After the test drive I was sure I
wanted to purchase the new Westy.  Having learned a few hard lessons in the
past I made arrangements to take her to my mechanic here in VA Beach.  If
that goes good, I am going to go through with the purchase.

The seller is selling for $$$ to restore a 75 Westy he has in his garage.
He was very nice and knew a hell of a lot more than I did about engines
(that's really not saying much).  But again, I am going to have her checked
out by a pro.  It will be money well spent.

I will keep you all up to date.  Take care of yourselves.....
