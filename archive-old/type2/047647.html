My mistake.  I thought all 80 up had o2 's.  Turns out its just 83 up.
You're problem still is a richness problem.  What are the HC and Nox (if
you have them) figures?  High HC usually means bad ignition problems.  I
would check the cold start, thermo time switch and Temp sensor #2 first.

The following are tests are a compilation of resistance tests from the four
or five manuals I found during my recent &quot;rich &quot;running problem.

1. Take the harness off the ECU

2. Look in the list library (EFI-Samick, I think) for a description of the
numbering on the pins.

3. put ohm meter contact between #13 and #17 ground.  This tests the
Temperature sensor II.  At 68 degrees it should be between 2000-2900 ohms.
(700-1000 _at_122 degrees; 200-400 _at_ 176 degrees; and less than 200 at
operating temp.)  Testing this at the plug test whether there is a problem
in the harness too.

4.  Test between #6 and # 27 to check the Air temp sensor in the AFM.  It
should be between 2100-2900 _at_ 68 degrees.

Note: if you find a problem,  check the readings at the device.  This will
tell whether its the harness or the devise.

5. Test the following AFM circuits:

            6 &amp; 7      40-300 ohms

            6 &amp; 8      130-260 ohms

            6 &amp; 9      200-400 ohms     (100-300 ohms)

            7 &amp; 8      100-500 ohms     (80-200 ohms)

            8 &amp; 9      70-140 ohms

The readings to the (side) are from bentley for 76 up models but I found
that the Bentley figures didn't jive with the other manuals and were to
restrictive.  (You'll be throwing away good part if you use Bentley)


Also check the cold start for leaks or the  thermo time switch for not
shutting off the cold start after warm up.
Have fun

&gt;Bill,

&gt;     You are correct.  I do not have a O2 sensor.  I am still stumped on
&gt;where to look for the problem.  Tomorrow I am going to test the whole FI
&gt;system.
