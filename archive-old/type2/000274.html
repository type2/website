I'm trying to restore the jalousie windows in my 71 Westy and clean them up.
Does anyone know where I can get the thin strip of rubber molding that goes
along the top window? It is about 3/8 in. wide and fits in a groove in the
top window molding.

Secondly, does anyone have any good tricks for cleaning aluminum and
removing slight pitting? Any help would be GREATLY appreciated. TIA TBear
