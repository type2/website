Subject: Driver's Side Noise

Hello All --
My girlfriend has a '77 bus with a noise up front on the driver's side.  It
sounds like a light, high pitched rubbing sound - not grinding.  It's
rhythm corresponds with the speed of the vehicle.  Sometimes it is effected
by braking (it stops or starts up) and sometimes the brakes have no effect
at all.  It was intermittent at first, but now it is progressively worse. 
The brakes themselves do not seem to be effected.   Is this a brake pad
rubbing?  A speedometer cable?  Something to worry about at all?  Or just
an annoyance?  Any ideas as to what it could be? 

Thanks.
