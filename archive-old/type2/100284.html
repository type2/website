Subject: Sliding Door/Handle

Iam looking for the outside door handle, for the sliding door on a 1984 
Vanagon.

Anyone on the lists have one they would like to sell?

Friend in our VW car Club is in need of one to complete his vehicle.

If you have this item you could p-mail him directly at...   
hallbeck_at_cnwl.igs_dot_net

or refer information through me.

Thanks.
