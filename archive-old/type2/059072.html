Subject: FS: 1971 Transporter, not too bad

I need to sell her because I can't really afford the time and effort to
fix her up and take care of her like she deserves.

She's a white and yellow/orange Type 2 Transporter, bay-window style.  She
has 3 major rust spots -- along the left side bottom body line between the
wheel wells, inside the right rear wheel well, and around the left rear
body panel.  There are minor rust spots and dings and dents all over;
she's been through it, whatever it was. :)

The PO let the old battery corrode so badly that it took me days of work
to get the cables off of it.  There's a new battery, but I haven't put the
cables on because the connectors are almost history.  I have new
connectors for the cables.  However, with a jumpstart, she ran just fine.
The engine was completely rebuilt about a year and a half ago.  The only
other major problem is that the parking brake doesn't work; the PO says
the cables are just detached, but I don't have the tools to take the brake
drums off to reattach them.

The PO did some interior modifications, including putting in a decent
aftermarket stereo, a cheapass little wooden console between the seats,
and turning one rear seat to the side to put in a small table.  He also
carpeted the whole interior.  I've put new light bulbs in all around the
outside.

Since she just needs a little to get her running, I'm asking $1000.
