Subject: Rocker Arm Studs

I'm trying to find a source for rocker arm studs for a 74 1.7 carb type 4
engine.  The engine is out of my 75 westy.  I've tried a lot of places with no
luck and am running out of ideas.  I checked the archives of this list and may
have one lead but I'm hoping there are others.  I'm about to just go to a
machine shop and have them make me one.  I found racing studs but they are for
type 1's.  Does anyone have any idea what width, pitch and lenght these studs
are??  Any help would be much appreciated.  I'm getting close to have my bus
together and not being able to find this part is getting frustrating.  Thanks.
Mark Fischer.
