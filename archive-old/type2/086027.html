Subject: Re: [T2] [friday] Regarding &quot;Deadhead/hippie&quot; buses... 

&gt;Being a selective luddite, I appreciate the &quot;modern&quot; features of the
&gt;Type 2 as well as its &quot;vintage&quot; owner-servicability...:-)

If they weren't *owner* servicable, they couln't have called them
Volkswagens... they would have had to call them &quot;Mechaniksvagens&quot;.

Later,
