Bob:
I've found that on really rusty old buses the only place I trust is the
torsion bar tubes, usually I use the cast steel ends of the tubes right below
where the arms come out. I do this to get the widest stance possible. Even
then, keep in mind that (with a loaf, anyway), this is getting pretty close to
the fore-aft center of gravity and MOST of the whole weight of the bus will be
on these two stands. So make sure your stands are up to it! No cheesy pressed
steel Chinese stuff! And make sure they are sitting on concrete or something
with good support.
And I do the same with the jack- leave it under the bus in the extended
position.
I often work alone.
While I know every man must die, I'd rather choose some other method than
slowly dying of a crushed chest struggling under a rusty old type 2- at least
I'd rather gloriously fly off some mountain road while trying to take a turn
too fast.
(Still crazy after all these years.)

&gt; &gt; Where would be the best spot to place jackstands on the rear of a bus?
&gt;
&gt; depending what I was working on.
&gt;
&gt; but
&gt;
&gt; 1. torsion tube recievers
&gt; 2. body frame
&gt; 3. side rails by jack recievers (if sound)
