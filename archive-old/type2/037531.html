It can cause an oil leak at the base of the filler, and or an exhaust leak
at the pass. side flange..  See my post earlier about this particular
indention..  I ended up just rearranging the metal to not contact the
filler tube.

Also, continued contact between the muffler and oil tube will probably
cause your oil temps to rise a bit.

Now, WHY does this hit?  Someones dies (can you say, Dansk?) for the rear
section of the muffler are way outta kilter, i think.  Oh, and the stud
holes are drilled and tapped not quite perpendicular to the flange...

&gt; under the fan belt -- the screw fell in the heater box. Is that going to
&gt; cause any problems?

No.  Just an annoying rattle that you likely wont hear anyway, at least
until it jams itself in among the fins.;)
