Subject: Starting on my T2

Well, this weekend I'm going to take the big leap and do my first ever car
repairs, on my 71 type 2 Loafbeast.  I'm going to be adjusting the clutch,
and reattaching the hand/parking brake cables to the rear brakes.  Oh, and
jumpstarting her dead battery. :)

I've got John Muir's book, and the Clymer VW Service &amp; Repair Handbook for
Transporter 61-72.

Do I need to know anything else before I get started?  Both of these jobs
seem pretty simple (assuming I don't have to replace the cables, and even
if I do, that doesn't seem too hard).  Any tips on jumpstarting a T2, for
someone who has never jumpstarted anything before? :)  (I noticed that
topic was missing from both books.)
