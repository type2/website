Ah yes, I've seen one of those. I never did get the point, though.

So I wrote:
Huh? The point? Where is your sense of adventure, man? I think there are 
at least a few points to the BAJA BUS.

1- With a BAJA BUS, you can get to lots of cool places in Baja that I wouldn't
dare try to reach in my mostly stock 78 Westy. Like Punta San Jose, Punta Blanca
, Punta Maria, Punta Canoas, etc. etc. It allows you to reach all kinds of 
bitchin' surfspots without the shame of pulling up in a Ford Bronco.
Why should the ORV crowd have all the fun?

2- It's quite the welding project. I know a welder and VW mechanic who made a 
few of these intriguing vehicles over the years. 

3- IT appeals to the desire (some have) to live the Sysyphian dream. You know,
the guy who gets to push a giant rock uphill all day every day, only to have it
roll back to the bottom every time he succeeds? Do you want a project car or a
PROJECT CAR? If you add big tires, you need more clearance. If you improve 
clearance, you need different drive shafts. Then you need a different gear 
ratio, then a bigger engine to take advantage of it, then a cooling system, 
then...
 
4- It raises your vulnerable legs even higher above the roadbed. Get rammed in
a BAJA BUS and the other car takes out your shocks, mondo tires, and drivetrain,
while you sit high and safe above the damage, your feet at about the other 
driver's eyelevel.

5- Why do people like VW's? Why do people dream of adventure? Why do tinkers
keep trying to improve on perfect designs? What's down that dirt road past the 
sand pit and the high clearance rock? The BAJA BUS is a direct descendent of 
Icarus, the guy who made wings and flew too close to the sun. They are part
and parcel of what makes people great.

That's all I can think of right now, but really, I think #1 is the main point. 
There are lots  of scary roads in Baja that simply aren't prudent to drive your 
regular, stock bus down. I've gotten stuck in the sand often enough to dream
of wider tires. But then I'd need to modify the wheelwells, and there I am at 
the top of that slippery slope described in #3.
