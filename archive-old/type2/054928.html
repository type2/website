&gt; &gt; 1. The vent windows in the front doors, do not open.  I mean they have no

&gt; Non opening quarterlights are quite common over here in the UK.  (I don't
&gt; know about Westy's specifically.)  - in fact they're probably much more
&gt; common than the opening kind.  (Mine are fixed)

hmmmm, wonder, did he notice which side of the bus the steering wheel was
