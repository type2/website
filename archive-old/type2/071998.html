&gt;I am going to replace my canvas and was thinking I would go with PLF-Dawn
&gt;Smith,  - Has anyone used or seen her product?


I am about to do some business with PLF:  Dawn snail-mailed me a swatch
with 7 different custom greens (including some nice tweed-like
patterns..... hard to choose, they are ALL fabulous)

The Sunbrella material impressed me as good and tough.  Also, PLF sent me
their small, but informative catalogue/pricelist.  I'm interested in some
of their other items, such as a heat retaining roll-up canvas &quot;wall&quot;
between the front seats and bus -- I'm often heating a lot of space
unnecessarily.

E-mail Dawn and ask her for some samples or her catalog.  The service has
been great for me, and I'm just waiting for a few more &quot;gotta pay&quot; bills to
clear, then it'll be time for my new canvas.

Roger
