How is the battery supposed to be tied down?? Mine's been bouncing
around loose for 7 years. I see what looks to be a spot for a threaded
rod? on the inboard side of the battery spot, and a lip on the outboard
side. Will a basic aftermarket L-rod setup work here?

Todd,

my battery has a protrusion on the bottom of it which locks into the lip that 
you refer to. On the inboard side there is a small rectangular metal plate 
(about 10cm by 15 cm i think) which bolts into the angled nut that you refer 
to. This effectively creates a (removeble) lip on the inboard side.

securing battery, in order to get vehicle registered)
