Subject: Re: [T2] re:help with idle and cold start


&gt;Any time disconected the hose from the aux air reg. to the air intake the 
&gt;bus stalled even when
&gt;the bus was running for a while and warm - seems like this means that it 
&gt;is not closing

B/c this constitutes a major vacuum leak I think. Right folks?

I spent the first couple of weeks with our Westy hunting for vacuum leaks. 
Ran terrible when I got it and great after those leaks were repaired.
