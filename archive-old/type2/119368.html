Subject: replacing window (et al.) seals

Hiya Everyone,

Been reading up on the various manuals, the sermons, and the mailing lists
trying to find some info on replacing standard seals.

I've got a '79 transporter with front/real/sliding door/sliding roof seals all
shot. They all need to be replaced :-(

I figured I should do this before attempting to follow the heating/soundproofing
of gmbulley.

Short of the window seals is this a pretty easy job? I mean is it just a scape,
new adhesive, and then new rubber?

Also, with the sliding roof... Has anyone opted out for a cheaper alternative
than the cost of the VW seal (~$179.00). I want to still be able to open/close
the window. I was thinking about felt weatherstriping and applying some adhisive...

Thanks,
Harry
