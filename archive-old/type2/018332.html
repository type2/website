Hello from beautiful Carmel, California!
Well I made it, and thanks to all of you who offered help if I needed
it, and of course the great advise. We left Atlanta Tuesday May 25, at
about 11pm.  Had a nice night drive to somewhere in western Alabama. 
The bus was running great, stopped for gas and she would not start. 
Nothing, not a crank... Decided that someone was telling me to stop and
get some sleep.  In the morning it started right up and off we went. 
Stopped at a rest area in Tennessee, and once again no start.  Grabbed
the voltmeter and checked the battery, less than 10 volts.  The battery
was about 5 years old, so I called AAA (best investment I have made for
the bus) told them I needed a jump start, the driver was there in about
10 minutes, I ahd already disconnected the battery cables and explained
that I needed to charge the battery for maybe 5 minutes and I was sure
it would start.  Sure enough it fired right up.  We stopped at an auto
zone in Franklin, TN bought a new battery, and were on our way.

Smooth sailing through the TN, OK spent the night on the far side of OK
city.  Went through where the tornado hit, impressive the force of that
one.  Ran into a good bit of thunder storm activity in west OK and east
TX.  Hit Amarillo about 5 and found a great vegetarian restaurant. 
Loved the time change into mountain time, gave us a chance to see a good
bit of the how beautiful New Mexico is.  Everything was great until
about 25-30 miles outside of Albuquerque NM, if you have driven into
Alb.. NM from the east you will understand the shear white knuckle
experience I had.  I40 is under construction in this stretch, and it
began to rain, hard! The little white lines on the road were virtually
non existent.  I was doing about 30-40 mph down the mountain, in
blinding rain, with incredible winds, and trucks zipping past at 75
mph.  The worst 30 minutes of driving in my life. But we made it.  Spent
the night in Grants, NM when the winds started to pick up and it looked
like more rain.  

The next day we had a nice drive to the Grand Canyon.  We lucked out, it
was Friday 5pm Memorial Day weekend and we got the last room in the
park, with a great second story view out over the canyon!  If you have a
chance to stay at the El Tovar at the Grand Canyon, do it is a great
experience.  The park is much different after sundown when the bulk of
the people leave.

Did and oil change on Saturday morning, preparing to cross the desert. 
The winds in western AZ were not to be believed, 30 mph sustained
gusting to God knows what. 5 hours of 50 mph, holding on to the wheel
for dear life driving in these bastard winds.  They died down a bit when
we entered the desert between Kingman, AZ and Needles, CA. Drove a nice
conservative 55 mph, it was hot! Made it to Needles, decided to stop and
let the sun go down before hitting the Mojave desert.  Spent and hour or
so outside a Denny's in the shade, with the wind blowing through the
open engine hatch.  Cool, and then no start.  Volts down around 10.  AAA
on the way! Same thing, started right up.  Haven't had the problem
since.

Nice night drive through the Mojave, made it to about 35 miles outside
of Barstow, when the winds picked up.  Decided to stop for the night in
Barstow, had enough of fighting the winds.  Had a wake up call for 6 am
(we stayed in hotels all but the first night, as we were being relocated
by the Company), on the road by 6:30.  The desert was nice and cool and
traffic was at a minimum.  Nice cruise into Carmel at about 1pm Sunday. 
Now we are moved into temp housing while we search for a rental house.  

The Coast here is heavenly, I do not see myself ever returning east!
