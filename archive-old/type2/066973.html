Went out to have a go at the 73 that will provide a &quot;new&quot; motor for 
Folly today.  The poor old thing is filthy... but changed the oil, 
checked the plug, poured in some fresh high octane gas... and with a 
minimum of coaxing, the pan cake engine roared into life.  I was sorely 
tempted to drive the 50 KM back home but the 73's transmission is shot!  
Couldn't make a gear grind.  BUT... the engine ran.  It sounded fairly 
smooth.  So i the next week I'll have it towed back to Sudbury, drop it 
out, clean it up and then install it in folly.  Lots more information to 
gather before that though.

Just thought you'd like to know.
