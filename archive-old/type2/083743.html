Subject: I have a clutch problem two.

I am also having a problem with my clutch in my 74. I
just had a 1.8 installed and when I push the clutch in
all of the way it doesn;t engage all of the way. I'm
not sure if the engine came out of another 74 or a 75.
Does this sound like a mismatched flywheel and stuff?
Thanks,
Tyler
