Subject: Re: Stock oil coolers &amp; seals

&gt;Time and time again, 
&gt;people visit my garage wanting a &quot;Dog House&quot; oil cooler on their pre 
&gt;1970 Bug. I am wondering if a late model oil cooler would work on an 
&gt;early case with the small oil holes on top of case where the cooler bolts 
&gt;on? If so, which oil cooler seals do I use?

Terry,

Yes, a late-model dog-house style oil cooler can be retro-fitted to the
early-model engines.

Somewhere in the archives, or perhaps in one of my articles, I've given all
the details for adding a dog-house cooler to an early engine.

Mechanically, there isn't much too it, although you need to drop the engine
to do the swap.  The oil cooler adapter bolts to the case, the late-model oil
cooler bolts to the adapter and away you go.  But like most things, success
is in the details.  You will need a dog-house-type blower housing, the 10mm
wider fan, new forward breast tin (for the exhaust ducting) and the exhast
ducting itself.  Local junk yards were charging $65 for all the necessary
tin-ware plus $35 for a USED oil cooler (the price is higher now).  If you do
not know the provenance of an oil cooler it is unwise to use it.  If it is
off a blown engine the oil cooler will have trapped a lot of metal particles
that will cause early failure of a good engine.  Best bet is to use a new or
rebuilt unit.

For a leak-free installation you need TWO sets of grommets (one for the
adapter, one for the cooler) so you'll need a post-71 gasket set,  or you may
be able to salvage grommets from the remnants of old gasket sets used to
install upright coolers.  Don't even think of using old grommets.  You need
the 'crush' of the new grommets to provide tension on the fasteners.  And
don't use any sealant on the grommets -- it will get squeezed out and end up
in either the cooler or your bearings.

The adapter -- available from Bug-pack or a junky -- dictates the type of
grommets (seals) you'll need.  In the overhaul gasket set there are two types
of grommets, one for early engines with the small hole, one for later models.
 The adapter dictates the OD the grommet, the crankcase the ID.  Dig through
the gasket set until you find the set that match your needs -- you'll be
looking for the THIN-WIDE grommets (those for a Type III engine are
THICK/WIDE... whatever you do, don't get them mixed up).  Be careful not to
over-torque when you install the adapter to an early case.  You will have to
replace the stud with a bolt of suitable length.  With the proper grommet
installed, the adaptor will come down flush on the crankcase.  This is where
you need to be careful.  IF you don't have the right grommets you're liable
to strip out the threaded bore for the bolt (ie, where the stud was) or even
break off one of the ears.  If the adapter is not flush the oil cooler will
be too high by that amount, causing a mis-fit of the blower housing, which
can lead to air-leaks, excessive vibration and so forth.  The different
grommets are illustarated in Tom Wilson's book 'How to Rebuild Your
Air-cooled Volkswagen Engine'.

Having a COMPLETE set of dog-house tin-ware is vital to the success of the
conversion. The piece of tin-ware most difficult to find is the little
bracket which bolts to the back of the oil cooler and provides the nut-plate
for securing the new blower-housing.  Don't leave this piece out.  It forms a
vital air-dam as well as serving to secure the 'flappy' part of the
dog-house.  Without it, you'll have a massive leak of cooling air and
vibrations from the unsecured blower housing will eventually cause the oil
cooler to loosen and leak.

I always install new foam rubber gaskets on the oil cooler.  They get torn
rather easily by removal of the blower housing and they have a critical role
- -- if the high pressure cooling air can find some way around the oil cooler,
it will.  The foam, in conjunction with the blower housing and 'dog-house',
 forms an air seal on the sides and top of the oil cooler.  The little
'mystery' bracket (that most people leave out), with a small piece of foam
attached, forms the air seal for the bottom of the oil cooler.  Without it
the oil cooler is only about 50% effective -- the air blows thru the gap.  If
you can't find this little piece of tin-ware you will have to fabricate
something to serve as the air-seal for the lower edge of the oil cooler.
 There are a number of ways to accomplish this but don't put your faith in
glued-on weather-stripping or the like -- it will come loose in time and may
block the oil cooler.

After-market tin-ware is especially bad when it comes to forming a proper
seal around the oil cooler.  I've a hunch the Taiwanese or Siamese or
whatever have never seen a properly assembled dog-house style blower housing
with all of the bits &amp; pieces properly installed.  For whatever reason,
after-market dog-house style tin-ware often leaves gaps of an inch or more
around the base of the oil cooler, defeating the whole purpose of the thing.

Sealing the exhaust ducting is equally important, not only where it attaches
to the dog-house and the back of the blower housing, but where it passes thru
the breast tin. I use RTV and literally glue the ducting in place.

Since you'll be replacing the breast tin, this is a good opportunity to
install a bulkhead fitting for the fuel line.  You'll find this covered in at
least two of my articles on the 'sermon' page.

The dog-house oil cooler, which is in fact an EXTERNAL oil cooler, represents
a vast improvement over the old-style up-right oil cooler.  The wider fan,
new blower housing and external exhaust serves to make the oil cooler circuit
entirely separate from normal engine cooling.
