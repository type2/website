Subject: Damn!!! Vice-Grips worked on CV Bolts!!!!!!!!

Hi all:

Got lots of replies to my &quot;rounded out Allen-head CV bolt&quot; problem.
 Nobody -except one person - really liked my idea of cutting a screw-head
slot in the head of the bolt and removing it that way.  The vast majority of
the replies advocated the use of Vice-Grips to twist the bolt off.  Since
most of those in the Vice-Grip camp stated they had used the method
personally with success, I bit the bullet and got some genuine Vice-Grips
and, gosh darn, it worked!  Got that sucker right off!

Thanks to everyone who helped me &quot;see the light.&quot;
