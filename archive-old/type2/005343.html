Subject: [T2] garage in Jacksonville North Carolina


&gt; Hello list,
&gt;
&gt; I wanted to see if any body has heard of a small vw
&gt; garage that is located in the entrance of
&gt; Jacksonville, North Carolina. The shop is called COX
&gt; MOTOR CO. I went to investigate the other day but it
&gt; was the weekend and they were closed. They had several
&gt; old bay windows, and many other old beetles, dune
&gt; buggies, ect. I don't know if they part out any of
&gt; these vehicles or if they were just for sale or what.
&gt; Let me know if any one has heard of them. I will have
&gt; to go investigate again when they are open.
&gt; Thanks for your time!
&gt;
&gt; David Kelly
&gt; from Wilmington, North Carolina
