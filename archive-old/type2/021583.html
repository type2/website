Subject: Not to beat a dead horse but...

Ok, I know the tires subject has been run into ground but all this talk
over the past week or two got me thinking.  I'll be buying tires very
soon.  Now I know the basics: load rating, max weight, max pressure,
etc. but I haven't read anything about rims (wheels.)
My '72 Westy is currently sitting on  205/70R14's.  I heard (possibly
incorrectly) that this size tire requires a different size rim than the
stock 185R14's.  Could that be true?  I believe in a lot of research
before making a major purchase such as tires and don't want to waste
this time pricing the wrong tires.  Whether this is true or not, should
I replace my tires with the same size tires and will switching to a
smaller tire increase speed/power?

Thanks,
-Paul
