ok...I'll try not to spoil it for Chris...

me and my friend Chris who is also on this list went and bought a bus
today for him.... its his second one....he would have emailed you all
and told you...but I'll do it since he's still at work...hehe!

Its a 1970 beige transporter....runs strong, interior is pristine!,
everything is great except it needs a new exhaust....and brake work
which we're doing this weekend...even has chrome trim!

He needed to buy a car this week since his bus isn't running and we were
driving down to his house to go to some junkyards for VW stuff and
spotted it at Connie's Import Repair shop....the AWESOME VW guy in our
area who has a barn full of V-dub stuff
 500 bucks it said on the windshield...
he offered him 400... ok!  we went and got the cash.... he went to
work...and I dropped off his cash
then I realized that his sunglasses and cell phone were in my car/house
yet!  haha chris!

oh yeah.... I got a JUST LIKE NEW oil bath air cleaner today that
someone must have spilled oil all over and preserved the thing because
it has almost NO rust and all the original orange VW stamping and
writing....its complete! (what is this thing worth??) I got the panels
(blue and light blue) that go behind the drivers and passengers seats,
and the handle that goes back there too! and the little black plastic
air duct that goes behind the drivers seat to get air from inside the
door to the rear of the bus...
all for a grand whopping total of..... 10 bucks!!! wow!
i was pleased...
although I was originally looking for shifting parts....anyone have
those??

Karl??  you said you could find them??  please do!  I have money for
you...

oh yeah....and today i was monkeying with my points connectors in my
dist. and gashed my thumb open....damn sharp connectors!!  I went inside
to wash it out....started feeling a little woozy....vision was going
black...and decided to go and lay on the couch....well...i didn't make
it there in time.... I dropped to the floor in .2 seconds..ha...layed
there for 10-20-30 min?? and got up with sweat just pouring and dripping
off my face and arms....really!  It was dripping off me!  Nobody was
home ....good thing... my parents would have freaked out and called the
hospital or something.... I looked wasted...smashed... and dead for a
while....I'm still out of it.. so if this email makes no sense...thats
why!

ok..
done...
don't want to spoil Chris's thing...
