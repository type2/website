Subject: Re: [T2] Engine-neering - combustion chamber question



&gt; Isn't it combustion that forces the piston to move. If this 
combustion
&gt; continued in the exhaust imagine what the emisions levels would
&gt; be.

Subaru had special stainless inserts in the exhaust ports to withstand 
the added heat from the air injection, which burned off the leftover 
hydrocarbons.  Combusting the exhaust lowers the levels.

I suspect that VW was doing the same things and went to stainless 
pipes to get reasonable life.
