Subject: [T2] Re: Bus Tow bar

Have you tried to do that local? Lots more expensive.
Also, they want you to have a class three hitch, which
I'm too cheap to put on my POS Isuzu P/U. (P/U in more
ways than one.) I've rigged up a system similar to one
that I read about in the archives of this list, gonna
test it on my bus tonight, and put it to use tomorrow.

Thanks for all your suggestions, folks.
