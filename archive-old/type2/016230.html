Ive been thinking of buying a MIG welder for some while, and I've had a 
recommendation from a couple of professional welders to get the one JC 
Whitney sells for $339, including the gas regulator. One fellow (who is on 
the T_at_ list, I think) uses this one in preference to an expensive industrial 
one for anything in its capacity.

One advantage is that it has 6 settings up to its 100 amp (30% duty cycle) 
capacity. Most smaller ones have at most 4 settings. Another advantage is 
that you will get a 15% discount if you merely ask for it when ordering by 
phone.

I have decided on that one when I make the move, but YMMV.

Cheers/Carron
