&gt;NOOOO!!! Not the extra set of keys!

&gt;Sooner or later some punk is going to open your engine lid looking for

Trust me.
Won't happen.

He has to open the engine lid?
See that other box over there.
Decide to look at the battery in the box; which one??
Drag out the box?
Undo the strap that fastens down the lid.
Discover it is not a battery.
and then, just where exactly in that non-battery box is that key???
Hmmmmm ?!?!?.
Sure don't see a key in there !?!?!?

If someone is gonna steal my bus, he will take a different route, only 
to discovery that no matter what he does, he can't seem to get the 
starter to turn over,
and then when he pushes the bus, there just won't be any ignition firing.

Relays, Relays, Relays !!!
