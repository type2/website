Subject: Re: [T2] 65 mph expectations and head question (loss of power)

&gt;Is 65 mph realistic for a 71 Westy (1600 DP) Rebuilt Engine, new heads
&gt;installed with all tin and rubber? I'd like to be able to obtain that?
&gt;

well 65 if your speedo is true and your tires are the same as stock should 
be fine.
Thats the VW recommended speed. If you are struggling to get that speed
something is wrong.
