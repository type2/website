Multiple carbs should be synchronized at idle with all the throttle linkage
disconnected.

Then the linkage should be connected and synchronized.  If properly done,
there will be no change in readings, at idle, with the linkage connected or
disconnected.  With any wear in the throttle shafts this can be an exercise
in _extreme_ frustration.

Finally, an attempt should be made to synchronize the carbs off-idle at
~2,000-2,500 RPM.

In reality, it's almost impossible to accomplish all these goals without
some compromising along the way.  Even brand new engines and carbs can be
very difficult to synchronize at all 3 levels.  And if you recheck the idle
and linkage synch after doing the off-idle synch you'll probably find you
need to start all over again.

In the end you just have to get familiar with your particular engine and
induction system, decide where to be meticulous and where to &quot;fudge&quot; a
little, and press on regardless.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Does not the proceedure for sycronizing the carbs call for it to be done
at a steady RPM of between 2000 and 3000 RPM, rather than at idle?  &lt;&lt;
