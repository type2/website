&gt;I know everyone swears by this stuff (POR-15)...anyway, I want to undercoat 
&gt;the bottom of my bus.  So, I have a few questions:
&gt;
&gt;1. How much will I need?
&gt;2. I know that once you open a container, it is only good for so long...how 
&gt;long?

Missy:

Make sure you scrape off as much of the old undercoating as possible before you put the POR-15 on.  As for opening the containers and having a limited life, I usually buy the &quot;6-packs&quot; of POR-15.  A six-pack is just 6 small jars of POR-15. It costs about the same as a 1-quart can, but the cumulative amount of the 6 jars is less than a quart.  However, I think it's actually a better deal than buying a quart, because you end up not wasting nearly as much POR-15 when it comes in small jars.  Also, the small jars are made of plastic and have screw tops instead of the typical paint can press-on lid.  This method of storage means that you'll be able to use virtually all of the POR-15 in each jar.  

As for what you should coat?  Since POR-15 is much more expensive than undercoating stuff, if money is an issue, I'd use the POR-15 on the stuff that's bolted onto the underside of the bus, i.e. trailing arms, tie-rods, brake booster, pitman arms, etc.  3M sells a nice quality undercoating in airosal cans, which I've used on other vehicles and have been very happy with.  I'd stay away from brush-on undercoatings, since they are a mess and very difficult to work with.
