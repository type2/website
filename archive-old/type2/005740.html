I don't know if ASI/Riviera had such an item, but I have seen an awning such
as you've described on a couple of baywindow poptop Rivieras.

The one that stands out in my memory was powered by a Porsche 911 6-cyl.,
with a Porsche 5-speed transaxle.

&gt;&gt;  Wasn't there a cool option on Rivera's for an awning that was housed
under the pop-top affixed to the inside of the fiber-glass  -  when the top
is up it rolled out from underneath the pop-top over the top of the rain
gutter, then attached to poles and guy-wires?  I've heard about them but
never seen them.  Maybe there's an aftermarket product that could be rigged
to do the same?  &lt;&lt;
