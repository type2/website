Subject: Re: [T2] Road trip confirmed: Leaving Anaheim, CA for Denver,
  CO

Good luck Don.

The good thing about taking your bus is you know how
to work on it.  I did a road trip with my 69' bus when
I was in my 20's, after graduating from college, but I
went from Davis, Ca. to Alaska, when most of the AlCan
Highway was gravel, over to Maine, then back to SoCal
via Needles mid-day in summer.  Like you I was alittle
uncomfortable about taking my bus, but I knew if
anything happened I could probably fix it.  The only
things I did to my bus on that trip was to adjust the
points, valves and oil changes.  Man I love my bus.

Have fun,

rudy

&gt; Oh, man... I'm so nervous. I haven't done ANY cross
&gt; country driving....
