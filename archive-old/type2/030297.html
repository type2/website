Some have said that moth balls are useful.  Certainly it would be a good
idea to close up obvious entrance routes, but mice are skinny little
critters.

Mousetraps do work, and I have better luck with peanut butter than the
traditional cheese.  You have to check them periodically, though.

This is one time that I think that a good hungry alleycat would be a good
thing to have.
