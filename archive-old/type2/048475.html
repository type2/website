Subject: [T2] Stock heat exchgrs, just how good are they?

Hi folks,

Well, it's starting to get cold here and although I don't plan on driving my camper much in the winter months, I would like to take it 
once in a while.  So I have a stock 1600 dp with NOS heat exhangers from
The Bus Depot,  since I've never really driven my camper yet I was 
wondering how well they work when temps get down into the teens.  My
camper(70 Westy) isn't perfect in the door seal area but I plan on fix-
ing that soon.  Should I bring a sweater for city driving and long
sleeve shirt for the highway?  All the ducting under the bus is in great
shape and I have the belly pan.

Just curious.

Derek Miller
