Klahd13_at_aol_dot_com says about pulling dents with dry ice:

&gt; Really?  Sounds cool...How do you do that?

It's a variation on the old &quot;heat shrink&quot; trick bodymen have used for ages,
and it probably only works with very small dents. Just get some dry ice and
rub the dent with it; if it's small enough it should come out.

The classic way to heatshrink requires a rosebud tip on your oxyacetylene
torch, a bucket of water and a sponge. Heat the dent to a dull red then
quickly wipe across it with the wet sponge. Recommended first step: sand the
paint off.
