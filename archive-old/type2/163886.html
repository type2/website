Subject: Re: [T2] Adjusting FI mixture without an EGA

Well, this is sort of embarrassing.  I had recently checked by aux air
regulator and it seemed good.  However, when I checked it again today,
it is obviously not.  The engine was stone cold but the regulator more
*mostly closed*.  It wasn't totally closed but, only a sqare-ish area
was open.  I tried adjusting it but it was adjusted as far open as it
would go.  I'm guessing that it's not always closing properly either.
Oh well, time to replace it.  If anyone has a good spare?

Till I get that straightened out, there is no sense in messing with
the AFM any more.
