Subject: Re: CB antenna on a westy roof

Yeah, but at 2 meters, the plate and magmount atre a big enough groundplane - 
for 11 meters (CB), you almost need to have a metal top, or at least the 
&quot;package tray&quot; on a westy over the driver (or back bed in older ones) has to 
have a metal plate put in with the antenna in the center of it -  otherwise, 
your SWR is going to be high.  I know, I had this prob. with lily, and the 
plate did good.
