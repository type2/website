I searched the archives and found someone had asked my question, but found
no answer.  Please read 2 litre owners.  I am holding 2 sections of small
gauge hoses--each a &quot;T&quot; configuration. That is- 2 T's leave me 6 hose ends
to connect to &quot;somethings.&quot;  The choices are dizzy, air cleaner box, fuel
pressure regulator, throttle valve, decel valve, and one other
thing-a-ma-jigee. When I dropped the motor, not all of these hoses were
connected to anything, but it ran great. I would REALLY appreciate it if one
of you gurus would pmail this relative-novice and explain what connects to
what. I'd be stoked even if one of you with a bone-stock 77 would have a
look-see at yours and fill me in.  My manuals(Muir, Bentley, Wilson) left
this out completely and though I cant believe it, it wasn't in the archives.
Thank You!
