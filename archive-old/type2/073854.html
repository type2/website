Jim,
Yep, it is---read the later message I posted direct from the VW pro
training manual----
And it is volume / delivery I was talking about not pressure.

I don't care if a guy was a master mechanic--the Bentley is so vague on
so many things it's ridiculous.
It takes the word simple, and complicates it.

Terry Kay sends: 
Pull the fuel line off at the engine side of the pump, and put the hose
into a coffee can. 
Have someone turn on the ignition, and you will find out real quick if
you have a fuel from the pump / filter problem. 
And this is going to tell you there's enough pressure in the system how?
Even if the fuel pump would pump with just the ignition on, which it's
not supposed to. There is a reason for the starter being part of the FI
system. 
This check is fine with carbs (3 psi fuel pressure needed). Your FI bus
needs 28 psi +/- 2 psi. I don't know where you get your coffee cans
from, but mine don't have fuel pressure gauges on them. 
There's a misconception about Bentley: it's not designed to teach you
how to fix a car if you don't know how. It's designed to provide someone
who knows how to fix a car the procedures necessary to fix the
Volkswagen Bus. Muir is for someone who doesn't know how to fix a car.
