&gt;Its good that you are clear in stressing that for you_personally_driving a

&gt;plenty of room to spare because it is well maintained and all emmission 
&gt;control systems are in place.

&gt;Driving a type 2 and placing priority on clean air are not mutually 
&gt;exclusive, its a personal decision to make them so.

ok... it's fair to say that as bus owners and people on this planet we 
should be responsible and make the air as clean as possible.  First of 
all clean air, for me, is not on &quot;low priority&quot;.  i never said that. I 
said that it wasn't my &quot;biggest priority&quot;.  If it was I would be driving 
a 2003 vw beetle (diesel fuel of course).  In deciding not to install an 
EGR filter I did not leave mother nature completey absent of my decision 
making calculous.  Like yourself I pass the emissions tests with plenty 
of room to spare, no problem.  However the irony of both our claims is 
that EGR lowers NOx and oregon, just like here and so many other places, 
probably isn't requiring that.  if it is than I guess you're lucky.

I'm just not convinced that EGR has a signicant impact.  I invite 
anybody to prove me otherwise.  Show me the graphs.  I understand the 
science and the design and frankly I wish it did.  If  I did take a step 
to make the car more smogable than I would put on a cat converter.  As 
was previously mentioned this is also illegal but it would do a much 
better job than EGR.
