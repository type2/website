And your point is???

I have yet to have seen good quality aftermarket safari windows.  The nicest
I've seen appear to be Izzy's, but I haven't bought a pair and installed
them.  What I liked about them was the latches are the same as the 
originals, instead of hacked up repop vent-wing latches.

Are you selling a pair, or repoping them, or what?

I have a set of Wolfgang ones now, and they _suck_.  Last weekend I
discovered that one of the spot welds holding the frame together
popped, letting the bottom part of the frame sag.  

Other people I've talked to seemed to be OK with these; I guess I'm a little
more quality concious.  I have ~$7k into my bus, and I really don't like
using crappy stuff.
