Subject: ? good way to clean a bus

Problem is a bus that's been stored outside for years:

The body paint should compound up nicely, but I first have to get years and 
years of dirt and generic grime off of it else it'll just act as an abrasive. 
The inside of the engine bay suffers from the accumulation of oil, dirt, dirt 
mixed with oil, oil mixed with dirt, etc. The underside of the bus suffers 
from the accumulation of all the above. The bus isn't located next to a water 
faucet, so using any those spray on, wait, and then hose off cleaners is not 
possible - anyways I want to take the time to really give the bus a really 
good cleaning before starting to restore/work-on it. 

Also how do you clean a spare engine block, transmission, tin, etc. that are 
completely &quot;gunked&quot; up?

I've tried:
1. soapy water, towels and sponge - not good enough
2. those green (teflon?) scrub pads - work great with soapy water but 
the pad leaves very fine scratches in the paint
3. a generic 3M spray foam cleaner - seems to leave a thin greasy film and 
just doesn't cut the baked on oil/grease/gunk

Suggestions appreciated

Vespas in need of restoration.
