&gt; Being that this is flat autoglass, can this be cut
&gt; by a glass shop, or must I search high and low for
&gt; a replacement glass piece?  

Can they cut tempered glass?  Well, you could always make
the transition to safety glass (the kind with the two
panes and foil between them), that they can cut.

&gt; Also, I welcome any creative solution, whether it
&gt; be a source for a replacement or ?????

Ever thought about plexiglass (acryl)?  Might withstand
impacts of firewood better.
 
Airhowlingly yours,
