Subject: Help! Bus broke down!

HELP.  My bus broke down and I am pretty sure it is the clutch cable.  The
clutch cable is all frayed where it ties into the clutch and there is only
one strand connected.  Is this hard to replace and does anyone have any
pointers on how to do the job?  It broke down at a store and they want it
off the property today, so time is of the essence.  Any advice would be
greatly appreciated.
Thanks!

Phillip Freund
