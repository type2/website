Subject: Here are some things, questions, bus for sale.

Hey.  As I write this, my bus sits outside with the mileage: 99869.
Every day I see it getting closer to 00000.  It's tired.  Needs a
clutch, a wheel cylinder, the oil leak fixed, maybe a rebuild.

    So here's some questions.  How do I know if this is the original
engine?  It had air-conditioning that looked pretty original, but I
don't know.  Also, how can I tell if it's 1 hundred or 2 hundred
thousand?

    OK, here's some more.  I've been looking at this 73 hightop camper.
Last summer I got the guy down to $700, but I didn't have that kind of
cash.  I figure it could go to $500 this year.  It's a 73 with a gas
heater and a refrigerator.  It's all there, just used well.  What
worries me is the engine.  It's an upright.  I had a 68 with an upright,
but it sure didn't look like this.  The engine compartment has been
sealed with sheet metal, from the engine to where the engine seal would
be.  My bus had a stock metal plate to keep out the air and fill the
hole.  This 73 also has two pieces of duct work coming from in the air
scoops and running down to the firewall to direct air right at the
block.  All that, and it needs a clutch.

    I'm looking to buy this and drive it ASAP so I can start fixing the
77.  I figure I could drive the 73 right through winter because it has
this gas heater.

    So, in the expert opinion of yous guys, do I want to take this thing
on?  Is the extra sheet metal a sign of overheating?  It is much less
rusty than my 77.  The sliding door works.

    I'm just indecicive.  Just tell me what I should look at before I
cash in all the money I have.

    Here's the bus for sale part.  Blue and white 72, tries to be a high
top, tries to be a camper, but I wouldn't call it either.  It has a high
fiberglass top, but there's no bed, and it slopes down to form a roof
rack on the back.  (I say there's no bed, but maybe there could be the
stretcher thing in there)  It's sans rust, which is a rarity here, but
it's from the carolinas.  It has no interior past the front seats as far
as I could tell.  I don't know what engine it has.

    The man in the shop said the owner wants $2000.  I tell you what, if
I had $2500, I'd buy the 72 AND the 73, swap interiors, swap tops, and
sell the 73 shell with the 72 top.  But I don't.  Anyone know how I can
raise $2000 real quick (other than sell my 77)?

    So if anyone wants the info on that bus, pmail me.

Well, that's all.  Thanks for listening, eh?
