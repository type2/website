Hi every body !!

This is regarding Bus Nut's request on how to iddle PDSIT's double carbs.
Bellow, you can find a  message that Jens Vagelpohl sent me once.  I have
a 1973 Transporter with a 1700cc engine and he gave me some tips that I
really appreciate a lot and hope it could help you out too.

Regards,

Hey Pedro,
to be honest, not all type 4 engines are the same. those type 4 engines
(in
411 and 412 models) that were carburated used a different carburator than
you have on yours. i remember type 3s used that 34 PDSIT as well, and 1.6
liter beetles. the setup you have in your van is for buses only, which
obviously have different needs looking at their larger weight, higher wind

resistance and so forth. they were designed to produce more torque for
hauling, but not more high-end power like the type 4 sedans and wagons
needed.

since here in the US all type 4s are fuel-injected i don't really have
experience with dual carb setups. the only advice i have for you is of
general nature. adjusting carbs by ear (as i always did on the beetles i
owned) can only work if the other adjustments on the engine (valve
clearance, ignition points, spark plug gaps) are in order and you need to
make sure the engine is fully warmed up so that any cold-start mechanisms
on
the carbs have stopped working and can't interfere with the normal idle.

the way you usually go about adjusting carbs should work with dual carbs
as
well. you use the central idle speed control to adjust the engine to a
higher-than-normal idle (1000-1200 rpm). then you concentrate on the
mixture
richness screws, starting on the left carb. screw it in, slowly, until the

idle starts to fall down. back the screw out about 1/2 - 3/4 turn. repeat
the same on the right side. after that adjust the idle speed to the normal

level (750-850 rpm) and you should be all set. testing the setup with some

professional machinery (a CO-meter to see how rich the engine is running)
is
recommended.

Jens.

&gt; Hey Y'all,
&gt;   I am triing to get my 73 Bus running right and am having to put a
&gt; new valve in #3. I have found out that the heads are 2.0L and beleive
&gt; the engine is 2.0L(new P's &amp;C's) even though the case is a 73 Auto
&gt; case(CD). My problem is that I don't know what gasket kit to buy. Bus
&gt; Depot lists 1 for the 1.7, 1 for the 1.8 and 1 for the 2.0. What kit
&gt; do I get? What is the difference?
&gt;   Once I get the engine back together I will try again to get it
&gt; running right. Any advie on where to start getting the rebuilt carbs
&gt; set right. It won't idle now and runs crappy. I assume some of that
&gt; will be fixed with the new valve. I would love any tips on setting the
&gt; carbs, they are the stock 32-34 PDSIT's.
