&gt;I put it together this morning and it only has 
&gt;9 of the 10 longer male/female ended gold poles. So, I only have one of the 
&gt;two pieces to go from the front to back side along the top center of the 
&gt;tent.
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone have a pieced tent I can get this piece from? Or, has anyone 
&gt;found a suitable replacement for this piece? Copper tubing? EMT conduit?

Check the &quot;Got Pole Problems?&quot; heading at http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/vw/loaves.html for some ideas.  I'd guess conduit's strong enough.  Follow the 
canopy masters link at that URL and you'll find lots of solutions.  I've seen an occasional set of canvas-less poles for sale on eb*y.  Another one to check with is JP 
Henriksen (sp?) on the vintagebus list - he made a nice set of homebuilt poles for his Privy tent and may have some suggestions.

&gt;Also: a few of the rubber loop cords which hold the top of the tent to the 
&gt;framework are missing. Are there replacements for these? I've seen mini 
&gt;bungee cords which I think might do the trick, but repop or OEM styles might 
&gt;be best.

I don't think anyone's repopping *anything* for the original _Westy_ tents -- I think Dawn/PLF was repopping sundial/riviera tents but that's all I know of.  For the 
rubber loops, I think a piece of rubber tubing tied/glued/&quot;welded&quot; together at the ends would look really close.

My prob has been more with the plastic hooks on said rubber loops - they break off.  I have a bag of metal S hooks I carry with the tent and just use those as needed 
until I can find something more apropos.  The hooks would be a nice thing to find oem/repro.
