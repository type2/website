&gt; As you are driving, no matter what and no matter where... watch as the car
&gt; in front of you passes some fixed point (a mile marker, a dash in the line
&gt; in the road, etc..  Count (slow, full second count)  to three.  If you
&gt; have passed that same point before you reach three, then you are too damn
&gt; close! Drop back!!!!!

Not a bad rule of thumb.  this will work until the speeds exceed those of
a very fast bus.  Faster and you need more time, since stopping distances
go up much faster than speed.
