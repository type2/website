&gt;&gt;If so, and if you have a digital camera, I am dying to know where this idler
&gt;&gt;pulley assembly goes.  The PO removed it to put new bearings in, and never
&gt;&gt;reinstalled it or the a/c compressor, thus my current situation!
&gt;
&gt;I don't understand your question.  Are you talking about a type4-powered 
&gt;bus?  A type 4 car (hopefully not since this is a bus list)?  The bus 
&gt;installation has no idler pulley for the A/C.  If your bracket has an idler 
&gt;pulley attached, it did not originally come from a bus.  My '73 Capri had 

The Vanagon has an idler pulley and uses 2 belts.  Somewhat superior
to the bus install.  Unfortunately I pulled mine off so I can't say how it
went
for certain, but my pulley/bracket is intact.
