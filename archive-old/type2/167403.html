Subject: Re: [T2] bus goes airborne

Hi Gerry,

If it was empty it probably did OK. The suspension is built a LOT  
stronger than most other vehicles of the same size. The water landing  
would also have absorbed some of the energy of impact.

If it was loaded to capacity I think it would have broken something.  
But in that case it wouldn't have accelerated nearly as fast as it  
did, so it would never have caught air without a much longer run at  
the jump.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
