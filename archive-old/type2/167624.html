&gt; A decent Mig set up should have at least 60-80% duty cycle.

the Lincoln 100 has about a 40% duty cycle, but that is still faster than
I am

&gt; It no good for much more than 16 ga. sheet metal,and that'll be for
&gt; not much more than stitch or spot welding.

well if you take your time it does much heavier work, I've done decent
frame welding slow but decent welds

&gt;
&gt; &lt;&lt; the quality of the weld is much more the skill of the weldor than
&gt; anything else.&gt;&gt;
&gt; Huh--
&gt; A Weldor.

welder - the machine
weldor - the man/woman using the machince

&gt; You can give a guy with 50 years experience one of the 110v Lowe's, Home
&gt; Depot  consumer low duty cycle welder's and he'll lay beads that  looks
&gt; like pigeon droppings on a bridge beam .

I've seen proof otherwise (not me)  when all you have is 110v you use what
you have.
