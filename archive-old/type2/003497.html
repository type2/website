&gt;worker) clued me in that using a manifold/heatexchanger from an earlier bus
&gt;(he has a 74) would fit OK to the later 78 heads, but you have to get the
&gt;early muffler also, with the 4 connections for the heater/manifolds.  He
&gt;said the only reason they went to the separate manifold/upipes/heaterbox
&gt;(read more places to leak) was to accomodate the insertion of the catalytic
&gt;for California.   Ron Salmon verified this should work, having gotten it
&gt;&gt;from AVP

Been there, done that of course.  One important thing to note, although I've
said it many times that nearly any T4 Bus exhaust will fit on any T4 Bus
('79 the only exception of course with square port heads) there is a slight
obnoxious kicker to doing this.  That is the fact that the tubes up to the
heater flapper boxes changed contour.  I'm not sure without looking but if I
had to guess I'd say '72-'74 use a round shaped joint at the heater box and
'75-'78 use an oval joint.  And with these already very tough to fit right
on aftermarket Dansk boxes, you need the right parts.  So anyone considering
this conversion would be wise to find the heater parts as well.  I like the
'72-'74 system better for other reasons, the header and U tube arrangement
also has the tendancy to bend in over the years disaligning the heater boxes
and making muffler installation a PITA.  In addition I think the early ones
might heat marginally better as well, plus the exceptionally high quality
Dansk OEM replacement '72-'74 style muffler is available for the early
system.  One more note that strikes me, there is a possibility that the
under cylinder tins are different as well for these boxes, damn good one as
I consider it but I'm not sure.  So all in all my rec is to do this swap,
and it is a good one, make sure you can find a donor Bus for the pieces you
need and will not have.  To be considered as well is the fact there are
still plenty of useable header/U tube sets laying around junkyards, even
here in the salt belt if you look, more of them than '72-'74 heater tubes
and cylinder tins in my estimation.
