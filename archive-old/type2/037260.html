Subject: SlidingCurtainPlasticClips

I have been looking, for sometime now, for those little white 
plastic rings that fit into the aluminum track and allow the curtain
that covers the window in the sliding door, to slide back and 
forth.  They are small plastic rings with a slotted piece on one
side that allows them to fit into the track and slide back and forth
in the track.  Does anyone know of a source for these rings?
I have sent e-mails to the usual sources with no luck yet..  Thanks.
