Subject: Vent Wing Adjusting

Hiya All,

When I painted the Duck last year I redid all the window seals.  Looked great 
but the rear vent (driver's side if it makes any difference) leaks.  The 
seals themselves seem to be OK.  The problem is that the glass does not completely 
close at the top which allows the water in.  Are these things adjustable in 
any way?  If not - anyone with suggestions, experience, or advice they'd care 
to share?

Mike
