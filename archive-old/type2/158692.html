Subject: Re: [T2] tuneups and gas mileage. - 77 Westy

Hi Courtney,

Short hops are brutal to gas milage. IIRC John Kolak found that his  
bus was getting 4MPG a couple years back, because he was driving it  
exclusivey for 1-mile local hops. According to VW's service manual  
that qualifies as &quot;severe operating conditions&quot; because the engine  
never fully warms up. They advise to change the oil every 30 days or  
sooner! And at that rate it would be less than 100 miles on the oil.

If you aren't spending much time in 4th gear then the engine is  
turning more revs per mile travelled. That is also gonna hurt your  
milage.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
