&gt; Parts Express has a great deal on  some closeout Blaupunkt speakers.  I
&gt; think the 5 1/4's were  $35/pair and the 6x9's $56.  And they're marine
rated.

Not familiar with those (or any) particular speakers, but there's a few
online
sources for figuring out the appropriate sizes for boxes. Most speakers sound
better when boxed, either ported or not... ;-)
