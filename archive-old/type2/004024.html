Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Further to Brake Drums, etc...

George,

I neither saw these plates when I dismantled the brakes, nor was I issued
any with the pads... Ron has the front-brake hardware kits on B.O... perhaps
I should have waited?

And Ian, brother, I have no idea whatsoever what you're talking about.  I
suspect it was humor at my expense, but my wife occasionally accuses me of
being dense.  Sorry.

&gt; One thing that wasn't mentioned was the anti-rotation plate for the
&gt; piston.  This is a thin sheet metal plate that goes between the pad and
&gt; the piston with two tabs that keep the piston in the proper position.  The
&gt; piston has a cutaway section that ensures that one side of the pad touches
&gt; before the other, which is also a squeak-reduction measure, IIRC.  If the
&gt; plate is missing, or its tabs are squished flat, the wrong end of the pad
&gt; might be touching first.

&gt;Lastly, at the risk of beating a dead horse, how exactly would a faulty
&gt;caliper cause the &quot;wah-wah&quot; sound?
&gt;Hold caliper in left hand. Place trumpet to lips. Hold left hand (with
&gt;caliper) over bell of trumpet. Play. Move left hand away from bell and
&gt;back. Result: wah wah sound. Just tried it. Works, but not too well, and
&gt;your arm will tire quickly. Rubber plunger probably still better.
