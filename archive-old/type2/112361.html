Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Heat riser repair

Hiya George,

&quot;They don't seem to be
replacable and new manifolds don't seem to be in the offing. &quot;

Perhaps I am misreading this (if so, please disregard), but I take this to 
mean that new/replacement manifolds for a 1600 dp are not to be had.  On the 
contrary I have purchased (from my FLAPS) three piece replacement intake 
manifolds.  IMHO, a big improvement over the stock version for a couple of 
reasons.  One, the heat riser tubes are two separate pieces which are 
inserted into the cast centerpiece carb platform.  When needed, they can be 
removed and cleaned much easier than the stock setup.  And the throat in the 
centerpiece is somewhat larger than stock.  Claude's Buggies (the originator 
of this design) claimed 4 more horsies from this type manifold.  I couldn't 
verify that, but I did replace a 34PICT3 on a stock manifold with a 30/31 on 
a 3-piece manifold and noticed no drop in performance at all.  The 
centerpiece even has a spot for tapping in a large (or small if you want) 
vacuum nipple to allow for the brake booster in the 71.

Mike
