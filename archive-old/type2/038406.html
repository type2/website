Greets -

Also consider the gear ratios of the various model years. The 68-71 had
these 5.375 R&amp;P ratios that make the engine turn around 3700 rpm _at_ 60 mph.
&gt;From 72-75 (me thimks) the R&amp;P went to 4.86 (3300 rpm), and the 76-? 4.37
R&amp;P (.88 4th) lowered it slightly to about 3250 rpm.

Up to 68-70 used 1600 single port upright motors. 71 used the 1600 dual
port. 72 on up used 1700-2000cc type IV motors.

Thru 70 used drum brakes up front. 71-72 used the first generation disks.
73-? had bigger, beefier disks.

Of the upright motored busses, the 71 was probably the &quot;best&quot;, seeing as it
had the disks up front. Of the pancakes motored bussessess, I'd probably go
with a 2-liter (76 and up?), due to the higher final gearing. Then I'd go
looking for a Carerra motor... but that's a Friday thing.

Good luck!
