Subject: Re:cool air intake

-------------------------------------
At some point this week I will be installing a set of
dual Kadrons.and was thinking it would be a good idea 
to use something like this:
http://www.performance-air-filters_dot_com/cold-air.html
and have the intake snake up above the battery tray's
and sit just insidethe air scoops thus getting FRESH
unheated air...
If I do this it will be on a Type 4 2L motor
-------------------------------------------
On the new Vee dubs (fuel infected) you can get some
gain in HP by doing this.. however on my 74 if the
preheater hose gets loose my carbs ice up.
  I think the only thing you need to do is look into
how you would handle that.. or if the Kadrons would
ice up... 
  I have often wondered how I could open up the air
flow to my stock Solex set and avoid the iceing
problem. Havent figured it out yet.
