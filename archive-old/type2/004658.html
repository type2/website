About six months ago I put new kick panels in my 79 Loaf and they came flat
&gt;from TMI. As you install them, they will bend to a degree.  Be care full
not to break them. If you have the old one's, the best thing to do I found
out, is to practice a couple of times taking the out and reinstalling them.
Also, important note, if you got these kick panels from TMI, check to see if
the holes are punched through for the couple of screws you will need to hold
them against the floor heater vents.
