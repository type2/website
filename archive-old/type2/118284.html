&gt;&gt; really got me mystified, as soon as it cools off I will go out and
&gt;&gt; pull a plug or two see if they are wearing or over carboned.

&gt;&gt; Did you say you had replaced the plug wires?


&gt; not yet
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Cap and rotor?

&gt; not yet
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Condensor?

&gt; no condensor, pertronix
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; didn't touch it yesterday, this morning ran fine  _at_#$^%**%#!!!!!

&gt; I hate intermitteent problems

&gt; Bob

if it sometimes runs fine I'd tend to think it was less likely that it
was wires, cap or rotor but possible.

It still might be the cap allowing moisture in there and not totally 
giving you a consistent problem.

What's a petronix?  Is it replaceable?  Is it pricey?
