Subject: Starter?

Any help would be appreciated!- I have a 1968 manual bus with a 1600sp. 
The starter has been funny, when I first got the bus, I would turn the
key and it would click, but not start, after a few trys it always
cranked properly.  Then it started to struggle more and more every time
I turned the key, until finally it would not start.  All i get now is a
little bit of cranking and a dimming of the idiot lights.  Now Bad
starter?  Note: i recently installed a new electric fuel pump, this is
when the starter got worse, the pump was 5 pds and I believe the carb
takes 2, so I could have hydrolocked the engine?  I have now installed a
pressure regulator so thats solved, but it still wpnt start.  SO----
whats going on!  Thansk!
