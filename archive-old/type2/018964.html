&gt; &gt;newer vehicles.
&gt; 
&gt; Alternators because of the way they work put out more power (twice as
&gt; much?) than generators for a given sized unit.  So a 50 amp generator will
&gt; be much larger and heavier than a 50 amp alternator.

Chad:
I'd add a bit more- generators have commutators and brushes, alternators
have slip rings and brushes. Since the commutator breaks contact with
the brush many times every revolution, it wears out the brushes rather
quickly.Alternator brushes, on the other hand, last about as long as the
rest of the parts in the alternator- maybe 100,000 miles or more.
