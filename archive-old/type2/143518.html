Subject: 82 Westy Vacation update

Just a quick note to say thank you to all of you in the group who assisted  
me in getting my new '82 Westy road worthy for our camping trip to Big Sur and  
the Redwoods.  We drove 1150 effortless, trouble free miles (ok we blew a  
headlight) up 101 and the wild Highway 1 and only used a half a quart of Mobil  
1  15W 50.  I ran the tires at 40 front 42 rear and got 17 mpg fully  loaded 
with automatic tranny.  
Chuck
