Ok, leave it up to me to start and continue controversy. I guess I must b=
e good at it. I had mentioned before that I received a degree in Automoti=
ve technologies. In school my instructors, who also happen to be ASE cert=
ified, and have masters degrees in Auto, and race funny cars, explained l=
ike this;  When you are building an engine, a race engine, if the car is =
going to run on gas, you build it one way. Now take a look at the interna=
ls of an alcohol burning engine. The rods are much beefier, pistons are s=
tronger, heads are modified, and the crank is or should definitely be for=
ged, and not cast. Can we agree that ether is more volatile than gas? Can=
 we agree that the octane is much higher?  Just look at engines made to r=
un on fuels like this. They are race engines. VWs by design were not spec=
ifically designed to run on this kind of fuel. Moderation? That's relativ=
e, propane in a plastic spud gun? Craaaaazy!  I guess I may value my body=
 parts more than most! If you feel like using ether in your gas engine fe=
el free, but if I am going to pay someone $1600 for a new long block, I t=
hink I will stick to what Jim Budreau, ASE certified, master technician, =
and builder, and racer of funny cars told me. I figure someone who has a =
masters degree in this area, and builds race engines should be the one I =
trust. To each his own, and good luck!  Maybee you could design an ether =
injection system on your bus and have you a funny bus. I think I will kee=
p mine serious!                  Peace!
