&gt; If the buzzer operates when the key is in but not 
&gt; turned then sure you could wire a relay right into 
&gt; there.
&gt; Good idea.

AFAIK, the lead to get the radio to be in powered mode
or not just needs a hint of electricity.  If you have
a stereo with two power leads, one for hot (typically
red), and one for switched (typically yellow), the
yellow would go to buzzer, red should go to alternator
positive with an in-line fuse.  The buzzer would be
the perfect way to go.  

That is a great idea!  I think I'm going to go try
this on my 73 Bug!
