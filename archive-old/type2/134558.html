Subject: VW Bus in &quot;5th Gear&quot; Show

Hey guys,

    Don't know if this is really old news or not... but I was watching Speed
TV. I have the British show &quot;5th Gear&quot; TiVo'ed every time it comes on. They
had a special episode called &quot;The World's Best Cars&quot;. One of the cars that
they picked was the VW Bus. They showed the 1st gen and 2nd gen Buses, and
showed a couple Vanagons. They also showed the new MicroBus which they said
are planning to release in a year or so.

The introduction was funny because they said basically, &quot;The steering is
rubbish, the acceleration is bloody aweful, and the brakes are the least
trustworthy thing on the planet. Sounds to me like one of the world's most
perfect cars.&quot;

They talked about the Busse's shortcomings, but then went on to say that it's
so popular because of it's style and personality that most cars today simply
don't have. They interviewed a BUNCH of VW Bus people and they all unanimously
said that they like their bus because of Freedom and the personality of the
car.


Just thought I'd share in case anyone hasn't heard this yet...


Todd
