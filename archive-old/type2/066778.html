&gt;&gt;&gt;I have a '77 westy that is white, actually it is an off white.  
&gt;&gt;&gt;Does anyone know what color number this is so I can get some 
&gt;&gt;&gt;touchup paint. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;If it is really a Westy (angled poptop, etc.), then it was not 
&gt;&gt;originally white.  If it has a stove, it was originally Tiaga Green 
&gt;&gt;(also called Sage Green).  If it has no stove it was Chrome Yellow.
&gt;
&gt;I have seen one poptop and two hardtop '77 Deluxe Westfalias that 
&gt;were &quot;real&quot; and had Pearl White original paint.  All had green 
&gt;interiors like the Sage Green ones had.

I have a '77 Westy that is white and beige. The colour codes are behind the passenger seat on mine, take a look and see if they are there on yours. Off the top of my head I can't remember the codes but let me know how you get on and I'll check for you if you like.

I think the codes are a letter followed by two of three digits.

SWEDEN....
For those in Sweden where do you get paint from, apart from the tins at Biltema, or from the 'incredibly' expensive VAG dealer (I thought they were bad in the UK :)

Good luck 
Ian
