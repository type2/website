&gt;&gt;Did any VW Things ever come out with automatic tranmissions like what are

&gt;        No, say I.  My '74 thing is still in the hands of it's original
&gt;owner, ME!(yes, for thouse of you who have met me.  There is a long story in
&gt;this)  I have a auto trend (I think that is the name of the magazine)review
&gt;of the thing and the owners manual and there is no mention of an automatic.
&gt;
&gt;        The thing had a thing spicific transmission.  

What is the difference between the thing transmission and the type 1 gearbox?
