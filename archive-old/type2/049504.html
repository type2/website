It all depends on how bad the snow is.  Depth is less important than the
slippery factor, snow at warmer temperatures, closer to the freezing point,
is actually more dangerous, as it can convert to ice easily, and because its
real slippery on compression (under a tire), as the water comes out.

Good tires?  Such as Michelin LTX 195/75R14 M/S -- and you should be find in
most snowy conditions.  Have the chains, but don't put them on until you
need them.  Why?  2 good reasons.  First, chains don't last forever, they
get beat up with use.  More importantly, they are hard as hell on the tires.
Use them when needed.  Common sense dictates that.

But make sure you have good M/S rated tires with decent tread, at very
least, or winter treads.  Or forget it.

The VW bus is a heavy beast, ove 3,500 lbs, most of that weight in back.
You'll have good traction on your drive wheels.  Problem is the relatively
light front end.  This can result in understeer, or snow-plowing.  If you
try to turn to sharply or at too high a speed, the Van just keeps going
straight.  If this happens, get off the gas, and bring the wheels back
towards straight ahead until they do the job in the turn, then gradually
increase how sharp your turn is.

Having said that, easy on the gas in cornering, or the back end can come
around and pass you.

Do keep the speed down in the snow, but more important -- SMOOTH, SMOOTH,
SMOOTH.

You need to have smooth and gradual transitions in all elements of driving.
&gt;From moving to stopping, from stopped to moving, from straight to turning,
etc.  A real light touch is the most important thing.

High speed is obviously bad news, but you may not need to go &quot;slow&quot;.  Use
common sense, make sure you maintain traction -- and visibility can be a
factor as well.

Try to avoid stopping, by this I mean, if there is obvious reason to stop
ahead, slow down well ahead of the situation, and move at &quot;idle speed&quot;,
waiting to stop until the very last moment.  You may avoid having to stop.
Going from moving to stopped and vice versa gives greatest opportunity to
lose traction -- and to skid.  If you are moving, you will find you start to
slide like a toboggan -- right into whatever is in front of you.  If this
happens going downhill, you can actually begin to accellorate when the tires
lock up, if it happens before full stop.  If you lose traction at a
standstill, you get wheel spin, and you may be stuck.  Time for chains?

Hey guys!

It is getting closer and closer to road trip time, and I want to make sure
all of my bases are covered! I am a little nervous because this will be the
first big trip in our new bus, and I am certainly not going to know when the
timing is off and how I would go about fixing it (although I do have lots of
books!) My boyfriend knows more than me, and so far the bus has been
performing beautifully! We went on a little camping trip to the redwoods
without anything going wrong! I am going to have to get used to sleeping in
dark, quite, peaceful places, sleeping in the camper is a definitely a new
experience for me.

We just installed a VDO oil temp gauge, although being in Utah in winter I
don't think we will have to monitor that very much! We also have a new oil
filter and oil and the rebuilt engine only has 15,000 on it!  In any case, I
wanted to get some advice about driving in the snow. Our mechanic, ya know,
the one who came with the car? Well, he suggested that we use the cable
chains and on all four tires and to go slow. I don't know what else one
could tell me about driving in the snow, but if you think of anything......

Also, if anyone has a good list of things not to be without on a road trip
in the winter...belts, nuts, pumps, etc! The AIRS list! :)

Thanks!
Cara
