Subject: Re: Maaco was why is this so difficult?

Hi!

The problem with the cheap body shops are, they're cheap.  They do minimum 
what is necessary, charge a low price, and c'est la vie!

Earl Schreib (like Maaco) ran a $99 special, they'd paint your car for $99.  
I know, I did this (regretably).  They painted over dents, they painted over 
rust, they even painted over chrome.  And the paint failed in under 3 years.

IF you do your own prep work, from sanding to straightening to masking to 
everything else, it's not a bad deal - you're paying them to put on paint, 
which they do reasonably well.  If you expect them to do anything else, 
forget it... They just can't do it and turn a profit.  All they will do is 
run a sander over the old finish to get the new one to adhere.  Everything 
else taked time and eats into their bottom line...

Oh, and if you want a special finish, like a different brand or non-stock (to 
them) brand or color of paint, it costs more too.

If you're not willing to do your own body work, then take it to a good body 
shop (or 2 or 3 to get the best price) and take it where they will do a good 
job.  Otherwise, you won't be happy with the results.  Ask the chick who 
spent weeks just chrome-cleaning! &lt;grin&gt;

can make you feel joyous, powerful, peaceful, frightened, vulnerable, and 
back out to happy again, perhaps in the same ten miles. It is life 
compressed, its own answer to the question, &quot;Why?&quot;

When you arise in the morning, give thanks for the food and the joy of 
living.  If you see no reason for giving thanks, the fault lies only in 
yourself.  Abuse no one and nothing, for abuse turns the wise ones into fools 
and robs the spirit of it's vision.
