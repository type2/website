Subject: RE: [T2] Junk oil filters

&gt; I have heard, many times on our lists that Fram filters are cr*p, and
&gt; other name brand ones because they are made by the same cheap standards.
&gt; Sure Fram filters are cheap to buy, and easy to find, but I think that's
&gt; part of the problem. We keep buying the cheap ones, so they are
&gt; plentiful, but we have to hunt down the good ones, such as the Bosch, and
&gt; maybe pay a little more.
&gt; We put good oil in our engines because we know what's best for them,
&gt; &gt;maintenance-wise, but does it make sense to skimp on the filter?


&gt; Sorry to pop your balloon, but the Bosch oil filters are designed to
&gt; compete with the crap market and are crap. Get the Mahle filters, or
&gt; genuine VW, which are made by Mahle.



In the U.S., the Bosch filter is not an OE oil filter, but simply an
aftermarket American made filter that Bosch repackages and puts their name
on. (In some other parts of the world, they do package an OE filter under
the Bosch name, so this statement only applies to Bosch in the U.S.)

As Doktor Tim alluded to, you should use a correct OE (original equipment)
filter. This means either Mahle, Knecht (another name that Mahle uses; same
product), Mann (another OE supplier to VW), or genuine VW.  None other.

This is a case where you can plan in advance and get the good filters cheap.
I sell the correct OE filters for just $3.99 if you buy 4 or more. (Add to
the order to put it over $50, and the additional 5% listmember discount
kicks in.)  Most people order parts for their bus 2 or 3 times a year (or
more!).  Just remember to add a few oil filters (and perhaps a tune up kit,
air filter, and fuel filter, or other maintenance &quot;staples&quot;) to each order
you place for bus parts, and you'll always have a premium quality oil filter
handy when you need one.  Even if you don't do your own oil change, it pays
to bring the correct filter to the shop that will be doing it for you, as
there's no telling what they might put on your bus otherwise. For four
bucks, it's cheap insurance.

My part number is 021 115 351A.
