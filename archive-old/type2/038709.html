Subject: '69 brake pressure switch problems

I replaced my master cylinder (ouch), now I am having problems getting the
brake pressure switch wires back together.  

I have 3 wires in a bundle coming down from the dash.  One red/black and two
black.  My Bentley shows a red/black, black and a green.  How do I determine
which black wire is which?  All three had been cut and butt connected
loosely enough that they fell out during mc removal.

Thanks
