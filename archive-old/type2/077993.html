Subject: Leaking through bolt for oil pickup tube (type IV) - solution!

I offer this problem-advice-solution message in case it may help someone
else in the future.  Thanks to Jake for the advice!
  --Robert (Ottawa, Ont. 1973 VW Camper)

My original advice request:
- When I was putting my Type IV engine together, the securing bolt for the
oil pickup did not seem to tighten properly, as if it was partially
stripped. I figured I could get away with it (didn't feel like taking the
case halves apart to re-tap - probably a mistake) and finished re-assembly.
The engine is now in my bus, and since adding oil to it, a significant leak
has developed at that bolt. I have tried tightening it but it still leaks. I
have not run the engine yet (it turns but won't start, and I have to
diagnose that). Other than taking the engine down and completely
disassembling to fix the threads, is there anything I can do to minimize or
eliminate the leak, with the engine in place? 

Advice from Jake Raby:
- I would suggest a complete teardown, you can patch the symptom, but you
cannot repair the source with the engine together. 
- There is a HIGH possibility that your engine has the &quot;Syndrome&quot; and has a
small crack in the case web, which holds the threads for the bolt in
question. In this case you can send it to RIMCO, for repair, or we do it as
well. 
- If you continue to drive it as is, and that bolt moves enough to slide out
1/2&quot; the oil pickup tube will drop, and the sump plate wil lose torque,
resulting in all the oil pouring out of the case immediately. This is an
extreme case, but I have seen it.
- You can try to patch it up, but in the back of your mind you will always
know it is the weak part of the engine. You may be able to try a 5/16 STD
bolt, with a 20 thread pitch, it may tighten up, or it may crack the case
even more!

The solution:
- I drained the oil, and removed the horizontal bolt.  It was very badly
stripped, and bent.  I figured I would try to replace the stripped metric
bolt with an SAE one, as a last-ditch effort before taking the engine out
and apart. I tried a coarse thread 5/16&quot; bolt and it just wouldn't catch.  I
then tried a fine thread bolt and it wouldn't catch either (a bit of a
challenge trying to torque down on it from under the bus, horizontally!).  I
even tried fitting a tap in the hole, to get it started, but it was
impossible to work it in that recess position, and the tap was likely not
long enough.  I then took a file and tapered the end of the fine thread
5/16&quot; bolt, to give it a better chance to start in the hole.  I applied a
die to it to make the threads nice and sharp, and went back to try to get it
to self-tap in the case.  After a few attempts, it started to catch.  I kept
turning the socket wrench and finally, it bottomed out and I was able to
torque it down securely!!  I removed it, applied Loctite 242 to the bolt
threads, put a copper washer on the bolt (which was in the engine gasket set
but I hadn't used for some reason, probably didn't realize it was meant for
that bolt!), backed by a 5/16&quot; galvanized washer, and applied Permatex 3H
sealant liberally to both washers.  Then I put it back in and retorqued it
with the 3/8&quot; socket handle, to securely snug.  The moment of truth was when
I refilled with oil (and putting the sump cover on of course).  It did not
leak!  It has been there for a week and not a drop of oil has come out.
(HUGE sigh of relief...)
