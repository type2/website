I guess you didn't like the helicoil/stepped stud recommendations.  Sounds 
like you are looking for a band-aid fix that will take five minutes, won't 
get your hands greasy and will last forever.  I can't help you there but I 
will say this - if you're planning on driving your bus outside of towing 
range, I suggest you rethink your repair strategy.

&gt;Someone suggested to JB weld the stud in.  That makes
&gt;it a permanent fixture, but does that really matter?
&gt;Thank you for the help.  I usually look through the
&gt;archives on stuff like this, but they are still down.

&gt; &gt; you can either get a helicoil
&gt; &gt; kit for it or tap
&gt; &gt; oversize (9 or 10mm, I always do 10mm) and use a
&gt; &gt; stepped stud.  Finding the
&gt; &gt; stepped studs can be difficult but they are out
&gt; &gt; there.
