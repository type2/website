Subject: you have a dangerous gas leak

&gt;From: &quot;Kevin H. Roberts&quot; &lt;bopsax_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt;
&gt;Subject: Heater Controls
&gt;
&gt;I've had my bus for a few years, most of that time sitting in my yard with
&gt;a bad fuel pump or something else that leads to procrastination.  Since I
&gt;got it I had a problem with gasoline odors in the cabin.  I looked around
&gt;for solutions like sealing the engine compartment, sealing spaces around
&gt;the cabin (in the back mostly), etc, but again procrastinated and just
&gt;lived with it.
&gt;
&gt;My bus has none of the original heater stuff except the levers and maybe
&gt;the ducts.  Fans, heat exchangers, etc, are gone.  When I got it, the
&gt;heater control levers were in the up position.  I just assumed they were
&gt;supposed to stay there so I never even bothered to play with them.  I know
&gt;I'll sound like an idiot, but one day I was driving along, smelled gas,
&gt;pulled the levers down, and WALLA!!, no gas smell.  I felt really stupid,
&gt;but now my bus smells good.  


ggm replies:

You should never ever smell gas in your bus. If you smell gas, you have a
dangerous gasoline leak. You are just super lucky you have not been burned
to death so far. I am sure you need to replace every connection going to
your gasoline tank and all the fuel lines on the engine.

I have put a bunch of pictures of burned up busses on a web site. I will
send you the pictures. You need to correct this problem because it is not
just you who could be hurt, but the other people when you get in a wreck
because you loose control of the burning bus.

Please go to the web site and look at the pictures. I have also included a
picture of the hose connections going to a 1978 Fuel injection bus gasoline
tank.

Please look at the pictures here:
