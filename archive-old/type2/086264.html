Subject: RE: [T2] Living in a Bus

I lived in a bus for a while right downtown on a friends lot. It was great.
Look for a gym membership at a community type gym. I found mine for $30 a
month. Then i rented a small storage space the size of a large closet as a
nearby self storage. I could keep more valuable items in here. $20 a month
for that. Total rent: $50. It was an instant conversation as i worked at a
somewhat preppy clothing store at the time and no one could believe it.
Morning routine consisted of walk to the storage space to get clean clothes
and drop off dirty laundry. Walk to the gym to take a shower(I never worked
out there once) place the clean clothes on and the dirty ones in my back
pack to be dropped off tomorrow and went to work showered, clean shaven and
in clean preppy clothes. The police would always ask the nearby hookers if
they knew who lived in the van but they would never say anything and i never
got bothered.

I say go for it!! it was the cheapest rent ever and it forced you to find
fun things to do rather than blob and watch T.V. i met someone new nearly
everyday. I even had a girlfriend live in the van with me for 3 weeks.

best of luck,
