I need to replace the mud flap on my 82 Westy. So I have been looking at
various locations for parts. I found, what looks like, VW O.E. set of four
Mud Flaps from Just Kampers in England.


On page 43 of their latest catalog shows a picture of these set of four O.E.
mud flaps. My question is...has anyone purchased a set of these? If so, what
is your opinon on them--both the mud flaps and Just Kampers? The mud flaps
are black with the rear set having the VW emblem on them.

TIA
