&gt; type2 Digest 5 Dec 2003 13:00:00 -0000 Issue 3137
&gt; Which brings me finally to my question. I've noticed that whenever I've
&gt; parked a car (like in my garage for an extended period of time, a year or
&gt; two), or I've seen a car that's been sitting for a while, the tires begin
&gt; to crack and dry out. These tires that came on this 97 GT are fairly
&gt; expensive tires, about $130 dollars for a single tire. How can I store
&gt; them, so that they won't dry out or crack? I'd likely be keeping them in
&gt; my garage, or at the very least, a shed.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Todd
