Subject: RE: Bosch Alternator Report
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I purchased a Bosch kit when I built my 1600 DP last winter.  The Alternator
is great but...   The Tiawan piece of s*it stand was terrible.  After
messing with it for an entire week trying to get the tin to fit properly I
called a VW junkie in Sacramento and found a VW stand for $20.  The German
stand fit perfectly and ended my frustration.  One side note:  I am running
Hellas for eyballs and with the lights on the voltage on the VDO voltmeter
drops to 12.5 volts from about  14V.   Relax...   it is not the alternator.
The Alternator voltage as measured at the alternator with the Fluke is close
to 14V.  I will be running a larger lead to the dash in the near future to
clean up that  little voltage drop problem.
