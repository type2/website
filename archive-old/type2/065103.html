Happy Fryday, volks!

Why not celebrate by taking the long way home in your bus
this afternoon? (That's what I'm a-gonna do)

In Re to the weekly statz, I notice that there are 5 Tennesseeans
lurking about...Where are the other 4 of you?  My collection of
bus-owning friends and wannabussers occasionally like to do stuff
in this area.  We have connections all over (Dyersburg, Memphis,
Knoxville, South Fulton, Maryville,  Sevierville, etc.)

Add yourself to our list of connections!
