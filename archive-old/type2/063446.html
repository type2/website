Subject: CCC's chain/snow advisory, et al

John Hugenard tells me it snowed just recently at 7,000 feet in
the Sierras.  Some of us will be going over the 10,000 foot Tioga
pass (Yosemite) and he suggested we all carry chains - just in
case.  These could be chains, cables, spikers - whatever you have,
but given the elevation and near change of season, it would seem
advisable to carry something.

Also, remember the following.  This group is getting HUGE.  PLEASE
bring lots of food to share.  Mexican is the theme.  We'll also
desparately need:  firewood, ice, booze, and lawn chairs.  The
weather could be warm or cool, so I suggest layered clothing.

Some of us will be leaving from the bay area Thursday evening
at dinner time.  Please e-mail me if you want to join in thi
caravan.  Others are departing Friday morning, so you may have
a second option if you wish to avoid travelling alone.

See you all there this weekend.  It promises to be a wonderful
location and a stupendous amount of campers turning out!  :)
