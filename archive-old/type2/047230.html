Subject: [T2] 34mm exh. valves instead of 33?? &amp; another valve question

Bussers,

I am trying to find (locally) replacement Exh. valves for my son's '74 1.8 L 
dual carb heads. The old valves measure 33 mm (minus a tad). The only valves 
I've found here are 34mm. The store, a Bug parts specialist, says that 34 mm 
are preferred, even with a 33 mm seat.

My concern is in having the extra metal in the head to pick up heat, 
especially metal that isn't backed by seat metal. Maybe the little bit extra 
isn't significant, but I would like to check it with the experts before I buy 
them (at 1.5X Bus Depot's price :-)

I have read the notices saying ALWAYS replace the exhaust valves when the 
heads are off, but I do wonder if it makes any sense to replace them if there 
isn't much wear in the guides and the valve hasn't stratched. I must admit 
that the history of the engine these heads came from is entirely unknown.

I'm not looking at this question from the money savings point of view, but 
from the hassle and the extra time. We could likely have it running this 
weekend if I was able to inspect the valves and heads and put it all right 
back together. This engine goes in only until we can get the 2.0 L FI engine 
built up...less than a year in any case :-) Nevertheless, I don't want her to 
drop a valve before we get the 2.0 in.

Please reply directly, as I am on T-2 Digest (delayed), but I would like to 
get the valves tonight if they are usable.

Cheers/Don Carron
