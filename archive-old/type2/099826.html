&gt;My question--is it common for rain to enter the rear air intakes (1974)? 

Yes.  And when it's wet outside and the air is dense with moisture it's not uncommon for a dew to settle inside the engine compartment.

&gt;Seems like it would cause a few problems, having one's battery floating 
&gt;around in a pool of water.

So that's what the mounting bracket it for. ;-)

&gt; Maybe I should leave the drain hole unplugged?

The list concensus when the topic came up previously was that the plugs prevent drainage so take them out.
