Subject: 74 exhaust on a 79?
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Hey folks,
   79 Westy in need of exhaust.  Everything gone behind heat exchangers. 79, 
is of course, a 79 only exhaust system. But I see in the Bus Depot catalog 
that a 74 system will work, but w/ no converter. 
     Here in Northern Wisconsin, we have no smog checks, no inspections, etc. 
So the missing converter thing is irrelevant.  (Sorry if you are an 
environmental activist or something)
    I'm wondering- has anyone bolted 74 exhaust on their 79? Can a layman 
like me with ordinary hand tools bolt 74 exhaust right on? Without a torch or 
a welder?
   Thanks in advance,
   Brian
