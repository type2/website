Hey, I think it looks pretty good.

If there are mechanical questions, rent a U-haul pickup and a flatbed
trailer and tow it home. It may be money well spent in rental costs, like
your health. It is better to sort out mechanical issues in your garage
instead of beside the freeway, especially in winter. Brrrr.

Pretty good price, even if it is in so-so shape. All those parts are
replaceable and rebuildable. There is HUGE aftermarket support for those
splitties, even bigger than bays.

I'd buy it, but I like them breadloafs...

I say buy it and have fun! Just be alert and on your guard.

Jon Stiles
