I have a 75 camper van with 1800fi that has started to blowblue smoke in
a peculular way. Nobody in Montana can seem to figure it out, thought i
would try it here. Startup is normal but within two to three miles the
blue cloud will appear. It will continue as long as I keep driving but
the odd part of the problem is that if I pull over and turn the engine
off for 20-30 second the smoke will not reapear when I start it back up.
At this point I can drive as long as I want without it smoking untill
the engine cools off again. About a year ago it was rebuilt by a
reputable mechanic and there has been no problem. I suspect it has
something to do with parking it al winter in Montana and never starting
it. it still runs fine, has normal power and started about three weeks
after i first started it up this spring. Any ideas? thanks Ed
