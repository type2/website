Subject: [T2] NC:  70 Kombi Bench Seat/Pullout Bed

I have a bench seat that came out of a 1970 Kombi that needs a new home.  It
is dark orange and pulls out into a bed.  The seat is located in Cary, NC.
If you're interested in the seat, let me know through email me at
sallad_at_email.unc_dot_edu.
Thanks,
Dallas
