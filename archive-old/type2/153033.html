Subject: Re: [T2] oil change gone bad

Actually it's &lt;insert appropriate eff word of your choice&gt; local auto 
parts store. Could be 'friendly... Could be a different eff word. 
Depends on the situation. My local NAPA has been my FRIENDLY local auto 
parts store for years.  Last Saturday I went in to find new &quot;help.&quot; I'd 
use a different eff word to describe the place now.  New &quot;help&quot; won't 
last....
