Subject: need '79 sliding door interior handle

Hi all:

I'm missing the interior handle for the sliding door on my '79 bus. More
accurately, I'm missing about one third or so of my handle (the remaining
two thirds was in pieces on the floor when I bought the bus).

Anyway, if someone has a spare handle I'd happily be willing to purchase it.

Thanks.

Rob Mead
