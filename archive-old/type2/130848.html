Subject: Re: [T2] FI Update... Pretty near done now.

Hi Volks,

I didn't *really* want to announce anything until I was completely
finished, but since this thread refuses to die I might as well 'fess
up.

This afternoon I swapped the throttle body, AFM, ECU and wiring harness
from our 77 Sunroof Automatic over to the westfakia. It now starts and
runs with a somewhat lumpy idle.

The cause of the high fuel pressure is definitely a vacuum leak, as I
have confirmed that the rubber gaskets between the plenum and the
intake runners are sucking air. When I spray quickstart anywhere near
them the engine RPMs climb immediately. Yes, I do know ether is
flammable and I did this with an extinguisher close at hand. When the
engine is revved enough to get the vacuum up to 15&quot; or better the fuel
pressure does drop back to 28PSI. At idle the vacuum surges between 6
and 10 inches, which is nowhere near enough, and the fuel pressure is
closer to 36-38 PSI.

Once I have the vacuum leak tamed I will be able to set the timing
properly and the engine should smooth out.

I had resisted turning the sunroof into a parts bus, but I can't keep
the westfakia off the road forever. Since I have enough known-good
parts to build a megasquirt system, this is probably what I will do for
the sunroof bus. Megasquirt FI will allow me to ditch a 25-year-old
wiring harness, AFM, ECU, Cold start and Aux Air valve. Once it's
proven to work on the sunroof (ie, at least a full season)  I will see
about putting one on the westfakia as well.

More info will be forthcoming as I get more work done. I'm planning on
going camping this weekend so I hope to be done soon.

Happy trails,

&gt;&gt; Thanks.

&gt;&gt; Basically what it comes down to is, what if all your hamsters are
&gt;&gt; running
&gt;&gt; through the fuel ring through the regulator and back to the tee.
&gt;
&gt; I should have used Pigs instead,, then when the pigs get wings,,
&gt; hahaha!
&gt;
&gt; Sorry,,  &lt;regaining composure&gt;
&gt;
&gt; To get back to trying to help Greg,,  It was worried that he has an
&gt; over pressure problem because his T is too small, &lt;is that getting too
&gt; personal?&gt;  LOL
