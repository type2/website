Hi Travis, and everyone else too,
  The hot start problem certainly is a common one.  To avoid it I took to a 
yearly maintenance routine for the starter.  Now, once a year I deal with 
the starter when and where I decide to.  You know, at home in the driveway 
on a warm dry day.
   I completely disassemble it and clean, inspect and repair it as required. 
  I lubricte all the mechanical parts at reassembly.  Also at the same time 
I clean all of the wire connections for the starter and solenoid as well as 
the posts on the starter/solenoid.  Since you have to disconnect the battery 
to do this safely, I remove the battery, clean it(posts as well as the 
outside of the battery case) and service the water as needed.  This is an 
opportune time to clean the terminals on the battery wires and the chassis 
to engine/transmission ground strap.
   Since I've started doing this I've never had the dreaded hot start 
problem.  It may be the answer to your problem, or it might not.
