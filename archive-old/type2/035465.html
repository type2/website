Also don't forget that 1973 and older vehicles are exempt from
emissions tsting. Starting in 2004, any vehicle thirty years old
or older will be exempt. Keep those buses and bugs on the raod!
Roland Finston's '75 Westy will be exempt in 2005.

The news from California is positive about getting our $300 out-of-state
vehicle penalty fee refunded! The governor is backing the legislation
necessary to pay for the refund, and one committee in the legislature passed
thru the bill last week, unanimously. So don't despair. File for a refund,
if you haven't done so before.
As for emissions testing here, the business is decentralized so that local
service stations are the backbone of the system, via a formal authorization
and on-line computer link to the state. The system is efficient with little
hassle in the procedure; the &quot;standards&quot; are sometimes obscure, depending on
the make and year of vehicle.
The charges for a test run between $20 and $40, plus $8.25 for the paperwork
(now computerwork) for the certificate of compliance. There is competition
in price for the service, and most shops are helpful in letting you tweak
the adjustments if necessary.
All in all not such a hassle, as you describe in New Jersey.
