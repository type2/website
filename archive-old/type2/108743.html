&gt;  I have first, third and fourth (for the moment).
&gt;
&gt;  Where should I start? Front or back? This sounds like linkage to me and
&gt; not transmission, unless someone has other ideas.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for the input, It's raining and I don't want to go under there...
&gt; it's dark and wet. *grin*

    Had the same problem with mine. Sometimes it just would not go into
second. I'd start with the easiest without having to crawl under yet and
adjust the stop plate under the shifter. With the engine off, shift into
second and then loosen the two bolts that hold the shifter and stop plate to
the floor just enough that you can move it front to back. Position the stick
so that the lower portion below the bend is 90 degrees to the floor. Then
with the tranny still in second move the plate and shift assembly front to
back in the second gear gate to find the middle of the travel and hold it
there. You should be able to kind of feel some resistance before it pushes
into nuetral. Last with a screw driver push the stop plate all the way to
the left/ drivers side and tighten the two bolts back down. Take her for a
spin to see if you get second gear back and it still engages reverse
correctly.

Second thing I would check is the front bushing in the hanger right under
the shifter and then the rear coupler at the nose cone on the tranny. Whole
job only took me about half an hour to do.


Good Luck
