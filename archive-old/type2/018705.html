&gt; The Mothership is a stock two litre with FI.  She has traveled around

&gt; FI system.  No it wasn't a connector rattling loose.  It was the AFM and
&gt; jack Stafford and I salvaged one from a yard in LA.

&gt; You guys that are nay-sayers to fuel injection just don't want to take the
&gt; time to learn about it.  I am no expert at anything on my bus but I take
&gt; care of the biggest portion of the work myself and have done so with much
&gt; success.  I believe the key is to keep the system clean and tuned.
Charlie:
I'd have to disagree about the clean and tuned part. I've never been one
to spend a lot of time on this sort of foolishness and I've still had
very few problems with FI. Well, changed a few fuel filters, but that's
about it. 
About the only failures I've had are one failed cold start injector and
one Temp Sensor I (the one inside the AFM). The Temp Sensor I failure
caused an incredible amount of grief, wrecking 4 motors before I located
the problem. This is why I often rant about doing a full load mixture
check. 
One thing though, living in Iowa, and having some sense of where my
bread's buttered (John Deere), I've always used ethanol enhanced fuel.
Changed a leaky gas tank on my old Chevy truck a few months ago, it
looked brand new inside. I feel the ethanol is a lot better at keeping
the varnish in suspension. I like the increased octane, too, as some of
my motors have been on the high side of compression ratio.
