&gt; &gt;Have you been using German mufflers, or the cheaper

&gt; I always use (and recommend) Leistritz mufflers.
&gt; I have been in this game to long to use anything else.
&gt; (I have been driving Type 2's for over 25 years.)

Joe, Ron:
I'd second, er third that. Many years ago I got a chance to get a couple of
Brazil type 2 mufflers: in addition to fitting poorly, they didn't even last
one season here in rust-heaven (northern midwest US).  Subsequent Leistritz'
would last 3 or 4 years!
Stainless would be nice, though.
