Subject: Re: [T2] Volkswagen REgistration Number 

Ah, 1980.  That changes just about everything except the dash location.  Check the frame rail, right side, towrd the front of the sliding door.  I checked the vanagon_dot_com site for this since I couldn't remember if that was where I saw it on my '87 Syncro.

Hope this helps!

&gt; HI All 
&gt; 
&gt; I just got back to my email. Thanks for all the suggestions. I forgot to 
&gt; give my year, I have a 1980 manual trans air cooled Westfalia. I've written 
&gt; down all the suggestions and am going to check them out. The Highway Patrol 
&gt; called today to see me tommorrow so if none of these locations work for my 
&gt; year, I guess Ill have the answer tomorrow. And yes, I think DMV is getting 
&gt; a bit ridiculous, especially since the van was originally from California 
&gt; and the Smog Technician told me I was still in the state database. 
&gt; 
&gt; Oh well , thanks for all the help. 
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers, 
&gt; Janyce
