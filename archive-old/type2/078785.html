Subject: Re: [T2] FI vs carbs, and the 231K mu bus broke down (for 20 min)= boot woes!

Why make a gas tank that will last longer than the car? 
Heck make it out of plastic so It'll crack at the end of six to seven
years like the plastic bumpers, dash panels and the really great high
quality wheel covers that are resting at every railroad crossing.
Galvanized gas tanks last almost forever.
I've had tanks off of an 83 Cadillac, 59 Chevy truck and when I looked
down into them while replacing the fuel gage senders or pumps they were
clean as a whistle with zero rust.
The fuel pump for the Cadillac was $58.00, made by AC Delco, it mounted
in the tank.

&gt; &gt; Comment on the fuel pump being inside the tank- yes it's common 
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; modern cars; we paid $400 to have it replaced in a Nissan 
&gt; Quest/aka
&gt; &gt; Mercury Villager, because of the labor involved.  Another downside 
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; how do you keep rust and other tank contaminants from affecting  
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; pump?  You can't change a filter in the tank!
&gt; 
&gt; This is very true, and is one of the reasons they've been using 
&gt; plastic fuel
&gt; tanks in new cars for quite a while. No rust!
