&gt;
&gt; Hello.  I have just joined the list.  My SO and I bought a beautiful 1971
&gt; VW Bus (Westfalia).  I got it home, and immediately changed the oil and
&gt; adjusted the valves.  I ran into troubles with the battery not charging,
&gt; which I traced down to what I thought was the regulator.  I replaced it,
&gt; and was out for a test drive, when I suddenly smelled smoke.  I saw smoke
&gt; pouring out the back, immediately shut it down and pulled over to the side
&gt; of the road.  When I opened the back, I saw that the belt was broken.
&gt; After replacing the belt, I started the engine, and heard a loud
&gt; &quot;pop-pop-pop&quot; sound out the exhaust.  My question is: is this a fried
&gt; exhaust valve?  What are the chances that further damage was done?  How
&gt; much should I expect to spend?  The engine has the old oil cooler in the
&gt; fan housing, so I assume it is #3.  I have the car into the VW shop now.
&gt;
&gt; Bummer, huh?  I hope it isn't too bad.  I was surprised at how quickly it
&gt; went.  BTW: the gen light wasn't working, so I didn't see when the belt
&gt; broke.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for any help, pointers, or sympathy.
&gt;
&gt; - Glen
