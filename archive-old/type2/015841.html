No, you want as much torque as possible so the bus won't move.  First gear
is best.  If you're on any kind of incline at all, use the parking brake.
Better to have to unstick the shoes than to have to have your bus pulled
out of a ditch.

&gt;&gt;don't set the parking brake unless you need it.  Just leave it in
&gt;&gt;1st gear on a flat and only set it if you're on an incline.
