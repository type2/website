	[Crick, Bill [KAN:0W40-M:EXCH]]  Someone sed: 
&gt; As to the &quot;American Way&quot; with no gauges, we &quot;Americans&quot; as usual got lazy
&gt; and Detroit knows that and it costs Detroit money to install the real
&gt; thing!! Then I ask you, why in recent years has dear old Detroit put back
&gt; the &quot;gauges.&quot;  Because the general public who really care about their
&gt; equipment really want to know what the oil pressure is, what the water
&gt; temp
&gt; is, and if the battery is charging.
&gt; 
	[Crick, Bill [KAN:0W40-M:EXCH]]  
	I don't think it is that they want to know what's going on.

	I suspect the _vast majority_ of them don't even understand what the
gauges mean!

	I think the reason they are putting more gauges in is once again -
&quot;the baby boomers&quot;.
	They are all having their mid life crisiis, and shedding their old
stuffy minivan 
	for a &quot;I'm not old, I drive a _Luxury _*Sports*_ Sedan_&quot; car. Of
course if its  a Sports car
	everyone knows sports cars have lots of gauges. And its an expensive
luxury 
	car which of course has to come with &quot;lots of stuff&quot;, or maybe even 
	&quot;all stuff that is possible to show its reallty expensive.
	So: we need  &quot;lots of stuff&quot; to show how rich we are, and
	we need &quot;gauges&quot; to show how sporty and young we still are.
	 The obvious marketting solution - LOTS OF GAUGES - QED.

	76 Type I/IV/VII - among other things including a &quot;Luxury Sports
Sedan&quot; which I drive in the 
					 winter to save my van from
rusting;-) 
	 
	NOTE: Luxury Sports Sedan seems a bit like an oxymoron to me.
