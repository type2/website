Subject: Side windows.

A while back someone asked about replacing the center side windows with a
solid piece of glass and doing away with the vent window.
Today I found a 76 with no center vent windows. Both windows are one-piece
factory VW-marked glass. If anyone wants them....I removed them. Shipping
from Fresno, Calif. may be a little tough.....
West Coast Metric supplies the seals for these windows. Part
#241-321A-L/R..... their price of $24.50 each is about what I paid for each
glass.
