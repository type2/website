No there was no sticker on it. The part was stamped vw audi.  I do trust the bus
depot, but, i guess it is possible it could be a dansk part. the part number is
021 256 092M.   It did fit after some manipulation.

&gt; I too was surprised to learn that the &quot;new-old-stock&quot; replacement exhaust
&gt; heat exchanger for your VW Type 2, caused fitting problems!
&gt;
&gt; How can you be sure that it was a genuine VW replacement part? Did it have
&gt; the VW or VW-Audi sticker with Genuine Replacement Parts or Ersatz Teile
&gt; script, attached to it. What was the part number?
