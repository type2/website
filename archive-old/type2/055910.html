&gt; Does anyone have a feel for how accurate the Bentley is re: wiring
&gt; diagrams? The chart that shows which fuses protect which circuits bears
&gt; almost no relation to the reality of my fuse box.  
&gt; mailable) part of your choice from my 71 Deluxe, provided I've still got
&gt; it.
 
Bob,

I just replaced the fuse block in my 70 camper and can certainly feel 
your pain.  I took two days of potsing around with the attitude that 
I had a late model wiring diagram and an early model diagram and how 
hard can it be anyway.  It should be an easy task to interpolate 
between the two right?  WRONG.  I finally had the Bentley manual air 
shipped in and can tell you that the job is impossible to do without 
it.  After getting the manual it took me about 4 hours to complete 
the task.  THERE IS JUST NO WAY YOU CAN DO IT WITHOUT THE BENTLEY.

It seems that your wiring may have been 
'tinkered with' by well meaning previous owners in the past.  Here is 
what I did.  I am not recommending you do this unless you have a 
substantial supply of beer and cuss words on hand for instant use an 
just can't fix the problem any other way..

Get a 20foot wire and put a shielded aligator clip on one end and a 
probe on the other.  This is a jumper wire to test continuity with.  
Get a multimeter with an audible continuity alarm. (cheap from Radio 
Shack).  Get the Bently and open to the appropriate page.

Remove the ground strap from the battery.

Remove the Fuse Block

remove the wires from the back of the block

Drink beer real fast and say 'What have I done?!?!'  Cuss words 
optional at this point.

TRICKY PART (pay attention)  The Bently appears to show the fuse 
block in reverse or as if you are viewing it (with x-ray vision) from 
the front of the bus looking aft.  If you can keep the perspective 
right then all will go well.  I drew a picture of the fuse block on a 
piece of paper to keep things straight and it is now a part of the 
permanent records.  I labled it 1 thru 12, left to right.  This 
appears to match the clear plastic cover that goes over the block.  I 
then labeled the Bently fuse block diagram in the reverse....12 thur 
1 left to right.

(use cuss words now.)

Then, using the jumper wire and the continuity meter, start with 
number 12 (which is left on Bentley diagram and right on the drawing 
and as you are viewing it from the drivers seat) You should also 
lable the block drawing 'top' and 'bottom'.  

Fuse number 12 has a wire from the top that goes to the rear cabin 
switch.  Find which wire goes there and put it in place.  I had to go 
the the rear cabin switch and remove the cover, take the wire loose 
and 'buzz' test it with the continuity tester until I found the right 
one.  Put it on the top position on the back side of fuse number 12.  
I also at this point put a piece of masking tape on the wire with 12T 
to tell me where it goes.

The bottom of fuse 12 is jumped with fuse 11.  Fuse 11 Bottom has a 
wire that goes to number 30 on your light switch.  Install and 
mark it and move on.

It was helpfull to me to draw pictures of the relays and switches and 
lable the tabs with the numbers so I could refer to them. It takes 
a little longer to do it this way but the numbers are hard to wee 
when installed.

The top of fuse 11 has three wires on it.  One goes to the ignition 
buzzer, one goes to the overhead light, and one goes to the number 30 
terminal of the emergency flasher switch.

By now you get the picture.  Go slow, be methodical, be patient,and 
it will work.  It is a lot like eating an elephant...take it one bite 
(wire/circuit) at a time.  You will eventually get real tired of 
eating elephant but that sucker will disappear.

I am proud to say that EVERY circuit in my bus now works as 
advertised for the first time since I bought it.  That is except for 
the key buzzer.  It is hooked up but the buzzer is bad and I am not 
about to replace it.

Let me know how it works out.  Where are you located?  If it is in 
the neighborhood I might be able to stop by for an afternoon and 
help.  I live in Wilmington, North Carolina.

George
