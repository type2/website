&gt; How far can a valve stretch I wonder? I think John's right, but it was
&gt; a question that popped into my head while reading the message.
&gt;
&gt; I was thinking a valve couldn't stretch more than a 10th of an inch
&gt; before snapping.

Probably true, but .100 inch is a lot of .006 valve tightenings!
Remember, after the valve stretchs to the point where the valve gap is
zero, there is no force left to stretch the valve.  It'll burn the valve
and seat, but it won't stretch any more!
