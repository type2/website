&gt; Dual single barrels need a balance tube to even out the impulses because 
&gt; the adjacent cylinders fire consecutively. In other words, firing order
&gt; (as you carbs see it) is: 2,1,4,3. So what the right carb sees is:
&gt; 2,1,_,_,2,1,_,_, and so on. The left carb sees similar pulses. So what
&gt; happens is that  2 gets a lot richer mix than 1 and 4 gets a richer mix
&gt; than 3.

--&gt;  I've never understood this explanation.  I don't have my engine bay
handy to look in (I'm on a 3-week vacation) but as I recall the
cylinder layout is thus:

        1  2
   Left      Right
        3  4

So wouldn't the right carb see 2,_,4,_,2,_,4,_, etc.?

Thanks for the advice on cleaning the carbs...I'll probably try that when
I get home. :)

&gt; The next thing to consider is timing and distributor selection.
&gt; What are you using for a distributor, do you have the vac advance hooked
&gt; up, and to where?

--&gt;  Currently, the stock distributor (1977 engine), vacuum/centrifical
advance.  The advance is hooked to the vac port on the right carb.  (The
left carb's vac port is plugged, of course.)
