Subject: Help!  For anyone with Hankook tires on a Vanagon/Bubble Bus

Hi all,

I'm trying to decide on the purchase from the Bus Depot of a set of Hankook
RA-08 195 series (not the 185's) tires for my '87 Vanagon Westy.  Perhaps -
OKAY! - I'm definitely getting anal about this.  I'm hoping that the outer
tire diameter of the 195 series Hankook's is a bit bigger/taller than the
Michelin MXL 205/70R14&quot; tires currently on my Carat alloys.

Is there anyone out there that has a new to fairly new set of mounted/inflated
Hankook RA-08 195 series 14&quot; tires on their Type 2???  If so, I'm hoping that
you might quickly jack the tire off the ground and run a tape measure tightly
around the outer diameter of the tire in the center of the tread width and
then e-mail me the exact measurement (example: 81 1/4 inches around, etc.)
Yeah, I know, I know...

I'll be doing the same on my older Michelins later today and I want to compare
the numbers to see if the 195 series Hankooks might be larger in diameter than
my older 205 series Michelins.  Right now, in my auto trans Westy I'm doing
about 3,900 rpms at an &quot;indicated&quot; 70 mph, and I'm looking for a tire that'll
get me a little more top end for the same rpms.  I already asked at the Bus
Depot and they didn't have any tires there that were mounted and properly
inflated - let's say for comparison purposes at 32 psi.

Anyway, thanks in advance to anyone out here that can help out in this tire
size comparison.  If there is interest, I'll post any results that I recieve
afterward.
