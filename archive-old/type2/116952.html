Subject: Longsleeve SYF Tees

Hi Volks,

I recently ran into the guy who did the Steal Your Face and Crying Bus
shirts for me this past summer.  He said he would be willing to do a run of
the Steal Your Face shirts on grey longsleeves for me if I ordered 24 pcs or
more.  Unfortunately the Crying Bus screen has a rip in it, so he can't run
them right now.
They are available in adult size LG, XL &amp; 2XL.  The LG &amp; XL will be $15.00ea
plus $4.00 shipping via Priority Mail.  The 2XL will be $17.00ea plus $4.00
shipping.  There is a picture of the shirt here:
http://www.geocities_dot_com/vwcamper72/longsleeve.html.  I prefer paypal, but
can take a money order or check (will wait for check to clear before
shipping).  Let me know if you would be interested and I will put in the
order.  He said he will run the shirts early next week, so I will ship them
all out on Nov. 3rd unless I get them earlier.

Cool Runnings,
Jay Brown
