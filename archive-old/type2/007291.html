Subject: Yikes! a crack!

Hi list,
While changing the push rod tube seals on the 2.0l engine I'm planning on
putting in my '72 westy, I noticed a crack in the head on the valve cover
sealing surface.  Not ever hearing of such a crack I cleaned the area up
real well and discovered what looked like an area in the recess where the
pushrod tube goes, that appears as if the push rod got wedged in there and
continually was forced against the head, causing a divot in the aluminum, a
flattened out spot on the push rod, and the resulting 3/8 inch long crack
from the divot to the valve cover gasket surface.  Bummer. This eng. was
slated to go in tomorrow.  Could a hyd. lifter have failed and caused this?
 do I need to check anything else?  Do I need to get this this welded or
can I goop it up with some kind of &quot;sealer&quot; and be ok? Any advice or
opinion would be valued greatly.  Thanks list!
Mark
