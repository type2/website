Subject: best splittie camper

howdy volks,

searched the archives to no avail., so i thought i'd fire off my 1st
question to the list.

is there consensus as to which was the best pre '67 camper?  (more
specifically - westy vs. sundial) or is it 6 of one and 1/2 a dozen of the
other......

also, if all other things are about equal between the westy and the
sundial, do parts appear to be more plentiful for one than the other??????
anybody know which was the most produced model?

TIA!
