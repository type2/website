Subject: Re: [T2] Locking engine hatch, el-cheapo

You'd probably want to put the button in the back somewhere :)

I could just see that:

push the button, run to the back.. DOH!

. . . walk to the front, push the button, run to the back, DOH!

. . . . . . .walk to the front, push the button, run to the back, DOH!

kinda like a dog chasin' it's tail, huh?

hehehehe
Mike

p.s. yes, I know you could use a non-momentary switch.. it was just kinda funny..
LOL

&gt; If you want a real cheap engine hatch lock,, use a fence gate latch hardware,
&gt; you pick what you like the best, as a couple versions will work, I like the
&gt; sliding pin one
&gt;
&gt; Mount it vertically on the hatch door, fasten a cable to it, drill a small hole
&gt; in the tin, so you can run the cable into the cargo portion, just inside the
&gt; rear hatch door,
&gt;
&gt; when you close the door, it will latch, and you have to open the rear hatch to
&gt; pull the cable to release the hatch door
&gt;
&gt; If you want to get really elaborate,, search the pick and pulls for an electric
&gt; trunk release, and mount it the same way,, then wire a switch on the dash to
&gt; release the latch
