tObi,

The truck that you would be looking for would be an 85
Ranger.  Give the salvage yard that info, and they
will get you one.  I paid $10 for mine and it worked
wonderfully.

The F150's had the same one.

Hope this helps,

Mark

&gt; 
&gt; I remember seeing a post concerning using bosch
&gt; pumps for Ford pickups in
&gt; fuel injected buses
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have anything to add to this, I do
&gt; recall that it was 85-88 Ford
&gt; trucks....
&gt; 
&gt; Part numbers, warnings, advice.....
&gt; 
&gt; thanks,
