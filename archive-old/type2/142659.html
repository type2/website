Subject: Find Of a Lifetime!!--78 Westy,42,000 original miles!

I know I have posted this to several unrelated list's--but this Type 2
Bus someone may be interested in ( not me I'm all full with &quot;neat stuff)

I get a phone call from a crazy buddy of mine, and he tells me a guy who
is executor of an old ecentric womans estate is trying to sell some
unusual items.

She had 30 some motorcycles.( she raced enduro's, and ice raced ) as
well as a 60 mini cooper, 59  Jag XKE and some other wild 4 wheeled
rides--

OK here's the punch line---and a 78 Type 2 Westfalia with only 42,000 on
it--original.

All the vehicles have been stored in a heated, concrete floor garage /
shop / shed whatever, and are no more than dust covered.

If anyone has an interest in the Westy let me know--I'm going up to pick
up the Mini Cooper,the Rickmann Triumph's, Zudap's, and Bultaco's she
had.

Offer's are being accepted from the executor of the estate.

Maybe I can get some picture's of the Bus if anyone may be interested. 

Take Care,

            ______________
