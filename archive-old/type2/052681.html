Subject: [T2] I need VW web assistance!

Hello Bus friends!

I have been surfing the web looking for help with what I am about to ask but 
have been unable to find anything.  I was wondering if anyone out there is 
either a web design student, knows one, or has some connections. I need to 
update my VW web site but neither have the time nor the skills to upgrade the 
site the way I want it. My site is very high profile so whoever helps me with 
this would get a lot of exposure. Unfortunately, I can't afford to pay for 
services. My site is not for profit. However, the individual who helps me is 
more than welcome to post about themselves and their services through out the 
site.  If anyone can offer help I would appreciate it. Please contact me _at_ 
vwdude1957_at_aol_dot_com for more info.
Thanks in advance.

Dave
