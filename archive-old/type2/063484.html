Subject: Re: Oil Temp. Sender Question

&gt;  Purists will cringe, but I mounted my gauge on the top of the dashboard 
&gt;with a single piece of duct-tape.  This performs two vital functions: it 
&gt;holds the gauge down securely without drilling any holes in the dash, and 
&gt;it looks so good and ugly and *cheap* it will hopefully discourage anyone 
&gt;from breaking into the camper to steal stuff.

&lt;Cringe&gt;  VDO makes some attractive hard plastic above dash housings that
fully enclose the gauge.  I bought my 3 gauge housing for $12 (Busboys,
RMMW, etc. sells them).  I plan on mounting it on the dash with velcro tape
slightly to the right of the steering wheel (housing pots are angled to the
left) and routing the sending wires through some of the speaker holes in the
middle of the dash (which the housing slightly covers).  

I probably could've bought 5 rolls of duct tape for the price I paid for the
housing, but I like to save all my duct tape for structural repairs ;).
