Subject: Late bay Westfalia box info needed

Hi folks...

Does anyone out there know the exact dimensions of the Westfalia box 
that sits between the front seats in the late bay Westies?  I know 
they're rare...

I'm planning on having a &quot;reproduction&quot; made by a local cabinet shop, 
with an upgrade... cup holders in the front, and possibly a little 
pocket or other mounting spot with power and audio connections for an 
iPod.

Since I'd like it to be as close to the original as possible (ignoring 
the additional length due to the presence of cup holders and modern 
electronics :-), it would also be useful to know if it was hinged at 
the back or at the front, and also what material the straps that held 
it to the seat pedestals was made from.

Thanks!
