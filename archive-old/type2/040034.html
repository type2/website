Content-Disposition: inline

&gt;I'd
&gt;suggest you get under there and change the oil and filter yourself
&gt;post-haste. I'm still too intimidated to tackle that strainer thang.
&gt;Gotta get a tiny torque wrench (that's how I think of it).
&gt;I just had a parts counter guy tell me today, &quot;The Fram oil filter is
&gt;just fine for VWs.&quot; Uh-huh, that's not what I heard....


warm up bus. turn it off. remove filter and pull out new one. Mann is best,
but a motorcraft isn't going to seize your motor while you're waiting to buy a
german one. Fill the filter with new oil and coat the gasket with oil to help
seal. intall hand tight then about half a turn more. check instructions on
filter.
loosen drain plug with 17mm, loosen sump plug with 13mm
pan underneath, drop sump plate and drain plugs. drain oil. fish out two
nuts, screen and sump plate. wipe clean then wash in hot soapy water. dry.
new gasket kit. intall new copper crush gasket with drain plug, install cleaned
screen with new gasket kit. Tighten drain plug til tight, then, finally, tight
tight.
Tighten sump plug with socket wrench until the tendon pops on your wrist (see
Muir book for &quot;Stick's&quot; method if still nervous) about 9 foot pounds. Put in two
quarts of oil (I use Castrol HD30 in Summer and Castrol 10W40 in winter -
northeast US)
wait. Check level. Add the last 1/2 quart a little at a time if needed, checking
the
level each time. stay between the lines. test ride. park. check street under
motor for your blood. have a good road.
