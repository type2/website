Subject: clickety-clickety-clickety steering noise

Lately the steering in my 78 has been making a funny noise. It kind of 
makes a clickety-clickety-clickety noise. I can feel it in the steering 
wheel. This happens while I'm turning the steering wheel. It happens 
mainly if I am moving the bus around to park it, but it does not make 
the noise when I am driving. Also, it is intermittent. Sometimes it 
makes the noise. Other times I can move the bus around and there is no 
noise at all.

Any thoughts? Thanks.

Rob Mead
