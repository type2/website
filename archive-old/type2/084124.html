Believe it or not it is actually in the pile of xtra parts I got from 
the PO (of couse I thought it was some kind of army surplus thing he was 
unloading on me ) Can  I convert this &quot;cot&quot; into an actual bed that a 
human could use? Have you ever seen this done? As it is it doesn't look 
very comfortable. From all the other posts it looks like I'll have to 
stick with what I have so I need to figure out how to accomodate one 
more person without the side tent option.
Thanks
Kev

&gt;That top did originally have a one-person cot that unfolds from the open
&gt;pop-top.  I'm sure yours is missing.
&gt;
&gt;The later top &quot;74-'79 hinges at the rear and has the fold out full bed in
&gt;the top.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;List,
&gt;&gt;I have a 79 with a poptop installed by PO. The poptop is hinged in the
&gt;&gt;front and the luggage storage piece(w/the slats) is in the rear of the
&gt;&gt;bus. This doesn't seem to match any of the 79 poptops. I have seen. I
&gt;&gt; need to replace both the seal and the canvas so I need to know what I
&gt;&gt;have here??
&gt;&gt; I would also love to know if I could find the correct top as this one
&gt;&gt;has no provisions for an upper bed . Thanks all
&gt;&gt;
