Hey George,
You're the physics guy so I have a question.  The sump plate is steel, all
else is aluminum.  Could it be that the sump plate isn't conducting the
heat as well?  It just came into my mind and that's no place for physics
stuff.:)  You could buy one of the Kymco billet aluminum plates to test.
I'm hoping to head west in a week or so.  I'll be checking my
oil temps (besides the Berg stick) using my old fashioned Fluke
thermometer very carefully.  Assuming I get my oil cooler hooked up.
I can only really get a reading down the
dipstick tube but it seems pretty realistic.
