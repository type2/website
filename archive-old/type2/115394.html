Subject: RE: [T2] Key Blanks 

Mike,

the basic 'R'  key blank is readily available.

What is difficult to find is the one with the 'inverted VW' on it.  But even 
this one can be found for about $10 each.


Check this site for a good look at the different types of keys.

    http://www.mark1vws_dot_com/   go to his   KEYS section

I have used this VW shop to re-key my ignition, and I am happy with Mark's 
professionalism.  He can be found at many VW shows near his local area
