I suggest this was true of the 70's multi-weights. It is not true of 
current spec oils. This was proved by Porsche in their &quot;100 hour&quot; testing 
which was going on continuously as new SAE specs came into play every few 
years. Up to about 85 or so, they would not approve multi-weights for 
break-in oil. But then they did approve it after the testing proved off the 
shelf SAE spec multi-weights had the guts for the most extreme conditions, 
and they accepted multi-weights in proper weights for all uses, and no 
longer inferior for any purpose than single weight, and certainly superior 
for extending operation to much wider ambient temps.

If current correct chart multi-weight oil is turning thin on you, either 
you have gas dilution from defect elsewhere or too long a change interval. 
The multi-weight oil is not the problem, and single weight will not fix or 
improve anything.
