&gt; There's some discussion of windage trays in the archives. Wilson
&gt; mentions this part, and every Type 4 case has a little rack molded into

&gt; was feeling deprived.
&gt; 
&gt; But note: the windage tray bolts up to the oil pickup. In both of the
&gt; oil pickups in my possession, there is a blank where the bolt would go.
&gt; But it's a blank. These never had windage trays. Some DPO/rebuilded
&gt; didn't throw it away or leave it out. It was never there in the first
&gt; place.

Some other minutae:

The oil pickup tube for an engine with a windage tray installed is a
different part. As you noticed, the round bit at the end is the same
stamping, hence the blank where the screw would go. Type 411/412 and 914
have a windage tray, but not Bus. You cannot install a windage tray in an
engine case that did not originally have one because of the way the pickup
fits into the case, and you need the correct pickup tube, which is a
different length than in Bus (non-windage).
