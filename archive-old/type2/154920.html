Subject: Re: [T2] DIY heated seats

http://www.checkcorp_dot_com/seat-heater/seat-heater.asp

scored a passenger 
&gt; seat from a '75 (for *my* '75) that has fresh upholstery and seat heater 
&gt; elements installed. &gt; 

Looking at the tags on the wiring the heating elements are from Check 
&gt; Corporation, which I haven't bothered to google yet...
