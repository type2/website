Subject: Distributor Overhaul

Hi List!
After reading Bob Hoover and a few other articles and manuals, I figgered I 
ought to overhaul my dizzy. It's pretty filthy inside and I found the fiber 
washer in two pieces on the bottom of the housing. Well, what I'm wondering 
is if that fiber washer goes in the same place on my diz as the 010 in pic 
#8(down) . My Diz has the Bosch # 0231 170 093 - VW # 022 905 205 S. 
Although it's not exactly the same, Glen Ring's 010 overhaul site is a 
useful loose guide. But I wonder if anyone knows where an expoded view of my 
diz can be found online?
