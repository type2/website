Subject: Re: [T2] Steering column to floor part??

Thanks for all the info on the mystery part. Consensus seem to be that the
collar is not for the late Bay steering column. When I replaced the
coupling, steering box and drag link, I thought it was strange that there
wasn't any bushing to help center the steering column inside the tube. It
went together ok because of the little step on the floor mounted cover
plate. This had been bothering me for a while. Thanks.
