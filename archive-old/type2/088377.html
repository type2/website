My nine-year-old daughter is begging me to take her.  I'll probably make =
the trip IF we can get at least one other bus to caravan with us from =
Indiana(located halfway between Indy and Louisville and willing to meet =
somewhere!).  She has been to the event a couple of times, but was too =
young to remember it...We haven't been since '96.
If anyone would volunteer to follow us 'in the slow lane' ;) please =
pmail!
J. Schmidt
