Subject: oil breather question
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello list,

I have a little question. I couldn't find an answer in
my Bently 
manual. What purpose does an oil breather have? Also,
I took the cover 
off 
mine and noticed that it was full of old dried flaking
oil. Will this 
hurt? should I clean it out or will this do more harm
than good? Where 
does the hose that is connected to it go?

I would appreciate any advice that any one can give. I
have been 
studying my Bently manual recently. It really helps! I
also want to say 
that 
I really appreciat all the helpt that this list has
given me. One day I 
hope I can return the favor. Until then, I am working
on getting a bus 
on the road. Thanks everyone!

David Kelly
