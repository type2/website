Subject: Re Jalousie windows

A good alternative to the jalousie windows are the sliding windows. When I was restoring my 1973 Bus, I had a bunch of those large solid windows, with the little flip out windows. Unfortunately, most of the frames on those flip out windows were damaged. The replacements for these were $150 a piece and I needed at least two of them, maybe 3 if I wanted it to look good. I looked for alternatives and even considered just replacing them with solid windows.  I ended up going with a set of sliding windows for my side door, and the apposing wall.

The sliding windows, when open, give me almost 50% flow through the entire window area. They're clear (unlike most jalousie windows) and they absolutely give the Bus more of that open air feel to it. I was never really happy with the flip open 1/4 windows since they were really small... kind of made it feel even more enclosed than a school bus! With these sliding windows, it almost has that Jeep feeling to the interior.  

The sliding windows came off a 1979 I believe.

I got them for $75 each ($150 for the set) from Busted Bus.


I did end up keeping one flip open window, which is located on the rear quarter window (not on the side with the sliding door). It totally makes the inside of the Bus feel much more open and roomy with the sliding windows.

I've never taken my Bus camping, but before I started re-doing the wiring, my wife and I would take it to Fort Lauderdale beach quite often. And with these sliding windows, it totally makes it just that much more fun.

&gt;Glenn,
&gt;
&gt;How well does the AC work in your van? Here in Atlanta, the jalousie windows 
&gt;keep our van bearable without AC, even in the summer. Friends who do not have 
&gt;jalousie windows have told me their van got very hot. You might want to 
&gt;reconsider.
