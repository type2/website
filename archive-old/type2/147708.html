Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator light on.

&lt;&lt;i got a new well rebuilt&gt;&gt;&gt;

New or rebuilt?
Who rebuilt it?
You watch them do it?

Unless you've done it yourself, replaced all the windings and
commutator, there's no such thing as a well rebuilt alternator.

I've replaced waaay too many of them &quot;Well Rebuits.&quot;


 &lt;&lt; and mine still does that sooooooo? does that mean mine is fixing to
go out again.&gt;&gt;

No it's not fixin' to , it be.

If you have the headamps , radio, whatever on , and the alternator light
is on, the &quot;Well Rebuilt&quot;, is not puttin' the correct amount of amps
out, or your belt is slippin' real bad.

I responded to the alternator being bad, or on the way out assuming that
all concerned are on top of the PM on their Vehicles too.

If not, I aplogize.
