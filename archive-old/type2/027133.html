I have a 75 westy with an automatic transmission.  I am in the process of 
rebuilding the engine now and it seems everything is broke.  When I first 
bought it I brought it down to get looked over and the mechanic called me 
saying the gear box was filled with red transmission fluid, it was leaking 
oil at a rate of 1 quart per 100 miles from seemingly everywhere, etc.  It 
was obvious that this bus was not properly taken care of.  The mechanic told 
me he didn't know what to say about this bus (in other words there is 
probably a lot more wrong with it and I shouldn't drive it until I could get 
these things fixed).  I was still determined to fix it up.    Well he 
replaced the fluid with the proper oil and I drove it only another couple 
hundred miles before i started the rebuild.  When I pulled the engine I 
found that the cast iron casing that the engine is mounted to on the torque 
converter has a large chunck broke off (enough that one of the bolts does 
not have anything to connect to).  Anyway, I have a lot of decisions to make 
and I am going to need some advice.  I want to get it running well and so I 
am going to take the time to get the engine into top shape, but I am worried 
about the drive train.  What am I all going to need to replace other then 
the engine?
