Keep in mind that Haynes manuals come from England.  There were no
carbureted Vanagons sold in the USA.  USA buses came with
carburetors until 1975, when Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection was
introduced.  As for non-USA VWs, who knows.  Those Europeans took
a while to adopt fuel injection, because they didn't have stringent air
quality laws like we do.

I just opened my brand new Haynes manual ($13 BTW) and the first 
picture I found is of a carburated Vanagon.  I have a '80 and the  book
covers the air cooled Vanagons.  So they were available on a  Vanagon.
 Never seen one though, but then again I live in California.

&gt; I think he's asking until which year was a westfalia offered with a
&gt; carburated engine.
