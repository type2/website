Subject: Re: [T2] 72 Disc vs 73 up?????

&gt; What's so different from the 72 Front disc brakes, and rear brakes also, that

Two years, '71-'72.  The pads were made thicker in '73 due to rapid pad
wear.  The later calipers don't brake any better, they just require fewer
pad changes.

  Are at least the Spindles on a 72, and rear
&gt; hub, the same as the 73 and up Bus?

Nope, everything between the ball joints and wheel is different.  I've
tried mixing and matching, but no-go.

  I want disc on the front of my Split and
&gt; found a deal on a 72 Bus, $100.  Don't want to use the 72 disc, but if the
&gt; spindles are the same I'm going to buy it for the beam and rear hubs.  I have
&gt; IRS on the back and someone is making me shock towers to use the 72 beam in
&gt; the Split.

Nothing wrong with the earlier disks.  IIRC, you can do some swapping with
early bay beams and later spindles to get disk brakes without modifying
the bus for the later beam.
