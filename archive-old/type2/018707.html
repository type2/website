Subject: Hot Start Relay blowing fuses?? 
Message-ID: &lt;377D3AA6.307D_at_ibm_dot_net&gt;

Hey all,

1) I installed the Hot start relay kit into my 76 camper (FI 2L, 4sp) It
has been working great until this weekend.  We drove for 2-3 hours,
stopped &amp; then tried to start the bus.  Nothing - checked the relay and
the fuse had blown.  Replaced it, drove all weekend in SW Va mountains
(see below) and it started great.  Driving back home ~3hrs, stopped,
went to start it and a blown fuse again.  Both times the engine oil temp
was 220-230 for a while.  Today it was &gt;90 ambient past 8pm.  So, 'm
thinking that the relay helps, but when the starter gets too hot (23yo
starter) the solenoid/starter is too bound and requires SO much current
that it will instead blow the fuse - make sense?  Is this correct - do I
need a new starter?
