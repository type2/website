&gt;Jumped in my bus yesterday, cranked her up and went to back up.  She

&gt;up, ran through all the gears no problem.  (clutch is only 3k old and I
&gt;had driver her the previous day).  So, I just revved her up and dropped
&gt;the clutch.  A brief metal on metal sound and I was in motion.  I'm
&gt;pretty certain that it wasn't the clutch/pressure plate combination.  It
&gt;felt as if my wheels were locked.  Has anyone experienced this problem.
&gt;Do I have a potentially larger problem.  Any and all suggestions
&gt;accepted and gladly considered.

Sounds like your rear drums were stuck.  It's happened to me more than once
and I usually fix it just the way you did.  It seems to occur when you set
the parking brake after driving in the rain.  So now, I don't set the
parking brake after I've been driving in the rain.  :)
