&gt;Their idea of fixing it involved slathering BLACK urethane sealant all over
my pretty &gt;new seal and the body. I looks like sh!t and I am pissed.

&gt;I've been there myself.  If you want it fixed right, you will need a new
&gt;seal.  What they did was glue your seal and window in place.

Steve et al,

Here is what has happened up to this point: NOTHING.

I was having a hard time getting the local Safelite shop to return calls and
show up for appointments. Since Safelite is a national company, I called
&quot;the home office&quot; to let them know that I was having a some problems that
were not being addressed locally. The H.O. folks were nice enough and placed
a call the local shop about the situation.

They are supposed to come out today and have a look.

BTW, it is currently raining and the window is leaking :(

Thinking I shoulda done it myself
