Subject: Murder and A. I. R. S.
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

Just my 2 cents:

This was a horrible thing to happen, nothing will
change that. But there are evil people around and from
time to time they pop up and things like this happen.
But it seems to me that having a system like A. I. R.
S. is a way to maybe make the world a little bit
safer. Who knows, perhaps already it has saved
someone. And in the years to come with luck it will
help more people out.

A. I. R. S. is a good idea. Maybe in a small way what
has happened can make it better.
