Subject: RE: [T2] Altitude adjustments?

Don writes, and Wes replies:

Don &gt; &gt; What, exactly, do I need to do to my 73 with dual PDSITs on Sunday
when I start hitting 5000+ feet of altitude?
Wes &gt; You need to adjust mixture to run a little richer.

Not quite right: the mixture needs to be leaner, not richer!  The air is
thinner at altitude, so the mixture needs less fuel, not more.

Of course, it's *very* important to re-enrich the mixture as you descend to
lower altitudes.  Forgetting to do this is a common mistake that pilots make,
as virtually all piston-engine airplanes still have manual mixture controls in
the cockpit...
