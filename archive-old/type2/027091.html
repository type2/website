Subject: Re: [T2] Valve Adjustment question!

So I completely disregard the paint marks on the pulley? At any rate, thanks 
for the quick response.

&gt;Hey Will,
&gt;There should be a mark on your distributor that is pointing back and
&gt;slightly to the right out of the hatch of your engine compartment door
&gt;.. at about this angle
&gt;
&gt;|front of car|
&gt;|            |
&gt;|            |
&gt;|  dizzy     |
&gt;|      \     |
&gt;|            |
&gt;|back of car |
&gt;
&gt;see that diagonal line underneath dizzy, that's about the angle that the
&gt;little line on the rim of the distrubutor should be pointing.  Spin your
&gt;alternator bolt until the rotor lines up with it and then you have TDC.
&gt;Then go ahead and adjust cylinder one.  Then spin the engine so the
&gt;rotor turns counter-clockwise 90 degrees from that position, and you
&gt;have cylinder two, then three, then four.  Piece-o-cake :)
&gt;
&gt;To remove the valve covers, a drum brake tool works WONDERS!
&gt;
&gt;remove the spark plugs and it makes it easier to spin the engine, and
&gt;it's a good time to install new ones if you want...
&gt;
&gt;later,
&gt;Mike

&gt; &gt; Hello:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am fairly new to the VW world and am attempting my first valve 
&gt;adjustment
&gt; &gt; this weekend with the help of &quot;How to Keep Your VW Alive.&quot; However, I am
&gt; &gt; confused about one point in the process - TDC.  To get #1 to firing
&gt; &gt; position, do I simply line up the paint mark with the crankcase crack - 
&gt;and
&gt; &gt; that's it? The book mentions a file mark on the distributor rim, which 
&gt;mine
&gt; &gt; does not have. Also, do I use the paint mark on the left or the right (I
&gt; &gt; have three). I appreciate any help. Thanks.
