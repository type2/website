Subject: Re: Door Handles on 73 Westy

Hi Volks,

I took the drivers and passenger side door handles off my 73 westy to lube
them, now they won't open from the inside unless you pull *all* the way
back.

What have I done wrong? I'd prefer to know what to look for before I pry the
door-panels off again.

Thanks in advance,
