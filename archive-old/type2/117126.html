Subject: Re: Junk / Parts

i know at ecology in so cal they keep the busses in the impound section
untill they can get time to pull the tranny and engines to sell seperatly.
i think if you could get in good with the yard they would hook you up but
save that, you won't see a bus tranny in a so cal yard.
