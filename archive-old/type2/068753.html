Mine makes a huge difference when it's on.  Especially at idle - I actually
get enough air out to keep the cab warm when the engine's idling.  Not true
without the electric fan running.

&gt;Craig,
&gt;I don't think so.  On my old '78 it would run anytime the key was on and
&gt;the right-side red lever was down.

Craig is correct that the engine must be running for the fan to operate.  I
have verified this in the manuals and by watching the fan in my bus.
