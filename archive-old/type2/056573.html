&gt;I want to first clean, sanitize, and
&gt;flush the water tank (as it says to do on the side of the
vehicle) but I am
&gt;not sure how.  Is it possible to remove the tank and do it that
way, or is
&gt;it just a matter of running soap &amp; water thru the tank and out
the drain
&gt;via the hoses and such?  What should I use as a cleaner and
sanitizer?


Watch out for soap flavor staying in plastic, yuck!
I sanitized my tank with sanitizing tabs from work (kitchen).
They use these tabs in the final rinse water at bars and such.
Maybe you could get some from a bar, if you frequent one.
I also remember using them in Boy Scouts, so a camping store may
have them.

Just a thought, it worked for me.
