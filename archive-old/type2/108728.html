Subject: Trade Windows

Hello Everyone,

My two new (old) jalousie windows have arrived. If anyone can tell me how
these install, I would GREATLY appreciate the info. They look tooo easy to
install. What holds them in???

Also, upon installing a driver's side window, do you have to take the door
apart into two sections? Are there any pages on the web showing how to replace
the glass, rubber and guts for the front doors?

I have windows, if someone needs them for a 1970 Westy Bus: Slider door vent
and full, rear driver's side vent and full. Center full on driver's side.

I DESPERATELY NEED a driver's window and a full rear window for the driver's
side. If anyone wants to trade, please let me know. If anyone has them for
sale, can you save them? I overspent on my new bus this month to the point of
insanity!

Update: not bad for my first bus, purchased on June 18th...and no garage to
work in...just a huge 30 x 20 blue tarp for cover from the torential Florida
rain! It looks like there is a blue monster in front of my little townhouse.No
complaining neighbors so far...just lots of rust and old paint to clean up off
the driveway.

Interior: Stripped ALL interior except the dash.
Stripped, sanded, rust treated and primered all interior walls from the driver
compartment back and also the flat raised cargo area and wall behind seat/bed.
First coat of stripper in driver's compartment. Removed all raised roof
paneling, glued paneling tightly, removed all screws and trim in readiness for
canvas coverage. Planned overhead sky with a desert vista all around (fine
artist here). Started removal of front valance today. All five inches around
the entire bus will have to go, but the frame is very clean and sound.

Thanks for your input everyone.
Hope you all had a great Fourth of July.
Stephanie
