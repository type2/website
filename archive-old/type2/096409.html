Subject: Re: [T2] Amazing engine



Wow!  It is clean, but that's what a rebuilt(properly) is supposed to look 
like.

What is interesting to me is the shot of the interior....this bus appears 
to be a Champagne edition, but after blowing up the interior shot, the 
upholstery on the back seats does not appear to have the cloth inserts!

I went out and looked at the original dealer brochure on this site
http://www.72camper_dot_com/champagn.htm

and the inserts appear to be there, but they are not the gray/brown that I 
have.

Can anyone out there with a 78 champagne edition set me straight on this?

Did they just make them different? or what....mine has a 3/78 production 
date.  They say the pic is from 10/97....may be just different production 
date changes?




Cheers, dave
