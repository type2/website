Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Pop Top Fiasco / Etiquitte

My only complaint was with the not being told of the NLA.  Other than 
that i was very happy with the order and the products.

&gt;&gt; Isn't that what this list is for?  Advice?   There is nothing
&gt;&gt; personal against Ron or anyone else.  I am only a customer looking
&gt;&gt; for the best supplier.   If vendor problems are off-limits to this
&gt;&gt; list (as they are on some others I belong to) that needs to be made
&gt;&gt; clear to people joining the list.
&gt; No vendor problems are not out of line. Some of us that have seen the 
&gt; same
&gt; posts come around again for the xx time forget thats its new to many
&gt; of you. Bus Depot is a good vendor. Ive had problems a few times and 
&gt; Ron,
&gt; when personally informed, has always made it right by me. He cares, they
&gt; try, they are cheap and dont try to fool you about the quality.
