&gt; I recommend that you never keep your clutch pressed in for more than 15-30

Add to that the wear on the thrust bearing behind the flywheel.

I wonder if the practice of starting the engine with the clutch depressed
accelerates the wear on the thrust bearing?  Seems like a bad thing to do
to preload a plain bearing with several hundred pounds of load, force what
residual lubricating oil there was from the bearing, and then run the
whole thing at low speed until the oil pressure finally comes up.

Something to think about.
