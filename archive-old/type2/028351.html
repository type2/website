I am pretty new to the bus thing myself too, having just (finally!) gotten
my first VW.  Mine was leaking really bad - PO assumed the main seal - so I
got a real deal.  Anyway, the leak was pretty much right side.  When I
removed the panel down there on the bottom, I found that it was leaking out
of the old fuel pump.  The PO had installed a new electric pump, leaving the
old pump unused. Looks like the diaphragm went out of the unused mechanical
pump finally.

Anyway, you may want to check something like that.  Good luck.
