&gt;Can you send a link to that pic again, and any specs you might have?

That was me - here is the info again:

&gt;Here are some pictures I just snapped:

&gt;It only took a couple of hours and some common tools to build it. Drill, jigsaw, drywall screws, glue gun, and an insert with pushbutton wire hookups. Not the fanciest nor the best, but entirely adequate for my needs. I can remove it from the bus in less than a minute and thieves don't give it a second glance.

If I had it to do over again, I would use a smaller woofer (10&quot; instead of 12&quot;) and probably made it a bit taller and shorter (front to rear).  As another listmember mentioned, a port would probably improve the sound somewhat.
