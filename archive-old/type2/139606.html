Subject: Re: [T2] vac dizzy help on 71 1600 dp...

Daniel,

look for the notch on the inside lip of the dist....is it where the #1 
wire is on the dist cap?

Been a long time since I looked at one of these, but it looks to me like 
the wires are 1 off, or the distributor is timed off...I seem to recall 
that the dist should be turned about another 30 degrees or better in the 
clock wise direction.

Go here and check specs and compare points.  http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/


You never blow on a vacuum port to test it, only suck.  If you do this and 
the vac arm inside doesn't move, then part of the vac unit is shot...or if 
you suck on it and just keep getting air, then the vac unit is shot.

Personally, at this point, I would disconnect the retard side and 
temporarily plug the line from the carb...and then try it....if the retard 
side really is leaking, then you probably have a serious vacuum leak.

What is the total advance?  Does it match the spec on Ron's page above?
How good does the spark look?

Cheers, dave

&gt; Listees,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm in a bind trying to get this vac dizzy to work. It's a 205AH which is 
&gt; supposed to be completely interchanable with the stock 205Q for this engine. 
&gt; German. My bus was running a 009 and I had gotten it to run pretty well with 
&gt; it.
&gt; 
&gt; So the problem is serious lack of power, like it's running on 2 or 3 
&gt; cylinders. I have verified the wires are correct and also verified all the 
&gt; boys are firing. Here's a pic of my set up at one stage of messing with it:

&gt; 
&gt; Since then I have figured out the port in the rear on dizzy is vac and 
&gt; outside is retard. You can only blow in on the inner port. The vac hooked up 
&gt; to the drivers side of the carb and the dizzy doesn't advance AT ALL when 
&gt; you rev her. But hooked up to the other one it does.
&gt; 
&gt; So is the vacuum unit shot? Maybe I'm running the wrong points, they are 
&gt; what I got for my 009 but thought they would be interchanable. Would 
&gt; condensor have anything to do with problems?? I have points gapped at Muirs 
&gt; spec and I&quot;m timing it at 5ATDC at 800RPM.
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions on getting this setup tuned will be helpful, otherwise I'm 
&gt; giving up and putting the evil 009 back in so I can drive and pick up my 
&gt; paycheck later today.
&gt; 
&gt; TIA.
