Subject: [T2] Propane Stove

First of all I would like to offer my heartfelt condolences to the family of
Kristin and any of you who knew her.  That tragic story has diffidently
weighed on my heart this morning and I pray that those responsible are
brought to justice swiftly.

On a technical note, I have a '78 westy that will be filled with propane
today for the first time under my ownership.  What I would like to know from
the list is; how are the controls on the tank and stove operated and what
safety factors should I be aware of.  The stove operation manual was missing
from the bus when I bought it.  The controls look straightforward, open
valve on tank, open burner control valve, light with match....anything else?

Gracias,

Ben Beasley
