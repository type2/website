Subject: splitting Foly's case

I have Folly's old 1700cc engine down to almost the nubbies! &lt;?&gt;

I figure I split the case and see what the inside of a type 4 looks like. 
So, after weeks/months of frittering around I down to the last big 17mm 
bolts that run thgrough the case.  I can't budge 'em.

I brought the case to a local mechanic... he was able to loosen 4 of the 
6 nuts before his socket shattered.  So now I'm going to bring it to a 
REAL engine shop.  I've soaked the nut with penetrating oil but would the 
collective wisdom of the list have any words of advice before I take the 
motor in.  I know to tell them just to loosen the nuts and not to attempt 
to take the bolts out!
