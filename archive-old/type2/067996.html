&gt;I have a type 4 motor that is getting ready to be rebuilt. When it is done
&gt;the displacement will be around 2200cc. 
&gt;
&gt;My question is: has anyone had any experience with Jacob's ignition
&gt;systems and how have the worked, or does any know about them or someone
&gt;else who has used it.

My former boss put one of these on a low compression 1800 in his '74.  At
first, he had a Holley Progressive on it, and it would not run worth diddly.
He installed the Jacobs setup, and had absolutley no problem with stallin
the cold as he did before.  Power was better, both torque and hp, all seat
of the pants.  Later, he smartly reinstalled the FI it came with, and it
improved economy by a lot.  Every person I have heard that has put this
system on an aircooled VW motor has like it, while the watercooled owners
don't seem to notice that much of a difference.  Hope this helps....

And yes, they do have a heavy sales approach.  And they also say that the
Bosch factory ignition is one of the worst on any car.  That can't be so........
