Subject: Re: [T2] '78 Exhaust Removal to swap to new Engine

Hey Mark,
I don't know if you will be able to get all that off in one shot or not. And then of course getting it back on would be another small miracle. I just pulled all that stuff off my engine ('79 style heate exchg. etc...) and I did it in one shot to get it off, but it wasn't easy. It really didn't want to come off that way. I think getting it back on would be the real hard part, but if you could get it off then it wouldn't be so hard to work with either. Mine came off with a little praying prying. Might be able to get yours too!  :)
