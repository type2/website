Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel pressure

Yeah,I was thinking about that today. Im going to try and get to it this
weekend. While looking at it last night it seems that it might be a good
idea to put some sort of elbow in there somewhere. The nipple on the
regulator and the metal tank line arent exactly in line with each other
which looks like it will cause a slight kink even in a hose cut to the right
length. Really wish I hadnt filled my tank this morning!
I can just imagine how you know and I am not sure I want to hear that horror
story!

&gt; Jasan,
&gt;
&gt; I would have fixed that one soonest.  If it kinks and blocks up
&gt; entirely...you will have 150+ psi almost instantly in your fuel ring.
&gt;
&gt; This is *not* a good thing.
&gt;
&gt; Don't ask me how i know&lt;grin&gt;.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, dave
