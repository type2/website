all,

I just felt the need to say to the list that i already had a deal with the
guy who is selling this bus to buy it.  We were figuring out how much of a
deposit i should send and when i replied to the guy this morning he said
he sold it to someone else.

I spoke to the guy for over an hour on the phone long distance, i started
planning on how to get it home.  I mean, this was a done deal. I was out
of town over the weekend and didnt bird dog my e-mail, but since the deal
was done i didnt see any need to.

offer made and accepted.

deposit being arranged.

transportation being arranged.

to anyone selling a bus, when you post a price and accept an offer that is
a legally binding contract.

I have corresponded via p-mail with Issaiah and he has pretty much said i
dont care if you had a deal.  Its near me and i want it so screw you.  

I have even offered a compromise where we could split the price and i get
some of the parts and he gets the bus, he has pretty much said no way.  He
will take what he wants and if anything's left over i can get that from
him later.

I guess if isaiah wants his first bus purchase to be full of bad karma
thats his deal, but im sure his bus ownership will be tainted by its
beginnings.

I'm really not sure what to do about this whole situation, but it really
leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

ticked off,

Steve

&gt; doors...glass...are even off.  all the glass is out, but the trans and
&gt; wheels and brakes and steering etc is still intact.  I just have to
&gt; rewire the whole bit, paint it, and wire it.  Should be fun!  The only
&gt; body flaws are a slight dimple in the rear drivers side belt line...waay
&gt; in back...jsut a little...and a dent in the nose which is easily
&gt; fixable.
