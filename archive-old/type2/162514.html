&gt; I have a 1979 FI bus.  I hope this isn't too much of an idiotic question
&gt; (I've already spent half my lunch hour perusing the archives), but I gotta
&gt; know:  Is there a way to open the small plastic rectangular electrical
&gt; connectors you often see between two connecting wires (that is, the ones
&gt; that hold and connect the metal spades at the ends of the two wires)?  I
&gt; need to replace my cylinder head temperature sensor and last night went out
&gt; to have a look at everything and found this connector where the sensor wire
&gt; connects to (assumably) the wire leading to the FI harness.  The plastic
&gt; connector seemed permanently closed and not meant to ever be opened.  Is
&gt; there a way I can open that thing up?  I don't want to have to remove it and
&gt; then splice the wires if possible.  Thanks for your help!


cutiing and splicing the wires are by far easier, but if you really want
to torture yourself there are two small protrusions or ears that hold
those things together, you need to slide two very thin &quot;things&quot; into
either side of the connector from the wire side until you push in those
ears then the connector will slide out of the plastic.

now I used the techinical term &quot;Things&quot; becaause I have found screwdrivers
will generally not work. in fact I use dental tools to open them when I
absolutely have too.  they are really designed to go together and not come
apart.  (haaving a freindly densit helps too)

good luck
Bob
