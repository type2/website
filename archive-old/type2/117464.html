&gt; Okay, I can't let this one go.

me either
&gt; 
&gt; You say you are mad when you see someone driving alone in a big V8
&gt; SUV?  Let me ask you this - do you ever drive alone in your bus?

I'm almost always alone, but I have cut my annual mileage from about 25k
to about 10k 

&gt; That said, I still drive my bus because, as someone else mentioned, we
&gt; have the freedom to drive what we want here in America (and Canada
&gt; too).

yup,   when I don't drive the bus I'm usually on the train!!!
