Subject: master cylinder replacement and brake bleeding

Hey Marcus --

I second the recommendation on bench bleeding.  What this means:

1) Buy a length of brake line [say 12&quot;-18&quot;] with metric end fittings
suitable for the master cylinder output ports, i.e., the same as your
VW brake tube fittings.  Should be a buck or two at discount parts
store.

2) Cut the new brake line in half.  Clean burrs/chips from the cut
ends.

3) Bend each piece into a broad 'C' shape -- you want the cut end to
be near the bottom of the reservoir and the fitting end in the output
port.  Tighten the fittings.

4) Clamp this assembly on your bench [gently if you use a vise]; fill
with clean/fresh brake fluid.  Then use a dowel to depress the piston.
You will see bubbles of air rising in the reservoir.

5) Press and release repeatedly, until you see no more bubbles in the
reservoir.  At this point your master cylinder is free of trapped air
and ready to install.  Take out the 'C' lines and save them in a clean
plastic bag in your tool cabinet!

Best of luck!
Glenn
