I did the same thing you are talking about last winter for my 1600 except
for the porting and three angled valves.  I went with Berg on the oil pump
as I liked the idea of his cover with the relief valve built in.   I also
did the full flow thing.  I just followed the Sermons and what instructions
that Berg sent and I am very happy with the results.    As I recall  Hoover
recommended  not to go with Berg on the fancy hoses (the inside diameter is
too small I think) .  I went with the cheapo hose bibs and clamps and maybe
will upgrade someday.   My hoses are less than 1 ft each as I bent up some
stainless tubing to make up the difference.

good Luck
