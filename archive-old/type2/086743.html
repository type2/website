Subject: RE: [T2] Engine won't start - ideas?

When turning it over with the starter, it can do it with the plugs in or
out.  When turning it by hand to try to get to TDC, I've done it both ways
too.  The valves seem to move when I turn the motor, though not being able
to turn fully around makes it hard to tell.

	If it's not compression, it's construction.  Perhaps a valve is closed,
physically preventing you from turning the motor over(longshot).  Or perhaps
there's fluid(fuel) in the cylinders?  Using the starter to turn the engine
over, are the plugs removed?  Or are you removing them and then attempting
to turn it over by hand?
