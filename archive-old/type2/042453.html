Subject: mileage

Hi all,

     What would be the best way to find out if a vehicle's mileage was
accurate?  I am going to be looking a a camper that the owner insists has
only 48K.  I have never even seen a bus with less than 100K let alone 48K.
I was thinking of getting a Carfax report.  Any ideas?  Thanks.
