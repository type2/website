&gt; Hey Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; Almost done sorting out my first Westy ('78 2.0L, FI,
&gt; auto). PO had it sitting for 2 years, It now *runs*
&gt; (compression 120,125,100,135) and *drives*.
&gt; 
&gt; I need to get the windshield wipers to work. The
&gt; wipers blow the fuse when I switch them on. Any
&gt; testing tips, or suggestions on where to start whould
&gt; be appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Did what I like to call the &quot;Inspection Dance&quot; this
&gt; weekend. This is when you walk around the van to see
&gt; if all the lights (directional, brake, reverse, etc.)
&gt; work. Fixed the the directionals and hazard lights,
&gt; and I can't seem to figure out whats shorting out the
&gt; wipers.
&gt; 
&gt; TIA

John:
The wiper shaft assemblies could be rusted in place. I've seen this
happen on buses that sat for long periods. Have someone wiggle the arms
through their free play and watch underneath to see if the linkages
move. If the linkages move the shafts are not frozen. I once had a bad
wiper motor in my 78. I sucessfully transplanted one from a 70 in its
place. The intermittant feature from the 78 even still worked. The 70
motor was physically larger (and actually looked like a better motor)
than the 78 but worked just fine. I think I had to solder the wire
harness. P-mail me back if going this route, I parted out the car and
that wiper assembly is around somewhere, I could give a much more
detailed description if anyone cares.
