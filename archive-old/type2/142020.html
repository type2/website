Subject: NO BRAKES!

Chris, you said the caliper was hot when you removed it, but you didn't say 
that you had to do anything to retract the piston (maybe squeezing it back with 
a large C clamp).  In my experience, when a caliper seizes-up, usually it is 
the left front, which gets the worst of US/Canada road salt exposure; usually 
the symptom is that the piston cannot retract.  AYMK, getting the caliper off 
requires retracting the piston so that the pad assembly can be lifted over the 
unworn ridge at the outer edge of the disk.  I didn't hear you describing these 
conditions.  My guess at this point would be that something (moisture, rust, 
cup/Oring detritus) in the brake fluid has caused the master cylinder to 
malfunction, to the extent that the front pistons do not retract sufficiently.

You didn't describe the fluid coming out of the m/cyl or the caliper.  Maybe a 
little more narrative (rather than less) would help at this point.

.....wrestling with rush hour traffic in Knoxville, I put on my 
brakes to slow down and my foot went to the floor.  I'm sure many of 
you know that feeling.  I was able to pump them up to get more brakes, 
but it was still spooky.  I pulled off and just happened to stop at 
Ron's Import Parts (I've bought from him before).  I got out and 
immediately smelled brakes.  I put my hand on the LF wheel and it was 
HOT.  I put my hand on the RF wheel and it was also hot, but not so 
much so.

I decided that the LF caliper was the culprit, heating the brake fluid 
to the boiling point or something like that.  I walked in and asked Ron 
if he had a caliper for my bus.  He said no, but a call to O'Reilly's 
up on the hill (where they do the boogie) garnered what I needed.  When 
I picked it up, I found that it was one of those with only one bleeding 
nipple, but I was in no position to haggle so I took it back down to 
Ron's where he showed me a level place in the shade to work on my car.  
He had to close up shop and go home - it was almost six........
