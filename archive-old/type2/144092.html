Subject: Re: [BSKA] Fellow Bus WOman Needs help in Nebraska

Hey GUYS GALS
I am at witts end. The lady just called back about 10
min after my post last night she was moving her bus
acrost the parking lot and it started on fire.  I am
not shure but I am begining to think that the bus or
someone does not want to leave.  I am going to inform
her that her best bet is to call mom and get a way
home, leave the bus there is no way we can fund a
complete overhaul.
