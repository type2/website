&gt; Sounds like it might possible be timing.  Do you have two vacuum lines

Yes, there's a vacuum advance on the dizzy.  It is ported with two vacuum
lines that have been replaced in the past year and are in good shape, one
from the side of the vacuum diaphram goes to the exhaust manifold and the
one coming from the back of the vacuum diaphram goes to the exhaust port
located on the left side of the carb (34 pict3) near the idle speed and
idle mixture screws.  The vacuum port on the rear (rir) of the carb has a
rubber nipple blocking it off.  The nipple is cracked in not in
particularly good shape, but stops most of the vacuum.  

Are the vacuum lines in the correct place, and would that rotten plug
cause these problems, especially after it was running relatively well
before the tuneup?

&gt; The 5 degrees ATDC is only applicable when you are running the vacuum
&gt; advance distributor.  If you're running the ever-popular 009 (centrifical
&gt; advance) distributor your static timing will need to be more like 7.5 BTDC. 
&gt; Both the vacuum (stock) distributor and the 009 can be set with a timing
&gt; light, and both for around 28 degrees BTCD with the engine at about 3000
&gt; rpms.

I usually only set my timing statically, although I do have a light.
Perhaps I should double check with the light...

&gt; If I remember correctly, the dwell should be around 40/45.  Slightly more

Muir says 50 deg. +/- 2 deg.  I haven't checked Bentley to confirm this
measure.

&gt; Did you re-check your wiring?  And particularly the condensor and points
&gt; connections.  If one of these is off - or loose - engine performance will
&gt; be erratic.

I'll check again.

Thanks,

Tom
