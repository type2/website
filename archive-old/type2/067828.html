&gt; Times.  We may all love VWs but we should never forget it's less than
&gt; innocent beginings.  Sometimes I'm not sure how to reconcile the fact
&gt; that every car I own is a VW with Nazi roots, but if I was in Germany
&gt; 50 years ago I could've been condemned to slave labor and made to work
&gt; to death.

&gt; VWs are great, but there is blood it's hands.

Okay, it is true that Hitler talked to Ferdinand Porsche in late 1933
about designing a car cheap enough to put automobiles within the reach
of everyone who wanted one.  The &quot;Kdf-Wagon&quot; (as Hitler called it) went
on to become the beetle we all know and love.  But the truth is, by
1945, no actual production of Hitler's &quot;People's Car&quot; had taken place
(except for about 600 of so).  At the end of World War II, the British
appointed Major Ivan Hirst to take charge of the Volkswagen factory.

When he arrived, the factory was heavily damaged by air attack.  It was
really Ivan Hirst's incredible efforts that turned the factory and the
company around and got production of the beetle going full swing.

Personally, I give more credit to Ivan than Hitler.  Just my view...
