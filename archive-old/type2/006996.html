Comments: To: Claralw_at_aol_dot_com

I have found as David and Clara have that the WCM grey door
rubber firs well but that it is way stiffer than the OEM
rubber and hence IMHO comprimises the ability of the door to
seal properly. FWIW alot of the WCM rubber (particularly the
top of the cab door &quot;scrapers&quot; to be WAY too stiff and make
opening and shutting the door a real pain in the butt. I
have heard good things about WW but have no direct
experience.

On a realted note I have heard that the WCM rubber for the
cargo area pop out windows to be REALLY stiff so much so
that peeople have actually broken windows attempting to shut
them (push on the outside of the window ina n attempt to
shut it and crack :(   )

&gt; &gt;  Who *does* have correct front door to body seals now
(for early
&gt; &gt;bus)?
&gt;
&gt; The best door to body seals I have seen are the West Coast
Metric
&gt; ones.  The profiles are pretty correct, but the color is
wrong.
&gt; The Wolfsburg West front door to body seals I got a year
or two
&gt; ago were the correct color, but every piece was the same
contour
&gt; as the cargo door rubber.  I'll take the correct contour
over the
&gt; correct color any day.

&gt; Hm, I thought this originally meant the weatherstrip on
top of the door, the
&gt; one that attaches to the window frame, and seals between
the top of the door
&gt; and the frame.   I guess you mean the stuff that is glued
to the frame.   I
&gt; didn't like the repros I saw, the cross section was wrong.
 It was made of
&gt; one kind of rubber foam stuff, while the original was
rubber round the
&gt; outside, foam in the inside, which gives a completely
diffent level of
&gt; squishiness and sealing.   I  forget the brand though.   I
stick with good
&gt; used, haven't seen a decent repro, and would be glad to
hear of one.
&gt; I found a stray window frame top seal in the garage, I'll
put in on Nellie
&gt; drivers door, when I find a frame with a good wing window
latch.  Water
&gt; dribbles in there.
