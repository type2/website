Subject: Re: Gas Heaters According to Kath :-)

I have a gas heater in my 71 camper, I did not know they were unsafe to use
while camping. I have and do not smell any fumes but I guess that is exactly
the point isn't it! I was told that it would be safe! Is this true or should
I only use it while driving? Sorry, I don't know the model.
