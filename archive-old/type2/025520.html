&gt; This may be a very stupid question, but this is only the 2nd time I have
&gt; done a valve adjustment on my own, and I am trying to figure out if I have a
&gt; BIG problem, or something silly I overlooked.
&gt; I retorqued my heads this morning, and proceeded to do a valve
&gt; adjustment. Everything went fine until I tried to do the intake on Cylinder
&gt; 3. I can not get ANY gauge through it, even with the screw backed completely
&gt; out. I turned the engine again to make sure #3 was at fire, still can not
&gt; budge any feeler blade through.
&gt; I have spent the last hour in the archive, but still am not sure if
&gt; there is something else I can try...or am I looking at engine work now?
&gt; This is a real bummer with a local bus campout only a week away...
&gt; Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated!
&gt; Oh yeah, its the '70 I am working on currently. (has 1600 dual port, no
&gt; modifications)

Take the rocker arm off the engine (two nuts) and watch the valve.

If the valve keeps coming toward you when you remove the rocker arm, there's
a possibility you've got a valve seat that's dislodged itself. Only cure for
that is to replace the head.

If this is the case, a head replacement only takes a few hours, depending on
how good you are at dropping engines. Remove engine, remove the stuff from
that side (heat exchanger, manifold end, tin), remove the eight head nuts,
remove the head and look at the valves. If one looks like it's sunk into the
head, put on a new head and put the engine back together and back in.
