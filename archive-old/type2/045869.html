Subject: Re: [T2] battery to choose?

There's yet another alternative...

ATWOOD makes a marine battery tray/hold down setup for Grp. 24 &amp; 27
batteries.  They're inexpensive  -
~$5.00 as I recall.  Consists of a plastic tray that has side extensions to
accept threaded hold down uprights, and they attach at the top to a plastic
fixture that spans the battery's top.  As the whole assembly is plastic
[black] it's totally non-corrosive.  The design requires not tools to
clamp/unclamp a battery.

I don't know if there's room for a plastic battery box to fit inside
[ATTWOOD makes them as well].

I've seen these locally at West Marine, Boater's World, and Schuck's Auto
Parts.

I also carry a plastic battery box on the left side of the engine room, in
the &quot;auxiliary battery&quot; space.  It contains 5 qts. of CASTROL 30W oil, a
small can of brake fluid, and a plastic funnel for adding the oil without
dumping it all over the engine.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Another approach is to make a base plate that is held down by the stock
hold-down bolt.  Attach new hold-downs to this base plate to secure your
battery.  The plastic battery box is a very good idea!  &lt;&lt;
