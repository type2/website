My fuel gauge only ever shows completely full or empty, and this indication
will vary from day to day so is nothing to do with actual fuel levels.  I've
searched the archives for a wiring diagram as I suspect a faulty connection or
short somewhere.  

There were some excellent posts about cutting a hole in the van to access the
fuel sender unit but I'd rather avoid that if i can!!  So if anybody can tell
me where the wiring goes whilst on its way to the dashboard gauge I'd be most
gratefull.
