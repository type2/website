Well I don't want to burn the bus or me up. I have heard of some installing
the heater under the passenger floorboard and am going to look into doing it
that way for now, if there is room for that.
Seems like I would end up doing as much cutting on the floorboard as I would
the firewall and wheel well though.
The decision is a tough one, but I am itching to install the heater. Anybody
else who wants to send me more input or their stories is always welcome,
even if you decide to call me stupid!
I will post pics of it on my website once I do it if anybody is interested.

&gt; Running fuel lines in the passenger compartment is STUPID.
&gt; Installing a gasoline-burning heater in the passenger compartment is
&gt; likewise STUPID.
