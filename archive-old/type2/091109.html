Subject: Re: [T2]Westy models

karl, is there no end to your vast knowledge? i never realized there were
3 different models... did they make 3 models every year or just after a
certain time? my 70 has the camp stool and all your usual poptop stuff
but i have no stove. i didnt think they installed stoves until later.

btw- where can i look for this P#?

mine is called a &quot;campmobile&quot;, little sticker on the side of the sink, i
think. but i have heard of one called a &quot;day camper&quot;. would this be what
the hard top westy would be called? or was it a later year thing? perhaps
it was a vanagon thing? i know i have heard of them, but now i am curious
just exactly what they are.

bowing to karl's superior intellect...
chris

ps~ have you ever considered being on &quot;win ben stein's money&quot;? write to
them and tell them they need to have a VW episode... *giggle*

... For camper aficionados: is there sensible reason why the interior is
&gt; &gt; Westfalia camperized but there is no poptop?
&gt; 
&gt; It is a non-poptop Westy. Westfalia made 3 models:
&gt; P-21 has no poptop. Has sink, cooler, bed in back, main table in 
&gt; rear, childs cot in front.
&gt; P-22 has poptop. All of above, and bed in top.
&gt; P-27 is the deluxe Westy. All of the above plus 2 burner stove, 
&gt; fridge instead of cooler, front table, storage container/stool between
front seats.
