The throw out bearing is a sealed unit that has grease in it.  The dealer
will tell you &quot;the grease is good for the life of the bearing&quot;, but in
reality &quot;the bearing is good for the life of the grease&quot;!!

Pull out your throw out bearing and toss it!!  While your in there, change
the front main crankshaft seal, pressure plate, clutch disk and if you are
able, pull the throw out bearing release arm and grease that too.  And to do
a really, really good job, now is the time to put in a new starter bushing!!

&gt; &quot;The clutch release bearing is a maintenance-free item.  However, if it is
&gt; noisy, the plastic facing should be lubricated through a hole drilled in the
&gt; transmission case as shown in Fig 15-12.&quot;
