Subject: Tune Up!!!  Mr Super Tune Here!!!

Volks,
  I posted my problem and got some help but did not explain what Im working 
with well enough. I have a 72 pancake that I rebuilt and put 1800 P &amp; Cs, it 
has a single carb solex 2 barrell and the distributor is vacum less.
 Before I did a tune up and it ran real well other than sometimes wanted to 
die everyonce in a while when Id come to a stop. Power felt excellent.
 I put in new points, plugs, rotor,distr cap and basically what they sell at 
bus depot for a tune up. I set the dwell at 48 set the timing at +5 and it 
wont idle at all below about 1200  and then for no apparent reason it will 
take off idling up to 2000rpm +-. It also continues to rev when you push the 
accelerator as in it feels like the cable is sticking and then it releases 
but it does the same when you hand manippulate it from the engine 
compartment. I drove 40 miles and it smelled hot and also smells like a 
preigniting american made car.
 Sorry Im so long just want to try to explain my problems.Basically it runs 
like caca.

  Thankyou for the help,

   David
   AKA  &quot; Mr Super Tune &quot;
