Subject: Re: [T2] removing dash

Richard,

I was thinking of the &quot;screws&quot; that hold the metal-upper dash to the front of
the bus.
The ones you're referencing are &quot;nuts/studs&quot; that hold the two pieces of the
dash together.
These are harder to access, and I don't know if Bob would need to, unless he
wanted to completely remove the upper portion of the dash.

Billy

&gt; &gt; With the windshield out, it's real easy to undo the 5 or 6 screws that
hold
&gt; &gt; the upper, metal portion of the dash to the front sheet metal of the bus.

&gt; Two hold on the the glove box handle, two are in the corners (hard
&gt; to reach), and the other two/three are behind the speedo/heater
&gt; levers. Check this photo to see the ones in the middle:
