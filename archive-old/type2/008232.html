Subject: foil sticker on elec. hook up hood
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I just wanted to say how much I appreciate the list and what I have
learned from it. Even after wading through piles of useless rag
chewing,head biting chit chat,Iam still here and still hungry for more
vw knowlege that I might be able to pass it along to others.          
    Oh well enough rambling,my question is where does one get a
replacement foil sticker that goes on the exterior of the 110 plug
hood? I am restoring a 71 westfalia and my sticker is tattered and
unreadable. If unavailable I think I could have one(or many)made if I
could get a facsimile. thanks for your help.
P.S. I remember someone else had a simular foil sticker question about
the one on the turn signal.
