Subject: Re: [T2] Mix in gas tank

Speaking of odd mixtures in the gas tank, I was told to throw a couple of
ounces of ATF in (to clean up the deposits from running rich) every other
tank of gas.  I swear it did seem to run better after I did this, althougth
I haven't pulled it apart to see if it actually cleaned anything up.

Is this an old mechanic's tale or is there something to this?

Happy New Year!

&gt; You know... One time somebody told me to put in a little bit of motor
&gt; oil with each tank of gas, like a tenth of a quart of oil to a full tank
&gt; of gas. He said, &quot;Now Paul, I know I've got some strange quarks, but I
&gt; know that it's good for the engine. It'll help keep it lubricated
&gt; better. It may smoke a little.&quot;
