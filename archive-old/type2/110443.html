&lt;&lt; OPERATOR HEAT is a major shortcoming of the VW van, small engine, big
interior.  check to see if yours has a gas aux, many Cdn vans had em and
they are about the only things that really work to keep it warm.
 &gt;&gt;

If you're not using the back of the van for people (or if you hate 'em),
there's always a clear plastic drape to separate the cab from the car-
go area...There's a transverse bar in the roof right above the seats
that's placed perfectly for this...Hit a rag shop that carries upholstery
material for heavy clear plastic...
