Subject: RE: [T2] Bumper question

I had the bumpers from my CE restored last year.  By restored, I mean they 
look better than new now.

They removed the big bend/crunches in the rear one, plug welded a couple of 
thin spots, painted the inside, and rechromed the outsides.  I was amazed 
at the quality and straightness of them as I was sure they would reject the 
rear one as &quot;Unrepairable&quot;. The chrome looks &quot;deep&quot;, much more sheen than 
new, I believe.

I paid $550 for the pair. They quoted this sight unseen based on the year 
and model, so I believe it is a flat rate for these and not per hour.

I dropped them off locally (Madison, wi) and they were shipped from there 
to Minneapolis.  Took 5 weeks.

&gt; I called some places within 150 miles of me and they all wanted $300 
&gt; *per* bumper to rechrome...and had a 6 month waiting list...due to EPA
&gt; I  suspect.
&gt; 
&gt; Let me know what you find out as I still have my originals stashed away
&gt; in case it gets cheaper.
