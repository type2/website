&gt; Hello List,
&gt; This system is made to inject a

Without adding air, all this does is richen the mixture.  If you have a
closed loop system (oxygen sensor) your FI will compensate by injecting
less gas.

&gt; The name of the system is &quot;Mizer system&quot;.
&gt; It claims not be be a &quot;Bullydog&quot; or a &quot;Powershot&quot;
&gt; system.

Well, thank goodness for that, whatever those are!

&gt; It is a system that claimes to increase MPG,

It will increase MPG unless you count the
propane used!

&gt; increase the octane level,

Probably, since propane is high-octane

&gt; and make the engine run cooler.

Yes, rich mixtures run cooler.

&gt; IT is listed for $250.

Yow!  You can get the same effect by going to a richer main jet.
