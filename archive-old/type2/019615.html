Yeah, I wasn't sure about the rubber used inside the valve.  The one I
have now looks just like a schraeder valve, just with a slightly bigger
thread.  There is also a smaller version too..

&gt; &gt;p.s. Steve D., yeah, I could've used a tire schraeder valve, but I'm a
&gt; &gt;little paranoid that it would leak after a while.  I've had a spraying
&gt; &gt;fuel hose before.. :)
&gt; 
&gt; Though Porsche use tirevalve-like thingies. They are usually placed
&gt; on the end of a fuel rail, and covered with a nut, Porsche test gauges
&gt; fit straight onto them. The valves used might have special
&gt; fuel resistant seals. I've never used it, only assisted a collegue who
&gt; was hooking up the test gauges, thought I'd share what I saw :-)
