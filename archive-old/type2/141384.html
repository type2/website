Subject: Lights won't stay on main beam

This is easy I think but just in case there is anything else I need to know.

My lights won't stay on main beam. I flick the stalk, the relay clicks and 
the lights are on main beam. Let got of the stalk and the lights are back on 
dipped. Even the indicator light on the dash is illuminated.

I think this means a duff relay. But it's not that old so I wonder if this 
is the problem ? I replaced the old one because it stuck on main beam.

Perhaps I should swap them over depending on the light I want :-) Of course 
I don't know where the old relay is...

Suggestions ?

Thanks

Phil
