&lt;&lt; Hi Bus Friends,
 
 I recently bought a bus, and have been getting it in daily driver 
 condition (Eric, Barb, and Clara have been incredible with their help). 
 
 My engine is rebuilt. It has an alternator, not a generator. The red 
 light stays on at idle (the engine is generally idling a little slow, but 
 better than it was), and then appears to go off during normal driving. 
 However, when driving in the dark, I've noticed that the light actually 
 doesn't go off completely--it sort of glows softly. It just isn't bright 
 enough to notice during the day.
 
 Should I be suspicious of a belt, or should I start elsewhere (or just 
 not worry about it)?
 
 Also, on another topic, I don't want to start a holy war, but what is the 
 best kind of fuel to put in my bus (i.e. octane) and is it important to 
 use a lead substitute? (I understand that there is a concern for engine 
 wear when some grades of unleaded are used.
 
 Thanks all,
 
 Dan,

  Don't ignore it, it could cost you a battery. I have had this happen,
although my problem involved a generator not an alternator, it turned out to
be the voltage regulator. Contacts were sticking causing light to stay dimly
lit. Check or have the voltage regulator checked by someone. The voltage
regulator on most alternators were internal to the alternator. Hope this
helps.
