&gt; My muffler on my 77 westy just broke right off at the heaterbox triangle,
&gt; leaving it's triangle piece still attached to the heater box. The strap that
&gt; goes up to the alum. fan  housing assembly is what is leaving it from dropping
&gt; down. I went to remove the bolt on the fan housing to remove the strap but it
&gt; is just turning around and around.
&gt; What I need to know is whether that is a tapped hole in the housing (that is
&gt; prob stripped now), or is it a nut and bolt that goes right through? Surely it
&gt; is a threaded hole in the housing?? The reason the muffler prob broke there is
&gt; the strap was loose from the P.O. and when I started to investigate found it
&gt; couldn't be tightened, just spins.
&gt; Thanks,

It is a threaded hole. With the eliminator muffler the hole is always
stripped, the magnesium can't take the weight. When I do those eliminator
mufflers, I re-tap the hole and put a stud in there, then a nut. The stud
makes the connection much stronger.
