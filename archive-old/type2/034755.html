Subject: Rec. Vehicle or Daily Driver?

I live in Chicago and need a car as result of job
change which takes me over 25 miles from home.  I have
wanted a bus for a long, long time, and am wondering
if I can satisfy my need for a daily driver and a bus
at the same time.  Concerns about bus as daily driver
are reliability and, being in the snow belt, heat.  Is
a 21 - 31 year old vehicle a good candidate for what I
need?  I know there are a lot of choices, but as an
alternative I lean towards buying a late model
american something and keep putting the bus on my wish
list under the category of weekend recreation.  On the
other hand, I am impressed by what I've been reading
from the list members and their love of their buses. 
I have never felt that way about any US car I've ever
had. The group's comments and suggestions are welcome.
 Thanks for the band width.
