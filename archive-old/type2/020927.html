&gt; &gt;How tight should I tourqe the nuts on the exhaust ports on my 2 litre, I
&gt; &gt;think they are loose because I put a big boulbus exhaust on and it rattled
&gt; &gt;and such
&gt;
&gt; Eric- rather than give you that torque spec, let me suggest
&gt; that you look at the additional supports for the original equipment
&gt; heat exchangers, and make sure you have something there.
&gt; If you are supporting the whole thing on the exhaust ports alone
&gt; you will be back asking how to replace broken head studs very soon.

Dave:
It's too bad somebody doesn't repro these parts as it's probably been years
since they've been seen on dealer shelves and many people have no idea what
they even look like. Should be easy to do, 4 different parts for bays and 3, I
think, for Vanagons.
Anyone out there with such experience? (getting a small production run of parts
made?)
Is perhaps anyone in Britain or the continent doing it? (Just Kampers or the
like?)
