&gt; Sounds like the &quot;Temp Sensor 2&quot; might be bad.  It's the one that lives on top
&gt; of the haed on cyl. #3.  Tells the ECU how warm the engine is.  Might want to
&gt; take your Ohmmeter and check it.  Don't have my Bentley handy, but I think
&gt; that it should be around 2k ohms cold and decreasing to around 600 ohms warm. 
&gt; Maybe someone could check those values...

Head temp. sensor should not excede 2500 ohms at 68F.  That's all Bently
says.  Maybe somebody with some other manuals might see if they give
the values over a range of temps.
