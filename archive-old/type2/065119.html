Subject: FS '71? westy

I called Herbie's VW Hideaway looking for some parts for my '77 westy,
unfortunately they didn't have any but they did have a '71 (the guy thought
it was a '71) Westy  and they are asking $1200.  This place is located in
Rome (central) NY state.  I am not affiliated with this place at all but
thought I would pass on the word.  Their number can be found in the back
pages of Hot VWs or if you can't find that write to me and I can probably
get you the number by Monday.
Good luck if anyone is interested,
Brett
