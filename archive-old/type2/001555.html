Subject: Distributor removal folly?? 
Date: Fri, 20 Jul 2001 19:28:29 -0500

Yesterday I removed the distributor on my 1977 type 2 with vacuum advance to
put in a new set of points. The engine wouldn't start, realized that the
distributor wasn't all the way down pushed it down and the Bus started up.
Set dwell and then timing, bus ran well. Headed into town 7 mi away still
running well, but as we got back it died in the driveway. The bus had been
running daily before yesterday with out major problems so suspect my work
yesterday screwed it up? It acted like it ran out of gas even though gauge
said quarter tank? Put more gas in and it started up but I was still suspect
as the gauge has always been accurate, tried town again to get a full tank
and see how low the gas really was, ran ok to town put in 7 gal? On the way
home running a little rough and when I slowed for a stop sign just short of
home it died again? Both times when it died the starter-engine would turn
over but no start, both times after the bus cooled off it started right up?
Now I'm thinking I installed the dist. wrong, but if so would it run at all,
would it cause these symptoms? Should I take it off and try again and if so
what's the best way to fine tdc for #1 cylinder (I've always found it by
matching the mark on the dist. with the rotor).

Any thought or help thanks in advance,

Ray
