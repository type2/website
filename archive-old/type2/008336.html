	 Well, a lot of my space is filled with the clothes I need to wear
   to work everyday -- a job, I might add, where jeans are verboten. What I
   miss most (other than my wife and my dog) are my books, but those along
   would fill my bus. 

Speaking of books, I've found that libraries are wonderful havens for
travellers, especially when in a busy city where withdrawing for some
peace is difficult. In addition to recreational reading, a library
is an excellent resource for non-biased local information. Just about 
any other information source for travellers will be biased towards
places that part you from your money as quickly as possible.
Even better, many libraries now have internet terminals. Only 
problem is that figuring out how to rlogin to get and send mail
can be tricky and an activity viewed with suspicion bu the locals.

One thing that irritates me is that when staying for a while in a
place it would be nice to get a library card and be able to check out
books. That priviledge usually requires a residence street address, which 
may not be so easy to come up with. (Although people who are regulars
in a particular park can usually use that as a residence address.) 

   OTOH, I have had a life-long wish to live the simple
   life of a forest monk. I see these guys here with the giant packs
   wandering the highways, living a very minimalist existence, and wonder
   how that would be. 

The key thing to ask here is it by choice or necessity?

	 My wife and I, our two children, and a dog and a cat all lived in
   our '69 bus (a non-westy) and a tent for 3 months, traveling the US and
   Canada the summer of '71, I think it was. We seemed to have things much
   better organized than what I have right now.

Remember the days when even a regular family with two or thre kids would
set out for vacation in a VW bug? Now suburbanites have been brainwashed 
to believe that a family won't fit in anything smaller than a mini-van
or suv.

	 What I probably should have is a top carrier -- I've got a long
   one that fits on my Yakima racks, that I use for my sails, booms, and
   related sailboard stuff, but I left that all at home because I can't
   windsurf right now due to some recent surgery -- but anyway, a nice
   square top carrier that would fit right on the &quot;luggage rack&quot; area, and
   still let you pop the top. A lot of the stuff filling up the built-in
   Westy storage spaces could really go in that. 

I used canoeing type dry bags on the roof carrier. Comes in up to
70litres (as big as a suitcase). The roof carrier fits 2-4 depending
on size. Totally waterproof and easy to hoist up and tie down.
