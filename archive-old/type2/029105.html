Hi all,

My '69 Westi still has the original smooth top, no ribs or bumps near the
pivot bolts.  I am NOT a fan of this top.  It has numerous stress cracks
near the bolts as well as along the vertical portions, and will NOT stay
down in the wind.  I have resorted to tying it down with a cargo strap
running gutter to gutter.

As soon as I find a ribbed replacement for a reasonable cost withing driving
distance, I'm there.
