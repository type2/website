&gt;Hello all...I am in the process of restoring a 1974 bus that I got when &gt;my
brother died.  I used to drive it all the time until it needed work.  &gt;Now I
am in the process of fixing everything that is wrong with it...the &gt;problem
is...I'm eager to drive it...chipped paint and all...My question &gt;is...would
it be out of line to drive it or should I wait until I have it fixed &gt;100%
to drive it?

If most of us waited until our busses were 100% before driving them, we'd
never get them on the road! As long as it's safe and sound, drive it and
enjoy! My 74 needs lots of stuff, but nothing that keeps it from being a
really cool ride.

Dave
