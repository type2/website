&gt;Research foam nomenclature.  (Learn the difference
&gt;between 1823 foam, and 2347 foam.  Most craft stores
&gt;carry 15xx and lower- very low quality for padding or
&gt;upholstery.)  Select the grade you wish, and know the
&gt;dimensions.  Then buy it through an upholstery shop. 

I did not know the technical nomenclature of the
various foams available.  Foam seen at craft stores
was too thin and too soft.  I had a friend in the
upholstry business for 20 years get my new foam.

&gt;An upholstery shop will be able to get the correct
&gt;brick of foam, at exactly the correct dimensions you
&gt;need.  You should plan to trim the foam down if there
&gt;are S curves or exotic shapes.  You can have the foam
&gt;supplier do exotic trimming, but you will pay exotic
&gt;prices for that trimming.  Good luck.

If you want to do it yourself, try trimming the foam
with an electric carving knife.

Last July, I was able to un-staple the original seat
covering (gold cloth) in my SO42 interior.  Machine
washed it twice on the delicate cycle.  Twice, because
the first time the wash water looked like coffee. :-P
Clothesline dried the covers.  Then I handed off the
plywood seat bases and the covering to my friend. He
took it from there, finishing the job for $120.
