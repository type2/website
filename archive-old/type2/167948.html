The 71  is a one year old VW engine as it was the only bus the US got that had
a  type 1 dual port. And it was also the only one with disc brakes. I'm  
unaware
of any turnkey engines that will come with the correct size port  for the 71
bus brake booster line that goes all the way up front for the  brake servo.

Thus the manifold that came with the 71 buses was a one  year old part. You 
can
take a new intake manifold (aftermarket ones are  pretty crappy quality that
I've seen) and tap in a port that you will need  for your power brakes. IMO
it's easier to just use your old one (hopefully  still in solid shape).




Hey Guys     This is true only on buses as 1971 was the  only year it came 
on. . This manifold was also  found on all bugs with auto  trans from 1971 thur 
1974 .  Now on motors I have been building them for 20  plus years and the 
only way I do them is turn key .you bring  me  your bus and I do the motor 
including installing and when you come get the bus  you get in it and turn the key 
and drive away.  I have found that this is  the best way to do this kind of 
job.  later  mark  d
