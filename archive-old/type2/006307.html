Erik,

Happy Friday!

Said &quot;unknown snippet&quot; is by none other than Mr. Jim Morrison, aka The
Doors.  It comes from an 11 minute epic called &quot;The end&quot;... one of the
classic classics by the Doors.   And, to be precise, tehre are two lines

1.  The Blue bus....is calling us
2. Meet me at the back of the ...blue bus... in the ...blue bus.... etc.

Very Psychadelic yet  morose,  one of Jim's most contraversial songs.  Well
worth a listen, on most compilations.

Peace, man


Dave T
