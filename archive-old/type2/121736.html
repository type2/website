Subject: Re: [T2] Adjusting flaps/thermostat when in a warm climate?

&gt;Adjust it at night per the bentley book and you'll be fine.  It 
&gt;really starts expanding around 100 degrees anyways, so I don't 
&gt;think it's really that big of a deal.

Just to throw in my nickel's worth, I'd like to say that no matter how you
do the initial adjust on your thermostat (talking type IV here), the VERY
FIRST TIME you drive the bus enough to get the engine warmed up good you
should verify that the cable has allowed the flaps to open fully.  

Thermostats almost always fail in the open (hot) position.  So if you adjust
your thermostat on a cold engine (ie. with the flaps closed) then they'll
never open!

If you're not sure, warm the bus up real good then loosen the cable clamp
just enough to let the spring on the flaps push the flaps all the way open
then tighten the clamp again.  This will at least fool-proof you against a
faulty thermostat and insure that your flaps are fully open when your engine
is warm-to-hot.
