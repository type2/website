&gt; Not so, Tony!  Chinese industry has some of the worst environmental
&gt; practices and are predicted to only become worse. Developing nations
&gt; for the most part have poorer environmental practices because they are
&gt; mostly interested in developing economically and not in being &quot;green&quot;.
&gt; Environmentally sound practices are primarily the realm of nations
&gt; with a strong enough economy to support so called &quot;green&quot; industrial
&gt; practices.
