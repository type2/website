Subject: very low emissions at inspection

The '75 bus actually failed inspection this morning because of a
deteriorating brake hose and I'm glad the mechanic found that problem.
I'll replace the pair later today. 

The bright side, however, are the pretty low emission results:  HC at 107
ppm (600ppm allowed) and CO at a tiny 0.09% (6.00% allowed)!  Note that
this 1.8 liter fuel injected type 4 engine (California model)  has no
catalytic converter and its EGR system is broken (thus disabled).

Compare with the results from the previous couple of years: 154 ppm HC
and 4.15% CO in '94 (135,xxx miles), 448 ppm HC and 2.41 % CO in '95 (_at_
140,xxx miles)

A few things were done to the engine over the last 12 months:
*Heads rebuilt, new rings, barrels honed,
*Bosch Platinum plugs,
*installed CD ignition and increased spark plug gap from .28 to .40.

I'll leave the one-data-point factor analysis to others, but I'll place my
bet on the CDI as the main reason for the improvement.
