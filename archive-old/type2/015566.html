Yes, quite a logical explanation. I, as well, will be unavailable the first
two weeks of July. I dread the clammor of catching up to two weeks build up
of demand when I get back. There are always a few that will take it as a
personal affront that they had to wait 2 weeks for a responce, then fall in
line 2 weeks hence to commit to the schedule. A 190SL is being resurrected
when I get back. Made the motor run sweet this week, now there's more
torque than the worn clutch can handle. He also has a 280SE, original
owner, 335k. Motor rebuilt at 225k. It is also scheduled for when I get
back for a general inspection to determine the costs of putting things
right for another 100k or more.
