&gt;I agree with most everything you said, but a few remarks:
&gt;1. I agree that lightening a flywheel will make you need to be more
&gt;careful letting out the clutch, however, once that clutch is out
&gt;(provided the engine is still running) a lighter flywheel will help a
&gt;lot. I installed an aluminum wheel on my 1960 Corvette-283, Rochester
&gt;FI, 10/1 pistons, mild H-268 degree cam- higher, quicker lift. The cam
&gt;and the wheel were the only substantive changes. WOW, what a difference!
&gt;I can remember driving this thing in 1969 and having a lot of trouble
&gt;passing people on 2-lane roads- no more! I think the lighter wheel was
&gt;the biggest change.

I don't doubt your experience, however mine was a bit different.  I
installed an aluminum flywheel in my '87 Mustang - 302, FI, 9.5/1, 245RWHP,
and noticed almost zero difference.  I think it revs a bit quicker with the
clutch out, but actual acceleration numbers didn't change much, at least
from what I can tell after 50+ passes down the quarter mile.

&gt;HOWEVER! Is this Westy a sports car or a truck? Right now it's set up
&gt;like a truck. I think Matthew could be quite happy taking something off
&gt;the flywheel. 

I just can't agree with that.  The Westy is so heavy and the engine so
underpowered that I can't imagine there being any noticeable increase in
acceleration.  My reasoning is that if I can't tell the difference in a
high horsepower, low weight car, I *really* wouldn't be able to tell in the
bus.  Plus there's the fact that the bus flywheel is not all that heavy to
begin with - I seem to remember that it was around 11 lbs.  And I do think
that lightening the flywheel will make it harder to launch smoothly.  If I
could, I would add weight to the flywheel in my bus, not remove it.  As you
pointed out, it's a truck, not a sports car.  

I care more about top speed and hill pulling ability in my bus since it's a
long-haul vehicle, and neither one of these things are affected by the
weight of the flywheel.  I could have a 100lb flywheel and my bus would go
just as fast, and pull hills just as well.

&gt;3. High ratio rockers, not too bad, I'm sure they will reduce cam life
&gt;some, but is this a BIG problem in stock setup? I've seen many cams that
&gt;I wouldn't reuse, but many that were just fine.

I've seen many engines with worn cams, and only one with a cam that I would
reuse, and it was from a low-mileage engine.  However I'm willing to admit
that my experiences are not enough to warrant a generalization at this
point, just an opinion.  :)

&gt;7. I think to get much more HP you're going to need a bigger induction
&gt;system. Maybe modify 2.1 Vanagon parts to work. They are 90-100 HP
&gt;range.

I definately agree with this one!
