        You can get noise supression devices at radio-shack.  I don't have

       &quot;This year will go down in history.
        For the first time a civilized 
        nation has full gun registration!
        Our streets will be safer,
        our police more efficient,
        and the world will follow
        our lead into the future!&quot;
