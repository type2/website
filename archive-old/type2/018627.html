These people bought out the stock of Johnnys Speed and Chrome (Jiffy Plating) 
when it went out of business, so if you're looking for that great type I &amp; 4 
bench valve spring removal tool, they have it for 24.95. I just got me one. 
Minimum order is 25 bucks and the shipping takes awhile, but the quality of 
the tool appears alright -we'll see when I start using it.
