Subject: [T2] Dizzy vac can

Well my local Import FLAPS said a big fat &quot;no way&quot; to a rebuild kit for a
vac can for a 205S and said &quot;that'll be $75, and a week&quot; for a new can.
Well, I don't have $75 for a new can.  Anybody have a used, but working,
vacuum canister for a Bosh 205S?  I would gladly pay for it, just not $75
:).
