&gt; The nosecones are the same size, the 091 one will work. It's also much
&gt; better than the early ones, I just put one on my 70 transmission.

Hello Tom  Yes I thought they would be the same but the point is to inspect 
the shift linkage inside the nosecone before puttint it in. I have seen a bunch 
of the brackets break in there and the time to check is before installing, 
also good time to look at the front bearings.  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
