&gt; most VW speedometers I have seen have the shift points marked with little
&gt; red hashes,  I, II, III.
&gt;
&gt; this is a good guide until you get to know your engine/trans/bus

I know about these speedometers but mine doesn't have 'em. It's an original
gauge too. Using the gear ratio, we calculated that I'm probably shifting at
about 3500 rpm which is good. I don't shift consistantly yet though. I need
more practice. Goodie!  :-)
