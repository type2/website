&gt;Yes, you just totally screwed up.
&gt;Indeed, you COULD just set cylinders 1 and 3, and cylinders 2 and 4
&gt;while the engine was in the same position, except that cylinder 3 has
&gt;its timimg event (and fires) 360 crankshaft degrees after that of
&gt;cylinder 1, which is half of a cycle (180 CAMSHAFT degrees) away from
&gt;the heel of the camshaft lobes (which is where you want to adjust for
&gt;clearance).

Hmmm. I told him he was fine. One of us is way wrong. It is almost
certainly me, Ian. This is an easy experiment to prove, just go point the
rotor at #1 and do the thing right. Then point the rotor at #3 and check
the clearance on #1 because I would like to know the empirical answer to
this.
