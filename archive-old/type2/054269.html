Subject: master cylinder replacement and brake bleeding

Hello All, I've replace master cylinder of 70 Bus and now I am having LOTS of 
trouble bleeding brakes.  I can't seem to get all of air out of master 
cylinder and brake lines.  If there is air in master cylinder shouldn't I 
just be able to bleed it out at wheel cylinders?  I filled master cylinder 
with brake fluid before reinstalling.  I have searched for leaks or openings 
for air to enter in but have come up empty.  There is a screw on master 
cylinder between were brake lines attach, does anyone know it purpose, should 
I try to bleed master cylinder through this?  Never in my life have I had 
such difficulty bleeding brakes any suggestions are most welcomed.  Thanks, 
Marcus
