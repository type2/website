The problem is, they've got their foot in the door with red light cameras.
Once we allowed one computer to be judge, jury and executioner over us, we
OK'd them all.

Interesting that they place the smog vans at onramps, where the worst
case smog scenario is likely.  The engines are likely to be cold, they
are under hard acceleration, and gearshifts will result in abrupt change
in  throttle position with accompanying enrichment from the accel pump.

How long before we have to go to high exhausts and license plate flippers
to avoid the sensors?

OTOH, I can see some prankster sitting at the unattended sniffer site
with a mister bottle of gasoline, puffing a spritz of gas into the sensor
beam every time a SUV lumbers past...
