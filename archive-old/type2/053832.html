Subject: What kind of engine

I'm curious about your opinions about what is the 'best' engine for a '72
bus.  I've heard that 1700's are the most stable, as in live the longest and
are most durable, but it was just one person's opinion.
I'm toying with the idea of building an engine.  I don't want to pull my
1700 from my bus as it runs and I need it running, but it would be a great
learning experience, etc.  I'd be in no hurry as it would be a project and
not a rebuild to get my bus running kind of thing.

I would like to have a reliable motor with a decent amount of power.  I.e. I
can cruise down the road at 70 mph on a flat-ish highway without worrying
about blowing the engine up and I don't have to fiddle with the carbs/jets
every time the weather changes or I change my altitude by a 1000 feet.

I keep hearing about Porsche engines, V6's, Japanese motors, hydraulic
lifters and electronic ignitions, rubberbands used by NASA and hamsters on
Crack being used.

Any thoughts?
