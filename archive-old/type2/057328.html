Subject: RE: Bob Hoover

[...]

&gt;&gt; Bob Hoover   -  forgive them, for they know not what they do..... &lt;&lt;

If only this were true.....

Unfortunately, I believe &quot;they&quot; know PRECISELY &quot;what they do&quot;.  

Further, we should all, individually and collectively, be ashamed that this 
has been allowed to happen.  

In &quot;their&quot; monumental selfishness, arrogance, and childish inability to deal 
with criticism &quot;they're&quot; determined to drag the entire List down with them.

Bob Hoover's only &quot;fault&quot;, which is not a &quot;fault&quot; at all but a shining virtue, 
is that he speaks the truth and answers inquiries with precision, clarity, and 
brevity.

What possible purpose, useful or otherwise, is served by asking for an answer 
to a perceived problem and then chastising and vilifying the person responding 
because the inquirer isn't pleased with the answer?

&quot;Truth&quot; IS.....

&quot;Reality&quot; IS.....

Throwing a tantrum because one doesn't wish to accept Truth or Reality doesn't 
change or affect the Truth or Reality one iota.  All it accomplishes is 
fatigue and humiliation on the part of the person throwing the tantrum, and 
bystanders (or fellow List members) are progressively embarrassed, annoyed, 
and angered.

This sort of behavior is unacceptable in a Kindergarten environment.  It is 
ABSOLUTELY INTOLERABLE within a &quot;community&quot; of &quot;adults&quot;.

It is my fervent hope that the &quot;silent majority&quot; of List members will realize 
the enormity of what has been allowed to happen here, express their collective 
outrage loudly and clearly, and succeed in persuading Bob Hoover to resume his 
hard-earned and well-deserved position as Elder and Adviser in this (quite 
literally) world-wide &quot;community&quot;.
