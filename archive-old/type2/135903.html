&lt;&lt; To make a very long story short... I like to run my old vehicles every few
months, get the motors warm, move them a little so they're not sitting on
the same spot on the tires and to remind the mice that these are not put
here for them to use as mobile homes.  &gt;&gt;

A couple bucks worth of &quot;Irish Spring&quot; soap left in and around the vehicle
seems to repel the l'il critters...This is from a couple of other chronolog-
ically challenged car lists I'm on so it might really work... ;-)
