Subject: Re: [T2] Driving with open engine compartment

I once had a fuel pump go out on me whilst on the road.  I tore the engine 
halfway down in situ by the interstate trying to figure out what was wrong.  
I could drive for a while, then it would quit.  Then I could drive for a 
while again, then it would quit.  I finally called my mechanic, Merle, and he 
told me that the fuel pump was toast.  I could try pouring cold water over it 
whenever it happened again and/or I could try driving down the road with the 
engine hatch open to keep the peripherals on the engine a little cooler.  I 
did both.  I don't know for sure if driving with the hatch open helped or 
not, but I limped on home that way, stopping and pouring iced tea (what I had 
on hand) over the fuel pump whenever it quit, then going again.
