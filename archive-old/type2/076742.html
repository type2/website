Subject: RE: F.S. Banjo fittings for oil-pressure gauge sender installation


&gt;&gt;Instead of thread locker (Loc-Tite) get a bottle of hydraulic system
&gt;&gt;sealant (also made by Loc-Tite).

Yeah, I actually used Permatex (by LocTite as well) which I use to seal valve cover gaskets and occasionally window seals or those 
pesky windshield squirt valves. I does not fully harden, depending on the one you get. They claim you can goop it on in place of a 
gasket. I have used it for many things. Throw it in your multi-use toolbox along side your roll of duct tape and your swiss army knife.
