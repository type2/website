Subject: Re: [T2] dropped vavle seat and parts needed and thanks to
  everyone

&gt;  It has been my findings that you had better take  both heads
&gt; off.
&gt;

Plus there's satisfaction in knowing you were able to torque both heads at
the same time to matching specs. Whether there's any truth to better
longevity cross torquing the heads, you can at least be absolutely certain
they're the same and eliminate that possible issue from your worry pot.
