&gt; should I stick to 55mph or am I paranoid and should
&gt; go 70mph?  Does anyone
&gt; having experience with driving I10 through NM and AZ
&gt; have something that I
&gt; should know. &gt; 

Chris-

I have the same set-up pushing a 74 bus around Laredo and Northern
Mexico. I haven't had any problems with overheating so far. My bus
seems happiest around 3500- 3600rpm. Any higher and temps go up and
mileage goes down. YMMV
