HEllo YALL,

I successfully designed a rear disc brake replacement for my 1970 240Z 
that originally had rear drums. Incidentally, I also designed a setup for 
the front of the DATSUN that used vented rotors with 4piston calipers. It 
was VERY NICE, stops on a dime with no fade in the mountains, and still a 
few bugs to be worked out.

FYI,

To put rear disc brakes on the back of the bus would require the following:

* A bracket made out of steel or alum that the caliper would mount to
        ( a very lengthy measuring process, I assure you to figure out 
                the right specs)

* the right calipers that will
        fit under the wheel
        have a parking brake option
        have smaller pistons than the front calipers
              (This balances the brakes so the rears do not lock up)

* A proportioning valve (balances pressure between fr and rr and adjustable
                        by you)
* make a rear hub assembly for the brake disc to mount to if needed

* find a disc that will work (orig 71 disc might work w/ hub assembly)

* a master cyl and vac booster that will work (must know volume of fluid 
        pushed - i.e. diameter of m/c and the stroke length)
        The master cyl must be matched up to the calipers you use on 
                four corners of your vehicle (must know the area of the
                pistons of calipers in relation to the volume of fluid pushed
                by the m/c - vol divided by area gives you the distance moved
                by the pistons in the calipers


Just wanted you to know what you are getting into. My design for my 240Z 
took me 6months to design. Of course, it was the first time I had done 
anything that extensive (all 4 corners upgraded). This time around, it 
would be quicker. I do own a 71 bus, and I would first like to see about 
the braking stock before I change anything. I do admit that the thought 
had crossed my mind to upgrade the brakes, BUT  I  KNOW BETTER!!!!!
If it aint broke (BRAKE?) dont fix it! I will let you know how it goes - 
I do think it would be cool to have upgraded brakes on a bus.
