Subject: FS: Bay Window Tent - GONE!! Virginia

I am sorry to announce that I no longer have the
tent for sale.

It has gone to a new home.   Thank you all for
your inquiries.

Now, may we consider

1) Waste Basket Seat  from '74- $75

2) Super Clean Front Axle Beam from '78 - $100

3) Black Ladder from '73 -  $10 (previous
interested party, speak up now, or forever ...)
