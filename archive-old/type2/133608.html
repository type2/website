Subject: Re: [T2] Mahle Oil Filter

i need to admit i am no air cooled expert most of my experience comes from
the wasserboxer as i have only owned one air cooled 79 safare and that was
quite a few years ago.  anyhow on the boxer at least, the filter is not on
the bottom of the engine but, above the oil pump and just below the center
line of the crank.  all i know from experience is that with the hydraulic
lifters you want that check valve in the filter so that the lifters don't
click.  perhaps someone else can provide a better technical explanation
than i can.

&gt; ? The filter is in the bottom of the engine- why does it need any
&gt; drainback valve?  The Mann/Mahle I've seen you can blow in and out of
&gt; the center hole and feel no oneway valve..... not true of some others.
