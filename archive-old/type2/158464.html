To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

 did some tinkering.  pulled off the rocker arms of # 1 and everything
looked fine.  pulled intake pushrod to see if maybe it was what was causing
the 1/4&quot; play.  looked fine.  had my son turn the starter while i watched
the # 1 valves and rockers.  when the turning stopped i checked the intake
vavle again.  it was closed and tight.  did whole thing again.  stopped the
turns when intake was opened.  1/4&quot; play again.  so it would seem the intake
valve is stuck closed.  meaning it will not open.  good.  one more puzzle
piece.  ever put a puzzle together and not have the box lid?  oh, yeah,  put
the compression tester on # 1 again while running starter.  still no
compression and no sound of air escaping from the cylinder or valves.
anyway, thanks for listening, everyone.
