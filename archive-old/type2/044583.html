Subject: [T2] Headlight switch needed

OK i fixed my headlight problem it was caused by my switch i recently 
replaced this switch with a new one from Busdepot. I was not to happy with it 
to begin with but it worked. Now i turn it on and i have no headlights. So my 
switch is bad i replaced it with a switch from a friend but they need the 
switch back. if anyone has a extra headlight switch that works let me know.
