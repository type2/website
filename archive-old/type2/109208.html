Subject: RE: [T2] new vaccum advance available?

&gt; I have what I believe to be a good working distributor, but 
&gt; the vaccum is shot on it
&gt; I know I should just suck it up and buy a new 
&gt; rebuilt one, im just really broke right now.


Yes, they're available. We have them, new, from Bosch.

Late '74 to 83 exc. Calif. $34.95
http://www.busdepot_dot_com/busdepot/details.jsp?partnumber=07060
'68 to 70 $44.95
http://www.busdepot_dot_com/busdepot/details.jsp?partnumber=07024

Other years are available, but at higher prices than a sane person would
pay ($90-$150).

By comparison, we have rebuilt replacement vacuum advance distributors
for most years for around $55 to $70, and of course new 009 and 050
centifugal advance ones for about the same price.  So you'll save a bit
just replacing the vacuum canister with a new one, but not a lot.
