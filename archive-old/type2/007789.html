Hi all,

the answers on how to clean the top of my newly purchased 72 westy
have been great and i intend to clean her up this weekend.  thanks to
everyone.

the poptop canvas is original and has absolutely no mildew.  i would
love to keep it this way.  how can one possibly do this in this area?  

please ... any tricks for keeping the canvas mildew free would be much
appreciated by me and Lily (my campmobile).

thanks in advance,

Dale
