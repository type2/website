Subject: Re: [T2] Convert walkthrough to a bench seat?

Hi Don,

It's possible. There were baywindow buses built as non-walk-though 
models, particularly the single-cab and double-cab models.

I have a bus bench seat I am planning to install in my wife's 77 
Sunroof Automatic bus. I am going to have to weld in some supports to 
hold it up, but that shouldn't be too hard to figure out. When I get 
around to it I will be sure to post some pics.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Is it possible to install a bench in the front of my 73? It's
&gt; currently a walkthrough, but I'm going over places to install my &quot;new&quot;
&gt; 77 Westy kitchen, and one possible place would be behind the passenger
&gt; seat and stretching across the aisle.
&gt;
&gt; So: What's the possibility of installing a bench?
