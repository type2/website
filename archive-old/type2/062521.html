Yes, the next camping trip IS happening.  It's going to be at Mammouth
(near Yosemite) Sept. 20-22, and I should have some particulars including
directions for you all soon.  Here's who plans to attend. This'll be
a biggie.  Try and make it if at all possible.  Weather and turnout
should be excellent.  I'll make another post soon.  /martha
