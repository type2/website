Subject: Broken rear shock mount

Folks...

It looks like I have broken the upper rear shock mount on the  
driver's side on my '76 Westy.  The bolt is a bit wobbly and there is  
a squeaking noise when the rear bumper is nudged.  I guess one of the  
spot welds that holds the nut must have broken, maybe when the Konis  
were installed?

Couple of questions:

1. How difficult / expensive is this to fix?

2. Do I absolutely need to stop driving the Bus until I get it fixed?

Thanks!
