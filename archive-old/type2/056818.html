HOW WE SPENT OUR SUMMER VACATION
By George, Marie, Claire, and Tempest
Part 2 of 4, Utah, Idaho, Wyoming

Lone Tree, UT
Don^Òt look for this on a map as it^Òs not a town at all, but simply a
tree standing out in the middle of the desert, alongside UT30, sustained
by an artesian (free flowing) well.  A very refreshing place to stop and
take a break from driving.

Rosette, UT
Park Valley, UT
These consist of about 3 or 4 dwellings each.  Further along UT30, you
can see the Great Salt Lake in the distance to the southeast.

Snowville, UT
Highway town at the junction of UT30 and I-84

Tremonton, UT
Deweyville, UT
Collinston, UT
These three are all clustered together in northern Utah.  Irrigated
ranches mingle with small plots of urban strip malls and the random
general store or two.  We switched to little farm roads and worked out
way over to Logan.

Logan, UT
Home of Utah State University.  

Providence, UT
Hyrum, UT
Paradise, UT
These are little farming communities that _don^Òt_ seem to be dying! 
City folk are moving out to these little towns and joining the local
lifestyle.  Marie^Òs friend Beth lives in Paradise with her husband Dave,
two daughters, two horses, and dog.  Nice place.  Helped Dave replace
the Macpherson struts on his Subaru.  That 2.4l flat four would sure
look good in the back of a water-cooled Vanagon!  After a two-day visit
we headed north on US91

Smithfield, UT
Richmond, UT
Franklin, ID (oldest town is Idaho)
Preston, ID
Mink Creek, ID
Ovid, ID
Montpelier, ID
Geneva, ID 
More little farming towns.  As in Utah, the main feature in each one is
usually a massive Mormon church dominating the center of town.  It
doesn^Òt seem as if sufficient people could live nearby to fill such a
large building.  Then again, Mormons can be prolific.  Some Mormons list
the names of their children on the back of their gravestones.  We
happened upon one that had 17 children listed!  We took ID36 over to
US89 into Wyoming.

Smoot, WY
Afton, WY
The character of the towns changed as we moved into Wyoming.  The price
of gas plummeted to under a dollar a gallon.  Afton is the home of Aviat
aircraft, builders of the famous Pitts special aerobatic airplane.  They
also claim the manufacturer of the most powerful handgun in the world,
so we decided not to burgle any homes while we were in the area!  We
took a drive/hike up to Intermittent Spring, a natural spring that
varies its flow over a period of several minutes.  This spring gushes
out a river of water, but we found our way blocked by leftover snow from
the previous winter, so we didn^Òt hike all the way to the spring
itself.  The spring was not intermittent while we were there, as the
flow rate was too high.  Afton is also home to the world^Òs largest
elkhorn arch.  You have to see this to comprehend its magnificence!

Grover, WY
Thayne, WY
Etna, WY
More nice little Wyoming towns.  Traffic was picking up on US89 as we
were nearing the Grand Tetons and Yellowstone.  Lots of motorhomes.

Alpine, WY
Hoback Jct. WY
Jackson, WY
If you don^Òt like tourist traps, stay out of Jackson.  Traffic, high
prices, and latte-sippers abound.  They have an elkhorn arch too, but
it^Òs a little wimpy thing you can^Òt even drive under!

Kelly, WY
Moran Jct., WY
Along this route you get a wonderful view of the Grand Tetons, a natural
feature so large that the National Park Service hasn^Òt figured out a way
to fence it out of view and charge us to see it.  We had plenty of time
to view the Tetons as we sat in construction zones for quite a while. 
The joke is that Wyoming has two seasons: winter and road repair!  Moran
Jct. is a wonderful place, where all the motorhomes head on northward
into Yellowstone, and happy VW bus drivers head over US 26 on a
virtually empty road.

Dubois, WY
A delightful little town, far enough from Yellowstone to not have been
spoiled too much.  Had a nice dinner at the Cowboy Café and slept next
to the Wind River.  The next morning they were having the annual
celebration at the local museum so we took the kids over to see the
sights.  They had a fellow carving wooden statues with a chain saw,
another who made authentic bows from bighorn sheep horns (yes, you can
straighten those curly horns out!).  A fellow had brought out a
stationary gas engine from the 1920.  This thing had an exposed
crankshaft (you could look up the cylinder and see the bottom of the
piston!) and a &quot;hit or miss&quot; governor.  If the engine went too fast it
simply stopped the valves and ignition from working until it slowed down
to the correct speed.  It wasn^Òt running right, so we fiddled with it
for the better part of an hour until we figured out that the timing had
slipped and that it was firing way too late.  We moved a little slider
on the exhaust valve pushrod to alter the ignition timing and the engine
revved up to its 450 RPM maximum speed!  Loads of fun!

Burris, WY
Crowheart, WY
Crowheart got its name in a rather gruesome way.  Seems that two Indian
tribes had a war going on, and the chiefs decided to meet in one-on-one
combat to decide the issue.  The chief of the Crow tribe lost the fight,
but fought so bravely that the victorious chief displayed the loser^Òs
heart to his tribe.  The place of the battle became known as Crowheart
Butte, and the town took the same name later on.

Morton, WY
Kinnear, WY
Riverton, WY
The Good Sam club was having a convention.  No wonder there were so many
motorhomes and trailers on the road!

Shoshoni, WY
Shoshoni was on its last legs about 8 years ago, but seems to have
livened up a bit.  Several new businesses to serve the traveler.  From
here we headed up US20 through the Wind River Canyon, a very spectacular
route.  You are actually descending as you go through the canyon
northward, but the angle of the rock strata in the canyon walls makes it
seem as if you are climbing.  It also seems as if the river in the
bottom of the canyon is defying gravity and flowing upward!  Wyoming
seems to have a thing for labeling the rock strata, and there are
hundreds of signs along the highway telling the name and age of the
strata as you drive along.

Thermopolis, WY
Thermopolis is one of our favorite places.  Nice warm pools of mineral
water help us relax and keep the kids happy.  (tip: if you go here, buy
a pair of water shoes to wear in the pool.  The warm water will soften
your feet and the mineral deposits will sand them down to tender flesh. 
Ouch!)  The pools have water slides and luckily our kids are now old
enough to handle the slides on their own,  Yippee!  The next day we took
in the Wyoming Dinosaur Center.  This is a privately-run non-profit
outfit that has made recent discoveries near Thermopolis.  They have a
very impressive museum (the kids love those big skeletons!) and also
give tours of their active dig sites.  Very informative and well worth
the money.  While in Thermopolis we stayed at the Cactus Motel (where,
BTW they didn^Òt mind my adjusting the bus^Ò valves and changing oil) and
ate at the Sideboard Café.

Lucerne, WY
Neiber, WY
Worland, WY
At Worland, we had a decision to make.  We could either go over Tensleep
Canyon to Buffalo or go further north on US20 to Greybull and Shell
Canyon.  We^Òd already done Tensleep Canyon (which is beautiful) so we
decided to head north.
Menderson, WY
Greybull, WY
Switched to US 14 here.

Shell, WY
Burgess Jct., WY
I hadn^Òt realized it, but this route involves a climb from 3500 feet to
a bit over 9000 feet, over the continental divide, and then a descent
back to 3500 feet, which is more than a mile up and down all in about 40
miles of driving.  On the way up, some impatient fifth-wheel trailer
drivers blazed past us, but we soon met them on the way down where they
were nursing their brakes down the switchbacks.  Luckily, a passing lane
appeared and we snuck on past.  There is a waterfall along this route
that is well worth the stop.  It^Òs a good place to take a picnic.

Ranchester, WY
Had to get on I-90 for a bit.  Not fun!  We got to within about 5 miles
of Montana, but something was calling us southward.

Acme, WY
As a devotee of Warner Brothers cartoons, I just _had_ to see what was
in Acme, WY.  To my disappointment, there was nothing but a power plant
(not in operation) and a coal mine (in limited operation).  No massive
factory pumping out gizmos for Wile E. Coyote.  Still, Acme is a very
pretty place with overhanging trees and streams here and there.

Sheridan, WY
&gt;From Sheridan we picked up WY335 and WY193, which parallel the freeway.

Buffalo, WY
Stayed at the Mountain View motel, which had individual cabins with log
interiors.  The local museum is excellent, with two multi-story
buildings full of well-documented memorabilia.  The town was sweltering
at about 105F, so hot that when I crossed the street I left footprints
in the asphalt!  Searching for coolness, we looked for the public pool
and were not disappointed.  The pool was _huge_ (like football-field
size!) and the price was right: free!  We couldn^Òt figure out what a
Wyoming town would do with such a big swimming pool.  Perhaps they use
it for ice skating in the winter.  Leaving Buffalo, we headed south on
WY196, a very pleasant farm road.  We then headed east on WY192.

Kaycee, WY
Sussex, WY
Linch, WY
Pine Tree Jct., WY
Not much to report here.  If you blink you^Òll miss these places.  We
switched to WY387 at the junction.

Wright, WY
Wright is the home of the largest surface coal mine in the world.  The
museum there has a couple of monster mine trucks for the kids to climb
on.  You could easily put four VW buses in the dump bed of each truck. 
Endless rows of identical (and spotless, no graffiti) train cars carried
coal from the mines to the hungry furnaces of America.  We switched to
WY450.

Reno Jct. WY
Clareton, WY
Newcastle, WY
Found a very nice motel a couple of blocks off of the main drag, but the
&quot;No Vacancy&quot; sign was lit.  Went by a few minutes later and it was out. 
Seems that the owner had simply gone to town for a few things! 
Newcastle has an excellent restaurant built into the remains of an old
flour mill.  A nice bit of history there!  We also went to the Dogie
theater (the girls wanted to see &quot;Mulan&quot;)  I^Òm always amazed by the huge
theaters that are still operating in some small towns.  In
pre-television eras, these theaters might sell out on some nights, when
they were the only entertainment in town.  Nowadays, they are lucky to
get a hundred people on the two nights a week they are operating. 
Still, they hang on.  They even have a web site:

&gt;From Newcastle, we headed south on US85.

Mule Creek Jct., WY
And then we headed east on US18
