Subject: Re: [T2] Late model VW electronic ignition questions.

[...]


&gt; I don't know much about which coil is the correct replacement, but last week
&gt; I ordered the bosch &quot;blue coil&quot;, it should be here today or monday.

That blue coil is for standard point ignition only. NOT for 79 and up Calif
version electronic ignition.
If the '78' in your email name means you have a 78 bus, then you would have
point ignition unless you put the VW Calif electronic ignition on it.
