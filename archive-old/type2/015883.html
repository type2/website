&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;Trish tried to back our 72 westy out of the garage this morning and
couldn't budge
&gt;her.  It felt like the emergency brake wasn't releasing, but from the
outside, it
&gt;looked like the back right wheel was the problem--like everything would go
if it was
&gt;released!!
&gt;
&gt;Any ideas on first steps in dealing with this would be greatly appreciated.

Seems like we just talked about this a few weeks ago - you might want to
check the archives for answers to this question.  Basically the drum brake
is stuck.  I've freed mine by simply revving up the motor and dropping the
clutch.  Be tough (but be careful!  Don't break anything).
