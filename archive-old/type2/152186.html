&gt; Just a few notes and long ramblings regarding
&gt; windshield rust repair and glass replacement.
&gt;
&gt; If you can see holes on the inside dash/glass area,
&gt; you will find even more damage under the glass seal.

yes and I know

&gt; The fit and finish of a windshield will not
&gt; tolerate much deviation from the original
&gt; metal/seal shape. It is my experience that the
&gt; frame area will need great care (precision).
&gt; You will need to be better than a passable
&gt; welder to mig in repair metal there.
&gt; I have found better results from sandblasting
&gt; and brazing instead of mig, both for ease of
&gt; repair and for lasting results. Brass doesn't rust.

well I have in the past done a fair amount of brazing, might be worth
considering

&gt; The mig needs a lot of grinding which makes
&gt; adjacent metal thinner, and warpage too.
&gt; Brazing can be remelted and allowed to sag,
&gt; and grinds much easier than steel.

true

&gt; Protect nearby glass from grinder pitting.

thanks

&gt; I would consider donor metal if the whole area
&gt; is shot, but I have never had to resort to it,
&gt; and prefer to labor in many small repair pieces ,

probably a good idea, I just have no idea how much flange is left that is
usable.

&gt; keeping an eye on the original shape.
&gt; The brazing torch is easy on pinholes. Quite pleasant.
&gt; You will have to sandblast the flux off prior to paint.

will need to get a blaster have an air compresson
&gt;
&gt; For all of that mess, weather, and down-time
&gt; you might want to consider the epoxy repairs.
&gt; Fashion repair metal, get the bus warm, and goop it.
&gt;
&gt; Glass shops will not install a windshield
&gt; under 40F ambient temps for good reason.
&gt; You should heed this rule.

for sure
&gt;
&gt; In fact, if you plan to do this whole job
&gt; in any location other than a heated garage,
&gt; for a few days, forget it. It will snow on you.
&gt; Goop the whole exterior seal with clear caulk
&gt; and wait for better weather.

I plan on waiting til spring to do the actual work, rather getting prepped
now and gathering what I may need and practice...

thanks
Bob
