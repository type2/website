&gt; Ok, i will admit, I know very little about Volkwagons as of yet, but I

&gt; What exactly is a 'valve job'

This is the replacement of the valves and sometimes the valve seats. 
For most of us, this translates to &quot;buy new or rebuilt heads&quot;.

, valve adjustment,

This is what you do every few thousand miles (the exact number depends
upon whether you are an &quot;orthodox&quot;, &quot;conservative&quot;, or &quot;reform&quot; VW
owner) to keep from having to do a valve job.  You adjust the
clearance between the rocker arms and valves with adjusting screws
that live under the rocker arm covers which are those sorta
rectangular rounded things that live in the inside rear portion of
your rear wheelwells.  If the clearance becomes too tight you will
damage your valves, if it becomes too loose the engine becomes noisy
and loses power.

 and something about
&gt; 'lapping the valves'

This is the last step in a valve job, where an abrasive paste is
placed between the new valve and seat, then the valve is rotated back
and forth to make the valve and seat match exactly.  Clean off the
abrasive and you now have valves that seal perfectly!
