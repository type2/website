I'd bet on the valves instead.  Have you done the &quot;wet&quot; compression test?
If not, do it.  The procedure is to do one compression test, then put a
couple of squirts of motor oil into the low cylinder and repeat the
compression test in that cylinder.  If the compression increases
substantially (say, 30 psi or more) then it's the rings.  Otherwise, it's
the valves.

&gt;My mechanic is telling me that GEX is bad news in general 

I would agree with him, and I feel for the previous owner.

&gt;and that it's
&gt;possible that there is &quot;something&quot; about the case/cam etc that is
&gt;destroying heads/rings et al.

I doubt that.  Parts is parts, as they say.  The type IV case is pretty
strong and rarely needs anything done to it.  I don't see how GEX could
have messed it up.  Your mechanic should be able to tell you if the cam is
okay.  It bothers me that he won't warranty his work... does he do a lot of
work on aircooled VW's?  My guess is that he is just wary of these engines,
probably having heard they were trouble prone.  

&gt;I'm leaning towards a complete new rebuild for a little peace of mind but I
&gt;really would like to know what it could be in this GEX  case which could
&gt;destroy two engines in less than 7000 miles.

They sell low quality parts and workmanship, simple as that.  But, know
that even buying a &quot;new&quot; rebuilt and having it installed won't guarantee
you anything.  You are still getting a used case and some rebuilt parts -
could be worse than what you have now, especially where cylinder heads are
concerned.  I would find out what's wrong with your current engine before I
decided anything.  If you have a dropped valve seat or burnt exhaust valve
(my guess) then the top end rebuild would probably put you in great shape
since the short block will likely be okay.  The short block is very stout
and even a GEX rebuilt will probably last a while.  In my experience 95% of
all type IV problems are *not* related to the short block.
