Subject: Re: [T2] Heater Box/Accordian Tube cuffs

Hi Karl -

I've also seen these in Black or Orange, but I have never measured them.
Current production of the &quot;cuffs&quot; out of Europe is Grey, 60mm ID x 66mm OD,
with one end flanged at about 75mm, the flange being 10mm thick - overall
length is 28mm.  Although the fiche and the printed parts book doesn't
show/list these separately in the Bay Window Parts List, they appeared years
ago &quot;magically&quot; in the ETKA, T2, Illustration 24-00, Item 15a and we've used
them on a couple of late Bay Windows here at the shop along with several
Ghias.  Could be the 251-255-393B is about the same size as the 111-819-945
currently available (I just remember it from 10 years ago as being bigger on
my Ex 80 Vanagon, but I could be wrong - memory wasn't first thing to go
when the ticker went bad &lt;grin&gt;).

Fresh Air Heater Boxes (1500/1600) from 68 (Type 1 &amp; Type 2) onwards are
60mm pipes on the HB flappers and after checking the Bay and Vanagon Flapper
Boxes, they are of course 60mm as well.  I also fitted the 111-819-945
&quot;cuff&quot; onto them - nice and snug fit.

The earlier Fresh Air Heater Boxes are 50mm outlets.

Thanks for your input on this.

&gt; Well.... the rubber sleeves replace tin w/asbestos sleeves on a bay
&gt; perfectly.
&gt;
&gt; Here is a picture of a bay flapper valve with the original sleeve:

&gt;
&gt; Here is a bay flapper with the 251 255 393B on it, same 60mm size. B is
&gt; 1st version black, D is 2nd version
&gt; orange:

&gt;
&gt; Here is a type 1 heater box. It has a 60mm end, same as the flapper
&gt; valves, same as Vanagon ends, same as the
&gt; sleeves. [Early type 1 heater boxes were smaller, if I remember right
&gt; 40mm? Someone used to make oddball
&gt; accordian tubes for spilt buses that were large on one end and small on
&gt; the other for people putting in
&gt; mis-match sizes]

&gt;
&gt; And here is all the pieces as a group:

&gt;
&gt; And I about 8 of the black ones.......
