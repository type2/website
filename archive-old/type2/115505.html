Subject: Re: [T2] Antenna replacement

If you reach up under there, there are two
bolts that come through with a 17mm and an 11mm
nut on them. 
The antennae were installed by the dealer
and were put in different places sometimes opposite sides.
I got mine out but it was a PITA because the nuts were seized.
The new one looks great from wolfsburg.
good luck.  The antenna came with a new cable.

Our 1978 bus has a broken antenna and a broken antenna cable.  The 
antenna has a black base that seems to be mounted with two studs which I 
can not see.  It would be a simple matter to replace the antenna poll
