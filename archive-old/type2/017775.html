&gt; Wilson's book says to start it up, put it up to 2,000 rpm, and leave it
&gt; there for 20 minutes.  Then change the oil.
&gt; 
&gt; It's hard to do becuse the engine is usually LOUD and smoky, and your
&gt; heart's in your throat (at least mine was.)  I'd recommend standing at
&gt; the engine compartment and holding the throttle open with your hand.
&gt; That way you can scan for any problems, like leaking fuel lines.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck.

John and Tom:
You really ought to get a copy of Hoover's &quot;Sermons&quot;!
He does quite a masterful job of laying out what to do in these critical
first minutes of your engines new life. Too much for me to reiterate
after a long day. And besides, he deserves the royalties after paying
dues so many years. This guy has built VW aircraft engines. That's where
reliability takes on a whole new meaning.
