Subject: Re: [T2] ** Valve adj. problem for 1.7 engine **

Would it make a difference if I had said the engine hadnt been run in about 
10 years? The previous owner had said he couldnt get it running right, so 
thats why he gave up. The engine has dual Dollortos(sp) 40's. There was some 
sort of nasty looking thick rubber gasket between the carb and intake. Kinda 
thought thats why it might not have run right.

&gt; &gt; I have a friend that bought a Porsche 914 with a 1700 engine  and is 
&gt;trying
&gt; &gt; to adjust the valves (talk about a pain to get to).  He just emailed me
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; problem.  When I got to 3 I had a problem.  When I back out the
&gt; &gt; adjusting
&gt; &gt; screw the piston/spring followed.  No way to slip a feeler gauge in as
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; space kept collapsing. So, I doing something wrong or is the engine
&gt; &gt; busted?  Any ideas?&quot;
&gt;
&gt;probably broken valve.  minimum it is pulling the head, possible rebuild
&gt;time if the valve went through the piston.
