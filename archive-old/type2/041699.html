 What's up? I'm having a problem putting my 68 bus into certain gears.It
all started when we had this heat wave, and it only seems to be hard to
find 2 gear.It doesn't grind at all it's just I have to muscle it
sometimes.Any pointers, will be appreciated, I'm gonna look tommorow but
I don't know where I should start.
Thanks,
Casey
68 Westy
