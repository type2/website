Subject: Re: [T2] Re-tap a spark plug?

    Prices are going to vary depending on your location. But it should not
cost over &quot;one hours&quot; labor rate, plus parts.
    Say the shop labor rate is - $50.00 per hour, spark plug, spark plug
insert, Heli-Coil, etc $5.00, plus tax, etc. Maybe a total of $50.00 to
$75.00 per.
    If properly installed it should last for years. Be sure and use
Anti-size on the threads of new plugs.

Subject: [T2] Re-tap a spark plug?


&gt; Howdy,
&gt;
&gt; How much should it cost to re-tap a spark plug? Is it a problem that
should
&gt; dissaude me from buying this bus, i.e. will it cause worse performance on
an
&gt; extended road trip?
