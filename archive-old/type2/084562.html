Subject: Re: [T2] Is the starter for an 091 different than a 3 rib?

I agree with everything Steve said about parts swapping, but if you had the 
091 trans in your bus and if it was running and starting properly, then my 
guess is that you should be able to use the 73 tranny if you get the 
starter that goes with it.  The bellhousings are indeed different.  I 
haven't done this swap either though, so no guarantees.

&gt;I replaced the 091 6 rib trans in my bus tonight with a 3 rib unit from a 
&gt;73.  The only thing that didn't jive was the starter.  It has a collar on 
&gt;the starter shaft that is intefering with the bellhousing causing it not 
&gt;to bolt up.  The two bellhousings do look different and I am wondering if 
&gt;I need to change the starter to an earlier model.  The bus is a 1971.
&gt;Any advice would be greatly appreciated
