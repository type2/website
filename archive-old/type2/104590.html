Subject: Insurance help.

Hi everyone,

      I have a problem. On april 1st my Bus has to go on the road because 
the insurance runs out on my other car.   I've been looking for a new 
insurance company because of the way they handled my sisters car accident. 
I.ve been looking  for about a week now and i can't find anyone that will 
insure a car thats over 20 years old (i think its my age (17) and the age of 
the car).  I live in Ontario so if anyone from here knows of a good company 
please tell me... I think i'm going to put classic insurance on it if that 
helps.  And yes i know since i'm 17 i'm going to get screwed with high 
insurance.  Thanks for the help everyone.

Adam
&quot;Enjoy and take care of your Volkswagen she maybe the only one you'll ever 
get.&quot;
