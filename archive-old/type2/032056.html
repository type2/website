 	I have this same problem on my 79 Westy.  I replaced all the
rubber seals, put weatherstrip on the inside lip were the luggage rack
meets the rear portion of the poptop and I still have air coming in.
Finally in a desperate attempt to keep warm here in New Hampshire I put
white duck tape across the outside upper joint between the luggage rack
and rear section (beleive me you get desperste when 0 degree air is
blowing on your head all the time) and I still have air coming in.  It is
much less now but still enough to puff out the canvas after being on the
road for 15 minutes, and still enough to make it hard to heat.  I now have
no clue where this air could be coming in from.  Help Please! TIA
