&gt; Several months ago I bought a Gene Berg swivel screw (&quot;elephant foot&quot;)
&gt; valve adjuster kit for the Wonderbus. Didn't install the kit because
&gt; that engine blew up. I purchased a replacement 1600 DP engine in Mexico
&gt; and put it in the Wonderbus and it has been peachy ever since. Today I
&gt; got around to pulling the rocker assemblies off the new engine with an
&gt; eye toward installing the swivel foots and discovered that the newer
&gt; rocker arms take M10 adjusting screws. But the GB kit is set up for
&gt; rockers with M8 thread.

I'm no Type 1 expert but don't those mexican blocks have 9mm rocker arms.

&gt; &quot;Seeking a set of good-quality factory stock-ratio rocker arms that take
&gt; the M8 adjusting screw that are either new or in wonderful condition.&quot;

I seem to recall &quot;elephant foot&quot; adjusters that come in a 9mm version?
