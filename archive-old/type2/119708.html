Subject: Re: Brazilian Master Cylinder (Fie!)

OK, so I've got the MC off and am ready to install the German-made
(NOS) MC...I lost one of the brake lines to corrosion...The threaded
end lost its 11 mm head even with a tubing wrench....What's the
consensus on a &quot;brake safe&quot; anti-seize compound so's I don't have
the same problem again...?
