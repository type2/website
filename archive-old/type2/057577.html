Subject: Magic Bus did us proud!

Well, the &quot;Magic&quot;bus (72 non-westy) took us 11,628 miles (not Kilometres) in
58 days,
from British Columbia to Newfoundland and back and never missed a beat!
(hesitations
and flat spots attributed to a progressive Weber don't count)

We averaged 24 mpg (Canadian gallons eh?) and checked/adjusted the tappet
clearence 5
times, changed oil/filter 3 times, points and condensor twice and adjusted
the Weber
9,000 times.

We were passed by most people in North America at least once, some as many
as 3 or 4
times in one day.  Anyone notice that its the same people that pass you over
and over
again on a long trip, especially on major highways leading to specific
destinations?
Don't these people learn that it doesn't pay to go faster than 90 KM (that's
55 mph for
our southern friends)?

We rushed across from June 12th to get to Newfoundland as soon as possible
to see the
ice-bergs (FANTASTIC!!!) and set our front wheels on their shores on the
morning of the
9th day.  Only stopped once in Northern Ontario for an extra day after a
particularily
gruelling 12 hour drive the day before.

Stayed in Newfoundland for 3 weeks and met a couple of great VW Van folks
including a
young couple (he says he's a &quot;lurker&quot; here, so now you have my e-mail
address so write,
why don't you?) just north of Port Aux Basques at a gas station.  We pulled
up to this
van the same colour as ours (green/white) and parked beside them.  You
understand there
are not a lot of VW Vans in Newfoundland (something to do with the winters I
think).
Saw another one zipping along the highway, flourescent green, lowered ect.
with a Kayak
on top.

We took a month to poke our way back, enjoying Southern New Brunswick
immensly and the
only new rattles the &quot;Magic&quot;bus picked up was some baffle or something in
the muffler
that rattles at specific rpm's.  Sounds kind of neat.

Ifn I had a nickel for everyone that said &quot;you drove all the way to here in
THAT!&quot;, I'd
be able to buy a new pop top for her.
