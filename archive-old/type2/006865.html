Boy I sure wouldn't want 50 psi in my front tires -- talk about
squirrley -- and unsafe. I never put more than 29 psi (VW recommended
even on full load) The front is so much lighter than the rear. The rear
vary, again by recommendation, 39 psi, 42 psi fully loaded. This is on a
'71 Hardtop Westy. I'm running out the door right now but I have
documentation of a '71 Westy's (w/pop top) weight at less than 3700 lbs
-- wet. Max load about 5000.

My $.02,

Scott

Leo,

I'll bet you come closer to 6k lbs than you think.  A Westy is heavier
than my
ASI Riviera, and I drive across ODOT's scales every now and then.  Empty
water
tank, no food, a minimum of gear, one human, no dog, half a tank of
fuel, full
propane tank crosses at 4900 lbs.  Add a couple of humans, food, dog,
full
tanks and the usual assortment of sundry items and I'll bet it's over
the 6k
limit.  Go with the &quot;D&quot; rated tyres if you can afford them.  I run
LT27/8.50-14 &quot;D&quot; rated tyres at 50# all the way around.  Just air down
when I
get on washboard roads.

&gt; Hello again!
&gt; 
&gt; First of all, thank you to those of you who responded to my original
post.
&gt; I've narrowed down my search to 3 tires.  Because I want to stick with
&gt; 185R14 size tires (I don't want to subsitute them with 195/75R14
tires), I
&gt; find that I'm sort of limited to what's available out there.  By the
way, I
&gt; think I'm safe to get C load range tires (vs. D).  C load range tires
(in
&gt; 185R14 size) should be sufficient to handle up to a 6000 lb. load.  I
don't
&gt; think I'll be loading up my 71' westy to make it exceed 6000 lbs.   So
here
&gt; are the tires that I'm looking at (all are availalble at Tire Rack):
