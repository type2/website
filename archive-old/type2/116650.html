Subject: My 64 Bug is Dead

Sorry to trouble you folks but since I do have a bus I am going to post this 
question.

An errant driver running a red light has totaled my fully restored 1964 
sunroof bug. This was my practice car for my 62 15-window restoration with 
much credit due to Thom and several other list members for their patient 
advice on painting and related topics. The good news is that my daughter was 
well protected by the car and came away with a mild concusion and some 
bruises albeit thoroughly shookup. You could say the bug died protecting 
her. Anyway, both door posts have been pushed and the entire body is torqued 
so, in my opinion, the core of the car is dead.

I am in the San Francisco bay area and am looking for a good bug body that I 
can use the parts from my 64 in. I would strongly prefer a 1961-63 ragtop 
since I am a complete fresh air fiend.  If it is within a reasonable 
distance, a few hours or so, and can be towed with a bar I can retrieve it. 
Alternatively, if someone can refer me to someone or someplace that may have 
such a car I would appreciate it.

I would also prefer something affordably priced since I am currently out of 
work (anyone looking for a coldfusion programmer?)

Thanks for listening.
