Subject: [T2] Sharp turn noise

I am recently new to this list, and recently purchased a sweet 83 Westy.
All is well, except that ive noticed an occaisonal loud high pitched sound
coming from what i think is passenger side rear of vehicle, when i make
SHARP turns to the right.
Anybody have an idea to what this might be?  Have i over cranked the wheel
past some point that it doesn't like? Or is trouble lurking???

                          Thanks for any help:-)
