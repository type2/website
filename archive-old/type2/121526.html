Subject: Re: [T2] Low-mileage heads: to rebuild or not to rebuild?

Check 'em for guide slop, valve length, etc then install and put them to work.

I've had GREAT results with used parts. Just make sure they are clean.

I am R&amp;R'ing a Corvair 110 HP for my bus. Took it down to the long block 
and cleaned, cleaned, cleaned and threw new seals and paint at it and I 
hope this will work well. I did this for several cars over the years with 
excellent results.
