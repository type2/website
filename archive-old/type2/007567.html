Regarding Michelin quality ....

Where I work we test wheels under very high load and mileage conditions to test
their durability.

In order to test these wheels we must use tires, since we must simulate the
loads that tires place on wheels running down the road.

Our experience has been, Michelin tires last several times longer than any
other brand under these high load conditions.  Up to 10 times longer than the
other major brands.

Because of the nature of these tests, the tread is not worn.  However, these
tires do experience extreme fatigue.  After all, we are trying to fatigue
wheels.

My 20 years experience in the tire/wheel industry has been that Michelin
quality is unbeatable.  This quality does come at a price.

If price is a consideration, look at Yokohama and Dunlop tires.

If safety outweighs price, go with Michelin.
