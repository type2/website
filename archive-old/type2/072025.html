Subject: removing window lifter mechanism
Message-Id: &lt;l03130300b3999d0a8c2c_at_[206.163.180.73]&gt;

kind vfolks;

i am trying to remove my driver's side window lifter mechanism. the window
lifter cable bracket has come apart from the lifter channel. it doesn't
look as if it was riveted, just sorta pinched in 4-5 places. so i am
guessing welding or replacement...

removal is challenging.  i am unable to slip the lifter cable past the
front guide channel. i removed the screw that holds the front guide channel
to the door, but the bracket doesn't disengage from the door. thus, i am
hung up there.

sooooo close. any ideas on getting past that front channel guide?
also, the window lifter channel (attched tightly to the bottom of the
window) is looking like a bear to pull off. is it a safe bet to use wood
and hammer to pop it off?

another item - the outside rubber scraper looks a little chewed, and i am
wondering if anybody has replaced that; if the riveting that looks to be
involved is problematic/do-able.

thanks one and all, steve
