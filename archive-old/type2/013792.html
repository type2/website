Howdy, 
There is something strange that I noticed around my
town... I know of four baywindows in Crossville, TN,
three of which are owned by drummers, including
myself. Another drummer I know is also planning on
buying one, making four out of five owned by drummers.
Does this strange phenomenon occur
elsewhere? I consider myself a fairly accomplished
drummer, having received a sizely scholership from
Tennessee Tech's music department beginning this fall.
One of the other baywindows is owned by a VERY
accomplished drummer... Are any other bus
owner/drummers out there? What is it that draws
drummers to Volkswagens?
                                  Thanks,
                                  Paul Deatherage
