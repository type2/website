Subject: Can anyone send me digital pics of a Bus?
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

HI gang!

I posted this a while back but never got any e-mail responses.
I am converting my once Corvair powered truck back to VW and need some help.  
If anyone can e-mail me digital pictures of the complete underside of their 
1968-1971 bus I would appreciate it.  I am not sure what is right and what is 
wrong with my truck. I do have some problems worked out but without access to 
another bus to look at I am not 100% sure.  I will try to get some digital 
pics of the truck's underside. Maybe then you guys could tell me what is 
right and wrong.
Thanks
Dave
