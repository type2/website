Subject: completely hosed by complete follow up

thanks for all the replies - oddly, complete auto had been highly 
recommended by some ch*vy truck folks i was involved with, and they 
did a fine job BRINGING the stuff out here.  whether the guy who quit 
screwed up his contracts, or they blew em off, they should have 
admitted the fault.  talking to me monday about the job and then 
denying, thursday, that you've ever heard about it is just 
ridiculous. plus, he'd JUST mentioned the trck would be out after the 
16th.  there's a simpson's where milhouse claims bart killed his 
goldfish, and then denied milhouse HAD a goldfish. 'then why did i 
have the BOWL, bart... why did i have the bowl????'

i thought about buying a trailer, but i really have no use for it. 
rental is fine, once they found one.  and they agreed to let me drop 
it off in texas, rather than take it to pittsburgh (where i am going 
for my first stop).
now all i have to do is NOT die in a fiery three-car crash due to a 
loose trailer  like the one my mother just saw on the news yesterday 
:)
