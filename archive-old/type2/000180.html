Well, unfortunately I just had to replace my seals to because of excess  
leaks and drips( boy what a mess!)  I RTV'd them in place and they still leak 
a little.  Now the big problem I have a 80 engine in my 74 westy and This 
morning after cranking a running around town with fellow list member Paul I 
think my valves are tapping.  I didn't do a valve adjust because I just took 
the rockers off and didn't mess with the adjustment of them.  Me question is 
how long does it take for the rods to prime themselves? Right now it sounds 
like it is knocking around the covers. I ASSumed that is just the pushrods am 
I right?  So I need a valve adjust? Thanx all!!!
