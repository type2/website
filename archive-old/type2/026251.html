Subject: update FI '77: what kind of kharma is this?
Message-ID: &lt;BEGDEFOPKMOJCAAA_at_theglobe_dot_com&gt;

Throughout my life, I have attained the impossible...the possible gives me more trouble. I knew I would never work for IBM; I did. I knew I would never get a book published; I published 2 with Random House. I knew I'd never find the perfect woman for me; I did. I knew I'd never get a Masters' degree, but I graduated from UA with a 4.0. All of this, of course, occurred with the help of others.

Now, once I decided to give up on the FI, knowing I would never get this bus to run with it, I fiddled with a couple wires and viola--it runs! It runs rich and has an exhaust leak where one of the heat exchangers is supposed to seal to the head, but it runs. To be honest, I wouldn't have tried again without the suggestions from listees.

I'm not exactly sure which thing I did solved the problem. This, of course, is not good because the problem may return. On the positive side, I do have some reference points:

1. I checked the ground wires, then removed the ballast resistor plug and put a lead into the main power supply and one into ground on a test light to see if I was getting a flickering light.
The light went solid as soon as I turned the key on. She started as usual; then stalled.

2. I decided maybe I wasn't checking the right place, so I pulled an injector lead and hooked my test light up there. I got nothing when I turned the key, but I realized I had left the ballast resistor plug unplugged.

3. I plugged the ballast resistor back in and started the bus. To my amazement, she started and stayed running. I let her run for about 30 seconds, which indicates to me that she's not going to stall. I could even hit the gas, which I'd not been able to do previously without stalling. The light on the injector seemed to be solid, but it did get dimmer and brighter with changes in RPM...more RPM=brighter.

4. I went back and disconnected the test leads and plugged the injector lead back in; then fired her up again and she continued to run.

My guess is that, as a couple folks suggested, my problem is not with my FI components, but rather in the wiring somewhere. My guess now is that I've got everything wired correctly, but some wiring is damaged in the harness at the ballast resistor connection or at the lead to the #3 injector plug (which is the one I disconnected and then plugged in).

As for the exhaust leak, I'm going to see how some VERY HIGH TEMP silicone works on this. I've tried filing the rough spots out of the heat exchanger connection to the head, but that hasn't worked. I'm pretty sure that there's some warpage or other damage either on the head or heat exchanger that's causing the sealing surface/mating surface not to match up properly. If I can find RTV that will survive head temps, I think this may cure the problem. Ultimately, I'll probably be looking for another passenger side heat exchanger, but for now I'm happy to try some shortcuts to get the bus on the road and get some transportation after over a month of bumming rides and thinking about taking on car payments.

Thanks! Joe
