&gt; &gt; Hi list
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I just removed the auxiliary aire regulator (valve?) from my 78 EFI.
&gt; &gt; There is a small rubber elbow attached to it, about half an inch in
&gt; &gt; diameter.

I have been looking for this for several weeks as mine is taped and still
holding together. Bus Depot didn't have it in stock on my last order. If
anyone finds a source please let the list know.
