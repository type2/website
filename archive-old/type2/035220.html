&lt;&lt; On the Jeep thing, please let that die, I really don't need a VW vs. Jeep
 thread starting, everyone on this list knows what is better so you'd all be
 preaching to the choir anyway ;-)

I never intended to cause any sort of 'j**p vs. VW debate.  You could've 
substituted most any later model vehicle for j**p.
I was just voicing my opinion, (and there was a note for the extremely VW 
faithful to skip it.)
&gt;From now on I'll just sit on my hands and read.
One last note, though.
I've always owned at least one VW since I bought my first at 14 years old, 
and I've got more now than ever.  I sincerely like them and didn't intend to 
flame them.
