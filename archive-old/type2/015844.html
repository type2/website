&gt;True... but can you purchase new cases, heads, etc...

AFAIK, you cannot buy a new type IV case whereas you can buy a new type I
case.  There is a reason for this!  The reason is that there is no demand
for new type IV cases because the old ones don't wear out.  There IS a
demand for a new type I case because they DO wear out.  It's like you're
saying, &quot;Your rechargeable NiCd batteries are nice, but I like the
throw-away alkalines because you can buy replacements&quot;.  That's a little
extreme but you get my point.  :)  With the exception of the case, I do
believe you can get all type IV parts new, even heads if you look hard enough.
