ps i'll have some pictures soon of the restoration job. it was done by rick
mock in bellflower, ca. the body looks like a gleaming refrigerator (the
bears get excited when they see us pull into the campground). the inside
needs some more work. the original white plastic (?) trim around the veneer
cabinets shrunk. in its last life, the bus did  a lot of traveling in the
desert and lived outside in Reno. the trim sort of shriveled up and is now
about 1 - 2 inches shorter than it should be. any ideas for replacement?
