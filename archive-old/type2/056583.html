Subject: 73' Bus For Sale......

It hurts to say this but, my 73 air cooled Bus is for sale.  Thanks to the
military and Not being able to ship the bus to hawaii I am forced to sell
it.
I am asking $2000.00/OBO. The interior has been replaced and the engine was
rebuilt by a BMW mechanic 11 days prior to my purchase.

Any one interested please contact me at: veedubbus_at_email.msn_dot_com

I live in Norfolk, VA and you can call anytime. I have to sell it prior to
middle of Sept.  You can call at (757) 423-3798.  Please only die hard vee
dub inquirees.......

Have a VEEDUB day.........

Ken
