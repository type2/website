Subject: RE: [T2] green wire on voltage regulator

Tom,

the green wire from your regulator should be coming off the DF terminal and
go to the DF terminal on your alternator.

Subject: [T2] green wire on voltage regulator


i asked this ? yesterday with no response, so I thought I would ask one more
time.  I have a green wire coming off my bosch VR in my 73 bus.  It is about
4 inches long and has a female connector on it.  It is not hooked up to
anything.  Does anyone have any idea where this wire should go?  My bentley
arrives today, so maybe I won't need to ask as many ?'s in the future.

Thanks again for eveybodies help.
