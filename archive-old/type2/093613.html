&gt;Well, after driving my '81 Vanagon all these years I....

&gt;finally broke down and bought an '82 Westy!  I though the supplemental

&gt;the Vanagon manual.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, I seem to recall that these manuals were being re-published by some
&gt;outfit, but I don't know who.  Can anybody point me in the right direction?

I have no idea which is closer to an 81 model, 80 or 83 but these are available,new, from Robert Bentley:
