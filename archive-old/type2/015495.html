Hope all you want, Doyt. Then try whatever juris rigus is suggested. Then
have another failure. Then right off the wasted time/money and pull the
head and hope that now after the extra rigus going on the machinist can
save it so you don't have to by a new head or take a risk with a used one,
and either will have to be checked for match with the other head to confirm
stock cc balance so it must be pulled as well.
