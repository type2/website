Subject: New Exhaust Gaskets-Advice?

Ok, I got my new/used exhaust on the 77 bus finally, but I noticed that my manifold tubes are old, are slightly 'concave' between the 3 bolts in the triangle connections.  I was hoping to just tighten the bolts and close that gap, but it didn't seem to work.  I am using new gaskets that are metallic with the little holes in them.

My question is will these gaskets heat up and seal the gap in time, or can I add another gasket (2 total)?  The leak isn't much, but is noticable.  What are your experiences in fixing gasket leaks?  Thanks in advance for your advice gang.

Mike
