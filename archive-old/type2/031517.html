&gt; On the good side, the bus drives great, and the interior is in very good

rattle can is better than MAACO

&gt; paint job,etc. It just kills me to do stuff half ass, but I don't want to
&gt; put lots of money into it and then receive orders to go overseas(I'm in the
&gt; Army) and end up having to sell it. What do you guys think? any comments,
&gt; suggestions will be appreciated. Best regards

do the job and take it with you,  I lucked out and got sent to Germany,
shipped a VW to Germany????,  brought it back too
