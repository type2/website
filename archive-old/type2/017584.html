Subject: Westy 110v to 12 v converter problems
Message-ID: &lt;3709602E.3C20_at_erols_dot_com&gt;

Hi Volks......Here's the situation.  I have a '79 westy and the
converter that recharges my second battery (when I'm hooked up to &quot;shore
power&quot;) doesn't seem to be working.  Also, the refrig doesn't work when
I'm connected to 110v power UNLESS the timer (used only when recharging
the 2nd battery) is turned on.  So.....what's up with that?
Is the converter on the fritz?  

I pulled off the panel for the frig controls and all seems in
order....but where exactly is the 110 to 12v converter located?

All help is, of course, greatly appreciated!
