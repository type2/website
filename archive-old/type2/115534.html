Subject: 3 fuse box relays?

I have a third relay on my fuse box. It is smaller than the one for the 
dimmer and the one for the turnsignals/flashers. It is located on the 
passenger side of the fuse box. It appears to be one space over from the 
end. Out of this relay comes a gray wire and a gray wire with a black 
stripe. One of the wires goes up into a big sheathed bundle. The other is 
attached to the relay, but not at the other end.
Does any one know what this relay is for and where the other end of the wire 
should go.
Thanks,
Kyle
