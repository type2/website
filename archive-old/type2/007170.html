I having a problem tuning my beast.  It seems my adjustments to the carb
are having little effect.  As I adjust both mixture and air there is
little change in engine speed.  I changed out the 009 to a vacuum
advance to improve idle and the lower rpm range.  My points are right on
but I'm not sure on the timing setting.  
It's a 1600 dual port, letter code AK, runnning a new 34pict.  Recently
rebuilt with 41 heads and a mild cam.  I know the cam wasn't the
brightest of ideas but It was left over from my bug and I figured &quot;what
the heck&quot;.  Anyway too late to change it.
What effects timing?  Is it the engine year, distributor, or cam?  I've
tried it at 5 btdc and 5 atdc.  I'm thinking maybe a small vacuum leak
in the brake booster line since the brakes seem less effective or just a
timing thing.
Any takers?
