Subject: [T2] fuel gauge replacement

I went out to replace my fuel gauge sending unit this afternoon. I removed 
the firewall and can see the unit, but the rear of the gas tank has a mound 
that gives about an inch and a half between it and the body. Before I tried 
to tackle this I looked in the bentley and the shape of the gas tank they 
showed was different. My bus had california emissions,  so it has two metal 
pipes coming from the tank and running across this mound, any ideas how to 
get this thing replaced? If I must remove the tank, what does that involve? 
I read the article in the library and it sounded do-able, please help!
