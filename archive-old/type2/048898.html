Subject: [T2] Rusty tank:

Sean,

    Almost any auto repair shop should be able to do the work for you. Save
the labor and pull it yourself. Bring the acid, and tank sealer with you and
shop around for the best deal.
    Unless you find a used tank close enought for you to go get, you will
have a hard time getting a used one shipped, EPA and all.
    It really isn't a hard job. Think of a jar with paint in it, you shake
it untill the insides are totally covered. This is basicly what you will do,
place about a gal at a time of acid in the tank, tilt, roll, shake the tank
untill all of the rust is disolved. (you can look in and see it work, DON'T
BREATH THE FUMES) Nuteralize the acid with water, and then acetone, blow dry
out. It will start to rust right away, so get the sealer in ASAP! Do the
same with the sealer, shake, roll, tilt, etc. You can do this, pulling the
tank is harder and more work. You just have to very careful with the acid.
Take the used acid to a waste oil disposal.
    Let us know how it comes out.
