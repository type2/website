Subject: RE: [T2] The ramifications of high crankcase pressure

&gt;From: &quot;Mike's Bus&quot;

&gt;I have this same oil leak all though not as bad (I probably go through an
&gt;extra quart per 1000 miles) but all the same symptoms/oil locations Gregg
&gt;mentioned.


&gt;So what else could/would cause this high crank case pressure thing??????


I have a question for both of you and the list. Could this have anything to 
do with the oil pressure relief valve? Have either of you checked it out? Or 
could this even be a possibility?
