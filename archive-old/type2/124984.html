Subject: Re: [T2] Thanksgiving Misgivings 1

Hey Kevin,

Thanksgiving Misgiving's used to be a Full Moon member only campout 
(although all were really invited it was only advertised on Full Moon).

It got too expensive for Mad Uncle Dave to host (and he was tied in with 
Oktoberbus too) so it was canceled last year. I threw together the campout 
last year, one week before the date and started doing it in SC. However my 
work load has overwhelmed me and Dixie and Sarah want to host it this year. 
It should be a pretty nice turnout, but don't expect to see a sea of buses 
like you would find at High Country. Last year we had about 20 buses show 
up, which was pretty good for one week's notice.

Oktoberbus will draw more, mabye 40-80 buses (you never can tell).

If you really want to see a sea of buses I would start making plans to 
attend some of the more popular campouts next year. Everybus, High Country, 
NaturalBus, Buses on the River. I know they are a year away now but they 
will draw a lot more buses in general. I know you want to see a lot of buses 
at once, but some of the smaller campouts are a lot of fun because they are 
more personal and you get real close with your neighbors. Thanksgiving, 
Oktoberbus, New Year's Resolution and Paddy's Wagens are in the cooler 
weather and Sunshine Daydream, Fire on the Mountain and more are next year 
when it's warmer.

Good luck and welcome ot Full Moon,

Rob Henley
Moonie for 5 years now!
