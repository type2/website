Subject: [T2] Back home to Wolfsburg

I can't see that it would be any different from any other European city
becuase bay buses were not made in Wolfsburg in the first place. The were
made in Hanover. In fact even splitties were made in Hanover since 1956.


&gt;As part of my upcoming trip round Europe, I'm planning on passing through 
&gt;Wolfsburg.  Does anyone know if I can get my van serviced by a T2
specialist 
&gt;there?  I can't help thinking that the whole town will be full of seasoned 
&gt;mechanics.
