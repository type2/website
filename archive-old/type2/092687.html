&gt;I am finally getting around to installing the guages I bought for my 74, and

&gt;good place for those pods to go. I originally bought the pods because I also
&gt;have never been a fan of hanging the guages below the dash. So, how have
&gt;others solved the mounting problem? I have four guages: oil pressure, oil
&gt;temp, head temp, and volts. Any suggestions are gratefully accepted and
&gt;pictures, if available, would be a plus!

Here's what I did:

You will have to cut the dash though.  If your radio hole is already 
mangled, that might not be an issue.  You could fit your four gauges, plus 
two more (I recommend vacuum and a second head temp gauge for the other head!).
