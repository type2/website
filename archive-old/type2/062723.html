&gt;Hey Volks,
&gt;        Well, I talked the PO of that '74 Campmobile, and from what he tells
&gt;me, the rear main seal needs replacing, and since the clutch is slipping due
&gt;to the oil splashing from the bad seal, it will need replacing too(?)  Am I
&gt;right in assuming that no amount of cleaning will remove this oil and return
&gt;the clutch to usable condition?

Yes, you're right.  Buy a new clutch disc, but don't feel you have to
replace the pressure plate and throwout bearing if they were working fine
before.  I'm sure someone will probably reply telling you to ALWAYS replace
these parts, but my opinion is that it's a waste of money.

p.s. My opinion is worth every penny you paid for it.
