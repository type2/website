&gt; I did the under floor spare in my 65 Westy many years ago.  getting it out

&gt; affected things.

Some Japanese pickups had a nifty device that extended a cable or chain
down from a tiny winch.  You hooked the chain/cable to the center hole of
the wheel and winched the thing up with the jack crank until it contacted
the bottom of the car.

That would work a treat for an under-bus tire stowage arangement.
