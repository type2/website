&gt; Hi All:
&gt; I am in the process of changing my registration/title back to California
&gt; from Pennsylvania.  The problem I ran into was that DMV wanted to identify
&gt; the VIN No in two locations.  The one at the windshield was readable since
&gt; it is pressed into metal  The decal label don the drivers side door entrance
&gt; is damaged so you cannot read all the numbers.
&gt;
&gt; DMV said I had to make an appointment with the CA Highway Patrol since there
&gt; are hidden location they know about in the event a vehicle is stolen.  I was
&gt; given a temporary permit for thirty days.
&gt;
&gt; Do any of you know where these numbers are placed on the vehicles.  I have
&gt; the VW mechanics manual but it only identifies the windshield VIN location
&gt; and the engine id number location.
&gt;
my 78 has the number stamped into the metal in the engine compartment,
left side, front on the flange that the foam seal fits onto, just below
the coil
