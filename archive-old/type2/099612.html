Subject: Re: [T2] Wont start at all now...

As a former Navy Electrician's Mate and the departmental battery &quot;mate&quot; I 
have seen another cause you need to investigate. You may know this, you may 
not. FWIW here it is.

I have seen a few batteries that had visually &quot;clean&quot; connections but were 
corroded between the battery cable and clamp or clamp and battery post. 
Under low load the connection would work fine but under high load 
(starting) the connection would fail and give symptoms of a dead battery 
(clicking starter) despite the fact that the other accessories would work.

One temporary &quot;emergency&quot; type solution would be to jam a flat blade 
screwdriver between the cable clamp and the battery post. That won't 
substitute long term though for a proper cleaning.

Disassemble the battery and cables. Pull the battery, remove the cable from 
the battery, remove the cable from the clamp and remove the cable from the 
starter. Make a milkshake consistency mix out of baking soda and water. 
Coat everything with a brush. Scrub it around. Rinse with water. Don't 
forget to do the battery tray too. Now either use the handy dandy battery 
and terminal cleaner (phallic looking little wire brush doo-hickie). The 
bottom is a female brush for the battery post, the top is a male brush for 
cleaning the battery clamp. You can do the same job with a pocketknife - 
scraping off the top layer.

Assemble and coat with vasoline or spray with the red protection liquid 
that most FLAPS sell. Will protect and inhibit new corrosion.
