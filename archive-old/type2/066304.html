Subject: Re: Buying Questions

&gt;My question is that I have found a '77 Westi with a complete motor and
&gt;interior, but the engine is locked up. It looks good on the outside and
&gt;there is no oil on the ground. The body is in perfect health. Is it
&gt;possible to rebuild a lock T4 and be able to bet miles out of it. The PO
&gt;wants &lt;$500&gt; for the whole thing, including locked motor
&gt;
Frankly, if you don't buy it for $500, please give me the guy's number and 
I'll buy it. Seriously.
If by &quot;perfect health&quot; you mean that the body is solid and straight, it is 
worth that much with no motor at all.  Even if the motor in the Westy is to 
far gone to rebuild, finding a rebuildable short block should be fairly 
easy.  (I've got several of 'em.)  The body and interior alone are worth 
the asking price.
