Subject: Need Throttle Body

Hello All,

In doing some work on my bus I have discovered that my throttle body 
needs to be replaced. My local shop does not have one.
I have searched the vendors on our list (on line catalogs) as well to no 
avail.

If anyone has a lead on a throttle body for a 1976 FI bus, I would 
appreciate it.

There are a couple on the Samba for water cooled, but I don't know if 
they are an acceptable replacement or not.
Any advice will be appreciated.

Thanks.
