&gt; Well, I'm back.

Hey! ;) I was wondering what was taking you so long. I drove up your
street and spotted two houses it could have been, but no U-Haul apparatus,
so I figured you were just ambling along.

&gt; I was surprised to find that there's a smog inspection here in Memphis.

Not worth worrying about.

(1) If you have the Bartlett zip code (I think you do) then take your
utility bill and pretend you live in Bartlett, which has no inspection.

(2) A 67 could not possibly fail smog unless it has serious blowby. They
only measure at idle, so if necessary you lean out your idle for a few
minutes. VW thoughtfully made this very easy on the 34-PICT3.

(3) They check for headlights, brake lights and parking lights and (for
some reason) high beams. They check the parking brake but not the brakes
(phased that out last year). They check the VID at inspection, not
registration, so figure out where it is before you go because I guarantee
the simians at the testing station won't know where to look.

Don't worry about it, it's a laughable test.

Welcome home! ;)
