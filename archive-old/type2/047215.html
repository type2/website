Subject: [T2] Clutch cable installation successful

It is finished.  Apparently the old cable had stretched pretty badly.  I
have more clutch now than I had before and plenty of adjustment left.

All went together fine with little or know problem.  I did grease it up
really good as I shoved it in.

The toughest part was working it through the bowden tube. I eventually
unbolted it from the tranny and worked it on through.  I found that turning
the tube really made the threaded end go through better.

I adjusted so that I have 1/2 inch play at the top, tightened everything and
checked it twice, and took her for a test drive.  All works fine.

I knew it was supposed to be simple but the tips you guys gave helped me
out.  I appreciate it.
