Subject: Need PN for VW sodium filled valve, HELP?
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

For the 1700, just bought a set of NOS heads off ebay, the
guy is representing them as sodium filled exhausts.  Now as
some of us were looking into an order of the Reichert head from
Germany for about $125 each or so bare, the price I am paying
for these is only good if these are indeed $50 each sodium filled
VW valves.

They are stamped 021109612A which he is claiming to be a
sodium filled PN.

My only reference says the sodiums are 021 109 611 or 611A
and lists all 022xxx612x series PN's as regular steel valves. 
They also only appear to be regular steel valves in the pictures
but the pictures are sort of small and I can't tell.

If anyone knows, please tell me.  I have only seen Porsche 2.0
and Vanagon sodiums from VW and those are generally flat
faced with the little 1/8&quot; divot in the center for the sodium, these
do NOT appear to be that way, looking instead like any ole valve.

Yeah I'm crossing this to vintage, sorry.  You can please ignore it
if it you don't care but there are some over there that might know.

I need help.  Thanks.

John
