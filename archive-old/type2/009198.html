&gt;Aaaaw, I guess I'll resort to checking the torsion bars...what the hay,
&gt;I have the husband's money to burn, or that's what he sez.

When I went to readjust my rear tortion bars and replace the rubber
bushings, I was scared witless from all of the stories about 
the bar coming whipping off of there, wreaking havoc and busting
limbs.

Could not have been further from the truth.

I jacked up the bus, put stands under the rear tortion pivots, 
removed all of the bearing housing, CVs and shocks. 
Do one side at a time, so you are more steady. Loosen, then
tighten each bearing housing bolt while it is still on the ground. Removed
the 
cover bolts and cover. Put end of jack under end of tortion
arm, lifted it mabye 1/8th inch, pried the arm outward
about 1/8 inch, and lowered the jack slowly. The tortion arm
end fits in the cup on my jack. It only lowered about an inch.

I used a $5 hanging protractor from Home Dept, measured
the bottom of the rocker panels, subtracted from
the specs, put the bar back on at spec per Bently.
(Shh, dont tell anyone, but I added 1 degree to the spec. Those
tortion bars arent exactly new. It added 3/4 inch to the rear height
over factory specifications. Total lift from before was 2.5 inches)
The hardest part is moving the inner and outer splines
to get the right measurement. I had to move the bar around
about 150 degrees to make up for the slop plus one that degree.
Take your time, eyeball the protractor really hard, estimate
1/2 degree increments because it is marked in 2 degree increments.
Measure on the tortion arm when pulling up on it. When
putting the cover back on, you will need two shock bolts
to pull the cover down. Pull the arm down until it is pushing
against the housing slightly, jack up the arm until it clears,
tighten cover down, pulling it into place. For the bushings,
put them in a sandwich bag with 2 tbsp of talc and shake
and bake.

Total time for job was: (Both sides combined)
1 hour reading up on procedure and marking up alignment stuff.
2 hours disassembling bearing housing, etc. (One hour per side)
.5 hour removing arms.
2 hours cleaning, studying specs, repainting bars, painting inside tortion
housing.
1 hour at installation, measure, remove, reinstall, repeat 5 or 6 times. Take
your time.
1 hour reinstalling everything. Took less time because some of the bearing
housing
bolts took forever to get out. (First time in 28 years for most of them)

I split the job into Saturday afternoon, then Sunday morning. I spent Sat
night putting new bearing races in, and painting the bearing housing and
backing plate. Bake overnight in box with 100 watt bulb. I took my
time with everything, and was working outside on a semi-level driveway.

This should be in the FAQ. If I had taken pictures it could be on
Bartino-Tek. It is summertime, the best time to be doing this
kind of work. This kind of job at a shop would be expensive because
of the time spent getting the measurements right. But, it beats going
down the road tilted.

Have fun. Be Safe. Floss Daily.
