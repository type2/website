Subject: Re: [T2] low riding

Agreed, but dropped spindles for the bay window bus are not as readily
available (cost wise) as they are for splits. I have been bugging bus boys
for years. Franklins VW Werks makes them, but they are pricey.

If a source for bay window dropped spindles is available that I dont know
about, I would love to know...

&gt;
&gt; I disagree that the best way to lower is via torson arm adjusters.  This
&gt; method reduces the available wheel travel and changes the steering
&gt; geometry.
&gt;
&gt; Better are lowering spindles that leave the trailing arms and steering
&gt; tierods where they belong and allow full wheel travel.  They also make it
&gt; much easier to return things to original.
