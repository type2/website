Subject: Re: Ontario source for bay window windsheild

Hi Folks,

I've decided to hang onto my 73 camper, so now my thoughts move on to
replacing the widsheild.
Can anyone in Ontario reccomend a place to replace the front glass and seal?
What'll I pay ??? Seems to me that the insurance business up here has
inflated the cost of windsheild replacement well above the prices I've seen
quoted state-side.

If anyone does have a windsheild for sale in S. Ontario in good condition,
please let me know. I  haven't seen busses in the scrapyards here for years.

Thanks,
