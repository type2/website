Subject: Heavy Duty Torsion Bars?
Message-ID: &lt;3746FA71.B658D275_at_jhunix.hcf.jhu_dot_edu&gt;

Volks:

I was hauling 1200 lbs. of topsoil back from Home Depot yesterday, and
so had a chance to see how my bus would look lowered.  I didn't like it.

Some P.O. had added coils over the rear shocks, and had to load the bags
o' dirt as far back in the main cargo area as I could, to get a level
ride (the front shocks lack the coils).

Anyway, I figure I could add the coils at the front if I plan to
continue to carry such heavy payloads, blah blah blah.  I know we just
went through the coil-over issue again and don't want to start that
thread again.

What I want to know is if there were variations in the thickness of the
torsion bars among different years, or among different models.  Did
busses set up as commercial vehicles have heavier duty torsion bars, in
the front and/or the back?  Based on the relatively minor payload
capacities listed in the '77 owner's manual I just consulted, I'd guess
no, on the reasoning that those variations relate to the variations in
the weight of the vehicle's stock equipment.  But this doesn't rule out
the possibility of a heavier duty option, or of variations among the
different years.

[Background: This occurred to me only in the last couple of days, when I
pulled the rear torsion bars out of a '69 Squareback that I was
scrapping, and saw nice white/yellow? bands of paint on the bars.
Thanks to the type 3 list, I discovered the significance of these paint
bands: the squarebacks have heavier duty torsion bars in the back, and
heavier anti-sway bars (inside the beam, for the type3) in the front.
(I don't know if the front torsion bars are any different yet).]

I'd rather upgrade my springing without the coils, if possible.
