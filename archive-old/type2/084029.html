Subject: Re: [T2] The perfect VW house! (f)

Getting off topic, but it was air-cooled- had a 6 cyl helicopter engine
in it.  For a list of sites in the US where you can see one, click on
the SEE a TUCKER frame of this link:

&gt; Wasn't it the Lustron Corp that was given the Tucker plant from under their
&gt; feet?  I believe the government owned the factory and when Tucker made too
&gt; many enemies around Detroit, the government with pressure from certain
&gt; Senators pulled the lease contract away from Tucker and gave it to Lustron.
&gt; 
&gt; The Tucker was a rear wheeled drive, rear engined air cooled car that had
&gt; features on it in the late 40's that most cars didn't have until the 70's!!
&gt; Fuel injection, disk brakes, padded dash, safety glass windshields, seat
&gt; belts to name a few.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Volks,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; On something of a side issure, I invite your attention to the  following
&gt; &gt; story that appeared in last Saturday's Washington Post:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; http://www.washingtonpost_dot_com/wp-dyn/articles/A53197-2002Feb22.html
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Is this not *the* house for the VW owner?  They are all steel and a bit
&gt; &gt; too small :-)  I am seriously going to pursue buying one!  I have a lot
&gt; &gt; nearby with a very restricted building area and I have spent enough time
&gt; &gt; living in my VW tin can that I can easily imagine living in a tin can w/o
&gt; &gt; the wheels!  And imagine a Dove Blue VW out in front of one of these pale
&gt; &gt; blue enameled steel houses!
