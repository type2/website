What I am most worried about is flash rust and clean parts. Oily
parts gatehr dust, clean parts rust quickly. If I use some type of 
spray grease on a piston that I have cleaned to balance, I will
clog the oil passages if I let the grease harden. If I use
motor oil, it will drip off. 

I should try putting the parts in oil, then in a plastic bag, then
wrap tightly in saran wrap or something to keep the oil by the
parts.
