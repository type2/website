Subject: Re: walk thru dormobile splitty's??

does anyone know if there was ever a walk thru dormbile offered on pre 1968
busses??

On a similar vein does anyone know if walkthru 23 or 21 windows were offered?
If they were I see no 
reason that a walk thru Dorm. could not have been made?
- - - -
they did make walk through 21 and 23 window deluxes.

i have not seen walk though dormobiles, but if they made them i suppose they
would have come with the westy so 42 kit
