Subject: Oxy-Propane Welding?

Although I'm lobbying for all my friends and relations to collaborate and
buy me a welder for Xmas, I'm getting little eye contact and many arched
eyebrows, which makes me think I will probably get socks again.

So I'm looking through an industrial supply catalog and I come across a
little propane-oxygen torch setup. It says this thing burns at 4600
degrees, and it says it can braise, weld or cut. I don't even know what
braising is.

Could this possibly weld body panels? I'm not looking for show-quality
stuff, just rust repair that will hold up. The gas setup is a LOT cheaper
than a real welder.
