Subject: Re: Hall effect distributor - Vanagon

Chris:

Get up underneath the rotating hall shield with two screwdrivers and pry
the shield up, at the center, near the shaft with the screwdrivers pushing
down on the outer edge of the distributor body.  There is a shoulder at the
center of the hall shield where it fits around the distributor shaft. that
is much stronger than the stamped metal at the outside.  This shoulder fits
onto the shaft with an interference fit with a small round pin.  Make sure
you don't loose the pin when it finally pops off.  It feels kinda hairy
prying it, but they can be on there pretty tight.
