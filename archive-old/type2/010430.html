Hi Volks,
I'm am considering purchasing a '79 Westy and was
wondering if I could get some opinions/thoughts on
this particular year of bus. I've read some of the
archives and am aware of the one-year-only thing. That
in itself worries me a bit. Was it a good year for
busses?  This one has FI and a 2.0L engine, manual
tranny. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Rick
