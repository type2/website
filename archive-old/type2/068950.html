Subject: Oil Pressure? 74 Bus 

Hello All!

Still thinking about pulling the engine....so far I think I need only  
pull the heads and cylinders (low compression). I was guessing  that I  
might want to check oil pressure (have to scrounge a gauge from somewhere)  
before I remove the engine to determine if I should also replace the oil  
pump...not sure if I have to crack the case to change the oil pump, will  
check bently tonight,  but for sure the motor would have to be out to  
change it.

Is there anything else I should test while I have the engine  
semi-runnning before I pull it?

Thanks in advance!

David.  74 bus, type IV engine, dual carbs
