Subject: Re: [T2] front seat discomfort

You can usually take the covers and pads off. you might find some of the  
springs broken. What I do is weld back together. Then there are some connector  
pieces that go from one spring to the other. I twist them slightly to add that  
tension that has been long gone. Get new covers and pads and you will be 
riding  comfortable.
