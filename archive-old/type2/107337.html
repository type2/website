Subject: ball joint stripped threads - need help fast

I got my new axle beam on the 71 bus tonight, and only then did I 
notice that that the upper passenger, and lower driver threads on ball 
joints were just a little messed up.  Messed up enough so the nuts I 
took off the old one will start, then hang up.  Right now the bus is in 
the driveway, blocking garage and I'm about to be told to go sleep in 
it tonight and maybe indefinitely.  Seriously, I'm in major trouble 
with the mrs. right now.

Any suggestions on what to do next?

   I would love to hear some one say to try and clean up the threads 
with a tap of the correct size, but what is the size, and who would 
sell one that large?

   Can I replace  just the two torsion arms in question off the old 
beam?  (They look fine, and bus rode great before)

Any advice at all is very appreciated, as I am running out of time, and 
have till saturday to finish this, or the bus or me will probably have 
to go.

Thanks,
Don
