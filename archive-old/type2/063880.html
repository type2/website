&gt; If you look at the Rustoleum can, you'll notice a 
disclaimer..something like
&gt; &quot;this stuff isn't very special...it's just paint.&quot;  De rusto the same.

This is hearsay, but I believe Rustoleum is different in that it has 
something called &quot;fish emulsion&quot; in it. This supposedly is intended as a 
rust inhibitor but has the side effect that subsequent coats of other 
paints won't stick to it; the Rustoleum has to be sanded off.

I remember some guy kvetching because he had painted the entire interior 
bucket of his Jeep with Rustoleum, because he never put the top on and 
the rain came in, and 
it rusted anyway--and he ended up having to sand the entire bucket clean 
to get any paint to lay down after that.

Of course this doesn't apply to primer, though.
