Subject: Brokedown Bus in Colorado Springs

Hi All,

So I was out to Colorado Springs over the weekend and noticied a 74(?) kombi
white/blue that was broke down in a parking lot.

I know that there is at least one person on the list from that area. I don't
know what the deal is but the top hatch to the motor was open and it looks like
a various bits were missing.

It's located in the Bennetts Bar-B-Que parking lot on Academy Road ( I think it
was Academy, I can find out for sure if needed).

Cheers,
Harry
