Subject: Valve adjustment screws

Hey all
Rus here from b-ville working on my 74 standard bug. I
realize this is the type 2 group but im working on my
bug and have a question that someone should be able to
answer.
Im doing a major tune up since its not had one in
quiet awhile......and things are going great....new
plugs points wires coil you get the idea......set the
points get it timed and am trying to adjust the
valves......even that is going well until the last one
of course.......that dang screw is in there so tight
it wont budge and ive sort of messed up the head of
the adjust ment screw......._dot_can i get replacements
for those if i have to go to drastic measures to get
them to loosten? they obviously havent be adjusted in
quiet sometime......ive just had it for about four
months.
Rus
