Subject: Re: [T2] Run Marty, it's the Iraqis...I don't know how they
  found me!!!

&gt;Heh, anyone remember in Back to the Future - Part 1, the Iraqis came after
&gt;the Doc because he had stolen plutonium from them? They found him in the
&gt;parking lot of JC Penny's and they were chasing after him with a moon-roof
&gt;Volkswagen &quot;Bay Window&quot; Bus. The guy was sticking out the top with a rocket
&gt;launcher.

Yeah that bus was what - maybe 5 or 6 years old at the time they crashed 
it? No rust, all factory equipment, no body damage, motor was good I 
suspect, etc. What a waste....

And see - we didn't need to go to war to find out the Iraqi military had 
nuclear weapons. They were trying to acquire them back in 1985... &lt;grin&gt;

Hollywood knew... &lt;grin&gt;

Wonder how many bomb casings with pinball machine parts the US military 
will find in Iraq???
