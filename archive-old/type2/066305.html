OK all you very detail-oriented bus-heads,

As long as we're running down all the various camper configurations,
someone please answer me this:

I've seen late '60's buses in So CA with a poptop made by an American 
conversion company I think was called ASI? The logo has the three letters
of the name in kind of a triangular squashed shape. The luggage rack is on
the front like in the late '70's loafs (loaves?), but the top stands a couple
of inches taller. The top pops straight up with an x-bracket kind of suppport,
instead of popping up like a big hinge the way the Westfalia tops do. They make
a nice double bed like the late '70's Westy's and they even have a little dome 
light on the inside of the top. Everybody got the search image?

OK, now my question: For what years were these little gems made? 
Specifically, were any of these made for the highly regarded 1971 bus? Any
sense of numbers, relative to all buses, or to Westfalias? 

If there are any '71 ASI campers out there, they would be my candidate for 
&quot;the very best VW camper to own.*&quot; 

Gentlefolk, start your encyclopedic memories! Does my dream bus exist?

* IMHO only. Your actual dream bus will vary. :-)
