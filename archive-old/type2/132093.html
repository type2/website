&gt; IT IS VERY DANGEROUS TO SWITCH TO AN ELECTRIC FUEL PUMP
&gt; 
&gt; If you switch from a mechanical fuel pump to an electrical fuel pump, you
&gt; may create a very dangerous condition unless you go to great lengths to
&gt; properly wire up the electrical fuel pump.
&gt; 
&gt; go back to the tried and true mechanical fuel pump. The mechanical fuel pump
&gt; is much more reliable and safer. Why bother will all that wiring.

i agree with this. we have been buying NOS fuel pumps whenever we see them
and we have a few at $90.00.

i am not a big fan of the facet electric pump, they are noisy and somehwhat
unreliable. we do sell an electric pump, it is a pierburg pump, very quiet
and robust. as it happens, pierburg is also the OEM for many of the
carburated VW mechanical pumps. the rotary pump sells for approximately $US
54.00. 

i would never install an electric pump without providing fail-safe shutoff
circuitry.
