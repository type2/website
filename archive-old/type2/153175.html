&gt;Craig,

&gt;Yep!  Been watching and recording it.  Don't remember what the s/c went
&gt;for, but seems like about 40k+.


yeesh. the owner was a super nice guy, and i'm glad for him (he had a 
gorgeous 57 napco suburban, too), but it was NOT worth that imho. the 
tranny leaked fluid on me while i was under there. the engine was 
clean up top, but wet below.  it had 113 xxx xxx tranny numbers - 
shouldn't a bus have a 211 tranny?  and while eric says it was 
original as far as he knew, i saw some popped spotwelds on the gates, 
and i think it had been repainted.   still a VERY sweet truck; had i 
the cash, i would gladly  have written a check for 15K for a nice, 
running, classic bus.  but aside from a few chrome bits and 
accessories, i've seen busses with FAR rarer option codes. shoot, it 
was a single-door treasure chest;  my 65 has 2, was factory 12 volt, 
and has the heavy-duty air filter. MY bus is worth about $400, 
however LOL!

i just think the words barrett-jackson added 50% to the price right 
off the bat.

&gt;
&gt;Their discussion of the one bug I have seen go thru the line was pathetic,
&gt;except that it had every NOS accesory on it that was available.


i'd say, good, that'll keep prices down... but i guess not!
