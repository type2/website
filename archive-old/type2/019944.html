Time for my weekly plug! Used parts for sale:
http://home.earthlink_dot_net/~shrike3/parts/nixyard.html

All you other VW entrepreneurs need to know that, if dealing with one
Jason Antolovich (formerly antolovich_at_earthlink_dot_net), be sure to get
payment UP FRONT. I sent him a set of heater boxes back in July. His
e-mails bounce, his phone's disconnected. Would anyone in the
Indianapolis area be willing to pay a visit to the residential address?
Darnit, he was my first sale, too.
