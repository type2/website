I know it probably sounds really smarmy, but I was telling David C. in
Phoenix how I think getting my bus is the best thing that's ever
happened to me. I'd been getting progressively more agoraphobic over the
past few years, and this gets me out of the house and out of town on the
weekends. It gives me something to talk about -- people just walk up to
me (not typical Californian behavior) and start telling me their bus
stories, recommending places to visit. 

Thanks to The List, I've got friends everywhere I go, and a support
network to fall back on when needed. I've got a puzzle to stretch my
brain constantly -- &quot;Is that a normal noise? A normal smell? What to
do?&quot; 

I'm having more fun decorating it -- every bus is a unique work of art
in progress, I've discovered. And it's really hard to be cynical when
you're driving something that just looks so cheerful -- plus there's
that waving thing on the road. I saw a bus going the other way on I-20
in Texas, and we were just about falling out our windows waving to each
other! 

It's even got me cooking!!! That's nothing short of a miracle.

Nikki
