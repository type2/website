&gt;&gt; I don't have that big black knob to adjust the drivers seat.  I feel as I
have been left out now. &lt;&gt; don't feel too bad.  It doesn't do all that much!
&lt;&lt;

A friend just drove my 68 this past weekend and he thought the smaller black
knob slid the seat back (as I did the first time) and the plastic knob came
off in his hand.  Glad to know now what it really does.  Mine does not stay
in both positions.  Is it supposed to stay put on either end of the throw?
The P.O. put carpet down that covers the walkthrough.  If I lift it up,
where is the vent?  I'd like to uncover it.

I also found a similar knob under the dash behind the fiberboard cover.
Another vent control?  For what?

On to the seat:  Mine is broken although the big knob does in fact move one
side of the seat back (the other side just floats loosely).  How do I remove
the seat to either fix or replace it.  Obviously it's not as easy as the
passenger seat.  Thanks,

j a clary
