&gt;Really?  But every Mercedes has an ashtray.  Let's see if I 
&gt;understand:  Smoking and driving is okay, but drinking a soda while driving 
&gt;isn't?  Excuse me for snickering but the US Yuppies were right on in this
case.
&gt;
&gt;I have two cup holders in the front of my bus, and am considering adding 
&gt;two more.  Reason being sometimes my SO and I order two drinks AND two ice 
&gt;cream sundaes at the drive through.  You can never have enough cup holders.
&gt;

That's just fine, David. Not having coke or chocolate malt spill in your
lap and soak into your upholstry 'cause all of a sudden you come up upon a
turkey neck just as you looked down to grasp that cup for the next suck of
the straw, and a clean vehicle and ass is less important that the accident
about to happen is just another viewpoint that predominates in der
Fatherland. I consider that to be a more rational approach to safety, even
though I too have been guilty of screwing around with a cigarette or a
burger when safe driving demanded better concentration. So, since I choose
to practice a less rational behavior, does it follow I have the right to
demand that those who are more rational service my irrational actions? I
don't, but it is certain the majority of yuppies do, hence all the growing
wizbang on what used to be known as a more inspired philosphy of design. 

&quot;Dangit, put that wizbang on there or I won't buy it, no matter how
rational you think my demand might be! And while your at it, put a TV/VCR
in the dash to amuse me on my daily commute, dangit, 'cause I like to watch
the news while I'm eating and drinking and cell phoning and GPSing...oh,
and driving, don't neglect the horsepower, I want more next year or I won't
buy again on my raw neo-capitalist climb up the ladder to big gotten gains
so I'll have more power to demand more, rationale be damned.&quot;

It's reason=value for me, not money=reason. I know I'm in the minority in
this view. It doesn't follow that I will shut up 'cause the majority may
not appreciate my method. 

If a client comes to me and says, &quot;Make this wizbang work, damn the
cost!!&quot;, I give them the following condition of my employment. I will
pursue this experiment only if you accept there is no warrenty or garantee
as to workmanship, parts or results, and I have no basis for any estimate
at all. Give me a blank check and I will pursue your demand with a sincere
and steadfast purpose to accomplish proper function through calculation,
experiment, trial and error, study, intuition, and God's inspiration and
bill you for actual hours. 

You can say stop any time you want and pay for time and materials spent.
Only under these terms do I feel confident that success in the endeavor is
at least possable. And if the results are sound, if there is any patentable
idea present in this job, it is yours to file on and market. I don't want a
dime over my time that has to do with selling wizbang. It's the difference
between making money, value be damned, or earning a living without
violating values.
