Subject: Accelarator pump tube??? (to be or not to be!)

Me again, sorry for asking so many questions but i am leaving in 2 weeks 
for the big one (or so) and a am still working on those spare Solex 
carbs. And i still have one very important question!

If you take a look at the following link you will see that the acc pump 
tube is missing on a right carb, but is doesn't  look broke, many of the 
14!!! use carbs that i have are missing this tube, some are broken, 
loose or simply missing. I wonder if some years / generation didn't have 
the tube????
http://pages.infinit_dot_net/engine/test4.htm

I just receive this carb, it's amost new! the buterfly shaft is tight 
like a rock, but i wonder about the missing tube. Not a real problem, i 
have other upper body with the tube still on it but this carb look so 
new that i would  like to use this upper body!!! 

Any advice
Thanks guys!
Ben
ps.: about the 400F head temp question, i am using &quot;Super&quot; for fuel!!!!!!
