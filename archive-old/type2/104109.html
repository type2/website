Yes!  You need long reach plugs to ignite the mixture properly.  A short
reach plug will be shrouded by the long hole!

Mexican
engines come with (IIRC) BP5ES-A plugs.  I've never been able to find the
&quot;-A&quot; plugs, but regular BP5ES plugs work fine.  In NGK numbering the B is
the thread diameter, The P means projected electrodes (they stick out a
bit further), the 5 is the heat range (smaller numbers are hotter), the E
means long reach (short reach is H) and the s means it's a standard plug
(V is small electrode).

I've found that NGK plugs are of more consistent quality than even Bosch.
Since VW heads are aluminum that is important.

A lot of VW suppliers are unaware of the long reach heads now coming from
Mexico and Brazil.  It's up to the people who own those engines to specify
the correct parts.  If you sell a bus so equipped, be sure to tell the new
owner of the difference!
