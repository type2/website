hey hey now...
I don't think I regret that remark ;-) as I have had to work my little arse off
to get stella the way I like her.  All of you fine folks who have seen Stella
(David S., Stephen W., Woody etc.) know that Stella is quite the ride.  She has
little flaws all over...mainly the body now.  No hits or dents, just rustage.
I'm 16 now, but I was 15 when I got Stella.  I worked on her for 2 months to be
able to drive her and now I have a blast.  She wasn't such a great vehicle when I
got her...but now she may not be the best...but I'm proud of her.  I go camping
in her whenever I can and drive her all the time.  We'll just have to wait and
see what happens with the 63 i got recently.  http://www.luckyboys_dot_com/bus.htm

so yes, there are teenagers who treat cars like schtuff, but there are others who
are proud of them and treat them as best they can.  I think that was what you
were trying to say, but not sure.
I know Dan (from IL) has his hands full and enjoys working on his V-dubs too.  We
both plan on making a career out of this stuff eventually.

hope I'm not rambling too much ;-)

adios

&gt; If you want to evaluate a vehicle, give it to a teen-age boy.  Note:  I
&gt; stress &quot;give!&quot;  If they have to work for it the test will not work.  If you
&gt; give it to a teen-age boy and it hold up for a week or more, it probably is a
&gt; great vehicle.  So, if someone with two teen-age boys have vehicle problems,
&gt; I don't worry about that too much.
