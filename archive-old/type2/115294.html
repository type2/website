Subject: Blowby -

RE:  '78 2.0 FI Standard Trans USA specs.

I have decent compression (125, 125, 130, 135) but excessive blowby at 
speeds in excess of 62.5 MPH (100 km)

Is there some pressure relief vlave in the heads that may be blocked, 
causing increased pressure in the push rod tubes, which then blows the oil 
out past the Push Rod Tube seals??

At speeds of 70 MPH, I lose oil out the front and back of the engine, also.  
I never travel at those speeds anymore.

TIA
