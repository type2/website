Subject: Stupid Mistake? RESOLVED?

I'm the guy rebuilding a 1970 Type2, with son Erik, with the weird valve 
timing problems.

After all the diagnostics I finally cracked the case.

Scratched my head for a couple of days, then it hit me.

I put in a new cam that came with a bolt-on gear.

If the gear with the notched tooth was not oriented right the timing would 
be screwy.

Could not find any info in the manuals on orienting the gear on the 
camshaft (all three).

So, a buddy of mine gave me one of his old cams with the gear attached.

My cam had the gear attached about 1/3 of a turn off compared to his!!!!

It turns out that the mark on the tooth of the gear should be aligned with 
the slot on the end of the cam. (Duh!)

I oriented my gear like that on the old cam.

Will put the engine back in this weekend.  Hope to report success on Mon.

Thanks to all.

Bill and Erik Spencer
