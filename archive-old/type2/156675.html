Subject: West Coast Heat Spell / Aircooleds

Just a probably controversial comment about octane
ratings and the heat wave... If you're not running
premium, do so in this heat, at least. If you're
running a CHT gauge or an EGT gauge or even an oil
temp gauge I can guarantee you will see immediately
the difference higher octane will make in the heat. I
had made some adjustments to the cooling system on my
bus (subey water cooled now) and it doesn't have the
cooling capacity it had when I first built it. Upon
arriving home today from 200 miles of freeway driving,
the fan just did not seem to want to shut off (urban
heat ~96 degrees or so) I had to fuel up before
running some errands and figured I'd switch up from
the 89 octane mid-grade I've been running. I saw about
a ten degree drop on the temp and the fan almost never
came on. No other differences, and this is on a '92
Subaru that is supposed to be able to run on 87
octane. Imagine what it can do for your aircooled
(survival!) -BaH
