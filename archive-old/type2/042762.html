Subject: hi-lift_dot_com, replacement jacks to 25 inches!!

Ok, I just found this, and maybe im missing why this may not work, but this 
site, hi-lift_dot_com sells just that - higher jacks for jeeps and farm 
equipment and whatnot. Although its not hydro... it may be an option... 
anyone seen one in use?

sooo close to finishing my trip preperations, just need to get all these 
little 'just in case' items, in hopes ill never have to use them while out 
far far from home.

Thanks

Chris

&gt;Hi,
&gt;	I have a trolley jack I got from Machine Mart- it's much better
&gt;built
&gt;than the cheapo pressed steel items that the FLAPS carry but I don't carry
&gt;it in the bus because it's so damn heavy. I had to exchange the first set
&gt;of axle stands that I got because they were too short, so watch out for the
&gt;height on them, too!
&gt;
&gt;  Just Kampers carry replacement Bilsteins, if that's what's wanted. IMHO 
&gt;the
&gt;stock jack is a pretty good compromise between size and utility, given that
&gt;you want to carry it all the time but never use it! They list them for £34.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;	 W.
