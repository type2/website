Ok,
    This question is going to take some thought, and probably those that
have changed from FI to carbs will know what to do.

I have an 81 Vanagon westy, that the PO switched to carbs.   I have since
rebuilt the motor, and switched to dual Weber 44's.  Spent today dialing
them in, and it purrs like a kitten.

I had noticed that the after market fuel pump the PO installed runs on and
on when I turn the key on.  It does not build pressure and stop.  So, I
bought a CB performance rotary fuel pump, and although quieter, it does the
same thing.  The former return line is plugged off at the tank, and I even
took off the gas cap to see if venting was a problem.   Still ran on.

I figure pressure should build up in the fuel line and stop.  Nothing is
leaking fuel.

What next?
