Art,

There used to be some good places in Albuquerque if she can get it 
there...that was many years ago in a different universe though&lt;grin&gt;

maybe some local folks can chime in here.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi Folks;
&gt;    My daughter is in college in Socorro New Mexico, called today and it
&gt; seems her '77 Baja has developed a (probably) fatal engine problem.
&gt; Massive oil leak, coming from the seam in the case forward of the oil
&gt; strainer. We rebuilt this engine (1600 DP) in 1998 using quality parts
&gt; and it has been a strong runner for five years, carrying her zillions of
&gt; miles up and down mountains, on 75 mph interstates etc.
&gt;
