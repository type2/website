Subject: VDO CHT update

Just a little something more on the previous CHT tests that I did.

I still had my new probe and gauge sitting out and had another probe that 
I took off another car(for 18mm plugs).  Both &quot;factory&quot; VDo probes, but 
one for bus spark plugs and one for the smaller plugs.  

Ran the same test as before and found that one &quot;probe&quot; ran 25 degrees 
different than the other.

Bottom line, it's a really crappy set up.  More on the other &quot;thermister&quot; 
probe setup that I am going to try soon.

Cheers, dave
