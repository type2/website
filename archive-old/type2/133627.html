Subject: Re: Source for cylinder shims

I rented an engine from a friend (for beer) and before I put it in service
I wanted to get it to stop leaking oil so bad. I took the heads and
cylinders off and found, or so I thought until now, shims that were for
different sized cylinders. They had been snipped and compressed a bit to
make their circumference a bit smaller. Then the engine builder used a
liberal amount of blue silicone to seal up that mess. After running that
engine for a couple years I gave it back and we later wanted to use it in
another Bus and my friend decided that the end play should be set before
putting it back in. It was then that I found that the builder had put 2
main seals on, again with plenty of blue goop, to try to cut down on
leaks. Its amazing that I was able use this as my daily driver, including
trips to L.A., for as long as I did.

The moral of the story is, use the slinky at your own risk.
