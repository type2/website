Subject: Re: tdc?  

True TDC is set when the engine is built. The cam is supposed to be set
with the distributor drive gear in a precise position. If the distributor
drive gear is just a little off, TDC for that engine is changed. I don't
think a *relative* change in TDC has any bearing on performance, it just
makes tuning a particular engine an exercise for your brain...but I could
be wrong on this. I'm no mechanic.

As I understand it, you can get a puller for the distributor drive gear and
pull it up through the distributor hole; then you can set it back in the
proper position. This might be more important on Type IV engines, where you
dont' have much room to move the dizzy, due to the vacuum cansiter and the
position of that distributor hole. I've managed to set my timing gear
properly on the Type 4 I built though. :)

Have fun! Joe

&gt;is top dead center (tdc) the same on all 72-79 type iv's???
&gt;
&gt;my timing scale reads tdc different than where it truly is.  i pulled
&gt;a spark plug #1 and felt exactly where tdc was.  for me the notch in
&gt;my fan pulley lined perfectly vertical (like on the old upright
&gt;motors), yet my scale reads tdc, like 2 inches over to the left.  
&gt;
&gt;if i went with what the scale would read, IF it went that far, tdc
&gt;would read at like about 16 atdc!!

 Thought for the SIG: &quot;What if suddenly, as we were tooling along, 
                       God turned to us for help; what if he needed 
                       /us/, for just a moment...or it would all 
                       fall apart?&quot; ...just a thought to ponder
