Thanks,

I hadn't thought of that, I do have an EZ out set, a cheap one, but 
none the less, I do have a set. I also have titanium drill bits.

If the Funky Chicken with the Vise Grips does not work as one list 
member suggested, then I will try that.

Hey, only three more joints to go after this one!!!

But if I fix this drive shaft, the vehicle is driveable again, however, it 
is off the road until safety time.

&gt; Since you've gotten several of the bolts out, take one to the hardware
&gt; store and see if you can match it up with an EZ-OUT tool. There are two
&gt; types; one has straight sharp edges and the other is a spiral type.
&gt; ou'll
&gt; just need to make your decision on which one will work.
