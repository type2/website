Subject: Idle solenoid woes
Date: Sun, 28 Feb 1999 20:37:52 -0700

Ok this should be pretty simple, but it's been
frustrating me for weeks.

More and more frequently, the idle cut-off solenoid
refuses to pull out on startup. It will usually pull
out after a few minutes (heat, vibration), or a quick
tap with the butt end of a screwdriver on the case while
energized. It will be ok for awhile then....so it's not
like it's binding on anything. If I pull the wire to it
and touch it to the contact, it will give a pretty puny
spark, but once I tap on the casing, it will thunk in and
out just fine.

First thing I did was make a new wire for it and the choke,
so that connection's not in question. I swapped the solenoid
with one from an old carb and it worked ok for a couple of days,
but the problem returned. I cleaned up the trans/frame ground
strap. I took some voltage readings -- 12.4 from battery + terminal
to frame ground (rear decklid catch on apron), 11.8 on the + side
of the coil/solenoid/choke bus. I know that's a tad low, but that's
where it's wanted to run for as long as I can remember. The
voltage readings are about .01v less when ground is the oil
filler.

Now I'm thinking back to my basic electricity classes, and I know
that a solenoid is a reactive load (being a coil), and that
voltage is not as important as current for its operation. The
choke works fine, and that's a resistive load.

So though I think my next step is plunking down 20 bucks for
another solenoid, I'm wondering if I'm not getting enough
current through the circuit. The bus is running fine otherwise,
though, and I'd think I'd see some spark-related problems if I'm
not getting enough juice to the coil.

Been there/done that stories, SWAGs, and other input is welcome.
