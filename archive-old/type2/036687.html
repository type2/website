Hi Jeff:

I don't know mutch about Solex carbs.  Maybe the old fuel filter is dirty 
enough to inhibit good flow to your new carb.  Unless of course, you've 
replaced that already.

Good luck with your rig.

&gt;Hi everyone,
&gt;     I just installed a new solex 34pict3 in my bus and when I started it 
&gt;up,
&gt;it coughed and sputtered and basically ran like crap. I couldn't get the
&gt;idle to smooth out no matter which screw I turned. What could this be?
&gt;Adjusting the air/fuel mixture makes absolutely no noticeable difference to
&gt;the way it runs. At least these new symptoms have helped my bus name
&gt;herself: Weezy.
&gt;
&gt;TIA,
