Subject: Hydralic Lifters.... HELP
Date: Mon, 15 Feb 1999 19:56:17 -0600
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I just bought a 78 van with a 2.0 liter motor in it and I have problems :)
I have a lifter sticking...(something is tapping) After trying to figure out
why the valves were not moving when I rotated the engine and then realizing
that they were hydralic and were not going to move till the motor was
running (that is right? right?) I started the engine and let it idle while I
watched the valves moving back and forth (wasn't near as much oil as I
thought there would be) Cylinder # 1 appeared to be working correctly but
Cylinder #2 exhaust did not move hardly at all (the intake moved but not as
much as on Cylinder #1)

I drove the van aprox 3 days when I purchased it the previous owner
mentioned that the valve would &quot;stick&quot; and rattle for just a few moments and
then run like normal (quietly)
Second day: drove aprox 20 miles and it started rattleing.... stopped after
another 8 miles
Third day: started rattleing imediately so I parked it
my question.... is this as simple as I need to change the oil (its dirty and
I haven't changed it yet) or how can I tell if its just a valve out of
adjustment or if the lifter is clogged? and if its a lifter clogged what do
I do?
Thanks in a BIG way
