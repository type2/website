Paul, 
In reading this, you touched on a question I have been trying to figure
out.  The back of the heater box connects to the bottom of the cooling fan,
Why?  Also, from reading another email, there used to be one way doors
(that I do not have nor are they available) that would let air out but not
in, how would air travel the opposite direction if the cooling fan is
constantly blowing air out?  Last, in junk yards, a popular fix seems to be
putting duct tape around this area, does this help anything? (looked pretty
rigged, there must be a better way)

Any answers you guys can give would be great

Harry


&gt;If you haven't done it already, make sure the holes for the heater
&gt;pipes... the ones the fan would hook to... are plugged until you get the
&gt;heater stuff back in there. Otherwise, you're going to be sucking hot
&gt;air into the engine compartment from under the cylinders... not a good
&gt;thing for the engine cooling situation.
