Subject: Re: [T2] front mounted tires.

Well now....&quot;Janis&quot; was dent'ed by the PO before I mounted the spare tire up 
front and it serves very well to help hide that front end damage ;&gt;)

Volks, It's my good fortune not to have ever relied on it to protect her 
from ramming other vehicles or trees for that mater.  A stout &quot;roobar&quot; I 
think would be the only viable form of protection at the expense of weight.  
It is simply my intention not to bump anything with the exception of small 
trees and branches.
