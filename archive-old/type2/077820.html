&lt;&lt; can a fuel-injected engine tolerate more advance at, say 2500rpm than a 
dual carburated engine?  Or a single-carbbed engine?  Does valve size affect 
timing?  How about rod length?  Displacement?  Combustion chamber shape? &gt;&gt;

I always assumed that changes in these areas over the years and the 
subsequent need for changes in the advance curve _are_the reason for the many 
different distributor models used over the years.  I guess the basic question 
is how many of the changes that create a need for altering the advance curve 
are associated with bottom end case/crank/rod design and how many are related 
to top end &quot;everything else&quot;.

Its kind of humorous to see how many in the aftermarket parts industry 
expects us to overlook 40 years of constant engineering developments and the 
many engine &quot;recipes&quot; folks use to enhance the performance of ACVW's when 
they sell us the &quot;one size fits all&quot; advance curve of a straight out the box 
.009.

It seems to me that timing is just too critical an aspect of engine's 
performance to spend thousands of dollars on a performance engine and then 
not try to get the curve right!
