i would like this to go to a bus member who could use it.  a couple of you 
had expressed interest but nothing has been finalized so i have to post it 
here or on ebay, its not being used by me.  i will sell it all for $250.  
this INCLUDES some of the delivery.  i am in Omaha, ne and am willing to 
travel up to about 8-10 HRS. to meet someone to deliver this.  the bed and 
window are well worth that.  everything is in excellent shape, and the color 
of upholstery is tan.  the bed is the only part that has rips in it.

yes i know this should be posted on a friday i apologize.  please p-mail me 
if interested.
