Subject: Missing engine parts.


Hey everyone, I am going through my engine compartment trying to figure out 
what parts I am missing. I have the Muir book, but it isnt exaclty totally 
clear on the &gt; 1972 bus engine compartment. I guess I need a picture of a 
stock compartment with all the doo-hickeys in place. Also, will the Bentley 
be more descriptive of the engine compartment? Specifically I think that most 
of my heater system is missing.

My photo_album site has some pictures of the engine compartment.

Thanks in advance.

Tyler.
