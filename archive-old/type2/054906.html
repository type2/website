Subject: Re: Replacement Jack.

Hi,
	I have a trolley jack I got from Machine Mart- it's much better
built
than the cheapo pressed steel items that the FLAPS carry but I don't carry
it in the bus because it's so damn heavy. I had to exchange the first set
of axle stands that I got because they were too short, so watch out for the
height on them, too!

 Just Kampers carry replacement Bilsteins, if that's what's wanted. IMHO the
stock jack is a pretty good compromise between size and utility, given that 
you want to carry it all the time but never use it! They list them for £34.

Cheers,
	 W.
