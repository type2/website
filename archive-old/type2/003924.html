Subject: Engine Swap Info Needed
Date: Tue, 17 Nov 1998 20:26:07 -0800

This will be a long one!  I have a '75 Westfalia that I bought with a seized
'76 motor installed.  The '76 motor was using a single carb (not a Weber)
instead of the stock FI.  None of the FI components are present.  The title
to this vehicle is branded &quot;SALVAGE&quot;.

I purchased a running '74 motor with the stock dual carbs (from list member
Scott Solomon - certifiably nice guy!).  Before I pulled this motor, didn't
check compression, but it sounded pretty good, though it wouldn't idle,
presumable due to dirty carbs, old fuel, etc.

Now the questions begin:

Will there be any compatibility problems with this swap?  Will the
transmission shaft be the right length for this motor, etc.?

Since $ is tight, am I a complete fool to just install this motor without
rebuilding it?  (That's a dumb question to ask - none of you know this
particular motor...) I've ordered rebuild kits for the carbs.  Any other
low-dollar, high-return work I MUST do before installing?  Scott recommended
I do at least a ring job, since it was blowing a little bit of white smoke
when he ran it for me.  If it means anything, the oil looked, smelled and
felt ok.

I see that the exhaust manifolds and heat exchangers are very different
between the two motors.  Will the 76 parts fit the '74 engine?  And if they
do, which set-up should I go with?  Both sets are in similar (fair to good)
condition.

I'd like to use the stock '74 air filter/intake system, but I'm missing one
of the pieces (flattened tube) that connect the air filter box to the carbs.
Anyone have a spare?

I don't have a stock distributor for this engine, but I do have two good
009's.  What timing setting should I use for this engine/carb/dizzy
combination?  I'm also considering installing electronic ignition - haven't
had a car with points for ten years, don't like playing with them.

More than a few questions, I know. I would appreciate any/all advice!  I'm
very familiar with the H2O cooled, fuel injected VW engines - I've owned
several, from Rabbits to Vanagons, but the air-cooled carbureted engine is
new to me!

TIA,
