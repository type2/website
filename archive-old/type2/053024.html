Subject: Stumped: 3 &amp; 4 won't fire

OK, I give. Cylinders 1 &amp; 2 seem to be firing right along, but I can take
the wires off the .009 for 3 &amp; 4 with no noticeable difference in the engine
at idle or high rpm (there are sparks), so I'm guessing there's nothing
happening there...

Here's what I've checked:

* Compression is 140 all the way across; it's a new engine.
* Dwell is at 49.3 _at_ 1000 rpm, 48.7 _at_ 2000.
(Bentley says a variation of 1% or more could mean worn distributor on the
stock vac advance. It's a .009 though, so I'm not sure whether this applies.
There's also a lot of play when I grab the distributor shaft and jiggle it.
I'm not sure if this is acceptable or not. I had a 74 bug with a 009 and it
seemed to have some play to it too.)
* Gap on points is good, but there might be some pitting. Still, would it
only affect cylinders 3 &amp; 4? And wouldn't bad points &amp; condensor be
reflected in the dwell?
* Plugs are fairly new (1000 miles) and have a nice grayish brown tinge. New
plug wires; all Bosch.
* Valves adjusted 400 miles ago.

I guess my next step is to get a timing light and see if that has anything
to do with it, but as a test I made some incremental adjustments to see if
it had any affect. Nada.

My next step is to check the syncing of the carbs (dual Weber 34 ICT),
though this was done recently by a pro. Then I might just go ahead and
replace the points, condensor, distributor cap, and rotor. Hell, I might
even switch to a stock vac advance if I can find one.

Is there anything I've missed?

Cheers,
Victor
