&gt;How do i test the individual injectors? Is there a better way than just
disconnecting them while &gt;running to listen for a change?

Pull them up out of the manifold and visually watch the spray pattern as
someone runs the starter. Do ground the coil wire for this test. They
should produce an atomized round cone pattern, very geometric. Any abscence
of symetry is indication of contaminated pintles/orifaces.

&gt;I have heard of some method of syncronizing the amount they spray.  Is
this something that can be &gt;done at home or need a shop?

Requires spezialized equipment and skills. I recall recently seeing that
Pacific Fuel Injection does this service for quite a reasonable price,
moneywise, but timewise Gus is always burried with backlog. First it was 4
to 6 weeks to rebuild an MFI pump. 6 weeks later it is &quot;I'm backlogged, 3
more weeks.&quot; 

A huge backlog typically represents the best possible reputation for
getting results in a highly spezialized and rare skill. Also could indicate
he is underpriced for the market realities of demand for his services.
Another very good indicator for finding vendors of high skill in spezialty
services. They answer their own phone and address all issues reasonably
right then and there and in the rare case they must say, &quot;I'll have to get
back to you.&quot;, they do. An indicator of highest possible value received.
That's old world value, mind you.

But do check with the vendors who service big semi trucking diesel industry
systems. Many of them have the equipment and skills to balance injector
flow. Independant repair shops that typically service Bosch equiped auto's
sometimes have the equipment to measure flow rates with the bench testing
equipment, but not what is needed to adjust the rates for balancing. I
would expect any Bosch Authorized Service Center to have the test equipment
to verify the balance of your injectors. They can also clean the whooly
s**t out of them if we got bad cone structure. If they are in spec, you
have eliminated them as a possible cause of your problem/s. If one is
lean/rich and the others fine, you know to only to buy one injector. You
spend no more or less time/money than is necessary to resolve the issue for
REAL by confirming all facts by inspection.  

What really amazes me the the number of 15-20 year old Bosch injectors I
have seen function nominal. I have replaced only a few dozen in the last 10
years, both diesel and gas. If you can find it, Lubri-Moly US/Liqui-Moly
Germany make a products called Ventil Sauber and Jectron that can really
clean up and resolve dirty injectors and valves and combustion chambers. 

Is this unique stuff??? My wholesaler cannot legally ship it UPS to me, but
I can pick it up at will-call or could call for the daily truck delivery if
I was within their delivery area. It's very spendy, but works very well if
contamination is your concern. Follow instructions. If you use these
addatives too much it will surely foul your plugs. Just a one shot
treatment every 10-20k or 2 years. More available is the Chevron Techron.
They make several grades. Insure results by buying the spendier high
detergent blend, but it costs even more than the Jectron. 

STAY AWAY FROM LOSS LEADER ADDATIVES. If they worked well, they wouldn't
need spezial pricing to match the low values received from panaceas.
