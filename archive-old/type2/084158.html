Yeah, that's it! I showed your pic of a doublecab to my wife and she says I

&gt; &gt; I really would like this info if you have it. I have some pictures but
&gt; &gt; nothing &quot;close up&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; Here's a project bus that was rusting across town.  I have
&gt; not seen it for months.   I've seen one other like it, which
&gt; was completely finished.   I regret not taking more photos
&gt; and especially a photo of the right side.  I forget how the
&gt; sliding door was 'modified'.
