William asks:
&gt;  Out of interest, is there anyone here who can say they were able to
prevent
&gt; damage to a stock engine, through the use of gauges, which would have
&gt; happened
&gt; otherwise? ie not &quot;I heard it pinking and noticed the oil pressure was
low&quot;
&gt; or &quot;I smelt hot oil and saw the CHT was rising&quot; but &quot;everything was going
&gt; perfectly and then the oil pressure started to drop. I pulled over and
&gt; found that my engine was about to explode with no other indication!&quot;.

Yes!  On my way back from an 1100 mile trip down the Baja Peninsula *1984*
after camping for the evening in a 69 westy with a stock 1600 dual port
*that I  installed* with just one VDO oil pressure guage.

As I started out *at first light* in the morning to drive to a surf spot
that I knew of. I just happened to look down at my guage, and it was reading
0.  There was no other indication of strange noises or anything from the
engine.  Immediately pulled over &amp; shut down.  Went to the back  to take a
look see, and before I opened the engine compartment looked under the bus to
see a large puddle forming on the left side of the engine. Yep, you guessed
it, (oil on the left side of the engine) blown oil cooler, and it wasn't the
seals, it was the cooler itself.  Hmmm,  still 500 miles below the border in
Mexico, that gauge saved my engine down on the Baja Peninsula *desert* coast
but, help! Does anyone have an extra oil cooler for a 1600 dual port. Oh
yeah, and a floor jack would have been nice.  Will tell you how it turned
out on Friday.
