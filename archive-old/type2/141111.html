Subject: Re: [T2] 1978 2.0L FI unit Spark Plug Swap - head removal? Not
  necessarily

Well heck then Adam, that is an easy fix, the head does come off, and off
you go to the machine shop for a threadsert or whatever insert of your
choice. I thought the engine was still in the van. Motorcycle shops are VERY
familiar with this fix, you might want to consider one of them too.

&gt; Hi there:
&gt;
&gt; I am in Portland.  Engine is out of the bus with all Tin removed.  I tried
&gt; the rethread trick to no avail.
&gt;
&gt; I have looked on the shop list that Larry Chase put together and I am
going
&gt; to go out today and check on two shops.  D&amp;M or M&amp;M in the Beaverton area,
&gt; and then another one on the SE side of town.
