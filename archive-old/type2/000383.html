Actually a Kemperink conversion is as follows:

- You start with a standard single cab pickup.
- You cut the thing in two (in the middle).
- Extend the frame members by about 3 feet.
- Add bodywork to make a big square box shaped cargo area
- Create opening side doors like on a splitty (no sliding doors on the bay)

Kemperink started to do that in the fifties with Splitties and continued
with Bays. I don't think they ever did Vanagons. They were VW approved and
sold though the VW dealer network. Kemperink is still in business and now
does special conversions but no big boxes like the old ones anymore.

I think their original idea came from a company thay wanted a van for
voluminous but light loads (Bolletje Biscuits) back in the early fifties
when the availability of small trucks and vans was limited, the heyday of
the split. Locally these conversions are also known as 'Bolletje buses'
because of their origin. 'Bolletje' is Dutch for little ball.

Many have been converted to campers (lotsa room). An original unmodified one
is rare. And yes they are all under-powered! (think about a 1300 cc split
with this setup ...) I think they have the standard gearing but Holland is a
very flat country (like Florida but without the 'gaters).

&quot; I want Bolletje&quot; used to be painted over the sides. Other uses were for
clothes transportation (dry-cleaning companies etc).
