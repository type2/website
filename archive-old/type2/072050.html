Subject: electrical/fuel help needed

hi: i got the tranny into neutral! now the serious stuff. two issues i
could use help with -
1) fuel is now flowing through the pump to the carb, but the engine cuts
out as if it ran out of gas. i can get it going again if i fill the small
round tube at the top of the carb with fuel. it'll cut out at idle quickly,
and with acceleration until the bit of fuel is burned.
2) red generator light comes on only after start up and turn over - during
the few seconds while the small amount of fuel is running out of the carb.
then the light is off, and the battery has nearly drained. dome light is
half-strength, no wipers, etc. can anybody lend a hand on this?   - steve
