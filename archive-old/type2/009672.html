I am looking for information on a really good body man in houston/texas 
area. I have aquired a 78 Double cab and it is in rough shape. I would love 
to get any leads on a Restoration type place. The local body guy that I know 
of does not have the time to take this project. I would try to do I my self 
but this project too big for me right now.  Any help would be great. Lano  
78 double cab
