Subject: 1600 upright in a '79 bus

fellas,

I bought a '79 Westfalia with a '67 1600 upright engine conversion.
Something I've noticed is when going up a hill around 55mph if I then floor
it the engine revs up considerably but the bus goes no faster.  I just
replaced the pressure plate and the clutch disc.  The transmission is from
the T4.  I learned this after I installed a T2 throw out bearing guide and
it was too long to work with the T4 trans.  Anyhow, I'm afraid that the old
T4 transmission is not working with the T2 engine as far as the clutch
interface (clutch seems to be slipping right?).  Anybody know anything about
this?  What differences are there between a T4 transmission and a T2
transmission?

Many thanks,
Christopher
1979 Westfalia
