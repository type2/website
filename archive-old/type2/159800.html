Subject: Rocky Mountain Colorado Bus Camping

Troy and I are trying to plan a little bus gathering amongst the 
Colorado Rockies.  At this stage we're trying to see who would be 
interested in a weekend camping in the mountains.  We have a couple of 
tentative dates and locations picked, but suggestions are welcome.

For all of the Colorado crew .. excuses won't be tolerated.  We know 
where you live.  Yes.  I am talking to you...Chris, Jon, Don, Bart and 
all the rest of you guys.  Resistance is futile!
