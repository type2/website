Mike, 

The drum only bolts to the hub one way, so I have always figured
that the hub and scallop counterbalance each other. OTOH, the
counterbalance could be internal to the hub..  I never really looked to
find out.  The scallop is necessary for replacing the brake shoes, at
least if you do it the way I do it, which is to assemble the shoes,
cross-bars, and springs, hook the parking brake cable onto its lever and
kind of wind the assembly into place.  There is one spot during the
process where the divot in the hub allows clearance on one of the brake
bits (I don't exactly remember, but remember it was necessary)

So, so you think you can tell

     Blue skys from pain.
  Can you tell a green field
    From a cold steel rail?
     A smile from a veil?
  Do you think you can tell?
