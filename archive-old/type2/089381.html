&gt; Greetings, List-
&gt;
&gt; I have noticed that it takes very firm pedal pressure to make my brake
&gt; lights come on. I have new pressure switches installed since putting 
&gt; the bus
&gt; on the road about a year ago. The brakes themselves work great- high 
&gt; pedal,
&gt; firm stopping power. It's just that the brake lights don't come on from
&gt; moderate pedal pressure; you know, the kind of pressure you use in 
&gt; traffic.

This problem arose with my bus about 2 months ago and it took me about 2 
hours to trace it to the pressure switches.   Since you have new 
pressure switches, I would say you might want
to go down there and clean off the contacts and see if that helps  You 
might want to clean the contacts on the console side of those wires as 
well, and make sure the connectors are good.  If that doesn't help, 
check the resistance across the wire from the switch into the car -- 
it's possible, but very unlikely, that the wires are starting to go.

The next step, albeit an annoying one, is to pull your senders and soak 
them in solvent.  Someone
recently suggested this to me as a way of cleaning out abused/dying 
senders, including brake senders.
I'd probably use acetone, and make sure you let them fully dry before 
you re-install them.

You might take this as a chance to flush your brake lines and use new 
fluid -- since you'll be leaking fluid when you pull the senders, right?

hope this helps,
