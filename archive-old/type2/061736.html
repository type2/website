Subject: Large VW van (Type 291?) sighting
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

At a junkyard in Stanton, Calif, I noticed a *very large* white van with two
logos
molded into the front grille.  A VW logo and the Peugeot &quot;rampant lion&quot;
logo.
Much of the hardware was very similar to late model busses and early V'gon.
There was a metal badge that had Type: 291CG... stamped into it, like the
badge with the Type2 VIN, Mcodes, etc  It also had a badge on the outside
with the letters [LT35 D].  A 8&quot; diameter speedo with Km units which has a
lock; the face of the speedo pulled down and there was a spot for a round
recording paper to be inserted.  Likely to record mileage/top speed while
this
vehicle was rented for a holiday journey?  It had a spacious cabinet/camping
arrangement built inside.  Taillamps were identical to late model busses.
Sorry to say this, but it was powered by a V8 M-Benz Diesel engine (water-
cooled); But I assume this might be of some interest to the VW transporter
enthusiasts around here.  I had never seen anything like it in N.America.

I've been scrounging around for a clock and a German AM/FM tape player.
The radios in the stores around here are DIN-1 which is too big for the slot
in the dashboard of my '73 bus.  I do not want to cut the dashboard at all.
A late model Type3 clock will not fit in a late model bus instrument cluster
without trimming the plastic housing.  I did buy a set of white M-Benz
hubcaps
for $20 so the trip to the junkyard was not a total loss.
