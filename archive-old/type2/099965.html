Subject: Re: [T2] Wiper doesn't wipe.

Hi Gary,

If it isn't the nut, then it's likely to  be worn splines. I have that 
problem with the p/s wiper on my Westfakia, discovering it suddenly in 
a rainstorm on my way back from EveryBus 2001

The good news is that a small shim between the wiper arm and the shaft 
will usually tighten things up enough to get the wiper moving again. 
This will keep you safe on the road until you can find and install a 
replacement wiper drive mechanism. I think we shimmed mine with a piece 
of a matchbook.

The shim is still holding fine almost 2 years later. I'll have to 
remember to buy a wiper mechanism next time I see one at a swap meet.

Happy trails,

&gt; Hi Gary,
&gt;
&gt; very good chance its the nut that hold the wiper arm onto the rotating 
&gt; spindle has worked loose. Just pop the plastic dome cover off and 
&gt; tighten with a 10mm spanner.
&gt;
&gt; If it's not that then possibly the splines are striped from the end of 
&gt; the spindle or in the arm in which case the 'offending' part needs to 
&gt; be replaced.
&gt;
&gt; Good luck

&gt;&gt; On the way home from work today I noticed that the passenger side 
&gt;&gt; windshield
&gt;&gt; wiper was only moving up and down about three inches.  Any tips on 
&gt;&gt; what may
&gt;&gt; be the cause/fix for this.
