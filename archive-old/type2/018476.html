I have to agree with George. I am a newbie to the list, as some of you
may
know. I personally think that a world wide member list would be a very
good
thing in the case of emergency and sheer desperation. If one of our
brothers
or sisters get in a really bad jam, we'll deal with it then, but till
then,
there may be a simpler fix. Beyond that, I know that most of the members
out
there have real jobs or are retired, I personally barely have a pot to
pi#$
in, and have a monthly or annual fee would be beyond budget. Don't hate
me
cause I'm poor! But, what do I know, really.

End of rant,
Nate
