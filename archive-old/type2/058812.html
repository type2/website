&gt;Well, I dunno how many listees went to Vanfest, but here's my unbiased report!
&gt;

Yes I was there, bloody great. Spent far too much on parts, but mostly a
good deal and stuff I'd never find otherwise. Tried to fix up for other
internet folks to meet on the Saturday but only one person Dan Maclean from
Scotland turned up. I see from usenet( RAMVA and the UK group) that Dave
Hall and GazMP also tried this Sunday but we never met. It wants properly
organising for next time, maybe to go in the program they hand out at the
entrance.

ps Individual Interiors now have remanufactured hinges for the Devon long
roof. These are not indentical to originals but look much stronger, and are
made of brass
