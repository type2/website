One of the biggest demands I get from overseas are for vent window
assemblies, both for the doors and the back glass. European delivery buses
(post 68) did not come with opening wing vents, thus the demand. I have
approx 3 sets left (I need to go look), but no 68 (one year only). I have
decided to stop selling my bay window parts to England and am starting to
warehouse those parts here now.

&gt; The 69 westy I sold to Nikki had fixed vent windows.Always thought it was
a
&gt; euro thing because as far as I could figure out it was a german delivery.

I think you're correct on that point, Chuck.

In Australia, the only Baywindow version that came out with opening vent 
windows, as far as I know, was the '76 deluxe ( as a result, most of us are 
trying to find the '76 opening vent windows for our other buses, I've been 
looking for a set for my '74 Campmobile since I got it, and I'll be soon
after 
another set if I pick up the '72 crewcab I've been asking about ).

Even the VW specialty shops don't have any luck sourcing vent windows here,
the 
guys I go to have tried ordering from the UK and everywhere else, without
much 
luck.
