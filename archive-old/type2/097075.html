Subject: Re:gas pedal squeaking/ breaking

TJ,
   You asked     &quot;my gas pedal is squeaking badly and it is getting
harder to push down now, it is not the acc cable as I have just
replaced that -- does anyone know  what could be going on???&quot;

Take up the rug or mat that's on the front floor of your bus.  I think
you'll find that a lot of dirt collects at the hinge located at the
base of the pedal.  I'd recommend you vacuum out all the dirt
collected there, inspect the hinge and repair it as necessary, and
then keep it well lubricated.  I believe that this is something that
should be on your list of routine maintenance items.  How often you do
it should be dictated by how you use your bus.
