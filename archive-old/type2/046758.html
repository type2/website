Subject: [T2] heater flap clamp missing

hi
i was going over my heating system on my '80 today and first noticed
that the right
(right is right, front is front) side flap has no clamp to the heater
box pipe.Anyone know where i can get one of these?
   Also, the right side flap doesn't open for some reason when it is in
place. i removed it and it came open fine when i turned the
lever, but back in place it still wouldn't budge. the lever is not hung
up on anything.  what a mystery!
