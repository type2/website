Subject: Key Code on '82 Vanagon
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I'm and idiot and need help, just lost my keys and
cant seem to turn up an extra after trashing the house
and dumping out all the junk drawers.  I know that
several people have found their key codes off the
sliding door, but that dosnt work for me since I have
a seperate key for my ignition.  So, is their anyway
to determine the code?  The ignition casing has
several numbers on it including a 9 digit numeric on
the top, and 3 different on the bottom, a 6 digit
numeric, SWF 3, and KLS 83 (hmmmm, if that is one of
them hope there isnt a car theif on the list).  Is
that one of the codes?  I am assuming not and that it
is actualy on the tumbler, which I cant get out.  Is
there away to get the tumbler out?  How about
hotwiring so I can get it to the mechanic who would
probably charge me less then a mobile lock smith?

Their are some numbers written in orange marker as
well on the casing, but I cant seem to make them out,
so if someone did have the forsight to record the
code, I am out of luck.

Any ideas greatly appreciated.

Nate
