Sounds like the Harrah's Automobile Collection in Reno.  Before Bill
Harrah died the collection (numbering in the hundreds, including an
example of every model of Deusenberg ever sold) was completely drivable.
It took two days to tour the entire collection.

After Harrah's death, the city of Reno was offered the entire collection
at a very reasonable price, but the idiots drug their feet so long that
most of the collection was sold off.  What remains today is a pale memory
of the original.

The original collection had a kubelwagen, schwimmwagen, and a WWII VW
staff car.
No buses, though Harrah would probably have gone for a barn if one came
into his sight.
