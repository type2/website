Dr. Tim:
    The hoses are all within a year or two old, as is everything except the
front drums, the front backing plates and the steel brake lines. I replaced
everything with parts from Bus Depot and bought OEM whenever possible (the
only exception being Varga rear wheel cylinders rather than their German
counter parts). I even had the brake &quot;specialists&quot; order the parts from B.D.
I have some reason to believe that they did not. They charged $125 per drum
whereas Ron has them for substantially less). While under the bus I did find
that the brake pedal stop had broken off and had been replaced with a
washer. The end result was that instead of having 1mm of clearance as per
Bentley, the pushrod was probably pushed in 3-5mm. This seems like it could
be a likely culprit for overheating brakes. Since my brakes were
overheating, I assume that this is the cause of the cylinder failure. Do you
think that I ought to replace all of the wheel cylinders and the master
cylinder?
As always your response/advice is greatly appreciated,
Jeff Mitchell

&gt;
&gt; When one cylinder goes, the whole system is contaminated. If the hoses are
&gt; old, they can swell shut and not allow the brake springs to pull the shoes
&gt; back. Are you using NAPA parts or OEM?
&gt;
&gt; If you open the bleed valve and a bit of fluid squirts out and the shoes
&gt; release, it is probably the hoses. Replace them, and know the MC and front
&gt; brakes will have weaknesses founded on the same contamination as well. Put
&gt; it all right and flush the fluid yearly to prevent contamination from
&gt; occuring again.
