Subject: Which Distributor?

Ok, time for some help deciding which distributor I really should have / get
as a replacement?

I have a 75 Westy (definitely) with a 2 L fuel injected engine (confirmed
when I rebuilt, at machine shop) which seems to run great at the 7.5 before
TDC.

The distributor (came with the bus) is a Bosh 0231170093, 022905205S. It is
a vacuum unit.

Seems from the chart I just looked at that this is for a 74 California auto,
or later vanagon?  http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/ovhignbo.htm

So which distributor is best for my bus (it has no smog gear installed -
don't need it where I live). I do have the 009 sitting here (from the
previous issue with the pertronix etc) and I do intend to install the
pertronix when I get a working unit!

Cheers,
Dave
