&gt; What do you think about using my existing tires up front?

I'd be cautious of running different stiffnesses of tires front and rear.
I've experienced some very strange handling when I did this.  It won't
hurt to try, but be prepared to switch the other two if there is a
problem.  I took the best of my old tires for a spare when I went to the
proper tires, and it served fine until the next time I replaced tires.

&gt; Just trying to figure out what to do with the nearly new set of four that
&gt; are on there now.
&gt; Also wondering if I have a case to take to the tire place.  Did they
&gt; technically sell  the wrong tires? Thanks

Technically, they did.  However, how far you can get with this is not
definite.  All you can do is go talk to them, but in most cases the tire
salesmen are not terribly qualified to select the proper tires for a
vehicle, particularly a small size/high load application such as a bus.
Usually they look at the tires on the vehicle and replace with the same
size.  If you had passenger tires before, they'll install new passenger
tires.
