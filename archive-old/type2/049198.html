The BA6 would be your best option.  The archives and library at
www.type2_dot_com has an article on installing a BA6.  Heating the van is a
common thread, so search the archives on BA6 and BN4, heater et cetera.

The BA6 was on Vans from 1974 through 1984 (they were on Vanogon's too -- so
you can pull a system out of of a Vanogon in the wrecking yard).  Take the
time to find a BA6 if you don't want to put something in the engine bay.

The BA6 is inline, under the Van, so your second battery is not a problem.
Make sure you research the job well, and are familiar with all the parts
located throughout the bus.  Its not too hard to deal with, but you do need
to pull some stuff from the cab, as well as the stuff underneath, and you
want to know how to diagnose if its working properly before you take it
home.

you can find an on-line manual for the BA6 here:

I can't imagine putting a gas heater under the back seat would be a good
idea.

Subject: [T2] gas heater questions


I am new to the VW scene, having just bought my first
bus this spring.  Now I am looking to put a gas heater
in my bus, but I'm not sure what type of heater to
use.  I have a dual battery kit that I really don't
want to do away with, so the BN4 in the engine
compartment isn't really an option, and the archives
don't mention much about other mounting methods. ...
