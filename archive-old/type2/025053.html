I like the location of the filler on my '93 EV.  This is the only vehicle I
know of where I can fill it up myself without ever getting out of the van.  A
while back when the temps were in the single digits I was able to fill up at a
pay at the pump while staying inside the van and out of the cold.  Just pull
up close to the pump and lower the window.
