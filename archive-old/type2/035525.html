&gt;Today's guru was yesterday's
&gt;&quot;Can I drive on two cylinders?&quot; poster.
&gt;              - Mark Hineline

teehee! i took the retro dance club out today, but before i hit route 32 
(minimum speed limit= 70mph at night, during a blizzard) i decided to take a 
spin around base...the 'club seemed sooo gutless, balky and wanted to 
backfire everyso often (not major backfire...like my mother of all 
backfires, done on my ghia, at night, i saw a flame shoot out of one of the 
tail pipes that stretched 30-40 feet -the flame,not the pipe-) but bad 
enough to be noticed...i came back to the barracks and started pulling plug 
wires to see where i had a problem- i had been running on cyls 1 and 2 only! 
i think ive got the problem fixed though...the 'club seems to be running a 
bit better...ill take another spin and then hit 32...
wish me luck :)
