Subject: Re: [T2] jacking the bus

I think that's the same jack I bought a while back.  It gets it up  plenty high.  Very heavy-duty jack too.  It will lift my  (close to) 6000 lb. Jaguars.    Nah, I just went and  looked. Mine is only a 3 ton jack.  But it works great. That  is a good deal! Cheers...KR

Anyone know if a 3.5 ton floor jack with a lift range of 5.5 to 19.75 inches
is good for the using the rear torsion tube as a jack point? Will it be high
enough to get the wheels off the ground?
Sears has this jack, two stands and a creeper on sale for $100:
