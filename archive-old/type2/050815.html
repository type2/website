&gt;Anybody have any strong opinion about the above group (or somebody I
&gt;missed) pro or con?

I have used AA Transaxle in Duvall, WA. One man show, knows his trannys,
does only VW/Audi/Porsche, uses only German parts. Highly recommended.
Also, I believe he has a 3 year warrenty. Warrentys are typically short
because not all tranys are treated nicely. Some people have teen drivers
that must simply burn rubber, even if they are driving a bus. 

Also, some DIY'ers are cautious, careful and exacting, others are idiots.
You need no written warrenty when dealing with reputable people. Darrel at
AA Transaxle is one who can be trusted to do a proper piece of work.
