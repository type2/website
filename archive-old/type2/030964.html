yeah they are scary, enough to give one a nervous breakdown

&gt; AVP didn't give a break-in procedure, so  I'm hoping this is ok.

Here is what I was taught and has served me well.

.  fire it up, let it run at various rpm for 15-20 minutes,
    Change the oil and filter
.  drive it 100 miles
    change the oil and filter
.  drive it 200 miles 
    Change the oil and filter, check everything
.  drive it 1,000 miles
    Change the oil and filter, do full tune up
.  drive it 2,000 miles (total 3,300miles)
    Change the oil and filter, do full tune up, put in synthetic oil

go to your normal Preventive Maintenence schedule

(synthetic oil is personal choice but not during break in period, it
lubricates Too well and the cyl do not hone themselves in)
