Volk-a-maniacs,

Once again, I draw upon the combined experience and knowledge of you all to
confirm/deny/assist my latest woe. I have an intermittent non-fire of the
ignition system. I put key in, turn half way to see all the pretty little
lights and the other half to fire up the starter/engine. The second half is
where I am not getting anything to happen.

GNS.WAGNON: 

Sounds like you are expiring the random loss of amperage through old wiring scenario.  Remember that there is a lot of wire between the ignition switch to the starter and back.  A typical solution is to install a WR-1 starter relay kit, or do what I did and grabbed a standard hella 4 pole 30 amp relay and wired it between the starter and and battery.  That way your key is only powering the relay which is using a heavy gauge wire from the battery to the relay and starter. Eliminated all of my random not starting problems.  You can google the wr-1 relay and get the wiring procedures and diagram....
