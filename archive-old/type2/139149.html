&gt; I am seriously considering splitting my case, cleaning the sealant(s)

&gt; conditions. Better now than after the engine is all together, if it
&gt; should leak. I'm concerned about the plug because of the anaerobic
&gt; character of the sealant. There is a lot of clearance between that plug
&gt; and the case (judging from the amount of dried sealant I cleaned up
&gt; before. I'm a little worried that the Loctite might never cure there.

The data sheet says it's designed for clearances up to 0.25mm.
