Subject: Heater Air routing 

Okay, can someone tell me how the heater air and fresh air is routed behind
the kick plate. 

I know that the heat comes from the engine and through the long tube where a
portion can be routed to the rear floor vent. The rest of the air goes over
the front axle and up the tube up front where I have a lever. What does this
lever do? Where does the air go past this point? Are the fresh air vents a
totally different disconnected system of ducts?

Steve
