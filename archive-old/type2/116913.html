Subject: Seat to floor bolts for a 72

Clear DayAnyone know where I can find the bolts that hold down the rear seat
in a regular bus or a westy? They are the ones that a re kind of t-shaped
and slide into a slotted bracket on the floor in the rear. There are 2 of
them. Mine are rusted bad. I've looked through a few catalog's and websites
and can't seem to find them. My local hardware store didnt have any.

Thanks,
Dave
