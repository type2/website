Subject: Re: [T2] STABILAZER LINK ??  HELP

Use grease to make it slide easier.  Place the bushing
on the stabilizer bar first.  Then grease the link. 
Bend in part of the lip of the bushing inside the link
and press the rest on.  Push it on a little extra, and
the rest of the lip will pop back out.

&gt; Happy Friday Everyone !!
&gt; Okay so I have an 80 westy that came without the
&gt; driver side stablizer link or bushings.  I got all
&gt; parts but can't seem to get the lower bushing
&gt; thought the little hole.  Any body have any
&gt; suggetions on how to get it in.  Any help on the top
&gt; one would be great as well. Also should these
&gt; questions (body front end ect..) go to the vanagon
&gt; list or type 2 because it is air cooled? Hoping to
&gt; take it on its first camping trip this weekend about
&gt; 50 miles away. :)
&gt; Thanks
