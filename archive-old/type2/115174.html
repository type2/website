Subject: Re: [T2] Help! 68 Brake lights

Matt,

Intermittents are hard to find.

You might want to try the following:
1 Key on

2 Turn on the Emergency Flasher Control

3 See if you can start the Emergency Flasher running by moving the wires 
near the Turn Signal and Flasher Relay. If it starts, what wire is 
responsible?

I know you are more concerned with the brake lights than the Emergency 
Flasher but they are interrelated.

4 Check to see if Fuse S9 is well seated. This supplies voltage to the 
Flasher Relay.

Do you have a volt/ohm meter?

Chuck




&gt;My camper has nine terminals on the flasher unit. After returning to the
&gt;shop to complete my inspection, I found that the brake lights stopped
&gt;working again.
