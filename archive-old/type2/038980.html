congratulations, you don't say what engine they put in but this is pretty
generic. when I rebuilt my type IV last summer this is how I was taught

(remember no valve adjust as it is hyd, and I have an oil filter)

using a good quality 10W-40 multi weight oil
for the first 1,000 miles do not drive at a constant speed and try not to
pull any really tough hills or overly high RPMs.

. turn on engine, run for 2-3 minutes,
drain oil' change and filter
. turn on engine, run at different RPMs for 15 minutes (no drive)
change oil and filter
. 100 miles 
change oil and filter
. 300 miles 
change oil and filter
. 1000 miles
change oil and filter, check head bolts (set valves)
. 2000 more miles 
change oil and filter put in 5W-50 synthetic motor oil, full tune up

go to my regular maintenence routine


my routine and it is pretty much standard

enjoy your wheels

&gt; article at the Type 2 library. The shop doing the work is about 75 miles 
&gt; away. On my return trip, if I take the quickest and straightest route, it 
&gt; would be about 8-10 miles of stop and go city traffic, 55 miles of 
&gt; interstate, then about 7 miles of stop and go again. Should I just drive it 
&gt; normally? Should I drive normally but just not push it past 55 or so on the 
&gt; interstate? I also have the option of taking a longer route that's more rural 
&gt; which would allow me to take my time and go nice and slow. Is this needed? 
&gt; The mechanic told me I should drive it like I normally would, just be sure 
&gt; and do the oil changes on time  and make sure I have valves set at 600 miles. 
&gt; This approach seems too easy.
&gt; Looking forward to some responses.
