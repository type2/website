Subject: RE: [T2] tranny whine

&gt;&gt;&gt;Did you replace the coupler with the &quot;upgraded&quot; polyeurothane (sp?)
coupler or the cheap rubber one.  I can tell you from experience that
the cheap rubber ones shifts just as well and does NOT transfer nearly
as much noise from the tranny through the linkage and into your interior.

&gt;&gt;mike - i didn't dive into it much. i fig'd coupler is coupler. my memory
tells it was opaque so i'm going to suppose it was poly. seriously, coupler
= noise? can you elaborate please.  - steve

&gt;The poly coupler is much harder than the stock rubber one - more like a hard
plastic block.  The rubber acts as a dampener (both for noise and vibration)
whereas the plastic one will transmit all that noise and vibration from your
tranny along the shift linkage and right up the gear shift lever itself.

i see. that helps. the tranny has low mileage relative to its life
expectancy.  there was no noise before the new coupler install.  the only
thing left is i thought my poly coupler was cheap ($6 ) - steve
