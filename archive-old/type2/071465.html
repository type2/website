I would go over the motor visually, check and feel each hose and make sure 
the connections are airtight, check the integrity of your hose clamps - use 
only your best. then make sure the main brain plug is seated in it's holster, 
another one to miss is the 9 pronger on the air flow meter, is it seated 
tight? Then each mpc connector on the injectors and especially the thermo 
time, cold start, &amp; aux air connector, then the harness ground wires to the 
block and the resistor and double relay plug. make sure the fuel line isn't 
kinked, the four fat intake air vacum hoses should be well-clamped. Of course 
the distributor wires should all be in the right order, the points &amp; plugs 
well-gapped, valves set etc. Is there gas in the tank? 
Ultimately you might just replace the air flow meter with an understudy, 
jiggle some wires and the thing will roar to life and drive happily for 40k. 
I hope so anyway.
