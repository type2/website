&gt;This is another F.A.R.T. that could be researched in the archives at

&gt;the &gt;valves be too loose than too tight.

I was a bit hasty in this post - what I should have said was that the
subject of how many turns to set your hydraulic lifters is a F.A.R.T..  I
will give the barely-running issue my best shot:

If the engine runs fine at 3/4 turn in and will barely run at 2 turns in,
that tells me that you are really more turns in than you think.  The
lifters have probably bottomed out and the valves are not closing all the
way.  This is easily verifiable by a compression test.

I wouldn't be juming to this conclusion if it hadn't happened to me
already.  If there is any air in the lifter, it will begin to compress very
easily.  What will happen is that when you are tightening the adjusting
screw, trying to feel the point of first resistance, you are already past
it and turning through the part of the lifter's range that is filled with
air.  When you hit the oil, you feel a lot of resistance and crank it down
two more turns, which is &quot;past&quot; the end of the lifter's adjustment range,
and voila, negative clearance (the valve never shuts), little or no
compression, barely runs.

You have to be very careful determining when the lifter starts to compress.
The method I use now is to turn the adjuster in until I feel real (oil)
resistance, then back off slowly while watching the pushrod.  The spring
inside the lifter will push the pushrod out as you loosen the adjuster (Use
one hand to ever so gently push the pushrod towards the lifter to prevent
the pushrod from being pulled out by the rocker arm - if it is oily the
rocker arm will want to stick to the end of the pushrod).  At the point
where you loosen the adjuster and the pushrod does not come out anymore,
you have found the point at which you need to start your turn-in.  If you
play with it a little, you might be able to feel the point at which the
spring in the lifter starts to compress.  If there is air in the lifter,
the difference in resistance of the adjusting screw will be hard to detect
on it's own, as the spring in the lifter is not that strong, at least not
against the mechanical advantage of the adjusting screw.

So say there is some air in the lifters and you adjust to 3/4 turn in.
It's likely that you are still in the range of the lifter that is filled
with air, and as a result there will be some clearance in the valves when
you start the engine.  It will be noisy.  Don't despair - run the engine at
fast idle or drive slowly around your neighborhood until the noise goes
away - it could take up to 15 minutes.  On the off chance that the noise
doesn't go away, you either have a bad lifter or you misjudged the point at
which the lifter starts to compress.
