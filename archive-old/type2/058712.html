Subject: Parts sources?

Northern Virginia listees:

I have fallen heir to my daughter's 71 Westy's troubles.  She purchased
it within the last month and PO did lots of his own wiring
modifications.  While trying to straighten things out and get her on the
road legally we're having a hard time finding assorted parts.  I can't
find an area salvage yard with any buses older than 73.  We need lots of
little things and I'd like to be able to just pull what I need or might
need soon from a donor bus or buses.  

Does anyone from VA/MD/DC area know of any good parts sources (new or
used) locally?  She is a college student and of limited resources, so
used is better.

TIA for any and all help. 

Karen
