Subject: Re: [T2] Frequent Frustration with a Reluctant Relay

Hiya Blake,

I had the same sort of symptoms (dash lights on for a blink - then out, 
outside blinking OK, dash lights on with emergency hazard switch) with the blinker 
relay (215C) in the Duck recently.  This was after the Duck had sat for about 
six months in the garage and the battery had drained down.
As soon as I replaced the battery the symptoms vanished.  All works as it 
should now.  So..... it may be possible that a voltage drop in the lines (or 
connections), or a bad ground (there's that mysterious brown wire!) could be 
causing your problems.
