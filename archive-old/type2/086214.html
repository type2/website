Subject: '78 paint codes

Hello List,

I'm taking a '78 Sagegreen Westfalia (Vegas Bus) to the body/paint shop 
tomorrow and I need to know the paint code for the rims and &quot;U&quot; shaped 
slider hinge (siler-gray) and also the paint code for the bumpers (white). 
Also, how are the new bumpers quality wise?

Thanks,
Brandt

'78 Sagegreen Westy (Vegas Bus)
'79 Sagegreen Westy (Rusty Bus)
'99 Jetta
