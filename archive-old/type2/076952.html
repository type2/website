Subject: Westy Interior Advice

	I have come across a 75 westy that a guy here wants 1000 for w/ the
tranny &amp; engine, but said he will take 300 for the body/interior minus
the engine/tranny. Seem a decent deal to me since the front seats are
much better than my 79's 7-passenger. Anyone have any suggestions on
what to look at closely that could make the investment much riskier
than normal. (i.e., expensive things on westy's that will go out, etc)
