Subject: Dear Sirs,

I am the founder of a Volkswagen collectors group called AIRS, the Aircooled
Interstate Rescue Squad.  All of our members are collectors and drivers of
classic Volkswagen busses, beetles, and other models.

Our members travel and camp in many campgrounds all over the country.  Many
of our members are professionals in various fields and use this hobby as a
way to relax.  Many of them also live in Virginia, North Carolina, and
Tennessee.

We have been informed by one of our members that during a recent visit to
your campground you brandished a gun and implied his business was not
welcome at your place of business.  The customer you turned away had driven
all day and was quite tired when he found your park.  He was on his
vacation.

As Volkswagen bus collectors and owners, the members of AIRS are very
insulted by your actions and poor judgement.  We are sending out a letter to
all 900 of our members, national and international, to let them know of the
incident.  We are including the name of your campground, the location, and
the details as told to us.

We are also filing an official complaint with AAA, Good Sam, and the
Virginia Attorney General's office.

Thanks, and have a good day.

Charlie Ford
