Subject: Hydraulic valves or solid?

Hi all,
In the ongoing sourcing of parts for my re-build, I have the option to get
hydraulic lifters/cam followers or solid ones. (the motor has solid lifters
currently).
So are there any advantages either way in terms of reliability/longevity?
I assume it is a straight swap of the cam follower to convert to hydraulic
lifters?

Obviously the lower maintenance of hydraulic lifters is desirable, but if
solid are more reliable I will go that way.

Oh, the motor is a stock '77 2L dual carb type 4 motor, solid lifters as
standard.

Regards,
Richard
