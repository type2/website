Subject: RE: [T2] Seals again

&gt;   I have Genuine VW/AUDI packaged outer scrapers and also inner
&gt; scrapers. My front door seals are imported from Germany and are made by
the same
&gt; company that makes the rear hatch seals...
&gt;
&gt;    I have not ventured into the later 68-79 type 2 bus market as
&gt; availability on a lot of products was questionable and the pre 68
&gt; market has kept me quite busy.


Ronnie,
So, are you saying that you have those parts for '68-79, or for pre-68?
