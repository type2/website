Subject: RE: [T2] windshield seal

&gt; I see that two windshield seals are available. One is Genuine VW 
&gt; Brazil and another one twice the price is German OEM.
&gt; What's the difference and which one is better?

&gt; Well, I bought the genuine VW seal from Bus Depot which at 
&gt; $19.95 I am assuming that it was Brazilian. I found a local 
&gt; VW shop that had NOS VW Bus windshields and had them install 
&gt; the new seal with the windshield. It looked good but leaked 
&gt; worse than with the old seal. I had to take it back and they 
&gt; used  butyl rubber around the lower half of the seal, glass 
&gt; and body side, and havn't had a leak yet. So, I couldn't tell 
&gt; you what the difference is between the two but as usual the 
&gt; Brazilian stuff just doesn't quite fit perfect. I'd say go 
&gt; with the German OEM.


The genuine VW/Brazil ones fit correctly and definitely do not leak when
properly installed on a bus with no windshield channel rust. We've sold
thousands of them. They are the same seals used on brand new Mexican VW
bus production, so you can be assured they do fit perfectly. 

However, it can be tricky to install a windshield in a bus. I always pay
a glass place to do it because it can be challenging to get the seal
(any brand) to sit right all around the lip. (Not to mention the risk of
breakage!)  Even the tiniest gap anywhere can cause a leak. Also, many
busses have rust below the windshield, which, if not fixed, can also
cause a leak. Very likely the seal was just not quite seated properly
somewhere along the windshield channel - just a hair off. When the
garage removed and reinstalled the windshield again, they probably got
it seated better, so the leak went away. Since you were having a
problem, they were probably much more careful and in tune with any tiny
abnormality when they installed it the second time.

When you think about it logically, which is more believable - that
VW/Mexico for 20 years has been putting windshield seals on their new
Kombi's that don't fit, or that there was something about the way the
seal was seated on your particular windshield frame that caused it to
continue to leak like the old one had? 

For what it's worth, many of the bus seals sold as German VW are
actually sourced from VW/Brazil and simply repackaged in Germany anyway.
I have seen more than one case where identical seals were in the same
shipment, some in VW/Germany boxes and some in VW/Brazil boxes. Rear
hatch seals are one example. So I am reluctant to refer to seals as
German VW unless I'm sure, since in many cases they are just repackaged
VW/Brazil seals despite the labeling. But you pay more because you're
paying to have your seal shipped from Brazil to Germany to the U.S.,
with everyone marking it up along the way. I can't say for sure that
this is the case with windshield seals but it certainly would not shock
me.  So while we can get &quot;German&quot; seals, I can't justify the extra price
given that the VW/Brazil ones have the correct OEM fit and cost a third
the price.  (The same cannot be said about many of the aftermarket
Brazilian/Mexican seals out there, however.)
