Subject: Re: hydraulic lifter adjustments

Thanks to all the listees who offered the great advice on this
problem!  To recap, I had inspected the hydraulic lifters of my '79 CA
Westy.  Once everything was back together and the lifters were adjusted
according to Bently, the bus would not start.

Most of the folks who responded recommended that I ease off on the valve
adjustments (ie: one turn or 3/4 turn instead of two.)  If the screw is 
adjusted to tight, the valves will stay open.

The other piece of advice was: keep cranking the engine to allow the
lifters to bleed down.

I followed the advice, and it worked like a charm!  Now the engine is
idling a bit slow and the throttle adjust screw doesn't seem to do much...
ah well, another adventure.

Thanks again to everyone!
