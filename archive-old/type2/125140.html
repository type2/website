Subject: Fuel pump question

I was under my bus the other day after a recent engine replacement and
noticed that the fuel pump was apparently in place, but my older engine had
an after-market electric fuel pump and the mech carried it over to the new
(used) engine.

I've been considering whether I should go back to using the stock fuel pump.
It's probably safer than the electric at this point (I need to rewire the
electric pump with a relay kit [I know that this is an imperative job,
please, no flames).

The stock pump has both lines crimped closed.  Would it be better to rebuild
it, or should it be replaced completely if I go for the conversion back to
the stock pump?  Should I stay with the electric pump and make it safe with
the relay kit?
