Subject: Hawaii is breaking my heart...

So I am out here on O'ahu on business for a few days, and living at my
mothers house in Wai'anae - the town I grew up in and went to school at.

I was bored stiff today since my Zoey is currently 4k miles away or so and
decided to do a little driving around just to see how the place has changed
and revisit some familiar places. Bare in mind that the Wai'anae Coast is a
poor area in Hawaii and it is not uncommon to find shytloads of salvage cars
in peoples yards - including city buses.

As I drove around the areas of Makaha, Ma'ili, and Nanakuli, I counted no
lest than 10 buses (mostly Bays) that were sitting in weeds, rusted and
basically looking very unhappy. I honestly felt like a kid in a candy store
with not a dime to my name! I kept thinking about what Chris at Busted Bus
does and just saw all these buses wishing I could get my hands on them and
part them out for folks.

What can I say, it just broke my heart.

The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who
acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door, and deny Him by
their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds
unbelievable.
