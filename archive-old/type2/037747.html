Hey man. 
Okay you asked about how I solved my icing problem.
Well to start out my single carb obly had one of thise small &quot;exposed&quot; type air filters. I knew this would not due when it got cold. So what my mechanic did at the time was make a plat that bolted to the carb that had attached to it an air filter from I think a ford escort (dont laugh people)ANYWAY I think any SMALL oval basic air filter unit you can modify and secure to your carb will do. At this point you have &quot;isolated&quot; your air intake from a single source i.e. a hose...

Now

looking at your engine there should be two air ducts on either side inside the engine compartment. What I did is buy a hose that I could place on one or both air ducts (both by using a &quot;T&quot; connector). if you use one make sure the other is pluged up AND you have your engine seals and all the tin around the engine. This ensures it (the engine) stays cooler in the summer by only sucking the cooling air fromthe upper vents and NOT from rite off the engine and muffler. if you can see the ground from inside the engine compartment I woulnt not drive it till you have engine seals. 

I digress...sorry

What I do in the summer is remove one or more air intake tubes from the vent(s) on the engine and place the tube in the round air intake behind the battery and make sure to seal off the &quot;holes&quot;. I do this to prevent vaper lock. I only do this when summer is in full swing and its hot and I am on a longer trip.

All I am saying and I hope it made sense, is try to rig an air filter to the carb, when that is done connect the hose to a hot air vent found on either side of the engine INSIDE the engine compartment. 

I just remembered that you said you did not have heat exchangers...May I ask how I you did that? I want to REMOVE mine but dont know how to get a muffler and exhaust system set up without them. Crap, that means you may not have those hot air vents on the inside of the engine compartment..hmmm I think I am stumped at this point..

Well I hope you all out there are not shaking your heads..I am open to anybody can let me know if I am wrecking my car with my set up!!!!

Peace!
Andrew
