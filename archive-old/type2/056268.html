Subject: 1980 Basic Camper (P22) water/battery level panel problem

Whew, that was a long subject, but I couldn't think of a way to shorten it.

My problem is that when the water/battery level indicator panel is connected to the wiring system (PO had it detached when I bought it), it is constantly on without the key in the ignition.  Now, I've seen a deluxe camper from 1981 that had a little on/off toggle switch, but my basic camper panel has no such switch.  My camper has no propane accessories, but the panel has the &quot;pilot light&quot; LED in the middle.

I've checked the Bentley wiring diagrams.  It shows only the deluxe setup with toggle switch.  This leads me to believe that the P22 panel should only receive voltage after the alternator takes over power production.  Anybody have a clue? 

It is tough to work this all out because the van did not come with a manual for the camping accessories.  Assuming that VW included one, does anybody out there have an original manual for the Westfalia accessories (preferably with reference to the different P22 basic camper accessories - icebox, PANEL, etc.)?  I would pay all costs necessary if anyone has the original or a copy they can send.

Thanks,

John
