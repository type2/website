list - glad to report the 68 is nearly road ready. just minor tweeking now.
all the hurdles put before me are behind and i can concentrate on the
smoothness of the ride and the fweem. this double cab of mine was a
dumpster two months ago. now it is on a new path, and for that i am
grateful to this list; especially those guys who came on board to help
early and stayed with me to the end with encouragement, or advise, and in
some cases both.

there is still the matter of turn signals and emergency flashers and
reverse lights. at the same time i'd like to get opinions on a certain
tweak; which is, after it idles at a stop and gets shifted into gear, a
shot of gas becomes a catalyst for stalling, and it cuts out. i see it as
either a bit o'crud in the main or idle jet, or more probably a vacuum
leak. evidence of the latter is shown by seeing carbon where the heat
exchanger meets the muffler. it came with a splurt of water on intital
start up. i had to take the muffler off a few times to get the engine
carrier on, and another reason that for the sake of sanity has been blocked
out. should i change out these relatively brand new gaskets first? any
other options for this please?

- steve
