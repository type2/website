Subject: [T2] 71 parts

Gentlepersons-
                      Step right up...What we got here is/are some parts from 
a '71 Trans-
porter. Front doors - better than yours if yours are dented, but rusty at the 
bottom.
Some interior bench seats - best described as rebuildable, but usable. Side 
glass, etc.
No mechanicals.
                      What I'm looking for: OK, multi-marqued owners, this is 
for you; Triumph
TR 2-3-4-6 wire wheel adapters...Need an axle set-one left, one right. Got an 
old TR?
Know someone with an old TR? Just the adapters...Already have wheels and 
knock offs,
although if the deal is right, I'm interested in those too. 
                      Will trade up/down for the TR parts (needed for a 
Morgan restoration -
those familiar with Morgan will understand the TR connection;-)
                      Also looking for rear bumper for '71 Transporter- 
smooth bumper '68 -
to '72 (I think...) surface rust, small dents OK, with mounts/without.
                      Parts located in northern NJ (think Newark as 
geographical nexus), so
consider your location vis-a-vis mine for parts availability...Shipping would 
cancel big
parts value, if you know what I mean
                      All I want for Christmas is my two adapters...
