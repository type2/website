  &gt; now one thing I am getting numb about, can't find the static timing
&gt; prochedures for setting the timing, always used the light while running
&gt; but hard to do when you can't get it running.

timing shouldn't be a problem.  It will run rough but still run 
consistently.

Did you try testing the wiring harness and also change out the spark 
plug wires?

Something is strange about the fact that it runs 5 minutes and then 
dies.  Did you check if you still had good spark after it died?  Did you 
try starter fluid after it died?  If, after it died and starter fluid 
doesn't get it running again, I'd venture to guess the problem is an 
intermittent spark problem..

let's see if we can narrow things down.  Get it running and find out 
what caused it to stop - I think that's your biggest clue.
