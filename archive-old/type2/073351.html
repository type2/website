my aunt and uncle owned a Sage Green '78 Westy. they bought it new, and
drove it to texas from new york. live there a few years, then drove to
toronto. lived there for a few, then took her to Montreal, where they lived
for a while. when they moved back to the states, they sold her to someone
in [or near] montreal for next to nothing. the Bus's name was Lucy, and she
was always in perfect condition.

anyway, this is a longshot, but if you happened to be the person who bought
her, get in touch with me. just wondering if yer out there...

that bus was the reason i decided to get my own.
