There certainly isn't a good enough reason to pull the engine and change
them.  The main reason not to stack several shims is to lessen the chance
of oil leaks.  All it takes is one crumb of dirt between any one of the
spacers to cause a leak.  If you have no leaks there now, then no harm no
foul.  Personally I would pay to have the spacers shipped next day rather
than take the chance, but that's just me.  I didn't mean to offend you or
your mechanic.
