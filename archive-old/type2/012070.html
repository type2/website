Subject: how to install surfracks
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

hi list. does anyone know how to install surfracks
inside a bus? i'm a longboarder and would like to keep
my board inside. i've seen a few buses with racks on
the inside, is there a kit i can just buy or is this a
homemade deal? 

thanks,
tesa
