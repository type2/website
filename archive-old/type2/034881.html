&gt;  Does anyone have any suggestions for installing curtains in my bus? The
PO had a really &gt;unprofessional/cheesey looking curtain set-up I promptly
removed. Thanks!

I used shock cord, (the stuff bungee cords are made of).
You can find it in bulk at hardware stores.
I just stretched it above and below the windows and threaded it
through a wide hem in some homemade curtains.
I also stretched a piece above and behind the front seats to block the front
and just let the bottom hang free.
