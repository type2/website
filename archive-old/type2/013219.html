Try www.MOFOCO_dot_com, about $1500.00 for complete type IV rebuilt engine,
no core required. They can also give you cam, head, lifter options.

I seriously doubt that you could build one cheaper with the new oil pump,
cam gears, heads, lifters, cylinders, pistons etc.

If you current motor isn't cratered It can be used as an exchange and you
can get an engine with new heads and all of the whistles and bells you
want for less than $1500.00

I'm not an engine machinest and I always wonder what I've gotten back
after getting my parts back from seven different shops that have
performed various services.

I don't want to hear a bunch of crap back from list members about Mofoco.
I'm just quoting their catalog price.

The only warning I have is check your crank before you send it as an
exchange. Rebuilders are guilty of shipping you back a 10-10  or worse
crank insead of your good standard crank.
