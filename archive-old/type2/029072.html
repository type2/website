&quot;How would he find out what the correct rear bumper for a 72 sunroof bus
is?&quot;

The bumper is the same from 1968 to 1972, it's the bumper mounting arms that
are different, for some reason vw wanted to put a bigger motor in and
eliminate the removable rear engine valance!

And yes, this is another 1 year only part for a 72, how many one year only
parts for a 72 can you come with?
How many last year parts?
How many first year parts?
