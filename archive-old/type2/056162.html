to any one who can help me! my 72 westy has a problem in her shift pattern
often when we try to put it in first, it will seem to go until you let the
clutch and it feels as if it is in third or second, ir not a starting gear. I
am trying to fix it or just find something that will give me a diagram of how
it is made up. if you know of a source e-mail me at  &quot;littlelode_at_juno_dot_com&quot;
thanks david
