Subject: Re: [T2] A SHORT SURVEY

Barry,

A &quot;short&quot; would be described as any electrical connection that
goes where it shouldn't.  

For instance, a brake light wire that rubs on the chasis and blows
a fuse because the electricity tries to go straight back to the
ground wire on the battery rather than through the brake light bulb
first.

A &quot;short&quot; might be correctly diagnosed by blown fuses or melted wires!

Or warning lights coming on when they are not supposed to...as if your
oil pressure warning light wire had rubbed thru the coating and 
occasionally made a connection with the chasis.

Cheers, dave

&gt; 
&gt; Could everyone do a 'short' survey and let me know p-mail, off line.
&gt; 
&gt; Please check your type 2 and let me know if you see a SHORT in your system, 
&gt; or if you have a SHORT-FREE type 2.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, is there any guru out there that wants to speak up and describe how 
&gt; someone would know if they have a short in one of their electrical circuits.
