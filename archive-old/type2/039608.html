Subject: New oil -&gt; Old oil

I replaced my pushrod tube seals last night.  I want to give you just part 
of the full story, so I can ask the question, &quot;what's up??&quot; Here goes...

Last month, I changed the oil / filter, 1,000 miles ago.

During the previous weekend, I suddenly developed a major oil leak, which 
was just about 50-70 miles ago.  I lost oil at the rate of one quart/50 
miles.  Westy was put to bed the very next day, pending prognosis.

Yesterday, during the pushrod tube seal replacement, I checked the oil on 
the dipstick, and the oil was as clear and pure as new olive oil.  
Transparent.  Same color since I changed the oil last month.

After the PRT seal replacement, I removed the oil filter.  Oil in the oil 
filter was BLACK!!  I put on a new oil filter, and I added oil as 
appropriate.

This morning, I had an easy drive in to work, just 13 miles.

I checked the oil during lunch, and the oil is DARK, not clear and 
transparent.  (Note:  the oil in the pushrods themselves was BLACK.  I did 
not drain the pushrods.  I guess I should have, though.)

What happened??  If my oil did not change color over 1,000 miles, how is it 
that it changed color to DARK in just 13 miles today??

Where was this oil hiding??  Did I have something blocking my oil flow??  
(The engine ran smooth, as always, no lifter noise, etc..)
