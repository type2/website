Subject: Clicking in dashboard while attempting to start?

Greetings!

In trying to start my bus (76 2L with carbs), I hear a clicking sound 
coming from behind the dashboard. The starter is engaging, the engine 
turns over, but the engine is not firing. We've gotten a lot of rain 
here lately, and I've had a little leakage appearing on the floor under 
the steering wheel. Is it a short? If so, what might I be looking for?
