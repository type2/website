Subject: Need Some Options on Carbs

hey now,

i'm tired of the single weber carb on my '74 1800cc bus. didn't the 74 have
dual carbs as stock? i believe mine was changed by a FPO. i'm not getting good
gas milage (16-18mpg) on an rebuilt engine with about 800 miles. i know i'm
not gonna get great milage on the rebuild...but what should i expect?

everything is timed and accurate, valves set to .006, carb set correctly, new
points, etc etc. i've never got good milage on this van. even before the
rebuild.

it is my understanding that with dual carbs i'll get better milage and more
power. how much, i'm not sure. so, should i go to dual or try a different
single carb...or does mine need rebuilding?

thanks,

jonathan '74 Retrowestie (Ru/\/\ba)
