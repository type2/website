Subject: Loctite 574 for case hardware?
Message-ID: &lt;005201beb6df$89d2ac00$728166ce_at_default&gt;

Well I've waited against all my emotions to put the bottom end of my T4
together on the rec to get Loctite 574 (Orange) for the splitline.  Rec was
&gt;from numerous Porsche folk whom I trust quite a bit and in a quick net
review seems also backed by a number of better rebuilders across the www.
So tomorrow I go get the tube I ordered at the local bearing and power
transmission place, $13 for a 50 ml tube for anyone interested (note
Automotion wants $25 for the same, and I'm not getting a particularly good
price as they used to give me 20% off at the same bearing chain in the town
where I used to work)  What else can or should I use this stuff on?  I sort
of intend to use it on the head stud to case threads (I pulled all the studs
like a satanist) but anything else?  Particularly I'm having a bit of
trouble deciding what to use under the main case through bolts/washers and
the rest of the split line hardware.  My previous experience was to use the
Permatex Aviation Form a Gasket that I'd use thoughout but I see AVP had
used some super gooey clear silicone that seemed to seal well on this case
before.  Weird stuff, sort of not quite hardened like the consistency of
thick clear gelatin or agar gel, HELL to get off.  About the only good thing
I have to say about their assembly techniques was this stuff whatever it was
sure didn't permit leaks, there at least.  Now for around the barrels and
for the cam plug I was just going to use a good quality Loctite high temp
silicone.  AVP also used silicone around the oil pump, no paper gasket and
it leaked, there again I intended gasket and Permatex as always, but with
metal to metal fit I'm wondering about just the 574, but a bit worried it
may be a bit &quot;too good.&quot;  So any opinions, stick to the Permatex or
something else on the hardware?  I don't really think the anaerobic stuff is
appropriate there and I am leaning toward the Permatex not a silicone.
