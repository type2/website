Subject: Re: [T2] Building a Roof Rack for ~$100.00

&gt; &gt; I'm in the process of building a very sturdy roof rack for my Riviera for
&gt; &gt; just over $100. It will serve as a carrying device for my 200+ lb canoe and
&gt; 
&gt; WHOA!  what kind of canoe is that???, my big old 17ft Grumman only weighs
&gt; 81lbs!  

Must be a Polynesian War Canoe.
