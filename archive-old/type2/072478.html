Always keep the engine _at_ higher RPMs, so you wont overheat. Get used to going up a hill _at_ 20-30 MPH!!! You will get used to people flipping you off!!! Take the basic spare parts.

Hi listees,

I will be embarking on only my second long distance trip in about a week.  
Omaha &gt; Kansas City &gt; Denver &gt; Vail &gt; Vegas (maybe if I can get extra 
vacation days off)....  Anyway, I have never travelled in the mountains in my 
74 campmobile (1700 / single carb / no FI) and am wishing to find out 
information about adjustments I may need to do in the mountains/high 
altitude??  Is there a big difference between Denver and Vail for adjustments 
needed, or once I adjust in Denver am I fine all the way to Vail??  I would 
appreciate any mountain tips anyone can pass along....TIA.

PS  Thanks to all out there who share their knowledge.... :)
