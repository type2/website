Subject: Still No Spark !

So It occurred to me that I hadn't checked the main spark wire running 
from the coil to the distributor, so I insulated myself, held the 
exposed cable close to some metal and have my roomate turn her over ... 
nothing. NO spark, so I assumed dead coil. I went over to my local vw 
shop and bought a new coil, I wired it all up and turn her over .... no 
start. I tested again and still no spark.

So I have electrics running off the coil and my starter twirls but no 
spark going to my distributor. I checked the connection from the 
ignition and its on nice and tight, but is it possible that somewhere 
UP the line to the key there is a problem ? Could an ignition switch 
issue prevent there from being current when I turn the key all the way 
? When I turn the key I get power everywhere but to the distributor !

I've checked the fuse panel under the dash, all good, checked all the 
connections in the engine bay ... I dont know now !
