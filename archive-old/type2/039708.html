Gentlepersons-
                       Since a few of the list members are POR-15 dealers, 
I'd be curious if
they could respond as to the quality of the steering wheel repair kit? Not 
only on the
black VW wheels, but (if they're familiar with the manufacturer), it's use on 
an original
&quot;Brooklands&quot; wheel- both with a black rim and the cream coloured one. 
Thanks in advance.
