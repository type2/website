Subject: Re: [T2] My bus is running, well.. close to great!

Hi

I dont mean to panic you but there is another possibility that bob doesnt 
mention. It sounds to me like your rocker box gaskets could be leaking. They 
sit directly above the heat exchangers. If they are leaking oil this goes 
straight onto your heat exchangers (exhaust) and this problem will produce 
the white smoke your seeing out of the rear vents.

I would suggest looking at this BEFORE you drive the bus again :). Hopefully 
bob is correct and the problem will fix itself. The good news if that if the 
rocker cover gaskets are leaking its a very cheap and very easy problem to 
solve.

Hope that helps
Michael

Smelled kinda oily. Normal? The bus only
&gt; &gt; has about 200 miles on it since a complete rebuild. I did have the 
&gt;valves
&gt; &gt; adjusted at 100. Seems to have good power and idle fine.
&gt;
&gt;probably burning off the assembly materials and the greasy fingerprints on
&gt;the exhaust etc, but keep an eye on it.  however coming from the vents on
&gt;the back pillers is a concern, was the engine on???  that is the intake
&gt;for the cooling air nothing should be coming out, cool air should be going
&gt;in while the engine is running.
&gt;
&gt;Bob
