Bussers,
After painting the bus, it's time to replace all the glass, new rubber all
around.  The side louver windows and the rear hatch glass fit well, nice and
snug.  But I'm stuck on the left rear side glass, the one with the vent wing
toward the front.  The new gasket fits nicely on the glass, and I renewed
the rubber on the vent wing, but nohow noway will the glass press into the
opening.  I've tried it both with the vent in and even without it in the
opening.  Warm gasket, silicone spray, pushing and a wedge against the wall
to no avail.  I know it's supposed to be a tight fit, but it just won't go.
Am I missing something?
