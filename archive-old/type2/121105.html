Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Oil Removal

remember, you really want to check the amount of oil after the engine 
has run a little.  Do you have a brand new oil filter installed?  If so, 
that should help drop the level down a little.

Otherwise the siphon might work.. or attach something to suck it out - 
turkey baster maybe?

&gt; OK, I have finally added too much oil to my '72 engine.  I guess about 
&gt; 1.5 quarts too much.  All the oil is fresh and clean and new.
&gt; 
&gt; Opinions sought: could I remove some of the oil through my oil filler 
&gt; tube by slipping a tube down there and siphoning out some of the oil??
&gt; 
&gt; I really don't want to try to drain the oil again.  It is sitting on a 
&gt; dolly, and I would have to 'lift' the engine another 8 inches to get 
&gt; below it.
