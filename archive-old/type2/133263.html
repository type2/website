&gt; &gt; since this is a 70 aspect ratio it is almost exactly the same diameter as

&gt;
&gt; On the subject of wider tires, remember that wider tires will require more
&gt; force to steer with the bus stationary, such as when parallel parking.

yes of course
&gt;
&gt; This is a particular concern for '72 and earlier buses with their fragile
&gt; worm-and-peg steering boxes.  I suspect that VW switched to the
&gt; worm-and-roller boxes in response to greater failure rates after the
&gt; switch from bias tires to radial tires.

very possible, I do have a 78 with the roller box steering. and I try to
always be moving a little when turning the steering even if just rocking
back and forth
