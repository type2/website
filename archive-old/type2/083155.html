Somewhat like a scavenger hunt?

&gt; As I see it, other than tools that will probably be on hand in droves (my
&gt; 3/4&quot; socket sets lives in my bus), you will need a new seal, some shims,
&gt; and a new clutch disc.  I don't usually travel with a flywheel lock for T1
&gt; engines, but I can't imagine that 10-20 will not be on hand in various
&gt; tool boxes.  I also don't *usually* travel with the dial indicator, but I
&gt; will try to remember to drop it in the bus.

I believe Troy's engine is a T4. I'll be sure and pack my bolt on
flywheel lever.
