Subject: Re: [T2] fuel sender

I hear you.  But today it decides to work  again.  Well, 1/2 way anyhow.  I don't really mind it as long  as it is accurate on the Empty side of the guage.  We'll see how  long it lasts.  I did like the looks of that bulkhead cover,  though.  Couldn't I use that to access the tank for changing fuel  lines?  I want to convert it to metal lines.  Cheers...KR

Dropping the engine is different from taking it out. You don't need to
disconnect everything on top, just a few things, and you can choose to
disconnect from the tranny or drop engine and tranny together. All
you're doing is lowering the engine out of the way so that you can take
out the firewall and pull the gas tank.

Okay, that's all the PITA I'm going to be about the matter. Just
offering an alternative. And Barry's right. You're not going to be
doing this again (unless you have gunk or rust in the tank, in which
case you won't be able to pull the whole tank through that access
anyway, whether it's round, square or septagonal).
