&gt;I just put the $290 pistons in my 79 GE and so far they're doing fine.  Of 
&gt;course the engine only has about 2 miles on it so far.  They sure were 
&gt;purty when they came out of the box and fit real well, too.  g



&gt;Bus Depot has a Brazilian setup
&gt;for $290.00. There is a guy on Ebay selling a setup that will boost to 2.2
&gt;without requiring any additional machining for $350.00.
