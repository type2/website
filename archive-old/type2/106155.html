&gt; Question: according to the bentley(and the owners

Yep.

&gt; mine has more....should i change mine to read what
&gt; these 2 manuals say?

Looks like someone has put them in to prevent the stock ones from blowing.
This indicates a wiring problem.
 
&gt; Secondly...i have one fuse that has blown 2 times in
&gt; the last month....(number 2) what could be the cause?

Undo the battery cable and remove the license plate light. The terminals are
not well protected for the body or each other.

&gt; And lastly...this past week my headlights have refused
&gt; to work on low beam...flip to high, work
&gt; everytime....any sugeestions??

Good advice from Wakanska. Check the resistance of the wires.
