Subject: Re: [T2] more manifold problems

I am going to go the Heli-coil, stepped stud route. 
However, I can't find a Heli-coil kit that will fit my
size.  Any suggestions of where to look?  And I
suppose I'll need that super orange stuff to get the
grease out from under my fingernails.

&gt; I guess you didn't like the helicoil/stepped stud
&gt; recommendations.  Sounds 
&gt; like you are looking for a band-aid fix that will
&gt; take five minutes, won't 
&gt; get your hands greasy and will last forever.  I
&gt; can't help you there but I 
&gt; will say this - if you're planning on driving your
&gt; bus outside of towing 
&gt; range, I suggest you rethink your repair strategy.

&gt; &gt;Someone suggested to JB weld the stud in.  That

&gt; &gt;it a permanent fixture, but does that really

&gt; &gt;Thank you for the help.  I usually look through the
&gt; &gt;archives on stuff like this, but they are still
&gt; down.

&gt; &gt; &gt; you can either get a helicoil
&gt; &gt; &gt; kit for it or tap
&gt; &gt; &gt; oversize (9 or 10mm, I always do 10mm) and use a
&gt; &gt; &gt; stepped stud.  Finding the
&gt; &gt; &gt; stepped studs can be difficult but they are out
&gt; &gt; &gt; there.
