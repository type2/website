It frosts me when people refer to the 79 head as the Vanagon head.

2 TOTALLY different part numbers and valve size.

THE 79 head is a one-year-only head.

79 head part numbers:
029-101-371A left and 029-101-371B right

80-83.5 part numbers:
071-101-371A left and 071-101-371B right
````````
Well I took a 071-101-371A off of my '79 but I'm not that picky, you 
don't happen to have either sitting around do you?
