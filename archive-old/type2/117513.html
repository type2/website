Subject: Re: [T2] Need advice on adjusting Rear Torsion Bars

&gt; Well the old Bus is dragging its rear a little bit and could use a boost.

&gt;  I have a Haynes book on the transporter, but the instructions on adjusting
&gt; the reat torsion bars are a wee bit obtuse for me.
&gt; 
&gt; Any advice from someone who has actually performed the torsion bar adjustment
&gt; would be greatly appreciated.

and a little bit in the same thread, I have a set of heavy duty torsion
bars from a delivery van and would like to swap them out for my lighter
torsion bars...the splines look the same but before I tear the rear end
apart are there any special problems or things to  watch out for

TIA
