In the case I mentioned, all of the heads and all of the pistons were affected,
so it is unlikely that a foreign object got in there.  Some were worse than
others.  It almost looked like the piston had fused to the head, then ripped
itself away, then repeated the process.  I guess overheated is a good guess.  I
don't have any experience with that.  The head which had the worst damage also
was the cleanest...almost like fresh aluminum.  I guess the heat burned off all
the carbone.   John Jensen in Annapolis.
