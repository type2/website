Mark says:

&gt; three things i noticed:  when i stop cranking the engine and return the
key
&gt; to &quot;on&quot;, in that second the engine coughs and sputters for a few seconds
and
&gt; tries to run.  it won't stay running, and it also won't try to start when
&gt; i'm cranking.

Mark::

Make sure that you have 12v at the coil when the ignition switch is turned
to &quot;start&quot; (cranking).  Requires a helper to turn the key or a push button
&quot;jumper switch&quot;  from the engine bay.   A defective ignition switch  (among
other causes) will prevent 12 v from getting to the coil when turned to the
start position, and no spark.  When you release it and it return to the &quot;on&quot;
position, it allows the 12v to the coil, and the engine tries to start in
that last few seconds it is still moving as it finishes turning over.

Ask me how I know... 8^).  Good luck.  P-mail me if this doesn't make sense.
