I have a '72 bus I picked up for cheap as doner for my identical '72 bus.  I
have removed what I wanted from the doner (engine, transmission and various
small interior items).  I would like to donate it to anyone in need of
whatever is left on it or in need of body parts.  I am in Sacramento,
California. If anyone is intersted please email me.  I'm not parting it out, I
need to get rid of the whole thing (landlord is pissed).  

If I don't get any response from the list it will go to the crusher next week.
I hate to do it but I'm left with no choice.  I'm sure someone can make use of
it.

Thanks
