Subject: Re: [T2] re: water/ sink/ faucet on '81 westfalia

Hi Anton
 
I have an 81 Westy with a sink and propane tank.  Feel free to ask me any questions.
 
First of all - 
 
There is no gray water tank.  The water from the sink drains right out onto the ground.  You can bring along a bucket if you wish, when you are camping, to collect the gray water.  
 
The fresh water tank is on the driver's side, before the hanging closet.  A water line runs from it to the water pump, which should be mounted on the floor under the sink.  That pumps water up to the sink.  
 
The faucet turns two ways - one opens up the valve to the outside, so if you are connected to outside water, it runs through the faucet.  The other runs the water from the tank.
 
As for the propane, there is a valve on the tank that opens and closes the tank.  I was pleasantly surprised to find my tank had a lot of propane left in it after sitting for two years.  Why don't you open the valve and turn on the burner and see what happens?
 
I also have some tricks for getting the stove going under propane if you need them.
 
Good luck.
 
E. Marc Coe
