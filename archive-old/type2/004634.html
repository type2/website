Subject: Re: [T2] BustedBus is great!

BustedBus is indeed great.  Friendly and fast service from Joe.

And you feel good about giving some quality parts a second chance at busdom.

&gt; I've gotten a few things from them... always good quality and very
&gt; clean. They really work with you too if you looking for hard to find
&gt; things. Def worth a visit before you purchase a new and expensive
&gt; item.

&gt; &gt;Volks,
&gt; &gt;Recently received an order from www.bustedbus_dot_com and was very satisfied.
&gt; &gt;It arrived quickly, all used parts were clean and looked as close to
brand
&gt; &gt;new as possible.
