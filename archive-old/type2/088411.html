Subject: foam pads or sisal fibre pads for my 70 bug seats?

OK so gonna order these today, but don't know which to use? I see some
articles saying foam, others using the sisal. I'd appreciate anyone who has
actually done this giving me a heads up before I tackle this job. I have the
TMI interior, a hot sunny day, so I think it's time to put those puppies out
in the sun to loosen them up and quit procrastinating!!!
