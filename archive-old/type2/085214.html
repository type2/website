Yes It does get hot when you have the key in the &quot;on&quot; position.

Subject: [T2] Coil feels hot to the touch!



Dear Listees:

Last night while me and son were trouble-shooting the electrical in our 70 
bus, he noticed that the coil was very hot.

We had not been running the engin at all.

We were just following wires and such around to find problems.

I touched the coil and it was very hot.

We disconnected it.

Do these coils get hot when the ignition is on with the motor not running?

Do they get hot when the engine is running?

I think we have a wiring problem to the coil, right?

Many thanks.

Bill and Erik Spencer
Kirksey, KY
