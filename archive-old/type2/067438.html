Subject: Re: Bus ancestry - the dymaxion car?

Thanks for posting this story Tom!  Buckminster was a petty sharp old 
guy!  And yes, he's the same guy that Bucky Balls are named after - a 
complex carbon molecule!

Anyhow, when I worked at the factory, there was a fella there who got an 
old car magazine every month.  It was printed on newsprint but it dealt 
strictly with cars that were from the 50's and before.  Anyhow, one of 
the readers sent in a picture of an old car they found in a junkyard and 
there was no I.D. on it at all.  Turns out it was an old Ford prototype 
that was made for one year, and yes, it was based on the dymaxion.  This 
prototype was marketed for salesmen and it had a spacious interior so 
they could live out of it.  It looked like a teardrop camper on wheels 
although narrower and longer.

It's really amazing to see what car companies have come and gone and to 
see just how much experimentation went on from the 20's on through the 
50's in the auto industry.  There are cars you've never seen or heard of 
that many old timers can fondly remember seeing and driving!

BTW:  The dymaxion could turn on a dime.  As I recall, Buck drove it in 
the World's Fair parade and amazed the crowd by driving a short distance 
and then spinning the dymaxion around in a tight circle.  He even caused 
mayhem by circling a police man at arms' length in a New York intersection.

Now, back to your regularly scheduled VW listserv...
