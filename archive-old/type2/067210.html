&gt; To Barry - have you tried heat?
&gt; 

Know... what do I know?  Not much Bob.  Thanks for the reply.  Apparently the 
mechanic did use heat and he did free four of 6 nuts.  I'm not sure where he 
was when his socket shattered, that is if he was making any progress with the 
last two.

I am a complete beginner when it comes to all this mechanic stuff.  For 
years, I've been an amateur raadio operator... now, I'm just changing hats 
and loving it.  Ohh for a Folly load of cash!
