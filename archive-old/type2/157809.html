Subject: Re: [T2] How long to run bus to charge a battery?

&lt;&lt; Then I put the battery on a charger overnight. It wasn;t enough juice
in there to crank the engine. 
The battery is 3 years old, has been sitting unused for about a year. 
Do you think it's toast?&gt;&gt;


The not taking a charge overnight should be a good indication that the
battery 
is AMF.


&lt;&lt; Or should I have to run the bus much longer to get the battery
charged up from zero.&gt;&gt;

If the charger wouldn't do it--the alternator sure isn't going to.

Unzip the mattress and buy a new one.

if you had the battery on a tender--it would probably still be OK.
Leaving them in a vehicle uncharged, unattended, and forgotten is a
no-no.
