Subject: [T2] Tune UP, turn on and drop out!

Karen and I are tuning up our dub a dub dubbs and it's going ok.  My dizzy
has got oil in it somehow and is quite a mess.  I've got a new cap, rotor
and points, but am curious if I'll need to do more than replace them.  As
in, is something more sinister and nefarious going on in there that needs a
priest, a live rooster and an inept self styled meKanic? (Fortunately?!  I
have 1 of the three all too handy)

I didn't get any responses to my question about getting my broken heater
cable out of the steel tube guide, but I did get a note from a fellow to
hot/to cold listee with the same problem.  Any help would be gratefully
received, even if it's a totally crazy hair brained idea, destined to be
outlawed all too soon!

Karen wants me to ask if their is a good list, like this, for bugs.  She
blew a valve gasket on her 74 Super and then drove it to her Aunt's adding
oil every once in too late.  (She was on her way to a wedding)  We put new
gaskets on both valves and a new oil filter and managed to limp it home from
the Canadian border.  Her rocker arms smell burnt, her rods look burnt.  So,
she's looking for a place to ask advice without burning someone elses
valves.  If you know what I mean.

Anyhow, thanks again everyone!  I've learned so much in so short a time that
it boggles my mind.  On the other hand, everything I've learned never seems
to be apropos to the broken item at hand.  All in due time!

Thanks!
