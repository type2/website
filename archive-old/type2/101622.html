Subject: Re: [T2] '78 battery drain

&gt; thanx for the help even tho i'm still not too sure. what is the average cost
&gt; of a starter?

New Bosch from BusDepot: $99.95
Your labor to install once and forget it: 1 hour (rounded way up)

Cheap starter at AutoZone: $39.99
Your labor to install, remove, return, install, remove, return, etc.: 12 hours

Screwdriver to short across relay: $1
Your life: priceless
(make sure you put the bus in neutral and set the parking brake before using
the screwdriver!)

Before doing anything, I would recommend turning off the bus and putting an
ammeter across the battery poles. Start pulling fuses until the meter reads
ZERO. Something is wired into that last fuse that needs to be moved to the
ignition switch (or some other switch).

A possible fix: install a second battery just for accessories (i.e., wire one
battery to the starter and the other to the front of the bus. Use the
dual-battery wiring kit from BusDepot for charging.

BTW, anyone try moving the battery to under the back seat? My battery area
(passenger rear) has the typical rust and is almost completely gone.
Considering that the ground connection for the trans/engine and the starter
are no more than 24&quot; from the back seat, it should be an almost brainless task
to move it. I would put it in a marine battery container...

-Eric
