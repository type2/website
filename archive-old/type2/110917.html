&gt;Am going to drop the engine to do some work and figured I would go ahead and
&gt;swap the gas tank while I was in there, have a fresh one all treated and
&gt;ready :)  What size fuel line will I need to replace all that is in that
&gt;compartment?
&gt;
&gt;Also anyone know the size of the 2 inch piece of rubber line that is above
&gt;the aux battery compartment?
&gt;
&gt;If it matters this is all on a 73 bus...
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance,
