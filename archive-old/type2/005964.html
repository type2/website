I fear my name and commentary may be dim memory for some of you.

I am Matthew Bulley, owner of many, many VW's &amp; Porsches over the years, 
and holder of many opinions about maintenance and such. Sorry to be out of 
touch. Business has been brisk or non-existent this past few months, making 
life hectic as I scramble to complete a contract, or scramble to get one 
started. Things look a little more stable for the coming months...

I am preparing to finance the rebuild the 2.0 liter hydraulic that pushes 
our 1982 Westy. I need some motor-building opinions based in *experience*. 
When I say &quot;experience&quot; I am looking for your personal encounters, not what 
your neighbor, cousin, or local hot-rod builder has told you over a beer. 
If you have used these parts

I've performed somewhere around 60 motor rebuilds. In the past I have been 
very successful in building reliability, chiefly from stock parts, or parts 
made to increase reliability/longevity (aux. oil cooler, larger capacity 
oil pump, etc.). The rub with this rebuild: I want to build some 
performance without sacrificing reliability. I'm not looking for a hot-rod, 
but would like to get better performance without trying to re-engineer some 
other power source. I like the 2.0 and feel confident that your design 
review can help me make a reliable, powerful motor for our van. I'd like 
your  educated comments on my ideas.

FIRST OFF: you should know what this motor is up against. I am anal, 
scrupulous, and meticulous about maintenance. I go to the dealer for parts, 
replace things before they break, and use a torque wrench on my spark 
plugs. I don't carry any tools or parts, and my van never lets me down. You 
get the idea.

However, I drive the ever-living piss out of my vehicles. You'd think I was 
furious at my vehicles. I accelerate at full-throttle 98.6% of the time. 
The red-line dots on my speedo are where I shift. Even if it means keeping 
the pedal pinned to the floor for 20 minutes straight, I won't hesitate to 
drive 70 mph with five folks in the van up a 10% grade in August in the 
Mojave. I've always driven this way, and this motor will receive the same 
grief.

Here are my thoughts on what how the motor will be constructed, and I'd 
love comments on the RELIABILITY issues surrounding these parts/machine 
shop services.

This 2.0 case should be true, but I will have it checked, and align-bored, 
if need be. I hear that over-sized bearings for the type 2/4 mains are few 
and far between. Thoughts?

I will start with a counter-weighted crank, and have all of the 
rotating/reciprocating mass in the motor absolute-zero balanced. I will 
have the flywheel lightened, as the added mass in the crank counter-weights 
will more than offset any harmonic wobble, and create adequate mass for a 
smooth idle. Thoughts on how much to have shaved off the flywheel? The 
journals will be mirror polished. Anything I've missed so far?

Next, I would like to go with a set of NPR 96mm flat-top pistons. I built a 
couple sets in a 914's (one of which was mine), and loved them. I am a 
little concerned about their ability to shed the heat that pushing the 
Westy could create. Thoughts? Anybody run a set of these in a 1976-1983 Van 
or Westy? Any problems? Anyone have a set of NOS NPR 96's for a 2.0 for 
less than $300? Will probably have the pistons polished. Is this worth it? 
Does this reduce friction, reduce predetonation? By the way, the pistons 
that are coming out of the motor have less than 20k on them. They are 
genuine VW. Are they worth anything?

I would like to have some bigger valves in the heads, and have the 
combustion spaces polished. How much bigger can the valves be without 
swapping RELIABLY for performance? Is it too risky? Seems like respiration 
is a rich lode of improvement for the type 2/4, but I don't want problems, 
either.

The motor will have a oil-pressure boost springs, a Melling high-capacity 
oil pump, an oil thermostat, and an auxiliary oil cooler mounted up front 
behind the stock grill.

Finally, assuming that I have done all of the above, is it worth it to add 
higher-ratio rocker arms? Seems like it would be. I can't think of any 
reliability issues that those could influence. Thoughts?

Thanks for the help,
