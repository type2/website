Subject: whats the easiest way to check if I have a california model?

I suspect I may have a California model 83 aircooled
vanagon.  What is the easiest way to check, and also,
I know the PO put a new engine in there, so how can I
check to make sure if the smog equipement is
california then the engine is also?  How hard would it
be to convert if it is california and what are the
advantages.  Obviously the parts are easier to find
for the federal
