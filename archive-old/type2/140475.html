Subject: high idle

Howdy folks,       I have a '72 bus with duel Solex pict 3 carbs.   I was in 
there doing some cleaning and dusting in the engine compartment.  While 
there I took out the air cleaner and other odds and ends.  I took off all 
the vacuum hoses and replaced with new.  Now that everything is back 
together, the bus has a really high idle.  I didn't really touch the carbs, 
other than to wash them a bit with a gassy rag.  Did I get the hoses put 
back on wrong?  What about this high idle?  Is this caused by improper 
placement of my hoses?  Can anybody describe to me exactly where the hoses 
go to and from, or link me to a site with photos of a '72 bus engine 
properly connected?  I've searched the archives to no avail.  Thanks in 
advance,
                  Kevin  Snow
