Subject: RE: [T2] Drum brake star adjuster

Okay,
the sleeve/housing that the star adjusters sit in on my bus were
held on with two bolts.  Just between and slightly under these holes
for the bolts however there is a set pin that is attatched to the
backing plate.  It is difficult to see if you are looking into the
backing plate where your pads reside.  To see what I am talking
about, grab a flashlight and take those two bolts out.  Get on your
back and scoot under the bus so that you can see the back of the
plate.  Shine flashlight in the direction of the threaded holes that
you can now look through since removing your bolts.  You will see
the end of that pin.  It is attatched.  I had to use a metal punch
to knock mine out, be careful if you do this as too much applied
force will warp the plate where your sleeve housing(if that is what
that part is called) mounts.

I managed to get mine out with very little warping, but I was pretty
careful.  The extraction distorted the circular proportion of the
hole that this pin rests in, but the two bolts that hold that in
place are so freakin huge that a set pin, in my opinion, was
minimally required to apply any stability to what was already being
applied by the two bolts that hold that housing on.  I just filed it
flat and remounted it.
