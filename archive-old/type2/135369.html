Subject: CR question

Cc'd my heads, measured deck height; came up with a compression ratio 
of 7.36:1 if I use the .010 shims that came with the gasket set.

Bob Hoover seems to like a 7.5:1 CR, Dale Mueller and Ron van Ness like 
7:1.

An 0.30 shim would give me 7.08, and an .040 would down tune me to 
6.95:1.

Opinions? Given that I want long engine life, should I order thicker 
shims? Or is 7:36:1 a good number (with regular gas)?

(2.0 L, hydraulic lifters, FI)
