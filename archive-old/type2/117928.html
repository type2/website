&gt;do you currently have a trade in block??
&gt;why a 1700 why not upgrade to a 2liter more common easier to find

Do NOT get another 1700. Get the 2 liter they are built on a more solid
technology, that being of a stroker vs a larger piston. Dont understand what
I just said? Thats ok. Doesnt matter, get the 2 liter. EVERY 1700 I have 
seen
fails sooner then the 2 liter.
