&gt;  i live in a little backwards town, the
&gt; more derelict cars in your yard, the higher your
&gt; social status.

Just outside of Milledgeville Illinois (population about 400) there's a guy
who uses a loaf bus as a horse feeder. He tosses hay bales in the sliding
door and leaves the back hatch open for the horses to feed out of. It's
parked about 50 feet from his house.
