Subject: Canvas replacement on 1971 Westfalia

Hi everyone
I am going to replace the canvas on a 1971 Westfalia. It seems like there 
are several manufactures making replacements as well as a replacement from 
Westfalia themselves. What is the common wisdom on this problem. Who makes 
the best replacement.   Thanks, Bill.
