Subject: Re: Rear Brake Drum on '68

A puller that puts pressure against the axle and bolts to the drum works 
great but what if you don't have one? Try a trick I've used to get wire 
wheels off the splines in the past. Take the nut off spray penetrating oil. 
Put the nut back on leaving it several turns away from the drum. slowly drive 
in a parking lot doing figure eights. I've always heard a pop. If you don't 
stop frequently and see if the drum has popped out. This has never failed.
