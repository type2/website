Subject: Re: [T2] Starting problems in the DEATH BUS

Similiar thing going on with my bus. Next time it won't start trying putting 
it in third gear and pusing back on it.

If that helps it means that the starter is getting hung on the freewheel, i 
haven't fixed the problem yet but I know that sometimes some bolts on the 
starter have to be tightened per the Muir book.

&gt;Put the key in the ignition, turn the key, dash lights dim, no starter. 
&gt;Cleaned all battery connections + and - , turn the key, no starter. Went 
&gt;inside to look at trusty Bently manual, came back out, started right up. 
&gt;This has happened with 2 different starters and 2 different coils. Should I 
&gt;replace both the battery cable and the ground strap?
