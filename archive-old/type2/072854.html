Hi,

The fourth annual Tadoussac get-together will take place May 21-24, 1999.
Of our many activities, this is our club's only &quot;official&quot; event and, as
word has been getting out, we've had a growing number of participants every
year. Last year, 25 Westies attended and we're expecting even more this
year.

We'll leave Friday, May 21 from Montreal and will stay overnight on the Ile
d'Orleans near Quebec City. There will be two meeting places: (1) at 4:30PM
at the reststop on highway 20 east of Montreal, located between exits 115
and 120 and (2) in Quebec City at L'AVENTURIER, 710 rue Bouvier, exit
Pierre-Bertrand Nord.

Saturday we'll drive on and plan to arrive in Tadoussac later that day.
There we'll set up camp in the dunes, relax, and enjoy the beautiful
scenery.  This should be a very laid-back and stress-free event. Head back
towards Montreal either Sunday or Monday, at your discretion.

Small maps of the Friday meeting places can be found on our web site at

bother you :)
