Subject: Re: [T2] Friday! VW Trends article HCBF / FMBC 

Nice 2 page article can be found in the May edition of VW Trends, regarding 
the High Country Bus Festival of 2002 Photographed and written by Tom 
Hubbard.
With mention of Snoopy, Steve Dolan and Mark Derring and many others.
Nice emphasis on the social aspect and fun of bus piloting.
Rusty
