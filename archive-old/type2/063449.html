Subject: Re: '71 Poptop, seats

&gt;I'm also looking to replace the standard front seats with seats with 
&gt;headrests (due to nasty whiplash when my last bus was killed in a 
&gt;rear-ender). I've heard that this is not an easy job, and I'm looking for 
&gt;any folks who have succeeded doing it. I would definitely prefer not to 
&gt;weld, or do any other body reconstruction. Ideas?

Jon,

Coincidentally, I just installed front seats with headrests from a '73 bus
in my '71 last night.  I bought mine from listmember Jon Hathaway at the
Woodstock, NY meet for $10.  The driver's side seat had 3 broken springs (I
replaced these with springs I removed from an old bed box spring) and I
added some foam to replace the dead horsehair stuffing.  

Some people I've spoken to do not like the headrests in the camper because
they are difficult to remove and they conflict with the setup of the child's
cot when camping.  I was concerned, as you are, about neck support in an
accident and that was my main motivation for the installation.  I was
rocking in the seat last night banging the back of my head against the
headrest--support feels safe and good!

Front seats from a '73, '74, and '75 bus will fit the '68-'71 seat tracks
with no modification.  Headrests were optional on '73 seats so you might not
find them on a pair of donor seats.  '76-up seats will not fit without
modification--look for '73-'75 seats to save yourself the extra work.

Good luck,
Ron
