&gt; I recently replaced the exhaust elbow.  There is some sort of release valve
&gt; (for lack of a better description) that has a cap that screws on.  Well mine

&gt; immediately?
&gt; Only reason I ask is it may have something to do with back pressure I am
&gt; thinking.....

If this is the elbow that connects the left heater box to the crossover
pipe and leads the exhaust to the catalytic converter and thence to the
muffler then that cap is present to give a technician a place to insert an
exhaust gas analyzer probe before the catalytic converter.  It does need
replacement but does not need immediate replacement.  Only on an
absolutely new pipe would this cap even be a possibility.  Usually this
cap is so rusted into place that removal is not even to be considered.
Actually the presence of the elbow implies the presence of the
has-not-been- availiable-for-20-years crossover pipe which is a true
rarity!

How you will obtain a replacement for that cap I do not know but it ought
to be replaced.  The bus will not run at optimum but you will not damage
anything by running without it.

                             OOK!
