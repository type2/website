    I've got a variant. My '69 bus had the &quot;press for test&quot; type, my '73
has one that does nothing but push inward with you press it, but then
lights up sometimes and stays lit for days, weeks even, then goes out
and stays out for months, then lights up again for awhile, etc. Never
could figure it out. Doesn't seem to have anything to do with the
brakes.
