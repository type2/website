&gt;the case of the Vanagon. The heads are both square posts, not so if you were
&gt;talking 72-78. With minor adapting both engines can be swapped. There may be

Something a lot of people don't realize and a minor issue is that early square
port heads have the smaller round port 2.0 liter style intakes whereas late
square
port have the larger 39mm intake.  A trivial difference but there, the '79
probably
has small one cast with some sort of 02X number whereas the vanagon heads
are I think cast 039.  Regardless I got both styles somewhere and I've
noticed it.
All AMC replacements are the large valve.  Only really critical that if you
have a
set rebuilt and are going to pop the massive $5 each for new intakes to be
sure
to measure what is in the head, not what the supplier tells you is in it.

As to adapting either way, we've been over it a number or times.  80 into '79
needs to use second dipstick or plug it (tapered steel pin nice,) use Vanagon
breather (sort of hard to get make sure it is with case,) drill out the motor
mount holes for 10mm bolts (which you need to get,) and of course swap off
the fan shrouds.

'79 into '80 is a real annoyance as you have no dipstick provision.  I
wouldn't
do it for that reason alone.  If building new on a pre vanagon case into a
vanagon,
just drill the dipstick hole, use the bus breather, and pull out the
helicoils carefully
on the motor mounts and you have M10x1.25 bolt holes.
