Subject: Re: Fish oil / Rust

&gt;  I've  heard from many sourses that fish oil is a good additive for rust
&gt;prevention... Penetrates ... But I've never seen it listed as an ingredient in
&gt;Rustoleum or Derusto.  But hey!  I don't spend my life reading paint can labels
&gt;either...

Brother Hoover advises that they quit putting the fish goop in Rustoleum in
the late sixties, so I have to amend. This makes me feel much better
because I *like* the stuff, mainly because the nozzle they give you sprays
so much better than something like Krylon does. I always felt like I was
sticking some poor schmuck down the road with unpaintable paint. Relieved.
