&gt; So, I checked the archives and called my VWFLAPS and still can't seem to

&gt; mushy matter.  I want to put a compu-fire electronic ignition into my 77,
&gt; but I am worried that there will be some problem with the FI when the
&gt; points are taken out. Has anyone done this in their bus?  Not for any of
&gt; you 79 buses which I think had electronic installed originaly??
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks a bunch


I've never had the Compu-fire points in my '78, but I have used the
Pertronix with no problems. The bus is Fuel Injected.
