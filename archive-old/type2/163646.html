Subject: Re: [T2] Foldable Spare

Right on the nose!!! Before we sold our &quot;rusty&quot; toyota truck i removed the
spare tire winch and that is what i would be planning on using. However -
the problem is not with the winch it is with the space for the spare rim...I
will look into some of the options for wheels that was mentioned earlier...

&gt; Some Japanese pickups had a nifty device that extended a cable or chain
&gt; down from a tiny winch.  You hooked the chain/cable to the center hole of
&gt; the wheel and winched the thing up with the jack crank until it contacted
&gt; the bottom of the car.
&gt;
&gt; That would work a treat for an under-bus tire stowage arangement.
