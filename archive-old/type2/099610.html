Subject: Oil Regulator gaskets

Hi

Where could I find gaskets for the oil regulator and relief valve screws? I 
have 1600 engine rebuilt
3000 miles (14 months) ago. It is leaking from those two locations (big 
screws under the engine
at the front and back ), unless it is leaking at the two block halves 
joint. There is also a lot of oil
residue on the &quot;moustache&quot;bar at the back. Any ideas where the leak might be?
Thanks a lot,


Rogelio
