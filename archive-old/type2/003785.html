&gt;If you've not completely sure if #1 is at the top of its stroke, pull the
#1
&gt;spark plug and insert a pencil or screwdriver through the hole to fell the
&gt;top of the cylinder.


FWIW on the T4, with a penlight and a good angle you can see down the plug
hole at the top of the piston and actually watch for exactly the point where
it turns over.  Easy in a Vanagon, a bit tough in a Bus to see at the angle.
Of course following the valves is a lot easier.
