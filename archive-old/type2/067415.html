Ben,

My figures are pulled out of what may well be a faulty memory and date from
the mid-1950's.  I assume VW used the cleanest vehicle in their line-up,
aerodynamically speaking, which would be the early-model Type II with no
overhang above the windscreen and a panel-van to boot.  Plus, they used a
very low wind speed.  But yes, the flat-plate area should be the same.

A roof-rack adds an enormous amount of drag as well as increasing the flat
plate area.  I wonder if your figures are for a Kombi with a roof rack?  Or
even, for a Kombi with a load of luggage on top :-)
