Subject: Praise for a vendor (The Bus Company).

     I haven't heard allot about The Bus Company (TBC) on the list, so I 
wanted to put in my opinion.  I just recently called out for parts on the 
list, and Ken from TBC replied that he deals in good used parts.  I ordered 
a few heating parts, a wiper arm, and some lenses.  He took the time to 
email back and forth with me to make sure I was getting exactly what I 
needed.  He packed everything for shipping carefully, and made sure the 
lenses didn't get banged up during shipping.  Everything arrived a day early 
and was in good shape (as described, good used).  I would, and probably will 
do business with Ken again if I need anything.

Here is his contact info:
www.thebusco_dot_com
P.O. BOX 51245 Seattle WA, 98115
(206)533-6525
