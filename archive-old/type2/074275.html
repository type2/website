Subject: shift adjustment threads

 
--the Bentley shows the lower end of the stick at 90 degrees from the floor of the bus on the &quot;x&quot; axis if you're sitting in the driver seat.

are we to assume that 90 degrees applies in the &quot;y&quot; direction (front to back of the bus) and therefore the lower end of the stick it to be perfectly perpendicular to the bus' floor?

I'm having trouble with this adjustment right now too.

Billy

Be sure to get the plate aligned correctly so you're stickshift has the correct throw (look in the bentley, it's really easy).
