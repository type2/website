Subject: first trip...

Hey all, 

Well, here i go. :) this sunday i'm leaving for my first road trip in my
'79 westy. We're going up to Ohio, to Cedar Point and Kings Island. While
it's not as long as some of  your adventures, it'll be the longest shes
ever taken so far (with me, i don't know about her previous lives.) Right
now, everything is runny pretty smoothly. just replaced the linkage and
found out that if your in a tight spot, Twigs will make just as good as
bushing as anything. Would of like to gotten the fridge working, but i
don't see that happening. not by the time we leave anyway, it's a matter
of wiring and stuff, i believe one of them is cut.  So wish me luck, and
i hope we'll all do okay. :) but if you see a beige Westy on the side of
the road, somewhere up in Ohio, pop in and say &quot;hi!&quot; it's probably gonna
be us. :)

Later Volks, 

Falafel
