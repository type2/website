Hi Tom and Dana,

It sounds refreshing to hear about AVP, and I'm glad
their rebuild is working for you.  For me there is
usually only one fly in the ointment, and that is hot
idle oil pressure (HIOP).  Unless AVP did a machine
shop perfect job on the  crank, main, and rod
bearings; I'll bet your hot idle oil pressure after a
half hour of 55 mph driving is not very high (5 to 10
psi).  The only builder I could find that would
guarantee hot idle oil pressure was Mark Stephens, and
he went out of business.  Boston Bob, and Mofoco will
not specify what their HIOP will be.  I'm not sure
what the difference in life of the engine is between
good hot idle oil pressure (15 to 20 psi or higher),
and average (7 psi). However, getting stuck in hour
long delays at the bay bridge going to Maryland
beaches always gives me some concern.  Particularly
since I have AC, and know that when I run it that
places even a higher heat load on the oil.

Rob
