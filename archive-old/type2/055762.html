&gt;3- close off any access to the front of the bus (i guess like the 60's
&gt;non walkthroughs)
&gt;4 -allow me to buy or build a centre console in between the two front
&gt;seats. for storage, CD's, cup holders, etc ,etc
&gt;
&gt;has anyone else thought of this? anyone else done this? any ideas or
&gt;thoughts - pro or con on my idea?

When we were converting our '78 bus to a camper, we went through alot of 
permutations.  One of them included a double bench seat that would close 
off the walk through, according both more room and a convenient storage 
area in the front.  The reason we decided not to may end up being one of 
those totally unquantifiable decisions (like that chocolate vs. vanilla 
Gary Larson cartoon).  There's just something about a walkthrough, I 
guess.  Like some feeling that you can park, climb in back, and hit the 
sack without every having to go outside into the nasty elements.  When I 
get in the bus in the morning and fire her up, sometimes I end up 
climbing in back to clean things up or find a magazine while the engine 
warms up.  For whatever reason, not having a walkthrough would change the 
character of the bus.  I doubt that went any distance to quantifying our 
decision to keep our bus a walk through, but that's what we felt, and we 
have very much appreciated the walk through (on our way from Oregon to 
Nebraska, there were some especially pissy nights when we just climbed 
straight in back).

seriously doubting that helped,
