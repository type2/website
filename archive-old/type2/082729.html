Subject: Re: [T2] Friday-Deadheads and busses

I agree with most of the stuff you said except the
young hippie thing. I am 17, have longish hair, and a
beard, and plenty of dead stickers an my busses. My
main van that I have had for two years(71 panel) runs
great and gets a tune up(by me)every three or four
months and my new bus(74 westy) which had both dead
and phish stickers and a PO who said his favorite dead
song was touch of grey, will be great once I do
something about that out of tune, oil drenched beetle
engine with no filler plate in there. Another thing
you should ad to your stats is the number of pieces of
paraphanilia stashed in the bus for each dead sticker
on the back.
Thanks,
Tyler

&gt; I have been doing a very UN-scientific, informal
&gt; sociologocal study over the last few years of
&gt; Deadheads, bus owners, and other totally trivial
&gt; stuff.  My findings are as follows:  1) Deadheads in
&gt; general are NOT bad bus owners, but the younger the
&gt; bus owner\deadhead, the worse shape they keep their
&gt; bus in.  2)If you are considering buying a bus from
&gt; a Deadhead, first ask them what their favorite
&gt; Grateful Dead song is or which GD song first got
&gt; them into the scene, If they answer &quot;Touch of Grey&quot;,
&gt; run away as fast as you possibly can and don't look
&gt; back. 3)Don't buy a bus from someone with both
&gt; Grateful Dead stickers AND PHISH stickers in the
&gt; window, it will almost certainly not have been tuned
&gt; up in the past year.  4)Don't buy a bus from a
&gt; Deadhead (or anyone else for that matter) who has
&gt; advertised the bus as either a &quot;Shaggin Wagon&quot; or a
&gt; &quot;Hippie Bus&quot; or &quot;Dead Sled&quot;, because they have
&gt; obviously missed the point. 5) When buying a bus
&gt; from a Deadhead, you can add five kharma po!
&gt; ints for every GD Show that the bus has been at, but
&gt; take away 2 points for every PHISH concert which it
&gt; has attended.  And lastly 6)When buying a bus from a
&gt; Deadhead, ask them for a beer, if they offer you a
&gt; mass produced domestic lite beer, be on your way. 
&gt; If they give you a nice full bodied micro or good
&gt; import, start talking about the bus, if they give
&gt; you a nice Amber Ale that they home-brewed
&gt; themselves, then take your new bus home and enjoy it
&gt; for years!!
&gt; Just 2 cents worth from a rapidly approaching middle
&gt; age tie-dye wearing deadhead who treats his buses
&gt; right!!!
