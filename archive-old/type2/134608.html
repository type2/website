Subject: Re: [T2] Remanufactured disk brake calipers

From Bill:


 I notice that some of the remanufactured calipers for the 1971 model 
 year have two bleeders while others have only one (on the bottom). My 
 originals had two bleeders. Would there be any particular disadvantage 
 in having only one bleeder  versus the original two bleeder setup?
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have one bleeder and it is on the bottom...... then you have the caliper on the wrong side!!

Calipers with one bleeder must have the bleeder on top or you will never bleed the air out.
