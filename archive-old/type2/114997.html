&gt; Good to know. I just took a look at mine and there is no rubber seal. Where
&gt; did you find one? Junkyard?

Get a new one instead of an old cracked one. Someone was kind and sent me
two used ones but one was too thin and the other too dried out. It's a
pretty tight fit if you can find a juicy one.

I measured the good one I found (48mm ID, 52.75mm OD, 2.65mm thick) if
anyone cares.

&gt; Get yourself and your oil filler cap down to your local FLAPS. There you
&gt; will find a large selection of square wall &quot;O&quot; rings designed for water cooled
&gt; t-stat housing gaskets. One of them will wind up being a perfect fit.

But it's a metric oil cap. ;-)
