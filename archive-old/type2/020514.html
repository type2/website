Subject: Trailer Advice

I'm torn - between 2 trailers.  Size (40&quot;x48&quot;) and price ($225) the
same, as Harbor charges no freight.  The dilemna is weight, tire size,
and color...

So, harbor has a trailer with 12&quot; wheels (red) weight 215 lbs.

Now, I know the larger wheels (bearings) will probably last a lot longer
than 8&quot;...

And a place called Armorrex has a black trailer with 8&quot; wheels that
weighs only 70 lbs.

My primary concern is overall weight...  I can carry a lot more gear for
those xtra 145 lbs on the harbor trailer...  And red is just not as
appealing...  ;-)

Or is the weight difference really negligible?
