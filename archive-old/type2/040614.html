Subject: EGR indicator

Volks,

The red EGR indicator on my 78 bus went red this evening. My alarm was
abated when I checked the owners manual and found that the indicator turns
on every 15,000 miles to remind me to service it.

I took a look at Bentley and read about the filter that I should replace and
the test that I should perform.

Two quick questions remain. First, does this indicator ever turn on when
something is really broken? Is its only function to remind me to service the
EGR. Do I put my bus at risk by driving it until the filter comes in the
mail?

Second, Bentley didn't say anything about how to reset the indicator? Does
anybody know how to do this?
