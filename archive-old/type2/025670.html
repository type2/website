Subject: Rust in the engine vents

Does anyone have advise on the best way to remove rust in the engine vents
on a 78 bus? The one that I am working on is in pretty good shape, but there
is a light film of rust in the upper rear portion of the vent and I would
prefer that it is removed (and doesn't come back).

Besides having this area bead blasted is there a way?
