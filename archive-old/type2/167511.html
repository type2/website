&gt; I have been known to put a small touch of gasket sealent on there just to push them up in there and get them right and then carefully put the heater boxes on from there..

&gt;   black blue red it's just whatever i got.. its not for sealing just tacking up long enough to let me torque it down and stay in right place..

problem is that I have got to hold em a lot better.  part of the reason is
that I had to take the exhaust system off in one piece. it's all welded
together so it is going to take a LOT more phutzing with it to get em back
in......!!   (I am a glutton for punishment.)
