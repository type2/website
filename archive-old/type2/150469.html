&amp;gt; &amp;gt;Home depot no longer sells it because of liability concerns.

&amp;gt; I wonder if this is a state regulation of legal or if they are slowly phasing it out? I saw it just last weekend.

&amp;gt; Even so, 2 gallon of this stuff is way too much so I've been buying
quart sized bottles from OSH. The fumes from this acid will rust your
chinese tools overnight so keep that in mind when you are working with it
in the garage.

At my school, we only store acids in a storeroom with an exhaust fan that
runs 24/7. The storage cabinet is completely non-metallic.  No matter how
tightly sealed the bottle, fumes will escape.
Hydrochloric (muriatic) acid is bad, sulfuric is worse.

Buy what you need, dispose of the leftovers immediately.  Don't try to
store it without the proper facility.
