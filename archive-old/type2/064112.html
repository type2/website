Yep. There used to be (still are?) contests at one of the big VW gatherings (I remember 
reading about it years ago). The contest was to see how quick you could drop a beetle 
engine. I assume they must have been something like the contests to see how quickly a 
house can be built (something like 8 hours, starting with a bare frame). Nice speed, but 
would you want to live there? &lt;grin&gt;

I once watched one of our local VW mechanics swap out an engine in a bus, and I think he 
could have set a record, if he hadn't been interrupted by the phone 3 times. Oberlander 
is quite a mechanic who set up shop here back somewhere in the late 60s or early 70s.

Among his feats, he had a strong German accent (very reassuring) and a VW van with his 
Americas tour painted on the side. The van obviously was well used. Its paint was 
intact, but it was sort of dulled in color, but the body didn't have any dents... and 
it ran perfectly... w/o a single drop of oil where he parked it on his clean shop 
floor. (Another first... only the big dealers ever took time to keep their shops clean. 
They could afford to, with what they charged.)

As I recall, the tour started on the east coast, somewhere around New York, traveled 
south over the Americas highway, to the tip of South America. Once there, he turned 
around and drove to Alaska, then back here to Eugene OR. The way I figure it, even if he 
didn't know a thing about VWs before the tour, he had to be an expert on them by the 
time he got back. &lt;grin&gt; 

I still try to imagine what that trip must have been like. He didn't talk about it much. 
He'd see me, a kid, looking at his van, and would kinda walk away, wiping his hands on a 
shop towel.
