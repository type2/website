&gt; &gt; I was out looking at my heater hoses today, when I noticed that the tube
&gt; &gt; that goes up to the defrost is filled with some kind of materail.  It
&gt; &gt; looks like insulation.  I can't figure out why it is in there.  
&gt; 
&gt; Can you say, &quot;Mice&quot;? :-)  Really and Truly!  I would be willing to lay
&gt; bucks on this.
&gt; 
How do they get into the heater pipe?  There would be no way for them to
enter it.  Plus, wouldn't they leave once the car waas started and moved?

&gt; 
&gt; A huge no!  clean it out and be prepared to do so a couple of times (Mice
&gt; take a hint like a month-long houseguest)
