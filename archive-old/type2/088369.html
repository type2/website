Subject: Need advice on heat exchangers and muffler

I've pushed mine but as far as there gona go!
Bus Depot seems to have all the stuff but I'm trying to
&quot;keep it on the cheap&quot;!
what about used?? are they ok or not worth the fuss??

I currently have the &quot;stock&quot; '78 setup w/ a pace setter muffler (no cat/egr)
I want to switch over to the one piece heat exchanger ala '72-74&amp;'79
(as opposed to the &quot;extra pluming&quot; and u-pipe), with a '72-'74 muffler.

I've read Heat/Rust/Noise and was wondering, how important is
the &quot;exhaust wrap&quot; I'm mostly a highway driver,
(50 miles each way to work, so about 100 miles a day) would I
see a benefit?? is it worth the $50 bucks a roll??
If so how many rolls do I need???

thanks,
Mike LaBarge
'78 Bus
