Matthew Kirk sends:

&gt; gang,
&gt; 
&gt; matty here. i am having a problem with my 76 westy. it
&gt; is grossly lacking in power. this thing is a dog, even
&gt; for a bus. the thing is when i shift gears i can hear
&gt; the engine race when i hit the throttle but i dont
&gt; notice the transfer in my speed. the engine races as i
&gt; hit the gas but the vehicle dsoent speed up much. it
&gt; seems that transmission is not doing its job. i have
&gt; also considered bad compression. but i really dont
&gt; know. anyone have any experience with this type of
&gt; thing. thanks- matty

Worn-out clutch disc. You have to drop the engine to fix it, but after
you've done that, it's an easy fix. On a Bus with a T4 engine, I'd unhook
the CVs, drop engine and transmission on two jacks, unbolt the transmission
from the engine and roll the transmission forward ; that way you don't have
to take the engine out from under the Bus.

Wear a good dust mask; you will find huge amounts of clutch-disc dust in
there.
