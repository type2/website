&gt;I AM very puzzled as to why they machined just the clutch surface.

I didn't say that...

&gt;You have to machine the same amount off the face where the cover bolts on, on stepped flywheels.
&gt;Otherwise the geometry is off. Then when the disk wears, you are out of
&gt;leverage to hold pressure. That is why your wing nut is at the bottom end of the threads.... you are out of 
&gt;the range of travel.
&gt;Either you need to have them redo the flywheel correctly or get another one.

The dowels were removed, the flywheel was step cut, and the dowels replaced:

&gt;* I have looked, for the past hour!, in the early split bus Bentley, bay Bentley, yellow book, Vanagon 
&gt;Bentley, Without Guesswork, Rimcos website, and all over the web to substantiate this but either it is a 
&gt;best-kept secret or my meds are wearing off!

Looking for what?
