Subject: Fwd: Re: [WetWesties] Synthetic oil

&gt; &gt;&gt; Anyone use synthetic oil in their VW?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
   
Yes.  Durablend.  Love it.  The Volvo loves it too. 
The Volvo has 300,000.  At 210,000, the Volvo got a
valve job, what became a head replacement.  The
cylinder walls were still clearly cross-hatched. 
Original motor.  No bull.
   
Last time the VW was pulled-apart to get new heads,
her cylinder walls were still cross-hatched too.  45k
on the T2 engine so-far.
   
Volvo every 3000 miles, and the T2 every 3 months (as
I don't put nearly as many miles on it as I do the
primary car).
