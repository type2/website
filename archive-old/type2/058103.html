-Ok, I've asked once who the other Montanan is, I think he/she's in 
Missoula.  
-Now I'm asking about the memeber in Calgary, I frequently get up to 
that fantastic city and wouldn't mind sharing a brew and BS'ing about 
t2s for an afternoon.  
- this is to the memeber's from victoria B.C., &quot;I wish you'd made it 
down to the Seattle/Olympic Penninsula campout.&quot;  It was small but 
really kewl.  Mike Lewis picked an awesome campsite and we really had 
some great conversations around the campfire.  
BTW - if anyone is interested in some pix of the Lyre River (Olympic) 
campout I finally got my photos back.  p mail me and I'll attach some 
jpg's to a message for you.
