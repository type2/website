Subject: Re: [T2] Bryant Baecht lives!

Thanks for keeping us posted, I was wondering if he had crossed the Rockies
yet.  Just for the record, I tried to get him to install a gas heater, but
he didn't feel he needed one.  It pays to listen to your old shop teachers!!

&gt; For those interested: Bryant Baecht stopped at my
&gt; house in Salt Lake about midnight last night to pick
&gt; up a rear seat.
&gt; 
&gt; (He's enroute from Kansas to Calif.)
&gt; 
&gt; It was bitterly COLD--19 degrees and snowing. And even
&gt; his coleman blackcat with a 5-gal tank wasn't taking
&gt; the edge off inside the '65 splittie. The good news is
&gt; that the bus was running like a champ.
&gt; 
&gt; We loaded the seat and he headed off on I-80 towards
&gt; Wendover, Nev. with plans to stop at a motel somewhere
&gt; in Utah.
&gt; 
&gt; He's my hero...
