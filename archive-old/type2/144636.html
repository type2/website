&gt; I'm not saying your wrong, but I'm curious to know exactly how that could be
&gt; because the inside of the air hose is still part of the same area as the

&gt; of the hose be different than the PSI at the other end of the hose? Are you
&gt; saying that while I'm using the tool, the PSI decreases at the end of the
&gt; hose? But not while it's just sitting?

Yes Todd, the static pressure in the system will equalize to a common
pressure, but what good does that do? Working pressure is the only
real useful pressure here, and yes due to pressure loss, the pressure
at the end of that hose will be less.
