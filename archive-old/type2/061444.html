Subject: Transaxle woes

Dear list,
Driving home today from work when all the sudden, while cruising in 3rd
gear, BANG.... (engine revving due to no load being put on it..) grind
grind........ press clutch and it feels exactly the same..... No gear gives
me any reaction...... coast to a stop, do a visual inspection..... looks
all entact...... clutch feels exactly the same..... (new clutch, p plate &amp;
t o bearing). Get a tow home and am feeling under the weather so I haven't
drained that gear lube to see if there are chunks in there.......  Doesn't
it sound like a transaxle gone baaad??
