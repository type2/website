Subject: Re: [T2] rear end hangs low! (no, not mine!)


&lt;&lt; the rear end of my bus seems to ride lower than the
 front.  &gt;&gt;

The front end of my 70 panel is a good 3 inches higher than the back end!  It 
looks kinda goofy, but with a driver and a passenger, I think it almost evens 
out.  Its about time to get new shocks... I think the ones in there are 
original!
