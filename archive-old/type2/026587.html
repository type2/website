I've already solved my problem, but thought the rest of you motor heads
might enjoy the tale so I'll give you the data and lets see who all can
come up with the correct answer.

OK, here's the story:  

Rebuilt 1776cc type1 with 0 miles, new crank, new cam, new p&amp;c, new
heads.  Bosch 009 in good (near new) condition.  Pair of Weber 34 ICT
(single throat carbs) picked up at a swap meet, properly cleaned and
operation verified by me, but I've never used them before so they are an
unknown.  

Engine runs fine, but no power because the damned thing is running on 2
cylinders.  I can pull off #1 plug wire and idle drops.  Pull off #2 and
no change.  Pull off #3 and idle drops.  Pull off #4 and no change.
Checked spark at coil for all 4 wires and get good spark (visual test).
Verify that #2 and #4 spark plugs are sparking with there appropriate
plug wires attached (visual test).  Dwell meter shows dwell is exactly
right.  Timing light shows 27 degrees advance at 3000 rpm.

Checked compression and it is good and similar in all 4 cylinders.
Verify that valves for #2 and #4 are opening and closing as the engine
is rotated (visual test).  Verify that I adjusted valves correctly.

So, what did I do wrong???  (And if everybody gets the answer right off
the bat I'm gonna feel REALLY stupid!)

POST ANSWERS TO ME, NOT THE LIST and I'll return a compiled list of the
people with the right answer as well as any creative wrong answers back
to the list later.
