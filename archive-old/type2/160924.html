Wow. Looks like I need to start getting a list of stuff together. Thanks all
for all the important input, as I am still learning the ins and outs of
these great vehicles.

&gt; Also, while you're fiddling with the tin, get rid of that fan shroud and
&gt; get the proper one for the engine.  The aftermarket &quot;36HP&quot; round top
&gt; shrouds lack the proper air vanes and can make the engine run hot.
&gt;
&gt;  Hey Ron  George left off also getting rid of the cheap degree pulley and
&gt; the generator crap. . he is right about that aftermarket fan housing
besides
&gt; it not having any therosat flaps or heat outlets. I have seen hundreds of
&gt; those cheap degree pulleys crack and I am not putting them on any more of
my
&gt; engines  later  mark Dearing
