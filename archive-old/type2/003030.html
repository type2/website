&gt;the rear brake adjusting stars:  Does anybody have a foolproof guideline
&gt;for determining which way to turn the right/left stars each time?  

I can always tell which way to adjust mine by the backing plates.
When I use that 'family size' screwdriver to turn the star wheels,
I lever against the backing plate.  After 20-some  years of using
the backing plate as a fulcrum, they get a little bit torn up there. 
Look for 'scars' on the holes in the backing plates.

When you have it figured it out, draw yourself a diagram in
the margin of your shop manual.
