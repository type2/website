Mark--
Same thing happened to me on a trip.  I stopped to refuel and topped it off.
 Went to check my oil and smelled gas, looked over at the left side and it
was streaming down.  Luckily I was still at the station and the mechanic was
nice enough to sell me a hose and clamps for a couple of bucks.  If you
really climb in the compartment and stick your head over there and do a kind
of exorcist head spin you can see it (I would have goggles on to be safe).
 You can also just barely see it from the vent outside looking in.  Made me
replace all my fuel lines, including rebending new metal lines to replace the
rusty corroded ones.  I redid *anything* that gas touches, and I sleep better
at the wheel for it...
