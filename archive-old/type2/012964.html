Subject: '71 bus, full rack and extras for sale
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

I bought a second VW bus this summer thinking that I
could take two and make one.  I needed a few things
off the bus... bumper, lenses, small things.  But what
I really liked about it was that they had just (under
10,000 miles ago put in a brand new engine)  Thinking
I could put this 1600 cc engine in my 1972 bus it was
a done deal. But after many broken leads and deciding
that the engine 70K in my 72 bus is good still. I
realize that I don't need the new engine.  So, I'm
putting it up for sale.  What else is included?
Working 4 speed manual transmission. 
Good brakes, tires, exhaust.
Stove, sink, two full rear seats (great condition)
cupboards full front seat, All interior trim
many lights and lenses
A FULL removable roof rack (very sturdy and in good
shape)


what's missing?
The bottom (frame) is decaying
The front axle has rusted through. (not functional)
rear bumper, mirrors, a few lenses.

it's a 1971 bus with over 500,000 km on the odometer. 
Everything has records and is in excellent shape.  The
engine looks like it is still brand new and fires
right up, i have been running it once a month during
winter.  

I will part out any of the little things/removable
things.  But whoever takes the engine can take the bus
with it.  Make an offer on anything if you are
interested.  For the engine i will give you all of
it's records if you do want.
