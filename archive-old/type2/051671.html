Subject: RE: [T2] 2 questions, How, and WHAT!

you pressurize the resevoir with an air pump (has a schrader fitting, just
like your tires.)  the valve is tucked in behind where the resevoir filler
is (on the kick panel in front of the passenger seat).  

mine doesn't hold pressure.  anyone talked a pressure leak on that system
before?

also, i too am wondering what the pull knob under the driver's seat is for.
mine no longer has a cable attached.

the concept of what I &quot;should&quot; be doing.

8)&gt;First question, how do you pressurize the windshield washer 
8)&gt;bottle on a 70
8)&gt;bus?
8)&gt;
8)&gt;Second question, what is the little knob underneath the 
8)&gt;drivers seat?  It
8)&gt;attaches to a cable that goes under the car somewhere.
8)&gt;
8)&gt;Thanks a bunch...
