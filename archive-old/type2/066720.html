&gt; that stuff didn't work for me. I applied it to a brand new Dansk exhaust
&gt; pipe that I had sanded down to bare metal. The stuff was let dry for a few
&gt; days, then installed. Didn't take long for the paint to bubble up and come
&gt; off in flakes. Btw, unlike the name would suggest, POR-20 should *not* be
&gt; painted over rust.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe I did something wrong in the prep work and it's my fault, but I
&gt; don't know what.

Sami - 

Dank. Bummer. I've had pretty good luck with POR-15, and was hoping the
POR-20 stuff was as good... I guess the question goes back out then - is
there a good exhaust/manifold paint?
