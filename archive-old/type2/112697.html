Subject: Re: [T2] cu

&gt; A CU engine is a aircooled 2 liter engine with 2 carburetors, electronic ignition and
&gt;   hydraulic lifters come from a square (Vanagon?) VW bus T3 built between 80 and 83
&gt;
&gt;   A CJ engine is a 2 liter aircooled engine from a T2b Westfalia 78 Bay window dual
&gt;   carburetors, normal lifters and ignition; and a bit smaller aircooled housing
&gt;

Hi All:
I just received my new type IV case from a shop in england. It is for a type 2A
bus sold in England. I am not sure what type this was (bus or vanagon body).
Anyway the case has no markings, that is no engravings for CU####, CV#### or
CJ####. The housing lip appears to be the same size as the CV case. The case is
supposed to support hydraulic lifters and an old lifter I have fits fine. Any
way to make sure that this is a hydraulic case?

It also differs from my CV cases in three ways:
1. The breather vent tube is tapered (1 inch on the bottom about 1/2 inch on the
top) versus straight,
2. The threads for the bottom rear mounting studs (on the flywheel side) are
smaller than 10 mm. I do no know the size at the moment, but they appear bigger
than 8 mm.
3. It is equipped for a mechanical fuel pump.

Anybody know anything more about the type 2A?

Regards,
