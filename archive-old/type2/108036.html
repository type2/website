Subject: Re: [T2] Engine In!

Working in a garage with a nice smooth concrete floor and a proper jack, I
wouldn't hesitate to remove and replace a TypeIV engine by myself.  Heck,
even on my rough asphalt driveway, on a hill, I've removed and replaced
engines many times, usually with the assistance of only my wife.  It sounds
like you installed the engine without everything attached since there's no
way to remove and replace the moustache bar with the heat exchangers in
place.  Yes, that bar has a &quot;front&quot; and a &quot;back&quot;!

&gt; The deed is done! My avp rebuild is finally in the bus.  It took four guys
&gt; (and one chick running the grill) to get it done.  It took a while to
jockey
&gt; into place, and we R&amp;Red the moustache bar twice. It was kind of a bitch
&gt; with four of us (well three actually going at it); I can't imagine doing a
&gt; T4 alone like some folks talk about.  Well, my hydrualic jack is kind of
&gt; half-assed.  Hopefully it will be running by Friday...
