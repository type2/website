Subject: RE: [T2] RE: Temp Gauge

My experience (71 westy, stock 1600 DP, well broken in) has been:

Around town:  Oil temp - 180, CHT - 275

Highway, level: Oil temp - 200, CHT - 300

Highway, uphill, wind, etc.: Oil temp - 210, CHT - 325

Many other listees have reported higher than normal temperatures during
breakin.  My engine was well broekn in before I installed the gauges, so I
have no experience with that.  Also, many listees have reported type 4
engine temperatures significantly higher than yours (like, normal oil temp =
260), so based on that, yours is lookin' pretty good.

&gt;
&gt; My VDO oil temperature gauge shows lower temperatures (highest I ever saw
&gt; was 210 deg. F), but I also found it to be accurately calibrated.
&gt;

i just got a temp gauge as part of my new engine from albequerque.  i found
it to be
VERY frustrating initially and stopped looking at it also. i think we have
finally
come to an understanding ;-) but i'd like a few outside opinions.  when i
first got
it in late september in new mexico driving home through grand canyon area
across hwy
50 in nevada north to oregon i rarely say temps under 220-230.  spent a lot
of time
at 240-250.  spiked to 260+ going up second gear mountains. (i stopped)
then going
down would go to about 230-240.  this was all after i had been told by shop
that over
230 was a bad thing. so here i was with a brand new engine never under 230.
arghh.
it was 80* some of the time. there was higher temps when sun was shining on
bus. i
figure there were all these new parts breaking in causing friction = heat.
so i just
kept going. albeit frustratedly.... i did not drive faster than 65 usually
60.

so now i am in oregon. it is much cooler. oct. nov dec drive around mostly
at 180! if
i floor it up a hill it goes to 220. can cruise 70mph at 180 provided no
wind. wind
drives it right up to 220. inclines that do not require slowing but are long
and
constant raise it too.  so it seems to be functioning adequately.  Just
drove home
from Seattle at 70 mph 180 for 4.5 hrs till i hit wind then slowed to 65 and
maintained temp. for additional hour.

spent january in arizona and california. found that it generally cruised at
180*
except for going up techachapi pass then crept up to 220.  around the
country side in
teh 70*s it seemed to hang on the high side of 180 at 60 + mph. one day
leaving
phoenix temp went up but highway gained elevation and temp was 80* still not
over
220.  (i did get it to go to 250 once by accidentally forgetting to shift
into 4th
but that was the only real spike)
drove 20 hours in one day up i-5 maintained 180-190 the whole way except the
peaks of
the northern mountains going into oregon. but that is common.

so my question is what about those hotter temperatures initially. now it
seems ok but
what are the limits.  what is the 'red line'?? i think it is logical for the
engine
to be hotter in hot climate or outside temps but how does that affect what
to do?  i
sure can't drive around at 50 to keep the temp below 200 in summer so in
summer is
220 ok and winter 180???
i have driven aircooled vw buses since 78 and bugs since 74. never had a
problem
always just made sure i never drove with my foot to the floor or the engine
screamin.
  so new tricks for an old dog who is very skeptical and inexperienced with
the
parameters and their clues of gauges.
