Subject: Rear shift rod coupler

Hi all
I replace the front bushing and it makes a definate difference. The one
I removed was worn to the point of looking like the remnents of some
old rubber cement.

I also have the rear coupler that I would like to replace. It has 2 bushings
on the side of it and I think it resembles a u-joint. Can I replace this
in the bus, or do I have to pull the Tranny and Engine as per da manual?
Thanks,,,,,,Chip        '74 Bus
