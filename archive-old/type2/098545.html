Subject: Ebay: the polls are in!

Note first that no one is objecting to posts refering to ebay (or similar)
auctions when looking for information about something contained in an
auction.  Only posting of the auctions themselves to the list (for the
purpose of advertising the auction) is in question (and currently not
allowed.)

I've not recieved a vote in 3 days, so I decided to tally where we stand.

No ebay auctions on the list: 16
Yes, lets see those ebay auctions: 14
Undecided: 1


Included in the above counts are the following additional suggestions:
&quot;I want ebay auctions, but if they take over then we should stop them&quot;: 2
(2 for Yes)

&quot;Tag the auction posts wiht [ebay]&quot;: 3
(1 for No, 2 for Yes)

&quot;Limit to two posts per inprogress auction (one at the start and one near
  the end)&quot;: 1 (yes)

&quot;Disallow auctions posted by the seller, only allow them from other
  people&quot;: 1 (yes)

&quot;Lets add a third list/lets use the buy/sell site on type2_dot_com&quot;: 3
(2 for No, 1 with no vote)

Looks like the charter, regarding ebay auctions, stays the same.

thanks for your opinions.

...david
