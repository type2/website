Subject: Used Bentley and Muir books available

I have three used books.  All of which have plenty of life still in them for
those who need. Each book is available for purchase via a $5 PayPal donation
to the type2 list via tedebare_at_type2_dot_com.  Each books state is listed below.
I'll pay for shipping in the lower 48 states.
