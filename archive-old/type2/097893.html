&lt;&lt; One other option I have thought of is to drive the '73 out to the west
coast next June on my biennial &quot;roundabout&quot;, find a body, stop for a week
and work myself blind doing the swap on the road.  Not the vacation of the
century, but a definite thought :-)

pulling into an interstate rest stop with one and a half so-so vehicles and
driving away a week later in one good one...?-)
You're a better man than I am, Gunga Din...
