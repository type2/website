A Friday topic, but not too far off the mark.

If you are looking for books about VW's try going to &quot;21northmain_dot_com&quot;
I was just there and they are currently listing over 400 books--lots of
duplicates, but lots of variety,  too.  If you're into books at all this is
a very intersting site; easy to use and so far I've had good luck buying
through them.

FYI,
