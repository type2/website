Make one change at a time - the carbs - then the rockers. That way you know 
exactly which item is giving you headaches.

I think the other poster had a better answer than any I might have to 
offer. Keep us updated.

&gt;Hi Volks,
&gt;Well, to start this saga, I had a great running 1600 DP with Jacobs ign,
&gt;Berg extractor, and balanced to the max. So I decided to play mechanic and
&gt;add 1.25 rocker arms and dual Kadrons. Added the 1.25 rocker arms and ended
&gt;up with the push rods galling against the push rod tubes and a big leak
&gt;developed. Pulled the engine, replaced the push rod tubes, set up the 1.25's
&gt;so they would work right and put the engine back together and in the bus.
&gt;Synced the carbs and fired it up expecting a sweet running engine. GUESS
&gt;WHAT......
&gt;
&gt;Engine runs great- up to 3000 rpm where the power falls off and it starts
&gt;popping. This only happens under acceleration. If I go up a little bit at a
&gt;time, it still lacks power but doesn't pop.
&gt;
&gt;I have checked for vacuum leaks, timing, valve adj., and messed with the
&gt;carbs till I'm I don't know what else to do.  Anyone out there in VW land
&gt;had a similar problem? Any ideas where to look or what to look for? I'm
&gt;clueless (my usual mechanical state). Any help, information, ideas,
&gt;suggestions, ANYTHING, will be greatly appreciated. As always, TIA  TBear
&gt;
&gt;Don't take life too seriously- you'll never live through it.
