&gt; a side question here, My van came with the &quot;Deluxe&quot; torsion bars, but the
&gt; vehicle was modified and is considerably heavier, I have aquired a set of
&gt; the heavy duty torsion bars. 
&gt; 
&gt;   is there any special things to know for switching them, is it just a
&gt; straight swap??

Just make sure that the left bar goes on the left and the right bar goes
on the right.  Torsion bars don't like to work backwards once they take a
set.
