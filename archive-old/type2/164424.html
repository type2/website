Subject: RE: [T2] Rear License Plate Bracket - Update with Pics

Hey Eric,

Did you get my previous reply yesterday? It explains it so I reposted it
below.

Eric,

Federal buses have holes narrow on the engine lid and required an adapter
since they were right off the euro market. The Cali models have wider spaced
holes that bolt up with a US spec plate and don't require an adapter. The
thinking was that the Cali buses would always be in the US, so a different
hole set was used that matched US standards. Also Cali models were only
delivered in Long Beach if my research is right. So in closing, you got a
Cali engine lid for your Federal bus. You will need two generic round
plastic plugs that expand when the screws go in from the front (your federal
used square plastic plugs). They are both readily available at many FLAPS.

This was something Chris and I noticed after parting a few dozen buses. You
can spot a Federal bus and a Cali bus by just looking for the rear plate
adapter.

I have seen about 4 totally unique adapters for Federal buses.

Hope this helps explain it.

Jon Stiles

Hey all,

Here are pics of my old lid (top), and new lid (bottom)

http://images.thesamba_dot_com/vw/gallery/pix/385408.jpg

As you can see, my old lid had two holes, 1 1/4 inches apart (center to
center). Attached to these holes was a bracket to hold my standard US
license plate.

The new lid had two holes, 4 1/4 inches apart.
Plus, they are in the center of the lid. See here:

http://images.thesamba_dot_com/vw/gallery/pix/385409.jpg

The emissions sticker on the back of the new lid mentions 1978 California
emissions standards.

Thoughts on this anyone?

Eric
