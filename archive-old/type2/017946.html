Subject: '72 Oil Filler
Message-ID: &lt;37362CA7.AD56BEBD_at_home_dot_com&gt;

I recently put what I thought was a 1974 1800 bus engine into my 1972
camper. Why I never noticed, but I didnt, but the oil filler is not in
the usual place (coming out below the alternator). It is on top of the
block just above the alternator. Does anyone know why the filler is
there? Is it from a type III?
