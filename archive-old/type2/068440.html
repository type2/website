Subject: Re: Is &quot;Lucas&quot; an American expression?

&gt;Is &quot;Lucas&quot; an American expression for something of a poor design?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I don't work for LUCAS but I have and do use LUCAS parts. I find that
&gt;when used and fitted correctly they are as reliable as anything else.
&gt;Even my horn which does work!
&gt;
Hear, hear.

One of my coils is a Lucas and it's been running faultlessly for 30 years.
VW obviously thought it as good as Bosch because it carries the VW logo and
a VW part#.
