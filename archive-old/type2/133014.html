Subject: Re: [T2] FI wiring order

Richard,

Since they all fire at the same time, I just put mine back the way that
it looked like they came out....and fit well!

The only time I had moved them was when I was testing for bad 
wires...looooong before the bus started getting restored.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I was performing some electrical tests on my FI wiring harness and I noticed
&gt; the injector wiring doesn't match the wiring diagram. The diagram shows:
&gt; 
&gt; N30 #1, N31 #2, N32 #3, N34 #4
&gt; 
&gt; ...but I see:
&gt; 
&gt; N30 #2, N31 #1, N32 #4, N34 #3
&gt; 
&gt; Did anyone else notice this? I labeled the wires before I removed the
&gt; harness so I'm sure which injector connectors are which.
