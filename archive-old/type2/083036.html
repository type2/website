Subject: Master Cylinder to Vacuum Booster O-ring - spec and source?

Volks,

Between the vacuum booster and the master cylinder there lives an o-ring
that keeps air from entering at that joint and destroying the vacuum in
the booster.  When you buy a new/rebuilt MC you *should* get a new one of
these and usually you do.  If for any reason you have to crack this joint,
however, you don't have a replacement and I have not had any good luck
finding them independently. If you don't replace it, then it is likely
that your vacuum assist will be compromised and you will have a cosntant
vacuum leak.

Does anyone have the dimensions/a source for this o-ring?

                           Steve Dolan
