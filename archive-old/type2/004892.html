&gt; &gt; All 116, 123, 126, and 140 body cars. 116 started in 72 with 280SE 6
cyl.
&gt; &gt; and 450SE + SEL V8's, the 6.9, and the 300SD turbo diesel and lasted til
80.
&gt; &gt; 81 to 91 126 is [USA] 300SD and the 380 + 420 + 500 + 560 V8's. 123 is
77
&gt; &gt; thru 85 as 240D, 300D, 300DT, 300TD wagon, 280E. 140 was 92 to 99. But
&gt; &gt; unless it is a total, I doubt you'd find any in the yards.....
&gt; &gt; More than likely, you will find the 116 and 123's.
&gt;
&gt; Found older junked MB cars at the junkyard; Up to the mid-'80s models.
&gt; The newer ones probably go to 'automotive recyclers' that specialize
&gt; in late model MB parts.
&gt;
&gt; If you cannot find a used part in a junkyard, a new one may be found
&gt; at an aftermarket MB parts supplier.  Or found at any MB dealership.
&gt; MB stocks parts for their cars for approx 30 years after their
&gt; manufacture.(what a great concept)
&gt; What is the Mercedes-Benz part no on that wheel nut?

Before 72 will not fit. Older as in 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 113, 114, 115
body wheel bearing nuts will not fit. Even though 107's were made to 89,
they will not fit.
These nuts are right hand thread only, they will not work on the left side
of a split or bay window....only both sides of a Vanagon.
The MB part # is 116 334 03 72. They are not cheap from the dealer, they
have a suggested list price of $19 each and do not include the 5mm headed
allen bolt. AFAIK, they are only available from the Mercedes dealer.
