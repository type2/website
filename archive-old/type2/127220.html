Subject: Fan Housing / Air Flaps

I've been through the archives and the technical libraries looking for
some assistance on type4 cooling air flaps. I think my PO removed the
air flaps when s/he tossed the dual carbs for a Weber 32/36 and the
vaccum dizzy for a 009 (classic 1-2 punch). 

Symptoms: 
I can't find the thermostat. Could be me, could be the bus. I think its
the bus.
When checking the oil, that milky-brown stuff can be found, indicating
its running too cold, I believe.

I'd like to be sure that the PO was thorough in his/her demolition of
the cooling system before I start buying parts. Can I check for the
existence of flaps without pulling the fan housing? In the archives,
Steve Bartnik said that the fan housing can be removed without pulling
the engine. Has anyone done this? Is it any worse/easier than pulling
the ALT without pulling the engine? I haven't found the relevant
passages in the Bentley, and I'd rather avoid pulling the engine if it
isn't necessary. A page number or a &quot;this is how ya do it, newbie&quot;
would be very welcome. I can let the bus sit for a few days in a pulled
apart state (while waiting for parts) if pulling the housing is a
hassle.
Thanks!!
