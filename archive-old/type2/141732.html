Subject: Looking for oil cooler duct seal

Hi,

I am looking for an oil cooler duct seal....the rectangular gasket/seal
for the tin over the oil cooler (part # 021-119-329). Bus depot has it
on their web page but would have to order it from VW:-( That would take
a while.....any other volks out there know if another vendor has any
that they have ordered recently? Anyone have an extra that they want to
sell? Just thought I would ask.

Thanks in advance,

Meg
