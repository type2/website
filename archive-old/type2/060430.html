without going into a lot of detail, it is very important where the piston
is in the cyl at the time that you make your measurement.  I believe that
the middle of the stroke will find the biggest gaps due to the most wear.
Many manuals should have info on this point. 

Have you considered that the oil consumption could also be due to oil
getting in from the head (ie via the valve guides)?  I know this was the
case with a Honda motorcycle I once rebuilt.
