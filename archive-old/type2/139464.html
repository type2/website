Subject: Re: [T2] VW parts store

Funny you should ask. I just found a very cool little shop on the East 
end of Ventura, off Johnson Drive. It's called Larry's Foreign Car 
Repair (formerly Bugrunner.) It's a nice, fairly clean little shop with 
a half dozen busses in various states of decay parked off to the side. 
He says he's got most parts or can order them for you if you like. 805 
656-2525. On Sherwin Ave. Go up Johnson, turn left at Contractor's 
warehouse and then left on Sherwin.

There's also Roscoe's on the West end of town. It's a dreamy little 
junkyard on Dubber's lane, more or less off Ventura Ave. He's got new 
parts as well as used.
