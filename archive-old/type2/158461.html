Subject: Re: [T2] really rough idle, shaking whole bus

 &lt;I do want to clarify for jeremiah at what point he is measuring the
&gt; lash. For all cylinders it should be read at the top dead center of the
&gt; ignition cycle of that cylinder, any other reading is bogus. I'm not
&gt; sure if this has been brought to your attention yet and didn't want you
&gt; to spend a lot of time chasing it down. There are various ways to test
&gt; that you are TDC, Karl has elaborated several times on the list how to
&gt; do it and a search in the archives will give you some great ideas, here
&gt; is one.
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; good luck.&gt;


thanks, jason.  i did test the # 1 _at_ TDC.  the rotor pointed to the mark on
the distributor.  i'm going to look _at_ the link you provided.  checked
several sites last night and couldn't find anything.
