Subject: No pulse at injector in '77 EFI

Hi guys,

I recently became the owner of a '77 Westy that was rebuilt, but the 
re-builder died before he could finish the job.  The engine is in the 
bus and cranks, and all double-relay readings are correct, the engine 
sometimes runs momentarily (probably due to cold-start injector doing 
it's job) but the engine doesn't continue to run longer than the initial 
burst. There is fresh fuel and a spark and the timing seems to be 
correct according to a timing light check. No smell of fuel from the 
exhaust.

I've isolated that the injectors are not being grounded (pulsed) by the 
ECU and so replaced both the ECU and the matching AFM from my running 
'76 Westy. But alas, again, only a momentary start but then doesn't run 
and no triggering (grounding) of the injectors. I realize the harness 
may not match these two items as I didn't change that, but suspect there 
is no real change in that.

I've checked the ground wires and all plugs from the ECU are properly 
plugged in. (there is fuel pressure) The factory manual says (at the 
stage I've gotten to in this) to replace the ECU but don't have that 
exact number, and an ECU from a '75 bus worked in my '76 so I figured 
what the heck, try the '76 in the '77 and see what happens. Nothing 
different. It starts momentarily but then quits probably due to only the 
cold-start injector doing it's job.

Any idea what may be wrong? Temp sensors not in range?

I have to drive this bus out of the driveway where it is soon because 
the owner of the house (an 85 year-old man) can't insure it until all 
non-working cars and ages of debris are removed from his property. I've 
got till next weekend but really he wants it out of there NOW.

Thanks for any input!
