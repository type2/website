Looks like Yvan's whole domain is down, I can't raise uwaterloo_dot_ca at all.
You know as much as I do. Let's give 'em through the weekend and see if
they don't get it fixed.

&gt;I can't post ads or view ads, is this a common problem? Error 01:01 came
&gt;up and I tried to email Yven, but I got a return to sender message.
