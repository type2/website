Hey Y'all, I was wondering what the census is on battery sizes?  I only have
one, and it was 400 Cold Cranking Amps, the new one is 525 CCA.  Is this too
big?  I have a 71 1600dp with stock generator, 55 amp?, and I just want to make
sure that I wont hurt the system or be unable to keep the battery charged.

Thanks in advance,
