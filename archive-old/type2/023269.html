Subject: finished the wipers...
Mime-Version: 1.0

so, thanks to a kickin' boyfriend, he bought me a remanufactured wiper 
motor for my birthday.  i also had the pleasure of him helping me install 
it and lubricate all of the wiper joints in the process.

so...we have wipers.  he has graciously offered to take it today to get the 
state inspection.  good luck to him today.

unfortunately, i have discovered that the bus is still leaking (water that 
is.)  i've decided not to fret about it anymore, but thought i would post 
about it.

i put all new door seal on the bus.  the driver's side door leaked in a 
large storm that we had.  from what i can tell, the rain came in rolled 
under the driver's seat and then rolled onto the floor boards by the pedals 
( the carpet was all wet.)

the rear cushion at the hatch was wet in the rear pass. corner.  all 
underneath, not on top.  that hatch has a new seal too.

then, by the bench seat... the panel where the outlet is...it is wet on the 
floor there too (wet carpet again.)  i had sealed off the outlet very 
well....so, i'm baffled, and a bit hurt i must say.  oh, well.  i'm tearing 
out the interior for a 3rd time.  i just thought i might run it by you good 
folks.

on a side note...i re-adjusted the brakes...again and now it feels 
awesome.  i just need to bleed the brakes one more time...some foam at the 
top i suppose.  then it will be rock solid.
