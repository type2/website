Subject: [T2] strange oil leak and flushant

&gt;My newly aquired 75 westy is leaking oil from the dipstick tube as if the
&gt;back pressure is pushing oil out the tube. It is not overfilled with oil,
&gt;someone from the list suggested a holed piston , Whats that?

A hole in a piston would cause combustion pressure inside the case.

&gt;Some one I know suggested that perhalps some of the galleys are blocked.
&gt;I dont know the mileage or history of this motor but it runs quite good and has plenty of
&gt;power.

No hole in a piston. Check the breather system  for blockage, remove the can
and soak in kerosesne, follow the hoses. There is a blocked case vent problem.
A bent hose will restrict case vent. Try it with the breather box off, no way will
pressure cause oil to exit the dipstick tube.

&gt; Should I use some of the engine flush and hope for the best? I plan
&gt;on removing the exaust to replace gaskets and the seals on the oil filler
&gt;tube. anything else I should look for?

You are asking for trouble with engine flush, try a couple of oil changes using
a pint of Marvel Mystery oil for a couple of days before the change, clean the
screen and change the filter. Look for leaks at the valve cover gaskets and
push rod tube seals, oil cooler, etc.
