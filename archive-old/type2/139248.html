Subject: Re: [T2] 68 disk brake conversion/ powertrain upgrade Q's

Hey everyone,
  I appreciate the feedback on this. A T4 powerplant would be nice and 
easy since I'm familiar with them (rebuilt a couple). Does anyone know 
if the later bay engine support will bolt in to my 68 without major 
mods? This might be moot of course if this corvair block comes through, 
since I'll probably end up going that route, and I believe the adapter 
kit comes with it's own engine support. Really, I'd like to get as much 
oomph out of this rig as possible, since I already have Trixie (my 64) 
and have the slow lane covered. I'm a builder of homes and such, not 
cars, although I've done my share of vw's in my life. I'd like to beef 
her up, but am not really into doing anything too contrived at this 
point. I'm hoping to be able to use Amy (my 68) as my daily driver for 
work mainly and this entails LOTS of hauling heavy 
tools/materials/detritus/etc... on the freeways, highways, and mountain 
roads of the entire left coast. Thus, the more dependable power I can 
get out of her the better.
  As for the disk brakes, looks like I'll be hitting the yards looking 
for a good beam sometime down the road here.
Thanks again
regards
shin
