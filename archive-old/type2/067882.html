I dunno, maybe I'm just cynical here, but what creeps me out about the
&quot;Saturn Phenomenon&quot; is that it seems kind of company-created. I mean, VW
never really advertised the Volkswagen phenomenon, the sort of
collective spirit among the owners. Their advertising was witty, sure,
but it didn't use the community as marketing. Seems to me that GM took
that social thing that was the Volkswagen (or maybe Harley) owner thing
and turned it into a marketing concept, creating the Saturn label and
setting it up as the Volkswagen of the 90's. 

It's like Saturn is to Volkswagen (of yesteryear) as the new Chrysler
Prowler is to a street rod - the co-opting of an owner-enthusiast driven
phenomenon by a big corporation. 

Am I really too cynical? I mean, I guess people really do love their
Saturns... I dunno.
