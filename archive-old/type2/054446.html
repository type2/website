Subject: Tool question

In the November 1996 issue of Hot VWs there was an article on tools and a list of
recommended tools on page 67.  I can't see what 3 of these tools would be used for -
an 8mm and 10mm allen wrench, and a 27mm combo wrench. Where are these used on a
VW?? I have a '71 --  maybe they are used on a split.

Thanks for your help.
