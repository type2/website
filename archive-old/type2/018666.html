hey all ye loving type 2-sters
I've got a (serious?) problem on my hands
I got half...yes half... of my muffler off....it was soooo badly rusted
that I got the passengers side half off.  Now whats left is one nut that
is on a bolt where the exhaust comes out of the rear drivers side....
its one bolt to success now...
but it is stripped.  Half of the mufflers insides, and one of the lobes
that is hooked up to the heat exchangers is hanging now..  it is the
lower nut that is closest to the ground.... it is stripped... won't come
off.
what do I do?
Can I cut it off and replace the bolt that comes out of the engine?
Will this cause major mayhem?  or can I just put on the new exhaust with
one nut on the left side?
Help!  I'm really tired from working under the hot sun all day at
this...no amount of Liquid Wrench cures this...
its a 13mm nut on a 71 hardtop westy...
engine code is B6347872

thanks!

Isaiah
