Subject: Trannys? / Now I have THREE

Are the trannies the same.  I have a good 78.  Do I just need to 
change out the nose cone?

Steve


&gt;  &gt; I couldn't resist.  This morning I purchased my third T2.  This time
&gt;&gt;  a 83 air cooled Vanagon.  Good body, white paint, gas heater, roof
&gt;&gt;  rack, CD stereo, new tires.  $500.

&gt;i think the trannys are the same ... the 80-83 aircools had the same
&gt;trannies as the 77-79 buses. so you should be able to move the 78
&gt;tranny over and get the 83 running.

&gt;nah. it's called 'starting a junkyard'! :)  i'm working on getting a
&gt;syncro and a vanagon pickup truck. :) then i'll start to taper off.
&gt;no, really, i will. honest. :)


My wife wants me to go see someone about this sickness, but I'm kind 
of comfortable with it.  I just need more than a 30 hour day to get 
to all of my projects.  I need to quit semi retirement and go back to 
work so I can get some rest.
