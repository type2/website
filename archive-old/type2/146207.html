Subject: Re: [T2] bolt size?

In a message dated 9/23/05 2:01:38 PM, mail_at_wilbo_dot_org_dot_uk writes:


&gt; Is it the upper bolt by the clutch cable (rather than by the starter)?
&gt; I'm missing that one (have been for a long time apparently), and a
&gt; knowledgeable friend told me it was often left off by less fastidious
&gt; mechanics because it is the most difficult one to access. Doesn't seem
&gt; to have done any harm in 46000 miles, although I do worry about it.
&gt; 
&gt;    If the remaining bolts loosen, the clutch will push the engine rather
than just the pressure plate...Makes for some interesting noises... ;-(
