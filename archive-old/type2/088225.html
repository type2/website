Hi listers

This time I would like to know if I can use silicon ignition wires in my =
1600 DP instead of original cable wires. If the answer is yes what I =
have to look for in a serach of a good set of them.
I am almost forgot, I tried to take off the #4 cilinder spark but it was =
very tight I tried a few turns with my 1/2 socket wrench, but it came =
harder in ecery turn, so I decied to ask to the list, whats is goingon =
here and how can I solve.

From the sunny lands of Caracas Venezuela, thanks

Roberto
