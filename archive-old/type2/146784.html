Subject: upper steering column/column tube assembling

Hi Volks ,
I was pretty scary about what I've seen in my van today and I am so glad 
I check it !!! The previous owner messed up  with  the steering column  
and the upper steering column was half put (or half out - depending of 
your humor!)  to the lower column.
Is anyone explain me how to tune up/put back those two guys together

Thanks a lot

Chris
