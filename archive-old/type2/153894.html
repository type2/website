Subject: Re: [T2] where to put spare on 77 westy ?(AnswerNemo)

&gt; sizable trips without two spares.  One trip I had two belt separations in
&gt; less than 100 miles, and the tires were in good shape beforehand.

I drive lots. Over the past 10 years I've driven to the west coast of Canada 
... maybe 4 or 5 times - and to the East coast of Canada ... at least that 
many. I've driven from to the Yukon border on the Alaska Hwy ... maybe 5 
times  I drive lots.  I can't remember ever having a flat or a blown tire. 
I've had a few slow leaks that I got repaired and I notice my 90 Cabriolet 
currently has a flat after sitting in the driveway for a week or so.  But - 
I cannot remember ever having a flat or blown tire such that I had to search 
for a new tire on a trip.  I know it happens - but for me - at this point - 
the inconvenience of carrying spares that I have never needed greatly out 
ways the cost and 'possible' inconvenience of searching for a tire on a 
trip - assuming of course that my two cans of fix-a-flat and my 12 volt 
compressor won't do the trick.  I would never carry two spares - In my 
entire life I have never needed one (that I can recall).
