The book by Tom Wilson (How to Rebuild Your Air Cooled VW Engine) is
excellent. It is very well written, and has easy to follow procedures that
will guide you through the engine re-building. It tells you how to inspect
the various engine deices (cases, cranks, rods, pistons, etc). I used it on
my latest rebuild, and it made things a whole lot easier. Muir is good for
the 'big picture', but he is a little vague on some of the steps. I like
using the Haynes and Muir to disassemble the engine to a short block
(especially the plastic baggy trick), and I like the Wilson book for
measuring, inspecting, and putting the engine back together.

The good news is that California Import Parts lists it in their catalog, and
when I phoned today, they still have four in stock ($24.95 Can). Their
number is 604 434 8300, Part # ACC C10 9690. They are located in Burnaby, so
they are quite close to you. 

I am no way affiliated with CIP, but I have ordered from them, and I am
quite happy with their service and the quality of their parts.
