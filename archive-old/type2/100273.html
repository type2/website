Hi Jim,

There are endless opinions about the &quot;best&quot; Bus you can buy, and a little 
research can help you make your final decision.  However, there are a few 
guidelines that I've found work fairly well.

1. Buy the most rust-free Bus you can.  These usually come from Southern 
California and Arizona, but can also be found in Colorado, New Mexico, and 
Nevada.

2. If you want a reliable Bus, spend the money up front and buy the 
best-condition Bus you can afford.  Spending money on a new engine and good 
running gear now will save you the trouble of dealing with it on the road, 
in the dark, in the rain.

3. Do as much research and buy as many manuals as you can to help you learn 
how to fix your Bus.  Type2_dot_com is a great resource for technical info, and 
the E-mailing list is a great resource as well.  In addition, the A.I.R.S. 
list is a good emergency and social resource.

As far as I'm concerned, the 1978 and 1979 Buses are the most-evolved of the 
classic Bus species.  The 2.0 FI engine has decent power, and the Westfalia 
conversion for those years is very usable and roomy.  On the down side, the 
Type 4 engine is a little more complicated (especially with fuel injection), 
and the engines are tougher to pull out for major repairs.  With any Bus, be 
prepared to drive a lot slower than you can in a Normal car, but be prepared 
to have lots of conversations with friendly strangers about the old Bus they 
used to have and how cool your ride is.

Good luck!
