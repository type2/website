&gt;I fear that I need a transmission soon as I sometimes pop out of first gear,
&gt;but finances don't allow that just yet.
&gt;I am under the impression(delusion?) that I can go a pretty fair distance
&gt;untill the tranny retires itself. I am planning a cross country journey this
&gt;summer, does this seem feasable? There were no howls or whines just the
&gt;occasional pop out in first....

I could drive that forever. The rest of us pop out of fourth, which is
where you spend most of your time. My 68 does it about every ten minutes
lately.

&gt;...I might forgo some of the stuff after High Sierra  and do
&gt;the Southwest as a bunch of folks are doing that, but I am not a Desert fan,
&gt;so I don't know.... Anyone care to speak for New Mexico?

My favorite place in the world. It's a very big and varied state but if you
want I can suggest routes you can take in a bus and never, ever forget.
Staggering scenery. But note that public campgroups are rare in New Mexico,
private campgrounds are not common either, and expansive, well maintained,
well appointed campgrounds of the sort you find frequently in (say)
Colorado are quite unknown. You have to be the sort who can drive up a
logging road and wing it.
