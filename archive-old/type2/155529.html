Subject: Don's Road Trip Update 2

NOTE: Motel 6 blows. Every single time I stay in one, it's crap. Friday
night we stayed in a Motel 6 in Grand Junction. Urine on the toilet, boogers
on the bathroom walls, condoms for sale in a machine next to the snack
vending machine, etc. Bad.

We took off around 10am Saturday and headed for Vegas. We stopped in Utah to
go to Walmart to get some black RTV to hold the top rubber in the slider
window channel. Walking up to the Guac, I noticed 4 oil spots. Drat! I was
so stoked to not have any oil leaks. I guess 500-ish miles of 70mph did it.
I'll figure out where the leak is once I get to California. It's small, so
I'm not concerned. Just keep checking the oil.

Speaking of 70mph, that's the speed I maintained on the flats and downhills.
The Guac handled 70 easily, with just a nudge on the gas pedal. Even some
uphills it took at 70 at no more than 3/4 throttle. I did notice there's
little difference in pull between 3/4 throttle and full throttle. So I saw
no point in using full throttle ever. If the hills get steep, I drop to
third and hold at 48 mph. Ticked SUV drivers be darned. ;-)

At each stop I check the oil. Dipstick has never been more than mildly warm,
though that's not much of an indicator with a type 4 engine because it
passes through the cooling airflow to get to the sump.

We stopped in Mesquite, NV instead of Vegas because I was too fried. My
shoulders and neck muscles hurt from fighting crosswinds in Utah for hours
on end. We stayed at the Virgin River Casino. $89 for a huge room on a
spring Saturday night. Pretty good. Plus I'm $20 ahead on the slots. ;-)

We'll stop in Vegas so the kids can visit Circus Circus for an hour or two
then on to Anaheim!
