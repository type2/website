I ran the positive
&gt; to the coil, and the negative somewhere.  At first I would manual plug it
in
&gt; before driving away, then unplug once we got there.  

I posted this once, but i wired the fan &quot;+&quot; to the power source for the fuel
pump. That way, when the pump is on (engine running) the fan is on. When the
pump is off (engine stopped) the fan is off.

Works for me.
