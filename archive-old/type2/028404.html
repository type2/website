I am older and a bit settled, I love my 74 but changed to it from a split
unhappily at first. I had to sell the 64 for the silly amount of bux it was
worth because I was broke. I would have both now but not just a splitty, The
bay is like a maturing of a great thing. The split cant be modified
conscience free nowadays either as they are getting thin on the ground. So I
am easier in the bay. Anyway hippies are older now man. &quot;Hippie types&quot; must
be pretending. (ask Thom...)

&gt; &gt; just me, or do certain types of people gravitate to either
&gt; breadloafs or
&gt; &gt; splits...
&gt; &gt; 90% of the daily driver splits I saw, were driven by hippie
&gt; types, where as
&gt; &gt; older, more settled people drove bays...
