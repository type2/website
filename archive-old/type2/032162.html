&gt;4.  Gas heater  (I know these are marginal at best but):  When I run it
&gt;all I get is gas fumes and no heat. Comments?

--&gt; What kind of gas heater?  There are a few types that were put in VW's. 
I personally have a Stewart Warner South Wind heater, which is a less
common one in buses -- S.W. was more famous for making the heater for the
Corvair.
