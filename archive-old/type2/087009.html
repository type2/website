&gt; A couple days ago someone posted saying that their engine would hiccup when idling.
&gt; I believe my '79 Westy may be experiencing the same thing.   
&gt; I remember they said they had an auto tranny and I do also.  Not sure if that is relevent  
&gt; When I start the bus after it has been sitting for a couple hours it will have a rough time starting.
&gt; then the engine will idle and then kinda jump every couple seconds.
&gt; Then I'll get on the highway and cruise all the way to work.
&gt; When I get off the highway it is usually idling real smooth and the engine has stopped jumping.
&gt; In fact it seems to run pretty well.  Then it will sit for eight hours while I'm in work and when I start it it will start hiccuping again.
&gt; The other day it started and sounded like it was gonna cut off right after I started it.  I gave it a little gas and flooded the engine.  I waited a little while for it to drain and it started up no problem.  I hadn't had a problem since.  Took it camping and even drove it all over.  Then yesterday I went to start it and it wouldn't start.
&gt; I whipped out my manuals and tore into it.  The battery was ok.  I climbed down there and connected the terminals on the solenoid w/ a screwdriver.  The motor whirled into action.  Checked all the connections.  Still wouldn't start.
&gt; At Muirs suggestion I tapped the solenoid with a small hammer.  Tried to start it again.  The engine would start, but die as soon as i let the key relax.
&gt; Tapped the solenoid again.  Same thing.  Tried giving it gas while starting it.  Nearly flooded the engine again, but it  began running.  I let it idle for a little while.  Running smooth!
&gt; Does it have something to do with the fuel, or is my solenoid shot?
&gt; (Sorry to whomever asked me to turn word wrap on.  I don't know how.)
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Kyle
