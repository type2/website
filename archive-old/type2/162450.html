&gt; &lt;Any idea where to get a good used one?
&gt;
&gt; i've got a guy's number here in saint louis who said he had a couple of auto
&gt; trannies he would part with.  he's a member of the metro acvw club.  i can
&gt; get a hold of him if you are interested.

make sure you get the right one they are different.  the 010 was used from
75-79 it does not use the vacuum line that the older one does, it also has
the shift linkage on the passenger side the older one has it on the
drivers side (USA left hand drive)
