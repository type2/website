Subject: Re: [T2] Oh Ted!

Hiya Ted, Karl, David, and All.......

Thanks for reposting the donations address.

Considering the wonderful resource we have in The List, I figure that this is 
one address which cannot be posted too many times.  You never really 
appreciate something until it's gone.  So, one more time around....

Type 2 Fundraiser
Ted Finesman
8405 Reading Road
Cincinnati, OH
            45215

Thanks again,

Mike
