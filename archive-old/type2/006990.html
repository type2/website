One of my books suggests a 'poor mans' version of a compression test
from which overall state of each cylinder may be infered.

You will need a tachometer (the same one you use for your tuneups), 4
three inch wires bared at each end, and a jump lead.

Take the HT leads off the distributor (one at a time so they dont get
mixed up) and as you replace them insert the short peices of wires.
You end up with four bare ends stiking out of the top of the distributor
one for each cylinder. Ensure the aren't touching anything. Put one end
of the jump lead onto a good earth. Connect the tacho.

Now start up the engine and note its RPM.

Take the loose end of the jump lead (ensure you hold an insulated part)
and touch each of the four wires in turn. As you touch a wire a spark
plug will be shorted out so the revs will drop.

The drop in revs should be the same(ish) for all four cylinders. If the
drop is less for one cylinder than the other three then that cylinder is
contributing less to the engine speed than the others. ie it has less
compression so should be looked at.

PS take the 4 wires out when the test is done:-)
