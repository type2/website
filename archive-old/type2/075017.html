&gt; Adam wants to cut the top off of the closet/cupboard unit in his westy and
&gt; shorten it down enough so that it won't block the passenger side rear
&gt; window. 
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody seen or done this before? It seems like a good idea to me since it
&gt; avoids the expensive issue of re-upholsering the Z-bed and finding spacer
&gt; cushions for the gaps in the rear deck. 

My bus is like this.  The cabinets were cut off in such a way that
they are level with the top of the z-bed when it is in the &quot;seat&quot; position.

A partition was placed in the middle of the existing cabinet to partition
it into two equal sides, then a top was placed on it with hinges
so it might open towards the seat.

To be honest, I'm not sure if it is the original cabinet cut down, or
if it is just a well constructed replacement.  If it's a well constructed
replacement, the person did a good job as none of the wood is mismatched.
