Hello Volks,

Long time since I've posted. Been busy with other things( making money
to spend on the bus).

The problems is this. 1yr old AVP 2L engine (12,000 miles) makes a
slight missing sound after warm up.  A little thud...thud, thud type
sound,  but it is a back ground sound to the rythm or larger sound.
(hope u all can understand this, i can't).

Anyway, I needed to do a valve adjustment and my buddy thought that
would fix it (I hoped that was all)

So I pulled out Muir's book(No holy wars please!!)  And adjusted them
per his instructions, minus the gap part.  All the way loose,  just
touching then one full turn in.

Ran into a spongy exhaust valve on #4,  tried to adjust for that.  Back
together.  Ignition. (sigh of relief, you never know).  Warm up.  Then
thud...thud,thud.

One.  Some dumb*ss put on a GT aftermarket exhaust, Maybe it just sounds
like that.

Two.  I'm far from a mechanic, but the exhaust fumes are so potent my
eyes tear during timing.  Maybe to rich of a mix in the FI.

All vaccuum lines replaced and checked.  Seem fine.
Exhaust gaskets new and well siliconed with the copper stuff.

Any Ideas????\

TIA
