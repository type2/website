Subject: Rusty engine rebuild

I second the suggestion. I was where you are now about 18 months ago with my
'78 bus. Pulling and cleaning my gas tank stopped a string of maddeningly 
intermittent fuel supply problems that had plagued me since I got the bus. 
Once I got starved for fuel and stranded in a real BAD part of town- at night.
You can pull it yourself and take it to a radiator shop for cleaning for under
$50. Good idea for any old car.

Also, re. rusty bolts. I've never had good luck with Easy Outs. For me they 
either don't work (can't budge screw), or (worse) they break off, leaving 
an immoveable object of hardened, undrillable steel right where you don't want 
it. Someone advised drilling out bolts with larger and larger drills until you
just reach thread diameter, then running a tap through to clear the threads.
That sounds like a better way to me, because if the Easy Out snaps off, you 
have few options but to replace the piece.

John Muir says something about &quot;Sprinkling Lock Ease like Holy Water...&quot; when 
working on rusty bolts. Still a good idea after all these years.

With rusty muffler bolts that have a nut on the other side, you can always 
hacksaw off the nut and then remove and replace the bolt. Screws into cases and
tin, though, are another matter.

Definitely replace any sub-perfect nut or bolt with good quality hardware. Then
if, heaven forbid, you should have to do your engine again soon (like I did),
next time'll be a breeze.  ;-)

Good luck,
Surfer Bob
