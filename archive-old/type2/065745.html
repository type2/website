Subject: Far Out Hightop Splittie &amp; Bubble Campers

Hi All,

At the KC Bug Blitz VW show last Saturday there were 2 really bizarre
Hightop campers.  One was a bubble from New Mexico that is beyond words,
but I'll try.  It's a gypsy-style conversion.  The sliding doord was
removed and it had Captain Kangaroo-style wooden doors in their place.
The roof was made out of wood, part of it resembling a cuckoo-clock.
Many, many other innovational, right-side brain improvements.  He builds
these for people too.  Sorry I don't have the particulars.

The other was a 65 that looked like a hightop, but had normal side doors.
It had a Bob Hoover-style side-flank aux. gas tank, a kitchen with an
oven, dash guages like Swiss cheese holes, a 356 motor, a strange radiator
built into the front bumper and many, many other strange, unexplained 
phenonoma.  NEATO member Leo from Oklahoma had just picked in up in 
Kirksville, MO.  It was on a tow dolly.  This will be something when he
gets it on the road.  8-)
