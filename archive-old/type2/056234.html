I had to do the same thing in my '74.  Here's what you need to do.

I HATE pulling the motor in those things, so I replaced both heads at the
same time.  Cost $400 for parts, they were $175 from AVP 2 years ago.  I'd
suggest doing both, and doing them yourself.  It is hard, but not very.  I
had really only done a few things on my bus before swapping heads, and
managed to get it done in 2 weekends and a few evenings after work.  Very
messy, but doable for a novice.  I'm sure the bottom end of your bus is
fine, although you should check the rings while the heads are off.

I'd be happy to give you tips on how to do it, if you like.
