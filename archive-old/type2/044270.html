The post 67 buses did indeed have jail bars, but I believe that they were 
only in european markets, and they are different from the split screen type. 
Of course, a post 67 bus would not have corner windows, because of the air 
intake.

I think interior panels are different in a standard versus deluxe bus. I 
think I remember reading somewhere that non-deluxe baywindow buses were not 
imported to the US. I could be wrong though
