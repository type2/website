Thank you for saying what I was *trying* to say more succinctly. :-)  Bosch
is a known quality, and that quality is good.  I have no experience with the
Chinese knockoff, but what I've been hearing is discouraging.

If I were shopping for a distributor based just on price, I would 1) be an idiot
and 2) buy a 009.  And while I'm not #1, I'm also not needing a distributor ..
have four or five spares kicking around, even without my stash of good 
German 009s
