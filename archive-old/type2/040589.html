Subject: shocks

Hi All

Thanks to all who responded to my question about lowering a bus.

However, I didn't get any response to my question about shocks,
is there an overwhelming choice of shocks for buses? Prices
seem to go from about $25 all the way to about $75 each. I
don't mind spending the money if the value is there.

I know KYB's are pretty common but have seen other types too.

Thanks

Pete
