Subject: Re: [T2] RE: [Syncro] New found AC Refrigerant

Terry,
         I have owned 7 cars now with 134a from the factory with no leaks or 
problems. 3   Firebirds, a Grand Prix, Dodge Caravan, GMC Sonoma, and a Honda 
Odyssey. I also have an Impala (2001) that so far up to 40,000 miles has no 
problems.  I did one conversion on an older Ford that had 200,000 miles on it 
and it did have a leak when we sold it. All these cars get run up to high 
mileage and are used for mine and my wife's work vehicles. They run daily in the 
desert and I think the constant use has something to do with the reliability. I 
live in the Phoenix area and some of the dealers here readjust the pressures 
before the cars are sold new. Luckily for us in the past the local Pontiac GMC 
dealer is one of them. The Honda and Dodge both work great also and they both 
have Front and Rear A/C. Also the sealers sold make a very clear reference to 
not covering any warranties if they should clog your system and ruin the 
compressor or components. At some point in the future I will put A/C in my bus and 
my Ghia had a system in it already from the dealer but all components were old 
and I took it all out. I will replace it with a newer system as in a Sanden 
compressor and better brackets. Ice in California sells a decent kit. Problem 
with our Air-cooled cars is many holes are cut into the tin for hoses and 
brackets and need extra care in the grommet and sealing departments to avoid 
overheating due to hot air entry where it doesn't belong. The Sanden uses very little 
H&gt;P&gt; compared to the older units.
Just my 2 cents worth.
Regards,

David,
