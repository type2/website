Subject: Replacement for Uni-syn

Michael,

A cost free replacement for the Uni-syn can be fabricated from a ~3 ft.
(1 m) long piece of garden hose.  Hold one end near the carb throat and
place the other end at your ear.  Listen.  Do the came with the other
carb.  Hear the difference?  Adjust throttles until there is no
difference.  Tighten linkage and check again. Loosen linkage and adjust
again.  Repeat as necessary.  (Old trick from adjusting Brit-car SUs.)
