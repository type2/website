Doesn't have to be thick.  22 gauge is fine.  I use 18 gauge for just about
everything.
&gt;
&gt;The ammeter instructions indicate that it should be hooked-up
&gt;in line between the alternator and the battery.  Should I put it
&gt;between the alternator and the voltage regulator, or between
&gt;the regulator and the battery, or elsewhere?

Between the alternator and battery is the only place it will work.  Don't
put it anywhere inline with the voltage regulator or it's not going to read
very high.
&gt;
&gt;I plan on using 10ga wire for the ammeter, is this sufficient?
&gt;overkill?

I'd say it's barely sufficient.  The ammeter is a bottleneck for current
and you don't want to aggrevate the problem.  Use as thick of wire as
possible - at least 4 gauge - if you want to minimize the chance of
trouble.  I've decided that an ammeter is impractical for my own bus, since
it needs to be mounted close to the battery and my battery is in the rear
of the bus.  I get by okay with just voltmeters although I frequently get
ammeter envy.  Good luck...
