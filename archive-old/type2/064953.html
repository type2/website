&gt; Not to be rude (or to expose what could be percieved as fool heartiness on
&gt; my part) the '67 Westy Resto from Hell has cost WAY more than what you have
&gt; mentioned. To me it sounds like you are just getting warmed up. Like the
&gt; word &quot;love&quot; many folks toss about the word &quot;resto&quot; as if they know what it
&gt; REALLY means. Both can be wonderful and both can bite you in the butt and
&gt; cost you money. As I warn you, Mr. Ron VanNess and others contemplating a
&gt; &quot;resto&quot; &lt;or love&gt; Start off with a good one, have fun- and keep it in
&gt; balance with all other aspects of life. If it gets to be &quot;no fun&quot; then it's
&gt; not worth a dime. A one night stand or a quick &quot;once over&quot; paint job might
&gt; get you through (and might be all you need) but both might leave you
&gt; momentarily satisfied but ain't the same as a long term relationship or a
&gt; thorough restoration.
&gt; Your choice on the 'cab sounds like a good balance.

Your comments are very applicable.  If you're going for a resoration 
that you plan to make &quot;yours&quot;, do it right.  Even if its not your 
own STILL DO IT RIGHT!  Find a clean bus-- one that you can do right. 
 And even if you want to restore a rust bucket, it has to be done 
right.  There's nothing worse in my opinion than someone who just 
sprays over rust.  Earl Scheib is in the house!  Talk about living 
for the day and not thinking about the future at all. 

Thom's the man when it comes to doing his barndoor right.  Removing 
_ALL_ the rust, fabbing frame pieces, all that stuff that really 
needs to be done.

In the resto of this single cab, I quickly realized that it's not 
good enough to spend the $5000 to get it perfect.  It already had the 
wrong wheelwells (60's) welded back in, and has the wrong decklid 
and apron (66- 67), fiberglassed in rockers, and quite a bit of rust 
in the cargo compartment.  To straighten all those aforementioned 
items out would be close to $1k I figure.  See, that's the point that 
I'm talking about.  Where when it come right down to selling it for 
what you've invested, that $1k would be down the toilet. 

I should qualify my resto by saying that I am sandblasting the entire 
thing, and trying to do my best while keeping it within budget.

And like someone else mentioned they best VW to buy is the one that 
the PO has taken the bath on the restoration costs!  So Thom, you 
want to sell that barndoor to me for only $5000.  Ok!  &lt;GRIN!&gt;
