Subject: Dormobile: Good, Bad or Ugly?

I just saw what I believe is a Dormobile getting all dusty under a
carport in Ojai, CA. It's not listed for sale and before I knock on the
fellow's door and beg, whine, plead and throw a connipition, does
anybody have experience with the same?

How robust is the Dormobile top? How about the interior appointments?
