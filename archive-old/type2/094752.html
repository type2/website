Subject: Re:Re: [T2] Distributor Vacuum Advance(Is this correct)?? 

Sorry if this is old...it is all very new to me and the book talks about 
static timing being the best way. So does the retard vacum come from the 
dome side or the flat side? Do I need to take the advance vacum hose off? 
Should I feel vacum coming though the hose to the flat side at idle? (I 
don't but there is vacum to the domed side).

Thanks Jon
