Subject: Re: [T2] Trailer Advice

[...]

An old friend's dad, a retired mechanical engineer, had a lively little side
business converting folks' boat and cargo trailers to accept the same
wheels/tires as their towing vehicles.  Many of his customers ran their
mounted snow tires on their trailer, switching wheels around as the season
required.  He's gone now, but the concept is still viable.

And George is correct in his comments about wheel/tire size.  Just think of
how many revolutions/mile an 8&quot; wheel/tire/bearing assembly turns, compared
to a 14&quot; automotive wheel/tire/bearing assembly.  You might get by for a
while hauling some plywood across town from the &quot;Home Center&quot;,  but the
first time you hit the highway it's goodbye tires and bearings.  If you're
lucky you'll spot an imminent failure and get safely stopped off the road.
Often the first clue that something's amiss is when the bearing seizes on
the axle, the trailer attempts to execute an aerobatic maneuver, and people
get hurt.

If you choose to run small tires/wheels on a trailer for highway use,
establish a conservative inspection and maintenance schedule.  And be
prepared to replace bearings, seals, and lubricant during the course of your
journey.  [Don't forget a trailer jack!]

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Bigger wheels are definitely better.  The 8 inch wheels have tire life
measured in hundreds, not thousands of miles.  They also tend to go boom.
Back when I was using trailers regularly I finally switched to hubs that
allowed me to mount standard automotive wheels and tires.  It would be
nice to have hubs that matched your bus wheels so that the spare would
work on both vehicle and trailer, but that is blue-skying it!  &lt;&lt;
