&gt; True, but driving and shifting while holding a cup of coffee in one

I solved the problem by building a modified replica of the Westy  
camping stool... complete with two cup holders :-)

In any case, the item you've described sounds very cool, Ron.  Kudos  
for once again coming through for the Type 2 community!
