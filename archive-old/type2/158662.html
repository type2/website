I avoid eating Macs, including but not exclusive to,
i's, Mini's, and (especially) Big's... ;-(

BTW, I finally contacted Bus Depot about my wind-
shield seal...Mine's 9' 5&quot; in circumference, hence,
way too small to fit...I &quot;thought&quot; it was the one I 
had ordered years ago for another Bus, but obviously
not...Maybe a Bug windshield...?-(
