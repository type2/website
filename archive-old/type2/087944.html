&gt; &gt; I was thinking of purchasing a pair of aftermarket air scoops  for my 71
&gt; &gt; westy, i was just wondering if they are worth it, ie.. has anyone used
these
&gt; &gt; and seen significant results in cooling? my bus doesnt overheat now,  it
was
&gt; &gt; just a nice preventative maintnance idea for the summer.. any input and
past
&gt; &gt; experiences would be appreciated .. thanks.. peace.. scott 71 vesty
&gt;
&gt; Air scoops will do nothing for a properly maintained bus.  They _may_
&gt; lower temperatures in a bus with missing engine bay seals or other air
&gt; leaks into the engine bay.
&gt;
&gt; Make sure your engine bay seals and tin are present and correct.  This
&gt; will yield much better results than a tack-on!
&gt;

These scoops will actually RAISE temps at slow speeds, since the purpose of
the vents is to allow hot air to escape, not to induct cool air.  I would
warn against them.
