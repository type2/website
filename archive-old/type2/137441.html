&gt;In short: there is no place to grab that darn drum brake to pull it out. 
&gt;Instead, use a punch to gently tap the drum out by hitting the drum through 
&gt;the &quot;check the wear hole&quot; in the backplate. Hit a little and then turn the 
&gt;drum and hit again until it comes out. Hit only the drum, not the brake shoe 
&gt;:)

I find it's often rusted about the hub and some penetrating fluid sprayed in there really helps.
