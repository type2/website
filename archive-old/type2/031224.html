I had a 412 and the air is sucked in between the rear sheet metal and the
inner wall of the body,  couple inches thick, there are some grills on the
sides that allow the air in.

&gt; &gt;noticed an apparently rubber bellows attachment to the fan on the motor. 
&gt; &gt;Anyone know/have a 411/412 and know where this bellows takes air from?
