Subject: Re: [T2] Re-calibrating AFM?

I have experimented with this in the past.  DON'T DO IT.  That spring
tension is what is calibrated on it.  If you fiddle with that, you mess with
the way the air flap opens and closes in regards to the air volume coming
in.

If you have diagnosed the problem as the air flow meter, replace it with
new/ rebuilt one.  But, if your problems are running too rich, etc, and you
have not had your exhaust gas analyzed and the CO set with the AFM, then do
it.  It is a lot of little things that make injection run
great.............Tend to all leaks, rebuild injectors, etc.
