Subject: Re: [T2] speedo adjustment?


Correct. When I wrote &quot;There is nothing to adjust in a speedo head if it reads
too fast.&quot;, I was answering the original question as to 'what could HE adjust'.
Here is William's original question:

&quot;I have 71 westy and the indicated speed is around 20-25mph+!!!!....when you
take apart the speedo, what do you adjust to make it right? How difficult is
it to take the speedo apart?&quot;

Then the one about adjusting the spring came up and I replied &quot;Whoa......&quot;

I thought my explanation about the speedo needle and how it works was written in
as simple as could be written so a LAYMEN could understand it but I guess
not.....

I guess I won't be sending any thing more technical then 2 + 2 = 4 to the list
anymore.....




&gt; Karl:
&gt;  There is nothing in the speedo head for the LAYMAN to adjust. Speedo shops
use a
&gt; magnetiser-demagnetiser to adjust the magnetism in the magnet. It must not be
very
&gt; difficult,

Well, it is a little difficult if you don't have a 4 pole magnetizer.
American cars use a 2 pole magnet. A 2 pole magnetizer will not work on VDO
speedos.



&gt; because a usual price for a speedo overhaul/ calibration is about $75.
&gt; $75 won't get you very much these days!
&gt; My first 70 bus clear back in  1982 read incredibly high, not because of the
&gt; tires. I suspect others in this era were also off. My 69 double cab seems spot
on,
&gt; however.
