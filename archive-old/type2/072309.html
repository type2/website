I picked up a '79 bus, a California-style exhaust, EFI, Electronic ignition, 
hydraulic lifters here in Philly from a Rasta dude (who was leaving in a 79 
Westfalia is great shape for CA) for a little bit of nothing. 

It missed and there was gas in the oil. It backfired, but no problemo, the 
exhaust leaks were ubiquitous (for those from Arkansas, that means they were 
everywhere). 

The brain was bad. #4 was a solid light when testing, and the 5th injector 
(the enrichment injector) was disconnected to prevent flooding. It never 
fired #4 correctly. I replaced the brain (thanks to my buddies in 
Perkiomenville: The Bus Depot). And I replaced the exhaust. 

Here is the problem. 

It is still misfiring on #4 even with the correct brain. I have fire. I have 
fuel (and not too much fuel). I have air. I checked the valves and they seem 
to be opening and closing right. I checked (and replaced) the injector. The 
original was borderline. The compression check showed no problemo on all 
cylinders. Timing is OK. 

So, whazzhappening here? I would hate to abandon this project after 3 months
and the money invested. I have to drive this little darling home to Texas 
sooner or later, so it needs to run well enough to make it to Tejas....
