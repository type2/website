Subject: Re: [T2] Engine stall erraticaly

Roberto,

Fuel starvation...did you really run diesel/fuel mix when things were bad 
there?

Something in the tank blocking the gas pick up tube?  
Did you pull the float valve out of the carb when cleaning?
This once happened to me and it was a piece of rubber from the
hose floating around in the float bowl.  Every once in awhile
if would cover the main jet and die....suction went away, and then
I could drive it again for awhile.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hello Volks
&gt; I had a problem with my bus 1977 1600cc upright engine H30/31 pic solex
&gt; carburetor and mechanical fuel pump.
&gt; I was driving on highway and after reach the 60mph the engine stall, I reduce
&gt; the speed and the engine runs ok, a few miles later the same problem, finally
&gt; up hills the engine almost die and recovery for a while stall badly again and
&gt; recovery.
&gt; When I arrive home the engine start but die immediately (the fuel pump I
&gt; thought) but when I checked, it was pumping, so I took out the carb and clean
&gt; everything and the bus runs smooth, I drove out for a few miles and everything
&gt; was ok.
&gt; This morning after a short ride the engine stall again up hills but runs in
&gt; idle whit no problems on a level surface.
&gt; Any clue ?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks from the sunny lands of Caracas Venezuela
&gt;
