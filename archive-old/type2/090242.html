&gt; Anyway the rain looks like it is coming in near the vent window

No.  Well, OK, we probably have some buses on the list where it does not
leak, but it is a very leak-prone area.

&gt; Can I just buy another piece of glass that is the
&gt; full length and install it in place of the vent? Will glass from the other
&gt; side work?

Yes and yes.  What you propose is the usual solution.  Be ready to deal
with a substantial amount of rust when you pop that window out.
