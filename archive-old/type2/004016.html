Hey Volks,
I found some tin from someone parting out a 74, will it fit my 76? This is a
'net' deal from Kentucky, so it is a bit of a drive from Florida to see
first hand. I think I will have him send it to me and hopefully it will fit.
If it doesn't I am sure someone out there needs it.

BTW I need a thermostat bracket if anyone has one they want to let go.

TIA
