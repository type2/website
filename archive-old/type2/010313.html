Hi and Help!

I just freshly rebuilt my 1.8L motor from my 74 Bus and have installed it
and am attempting to start it. It won't start, after a couple days of
cranking, and adjusting this and playing with that. I'm getting backfires
out of both the carbs and the exhaust.

I've statically timed it (verified #1 was at TDC, checked alignment of
the timing marks, pulled cap and rotor was in proper position, firing
order correct), checked fuses, wiring (carefully labeled), tested for
spark (good), tested for fuel from the pump (good flow--it's an
aftermarket electric pump), slowly rotated the distributor around--even
pulled the dist. out and turned it around 180 degrees just in case, tried
using starting fluid, etc. Nothing seems to work.

Any suggestions? Tips?
