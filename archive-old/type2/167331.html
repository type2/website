That's a strong endorsement that it wasn't good enough.

&gt;and really might be a better motor than the  type4,

That's a whole other argument...

&gt;I like redux boxes, 
&gt;things will climb like no tommorrow,

Not a bad idea for a crowded euopean city but impractical here in USA.

&gt;sliding door was first offered on a 
&gt;split,

Only as an option. How many have you seen?

&gt;small gas tank still got 250 miles  between fill ups,

That's because the reduction boxes and that sewing machine engine and all that city driving.

&gt;and everybus made was 1950  safety rated even bays.

C'mon. While both are of a similar design the split is far weaker up front in the safety dept.

&gt;Your list  isn't holding up  too well :)

One you make all the upgrades you suggest that are standard baywindow features, I suppose it doesn't! :-)
