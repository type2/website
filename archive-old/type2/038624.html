Subject: New Bus Nightmare

I too am sorry to hear about your troubles after buying your dream bus.
I know I would have been just as upset as you are. BUT I have to agree
with several of the other people who posted to the list that you should
give the guy a chance to make good.

I can tell you that I recently sold a 66 Beetle. I told the person who
bought it that it was in excellent working condition. It was a daily
driver,  that it never gave us any trouble, and that I would feel
comfortable driving the car anywhere. It wan't a mint condition car but
to this person it was her dream car.

They happily drove off with a AS IS bill of sale. Two days later they
called to say the engine died. They never went into detail just that
they had it checked out and they were going to get the engine rebuilt.

While I felt VERY bad that this happened I didn't feel that I
misrepresented the car in any way. I did offer to give them back $200 of
the purchase price but they were very understanding. After all the car
was 34 years old.

I know you paid quite a bit of money for the bus but it is after all
over 30 years old.
I wish you the best of luck and try to give the other guy a fair shake
in making good.
