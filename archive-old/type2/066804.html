Subject: late bus Ambulance Fans

Hi, the optional fans that Bob Wallace is referring to are the non-US model late
bus
Ambulance fans.  They were usually only available on CDN models, and other Euro
and non- North American models. Just about every CDN late bus i've seen ( which
hasn't been many, but nonetheless..) had them.   I've never seen a US model with
them in it.
