Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for california bug decklid

I don't know what other years it was found on, but the '74 model had this 
feature.  I had a '74 California car.

&gt;Think one of you California folks might be able to help me out.........
&gt;
&gt;I am looking for a beetle decklid that had an opening behind the license 
&gt;plate that opened with a little thermostat rod when the motor got a certain 
&gt;temp.............
&gt;
&gt;Please pmail if you have one you can sell.
