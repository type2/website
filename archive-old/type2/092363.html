Subject: Re: [T2]  Re [T2] New problem was &quot;Sparkplug stuck please help&quot;

Moght I suggest: 1.) coat the spark plug thread chaser (that's what it's 
really called) with wheel bearing grease to catch the chips. 2.) Now's a 
good time to learn about ANTI-SEIZE.  A little dab'll do ya.

&gt;Put in your NEW spark plugs (otherwise you'll just be re-introducing that old debris) and screw them in.
