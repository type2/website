I have placed 2 pages on my web page, they are gif's &amp; about 70k. just click
my home page &amp; then delete &quot;/lazybays&quot; as these (due to their commercial
nature) are hidden. You will find the directory format, look for Sco1.gif &amp;
sco2.gif (note caps for the s in sco1). If you want prices, I will send them
dated Feb 97 &amp; can inquire about shipping etc..

&gt;In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice.
&gt;But, in practice, there is.
