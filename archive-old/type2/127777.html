&gt; What happens just as often, I'll bet, is that some guy decides to sell

&gt; engine and tranny.&quot; Smart buyer. The guy thinks he's ahead, but is
&gt; stuck with the bus-no-engine. Then he has to wait around until someone
&gt; else is willing to buy that.

I think that a lot of it is the tin.  Engines are available to anyone who
has the money to buy them, but the original German tin is much more
difficult to get right.  I had to scrounge for months and spend
considerable time tweaking and brazing to get my tin back to orignal
shape.  It would be really tough for me to part with that if I anticipated
ever owning another VW.
