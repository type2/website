Subject: Re: '74 bus tranny problems

&gt;Here is the list of symptoms for my tranny. I am trying to figure
&gt;out if the tranny is bad or if it is just in the linkage. The
&gt;local shops want $200 just to pull the tranny which I could
&gt;do myself. But if it is just the linkage then I can take the whole
&gt;bus to them. Any way here it goes.

&gt;1. Tranny oil leaking from the point where the shift linkage
&gt;intersects tranny.

I have never had a leak here, but...

Disconnect the shift rod coupling from the tranny.  Check the shaft 
going into the nosecone for play.  There should little if any play 
in this shaft.  

If there is play, then it could be one of 3 things:  The outside 
nosecone brass bushing which can be replaced with the tranny in, The 
inside brass bushing of the nosecone, or the ball that keeps pressure 
on the &quot;hockey-stick&quot;, both of which require dropping the tranny and 
removing the nosecone.

&gt;2. VERY Loose shifting, difficult to tell if I have it in gear.

Check the shift rod coupling for wear in the cage and/or the two 
bushings.  Replace if needed.

Check the front shift rod bushing.  You will have to remove the gear 
shift from the floor of the bus and take the front half of the shift 
rod apart to change it.  When you replace it, check for wear on the 
shift plate on the floor.  When replacing the gear shift you may have 
to adjust to re-align it to get it right.

&gt;3. Grinds about 80% of time when I engage 3rd gear. If I do it
&gt;just right I can get it to not grind but this trick is tricky.

This could be as simple as the shift plate on the floor being out of 
alignment.  You could experiment with moving the plate forward and 
back to see if it solves the problem.  Otherwise it is probably the 
synchro going out.  I used to have a bus that did this &amp; I learned 
to match revs so it didn't grind.

&gt;Any help would be appreciated in this matter.

Good luck!

Dave
