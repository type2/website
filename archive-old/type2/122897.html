Subject: Pushrod tube seals

Hi everyone.

Does anyone have a name/part number for pushrod tube seals for a '76 2liter? 
  I'd like to pick them up locally(Atlanta area) and tackle this job this 
weekend.  They don't even have to be Viton, as anything is better than what 
is there now.  Thanks much.

Hope the holidays are everything they need to be for everyone.

Mike
