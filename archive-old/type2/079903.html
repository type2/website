Subject: Pedestal carpets

Hi, Rob

I have a lovely set of black pedestal carpets and the carpet for the
walkthro, bought from a company called Individual Interiors here in the
UK.

If anyone desperately need their phone number, mail me at
mike_at_specialpatrolgroup.co_dot_uk and I'll find it.

Mike
