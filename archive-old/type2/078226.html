Subject: Beating of a dead horse!

I can almost hear this dead horse neighing as I continue to beat it, but: Timing setting on a 34pict3 - 009 set up to avoid hesitation. After extensive archive research and much list conversation on this subject, I just want a GENERAL CONSENSUS of where bus owners who run this combo set their timing, I don't necessarily want the correct answer, just what individual people are doing so I can make my own judgement. I know, I know, bigger jets, etc.  BUT assuming I do NOT what to change carb jets, and that I want to keep this combo in my bus, and that the engine is a 1600 DP, and that Elvis REALLY is the King, where would you set YOUR timing? I apologize for the thorough punishment and running into the ground of this subject, but I have read and heard so many diiferent ideas that are &quot;BEST&quot;, I just want to know what people who have this set up ACTUALLY do.
