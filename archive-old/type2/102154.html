&gt; &gt; &gt; injector. I did a continuity test on both of the

&gt; &gt; &gt; it all checks out good. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; all 4 injectors fire at the same time, so try
&gt; &gt; switching wires between #3
&gt; &gt; and #4 and see if the problem is the injector or the
&gt; &gt; trigger circut
&gt; 
&gt; Did that, and when I do the 'pull each dist wire' to

??? you mean injector wire???  if distributor wire then there is a firing
problem not an injector problem

&gt; test which cyl is the problem, the problem cyl moves
&gt; to the other cylinder.

sounds like a power problem rather than injector

&gt; My thought is maybe the resistor pack on the firewall.
&gt; Could I bypass the resistors for a short time to test?

no gotta have the resistors,  I would seriously consider the resistor pack
if all other things are workiing, resistor packs are easy to find in junk
yards since they rarely go bad
