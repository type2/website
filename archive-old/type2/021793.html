Subject: Re: [T2] Where's my engine number?

Yeah, as much as it may suck, it's probably a good thing to pay
attention to the KIDS every once in a while.. hahaha :) :) :)

&gt; I bought a 71 Deluxe 6 weeks ago and I just got around to checking the
&gt; engine number on what I believed was the original engine. It's a dual port
&gt; 1600 but under the generator pedestal is NOTHING. There is no hint of a
&gt; number anywhere. I have yet to remove anything from the engine yet as my
&gt; wife won't let me work on it until my other projects are done, you know the
&gt; non-hobby projects. . . at least she let me buy it!
&gt; 
&gt; But where is my engine number do I have a Mexican or Brazilian engine case
&gt; perhaps? The only hint of lettering I can see is an 'M' stamped right behind
&gt; the crankshaft pully.
