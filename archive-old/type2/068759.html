Subject: Strokin' and engines

 I will tell you what I've turned and it fits Bobs description of
2 stroke 4 cycle. He can nod or ignore us as he is wont to do. :-)

 The only place in engine calcs that &quot;stroke&quot; is a value is in 
&quot;Indicated Horsepower&quot;. ihp = PLAN/33,000.

 Where &quot;P&quot; = mean effective pressure of exploded gases in psi

       &quot;L&quot; = length of STROKE in feet

       &quot;A&quot; = area of cylinder in square inches

       &quot;N&quot; = number of POWER STROKES per minute.

 
 It goes on to say: In a four cycle engine an explosion takes place
on alternate down strokes of each piston. 

 This means the crankshaft makes 2 revolutions for each power stroke.

 Then if we are considering a four cylinder, four cycle engine,there
will be 4 times 1/2 = 2 power strokes per revolution.

 In an eight cylinder engine there will be 4 power strokes per rev.
 (end quote)

 Nowhere else will a definition of &quot;stroke&quot; mean squat.

 I know I have been in error, one that carries over from the 8 cylinder
cars. They are truly &quot;4 stroke&quot;.

 Our favorite beastie is a 2 stroke 4 cycle in the engineering sense
of the word. Knowing that I can calculate a value.

 OTOH many of you will prefer to keep your definitions and that's 
OK by me.
