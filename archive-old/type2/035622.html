Subject: cold tranny prob

OK - I used to think I was having a weird CLUTCH problem when the bus was
cold/just started, but a sudden flash of -DOH!- just hit...

When I started the 70 for the first time (and esp. when it was cold), the
car would rock forward a bit, very perceptibly.You could hear and feel the
motor straining  a bit under this load. When very cold, this load would
stall the  motor. So for a while I was starting the car up with the clutch
pedal in, while I tried to think of things that could cause this; pedal
play too loose, too tight, bad return spring, t/o bearing, etcetc.

TODAY, I had the DOH! I was sitting there WITH MY FOOT ON THE CLUTCH to
avoid this problem and I realized: when I start the car, I always have it
in NEUTRAL - the clutch has got nothing to do with it!  In neutral, the
engine is engaged to the tranny, but nothing should be happening; yet it
was.  Pushing in the clutch simply disengaged the pair, so that SOMETHING
in the tranny was NO LONGER spinning. And thus taking 'away' the sypmtom.

SO. WHAT in the tranny is boogered that is spinning when it ain't s'posed
to, causing the axles to turn?

As an added clue, 1st has been getting hard to get in to lately - I often
row thru all the gears while at a stoplight to 'reaquaint' the gears and
levers w/ each other :)

Remember - this is all w/ a COLD tranny... goes away when warmed up, and
yes the level is full.
