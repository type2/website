Subject: Re: Loss of compression in newer 1600 Mexi

I do my valves first thing, with a dead cold engine, and do the compression near the end, as part of the warm-up tasks.  My valves have never been tight, and if they need adjustment at all, which is rare, it's generally to take them up a mm or so.  Thinking I might have misadjusted #3 this time, I check the adjustment again the next morning, and it was dead on.

The odd color of the that plug, in comparison with the others, mystifies me.  The cylinder would seem to be firing hot, but how?

Thanks for your replies.
Jerry


&gt;each tune-up I generally check the compression.  I've been getting about 
&gt;110 (+/- 2).  But this last time, the compression in #3 was 85.  Also, the 
&gt;spark plug in that cylinder was grayish-white, whereas the others were 
&gt;brownish-black.

&gt;Any thoughts?

What is your normal cycle? Compression Test first then valve adjustment or 
the other way around? How did you do it this time?
