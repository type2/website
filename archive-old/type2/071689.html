Subject: Now I have THREE

I couldn't resist.  This morning I purchased my third T2.  This time 
a 83 air cooled Vanagon.  Good body, white paint, gas heater, roof 
rack, CD stereo, new tires.  $500.  I'm testing the engine now but it 
sounds good.  Might have a rear engine seal leak but thats easy. 
Muffler needs help but I want a one piece anyway.

The problem is the transmission is trash!.  Where is the best place 
to get a  GOOD rebuilt at a reasonable price?  I have a good 78 trans 
if anyone wants to trade for a 83?


I'm planning to use this as my tool and work van so I'm ripping out 
both back seats.  Any one have need of these FREE.

Wish me luck.

I just can't bring myself to giving any of these up, and I'm 
beginning to think of myself as a New Urbanist.  Go figure!
