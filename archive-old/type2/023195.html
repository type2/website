Subject: poptop issues
Mime-Version: 1.0

Volks,
While I was at the junkyard this weekend, I managed to pull the driver's 
side rear hinge off for my 1975 Westy poptop.  Mine had a bow within the 
track and made it difficult to open the top.

So, I put the &quot;new&quot; hinge on and followed the directions in Bentley...well, 
as much as I could.  The manual told me to loosen the 3 bolts on both 
hinges and shut the top, then tighten the bolts.  Well, you can't tighten 
the bolts with the top down.  So, I made sure it would latch, then had 
someone lift it high enough for me to tightened down the bolts.

Now, here's the issue....the top is still sticking on that side, and I'll 
afraid that the pressure I am putting on that hinge will bow my new hinge 
as well.  The passenger side moves more freely than the driver's side.  The 
main support arms are in good shape and don't appear to be damaged.

Does anyone have a better way of adjusting the top?  Or has anyone solved 
this problem before?

Thanks in advance!!
