Volks, 

I am cutting virus posters off not to punish them, but to protect
the list.  I have gotten half a dozen responses already and I am sorry I
wasn't clearer.  Yes, this list may well be the source of their infection.
I regret that deeply.  But if I do nothing, then the re-infection goes on.
As soon as I get a working filter (yes, we had and have a filter; no, it
is obviously not catching this virus) that may change, but for right now,
if you send in a copy of the virus, you are gone.  sorry, but I think it
has to be that way.

You've done enough.  Have you no sense of decency, sir?  
At long last, have you left no sense of decency?
