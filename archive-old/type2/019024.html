I went to the wrecking yard today because they told me they were getting
a '77 bus in, and I needed some body parts. I got them all, but all in
marginal shape. The most important was the steering wheel, PO put on one
of those cute, small, useless after market wheels. It perfectly blocked
all the instrumentation, had no turn signal return, and was a lot of
work to drive.

This wheel has a small crack, but worst of all is they added one of
those 'truckers balls' to hold on to, and cut grooves into the wheel to
mount it. It was almost like desecration... A wheel cover shoudl fix
that tho..

Anyway, this wheel sits about 1/4 inch above where it seems it should
sit, almost against the ignition shroud, and there is no way the horn is
going to work and dust will surely collect in this sensitive area (turn
signals, wippers, etc.) So I was wondering if I could raise the shroud?
or do I just have a wrong wheel, mine is '76, and I can't imagine such a
change in only one year.
