&lt;The following is an example and I've got to say that it kinda ticks me off that two supposed experts can be 
so narrow minded.&gt;

The reliability of any vehicle is directly related to the abilities of the person maintaining it, and the person driving it. Bad mechanic or bad driver and you've got junk. 

FWIW my bus never let me down. My heater did need help but with everything intact and in good shape, it makes enough heat.
