You should have an inline filter between the tank and the pump.  You
should NOT have any filter or other obstruction between the pump and the
carburetor.  If you have not done so you should also have your carburetor
fuel inlet tube swedged into place.

A Volkswagen fuel pump is a diapham pump and works by pushing fuel from
the pump to the carburetor.  This creates a vacuum on the tank side of the
pump which pulls fuel from the tank but the work of the pump is a push.
The maximum pressure the pump SHOULD develop is low  but if there is a
defect it can double. If the hose from the pump to the carb is clear and
the inlet tube is firmly attached then the worst that will happen is that
the pump will overcome the float valve in the carburetor and it will
flood.  If there is a filter blocking the path or the inlet tube is loose
then the system can burst and cause an engine fire.

                             OOK!
