&gt; Folks,
&gt; The squeek gremlins have visited me again, and I still haven't cured that
&gt; other squeek in the front suspension. If you hear a van going along the
&gt; street which sounds like a horde of mice, its probably mine.
&gt; This time its the fresh air fan in the heater box under the dash. (82
&gt; aircooled)
&gt; how easy is it to get this box out, so I can lubricate the fan bearings?

Geoff:
I was not aware that 82 air-cooleds used them, but it's probably the
same motor and a similar box to what was used in the 82 diesel.
If that's the case, it's a big snail shaped centrifugal blower with a
321 part number. My advice would be to get a new blower assembly from
someone like Bus Depot. I've had the same problem on my 82 diesel and
the motor is not readily able to be re-oiled. That didn't stop me from
drilling 2 holes in the plastic housing and dripping oil on the
bearings. That was 2 years ago and now it's squalling and burning out
the fuse. 
Also, it was necessary to totally remove the dash to get to this blower.
Not a really big deal, because I needed to put in a new heater core and
a windshield wiper shaft, but it was still probably 6 hours work!
  One hint- I removed the steering column support screws (they have
torque sensitive shear off heads) with a fresh new Knipex pliers.
Installed them with it too. The idea of using these is to keep one from
over torquing the attachment. It needs to be tight, but not too tight.
In case of a collision it needs to slide to keep the steering column
from crushing the driver's chest.
  Your other squeak is the inner control arm bushings. These eventually
fail, particularly where subjected to salt on the roads. They get rust
inside and the rust tears up the rubber. It's really a pretty easy job
compared to many other front end repairs. The 10 inch long bolts that
form the pivot actually has cam washers on the  front and back so the
clock position of this bolt  regulates the camber of the front wheel. In
other words, mark the  position of the cam on the front near the bolt
head with scribe marks so you can reassemble in nearly the correct
position. The bushings themselves are pressed into the upper control
arms and each has a tiny tack weld that I ground off with a Dremel tool.
I own a ball joint press and it was quite simple to press out  the
bushings after taking the pivot bolt out. You should be able to rent a
ball joint press from a good rental yard. 
  I'm giving you these directions in reverse. You first need to raise
the offending wheel by lifting with a floor jack under the lower ball
joint. This will compress the spring somewhat and take the pressure off
the upper snubber. Then take off the wheel. By using the portable ball
joint press, I do not need to remove the upper control arm, nor
disconnect the brake hose. Though it would be a good time to replace
your brake hoses as some of these cars are now 20 years old! It will be
necessary to have a good front end alignment afterwards.
  I'm sure you can get these bushings from Bus Depot or other
aftermarket sources. I paid about $20 each (4 to a car). Volkswagen gets
about $75 each, so it's worth it to shop around.
  It's pretty weird about how these things fail. Of my 4 Vanagons the
only ones that have failed have been on the LOWEST mileage vehicle.
(my brown 87). It has also led the most pampered life. The bushings
started squeaking around 50k miles and were totally shot by 80k miles.
