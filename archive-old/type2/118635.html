Subject: 180 degrees of separation

By the way,
if you dizzy is 180 degrees of you can rotate the drive gear at the bottom
the dizzy shaft by 180 degrees.  The rotor will then point 180 degree back,
mind the plug wires naturally, they have to be shifted forth
(counterclockwise) by two positions each on the cap.
