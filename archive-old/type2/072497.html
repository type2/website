This weekend, I took my 1971 bubbletop camping up to Northern California. While I was happily cruising _at_ 55-60 MPH, when, all of a sudden, the bus started accelerating by itself, and there was nothing I could do!!!
I could not get it out of gear, and braking the bus was out of the question!! (Overheated brakes from trying to stop the bus my brakes)  When I finally &quot;snapped&quot; it out of 4th gear, I smelled the burnt clutch!! Pulled over to the shoulder, and shut her off. The little spring on the carburator had snapped in two!!! The throttle on the carburator was wide open!! I temporarily fixed it with, believe it or not, the spring from my pen!!! I hooked it up to the carb, and to my amazement, it worked pretty good!! Now the bad news....the clutch was fried, but I did limp into King city (she refused to go over 40 MPH), where there was only one garage that could help me. They replaced the clutch, and the throw-out bearing. The only spare clutch and throwout bearing in the whole town!!
This &quot;little&quot; incident did cost me $500.00 US!!!! They completed the job in about 2 hours. Now my question is.....does anyone make any &quot;lifetime&quot; springs for the carb?? Why would that little spring snap?? 
Thanks for all your help!!!
